I am a big Vinnie Jones fan and this was by far one of his best performances. He and Samantha Mumba had great chemistry and worked very well off each other. I do have to admit Patrick Bergen was the scene stealer. I really enjoyed this movie. Great story, Great characters, and Great action you can't go wrong.",1309910400,2,438,4.353658536585366
2597389,4,B000G1ALDO,"I just saw this movie the other day and really enjoyed it. Johnny Was is not great cinema, but it definitely entertains. I like Vinnie Jones in just about everything so it was an easy rental for me. Really though, Patrick Bergin is the film's highlight. His Flynn was the catalyst for most of the action and his one liners are a riot. I also appreciated the Jamaican Yardie angle and thought that Lennox Lewis put in an acceptable performance. Johnny Was was fun and the historical ties made it a little more interesting than it otherwise would have been.",1227225600,,555,4.56

2597391,5,B000G1ALDO,"Simply Awesome!  Vinnie Jones delivered his best performance as Johnny Doyle a man struggling to get away from his past.  He is absolutely convincing as a troubled former bombmaker with a conscience.  I'm really starting to become a fan of his work ever since I saw him in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Their was an interesting parallel that was drawn between the forces of Irish terrorists and that of the local neighborhood druglord, Julius.  Lennox Lewis' role as Ras, a Rastafarian radio DJ adds depth to the story.  He has a ""zen"" presence that complements Eriq La Salle's character who is simply after one thing: money.  The dialog was brilliant; chock full of dozens of quotable lines.  I highly recommend this to anybody that enjoyed Snatch or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.",1159920000,2,794,4.82962962962963
2597392,5,B000G1ALDO,"I loved this movie...terrific plot, amazing acting, casting, everything was done well.  The story twists and leads to a brilliant ending, it is surely worth the fast-paced 90 minutes.  Extra plus is you are a reggae fan and can appreciate an eclectic, edgy soundtrack.  Highly recommended.",1159574400,2,289,5.239130434782608
2597393,5,B000G1ALDO,"But this one has a different spin to it.  This film shows the seedy underbelly of London like most of those hi gloss ones don't. And while Layer Cake, Lock Stock, etc. are great this film has an authenticity and feel that the others cant match.  I don't know how the director got such good chemistry from this diverse cast, but all I can say is.....hats off.  This is an exciting but thought provoking action/crime flick I would recommend to anyone.",1157068800,4,449,4.518518518518518
2597394,5,B000G1ALDO,"If you like British Gangster movies, this one won't let you down.  It's got a GREAT cast.  Roger Daltrey from the Who even does a small part, as does Eriq La Salle from ER and Vinnie Jones from SNATCH and LOCK STOCK.  Solid reggae throughout, lots of action seens, a few amazing car chases through europe a la Ronin...  I'd rent it again on a rainy night.",1157068800,7,355,4.253731343283582
2597395,5,B000G1ALDO,"First: VINNIE JONES rules! But I was really stoked another former soccer player, John Fashanu, was in the movie as DJ Fash! The movie rocks, and not only for the amazing soundtrack by ADRIAN SHERWOOD... there's a story behind the explosions, seriously, it's not all guns and tough dudes... Great movie, for real.

8128347,5,B000G1ALDO,"Saw this film a few years ago on U.S. TV. Good, fast paced, the way it was filmed brought me right there.
It's fiction, a reminder to the critics. Got it for $6, what a deal. But like most UK films, I had to use sub-titles the second time I watched it to get all the slang. The characters  don't have to be real , how many are in films. It's a good story.",1427328000,,355,3.7972972972972974

8128350,4,B000G1ALDO,Ok this is a British crime story. Bad guy Vinnie Jones is trying to go good but they just keep pulling him back in!! LOL Having said that I really enjoyed this film. I found it really entertaining but if you're looking for cinematic perfection I'd pass but if you enjoy a good British action violent crime movie.... check it out. The really odd thing here tho is the casting. At least a couple of them with Roger Daltry and especially Lennox Lewis. The latter playing a Jamaican (not really) drug dealer.....sort of street sensei that everyone seems afraid of but totally respects. Oh did I mention he also is a reggae radio host from his apartment? Ok it's a bit far fetched at times but I enjoyed it thoroughly .,1377216000,,714,4.458015267175573

8128353,2,B000G1ALDO,"This movie got a high rating by all it's reviewers but for me I wasn't impressed I'm a fan of British gangster movies but this was lame. Wasn't sure where it was going, it had many characters different plots and some action. But still in the end and how it ended was a let down.",1312934400,,278,4.072727272727272
