The conflict here is attraction of opposites, and then boy meets girl, almost loosing girl then outcome is forever.  This is for the romantic spirit, the true believer.

1986943,5,B0001CJ8XM,"If you are a Mormon and want to score points with your wife, take her to see ""Charly"". If you're not a Mormon and want to see a love story that makes you laugh then soak a Kleenex and does it without swearing or off-colored humor, take her to see ""Charly"".
""Charly"" is the story of one Charlene (aka Charly), a free-spirited art student from New York who is set up with a strict Mormon boy, Sam, to introduce her to the beauties of Salt Lake City and the Mormon Church. A rocky relationship turns into love that promises to last forever.
Heather Beers plays a convincing role as Charly who is unpredictable throughout. Jeremy Elliot plays Sam who remains the rather dull Mormon. Adam Thomas Anderegg directs the story by LDS author Jack Weyland into a beautifully-crafted (on a strict budget) adaptation for screen.",1035849600,12,815,4.627586206896551

1986966,5,B0001CJ8XM,"What a wonderful movie. Decided to look up my name ""Charly"" and this popped up. Read the synopsis and had to give it a watch. In the beginning, it wasn't the best acting, then I gave it a try. I ended up falling in love with the story and love how God was the center of it. I am a believer but didn't think this movie would be of faith. I highly recommend this movie I give it 5/5 stars. Hope everyone is having a blessed 2018.",1515974400,,427,3.9195402298850577

1986992,5,B0001CJ8XM,"I loved this movie!!! One of the most beautiful and realistic love stories I have ever seen and I have seen them all. What is ridiculous is the horrible, negative reviews I read until I could not anymore. Such lies. Trolls!! Amazingly most of the negative reviews seemed to me to be written by people who had issues with spirituality. Jesus is real not a lie or a figment of the imagination. The proof is in the fact that so many found the movie but then rejected it for religious reasons. Why were you looking? I know the Holy Spirit led me to view this movie. I actually turned away a few times and doubted based on the reviews. Then tonight I just gave it a chance and I was not disappointed. This movie is the story of the beginning of a sweet but complicated love story. Also the middle of a challenging picture of two very different individuals that eventually have one very beautiful person in common. Their hearts fall in love. Deeply!! Then, yes, the end is sad but very heartfelt. We humans need tears to remind us of who we are and who Jesus is. Mormon, Catholic, Christian...I did not see a separation here. Jesus either brings us together or Satan separates us by these labels. I do believe any open minded, openhearted person will love this movie and be inspired. The music is lovely, the Cinematography is beautiful. Each actor nailed their part. Very good job on the casting. The writing is superb. This one goes in my keeper file. Enjoy!!

1987005,2,B0001CJ8XM,"Strange movie.  Billed as a romantic comedy, and I guess it started out that way, but it devolved into a VERY religious drama with a very sad (if true-to-life) ending.  Not at all a feel-good movie.  I wanted something light and funny and was left feeling sad.  I'm a devout Christian and enjoy some of the overtly Christian movies out there like War Room, for example, but this wasn't just generic Christian theology, it was LDS doctrine, straight up, no ice.

It takes a bit getting use to in the beginning, mainly because of the Sam character, but Charly kept me watching.  It does get a little heavy handed with the religion and faith but it did so in a way that added complexities to the characters and story not to push religion and faith.

1987031,4,B0001CJ8XM,"Yes, the acting is a little slow to start. Yes, the male lead doesn't seem to have the finer points of his character fleshed out for the first quarter (or half) of the movie. Yes, this is a movie about people of the Mormon faith. I am not Mormon and when the lead started trying to lead Charly to his faith I panicked a little and almost turned it off. I stuck with it though. I am Christian, though I am not sure if Mormonism is considered Christian, but I sometimes even find overtly Evangelical movies too pushy, especially when the storyline takes a back seat. I thought this movie dealt with faith as a real part of the characters' lives and while personally I find no rational reason for Charly to have accepted the Mormonism, I can understand she was trying to fill a void. The truths in the second part of the movie, regarding death and God's plan vs. our plan however, were well played and theologically could have spanned many Christian faiths and was (mild spoiler alert) more useful than a canned God grants miracles to all good people who truly believe, YAY happy ending.

All in all the characters and their interpersonal story drove the movie enough that I could enjoy it for what it was--a story about two people trying to handle what life put in their paths to the best of their ability in a thoughtful and candid manner.

I've come to learn the descriptions are short and you're going to get surprised sometime. However, this was way better than the rom-com turned ""assisted suicide is the new heaven"" movie I got tricked into.",1499990400,4,1545,4.514285714285714

1987047,1,B0001CJ8XM,"I glanced on this because I thought, hey is that the badass lady from How I Married An Axe Murderer? Sadly it wasn't, but it made me grateful for Amazon's fast forward option. Poorly plotted, acted, scripted et al, making Lifetime look like HBO. Worst of all, apparently Jesus is their third wheel, ""saving"" her from her free-spirited self.

Disgraceful and disrespectful to all women. Obviously, it made my blood boil.",1498608000,2,359,4.538461538461538
1987049,2,B0001CJ8XM,"I don't normally write movie reviews, but this movie really duped me. Don't watch this if you're expecting a romantic comedy. The description should really say that this is a religious movie/tearjerker.

I started watching the trailer to make sure this was a romantic comedy. I thought it looked like a fun ""manic pixie dream girl"" movie, so I skipped the rest of the trailer to avoid spoilers, and started the movie. At first, I thought it was just that the acting was terrible. But the characters seemed to make little sense. Who shoots hoops in the driveway in a suit and tie? And she's a New Yorker? I'm one and you could have fooled me. Her accent and look didn't fit. She seemed much more of a country girl. The script also seemed awful in the first scenes. Is the male lead a begrudging son just trying to get money from his dad and to drive his father's convertible (scene 1), or is he the straight-laced guy the female lead, Charly, takes him for (scene 2)? Apparently the latter. I'm still not sure what justified scene 1. It's like the filmmaker started to make a different movie, then was told to amp up the male lead's straightlaced and humorless behavior.

(SPOILER WARNING) There were other problems, too. The supporting characters seemed very 2-dimensional. Charly also seemed very inconsiderate in her ""wild"" ways, like causing Sam's phone to fall in the lake. Her father's motivations seemed to make little sense; they seemed completely a ploy to get Charly to meet the male lead and then to create ""love triangle"" concerns later in the movie.

(BIGGER SPOILER WARNING) It turns out that the intro was all a set-up for a story of how Charly gets hooked into the Mormon faith. There was a story arc there that kind of worked, although I found it unpleasant and unconvincingly quick. The acting did seem to get better, though, or perhaps I started to understand the filmmaker's intention to make faith the main character. There was a traditional story arc, culminating with the happy family. Had the movie ended there, it would have been a trite story about the power of faith, featuring common stereotypes. Charly seemed to be used as the medium to illustrate a particularly short journey from co-habitating New York nonbeliever to a true and accepted convert.

(BIGGEST SPOILER WARNING) Then what seemed to be a second movie started, as if this were a 2-part TV series, with episode 2 another genre entirely--the tearjerker/lead-is-dying one that I usually manage to completely avoid. Here again, Charly was used as the medium for a message about the meaning of faith and ""miracles."" So, while the first part was sanctimonious but cheerful (if lame, unconvincing and lacking chemistry), the second part was sanctimonious and a big downer. What both parts shared is major propaganda about faith, even/especially faith someone comes around to. A movie like this should not be sprung on a viewer.

Honestly, I feel generous giving it 2 stars. But, on the plus side, it didn't have a gross-out scene, like most post-""There's something About Mary""  efforts to draw both men and the romantic comedy audience. And there may be a demographic looking for a movie like this, and, I can imagine even worse religious tearjerkers.",1498521600,,3235,4.830324909747293

1987051,4,B0001CJ8XM,"A very poignant and thought provoking film.  The religious aspect was not the angle that was being played - certainly not in a preachy sense.  But it brought into focus the nature of faith for sure.  However, this film is about many different things: love, faith, compromise and learning to live as you believe.  If you follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, then one should live by those beliefs instead of becoming judgmental when their beliefs and values don't match someone else's.  I feel this film had many introspective teaching moments - again, not preachy.  However, it's up to the viewer to reach within themselves to find deeper meaning.  All-in-all, it was a wonderful film.  The religious aspect, in my opinion, was to create a dichotomy of values between the leading characters which sets up the meaning of the plot. Having said all of that, the film was also joyous, whimsical, highly entertaining and well thought out.  I surely recommend it!  best, ~R",1498176000,4,967,4.877300613496932

The acting was just okay, some of the characters were not believable, but their roles were...if that makes since.  Nevertheless, the storyline is what made the movie.

For reasons that are not readily apparent, she decides the dorky dude is ""intriguing.'  During her short visit of a few weeks, in between learning to paint ""from her heart,"" reading the entire Bible and the Book of Mormon, taking Mormon lessons, and fishing with Dork, a lot, she falls in love with Dork, (who loosens up a bit under her heavy-handed teasing), and converts to Mormonism.

Things are fine until they are not...when Dork learns she is not a virgin (gasp!), and tells her he's not interested in ""used merchandise.""  (What a sweetheart, right?)  Rightfully hurt, she takes the first plane back home.  Dork goes home and his mother lectures him about people changing and maybe he's being too judgmental.  Dork goes to the exhibit and sees her heart-felt painting and comes to his senses, begs his dad for airfare (seriously) and flies out after her.

Dork makes a few attempts to get her to give him a chance, and fails miserably. He goes home, they both do some serious soul searching, and some time later, she heads back to Utah and they get married.

Honestly, the story should really have ended right there, but instead we are fast forwarded a couple of years to baby-makes-three and deliriously are we...that is until tragedy strikes.  It quickly becomes apparent that the story line was merely the mechanism for telling the real story about Mormonism and God's ""plan"" which is almost never what you want it to be.

I see it got several good ratings, so apparently some people found it worth watching all the way through.  For me, the acting was mediocre at best, the writing trite and the story line overused.

It is not the LDS churches fault that many of the movies they've produced have been hijacked and re-released as Rom-com films.  This one just so happened to be so deeply involved in the story that they couldn't remove the church from it like many others that you can't recognize the LDS version vs the edited version.

If this movie was actually about Christianity and not a cult belief I would have loved it. She's seen reading the bible and later tells Utah, I've been reading the book of Mormon. The Holy bible is not the book of Mormon. The book of Mormon takes away and adds to the bible. They must completely skip over that in the bible. Not to add or take away from the Holy bible. I guess since they made a different book they think it doesn't apply to that. And the belief that you are with your marriage partner after death. We are brother and sisters in heaven and those urges are not with us. They have very strange beliefs that completely ignore the Holy word of God.

 Understandable that a criminal gang stealing 10% of its members' incomes, refusing to pay any taxes on that blasphemously gathered funding, and facilitating its members ripping off legitimate citizens via the resulting radically higher taxes on everybody else when they ""deduct"" those payments on fraudulent tax returns would produce such a promotional piece.

They believe that the Book of Mormon superceeds the Bible.  The Book of Mormon is mentioned in the movie.

This is a lesser known movie and it had a limited release.  It is based on the book of the same name, written by Jack Weyland an author known for his stories about and for Mormon teenagers and young adults.

The storyline involves a rather staunch religious young man from Utah who's Mormon who crosses paths with a free-spirited woman from back east.  They strike up an uneasy friendship that develops in ways neither had intended or expected.

I have to admit that I am seldom impressed by ""Mormon-targeted"" popular media, even though I've been a Mormon (a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) all my life.

This movie, however, is one that I recommend.  Though the budget is low and the acting is occasionally forced, the end result is a moving experience.

1987372,5,B0001CJ8XM,"A natural tag for Charly is ""an LDS (Mormon)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Story/dp/B000059TEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Story</a>,"" referring to the famous movie from 1970.  The similarities are apparently coincidental (Charly author Jack Weyland has identified other inspirations for them), but it makes a useful point of reference.  Both are romances between people whose different backgrounds are a main focus, and both ... well, I'll say more below.

Charly was produced by Mormons primarily for the Mormon market, but you don't necessarily have to be LDS or any kind of religious believer to enjoy it.  It does help, though, if you know or are at least curious about Mormons.

In this romantic comedy/drama a straitlaced young LDS man, Sam, and a (compared to him) wild nonreligious New York City woman, Charly, meet on Sam's home turf in Utah.  The first part of the movie centers on building their improbable romance.  Each is destined to learn from the other, and though it's Charly who adopts a new life, it's Sam who seems to learn the most.

There's no mystery in why Sam falls for Charly, especially as played by Heather Beers.  She projects an attractive spiritedness, beauty and, oddly enough given some of her behavior, strong level-headedness.  In a typical Charly moment, she stands in a rowboat while Sam is teaching her to fish and makes an impromptu official-sounding announcement to others nearby that the use of marshmallows as bait has led to poor dental hygiene among local fish.  It's the kind of thing that could simply be silly, but Beers brings it off with charm.  So it's charming *and* silly.  At other times, she's the realistic one, the one balancing Sam's sometimes unbalanced perspective.

Why Charly falls for Sam is less obvious.  She gives her own explanation at the end, but there are hints from the start.  In particular, she seems impressed early on with his firm belief in eternal love between a man and woman, which we are led to contrast with the iffier and more temporal affections she has experienced with her boyfriend Mark in New York.

Naturally, in the middle section of the movie the romance hits a major road block, which involves proper humility/humiliation to recover from.  The last third of the film takes a hard turn.  Sam and Charly must deal with a potentially deadly illness.  This is of course akin to Love Story, but the way it's dealt with is quite different.  The role of faith and the meaning of God's power over death are important themes.  The lessons don't overwhelm the basic human experience, which is movingly portrayed.

This movie is comparable to ""Love Story"" in sentiment/sappiness levels, never quite reaching the level of saccharine that some ""family films"" do, and keeping things real where it counts.  Though quite serious in its treatment of serious matters, the humor is also central, much of it radiating from Charly.

The budget was reportedly under $1 million, but the production values are good.  The acting is strong in the key roles, and effective enough overall.  Heather Beers, especially, is very good, enough to pretty well carry the film herself, though she does get help from the others and from a solid script with a lot of fine points.  Adam Johnson, as old boyfriend Mark, is also especially good, bringing nuance and interest to what easily could have been a cardboard character.  Jeremy Elliott is well suited to play Sam, very convincing.  Jackie Winterrose Fullmer makes a strong impression as Charly's grandmother/confidant.  The score and songs are effective, if sometimes seemingly from about 1975.

I'm not sure why Amazon says this has two discs.  Mine has only one, but it's well packed with special features:

-- audio commentary with director Adam Thomas Anderegg and star Heather Beers
-- audio commentary with producer Lance Williams, producer Micah Merrill. screenwriter Janine Whetten Gilbert, director of photography Bengt Jonsson, and composer Aaron Merrill
-- ""The Making of Charlie"":
. . . ""Getting the Script Right"" (4:13)
. . . ""Casting"" (5:17)
. . . ""Production"" (5:47)
. . . ""Score"" (2:12)
-- deleted scenes, with optional commentary by Micah Merrill:
. . . ""Ena Paints a Dysfunctional Portrait"" (0:47)
. . . ""Edward's Big Blow Up"" (1:48)
. . . ""Bishop's Doin' the Dishes"" (1:05)
-- two trailers and two TV ads
-- snippets of and info on the songs and music used in the soundtrack
-- brief text bios of key filmmakers and actors
-- trailer for the movie RM

Beers wisely begins her part of the commentary tracks with a reference to her husband, which ought to cut down on superfluous marriage proposals.  The commentaries tend to focus on the making of the movie, including technical points, but there are occasionally points about the meaning, especially towards the end.  Author Jack Weyland participates in a couple of the making-of featurettes.  (The titles of the first two deleted scenes are reveresed on the DVD menu.)

The movie is in 1.85:1 widescreen with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, Dolby Digital 2.0, and optional English subtitles.

I'm familiar with things LDS, so I can easily relate to and enjoy that side of it, but what I enjoy most about the movie are things anyone who likes romantic comedies with a serious tearjerker side can enjoy.  The religious themes are dealt with in an interesting, for some probably unexpected way.  I'd give this four or four and a half stars, a fine piece of work for its type (and budget), but I'll add in a bit for the excellent special features.

1987374,5,B0001CJ8XM,"I should start out by saying that I'm generally a fan of Mormon cinema. Given the low budgets, most of the films are remarkably good. I'm curious to see what happens as this particular genre matures over time. Within the genre, Charly's production qualities are well below par. I often felt like I was watching a 1980's made for tv movie. Most of the acting, with a couple of notable exceptions, is also below par. That said, I somehow managed to give this movie 5 stars. It is one of the most powerful love stories I have ever seen because it not only tells of eternal love, but it believes in it. Forgive its failings and listen to the message.

1987397,4,B0001CJ8XM,"I had to knock off a star for false doctrine(s) (we are NOT married in Heaven) and we all know had Charly not converted, Sam, being the true believing Mormon he was, would not have married her. One HAD to change for the other (that other being Charly) if they were ever to marry instead of Sam just accepting her for who she was, but at least Charly truly did believe. I do think Sam was very naive thinking Charly, not being a Christian was still a virgin even after being ""practically engaged"" to a non-Christian man (which I am assuming he is, though there are many Christians who choose to shack up and call each other fiance/fiancee when there is not any wedding date set, just to make it sound better), but Sam IS a Utah Mormon. We will not hold that against him, though, because he turns out to be a really decent guy whose pride almost cost him the girl he loved. Not to mention, Mormon men are taught/brainwashed from birth that a woman whose virginity/virtue is either given or stolen loses value and is better off dead (""Better dead clean, than alive unclean. Many is the faithful Latter-day Saint parent who has sent a son or daughter on a mission or otherwise out into the world with the direction, 'I would rather have you come back home in a pine box with your virtue than return alive without it' "" (Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, Second Edition, Page 124), so Sam's thinking of Charly as used merchandise/secondhand goods is just what he believes because the Church he believes in believes it(Mormon Doctrine states that one is better off dead clean than alive unclean). Anyway, the movie is mainstream enough for even non-LDS and even ex-Mormons, like me, to enjoy, and it does have some funny moments, not laugh out loud hilarious, but the lighthearted kind that brings a smile to one's face nonetheless, and it ends with that hope that this life is not the end, unlike the Godless ""Love Story"".

They survived it all,got married,and suddenly,tragedy strikes. This is a tearjerker. Im not usually a fan of tearjerkers specially as hackneyed as this but I still liked this movie,but I don't love it. Not the best of the bunch,but being an LDS,I think this still provide a good dose of inspiration (yeah i know I am being redundant with the word ""inspiration"" but it truly is inspirational).This film attempted to be funny at times but it didn't really work. I saw this movie 2 years ago and in the scene when Charly was teasing Sam calling him ""Utah"",my institute classmates was laughing but I didn't find it funny at all.

1987399,4,B0001CJ8XM,"I have read the book, and I also own the book on tape. The book was definatly alot better then the other 2 (DVD & Book on Tape). But, this DVD is a must have. It covers most of the important issues that were in the book, although I wish they haden't decided to not show the feris wheel scene where it looks like Sam is kidnaping Charly! although there are actually alot of scenes not in the film, some being changed maybe for continuity? I donno. This is why I gave it a 4 star & not a 5, although it would be more like 4 1/2 stars, cause if they would have had every scene the same as the book, it probably would have run over 4 hours!

 In the long run it was an excelent film, my wife cried & so did I at the end.",1129507200,6,716,3.7986577181208054

From the book to the movie they did a wonderful job in keeping the spirit of the characters and powerfully bring them to life on the screen.  Beautifully done and magically captured.  A must see for all who have loved, ever hope to love and all who have lost one they dearly loved.",1087862400,11,468,4.35632183908046
1987401,5,B0001CJ8XM,"A great story of opposites attracting.
While it is clean enough to take your pre-teens to, it is not naive about the hurdles of modern romance.
I went to see this film with a group of about 10 women of varying ages.  We all laughed.  We all cried.  We all loved it!

1987402,3,B0001CJ8XM,"Okay, so there is some weak acting such that the beginning felt like the start of an old LDS church educational system flick with an updated Johnny-Lingo`esk feel (or was I just hoping for a non-Mormon feel from the beginning that would grab non-LDS audiences long enough to get them engrossed in the real story?).  But it turned into a really good movie (our two daughters both gave it a 'B' which is very good considering they had a suspicion we were not hurriedly taking them out for a movie on a Saturday afternoon just for the fun of it).  On the other hand, they didn't cry at all while my wife cried shamelessly (she cries at anything so that in and of itself is not a major commentary on the emotional impact of the movie), and while I wasn't quite choking for breath, plenty of it hit home hard enough to merit the use of my T-shirt a number of times at the corner of my eyes.

Bottom line is that it ended up being a good attempt at a good story (the person playing Charly was very good throughout; some of the other cast were pretty weak at the beginning, but most seemed to hit their stride and be fairly believable by the middle-latter part of the movie and no longer a distraction from the storyline).  Main points (at least to me) that came across well in the story were acceptance, remorse and forgiveness (best line was ""I kinda like this clean slate thing""), and tolerance.  Dealt (lightly) with non and pre-LDS lifestyles, which was good to see done well.

So, go and see it and take your family (probably 10 and up).  Good enough for non-Mormons; not preachy and shows the faults and humanness of Mormons and non-Mormons alike in a love and life story that should appeal to all regardless of religion.
Not four stars; more like 3.5 because of the acting, but worth seeing.",1043712000,4,1792,4.428571428571429
8009998,1,B0001CJ8XM,"Jesus said, 'I AM the way the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father but through Me'. John 3:16. Very sad, informative film on  LDS culture and converts.  Couldn't help but say that a lot of Mormons refer to their religion as a feeling, or just knowing something. ""Pray with a sincere heart and you will get that feeling"" The thing is that our hearts are deceptive and beyond cure"" Jeramiah 17:9 . Following your heart will lead you astray. The Bible contradicts this teaching "" He that trusts in his own heart is a fool: but whosoever walks wisely, he shall be delivered."" I would encourage anyone considering the idea of Mormonism to test the Spirits and to test the book of Mormon.  With this being said, Mormons are nice people, and very kind, people of high normal values, but I can no condone the book of Mormon nor it's teachings. Joseph Smith was a false prophet, and there is no archeological evidence that supports that the book of Mormonism or it's claims.",1521590400,,975,4.497175141242938
