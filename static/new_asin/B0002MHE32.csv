8029475,4,B0002MHE32,I watched this originally on tv and loved it and have been looking to buy it for a while. It is a shame it is so hard to fine. It is a great series that is very enjoyable to watch.,1372464000,,180,3.525
8029476,5,B0002MHE32,"Betterman is, in a word, hypnotic.  A blending of genres as subtle as it is sublime, this takes the best aspects of horror, mecha, ""kaijuu"" and tokusatsu, and just the right dash of ""school kid"" stories as its raw materials.  The output is a downright harrowing journey down the trail of a mysterious killer and an even more mysterious conspiracy covering its tracks.  Produced by Bandai's best artists, with character designs by the unrivaled Kimura Takahiro, this show somehow retains its psychological horror atmosphere episode after episode, even with all the action and moments of levity.  While this show will probably go over some people's heads, it hits me squarely between the eyes.  Excellent stuff.",1228780800,,709,5.130434782608695
8029477,5,B0002MHE32,"Finally the entire series of Betterman has been put on DVD and at a great price. The series chronicles the exploits of Akamatsu Industries and their fight against the deadly disease Algernon. Along the way they try to unravel the mystery of the creature known only as Betterman. The show was originally featured prominently on G4(then called TechTv) on the now cancelled Anime Unleashed block.

The show is a fusion of action, horror, and science all into one. The series is a bit hard to follow if you don't really pay attention to the storyline. Plus it may confuse a few viewers because genetics makes up a great deal of the show and they discuss it frequently. Still all in all this show is a classic and worth the purchase. If you like anime of the scientific, horror, or just plain action genres this is for you.

Even by today's anime standards this one stands out above some of the now prominent cliches in anime. This is definitely worth the price and then some.",1184198400,5,971,4.574712643678161
