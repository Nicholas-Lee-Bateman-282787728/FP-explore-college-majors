Don't even begin to underestimate this title based on appearance, I thought all the good noise had gore and sexual themes, but this is actually better than NON in a lot of ways... God and Beast is solid, but this has no repeated material, it's live on the CD side, as well as the DVD side, it's all completely unique and the footage is just hilarious... ""I WISH I WAS A LITTLE GIRL AGAIN!"" Dressed in drag, I think they don't take their work completely seriously",1445299200,,535,4.469387755102041
