Bronson delivers some great lines and Curtis falls a bit flat throughout. There seems to be no chemistry between the two leads. Had this been a Bronson and Coburn flick, it would have been a smash hit.

This movie rises above B-movie status mainly because of the rarely photographed Turkish citites, ruins and landscapes. Great cinematography gives it a big budget, epic feel. Too bad it is not available in it's original 2:35 widescreen - the VHS is in full frame.

Definately worthwhile for Bronson fans as he has many great lines. Also worth viewing for the fantastic Turkish landscapes. I don't recall ever seeing them photographed so nicely before.

If you did like this movie, I highly recommend El Condor with Lee Van Cleef and Jim Brown, another little seen film with similar theme and superb shooting locations.",1187222400,,1026,4.8125
