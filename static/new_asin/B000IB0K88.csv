8144653,1,B000IB0K88,"After 60 seconds of Jerky McSpazz's arty camera work and endless cutaways, I forwarded ahead to a few more spots in the movie to see if this was done throughout.  It is, and it is unwatchable.  Literally.
Techniques like this went away in the 70's for a reason.  Mr. McSpazz didn't get the memo.",1514419200,,295,4.425925925925926
8144654,1,B000IB0K88,The highly self-conscious and pretentious pseudo-documentary/pseudo-Dogma cinematography is nauseating. I ditched it after 20 minutes. It's so heavy-handed that it distracts you from the actual plot. Truly unfortunate given the decent actors in it.,1506384000,2,248,6.323529411764706
8144655,2,B000IB0K88,"If you happen to have a free hour or two and want to watch a British comedy, please ignore Amazon's categorization of this movie. It is most definitely not a comedy. A study of the moeurs of a ""red top"" rag newspaper clearly modeled on Rupert Murdoch's British rag the Sun, this is a cynical melodrama that is about as far from comedy as Neptune is from your local Burger King.

That said, the cast is excellent. Sadly the cast's efforts are largely lost to the director's art-house obsession with endless jump cuts, odd camera angles, and the endless back-and-forth between color and monochrome. It's not visually interesting, it isn't a metaphor for the short-attention-span sensation-oriented rag itself, and it's not clever. It's just tedious and frankly enough to give most people a blinding headache before the movie is half over.

In short this isn't a very good film. Under the hands of a much more adequate director it could have been interesting. As it is.... zzzzzzz.....",1493337600,7,982,4.874251497005988
8144656,4,B000IB0K88,"Barring the camera work, which is troublesome to say the least, Rag Tale is a biting, yet amusing, take on the world of the tabloid journalism.  The highly-talented cast would have been better served with a better overall approach to the storytelling, but the film is worth a watch for the commentary on the world that is progressively becoming crucial to shaping public opinion.",1477612800,,379,4.921875
8144657,1,B000IB0K88,"I won't waste much time on this film, because it's pretty dreadful. The camera rotates incessantly like a bad 80's music video, (really, it never, ever stops rotating to 45 degree angles for 2 hours) and the plot, which one of the actors described as 'almost farcical' is just that, in my opinion. It's a shame really, as there are many decent actors involved in this movie, and I can only guess that they all regret it. A total waste of time, unless you're trying to induce motion sickness.",1401408000,5,491,4.52808988764045
