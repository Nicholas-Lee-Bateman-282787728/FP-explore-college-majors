8749614,1,B01B88379S,"Wanting this title in the 1:33.1 aspect ratio and interested in the tinkering to the film on this particular release, I decided to check this version out first. Unfortunately, this was not a real Blu-ray. It was instead a cheap recordable, BD-R. If I weren't mislead by everyone involved, I definately would not have wasted my time with this garbage.

The truth about recordable media is that the content is encoded on colored dye during the ""burning"" process, dyes that begins to break down after several years, leaving you with a useless chunk of plastic and memories of a film you USED to own.

Don't buy CD-R, DVD-R and BD-R products!! Manufactued discs are not that expensive to produce. If people who put this stuff out are too cheap or greedy that they cannot commit to pressed discs, then they don't deserve your money.",1530748800,,827,4.736111111111111

8749616,5,B01B88379S,"This is the best bluray HD quality (full screen16:9) of this 1980s cult classic.  It has been meticulously cleaned and color corrected.  Additional effects were added to the last reel (the storm and finale).  There is an all new credit sequence that includes production stills and effects and some great new music by Mortician.  There are many extras not seen before and two great additions: ""Making a Low Budget Indie"" with writer/director Rick Roessler and ""Producing a Low Budget Feature"" with producer Jerry Encoe.  Also Buddy and Les Bacon in ""No Smoking in this Theater!"" and more fun extras such as sequences that hit the editing room floor, TV spots, theater trailers and a unique hilarious radio interview with killer Buddy who snorts like a pig thru the whole interview...and much more.  If you enjoy this film as much as I do, you'll love this new 30th Anniversary Edition.  Of course I'm hardly impartial...The writer/director.",1478822400,5,939,5.019354838709678
