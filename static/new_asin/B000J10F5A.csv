8148403,5,B000J10F5A,"This dvd feels like Louise Hay is talking you through the You Can Heal Your Life process.  A lot of it is in the book, but the way it is set up in the dvd makes it easier to go through the exercises in an easy to understand manner.",1379116800,,231,3.7142857142857144
8148404,5,B000J10F5A,"I saw this video once and it helped me to understand that sometimes you have to know how to let go in order to receive good things life has to offer. It is truly an amazing video I practiced all the exercises alone and truthfully answered them only for me to read, and it has helped tremendously. I am keeping it to watch on other times when I feel I need to organize my perspective in life. Letting go was something I heard of before just didn't know how to do it and this video teaches how to do just that, and how to be open to receiving good things in life.",1356652800,3,561,4.017857142857143
8148405,4,B000J10F5A,"The Louise Hay movie ""You Can Heal Your Life"" is terrific. This is not that movie. Look at the cover carefully. This is a video study course featuring Louise Hay. It is very good, but I am afraid if people buy it thinking it is the movie, they will be surprised to find that this is not that movie. This is Louise Hay speaking to the audience about How to Heal Your Life. It is an older video.",1349481600,,393,4.051282051282051
8148406,5,B000J10F5A,"I don't know what Wayne Dyer has to do with this DVD, as I haven't noticed anything of his contribution, but Louise Hay has done great job. I bought this DVD for myself and my son, because her book with the same title had turned my life around in the mid 90s. It was a bible to me. I didn't just read it, I inhaled and absorbed every sentence several times. I strongly recommend the book and this video. You just need to know that they're not to be read or watched once and put away. You need to really work with this material and apply it in your life.",1339027200,4,553,4.036363636363636
8148407,5,B000J10F5A,"If you have not heard or seen Louise Hay, you are missing an extraordinary American Icon in life changing positive thinking. I consider her the Leader of Affirmations. Her words, insights and practices can change your life if you are open to the ideas and practice her exercises.

Highly recommend Louise Hay CDs, Books, and DVD's. She is not to be missed for a better life and world.",1326326400,2,384,4.647058823529412

8148409,5,B000J10F5A,"This product is a great supplement and compliment to the ""You Can Heal Your Life"" videos. Even if you haven't seen the movies, it's still really cool. It comes with a bunch of square cards that are beautiful and have neat, life affirming messages written on them. It also comes with a small book to help you use the kit and a bunch of magnets and a small magnet board you can put the magnets on. You can also put the magnets on your fridge. I bought it for myself, but my aunt was going through a hard time, so I gave it to her as a gift. I would recommend it!",1201392000,18,560,4.008928571428571
