8401345,5,B003NWQ0LU,with a star studded cast including the entire Wu-Tang Clan [pre-Ol' Dirty Bastard's death] and including their break out single 'eat dat watermellon' this film is fun for the whole family. COONSKIN 2 4 LYFE,1326240000,6,206,4.914285714285715
8401346,1,B003NWQ0LU,"I knew this was a bootleg copy of the film when I got it but usually their good quality. This one is TERRIBLE!!!

The video is very very dark making it harder to see. You can see blocks all over the video and it blurs like a screwed up VHS tape every once in a while.

This isn't even worth paying for in my opinion. Had the video quality been better, or at least a little more watchable then I would have been satisfied but believe me, you will more then likely regret the purchase of this item unless your very desperate to watch this at a terrible quality that looks way worse than VHS did.",1325289600,14,593,4.103448275862069
8401347,1,B003NWQ0LU,"As the other review stated, there is no film titled ""Coonskin 2"". This product is an illegal dvd of Bakshi's film ""Hey Good Lookin'"". I can't believe amazon allows this to be sold on their site. That being said, this is a great film. Hold out for an official release if you can. DEFINITELY check out ""Coonskin"". That is an AMAZING film!",1320364800,21,336,4.435483870967742
8401348,3,B003NWQ0LU,"I repeat: There is no such film as ""Coonskin 2.""

This is a pirated DVD copy of the 1982 Ralph Bakshi film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hey-Good-Lookin/dp/B00BWQTUTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hey Good Lookin'</a>.""

It is pirated from the VHS videotape release that came out 20 years (or so) ago.

The real film was finally released on DVD in 2013 from Warner Archives. It is a commercially produced DVD-R, which is better than this, and better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick!",1287619200,47,530,5.6
