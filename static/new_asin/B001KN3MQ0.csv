8315408,5,B001KN3MQ0,"The Chen 18-movement Tai Chi is divided into sections of 4 or 5 moves.  For each move, there is a demo, then an instruction about the essential parts and then what I like best is that the move is repeated several times for practicing with lettering reminding you of essential parts (like ""weight shift to the right"").  The repetition means I don't have to keep rewinding to work on the move several times.  The demos and move practice are shot with simultaneous front and back -- I move with the part shot from the back, but can look at the front part to see how hands are held.  I find it easy to see weight shifts and hand movements because Sean does his movements with significant bent knees, but makes it clear in the video that the amount you bend your knees is up to you. I am 70yo and just starting Tai Ji so there is no way I could be as low as he is or step as wide as he does, but that makes it easy for me to see foot placement and shifting of weight and body turning.  Each Section also includes a full review of all the moves in sequence in that section as well.",1475452800,,1075,4.1
8315409,3,B001KN3MQ0,The movements are too quick I keep having to rewind and review.  The yellow directions move too fast and the yellow lettering is hard to see over green bushes and water background.,1267488000,,180,4.625
8315410,4,B001KN3MQ0,"This is the best DVD ever.  With different views on how to perfect the moves, it was easy to learn and retain.",1252800000,,110,4.0
8315411,5,B001KN3MQ0,This is the best instructional video I've used. The explanation of details in each movement and the mirror-image presentation of the movements make it possible for even a beginning student to master the steps.,1252800000,,209,5.176470588235294
8315412,5,B001KN3MQ0,I am an on and off user of this form of Taiji and this video with its split screen showing front and back views plus slow motion is an excellent way to refresh ones memory and correct mistakes. This is the best video I've seen on this form. I don't think anyone who purchases this DVD will be disappointed. Keith,1247270400,2,312,4.216666666666667
8315413,5,B001KN3MQ0,"This DVD is very well made and shows detailed movements in real time as well as in slow motion with front and back views.  The instructor  provides a good visual model and also verbal descriptions of each movement.  The DVD includes warm up exercises and silk reeling practice which are very helpful to all levels of training.  If you are a new student to tai chi or one who has studied for a while, you can benefit from this excellent video. Easy to navigate the index and segments during practice  also.  Definitely worth having!",1226707200,4,531,4.595744680851064
8315414,5,B001KN3MQ0,"As a newcomer to Taiji, I needed a serious training aid to help me learn the moves.  This video did the trick.  The instructor provides a methodical stepwise explanation of each move that is broken down into parts to aid the learning process.  The moves can be watched individually or in series when you are ready to transition to the next move.  You can watch the instructor head on or facing away as needed to enhance the learning experience.  I don't think you can find a better training device for Taiji anywhere.",1226534400,4,517,4.576086956521739
