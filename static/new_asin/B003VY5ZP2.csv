8407182,2,B003VY5ZP2,"There is no focused lesson plan.  The instructor seems to just draw randomly and mention whatever comes to mind.  Also, he draws everything on one page, and some are images are drawn so small that you lose what he's trying to illustrate.  At the expensive price that I paid for this DVD, the artist could have drawn one illustration per page and shown things more clearly.  Yes, there is value in some of the things he teaches, but you have to sit through a bunch of fluff to get to it.  The DVD is overpriced for what you get.",1399939200,,527,4.282828282828283
8407183,4,B003VY5ZP2,David move a bit fast on this dvd its somewhat difficult to follow but wonderful technique and instruction just be ready to pause a bit if you are following along.  With that being said this dvd is a great addition to any artists library.,1395014400,,238,4.409090909090909
8407184,5,B003VY5ZP2,If anyone who struggles to draw hands in the awe so many thousand of ways to draw them and really don't know how to get started on drawing believable hand drawings I would seriously recommend this DVD for you. Even if you struggle just drawing feet correctly and proportionally as well. This artist David Finch who is well know in the comic book world and movies really breaks down how to draw hands and feet and gives some amazing tips on how to draw them as well.  He goes into detail how to start a hand drawing for male and female and tells you how to make them look great.  The best way for a artist to learn how to draw something better is to see another artist draw it amazingly and that is exactly what David Finch does.,1373328000,,728,4.23021582733813
8407185,5,B003VY5ZP2,"College is very expensive.  I'm still paying off my masters degree.  These DVDs that Ian did along with some of the others in the Gnomon series offer all the informatio I got in college and more in some cases.  They don't teach you about the business end of illustration but really you just need names of art directors, post cards, stamps and some base contracts of your own if you are working with shifty small companies.  Either way this DVD is a must have.",1341273600,,459,4.428571428571429
8407186,5,B003VY5ZP2,"Although this is the second video in the series, I purchased it last because the other two were areas I wanted to practice in first. Once again David finch has not disappointed me. This video is a little shorter than the other two( coming in at an hour and forty minutes). The first two thirds of the video is all about the hands. The feet are covered in the last third. David draws the hands in a variety of poses and angles. He draws them as fists, pointing toward the viewer, away from the viewer, flexed as if reaching for something or dropping something. He demonstrates how light falls on the hand. David also shows the differences in the male and female hand. He even gives you some clawed hands to demonstrate how they are still drawn basically the same way.
  In the short section on the feet, David shows his own quick way to lay out the under drawing for the feet which totally simplfies how to begin. He draws the feet in shoes more than he does bare due to the fact that in comics you will rarely draw them bare. He draws the underside of the foot only once stating that in all his years drawing comics he's only drawn the underside a few times.
  All in all this is a great dvd. The hand is so expressive that it can be very difficult to draw and the vast number of examples given by David really will help you get a feel for the hand and how to draw it. I have been pleaed with this entire video series. David Finch is a wonderful artist and an excellent instructor. Anyone who loves to draw for fun or for a profession would definitely benefit from this series.",1298419200,3,1577,4.264214046822742
