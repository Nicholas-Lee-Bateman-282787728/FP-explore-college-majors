4164306,4,B003PAXOL4,"I wanted to see this movie because of Rob Pattinson.  I knew he was not the main character so I wasn't surprised by that.  I was, however surprised by how wonderful this little film is.  It is a warm, loving story of a family.  It is beautifully acted and creatively filmed.  I enjoyed the story & I really felt for the characters.  It is very British & tough to understand the dialogue sometimes, but that just added to, not distracted from.  A movie that makes me laugh, cry & look forward to seeing it again deserves 4 stars.",1285545600,15,528,4.326530612244898

4164309,5,B003PAXOL4,"Like most of the viewers, I watched this movie because of Robert Pattinson (he didn't have a major role). Anyway, I was very surprised of how much I liked the movie. Giving it a 5 star because of Catherine Tate's performance, along with the daughter, and grandmother. It's about family, what's important in life, discovery, the ups and down of being a young mother.  It's touching! Only bad thing, it was too short. Overall, worth watching.",1284249600,5,440,4.7894736842105265
4164310,5,B003PAXOL4,"This made for TV movie was based on the best-selling novel: The Bad Mother's Handbook by Kate Long.

Like most people purchasing this DVD, I bought it because Robert Pattinson played a character in it. And I admit, I had low expectations of enjoying anything more than his appearance in it. Of course, that is WHY they are marketing this movie the way they are.

What I was NOT expecting was to see so LITTLE of Rob and yet to enjoy this movie so much. This is a very moving, funny, thought-provoking film. I LOVED the glimpses of Rob... he is so young and plays awkward SO well. Adorable. But I was not disappointed, even though I would have enjoyed seeing more of him, because the Bad Mother's Handbook is just that GOOD.

The story is about a dysfunctional, multigenerational family of women. Middle-aged Karen is stressed and frustrated, struggling to care for both a teenage daughter and mother with Alzheimer's. She has a bit of an identity crisis when she discovers a long-kept secret. Her bright but hormonal daughter, Charlotte, has her own crisis when she discovers that she's pregnant about the same time her dead-beat boyfriend dumps her. Enter Daniel (Robert Pattinson), a new student and doctor's son, who tries to support her in his own nerdy way. Karen strikes out at both her mother and daughter in bitter disappointment, but all the turmoil serves to teach them all some important lessons about love, family, and being a mother. I laughed and had tears...

My advice - if you think this movie stars Rob, lower your expectations and you'll be better able to enjoy a very good movie.

HINT: If you aren't used to HEAVY British/Scottish accents, you might want to turn on the English SUBTITLES. I did and it made all the difference.",1283817600,41,1747,4.696078431372549
4164311,2,B003PAXOL4,"The cover may advertise Rob Pattinson (from the Twilight Saga), but he's hardly in it. The movie is really dull, and at times boring. The movie is just about how Charlie & her mother don't get along and that Charlie's mom is adopted. the movie isn't too good. It's a total Made for TV movie, but this movie isn't really worth watching. It's really short (69mins) and the credits are 30seconds long so yeah. The movie is something you'd see on LifeTime or something. If your a Twilight Fan, then you'll love, if not then just skip it.",1283731200,,533,4.448979591836735
4164312,3,B003PAXOL4,"While this film is not bad, for a made for TV flick, it is a complete injustice to bill it as a ""Robert Pattinson film:. The story is about Charlie, and her relationship with her mother and grandmother. Daniel Gale is an ancillary character at best. This is nothing short of opportunistic advertising, and marketing making the assumption that the public doesn't know better.",1282262400,31,374,4.859375

4164321,1,B003PAXOL4,"I actually watched this on the Encore movie channel so thank God I didn't buy this! Anyway, I was first attracted to this because Robert Pattinson was in it with his British accent and it sorta sounded interesting. Plus the fact I was SUPER bored, so I thought what the heck.

Man, what a big waste of my time! So the girl pretty much is a slut and, well, white British trash. I'm not dissing the British or white people(since I'm white) so don't call me racist! Second, I couldn't really understand a WORD they were saying! They weren't like the Harry Potter actors where they actually try to pronounce their words enough for people to understand while these people sounded like they were talking jibberish the entire movie! The only person I actually understood was Rob.

Anyway, this is a movie you'd look up on Youtube just see it when you're bored. Other than that, don't even bother watching it. Knit, read, sleep, eat, do ANYTHING that doesn't have anything to do with watching this movie! You've been warned.",1373155200,,1016,4.638888888888889

4164327,3,B003PAXOL4,I bought this movie because of Rob Pattinson being in it.  Its kind of an endearing movie where his character gets involved with a girl who is pregnant by another and he gets himself involved with her and her dysfunctional family.  It works out in the end.,1361664000,,256,4.425531914893617
4164328,4,B003PAXOL4,"As others have said, this movie is not centered around Rob Pattinson, whose face you can barely see even when he does appear due to his voluminous bangs.  But, his character does play an important part in the drama being played out and ,if you can understand the British accents, it's an interesting family drama.  I especially appreciated the ending twist. (No spoilers).  Strong womean dominate this pic and, all in all, I enjoyed it.  Catherine Tate is great as a frustrated mother who needs to come to terms with what she's been dealt by life.  A bit different from her comedic fare on British TV and on latter seasons of ""The Office.""",1358380800,,639,4.619469026548672
4164329,5,B003PAXOL4,"The shipping was fast and this movie is a great movie if you like British comedy. However, it is a little bit juvenile. Still loved the acting and the story plot.",1357084800,,162,4.258064516129032

4164332,4,B003PAXOL4,"Okay, I get that this movie is the equivalent of ""made for TV"" here in the U.S.  I get that it's kind of ""fluffy"", dealing with heavy themes (adoption, unplanned pregnancy, family secrets) with a big dose of sardonic humor.  I've never read the book, either.  I'll admit that I bought the movie because Robert Pattinson was in it and I was curious about his early acting roles. I didn't expect much.  What I found was a cute, somewhat heartwarming little film about family ties, VERY British, with likeable characters.  Rob's only in it somewhat (which I expected) and it's obvious he's at the beginning of his career--although he has some great moments with his portrayal of awkward, socially-inept Daniel.  Holly (these days she's Holiday) Granger is also fun to watch and other actors are adequate (although there are one or two stereotypes which were played a bit too camp for me).  Still, I've watched this several times, usually when I just want something light-hearted.  Fun little movie!

On a side note, Robert and Holiday appear together in the recent film Bel Ami. Interesting to see their progression as actors a few years later.",1349827200,,1141,4.84020618556701
4164333,5,B003PAXOL4,"I absolutely ADORED this movie!  Sign me admittedly guilty of buying this DVD only because of the RPattz factor. However, this movie turned out to have a much more substantial storyline than I initially expected.  It was refreshing, compelling,and endearing with a twist of humor.  The dynamics of the grandmother, mother, and daughter relationships were thought provoking.  The storyline gives you much to consider and want to discuss later.  I never would have expected this high caliber from a supposed B teen angst movie.  However, a disconnect for me was they didn't show how the other students, faculty or neighbors, etc. reacted towards a pregnant teen in British society.  I would have appreciated seeing those struggles.  Charlotte's pregnancy came across as unrealistically commonplace and acceptable minus any hardships, ostracism, repercussions, etc.; whereas the rest of the movie was so painfully realistic at times that I was moved to tears.  There wasn't a message for teens not to get pregnant here.  I found the meaning was more directed towards women, their relationships and honesty.  Nonetheless, I liked the film very much. It was entertaining and left you wanting to know more.  I thought all the actors even down to the saucy ex-husband did a convincing impressive portrayal.  As far as the RPattz factor, I thought he was amazing and did one of his best performances as the awkward geek.  Frankly, he stole every scene with his warm humor and gentle approach although he was only in a handful of scenes (still worth buying the DVD though for fans!).  He had a natural ease in his acting delivery then, which I think he should get back to in the films he's doing now.  I'd highly recommend this movie for RPattz fans, pregnant teens and people looking for their birth mothers - not sure who else would find this film as amusing as I did!  I plan to watch it over and over again. Hope you enjoy, too!",1348963200,,1923,4.867692307692308
4164334,4,B003PAXOL4,"I just grabbed this book off of the shelf and I was surprised that I liked this as much as I did. It was three generations in one house and they had a lot of issues. This was a great read and I loved it.

Here is what I didn't care for: the book is written in by all 3 woman's point of view, which is fine, but they don't tell you who it is.... You have to figure it out. It wouldn't have been that bad, but in one chapter you could be in someone's head 6 different times... and it is a lot to figure out.

Other then that I really liked this book. I may be looking into other books that this author has written. I would recommend this book.

On the Back Cover:

For seventeen-year old Charlotte Cooper, it's too late. Despite her best efforts to finish school, tune out her angry, slightly hysterical mother, and cope with her loving but dotty grandmother, she is unexpectedly (now, that's an understatement) pregnant. And don't even mention the jerk who knocked her up.

Charlotte's mother, Karen, is trying to convince herself that there are worse things than becoming a grandmother at thirty-three. For instance, there's wanting to kill Charlotte for the mess she's made of her life. Between struggling to pay the bills and halfheartedly filling out questionnaires on Internet dating sites, Karen uncovers a scandalous family secret involving her own birth, an dthen falls back into bed with her sexy ex-husband. So much for perfect timing.

In the meantime, Karen's mother, Nan, is having a wee bit of trouble with names (sometimes her own). But that doesn't keep her from retaining a few things she'd rather forget. Of course, Nan knows that everything will work out fine for Charlotte and the baby - these things usually do. Now, if only she could put the pieces of her own fragmented memory together, she might have an interesting tale or two to share.",1340150400,,1860,4.553892215568863
4164335,4,B003PAXOL4,If you buy this because Robert Pattinson is in it you may be disappointed as he is definitely not playing a sexy romantic character.  And you better enjoy British humor as it's very different.  What I found is that Pattinson is a very diversified actor who can realistically portray many types of characters.  Watch his acting in this as a nerdy fellow - it's quite believable.  I just wish there was more of him in the movie.,1339372800,,426,4.4935064935064934
4164336,5,B003PAXOL4,I love this movie! I received it faster than I expected and in the best condition. I expected mediocre because of the price but it was well worth the purchase!,1332460800,,159,4.333333333333333
4164337,4,B003PAXOL4,"I do not think of Catherine Tate as a tender, sensitive actor, but that is what you get in this film.  Tate's comedy usually isn't my taste, but this was a sweet surprise and you do get some of her acerbic style.

The DVD cover features Robert Pattinson who plays a small role. I read that he doesn't consider himself a comedy actor, but he is very funny and endearing as Daniel.

I was actually hadn't considered this DVD until I read some of the other comments.  It turned out to be quite enjoyable.",1332201600,3,501,4.297872340425532
4164338,5,B003PAXOL4,"The family dynamic is very great in this film... but the main thing that caught my attention was Robert Pattinson's performance. Most people by now know him as the embodiment of Stephanie Meyer's utterly enchanting and practically flawless vampire, Edward Cullen. Which, is what makes this performance all the more intriguing because here, he plays the antithesis of that character. As Daniel Gale, he is the shy, bumbling, sweet-hearted boy who you can't help but sympathize with as he is thrust into the bedlam that is life and love with a pregnant teen. You can't help but love his character and the level of realness he brings to it.",1330905600,,637,4.853211009174312
4164339,4,B003PAXOL4,"Although Rob Pattinson is in this movie and does a rather good job with his part.  This

really about the mother and daughter.

4164340,3,B003PAXOL4,"The movie was marketed after Mr. Pattinson hit it big with the tweens in Twilight and they knew they could make a buck putting this on DVD. I was disappointed to see that while watching a DVD the ""F"" word was actually BLEEPED out. Really? BLEEPED on a DVD? It was only used once in the film, and the ""S"" word is never bleeped on British TV, but I was disappointed in that.  I also felt like it was cut up a bit from the original, but it's still likable.

The book is far better, but the movie did it justice.",1315267200,,508,4.01980198019802

Definitely shouldn't be advertised the way it is, the story line has very little to do with Rob.  The film is worth watching :)",1306540800,,348,4.421875
4164346,4,B003PAXOL4,"This movie isn't 'face' time for Robert Pattinson so if that's what your hoping for then you maybe a bit disappointed not that he's not throughout the movie but the focus is actually on the 3 women in the film, mainly Catherine Tate.  It's about mother-daughter relationships (all kinds). It's a wonderful film for me because I enjoy the actors presented and I think the film was well shot, and the movie was one that I enjoy. I won't give away the details but I will say it can be a movie that can make you laugh and cry, if you're into it.",1306454400,2,541,4.252427184466019

8401919,5,B003PAXOL4,"What a wonderful, endearing film. So well acted and authentically portrayed. Women of all ages will recognize themselves here along with the struggles we all face with whom we choose, or don't choose, and the paths our lives may take based on a decision that sometimes doesn't really seem like it's in our hands. Struggles with our multiple roles as lovers, mothers and children, and learning to value the men in our lives who don't see us as irrelevant (which is how we so often view ourselves) affects so many of us and is dealt with here in humor and a forthrightness that I found quite refreshing.
