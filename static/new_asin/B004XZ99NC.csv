8447762,5,B004XZ99NC,"The camera isn't really out of focus.  But did something to try and make it all look pixelated, like kind of like a video game.  There is this overlay, like you're looking at her through a screen door, or glass that has cross stitched reinforcement or something.

So yeah, I think that's what they must have been going for:  trying to make it look like Coco (the gravure model) is in a video game.

Once you get past that, this film is basically just a really long gravure shoot.  She just dances around provocatively in bare nothing (but not quite showing everything).

The model looks pretty good, although not exactly a look-alike to Catherine from the game.  She's clearly Japanese.  Has curves in all the right places.  Slim waist.  Cut blond curls.  Dark blue eyes (perhaps using blue contacts?  Not sure.)

So if you're the kind of person who likes watching Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue videos, this is along those lines.  Not much plot.  A few guys talk in narration (but you don't see them on screen), about meeting Catherine while she's doing what she does.",1505606400,,1072,4.682795698924731

8447765,5,B004XZ99NC,"If you are looking for a porn, this isn't one. It is erotica. It has only one actress and no dialog. It does have a story - but the story is not in your face obvious and is very much open to interpretation. Considering the subject of this film that is a good thing. This movie is very different things to different people - why would it be any other way?",1420070400,2,354,4.0

8447767,1,B004XZ99NC,"This film is just erotic, like watching a sports illustrated swimsuit video, no story just erotic poses. Not exactly what I thought it was.",1355529600,30,139,4.833333333333333
8447768,2,B004XZ99NC,"I really wish I had skipped this Bluray, but I am a sort of collector and thought this would be a good addition to the videogame, I almost felt forced to buy this. I love the game but this video just has the name Catherine on it to tag along the success of the videogame. I think the main reason this video has ugly filters all through out is the model, they should have gone with someone younger and prettier, I mean she looks incredible on the cover but look at unedited video or photos and you can clearly see why the movie is a filtered mess. The video almost looks like it was shot with an old potato. To add insult to injury, that cute dress on the cover is not even featured in the video. I can't imagine why this video was delayed so much, maybe the editor couldn't make up his mind on what ugly filters would be applied to the video. If cosplay is what you want, you would be better off importing cosplay dvd videos straight from Japan.

There is one good thing on this video though, the song at the intro. It really fits the Catherine world. In closing, this was the first time that I've purchased a ""Happy Chicken"" release and also the last.",1350518400,26,1152,4.212669683257919
