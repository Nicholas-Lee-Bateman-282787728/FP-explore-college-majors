760057,4,6303995713,"This 1990 film by writer-director Whit Stillman is wonderfully refreshing and intelligent.  It is sure to please audiences with a taste for the avant-garde or those just looking for something a little different.
The  story follows a group of upper-crust New York preppies during the Christmas  debutante season.  These are kids for whom black-tie balls at the Plaza  Hotel and charming little soirees in Park Avenue apartments are serious  matters.  They are the UHB-""urban haute bourgeoisie""-a social  circle carrying out traditions so anachronistic as to seem alien;  traditions, in fact, which were outdated before these characters were even  born.
A middle class outsider and budding socialist named Tom Townsend  (Edward Clements) happens into this elite group and briefly livens things  up.  He shocks them with his leftist rhetoric (he is a devotee of Fourier)  and anti-deb outlook, but they nonetheless find themselves drawn to him.  Tom finds a kindred spirit in the cynically fatalistic Nick (Christopher  Eigeman).  Nick is the most self-aware member of the inner circle and he  provides comic relief with his devastating ongoing critique of their lives  and behavior.
Stillman's characters seem to have everything going for  them.  They are bright and educated and come from very wealthy families.  We learn, though, that privilege is both their blessing and their curse.  These children of status are destined to always remain in the shadow of  their very successful parents.  As one of them puts it, ""We're doomed  to failure.""  We come to realize that even though they are well-off in  many ways, they still must struggle with the same insecurities and fears as  the rest of us.
The characters in ""Metropolitan"" are the kind  of people that F. Scott Fitzgerald knew so well.  Indeed, if Fitzgerald had  been a director rather than a writer, this is the type of film he might  have made.  It is intelligent and literate with dialogue that almost  crackles with its liveliness and wit.  ""Metropolitan"" gives us a  rare glimpse into a world that scarcely exists anymore, if it ever really  did.  It is a real treasure.",961027200,60,2131,5.084302325581396

Is it an independent film sure, but is it a campy film?  By no means.  This is a very dialogue  oriented film, but unlike Ivory Merchant films, the dialogue is witty and  enjoyable.  In reality, this film could easily be a play, and that is  saying quite a lot.  The plot has been explained earlier, so I won't waste  your time.  Is this movie good?  Yes.  Should you own it?

A group of young people talk rather than curse, flirt and banter instead of bonking like crazed rabbits in a  Viagra test programme, & live in a world where romance could just  depend on your attitude toward Jane Austen. The script is rich and subtle,  well-delivered by a cast of unknowns, manage to convey the deep insecurity  beneath a superficial sophistication.  The understated style and low-budget  production values won't appeal to devotees of Scorsese/Oliver Stone-style  flash.  But don't write director Whit Stillman off as a ""preppie Woody  Allen"".

But I also enjoyed  all the literary references and Stillman's injection of perhaps his own  upbringing: Steiff bears, Brooks Brothers, Thorstein Veblen, Farmington  debutantes, etc.  It's not something I grew up with but watching this film  I learned something other than what I grew up in.  And yes, there is a hint  of romance.  But it's very well done.  Not at all over the top.

760198,4,6303995713,"This is a well-made and well-acted movie, Whit Stillman's first, from 1990, and featuring a group of actors who were not, and still are not, well-known.  And yet one can't help but wonder: who's the audience?  I ask the question fully aware that one can't dictate what directors should or should not make movies about; it's just that this one is about such a relatively tiny social group and it's written in such a highly literate allusive manner that it's hard to see it being appealing to anyone except fairly well-off humanities majors with degrees from liberal-arts colleges.  Okay -- maybe I exaggerate a bit, but still -- it's hard to see many people caring or being even particularly interested in immature, socially privileged college freshmen and high school seniors.  I'm tempted to say that the movie seems to have been made for people like the characters in the movie ten years on, who can see it, recognize themselves in it, laugh ruefully, and say, ""God, weren't we full of it!""

I think Whit Stillman, who wrote as well as directed, knows this.  The Jane Austen fixation of his most sympathetic character, Audrey (Carolyn Farina), bespeaks an interest in the dynamics of small, fairly privileged social groups, and, of course, Austen's readers came from these very groups, who represented the literate novel-reading public of the time.  But film, especially nowadays, appeals to a much broader demographic, so Stillman's choice of subject seems deliberately self-limiting to a degree that Austen would never have recognized.  Standing over against Audrey in the movie are Tom (Edward Clements) and Charlie (Taylor Nichols) -- both in their respective ways social theorists (Tom considers himself a ""Fourierist""!) who speak about society and its woes in a completely abstract way.  They have no experience of what life is like in any stratum but their own, and it's telling that Tom, the ""poorest"" of the group, is financially less secure than the others only because his rich dad had divorced and is holding him at arm's length.  But Tom has gone to the same private schools as the others and can still contemplate a trip to France.  He's by no means on his uppers.

The young women in the movie are ""debs"" -- girls from wealthy families who are making their appearance in ""society"" at deb balls that require escorts from the same social stratum -- and these escorts are the young men.  They have lines of patter -- like Tom's and Charlie's ""philosophy"" or Nick's pseudo-cynicism -- that make them seem superficially more sophisticated than the young women, whose talk is more limited to gossip and sexual innuendo, but they don't really have things together any more than the girls do.  All realize that their parents are ""successful"" but they have no certainty about their own success in life or what might constitute it.  And, of course, there's no reason why they should have at age 19 -- but they worry about it.  The touching thing about the movie is that the group (they call themselves the ""Sally Fowler Rat Pack,"" after the girl in whose apartment they meet after the balls to talk things over) is basically a bunch of quite likeable kids.  The baneful presences of exploitive male and female sexual challenges -- the slimy Rick von Sloneker (Will Kempe) and the promiscuous and manipulative Serena Slocum ( Ellia Thompson) -- stand outside the group, impinging on it more frequently as topics of discussion than in person, though the plot concerns the degree to which these baneful influences can be resisted.  The details of how this is managed -- I won't give ""spoiler"" details -- are both poignant and humorous, and one might think that by the end some of the characters at least have learned that some of their fears and concerns have been a bit idiotic.  The final images of Tom, Chris, and Audrey hitch-hiking back to the city are at least a breath of fresh air in a movie full, up to that point, of interiors almost claustrophobically tight or cluttered.

Stillman shot the movie on a very low budget, and given his aims, it's hard to see that he put a foot wrong.  I think the movie succeeds on its own terms, but they're a bit limited.  We're really invited to feel superior to the characters -- more mature, more pragmatic, less anxious.  The genre combines comedy of manners with satire directed, quite gently, more at immaturity than at any social evil that needs to be remedied.  You can't dislike the movie, though, any more than you can dislike your younger self.",1437696000,,4503,4.810635538261997

A young middle class man gets accidently swept up into a circle of upper class friends after supposedly sharing his taxi on a cold night after a dance. Through the interchanges that follow, a great deal is learnt about literature, life, and love and each of the characters' lives are changed.

This movie is not your typical teen movie. Though there isn't much action, the movie is full of character and is fueled by the witty, informative, and thought-provoking dialogue that pours from each character. However, unlike many of the 1970s dialogue-heavy films, METROPOLITAN doesn't become boring. Instead, it moves the audience from one interchange to the next, revealing more and more about the characters with each scene of dialogue.

I also felt that the script would make a better play than a movie. However, if you're looking for an intelligent, charming film, METROPOLITAN maybe for you.",1402790400,,978,5.068322981366459

760383,4,6303995713,"Metropolitan is an entertaining, but emotionally distant, film about young Manhattan socialites, who define themselves not as ""preppys"" but as the bourgeois youth. The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the setting is a timeless New York that sometimes looks like the late 1980s but could really be anytime.

We are presented with a fresh storyline, of sophisticated young adults doing and saying whatever they please. They operate within a kind of legitimate dishonesty; one character considers himself a scholar of literature despite having only read literary criticisms rather than the texts themselves, and another justifies his slander as having a ""factual basis.""

The warped vision of morality these characters have is even more striking by how easily we the audience fall into it; in one scene, the excellent and sharp-witted character Tom is confronted for the lies he has spread about his social rival Rick, and we are (or, at least, I was) on his side; for all the manipulation Tom has conducted throughout the film, we shared in that juicy gossip and are just as guilty to be caught in his trap.

In addition to giving us fun dialogue and scenarios, the narrative moves in a believable and logical fashion, despite the somewhat hyperbolic nature of the characters. The group of friends feels tight for a few glorious days, but in the film's second half, it disintegrates organically, as the ""honeymoon"" period ends and each follows his or her individual pursuits.

My one disappointment with this film is the lack of emotional engagement; I am a sucker for coming-of-age films and films about witty, sophisticated youth, so the fact that there was no emotional connection sets a ceiling for this film, in my book at least. Metropolitan is a very entertaining, believable, though a not exactly hard-hitting black comedy.",1369440000,,1829,5.0664451827242525

I'm impressed with the talent that went to this project; the acting, directing, the filming is all excellent; but somehow I don't really like any of the people.  That is a deal-breaker for me, because when I watch a movie, I start out with, ""OK, who am I this time?""  I have to identify with someone.  Or several someones.  I didn't want to identify with anyone in this movie.  A personal quirk of mine?  The screenplay was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards.  Personally, and this is just me, I dislike the screenplay, the structure for the entire movie.  Or maybe it's the debutante society that just doesn't work for me as entertainment.

Enui.

That is the word I would use to sum up my reaction to this movie.  It might even be the screenplay's theme.  Light-weight people going through the motions to relieve boredom who have already abandoned their lives as meaningless.  One scene in a bar sticks to my mind, where a guy who is making good money in a job and career he detests, complains about meeting former peers who are now orders of magnitude above him in success, and it just leaves him weak and devastated, knowing he can never catch up.  As a slice of New York City life it may be deadly accurate, but I just want to say, ""Oh, grow a pair.""

760385,5,6303995713,"I am watching this film again. It certainly repays more than one viewing.

To be honest, the appearance and character of Audrey Rouget (played by Carolyn Farina) is what leads me to view this film especially favourably. But the whole film is intriguing. The dialogue is funny, but the odd editing and the sly way in which Stillman's witty points slip so facilely out of his youthful characters' mouths seem to work together to underplay the brilliance of the script.

Audrey says something like, ""life is pretty melodramatic if you look at it as a whole"". There is a sense of impending tragedy amongst all the wit, beauty, charm and wealth on display. There are few greater burdens than youthful promise.

The biggest puzzle for me is Audrey's level of self-awareness and how much she is manipulating the situation. (A point raised by a previous reviewer.) Is she cleverer than the viewer may realise? Or is the cleverness mostly the director's, as when he has his young people sit at a dinner party and discuss a film in which people sit at a dinner party that is really on a stage (The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie). Stillman really piles on the irony thick, and there is a certain unreality about the entire scenario, as if the characters know they are being observed. But I think his primary interest is clear enough: success and failure; as befits a man who has had his share of both.

This film really fascinates me, and I have written about it several times at my blog. This was the main discussion, on its sexual politics:
[...]

I suspect there is a major clue hidden in plain sight. What does Audrey do all through the film, besides look deucedly pretty? She reads Austen, as a general planning a campaign would read a book of strategy. Are all the characters dancing to her tune?

I saw the film when it was originally in theaters and recently viewed this release on disc. It has all weathered reasonably well, though I admit I was perhaps less than enamored the second time around. This is a fine ensemble effort, spiced with quiet but noticeable ironies and eccentricities, a kind of high school attempt at a Noel Coward comedy of manners that eventually serves up a plot line of sorts. The first time I saw it I thought that it ended with an inconclusive whimper, a view that I still hold. It's really my only serious criticism of the film. Up until then, it's a winsome ride with a collection of pretentious but likable youngsters, and if one is inclined to scoff or dismiss it all, keep in mind that they're all just kids.",1352678400,,948,4.751515151515152
760390,5,6303995713,"Whit Stillman's singular wit is on fine display in Metropolitan, his first and perhaps most famous film. Some viewers might not want to follow upper crust (or ""UC,"" as one character says) New Yorkers who dine, dance, and complain about their privilege. Others will delight in their alternately ridiculous and thought-provoking dialogue.

One Christmas vacation, Tom Townsend (Edward Clements) stumbles into a crowd of socialites. He knows several of them, but his situation is decidedly middle class. Tom claims he doesn't approve of their decadent balls, yet night after night he partakes in their soirees and late night discussions

These youths are prone to hyperbole and contradiction. One calls Tom ""the phony of the decade,"" while another calls a peer ""one of the worst guys of modern times."" They don't think twice about dismissing Charles Fourier's utopian socialism. Initially obnoxious, their pretension becomes increasingly amusing and even poignant as they try to justify their existence. The awkward Charlie Black (Taylor Nichols) breathlessly goes on about how their class is doomed. They have nowhere to go but down. What else are they to do but enjoy themselves and philosophize?

Along with the conflicted Tom and confusing Charlie, this group includes Cynthia McLean (Isabel Gillies), the ""slut,"" Audrey Rouget (Carolyn Farina), the book lover, and the often passed-out Fred Nuff (Bryan Leder. They usually gather at homes of the sophisticated Sally Fowler (Dylan Hundley) or imperious Jane Clark (Allison Parisi).

The most memorable individual is Nick Smith, played by Christopher Eigeman. Like an Oscar Wilde character but with more conviction, Nick revels in defending the status quo and has an opinion on everything. Hypocritical, wise, passionate, dishonest--Tom says, ""he's basically a nice guy, I think."" Others believe Nick ""could be really crazy."" He vilifies the titled Rick Von Sloneker (Will Kempe), his apparent nemesis. Is this slander, or is Nick just more observant than the others? Nick might drive his friends crazy, but in a moment of crisis (real or imagined), they note that Nick ""would know what to do.""

There are moments of pathos. Several characters harbor painful crushes, and both Nick and Tom come from ""broken homes."" Nick uses humor to describe his step-mother's malice, while Tom is in denial of his father's indifference.

The cinematography is simple, and the music is appropriately whimsical. Because there is no plot, Stillman's films can feel interminable. Eigeman is always spot on, but some of the young actors, most of them appearing in film for the first time, are rather wooden and awkward.

Still, this window into the lives of the self-absorbed and youthful rich contains great humor. While their manner of speaking may be unrecognizable to most audiences, these people are surprising in a way fictional characters rarely are. Only comparable to other Stillman personalities, Nick is a unique figure in cinema, as is Whit Stillman himself.",1347840000,,3001,5.3052631578947365

I thought I'd take a look again on this Criterion transfer.  Director/writer Whit Stillman who later did ""The Last Days of Disco"" is obviously a filmmaker focused on dialog and what dialog it is.

The story revolves around a group of Park Avenue socialites not quite in their 20's and their routine of attending debutante parties and then retiring to one of the parents apartments and talking all night.  Who knew this lifestyle even existed?  This is about as foreign to me as Borneo.  Stillman infuses these decadent but somehow likeable characters with snappy, almost British proper dialog.  You would almost think you are seeing a Jane Austin story.  In fact, she is referenced often.  Perhaps that's why I like it.  It plays like a 19th century British film, but with a bunch of unknown actors in the Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson roles.  I find it interesting as well, that I've never heard of any of the actors, then or now.  Nice film.",1332720000,,1104,4.571428571428571

760460,5,6303995713,"Back in 1984, Whit Stillman began work on his screenplay for ""Metropolitan"", a screenplay that would be completed in 1988.  At the time, Stillman ran his own illustration agency but in order to get his screenplay created for the big screen, Stillman sold his apartment in New York for $50,000 and whatever money friends and family could contribute to his project.

""Metropolitan"" is loosely based on Stillman's experience while attending his first year at Harvard and while living with his divorced mother during the week of Christmas break.  The film focuses on a small group of preps who live in Upper East Side Manhattan and attending the debutante balls during their first year of college.  The term ""Urban Haute Bourgeoisie"" was coined from this film and while many people would consider the film about WASP-students, ironically Stillman's grandfather E. Digby Baltzell was responsible for coining the term WASP.

The film featured intellectual dialogue reminiscent of French New Wave director Eric Rohmer and the film would go on to receive an Academy Award nomination back in 1991 for ""Best Original Screenplay"", a nomination for Grand Jury Prize (Drama) at the 1990 Sundance Film Festival and winning ""Best New Director"" at the New York Film Critics Circle Award in 1990.

""Metropolitan"" is a film that revolves around a group of Upper East Side Manhattanites who are preparing for a party at Sally Fowler's.  Princeton student Tom Townsend (played by Edward Clements) is trying to catch a cab in which the group (known as the Sally Fowler Rat Pack) is also trying to catch.  Because Tom allows them to take the cab, Nick Smith (played by Chris Eigeman) invites Tom to join them for their party.

We are introduced to a group of individuals who love to discuss socio-economics, literary discussions, politics and the life of young adults.  Tom who is an intellectual himself meets the rat pack leader Nick (who becomes a good friend of Tom and allows him to be part of their circle); the blonde singer Sally Fowler (played by Dylan Hundley); the often-drunk and always sleeping Fred Neff (played by Bryan Leder); the very opinionated Jane Clark (played by Allison Rutledge); the sexy Cynthia McLean (played by Isabel Gillies); the bespectacled and often-opinionated Charlie Black (played by Taylor Nichols) and the sensitive, literary loving Audrey Rouget (played by Carolyn Farina).

After the party is over, it is revealed that unlike his new friends, Tom doesn't live in the Upper East Side.  He and his mother try to live with whatever money they have and despite going to a nice college, he tries to conceal his lack of finances by renting tuxedo's and thus he is seen as a man who is skeptical about upper-class values, but even though his new friend Nick figures him out, Nick doesn't mind because of a ""severe escort shortage"" and that Tom is good in conversations with him and his friends.

Meanwhile, Audrey has fallen for Tom but Tom has always been in love with Serena Slocum (played by Elizabeth Thompson) who is dating a baron named Rick Von Sloneker (played by Will Kempe) who Nick despises.

The film spotlights on the friendship and relationships of Tom and his group of upper-class friends which Charlie has crafted the new name of ""Urban Haute Bourgeoisie"".

VIDEO:

""Metropolitan - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #382' is presented in 1:66:1 color.  It's probably one of the few Criterion Collection films that looks its age but considering this was a low budget indie film, I'm not going to be too picky on picture quality.  There is a fine layer of grain and I'm guessing noise that can be seen on the print.

According to THE CRITERION COLLECTION, the DVD release is presented in its original Super 16mm.  Director Whit Stillman and director of photography John Thomas supervised the new HD transfer, which was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35mm blow-up interpositive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.

AUDIO:

According to THE CRITERION COLLECTION, the soundtrack for ""Metropolitan"" was mastered at 24-bit from the 35mm magnetic stems and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle. The film is Dolby Digital 1.0 and thus is center channel-driven. I chose to set my receiver to stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Metropolitan - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #326"" comes with the following special features:

  * Audio Commentary - Audio commentary by writer/director Whit Stillman, actors Christopher Eigeman and Taylor Nichols and editor Christopher Tellefsen.  Informative commentary on how certain scenes were filmed, filmmaking with a budget to reasons why some of the cast was stereotyped and unable to find work after ""Metropolitan"".  A pretty entertaining commentary!
  * Outtakes - (9:23) Outtakes from ""Metropolitan"".
  * Memorial - (1:00) Behind-the-scenes footage of line producer Brian Greenbaum who died in 1992.
  * Alternate Casting - Featuring two alternate castings that were not used in the film.  One titled ""Record Producer Allen"" starring Lloyd Kaufman (2:27) and the other ""Nick Smith"" (1:52) featuring Will Kempe (who plays Van Sloneker in the film) playing the character of Nick.  An optional commentary is included with Whit Stillman discussing why he changed the cast for those roles.
  * Original Theatrical Trailer - (2:06) The original theatrical trailer.

EXTRAS:

""Metropolitan - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #326"" comes with a quad-fold insert featuring an essay by Luc Sante titled ""After the Ball"".

""Metropolitan"" is a fantastic, entertaining and highly enjoyable film that many people have probably not heard of.

And after they see the trailer or read a little about it, I wouldn't be surprised if people tend to pass on the film because of its unknown actors and that it is a film that focuses on upper-class WASP students.  Correction... as the Charlie would say, ""Urban Haute Bourgeoisie"" (or ""UHB"") students which are neither a preppie or a WASP but a member of a group that because of its specific status, has nowhere to go but down.

It's a film that showcases intellectual conversation, engrossing dialogue and for those who are able to follow it and understand the humor within the film and its witty dialogue, you will easily find ""Metropolitan"" quite entertaining.

It's pretty interesting because I tend to bring up a film such as Eric Rohmer's ""My Night at Maud's"" or his earlier films in which the conversations were intellectual and engrossing but its what made Rohmer's films so intellectually stimulating.  They weren't meant for humor, ""Metropolitan"" is well-crafted for one to follow it and just laugh of the exchanges between the characters.

I absolutely enjoyed how the screenplay is written and the conversations that Stillman includes in this film.  For example, here is a conversation between the literary loving Audrey and the intellectual, Fourier admiring character, Tom.

AUDREY: I read that Lionel Trilling essay that you mentioned.  You really like Trilling?

TOM: Yes.

AUDREY:  I think he's very strange.  He says that nobody can like the heroine of ""Mansfield Park"".  I like her.  And then he goes on, and on, about how we modern people of today with our modern attitudes bitterly resentments for the park because its heroine is virtuous.  What's wrong with a novel having a virtuous heroine?

TOM: His point is that the novels premise there is something immoral in a group of young people putting on a play is pretty absurd.

AUDREY:  You found Fanny Price unlikeable?

TOM: She sounds pretty unbearable but I haven't read the book?

AUDREY: What?

TOM:  You don't have to read a book to have an opinion on it.  I haven't read the bible either.

AUDREY:  What Jane Austen novels have you read?

TOM: None.  I don't read novels.  I prefer good literary criticism.  That way you get both the novelist's ideas as well as the critics thinking. With fiction, I can never forget that none of it ever really happened, that its all just made up by the author.

This is just but one of the few conversations featured in the film.

""Metropolitan"" is probably one of those romantic comedies that definitely does its best in showcasing the life of young Manhattan debutantes.  And I have read that because Stillman's father was an attorney for President Kennedy (and his parents was divorced), he had the opportunity to see life in both worlds of rich and not rich at all and definitely provided some insight to the (disappearing?) lifestyle of young upperclass students.

I loved the characters of this film.  Personally, with the way the film is ostentatiously written, especially how characters (especially Charlie) who has this opprobrium feel to his fellow upperclass friends, he senses doom.  In no different of how a conservative views a liberal.  I loved the character of Audrey who is the most reminiscent of early Rohmer films with her discussions of literary likes.  And as a person who took part in high school book clubs to have these literary discussions, I have found Tom the most interesting of them all.  Not just in regards to his comment of not reading novels and following criticism (because even those of us who review films are guilty of reading reviews and essays from Sarris, Kael, Rosenbaum, Agee, etc. of films we may have not seen yet) but it's his take towards the upperclass and not being a fan of the debutante balls but yet hangs out with the UHB's and thus, there is a hypocrisy that begins to be unraveled as he starts to sort out his emotions and the way people around him have started to have an affect on him.

By no means is ""Metropolitan"" a film that is pedantic nor does it asks its viewer to be an erudite on literary and socio-economic topics.  But it does make for an engrossing film for those who know what the characters are talking about and for the most part, this is an independent film that it so well written and for a low budget film that deals with the upperclass, Whit Stillman has done a fantastic job with this film and definitely helped set things up for the writer/director for his next two films ""Barcelona"" and ""The Last Days of Disco"".  If anything, it has been over a decade since we have seen anything else from Stillman which is a shame because he is fine director and I hope we continue to see more films from the director.

As for the DVD, it may not be a release that has the typical CRITERION COLLECTION style of being loaded with bells and whistles, nor may it be one of their better looking films in the collection but for those who are fans of Stillman's work or a person who is craving for humorous but smart, engrossing dialogue will find ""Metropolitan"" to be to their liking.

Overall, ""Metropolitan"" is a film that I very much love but by saying that, I know this film is not for everyone.  But still ""Metropolitan"" is definitely a DVD release still worth recommending!",1282003200,12,11001,4.91490514905149

Terrible scriptwriting, terrible directing, terrible acting.  It's boring, cliched, and it is impossible to feel the slightest connection to any of the 2-D characters.  I winced through the whole thing.

The writer/director went to Harvard, and I can't help feeling like this is a product of the ""cult of Harvard"" where people project all kinds of intelligence and wit onto the grads.  Or I suppose his connections took him pretty far.  Whatever...I'm just guessing.  I have no other explanation for the success of this film.",1265414400,9,688,4.921739130434783
760463,5,6303995713,"One editorial review remarks ""as the innocent, easily manipulated Audrey.."". I seriously doubt it. You really must watch this picture several times before the parts fall into place. Take the opening scene when Tom 'accidentally' runs into Audrey's crowd. As the film later reveals Tom was given the ticket and has been sitting behind Audrey's table all night. He even went to the trouble to rent a tux for the occasion! He went to all this trouble in search of a woman by the name of Serena. The film also makes clear that he has never met anybody in the group. It's Audrey who's been looking him over. When Tom finally meets the woman, Serena, he learns that everybody writes to her and she never keeps any of them. She usually reads the very bad or the very good to her girl friends at the dorm but quickly assures him that his letters were always quite good. In fact her roommate liked them so much that she fell in love with him and kept them. Tom is horrified at this lack of privacy then stunned when he learns that Audrey was the roommate! Audrey wasn't an easily manipulated woman. One can only suspect that she manipulated Tom through the movie with the assistance of friends from time to time. Isn't it interesting that she's reading The Rector of Justin in the tanning scene? Or how she's dressed? Audrey deserves far more study in this film. Tom is far more related to Holly Martins of The Third Man. They are both struggling to learn what's happening around them. This film isn't for the one and done club. It needs more than one viewing to fully appreciate it. It was truly well done.",1260662400,28,1598,4.494845360824742
760464,3,6303995713,"i WOULD HAVE GIVEN ""Metropolitan"" 2 1/2 STARS, IF I COULD HAVE.  For me, it is definitely somewhere BETWEEN ""It's OK"" and ""I don't like it.""  But any number with 1/2 or better usually gets bumpted up to the next number...so a ""3 star movie"" it is, for me at least.

Now, I usually love ANYTHING dealing with the upper-crust.  ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" was amongst my VERY favourite TV shows, and, of course, my favourite movie star is Grace Kelly.  I have subscribed to both ""Town and Contry"" and ""Royalty"" magazines, (""Royalty"" is far superiour -- for obvious reasons).  So, I approached the viewing of this movie with anticipation and relish!  Oh...to be a debutante!

Well, I ws more than disappointed.  This movie purports to be a ""comedy"".  I did not laugh, (or even smile), once.  It is not a tragedy, exactly....just a drama, I guess.  The dialogue, though literate, seems to make no connective sense, and, (for me at least), the story went n-o-w-h-e-r-e.  There seemed no connectivity between once scene and another to me, though I tried, as you might imagine, VERY hard to CONCEMTRATE on the plot.  I just couldn't understand
WHERE the characters of this movie were going, why they were going where they were going, and what they were doing to get there. (Where?)  Further, though most of the characters proported to be ""of he debutante set"", they all took CABS.  All the time!  True, the one ""middle class"" character is criticised for being a ""public transportation snob"" -- one who looks down on people who take cabs, (and in once scene, surrpetitiously takes a cross-town bus) -- but, hey, aren't these supposed to be RICH people -- VERY rich people?  VERY rich people -- in New York City, as well as elsewhere -- do not, as a rule, even take cabs.  THEY HAVE CHAUFFEURS!  Not one mention of chauffeurs was in the dialogue!  And half the time, the group WALK through the Manhattan night!  Now, I know from the
commentary given with the DVD, that this film, purportedly to be about VERY rich, young, New Yorkers, was actually shot on a very slender budget -- even the girls' gowns were lent by someone else!
However, if chauffeurs -- and their limosines -- were not available on the film's budget, couldn't they have creatively solved the problem by having dialogue like: ""It's the chauffeur's week off"", or ""Our chauffeur was sick, and finding a replacement is beastly difficult -- you know what the servant problem is these days?""  Or even, ""We prefer our chauffeur to drive a mid-size car.  Far less
noticable, you know.""  This way, the upper-upper status of all the characters but one would have been solidified -- and perhaps an interesting new character added.  But no -- except for the middle-class boy who surrepitiously took the cross-town bus, all the characters here used CABS!  So, their NON-upper-upper class status was assured.  I was disappointed.

The dialogue here is wearying.  I could not, as stated above, make out where the characters were going with their lives...unless, of course, to just MAKE OUT!  I am sure that REAL very rich young people, even in the 1990s, when this picture was made, wanted to do MORE with their lives than just talk philosophy and, er, (again), MAKE OUT!

I did learn how to dress, informally, like a lady ""preppy"" from some of the scenes, (large pull-over sweater with a blouse's collar peeping out).  The scenes of the characters walking into the Manhattan, New York night were very true to life, (I've lived in one of the outer boroughs for most of my life, so I should know.)  There is a combination in the Manhattan night air of sucess and desparation, from all the people in the city experiencing these two extremes --and what lies between them -- that you can just about FEEL these emotions if you try...and you don't really have to try all that hard.  The outdoors, night scenes of Manhattan, with the characters walking through it, really did re-communucate this feeling to me.

But, trying to follow a story which was, to me at least, unfollow-able, led to me concentrating SO hard as I tried....that I fell asleep!  So, this is a VERY good movie for those sleepless nights -- it does the job of putting the viewer to sleep better than any commercial sleep product -- prescription or non-prescription -- even better than turkey and/or warm milk.  Concentrating to get the jist of a difficult-to-follow movie DOES have its rewards -- or it did for me!

The insert with the DVD is very expansive.  Along with many details about the film, it is printed in two typefaces, (names not given), which ""scream"" upper-crust.  Must be on the lookout for those two typefaces!  Seeing them is a true gift to an elegance-starved person like myself!

In sum, this is an odd movie, an old movie...but, for some purposes, quite a good movie.  Not for following story and plot...for those are almost unfathonable, (or at least they were for me.)  The ""casual"" ladies' dress styles CAN teach one how to dress like a day-time preppy, (although the evening clothes, especially on the young ladies, seemed quite haphazadly chosen.)
And -- watching it can make a dandy anti-insomnia treatment!  This movie was NOT what I expected -- but still, I did get some benefits from it I had never expected!",1258848000,2,5254,4.730473047304731
760465,4,6303995713,"Started off as a lot of verbal bluster and parrying, but the characters seemed to grow more attractive and the plot more interesting over time.  Yet, the setting and storyline seem somewhat farfetched in that it's difficult to imagine that young people this brilliant, empathetic, intellectual, rich and astute actually exist in real life. Or maybe I've been hanging out in the wrong circles. Bottom line--viewers attracted to highbrow drama and character studies will eat this film up.",1258588800,3,486,5.230769230769231

760507,5,6303995713,"The heroine of Stillman's micro-peek, Manhattan preppies, she enjoys Jane Austin.  Therefore, it is fitting that musings about relationships are mostly in stodgy wasp fantasy, harking to the 19th Century.  In addition, these boys and gals have a bowtie existence, a sub strata concept that has worked for a long time.  The more experimental might have a fling with a Long Island count or a Jew record executive, but discretion please.  When they marry, well, within their bridge circle I'm sure.

If I give the impression that outsiders, just about everybody, wouldn't enjoy the Vassar quasi-intellectualism of youth, you would be wrong, for the subject is handled with love. These kids are sensitive, cocktail in gloved hand, their parent's divorce, impossible expectations, the looming failure discourse of the boys, all to be handled sometime in the future with aplomb. Don't ask an older prep what he does.  It's unbearable to discuss their lowly profession.

Stillman is a true genius, projecting the character of brilliant, tortured wit, Nick, (Christopher Elgman), a cynic with cutting observation, and possibly he is often right.  The boy wears a top hat like most wear a baseball cap. Stillman is creating something from what he knows, a series of debutant parties and interrelationships, amusing attitudes, these birds are rare exotics.",1238112000,2,1346,5.257009345794392
760508,5,6303995713,"Whit Stillman's film `Metropolitan' comes off like a wicked mix of Woody Allen and Robert Altman, making art out of general conversation and allowing us, the audience, to relate wholly to the situation by keeping everything grounded and within our grasp.  Nothing happens within this film that could not or would not happen in reality, and that makes the concept and the end result all the more interesting.  There are times where the film seems to be about nothing at all, which may be what makes the film so endearing.  We become fascinated with the general conversation of these individuals, the whole time wondering what it is all really about, and then it hits us that the film is an exploration of youth in general and it's through these conversations that we get to dissect their lives.

So the film focuses on a group of upper-class socialites who find their clique infiltrated by the middle-class Tom.  Tom is admittedly turned off by the needless parties these socialites entertain, and thus he immediately becomes entertaining to the higher-class preppies who find his viewpoints on their engagements fascinating.  As the two worlds come together through interaction they realize that they are not so different after all.  They know the same people, they read the same books; in fact it is only a social title that differentiates one from the other.

The film sheds light on the attitudes that propel these young adults through their lives as we see subtle yet powerful messages sent between parties.  As young Audrey expresses her desire to court the outsider Tom we get to see just how the line between class distinctions does not mean there is a line between class in general.

The script may very well be my favorite script of 1990, maybe even the 90's in general (although that is probably pushing it a bit).  It is smart and witty and insightful if one is really paying attention, and the cast of characters is truly diverse and interesting.

Each and every actor here really does a fine job of elevating the script, especially Christopher Eigeman who plays the devilishly sincere Nick Smith.  His portrayal of your typical preppie is so deep-seated and authentic that he makes you feel as though you are standing right next to him, having each scene feel as though it was cut from your own reality.  His charisma and charm are undeniable and his delivery is smooth as butter.  Carolyn Farina is also wonderful as the tragically underappreciated Audrey, and Edward Clements soars as the outsider Tom.  His watchful eye is felt throughout every frame as he takes in his acquaintances and silently judges them, never once looking at himself to see how he should be judged.

If you are a fan of Altman or Allen then this is a film for you, for it is just as witty, just as conversational and just as natural as either of the aforementioned director's bodies of work.  The film may not appeal to everyone; well, it will not appeal to everyone.  If you are wanting a briskly paced drama or a high octane thriller then you are looking in the wrong place, but if you are wanting a well developed and smart character study that will hold your attention despite its lack of real drama then this is the perfect film for you.",1222387200,8,3231,4.7272727272727275

760510,4,6303995713,"I don't think I had seen ""Metropolitan"" all the way through since its opening in 1990.  As I was about the same age then as the characters portrayed in this film (though not from the same background), and had recently lived in NYC, the poignancy of seeing scenes from what NYC once looked like - circa late '80's, early '90's - will only add to your enjoyment of this graceful, beautiful jewel of a film. The lives of young preppies, and their disappearing way of life, is portrayed with wit and skill by a strong, young cast, tight direction, and a literate script. The Tom Townsend character, from ""the West Side,"" and, hence, not truly part of the gang, and his romance with Audrey, sensitively played by Carolyn Farina, forms the spine of the story. And here is my only true quibble with this wonderful film: the love story is left rather unrealized and director Stillman backs away from the romance too much, I think, in order to be ""ironic"" and ""trendy"" - and yet, even Audrey says, ""life is melodramatic,"" when you follow it all the way through. The story really needed - and deserved - a better resolution. Also, the GREAT piano score, and swift, sharp as a knife editing, that is there for almost 2/3 thirds of the film, seems to disappear as the film goes on, inexplicably, as it sets such a wonderful mood. The overall score is great, but I felt that piano score, and the bittersweet scenes between Tom and Audrey that are so well done, should have formed a greater part of the resolution.  Still, with that said, this film is worth seeing - and owning. The Criterion Collections, I feel, are not as good as they should be - I wanted more extras, a real documentary, even a brief one, on the making of the film - but the transfer is FIRST CLASS - the movie looks absolutely beautiful.  You wonder what happened to these young actors.  You also might wonder what happened to Stillman, as the film heralded a career that seemed on its way to examining modern life in ways both witty and profound.  Still, NYC on Christmas, even a brief scene of Christmas mass, a beautiful score, good actors, wonderful direction, and a way of life both subtle and graceful (and, I think, far more sexy too), ""Metropolitan"" deserves its ranking as one of the most influential independent films - and, despite its flaws, it's just about perfect.",1211846400,4,2336,4.56563245823389
760511,5,6303995713,"Between the lost decade of F. Scott Fitzgerald and the aftermath of the sexual and social revolution of '68, before street drugs, grundge, and now broker metrosexuals, there was once a different kind of decadence, when youth of parental privilege liberally spent their parents' fortunes but somehow still talked with genuine interest about ideas, all the while facing a dimly growing fear of failure and of falling upon leaving paradise at Princeton. This subtly satirical reminiscence of preppy life is practically peerless, perfectly fusing screenplay, acting, and cinematography.  It takes place during the early 1960s on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, among young twenty-somethings who prepped at the best schools and now are Ivy Leaguers or Seven Sisters students, shortly before coeducation and the pill sexualized cloistered college life.  Like Martin Scorsese's allegorical concert film ""The Last Waltz"" (1976), ""Metropolitan"" is ostensibly about another finale: ""the last deb season as we know it"". It is also a larger period piece of wit, wonder, and even nostalgia for an era long gone.  And as a sexagenarian who once witnessed that life first-hand, I can say with some authority that its tone is perfect.",1199404800,10,1220,5.310880829015544

Today's students may wonder-- Just how far did the conservative backswing of the social pendulum travel once Reagan and Republican ideas gave it a shove?  Pretty far, by the looks of this upstart, independent film production.

760515,5,6303995713,"Any true gemstone has flaws and inclusions that confirms its origins in nature. And so it is with Whit Stillman's masterpiece Metropolitan.

In a passage of cultural reflection, one of the characters uses strained dialogue to identify themselves as a dying tribe of ""urban haute bourgeoisie."" It was pretty obvious Stillman was trying not to use the term ""preppy,"" and for several good reasons. Among them were that Lisa Birnbach's book had debased the coinage and copper-plated poseurs abounded. In addition, he was also drawing attention to the arrival of international class (a reveres of Henry James?) youngsters gambolling in the canyons of Manhattan (no, the term ""Euro-Trash also would not do...especially for young countesses who went to Convent school). He also could not use the term NOKD (not-our-kind-dear) or it would go over the heads of the audience. Ditto ""Sloane Ranger.""

Another hilarious passage is the description of organic and inorganic deb balls, and those that required escorts from one of the United States service academies. The irony of the excluded insiders of the inorganic deb ball watching the event on television is Stillman's hilarious allusion to the death knell of the form, intention, and social expression at the roots of the event, and carried on the leitmotif of the televised broadcast of Diana Spencer and the Prince of Wales wedding.

The other general flaw is the arch, stilted dialogue. People write like this, but I don't think they really talk like this, no matter how rarefied their education. Which makes watching this movie like reading a book.

But a gem of a book, with excellent illustrations.

That the characters are well-to-do (including the slightly less well-to-do sort-of protagonist) either makes the whole ordeal irrelevant, or maybe it just gets rid of the discomforting baggage of poverty and survival so that all of our attention can focus on what really matters:  Tux Rental vs. Secondhand Tux.

The big deal is the protagonist's emotional epiphany that sort of takes place at some point during the movie.  The REAL substance of the movie is the humor of humorous UHB (""urban haute bourgeoisie"") semi-caricatures talk at each other in various upper east side apartments (there's also something of an absurd rescue mission at the end).

760592,5,6303995713,"This movie glistens like a piece of old Belleek. Whether in the subtle gold of an off the shoulder evening gown, or in the vast expanse of a deep, plush, ivory colored carpet, nearly every frame shimmers with champagne like iridescence.

And gold is an apt visual metaphor, particularly when juxtaposed against the black satin of a tuxedo lapel or the wintry Manhattan night scape, for a world seemingly vanishing right before our eyes--a world too sleek, too soign, too genteel to survive the steam roller of galloping blue-jeaned egalitarianism.

That the denizens of this vanishing breed, as depicted in the film, are themselves, insecure late adolescents, make its departure all the more poignant.

""This is probably the last Deb season..."" one of them observes resignedly, ""...because of the stock market, the economy, Everything..."" Yes, everything...the huge smothering subject that hovers all around the plot itself and from which its characters are only temporarily insulated.

In particular, the focus here is on a group of privileged Eastern Seaboard collegians enjoying the Christmas holidays in a series of Park Avenue, ""after dance parties,"" in which they loll about and ruefully anticipate the disappearance of their youth, their success, and their kind.

That they are one at the same time cerebral, immature, literate, prankish, frightened, polished, well educated but vulnerable and inexperienced, puts them well outside the troglodyte teens that inhabit the deconstructionist zoo in most post 1970 films, (with the exception of a unfortunate and mis-placed ""strip poker"" sequence which violates the picture's otherwise overall mood.)

Indeed, they seem to exist outside their own time, belonging rather to that group Cecil Beaton dubbed ""the smart young things"" from the 1920's, in his ""The Glass of Fashion."" Certainly, one imagines them far more comfortable with Ivor Novello than Mick Jagger. And like many ""smart sets"" they seem rather a closed corporation.

Until that is, into their number unexpectedly arrives a young man of reduced circumstances, Tom Townsend, (Edward Clements) who by virtue of his sincerity and intelligence, is invited to ""sup at their table--on a borrowed pass"" so to speak. His romantic misadventures with the beguiling Audrey Rouget(Carolyn Farina)forms the cynosure of the charmingly fragile plot.

Audrey and Tom stand out from the pack, in their earnestess and integrity, though it is assuredly Nick, (Christopher Eigeman) their figurehead and chief quip master who is the groups' un-elected leader. As interpreted by Mr. Eigeman, Nick is the embodiment of the cocktail fueled, cigarette wielding bon vivant--trenchant, self absorbed, far from virtuous, and with a ready verbal arrow that never misses its target. He is George Sander's heir presumptive.

Nick's observations are worth the whole price of admission as they say, whether it be bemoaning the Protestant Reformation, the social climbing Surrealists, or the scarcity of detachable collars.

Since the film's short, bouffant,cocktail dresses and automobiles unmistakably place the film in very late modernity--the Reagan era in fact, and long after the Ray Anthony's Orchestra, top hatted milieu it depicts, we cannot fail to miss the film's core observation--the parallel evanescence of the groups' own social connections, as placed against the simultaneous collapse of civilized life as we once knew it.

As the Christmas season ends, so do the nightly gatherings, and each character is forced to come to terms with impermanence--their own and everything else's. In a melancholy bar scene, an older man warns the youngsters of disappointment ahead, ""I'm not destitute but...it's all so mediocre.""

That Producer/Director Whit Stillman manages to fuse the personal with the sociological in such and intriguing and entrancing way is a testament to the penetration of his vision.

And, lest we miss the point, he includes a cunning shot of a significant book left on bedside table--none other than Spengler's ""Decline of the West.""",1165795200,56,4043,5.429027113237639

760594,5,6303995713,"Made for almost nothing, Whit Stillman's lovely first film from 1990 demonstrates that the pleasures of film can lie in dialogue as well as in images in motion. Tom Townsend, a cynical Princetonian from the West Side, is persuaded to invest in renting a tux by a set of more privileged peers who want him to accompany them to debutante balls at glamorous faded hotels like the Plaza and the St. Regis, and then hang out until all hours in their deluxe East Side apartments afterwards. The film cuts costs as ingeniously as Tom by filming most of its scenes in these swanky living rooms (one of which was owned by the parents of one of the young actors). The film depicts a basically Fitzgeraldean vision of the young and wealthy, with the boys mostly romantic cynics and all the young women (except the idealized Audrey, the shy heroine who falls in love with Tom) more pragmatic and sexually adventurous. But Stillman's feel for this world seems very real, and his dialogue is very sprakiling and literate (the intellectual sources the young people cite--Fourier and Trilling--are charmingly anachronistic). The cast is excellent, although the standouts are Chris Eigemann, as the funny and trenchant Nick, and the gifted Carolyn Farina, who makes the timid Audrey seem deeply endearing.",1155340800,4,1288,4.940092165898617

760709,5,6303995713,"This movie captures a timeless social class at the end of the 1980s: yet apart from the poufty dresses worn by the women, and the ponytail worn by the unspeakable von Slonecker, it could be made today, because in fact there is a quiet Transcendentalist class in the tristate region...which despite its wealth has been out of the American loop since Andrew Jackson.

Brooks Brothers has been vulgarized since the 1980s. It now dresses the fat, loud new rich in their loose and baggy clothes which dialectically draw a line between a work of increasing savagery and a play that may have Thorstein Veblen laughing in Elysium while breaking down that line. This is a dialectic because the sartorial breaking down of the line conceals its strengthening.

With silences worthy of Henry James, who, were he (shudder) to have to write for Hollywood, would want, despite his reputation for verbosity, to specify the length of pauses, this movie is a sweet little fable about what it is to be that part of the ruling class without the stomach, the flan if you will, to rebuild family fortunes by expropriating what's left of the American middle class and its sons of toil.

While most of the characters, according to a charming essay in the DVD by Luc van Sante, probably still have their virginal cherry, they have passed the new SAT requirement for an essay with flying colors, it appears, for except for the reprehensible proto-George Bush von Slonecker, they speak in compound sentences to convey meaningful, if complex thoughts.

Which of course is a major thought-crime in an America where words are clubs and complexity of speech under a cloud.

With the exception of ""Audrey Rouget"", the girls are spoiled rotten by feminism, but ""Audrey"" is a gem as a performance, and, as a real person somewhere in Manhattan, she is one of those NY women who no-one can deserve, a Portrait of a Lady who shall go on serving tea to friends and her eleemosynary Sellinger's Round.

With the exception of le monstre Slonecker, the guys are knights-errant, even Fred, who at first seems like the kid in the school play who plays the Moon because he is dyslexic, but has a surprising star turn which I shall not reveal. Fred is decorative only at first because he is consistently passed out in formal attire on the divan: but even here there are hidden depths.

Fred is the Satyr in stone and as such a quiet master of those revels upon which the postparty gathering is a comment as he slumbers peacefully. There is a classicism to Fred.

I was working at Princeton when this film was made and the average decent Princeton students were much like the kids in this film. There were hijinx: the 1989 class carried a sign saying ""the Nation in Princeton's service: Wall Street here we come"".

But the truth is in this film. Fortunately, you can still fail even with inherited wealth and a degree from Princeton. George Bush may want to change this by eliminating the inheritance tax.

But not even the income tax that SHOULD be charged (90 cents on the last dollar at the top income) would eliminate true American nobility, a democratic nobility content to do the right thing. Might even bring it back.

760711,5,6303995713,"The early `90s marked the emergence of two independent filmmakers who were seen as possible heirs to Woody Allen's cinematic legacy: Noah Baumbach (Kicking and Screaming) and Whit Stillman. Stillman, in particular, has often been cited in the same breath as Allen's films. They both mine the same social strata - affluent, Upper East Side New Yorkers - for comedy. Stillman's debut, Metropolitan, is his most Allen-esque, right down to the simple opening credits sequence accompanied by jazz music. Stillman's characters, like Allen's, also speak witty dialogue loaded with literary references. However, this is where the similarities begin and end. In Allen's films, he presents upper class characters that are narcissistic and self-absorbed while Stillman tends to gently parody these qualities.

Even though their group is known as the Sally Fowler Rat Pack, Nick is their unofficial leader dominating many of the conversations with his caustic wit. Tom is seen as something of an intriguing outsider (at one point, Nick notices that he lives on the Upper West Side). He's not as rich as the others but is able to hold his own intellectually. Charlie (Nichols) doesn't like Tom because he has a thing for Audrey and knows that she fancies this social interloper. Throughout it all, Nick is Tom's way into the group and lays out the social rules for him (he shows him the proper etiquette and fashion tips). Tom is obviously the audience surrogate and along with him, we are immersed in this rarified social milieu.

Metropolitan takes place during the Christmas holidays and depicts the inevitable decline of the Sally Fowler Rat Pack, much as Charlie theories early on in the film, confirming his fears of the decline of their generation. He even attempts to define it and frets that they are doomed to decline financially, lamenting the inevitable demise of the Preppie class. He also comes up with the term ""Urban Haute Bourgeoisie"" or UHB (pronounced ""UB"") to describe his class but, in reality, it is just another word for Preppie. Initially, the characters in the movie may seem pretentious but I believe that Stillman wants us to see past this faade to the anxiety-ridden personas that lie beneath as typified by Charlie.

There is a certain timeless quality to the movie. There is no real indicator of the time period it is set in and this makes it the most enduring of Stillman's three films - Barcelona and The Last Days of Disco - that form a loose knit trilogy of doomed Preppies in love. With Metropolitan, he has created a fully realized world with well-written characters that he has real affection for and this makes for an enjoyable movie.

There is an audio commentary by Stillman, editor Christopher Tellefsen and actors Christopher Eigeman and Taylor Nichols. Stillman talks about working on a small budget and points out examples in the film where they cut costs. Eigeman and Nichols recall their impressions of working on what was their feature film debut. This is a relaxed, low-key track full of intelligent observations as you would expect from people responsible for a smart movie.

""Outtakes"" features a montage of raw footage that was not used and includes blown line readings, several kinds of reaction shots for a given scene and a tribute to the film's line producer who died in 1992.

There are two clips of ""Alternate Casting"" with optional commentary by Stillman. In one segment we see Will Kempe as Nick Smith who Stillman says was up for the role with Eigeman but he felt that ultimately, Kempe did not have the right kind of chemistry with Edward Clements that Eigeman did.

Chris Eigeman is way more charming and funny than he has any right to be as the smarmy and downright obnoxious fraud who one night, by chance - ?, befriends a Conan O'Brien look-alike in a baje-colored overcoat.

It's through this meeting that our hero (the carrot top) meets Audrey, a charming and sadly insecure young lady who finds him intriguing, if he would only reciprocate those feelings. Yes, the heartstrings and nerves of these bright young things are very tangled, indeed.

Stillman, who made his fearsome, forceful writing-directorial debut here, has crafted a bittersweet and wonderfully eloquent take on the yuppie lifestyle and the love lives of a particular circle of friends within that strata of society.

The great news: The Criterion Collection, known for their brilliant and astonishing treatments of great films, have wisely decided to release this film for the first time ever on DVD!

Basically, viewers either see this film as a funny, sensitive piece about intelligent young people coming to terms with who they are (camp 1) or as a gaggle of whiny preppies wallowing in emotional self indulgence (camp 2). The middle ground is small. Given the five star rating, I think it is clear that I fall into the first camp--perhaps, it helps that I came from a background that was itself somewhat preppy--the major characters actually correspond to real people that I went to college with. the sheltered life, the late night bull sessions, the excessive worry about one's future, the cynical personas (i.e. Nick Smith), the cocktail party radicalism (i.e. Tom Townsend), and the curious mix sophistication with naivete are really quite real.

760715,2,6303995713,"So What?
One of the great American myths is that we all have, locked up inside us, at least one great story just waiting to be told. Whit Stillman apparently thought he had at least three, the subjects of his trilogy-""Metropolitan,"" ""Barcelona"" and ""The Last Days of Disco"".
In fact, it's just one story, and one that is not very interesting. It's the story of spoiled, upper middle class (but not rich, i.e., financially independent) children who think they're intelligent, witty and urbane, but are actually clueless.
""Metropolitan,"" the first film in the trilogy, presents this group in New York over Christmas vacation during their last year in prep school, while they are making the endless round of society balls. The ostensible hero, played by Edward Clements, is the down-and-out son of divorced parents, who is adopted by the others as a plaything for the holidays. Unfortunately, he is just as shallow as they. The real hero, Charlie Black played by Taylor Nichols, is simply weird. But Whit Stillman clearly likes him, since he stars in ""Barcelona"" and makes a cameo appearance in ""The Last Days of Disco.""
The most interesting character, Nick Smith played by Charles Eigeman, is a cynic who has virtually all of the good lines. Interestingly, he ended up starring in both ""Barcelona"" and ""The Last Days of Disco"". But even he is not enough to save this turkey.
The used video dealer from whom I bought this video accidentally sent me a copy that had huge yellow Spanish subtitles spread out across the bottom half of the screen. Normally, this would be an irritant, but in the case of ""Metropolitan"" it enhanced the surreal nature of the film.
If you decide you have to sample Stillman's work, watch ""The Last Days of Disco"" first, then ""Barcelona."" That way, you may give up before getting to ""Metropolitan.""",1083974400,12,1821,4.858520900321543

This movie is not your typical teen movie. Though there isn't much action, the movie is full of character and is fueled by the witty, informative, and thought-provoking dialogue that pours from each character. However, unlike many of the 1970s dialogue-heavy films, METROPOLITAN doesn't become boring.

Its funny how Tom who originally hates the debutante dances, begins to depend on them, while Nick becomes disgusted with them.
The story shows how friendships can blossom, cultivate, and die out.  Each person in the end has his or her own values and goals and needs to not rely totally on a clique for every bit of social activity.  None the less, one should not be a loner either.

It goes to show you that preppie's have feelings too.",1008806400,4,913,4.838709677419355
760777,5,6303995713,"I cannot add a great deal to the generous praise justly lavished on this splendid film by previous reviews.  I am a virgin cinema critic but am driven to write a review of 'Metropolitan' as this is one of the few films I have watched over and over again and continue to marvel at. I first saw 'Last Days of Disco' and took an instant liking to Stillman's unique blend of young, witty and attractive characters and his depiction of 'preppy' reflections and relationships amidst the musical and visual backdrop of 'The Club.'
On the basis of the director's name I bought Metropolitan and would argue that this film is a masterpiece on an altogther higher level to the stylish and accomplished 'Last Days'. In my opinion Metropolitan ranks equally alongside other celebrated films such as 'Manhattan' by Woody Allen, and, in its incredible attention to dialogue, characterization and depiction of a social milieu, to Martin Scorcese's 'Goodfellas'. Chris Eigeman as the snobbish but endearing Nick Smith deserves special mention.
I thoroughly recomend this outstanding film to anyone with an interest in social satire, comedy, and cinema in general and I shall endeavour to track down Stillman's second film Barcelona. My younger brother intends to pursue a career as a cinema director and I shall suggest to him he looks for inspiration to Whit Stillman as much as his current role model, Martin Scorcese. Both are masters of their art.",988588800,10,1434,4.975
760778,5,6303995713,"This film touched poignantly on a subculture that has to look hard for the validating reflections of self that others so easily find watching Married with Children, or Everyone Loves Raymond.  Some of other reviewers missed key points though; Tom was not a member of the middle class looking in.  He was a far more tragic character - that of an upper class on the edge of descending downward.  His father was ""U"", but upon the divorce his mother descended to ""non-U"".  So he walked the path of privileged upbringing but limited adult means - accepted by his U friends, but never truly being able to compete financially. As for this lifestyle being obsolete or non-existent?  Obsolete perhaps.  WASPs are no longer the sole heirs to America's fortunes.  But just because you haven't recently been invited to a Cotillion doesn't mean that they aren't going on all the same.",985305600,6,871,4.805369127516778
760779,5,6303995713,"Metropolitan, the first of Stillman's trilogy of the lost aristocracy, is a fine example of the classical comedy. This is a very dense film, and much more than merely a comedy of manners (yet one says the same for Austen), but rather an exploration of the new lost generation: the children of the baby-boomers. In addition, these children form what would have been the aristocracy, yet in post-WWII America (or perhaps even post-civil war America, depending on your understanding of national history) the Aristocracy's place has disapeered. Not that Stillman is critiquing the Aristocracy itself, as one reviewer insinuated--far from it--Stillman is no egalitarian, and no doubt appreciates the role of class. Yet much like Descartes' example of the man with an amputated limb, who still feels sensation in that limb, these urban elites of New York are clumsily trying to fit into a mold that is antithetical to spirit of their culture. This is especially developed later in Last Days of Disco, as these Ivy-league grads who learned hard capitalism and aggresive business theory, still try to settle into their aristocratic positions allthewhile employing the economic principles they learned at college.
In this analysis of a young aristocracy without a tradition (which Stillman understands indeed in the Burkean sense), these youths spend the holidays going to dances and hanging out afterwords at each others apartments.
I don't want to offer simply a Cliff's notes to Stillman, so I won't let out all the insights that Stillman offers, while demanding much from the viewer in order to understand them. There's the enjoyment. Just pay attention to religious symbolism; that's huge for Stillman. (Ex. there is a moment in the film when one of the character's is leaving on a train, and a hymn by Luther is playing in the background) If you want some more hints, Nationalreview.com had an interview with him a while back you can probably still get, and Intercollegiate Review had a whole journel dedicated to his works a year or so ago.
Stillman is by far the greatest director around today--his cultural commentary has the weight of a Proust or Claudel--don't miss it.",985046400,13,2171,5.084033613445378
760780,5,6303995713,"I have been waiting for this film on DVD for years.  This is an incredible film with some great dialog.  Chris Eigeman is incredible as a sarcastic, egomaniac snob.  This is Whit Stillmans first film.  Be sure to check out Barcelona and Last Days of Disco.
This film is very dialog driven.  Most of it is spent with a group of friends discusing just about everything they have learned in college and being snobs, but it's incredible fun.  This is a small budget film with a group of talented actors and a great script.  This is not a standard Hollywood movie, but it is a great break from them.",984528000,7,594,4.394495412844036

This is Whit's masterpiece, although Barcelona is almost up to Metropolitan's standard. I like the fact that these are all unknown actors, as it tends to make the characters more true to life. The dialogue is pefect for the setting and subject, and unlike another reviewer stated, you do not have to be a member of high society to enjoy this film. This movie and Barcelona desrve to be on DVD!",972950400,6,534,4.404040404040404
760783,5,6303995713,"You can tell the movie was filmed on a shoestring, and it occasionally  feels claustrophobic when Stillman tries to imply the presence of  nonexistent crowds of revelers, but you simply won't care...you'll be too  caught-up in its warm and humane story.
The movie takes place ""not  too long ago""...since director Whit Stillman, who based this heavily  on his own life experience, was born in 1952, it might take place sometime  in the early- to mid-1970's...then again, it might not.  The movie feels  truly timeless, in part because the debutante characters are acting out  high-society roles that became obsolete decades before they were born.
Although we the viewers know that this subculture--if it ever really  existed--was morbidly shallow and self-absorbed, Stillman pulls off the  neat trick of making us care about these people regardless.  The  disintegration of their clique isn't the end of the world, but it's handled  poignantly, so that we feel their fear at having to confront an uncertain  future.  And the way things are dealt with, we're always aware of the fact  that these characters were leading their lives before we became acquainted  and will continue to do so after the credits roll.",967939200,11,1209,5.112820512820512

7859126,2,6303995713,"Great movie-Blu-Ray quality is AWFUL
I love this movie ever since I watched it on TCM a couple of years of ago. I recorded it on my DVR and I have watched it too many times to remember. I love to watch it during Christmas.  I'm not from Manhattan, but West Texas.  Whitman script and the great delivery by these talented first time actors transports me completely. The movie production is structured like a play. The dialogue is the star of the movie and is some of the best EVER written for a movie.  But, this movie is not for everybody. It rewards the careful listener and is meant for multiple viewings. I bought this Blu-Ray for the commentary which is fantastic.
Bad News: The blu-ray transfer is horrible. The picture is full of noise. Looking at the skin of the actors reveals lots of black dots. The movie was filmed in Super 16 MM (and the director himself admits in the commentary that the lighting for many of the scenes was poorly executed) so  I don't know if that affected the overall quality of the source material for the Blu-Ray.  But, man it is bad. In fact my DVR copy from TCM is better!  Please tell Criterion to re-issue this movie into a better Blu-Ray version.  It deserves it!",1481846400,,1202,4.4363636363636365

Carolyn Farina is radiant in her innocence, and Chris Eigeman debuts as one of the most underrated comic actors of his generation. Taylor Nichols is the perfect comic foil for Eigeman (a relationship reprised in Stillman's Barcelona). Nichols' stammering earnestness and Eigeman's glib, one-liner cynicism are the perfect complement for one another. This will be Whit Stillman's lasting contribution to late-modern American cinema.",1474848000,2,541,5.948717948717949
