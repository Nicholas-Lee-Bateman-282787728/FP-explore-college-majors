I was watching it on Hulu and watching the highlights over and over again on Youtube as well as the celebration. Luckily game 7 is on this DVD and the celebration on the ice afterward is also included! We get an interview with Mario after the Game 1 SCF Blackhawks win (coming from behind, incredibly exciting) and another come from behind victory is included, game 6 vs. Philadelphia, with Max shushing the crowd (two interviews after that one, Fleury and Crosby). The picture quality of the games is even better than Volume One, and seeing Crosby raising the Cup is priceless. I love this set! LETS GO PENS!",1300060800,13,684,4.524193548387097
4320838,5,B004BZ5AIM,If Penguins are getting a volume 2 then other teams should be getting another set. The choice of games for Pens looks good for this one too! I know there are teams that have not got a Greatest Games yet..Warner needs to get going with releasing more dvd sets of other teams!,1293753600,5,274,4.288461538461538
8422530,5,B004BZ5AIM,"I have Vol 1, Vol 2 of the Greatest Penguins games was a must.
Great moments of some fan favorites, including Lemieux, Jagr, Francis, Barasso, Wregget, Straka, Nedved and Crosby.",1485475200,,178,4.966666666666667

8422532,5,B004BZ5AIM,"Some amazing games in this set. I like to watch the older games to see how much players get away with compared to today.

If your a Penguins fan, this is for you. Also, check out the first series of games on DVD.",1389052800,,212,3.9302325581395348
8422533,5,B004BZ5AIM,"I have been in love with the Pens since the 90's and have had to sit through several rough seasons.  I have a ton of VHS (recorded off of TV) games, and some of my favorite games are here in this set.  Great buy for any Pens fans.  I just wish there was a way to get all the games up online for me to access at any time.  Instead of just an NHL Vault, they should have a Penguins Vault.  All their greatest games, and the HBO series up there as well.  I'd pay a subscription for that.",1372204800,2,484,3.8383838383838382
8422534,1,B004BZ5AIM,"I was so excited to finally get my hands on the greatest game in penguins history, the 1992 comeback win against the blackhawks in Game 1 of the SC FInals; this game was inexplicably left out of the original 10 Greatest Games edition. All 10 of those games had the original Mike Lange commentary overlaying the games, so my expectation was that this volume would have that as well. Not so. Instead, the Chicago Blackhawks (a team residing in the US) vs the Pittsburgh Penguins (another team residing in the US) game is overlayed with the announcers from Hockey Night in Canada. Absurd. This was a huge disappointment.",1371513600,7,617,4.722222222222222
