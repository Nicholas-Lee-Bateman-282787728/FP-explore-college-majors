8003220,5,B0000UX4U8,"This DVD is without a doubt my favorite rave visuals DVD collection.  The content was made in my favorite year for dance music, 1992, and so as a result these visuals are the authentic accompanyment for music from this year.  The graphics are rough, chunky, unfinished looking, and just plain gritty.  This is just wonderful because this is how rave visuals looked like back then.  Its not all rough computer animation either.  At times there are interesting real world footage that is put through video filters and overlaid on the computer graphics.  One such scene is of a HUSS mfg ""Break Dancer"" amusement ride which shows the ride cars swooshing past the screen which looks very nice.  The music on this DVD set is actually very nice which is not surprising since this is 1992 techno, progressive house, and some UK 'Ardkore.  The 3rd video set is actually really nice ambient music which includes Sven Vath's lovely ""Cavern of Emotions"".

Overall if your a fan or record collector of classic rave music or if you just want to relive this era, this DVD is an absolute must have.",1296518400,2,1082,4.712765957446808
