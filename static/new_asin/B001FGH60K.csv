8326434,5,B001FGH60K,"This is the second DVD by Bill Matson on Ernie LaPointe, great-grandson of Sitting Bull, giving even further insights into the oral history of Sitting Bull's life.  Again in this DVD you will see beautiful wildlife footage.
Mr. LaPointe picks up where he left off at the end of the first DVD; back at Arrow Creek where Sitting Bull and his ""hostiles"" were camped short before the Battle of Greasy Grass (Little Big Horn).  The Lakota like other tribes were divided by the whites into two groups the ""friendlies"" (or ""hang around the fort"") and the ""hostiles"" those who refused to take handouts from the government agents.  After the battle, Sitting Bull and his followers fled to Canada in order to escape imprisonment, which was in the end inevitable.  McLaughlin, agent at Standing Rock, made Sitting Bull and his followers' lives miserable.  But Sitting Bull would not succumb to the white men's ways.  Through it all he had compassion for everyone, even for those who would soon kill him.  For the first time, the true murderer of Sitting Bull is identified.  In this DVD you will also meet Mr. LaPointe's sisters when the pair of leggings, which were taken off of Sitting Bull's dead body short after his murder, was repatriated to the family.
Still today, the family holds their great-grandfather in high esteem.",1252800000,2,1318,4.852678571428571
