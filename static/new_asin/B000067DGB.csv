7962595,5,B000067DGB,"Just beware, this is entirely in French.  No English subtitles.  Even the English-speaking interviews have been dubbed in French.  Luckily I'm learning French and this will also serve as a study aid.  I used to own the English-language version...until a friend lost it.  It's such a good program you might actually tear up at times.",1431475200,,332,4.963636363636364

7962600,5,B000067DGB,"First, I never get tired of watching this DVD set, and I must have viewed at least 10 times in its entirety.  The series is broken down by different points and times of hockey history . .The time when hockey was in its infancy and just getting started, to the time up to WW2.  After that, it goes up to the time of the last year of the Original 6, and then finally the post expansion period.  During each period, a number of hockey greats are interviewed for about a 3 to 5 minute clip on their formative years and hockey career.  By no means is each players' life and career a very detailed piece, but it is VERY entertaining nonetheless.  Hearing how Ted Lindsay, Glenn Hall and others grew up in that time period and sharing stories of the NHL in the 40's and 50's is VERY engaging and is a joy to watch.  The only complaint that I had with the DVD set is that for the period after the 67 expansion, I thought Bernie Parent should've been part of that group.  Bernie is omitted even in the second set (which is a drop down in enjoyment, but is not really a reflection of #2 as it is of the overall quality and production of the first set), and for someone who was very instrumental in two consecutive Stanley Cup championships, I thought it was kind of a big omission.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this series to anyone who is a hockey fan.  Top notch production, musical score and historical information can adequately describe this set.",1256256000,4,1443,4.354477611940299
7962601,5,B000067DGB,"When I first saw this series on ESPN years ago when I was in middle school, I've always wanted to find where to get it.  Thanks to Amazon, I am a very satisfied and extremely happy with my purchase.  This collection, season one and two, really brings you to understand how the game was formed and how players really affected the game we know today.  It is a must have for any hockey fan!",1190332800,9,387,4.202702702702703
