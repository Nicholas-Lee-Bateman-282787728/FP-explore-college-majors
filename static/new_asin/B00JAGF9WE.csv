8649441,4,B00JAGF9WE,"This is a very different film from director Pete Walker that is not a horror film at all. It concerns a twenty-something songwriter who picks up a girl and they make love, only for him to discover that she is only 14 years old. Her parents take him to court, but the songwriter and the underage teenage girl are actually very much in love. This late 70's British film also features Mick Jagger's son Chris and is an indictment on the court system and an awkward look at the 70's British music scene (some of the sequences are very wrong in their depiction of what British music was all about). If this were to happen in the U.S., the songwriter would be convicted on statutory rape (even if the sex was consensual) and would be a registered sex offender for the rest of his life, but things were quite different in the U.K. and other countries. A very unusual film from horror director Walker (FRIGHTMARE; HOUSE OF WHIPCORD; HOUSE OF MORTAL SIN; SCHIZO; THE COMEBACK) that is still very entertaining in its own way.",1410220800,4,1015,4.521739130434782
8649442,5,B00JAGF9WE,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE:  Many thanks for the prompt delivery of the above, was upset to find out that it does not work on my DVD player, after being told It would do so.. Is there anything I can do to rectify this? Perhaps there is a compatible copy I could purchase, one that will work in Australia.  Look forward to hearing from you..
