8258171,5,B0015ET40W,"I first saw Pavlo in a little restaurant in Birmingham Al. They were just passing through and stopped in to play. It was right after the release of His Fantasia cd. We were blown away. Since, I have introduced many people to them. I just got the Mediterranean Nights DVD. It is absolutely incredible. The talent, skill, and raw emotional. Unbelievable. It is truly a must see. Brian Richmond Virginia",1238198400,4,400,4.728571428571429
