8241406,5,B0011DCCBU,"I thought this was a great program. I love Jack Canfield's easy, confident style. He helps you see how you can put these principles into action and attract the life you want. He explains a number of powerful daily exercises you can use to create a more positive mental state. I really like the way he explains the science behind the law of attraction and gives lots of real world examples.",1362873600,,389,4.492957746478873
8241407,3,B0011DCCBU,"I ordered this dvd because I like Jack Canfield and his part in The Secret was one of the most appealing, in my opinion.
I was looking for something alse about the Secret and maybe with Jack Canfield when I found this DVD.
Well, english is not my mother tongue, but I could understand perfectly The Secret, but this dvd has a very bad audio and you have to pay all your attention to understand the words.
Other than this, I think the part with Jack Canfield is very interesting, but too short for what is proposed, and for such a high price. I bought thinking that I like Jack Canfield, but it disappointed me. When you see the menu, you have 1st part 55 minutes and 2nd part. Well, the second part has a few minutes with Jack and about 6 example videos regarding other 6 seminars in dvd, with other speakers, and cut in pieces, just to appeal to your interest. Pure advertising, I felt like being cheatted.",1211328000,7,907,4.341176470588235
