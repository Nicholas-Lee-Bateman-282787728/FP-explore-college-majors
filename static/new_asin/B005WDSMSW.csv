Will Crockett uses every day language to demystify photography terms so that everyone can understand it, young and old alike.

It is a great introduction and overview to using any digital camera, whether you are shooting a point and shoot or a DSLR, including post production and printing.  It explains the basics of how to set up your camera  and keep changing those basic settings to get a the photo you want.  It both shows and tells you had to take a photograph, the walk through the streets of New Orleans really demonstrates how one builds a photograph so you can go out and start taking amazing photos.

Even though this video is for the amateur, I think pros would grow as a photographer by watching this, it really goes into Will Crockett's way of thinking about photography on a personal personal level, how to grow our photography outside of client time, just to ride our passion.
