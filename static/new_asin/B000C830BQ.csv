8096230,5,B000C830BQ,"""Decision"" is not about a gunfight at sundown; Sundown is the name of a city where the man Randolph Scott wants to kill is living. Scott in this 1957 film plays a man who returned from the Civil war to his beautiful wife, but found that she was dead and had a romantic liaison with another man before she died. Scott is different in this role. The film is excellent; the best role that I think Scott played. He is a pathetic, hard-headed, overly resolved, man wanting revenge against the man who he is certain ravaged his wife and caused her death. He has a loyal sidekick who keeps trying to tell Scott something, but Scott refuses to listen. Scott has an opportunity to kill the man he is seeking but does not do it because of his system of ethics where he believes he must give his adversary warning, ""even a rattlesnake gives warning."" He does not always act reasonably. After threatening his adversary, he is surrounded in a shed with many men outside and with no chance of escaping from the shed. The people in Sundown are afraid of the man Scott wants to kill. They are very passive. He runs the town. The sheriff and his deputies are in his pay. They surround the shed.",1523836800,,1177,4.4036697247706424

8096234,1,B000C830BQ,"We truly love Westerns ... good Westerns, that is. Even Scott's so-so ""7 Men From Now"" is better than this terribly written, poorly directed (sorry, Budd) and stiffly acted Western. Dumb movies are OK only if they're intended to be dumb (think ""Young Frankenstein"" or ""Shanghai Noon""). This one is unintentionally stupid and, therefore, truly unwatchable. Wouldn't even have it on in the background during a dental cleaning. Yes, it really is that bad.",1391644800,,452,5.121621621621622
8096235,3,B000C830BQ,"Decision at Sundown, 1957 film

A man leaves a stagecoach and mounts a horse for his travel to the town of Sundown. He is looking for a man. [Revenge is his motive.] Bart wants a shave. Ruby plans to leave, and tells Tate why she will attend his wedding. Who else will attend Kimbrough's wedding? The tavern offers free drinks today. Is there any reason why this marriage should not occur? Bart asks Tate about a woman in another town. The two men take refuge in a stable. Lucy rides off, she avoids the marriage. The townsmen will support Tate against Bart. Men shoot at the stable after the two men refuse to surrender. The doctor enters to retrieve his satchel, and treats one wounded man. He warns against revenge.

Back at home Lucy talks to her Dad. Will Tate allow Bart to leave? One man offers a deal to Mr. Allison to leave town, $500 in cash. It is refused. Sam wonders if they should take the deal. Lucy asks Tate about Mary. He says he isn't a saint, she knew about Ruby. Lucy goes to the stable to talk to Bart Allison; Mary was his wife. Whose fault was it, asks Lucy. Sam tells Bart what he doesn't want to know. Sam leaves for the restaurant, then talks to the doctor. [This provides more background information.] As Sam walks away he is shot in the back! The Sheriff orders the people off the street. There is drama in the tavern. Whose town is it, asks the doctor? Who let them take over the town by doing nothing? [A reference to the 1950s?] The speech has an effect, some volunteer to even the odds. [Believable?] Morley's cowboys act.

The Sheriff walks toward Bart. One man is wounded, the other dead. Bart is treated by the doctor. Tate won't leave town, but the people no longer respect him. Have things changed? Tate straps on his gunbelt. Will he get lucky? Lucy tells Bart that Tate has lost everything (the support of the people). Tate walks toward Bart, a shot from Ruby fells Kimbrough! Later Tate and Ruby leave town in a buggy. Morley buys drinks for everyone, except Bart Allison. Later Bart rides off, The people won't forget what he did.

This story of a man seeking revenge seems to reference the politics of the 1950s. What if a man assumes power, then is shown to be a fraud? This exposure will free the people who were fooled by him. Does this still go on today? Read the newspapers and decide for yourself.",1375315200,,2346,4.4110854503464205
8096236,5,B000C830BQ,"I'm not really a Western person.  I think I preface most of my reviews on Western's with that statement.  I just have never really found them the most compelling genre, but I understand their appeal to many.  Still, in my attempt to see everything of note and merit, I have seen my fair share of Westerns.  In all honesty, I have to say that `Decision at Sundown' was one I wasn't at all anticipating and yet found very well constructed and much deeper than I expected.

With a complexity of storytelling that really embellished the film's themes, `Decision at Sundown' takes a familiar premise (that of a hatred fueled shootout) and infuses it with a backstory that feels very honest.  It allows for character development in a way that isn't overbearing but that is thoughtful and multi-faceted.

The performances are all rather good.  John Carroll is a supreme villain and works charisma into his stance, which only makes him all the more chilling, and Noah Beery Jr. is the perfect complement to the lead's tattered soul.  Randolph Scott plays that tattered soul with enough angst to make his backstory sing.  Some have balked that this doesn't answer questions soon enough, but by allowing us to contemplate the answers before they are given, `Decision at Sundown' offers the audience a rich resolve with a deeper impact.  With a dramatic and rapturous score and set pieces and costumes to die for, this is a Western I'm glad to have seen!",1369699200,3,1443,4.778225806451613
8096237,4,B000C830BQ,"A far more interesting and morally complex film than I expected after the first 15 minutes.

Randolph Scott stars as a cowboy come to take revenge on a man who wronged him, a man who is now the kingpin of the town of Sundown.
Sounds simple.  But all the characters reveal more layers than our first introductions lead us to expect, and issues of right and wrong end up
as more subjective and complex than we think of in most westerns.

Not quite a great movie - there are flaws; weak supporting performances, a misogynistic attitude, some unsuccessful comic relief,
some stretching of credulity, etc. But a movie that was much more memorable and grown-up than I had expected.",1351123200,2,675,4.65546218487395
8096238,2,B000C830BQ,"DECISION AT SUNDOWN (1957) is one of Randy Scott's last great westerns. I really wanted this tape, especially as it had a giveaway price, but unfortunately the maunufacturer is GOODTIMES.

They issued videos at slower tape speeds and without HiFi sound. Picture clarity of their product is always degraded, and unless your VCR's audio head is precisely aligned to GT's dubbing machines, the sound isn't all that clear either. Alas, alack and alarum!

Despite there being no other available tape of this movie,
my decision on GOODTIMES was.......... NO.",1280016000,,552,5.191011235955056
8096239,5,B000C830BQ,"One of a handful of remarkable Westerns made by the Ranown production team in the late 50's that established director Budd Boetticher as a master of the genre and Randolph Scott as an icon. All are small-scale, tightly witten, psychologically complex, and shine like polished nuggets. The least scenic of the brood, Decision nevertheless features some of the best one-liners of any Western, ( ""Back where I come from, folks don't  celebrate or make a big to-do when a man acts the way a man's supposed to act,"" snarls Scott's Bart Allison, surely one of the orneriest leads in all cowboydom). The plot itself concerns a revenge obsessed Allison upsetting Sundown's outward calm and toppling the town despot. It's fun to watch alliances rearrange among the shifty townspeople in response to the pig-headed Allison. Then too, suave bad-guy John Carroll more than matches mean-spirited good-guy Scott in the likability department, leaving the audience without the usual white-hat, black-hat stereotypes of the day. My one complaint: where was Boetticher when Vaughn Taylor ruins several barroom scenes with clownish overacting as the town drunk; for a filmmaker who so clearly understood that less often produces more, this seems a curious lapse. Anyway, the film can be enjoyed on its own, or as a step forward in the evolution of the Western before the Vietnam War and iconoclasm in general drove the species to extinction.",1132963200,15,1422,5.129310344827586
