8560380,5,B0043MMFN6,Excellent documentary about the prison rodeo system.  I liked how it followed a select few prison inmates and told their stories pre and post appearing in the rodeo.,1447545600,,165,4.892857142857143

8560382,4,B0043MMFN6,"Always interesting, sometimes moving, this is a documentary about the Oklahoma Prison Rodeo, and how women prisoners were
finally being allowed to take part.

It achieves a number of worthwhile things, among them introducing us to criminals so we come to see them as human beings
with hopes and dreams in an age where portraying all criminals as monsters is more the rule.  (Many of the women are in jail
for drug related offenses that took place when they were, by their own accounts, `young and stupid').

That said, the film also frustrated me.  Among the female prisoners, Beesley focuses his story almost exclusively on young,
very physically attractive white and Latina women.  Less attractive, or black female inmates, while glimpsed briefly, are
largely ignored This choice feels (perhaps unintentionally) sexist perhaps a bit racist as well.

Also, some darker aspects of this world are touched on, but not explored.  For example, the fact that Oklahoma has almost
twice the normal rate of women in prison.  Or the gladiatorial aspects of the rodeo.  I'm no expert on rodeos, but some of
the `sports', as in the one where a bull is set loose in a thick crowd of prisoners who try to pull a string from between it's
horns in hope of winning $100 - resulting in quite a number being thrown in the air on the bull's horns - doesn't seem
like anything I remember from regular rodeo.  It feels like something you watch to see people get hurt, not show off a
skill (as in bull or bronco riding).

By making these choices, and not asking more questions, I was left feeling a little disappointed in the film's lack of depth,
if still glad I'd seen it.",1330646400,,1652,4.681660899653979
8560383,5,B0043MMFN6,"We learn the stories of women who made bad choices but have not quit.  The Oklahoma prison decided to let the women inmates participate in one of the two prison rodeos left in the US.  The women are realistic about their lives and Beesley was granted more access than I would have thought possible. I use it in my Freshman English classes when we study documentaries and the students love the stories of Crystal, Jamie, Rhonda, Danny, and Foxie. Most people don't see behind prison walls and while this is not an in your face movie my friends, family, and students who have seen this develop a greater understanding of privacy, loss, but most of all freedom in its many aspects.",1304035200,,678,4.595041322314049
