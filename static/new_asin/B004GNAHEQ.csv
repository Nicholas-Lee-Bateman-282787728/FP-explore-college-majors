8428865,5,B004GNAHEQ,"I've been late so many times waiting for my girlfriend to ""get her makeup just right,"" that I finally decided to get this DVD.  I gave it to her as a Bday present, knowing I was walking on thin ice (will she like it and be thankful?  or pop my eyes out with the end of her brush)  To my great joy, not only did she appreciate it, but she raved about how it ""unlocked secrets of layering and shading,"" and broke down a step by step progression that showed exactly how to achieve those looks.  She particularly liked the peacock look, and rainbow eye. All this, and i'm late far less often than before.  Win.",1333411200,2,606,4.189655172413793
8428866,5,B004GNAHEQ,"I finally found a video that helps me achieve the look that i have been desperately trying to get when it comes to my eyes ! It shows you how to make your eyes pop without having to use too much make up, and when I looked at myself in the mirror I was really happy with the way my eyes looked. I will be recommending this video to my sister and my friends, and I am sure they will love it as much as I do !",1307577600,,406,3.625

8428868,5,B004GNAHEQ,"I suppose I am at a loss for words.....an individual as prolific and often referred to as a modern day Renaissance Man, I have but few words that could shine in the true light of Danica's inherent talent.  I say inherent, only because, just as all art, it must flow from within.....and quite simply, her hands, are that of an artist, moving about her canvas, and with each brush stroke, the colors of beauty evolve.....In this DVD, Danica embarks on my favorite feature on a lady's visage.  The eyes.  Her proper use of foundation, makeup, and eyelashes to complete the look is a testament to the level at which she has perfected her art.  All 6 looks are unique and quite amazing.  Danica is truly the makeup artist to learn your techniques from.  Her soothing voice is as sweet as she is a human being.....

Nothing I say should convince you other than the fact that she deserves every accolade for her talents in the line of cosmetic makeup mastery........",1295395200,,959,4.605882352941176
