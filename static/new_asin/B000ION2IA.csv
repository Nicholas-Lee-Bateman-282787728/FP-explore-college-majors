2659649,5,B000ION2IA,"Lately, there has been a shortage of really great B horror movies on the market. Most of the direct to DVD horror has been boring or poorly made. Therefore, I wasn't expecting a lot when I got Wedding Slashers. However, I was pleasantly surpised by one of the BEST B horror movies of all time. Then again, it's not that fair to say best B horror movies, since this is also better than most of what's been in the theater, too.

The movie starts off with a bloody double killing in the first six minutes, and the gory thrill ride never lets up from there. All 80 minutes of this movie are packed with brutal murder, fun plot twists, and snappy dialogue. The characters are `real' fleshed out enough that by the end of the film you feel connected to them in a way. The writing and directing are brilliant. I can't say enough nice things about how well this was made on a small budget.

The plot, without giving too much away, surrounds the pain and loss one girl, Jenna, has in her life. Death surrounds her, so it's no surprise when her wedding turns into a murderfest. The reason why is the twist, and I don't want to be the one to spoil that for you, the viewer.

Look, you can see my other reviews and tell, I'm pretty honest. If a movie sucks, I'll say so. But Wedding Slashers is the surprise smash hit of the year and a must have for anyone who likes horror, especially horror with humor and bite.

HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS.",1169856000,4,1427,4.333333333333333
2659650,1,B000ION2IA,"Apparently the producers had to save up their allowances for three whole months (!) to get together enough money to pay crappy actors to spend a day away from their jobs at Wal-Mart; apparently purchased a home video camera (wqhich they probably returned the next day for a refund); and convinced one of their 8-year-old brothers to ""write"" a ""script"". People, this one isn't even worth a $4 video rental... you'd get better entertainment value by sticking your finger down a drunk buddy's throat and watching them vomit.",1165536000,2,521,4.931818181818182
2659651,1,B000ION2IA,"I have a pretty flexible attitude when it comes to gore and/or sexual aberrations, but WEDDING SLASHERS pushes the limit.  The tale of a young woman whose boyfriends end up dying horrible deaths at the hands of her multiply inbred family is ridiculously scripted and the acting is non-existent.  The only ""name"" actor in the cast is Richard Lynch, who doesn't come in until close to the end as the potential bride's father.  The movie treats its killings sadistically and there are characters in the movie who we never know who they are.  A really bad and not one of those cheesy bad movies.  Don't get engaged in this one folks.",1164326400,2,629,4.63063063063063
2659652,5,B000ION2IA,"Wedding Slashers does a great job of satisfying the ever-hungry Horror Crowd's appetite.  If you are looking for insatiable gore and evil blood thirsty villians with names like ""Sock Monkey"" and ""The Executioner,"" then you're in luck.  Wedding Slashers promises to shock and startle you from beginning to end - and pulling a page from 'Shaun of the Dead' - there are just as many scares as there are laughable one-liners.

Word of advise - not for those who are weak in the stomach.

Enjoy!",1162166400,3,490,4.729411764705882
8146725,1,B000ION2IA,"This was the worst movie I have ever dared watch. It was supposed to be a horror comedy with dark comedy, but someone wanted them to completely change it to be a straight faced horror movie. The tragedy that came out of editing was Wedding Slashers. This was so bad that I would rather watch Birddemic. And that is saying something.

Basically, the dark comedy that it WAS going to be would have been much better than the finished product. It was stupid, the plot was idiotic, the twists were even worse, and the acting was ATROCIOUS. Seriously, Mars of Destruction was better. MARS OF DESTRUCTION.

Bottom line, DON'T judge a movie by its cover. You will regret it.",1450137600,,666,4.588235294117647
8146726,2,B000ION2IA,"About the only thing that Wedding Slashers (2006) has going for it, is a propensity for gore, particularly violence directed at the head.  The special effects aren't exactly outstanding, and after a while, the unconvincingly executed decapitations, and other acts of violence, aren't enough to hold your attention.

The muddled story involving a woman named Jenna (Jessica Kinney), and her homicidal family, isn't presented in a very coherent way, and fails to make a solid emotional connection.  Apparently intended as a horror/comedy, the comedic elements are mostly a miss, as the characters mostly come off as idiots, who head directly into the path of danger.  The writing and dialog, lacks any cleverness, and the acting is subpar even for a low budget horror film.  Despite a substantial amount of gore, Wedding Slashers is more annoying than scary.  If you can catch it for free streaming somewhere, it might be worth a look, but otherwise this would be one to avoid.",1384128000,,975,5.0625
8146727,2,B000ION2IA,"This film could have been titled ""Kentucky Chainsaw Massacre."" The film opens up 40 years ago with a couple eloping to Las Vegas. Along the way the car he just spent his last dime on, breaks down. The mechanic claims, ""it was tampered with"" a key plot point. Needless to say the couple doesn't make it. We jump to five years ago with Jenna (Jessica Kinney) eloping with her boyfriend. They don't make it. During some counseling with a creepy looking priest shrink, Jenna reveals she comes from an over protective family as Scooby-Doo puts the pieces together. She is now engaged to Alex (Ross Kelly) with her family on the way...

This is a substandard 80's style slasher film. It has plenty of blood, gore and severed body parts, it just doesn't do it well. It has given us quantity and sacrificed quality. There is some minor camp value to the film as the acting is noticeably bad and one camera shot had something on the lens in the upper right corner. Minor humor. For 80's slasher fans it might be worth a peek if the film was cheap enough. This is the type of film that become part of those horror 8 packs.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, lap dance, near sex, nudity (Thank you Tanith Fiedler, plus strippers)",1361145600,,1208,4.511415525114155

8146729,5,B000ION2IA,For this movie being a independant film it is pretty good. the story was great the actors were great and the director did an awesome job. i love B-rated horror films. some are good and some aren't. this one was pretty good. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do.,1301529600,,285,4.2
8146730,4,B000ION2IA,"A couple is running away and getting married. They have car trouble and out of nowehre, a mechanic appears and tows them to his place. Then some pyscho kills off the couple and credits roll. I will say the ladies death is probably the greatest straight to dvd horror kill of all time, i've never seen any better.

The basic plot is a girl wants to get married but her family won't let her because she is suppose to marry her cousin. They kill off memebers of the wedding and I must say most the kills do look good. The last half hour was turned into one big comedy but it was funny and I did laugh. The killers are the worst since the horror remake of Prom Night. It's probably the only thing that brings down the movie. However, for three bucks it's a great buy and a great addition to any horror collection.",1298678400,,809,4.219354838709678
8146731,1,B000ION2IA,"and the fact that I wasted my time watching this awful excuse for a movie. The plot (if you could call it that) was full of holes, and takes bits and pieces from other bad horror movies. The ""acting"" was a joke, and had me laughing at times I should have been cringing. The clothes...of I could go on, but take my word for it, this is a D movie, and I have to wonder at the 5 stars, and would bet that they are connected or related to someone who is, to this movie. That's the only logical explaination, please save your money on this one!!!!",1231027200,,542,4.074766355140187
8146732,5,B000ION2IA,"First off, I just want to make it clear that I enjoy this movie very much. I have seen it 4 times. You have to be crazy to think this will be some $100 million Hollywood feature. The point of watching a movie is to be entertained, and if your not entertained by Wedding Slashers, you obviously don't have a sense of humor. Technically it's supposed to be a horror movie, but I would classify it as more of a comedy. Most of the acting is so-so, but Jessica Kinney carries this movie pretty well. If you want a good laugh, and the opportunity to hear some of the most memorable and hilarious movie lines in history, Wedding Slashers is perfect. And you probably won't spend more than $5.00 with shipping for the movie. You have nothing to lose I promise.",1223164800,,753,4.347517730496454
8146733,1,B000ION2IA,"I saw Wedding Slashers at a local video store that was going out of business and selling all their stock. With the title and cover, it looked like it would be a good bad movie: cheesy, stupid, and fun to watch. And it was -- except for the ""fun"".

It's hard to describe just how terrible it is. The story makes little sense, even after all the twists are ""explained"". Nothing any character does seems motivated, despite the fact that the characters sometimes inexplicably explain their motivations out loud. The story behind the villains is completely ridiculous and unbelievable. And every aspect of the production -- writing, acting, even lighting -- is uniformly incompetent. I have seen better production values in community college student works (I'm not kidding about that!).

For some reason, people seem to praise the scenes where the villains ramble about a bunch of irrelevant nonsense in some horrible misguided attempt at comedy. None of these scenes (and there are several) actually have anything funny happen in them, they serve no purpose in the story, and ultimately they just waste time. And it's pretty sad that an 80-minute movie feels so long.

If you're looking at this movie, you're either expecting it to be good and scary or bad and funny. Either way, you will be horribly disappointed. Avoid it.",1200355200,3,1320,4.910313901345291
8146734,1,B000ION2IA,"Neither Mary nor her little lamb could save this movie, nor would they want to see it. The actors and actress' are uninspired, armature, and emotionless. The plot is horrible and the direction is the equivalent of a home movie. Do not rent this film unless you're looking for a chuckle at some extremely and overdramatic gore.

However, the films first couple of minutes follow the lives of a couple just married. The acting and plot in this portion of the film is tolerable and even a bit entertaining. The problem with this is, its basically just a scary opener rather than an opener to the plotline itself. Beyond these first three minutes of film, ""Wedding Slashers"" is a piece of rotten cake.

Note: I never rate anything one or two stars. Everything has its faults, but this is beyond bearable. A usually easy pleaser has been dissatisfied.",1178150400,,846,4.70945945945946
