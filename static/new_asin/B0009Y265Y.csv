8070141,1,B0009Y265Y,"Horribly produced, and not at all funny, attempt at a stand up show. The jokes are lame, and the cut away scenes are annoying.. It looks like a poorly produced cable access program from the 90's, and even though the women are holding a microphone, the audio is lousy and sounds strained and fades in and out.

I knew this was going to be lousy because only one person that was recognizable: Lisa Ann Walter, from a bunch of failed tv sitcoms and some average to forgettable movies (Jack and Kill, War of the Worlds, Shall We Dance, Bruce Almighty, etc.). Filmed (if you want to use that term) in 2004,  I think she's the only one who is still around (working) today.. She is showcased last, and for the entire final 30 minutes of this 90 minute show; although I have a feeling that most have turned it off long before.. Even her performance is below average; It's more like a sad bitter anti- Hollywood and anti everyone rant about why she's not more famous than she really is. The bad shirtless dancers in the Matrix coats was also a poorly thought out (and executed) idea. In the end credits there's a guy and moments to suggest that this had a script and they were rehearsing .. Now that was funny, because this whole thing was horrible. There's nothing to see here - avoid this whole convoluted mess that never should have been made.

I had received this DVD for free (new), and I still feel ripped off and like I lost money.",1409443200,,1429,4.40530303030303

8070143,1,B0009Y265Y,"These women aren't funny.  Obviously, they seem to think that they need to have garbage mouths in order to be ""naughty"".  You can be naughty and funny without using ""F"" every-other-word.  And shimmying the body parts isn't necessary, either.  I don't mind language (love Robin Williams) as long as it accompanies funny.  This DVD is a waste of money.",1234396800,3,350,4.864406779661017
8070144,2,B0009Y265Y,"In this poor excuse for a comedy DVD, 6 no-name female ""comics"" stumble over poor writing, poor delivery, and general awkwardness on stage. Watching this trash felt like rubbernecking a car accident on the freeway. The audience isn't into the material, and no one looks happy to be there. Only buy this if you like watching comics bomb for over an hour.",1224028800,7,353,4.709677419354839
