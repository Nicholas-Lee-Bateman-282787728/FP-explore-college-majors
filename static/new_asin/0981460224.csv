174224,5,0981460224,"If you want to learn how to actually make great things happen in your life, as promised by The Secret, start with Neville Goddard's book 'The Law and the Promise'. Then turn to Mike Dooley's book 'Infinite Possibilities'. And then finish with this video which gives a very simple system that will lead to manifesting your desires. It all started with Neville and Dooley does the best job of bringing his ideas alive. Not that Neville needs much help, but I always enjoy a good video to enhance a book. Dooley is a great guy to listen to - full of enthusiasm and humor. It's 75 minutes long, you'll love it.",1356134400,18,606,4.468468468468468

174228,5,0981460224,"I bought this DVD as a gift for my husband's birthday. Coincidentally we watched it last night and we loved it. It was clear and to the point with good examples, and great tips. We will definitely watch it again and put it into practice. This is a down-to-earth version of ""the secret.""

174229,2,0981460224,"I was expecting more deep information; more illustrations with more actors; for the price my expectations were too high. I really was thinking about be the second part of The Secret ""Law of Attraction"". I bought 2 for a gift in Christmas, and the other person didn't say a word, means she didn't like either.",1263859200,2,308,4.618181818181818
174230,5,0981460224,"Although Mike Dooley's appearance was brief in the Secret DVD, he made a major impression on me. Subsequently, I've become a member of his website ... [...] ... and now receive an email Mon-Fri, called Notes from the Universe and have purchased his books and CDs. With this in mind, I was excited to learn that he had produced his first DVD ... Thoughts Become Things ... and purchased it immediately. I received it yesterday, watched it today with my husband, and was more than happy with the production and message.

The thing I really like about Mike Dooley is how down to earth he is ... very real and approachable ... and his message, easy to understand and to apply. The same can be said with this DVD. The production features, Mike, primarily speaking directly to the viewer, along with visual examples (actors) or illustrations of each message (lesson) he's discussing ... all filled with humor, and presented in a self-deprecating, and non-flashy manner. Watch it from start to finish for a complete overview, and after that, watch just the chapter you feel you need a refresher course on, or whenever you need a little lift or nudge in the right direction.

This DVD is perfect for the beginner explorer who is discovering the art of creating their own best reality for the first time ... or, for those well versed in the concepts, but who enjoy, or prefer to get their information visually and are always happy to supplement their metaphysical library. I can recommend this DVD highly and have purchased three more DVDs for Christmas gifts for family and friends. I'm sure you'll feel the same way, too. Jambo!",1260576000,46,1621,4.74468085106383

174266,4,0981460224,"There is some redundancy and about halfway through you get tired of just watching Mike Dooley speak in front of a photo backdrop, but the message helps and motivates anyone. My teenage daughter was in the room while I was watching, apparently watching/listening also, and she loved it. The idea of quantum affirmations really stuck with her. She was repeating his words long after and has adopted more positive thinking so it works.",1396915200,7,432,4.931506849315069
174267,4,0981460224,"Mike Dooley is a good speaker, very believable. This is another film about working with the mind to better your life. I strongly believe that our minds are the key to a better life and that we can do more to enhance our experiences. I think we are to help one another and to enjoy the abundance all around us and we do that by really tuning in to what we think and feel. I find that when negative thoughts pop up, with the help of this film and others done about ""The Secret"", I'm able to control those thoughts and turn them into good. I feel better and enjoy more.",1396569600,,566,4.108108108108108
174268,5,0981460224,"If you are intrigued by the title, so was I. Thoughts become things means if you think a certain way everyday, you will believe it and then actual events will occur in your life that reflect what you believe. Of course, the implication underlying the title is that if you think negatively, then negative things will occur. But also if you think positively, those things will manifest themselves in your life too. In short, notice what you are thinking. That is the key, awareness. Once you become aware of your thinking, then you can do something about it.",1396396800,5,556,4.683673469387755

174273,4,0981460224,"This is kind of like the movie ""The Secret"", but instead of having many authorities on the law of attraction, there's just one - Mike.  His rise to success is interesting.  There's nothing groundbreaking, but I did enjoy his story.",1391990400,3,231,4.75

174278,4,0981460224,"This is a short video that is the basic,, in a nutshell version of the book. It is excellent in that it is very direct and clear in its explanations and examples.

The main thing I don't like about this video is that it is highly one-sided as far as the audience it is directed to. According the the actors or people in the video, only while, young, and wealthy people should watch this because that is all you see.

If the producers really wanted to spread the work and improve people's lives and the world, then they should have more variety in the video. Yes I know you can argue that only the privileged white people will buy this, but that is not what the material is aimed at - it appears, anyway.

Overall, the information is great, the production is lacking.",1386115200,,766,4.3426573426573425
174279,5,0981460224,"Great video for those seeking spiritual awakening. This is a good video, but a little repetitious after seeing the Secret. Still a good addition to self help teachings.",1384387200,,168,5.035714285714286
