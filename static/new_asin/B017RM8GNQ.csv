7512669,5,B017RM8GNQ,Probably the best series I have ever watched. The storyline flows well and the cast is awesome. Will watch over and over again.,1494547200,2,127,4.565217391304348
7512670,5,B017RM8GNQ,"I was so excited to get my series I had to watch it right away. Great quality, and awesome series. I'm a little bummed S5V2 isn't included but other than that no problems.",1493510400,5,171,4.212121212121212
7512671,5,B017RM8GNQ,"The SyFy Channel once again cancelled a beloved show with a huge fan following because...well, they tend to
dump the good shows and keep the lame ones on..........but this series is one of the best they've every had
on their network.  I'm been watching the channel since day one and Haven is one of those special shows where
the writing, acting, directing, sets (location), props...you name it.........they ALL mesh together so brilliantly and beautifully
that you want to watch and re-watch it over and over again.  I only wish a streaming service (perhaps Amazon) would pick
it up and continue with it.  Five seasons wasn't long enough and the concept was so memorable that you just KNEW you
could get another 5 seasons out of it.  Plus it's hard to say goodbye to these magnificent actors.  I know we'll see them in future
projects but they will always be our beloved Haven residents and treat yourself to any and ALL of these DVDs or streaming for this
show................you won't regret it.  IT'S THAT GOOD!!!",1453939200,3,1016,4.810344827586207

7512675,3,B017RM8GNQ,"I love this series, but was disappointed that the 2nd 1/2 of the 5th season was not included and has to be purchased separately.  It was a great price for as many dvd's that are included.
The description was not clear so make sure you read reviews before purchasing.",1507075200,4,266,4.428571428571429

7512678,4,B017RM8GNQ,"I found this series when Netflix offered it to stream for free.  I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to buy the DVDs so that I could listen to the commentaries.  Unfortunately, one of the Season 2 disks wouldn't load.  I bought a replacement Season 2 and the same disk was defective.  Amazon gave me a refund, but it's frustrating when there's clearly a manufacturing defect that's not addressed by the manufacturer.",1500681600,,415,4.6438356164383565

7512680,5,B017RM8GNQ,"This is an excellent sci fi series. I first started watching Haven when Hulu was still free. The packaging is very good, and the shipping was quick. Be aware that season 5 vol 2 is not included in this series. I would recommend this to a friend.",1498003200,2,245,4.23404255319149
7512681,2,B017RM8GNQ,"The title of this product clearly says ""complete series"". Beware, it is NOT complete. Good price at $34.99, but it is deceiving and should not say ""Complete Series"" in the title.  EDIT: Season 5, Part/Volume 2 is missing.",1497571200,15,221,4.815789473684211

8740038,5,B017RM8GNQ,It looks nice and is so sturdy.  Just love the feel of it and how easy to hold it.  The little stand is nice so it can sit without holding onto it!,1516924800,,147,3.5625
