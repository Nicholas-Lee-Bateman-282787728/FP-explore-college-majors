1194503,5,B000006GE5,"Praise from a flatfoot detective towards conductor Rex Harrison. Nope I won't tell you which scene, they're ALL great. From Harrison's blowup at his brother in law Rudy Vallee to his growing jelousy towards his wife, which culminate in a series of hysterically funny revenge fantaies. This film is laugh out loud all the way. It's Preston Sturges at his best. The comic genius that brought us Mad Wednesday, Hail The Conquering Hero , Sullivan's Travels, etc.
No director has ever surpassed him. Lubitsch and Wilder matched him. As did Chaplin and  Woody Allen, who also starred in their own films. But for sheer wit and nuttyness of plot combined with spectaular dialogue Preston is it. Try topping the last line of the film which a repentant Harrison delivers to his wife ashe takes her in his arms: 'A thousand poets dreamt for a thousand years--and you were born. . . my love'
Enjoy.",1067040000,10,887,4.759740259740259
1194504,5,B000006GE5,"Only The Lady Eve forces me to edge this movie out of number-one spot among Preston Sturges' comedies.  The dialogue is snappy as ever (Doltish husband: ""Too much temperament! Give me the simple viewpoint!""  His wisecracking wife: ""You've got it, kid. You don't have to yearn for it."") but the slapstick of the finale is cleverer by far than any in his other movies.  The use of music is inspired, both in Harrison's concert revenge-fantasies and in his later attempts to put them into action, when the music is spiked with comic effects.  A little slow to get started, this movie soon enough develops a quirky, unpredictable, and completely fascinating story line. Don't deprive yourself of seeing this!",1008201600,23,704,4.940677966101695
1194505,5,B000006GE5,"This is the 5th (and last) of Sturges' truly inspired comedies (the others being ""Hail the Conquering Hero"", ""Miracle of Morgan's Creek"", ""The Lady Eve"", and ""The Palm Beach Story"") and its failure at the box office is probably why it was the last. I find it incomprehensible that it failed -- it starts a little slowly, perhaps (although I actually quite like the beginning), but the last 30-45 minutes (after the concert) is just heaven. Basically the movie is a slapstick comedy, but surely the most sophisticated slapstick comedy ever, and what I find astonishing is how perfectly cast Rex Harrison turned out to be in a pratfalling role (?!?!?!?). My kids and I laugh out loud just thinking about the scenes in this movie, must less watching it. If you haven't seen this movie and ever liked ANY movie made before 1950, you should watch it. It really is fun for the entire family, and belongs in any video collection.",998611200,28,922,4.697530864197531
1194506,5,B000006GE5,"Rex Harrison plotting murder! I never would have believed it! And to try to murder such a sweet girl as Linda Darnell seems utterly ridiculous!  This movie was an absolute classic! I found it really interesting that he plotted out how to deal with his wife's infedelity while he conducted an orchestra. The things he plotted, though, were somewhat gruesome to watch, I must say. However, I have to say that the scenes in which Rex's character was trying to carry out his terrible scheme were very funny, and delightful to watch. I laughed until I cried when he was dealing with the irksome cane-bottom chairs. It isn't any wonder why his wife was so bewildered.  I have to say that this is one of the funniest Rex Harrison movies I have ever seen and can readily suggest it to anyone who is up to a good laugh.",980640000,9,810,4.466216216216216
1194507,5,B000006GE5,"In hindsight, Paramount's decision to terminate their relationship with Preston Sturges occupies the region between 'insane', 'irresponsible' and that old standby, 'stupid'. Sturges' subsequent relocation to Fox was, of course, utterly disastrous; which makes UNFAITHFULLY YOURS as much a miracle as it is a great comedy. His stock company (save for a very funny Rudy Vallee) was now a thing of the past; although the cast he assembled here is game and lively, Edgar Kennedy foremost among them. Nevertheless, UNFAITHFULLY YOURS is Sturges' second consecutive attempt (after MAD WEDNESDAY) to move away from his trademark of the inspired dialogue-comedy and towards a more visual (or in this case, audio-visual) farce. Fortunately for us, he succeeded brilliantly (not that it cut him any ice in an increasingly desperate studio-system that not only didn't know what to do with its few geniuses but began to openly despise them). Rex Harrison plays a vain, high-strung symphony conductor who -thanks inadvertantly to his cuckold of a brother in law (Vallee, naturally)- begins to suspect his wife of having an affair. What follows is an amazingly supple and creative variation of the boudoir-farce, highlighted by the famous virtuoso segments in which Harrison daydreams of killing her to the strains of Rossini, Wagner & Tchaikovsky, as well as the classic finale where cold-bloodedness and high culture both are reduced to slapstick bumbling (silent comedy, always near & dear to Sturges' heart, is a definite influence here). Ignored on its release, UNFAITHFULLY YOURS, combining as it does comedic disciplines of music, dialogue and sight-gags, has since been elevated to its rightful position as a masterwork. Unfortunately, this re-evaluation came too late to rescue Preston Sturges from the personal and professional oblivion the know-nothings (in and out of Hollywood) were remorselessly consigning him to. See this movie and help redress this outrage.",972172800,63,1960,5.4506578947368425
1194508,4,B000006GE5,"This a film in the classic rip-off Hitchcock style.  Combining Macabre humour and suspense, it carries through to the end with turns and twists to entertain anyone.

1194559,5,B000006GE5,This is an underrated film.  Everyone in it is excellent --- including Rudy Vallee -- and the story line is so funny.  It it a far superior version to the one made years later with Dudley Moore.,1472947200,,194,4.216216216216216
1194560,3,B000006GE5,"Those readers familiar with my music, book and film reviews in this space know that when I come across musicians, authors and movies that I go crazy over I tend to go out and grab every available other piece of material done by them. So in a short period of time, for example, you would get maybe ten reviews running of the legendary hard-boiled detection writer Dashiell Hammetts work (and maybe more for older work as some previously unknown work like some of Hammetts very early writing see the light of day whether they should have or not). Right now I am hot on the trail of the king of the 1930s and 1940s romantic screwball comedy writers and directors Preston Sturges after having viewed his classic Sullivans Travels with Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake (she of that then 1940s fashionable tuff of hair hanging over the right eye). The film under review, Unfaithfully Yours, and as time goes on will be true of other Sturges efforts, not in the same league as the formerly mentioned film, had a fine performance by lead actor Rex Harrison and enough subtle and witty dialogue to, well, fill a concert hall.

That concert hall reference is no accidental remark since this film centers on the ups and downs of a world famous English conductor, Sir Alfred, played with dry wit by Mister Harrison who having arrived back in the States after a tour of his native England is given confidential information that his much younger wife, Daphne, played by Linda Darnell, has been having an affair with his younger male secretary. Of course the theme of the older man-younger women, the theme of intergenerational sex to put it plainly, has a long history, a long history of suspicion and wonder, wonder on the part of the older man about whether he can keep up with the younger set. Whether a younger man will cut his time. That situation is the case here as well. The twist: the information gathered by Sir Alfreds brother-in-law who was married to Daphnes sister gathered by a hired private investigator was erroneous, had been based on appearances being deceiving information a well-worn literary and cinematic trick to move a plot along. The rest of the story hinges on resolving the how and what to do about the situation with that wrong information.

Despite the erroneous information at the time before discovery of the real facts, despite all good sense, Sir Alfred began to believe the allegations against his unfaithful wife. Began to let that affect his conducting as well since his choice of musical performances for an upcoming important concert would descend into three separate pieces reflecting three separate ways in which he could resolve his problem. Three fantastic ways. The first one obviously a frame up murder which was plotted with the idea of letting the male secretary take the fall-and take the big step off as well. The second involved the modern concept being a man of the world, of letting fate take its course and wishing the couple well with a big check to keep them in the style Daphne had become accustomed to. Third, a theatrical act of despair at a world not worth living in without his Daphne and a bout of suicide via Russian roulette.

But hold on a minute this is after all a romantic comedy, a black romantic comedy, a Sturges black comedy to boot, and so as Sir Alfred tried to really do Daphne in he is so incompetent that the whole thing turns into a comedy of errors, all three ways out of his dilemma way beyond his powers of commission, before he is told the error of his ways. That was how the deal went down, a little sophomoric, but the Sturges dialogue and clever interweaving of arcane social commentary make this one worth a watch if you cant get hold of Sullivans Travels as a primer.",1459641600,,3736,4.657575757575757

1194562,4,B000006GE5,"This movie is one of Preston Sturges' very best for comedy, timing, and acting. I stumbled across the movie quite by accident once while on vacation, laughed like a fool through it, and ended up ordering a copy for my VHS player.  Well, the player is long gone, and I wanted a DVD.  Now I have it.

Sir Alfred DeCarter (Harrison), a famous musical conductor, returns home after being away.  He is greeted by his loving wife (deliciously portrayed by Linda Darnell) and his friends, including his brother-in-law (Rudy Vallee).  In a scene in which he nearly stole the show, Rudy Vallee reports to Harrison that he had taken seriously Harrison's request that he 'Keep an eye on my wife!' and had hired a detective to follow her around.  And he presents the report, which he says has some indication of indiscretion.  Harrison rejects the report, orders Vallee out of there, and then angrily goes to visit the detective, who gives him the report.

The rest of the movie follows Harrison as he conducts the evening's concert, all the while veering between rage at his wife's supposed infidelity, confidence in her love for him, and noble forgiveness in a series of fantasies.  It's a very enjoyable movie.  I understand it was thought to have done poorly because of a scandal involving Rex Harrison, who left his wife for another woman.  I suspect the explanation was the fact that for about a third of the movie Harrison is fantasizing about murdering his wife.

But truth comes out, true love wins, the kerfuffle is explained, and the laughs die down.  The comedy is delicious.",1452729600,,1575,4.7463235294117645

1194565,4,B000006GE5,"Bear with me.

I know this is a really borderline film but I believe it should be discussed here.
There is nothing truly fantastic here, but there is quite a bit of crossover with stories lines and themes from The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947),  Ensayo de un crimen/La vida criminal de Archibaldo de la Cruz (1955), or even The Daydreamer (1966) and Divorce, Italian Style (1961) Divorzio all'italiana with touches of Fantasia (1940)
Preston Sturges is no Buuel (even if we do get a single surrealistic spinning whirlpool image, we also see the fantasy sequences by travelling into the characters head via his left eyes pupil,) but there should always be room here for the story of a man who daydreams about committing (a perfectly realized) murder, and then proceeds to (ineptly) attempt it, only to give up at the end.

The visualization of the murder is suitably disturbing and the details gruesome, if bloodless, as suits an admittedly black comedy of the time. If you really wanted to alienate general audiences nowadays you could easily pile on the grue and juices, and take it to a totally different (and still valid) direction.

Rex Harrison is excellent as an intense, temperamental conductor, but not as successful in the pratfall portion, which goes to show that very particular talents are required for physical comedy. As a result the slapstick routines seem a tad repetitive and go on  for just a bit too long. I can picture slapstick by Buster Keaton doing wonders with the role (with other direction by Buuel!)

The movie works as an exploration of the dark side of the artistic temperament, not quite the tragedy of Othello, but certainly something that would appeal to our inner John Waters: How long before this guy snaps and actually kills someone?..

The basic point of the movie is that artists feel more intensely (than us regular shlubs) and project those feelings to us thru their artistic work. The movie does that well in the theater scenes, but it also provokes feelings of resentment of artists by the added implications, (our figures of identification are either the adoring fans of this a-hole or the unpoetical, unromantic, tight-wadded, philistine cuckold,) which may explain the publics rejection of the movie at the time of its release.

The movie is a Tarantino favorite and was remade with Dudley Moore.",1446422400,,2345,4.904040404040404

1194592,4,B000006GE5,"""Unfaithfully Yours"" is a sophisticated, witty and black comedy written and directed by the great Preston Sturges. The reviews on Amazon indicate that it is not to everyone's taste. The script is brilliant satire but my reservation is with the leads. Rex Harrison was often an unsympathetic actor and while he is perfect as the egotistical maestro, he lacks the warmth which would make the maestro just a little bit likeable. It is this lack of sympathy which may have prompted the public's reaction because this film was not a box office success on its original release; not the least reason would have been that Harrison was involved in a messy scandal at the time. Linda Darnell plays his wife but the part does not lend itself to any great acting though she looks great.

The real reason for buying this DVD is that it has been given the Criterion treatment. That means there are some worthwhile extras and the print is outstanding. By far the best of these is the interview with Sandy Sturges, the director's widow.  She is a charming woman and her comments are sharp. For example, in reference to Darnell's performance, she simply said she followed directions which perfectly summarises the adequacy of the performance but with no suggestion of any originality or individualism on the actress's part.

The commentary is only fair. There are 3 commentators and Diane Jacobs, in particular, is shrill, and disagrees with her colleagues on a number of points which only serves to confuse the listener. It would have been better if they had worked out their differences before making the commentary. The Introduction by Terry Jones is pointless but harmless. The Theatrical Trailer is included and indicates that the film was marketed almost as a film noir, which it is not. Finally, an enlightening essay is included in the sleeve of the DVD case.",1391212800,,1850,4.885350318471337

The movie is well worth it, the Cinema Archives edition transfer is a little faulty.  The story about a conductor who receives information that his wife has been unfaithful to him, and imagines three instances while conducting of disposing of her and then, after the performance, goes about actually doing what he had imagined and of course, nothing goes as it should.  The film is very accomplished technically, the script and direction and performances all excellent.

1194627,3,B000006GE5,"Although I am a big fan of Sturges' films, both the ones he directed and the ones where he was the credited writer, I had never seen Unfaithfully Yours. I knew that it had only mixed reviews upon original release and was never considered one of his better films; at least not a successful one, which might be why I have skipped it all these years. But after seeing some of the Amazon reviews for the Criterion version, and at a discounted price, I figured it was worth a purchase.
So I bought the film, and while I think the film is worth seeing (at least for the cost of Amazon Instant Video), I was only modestly impressed with this movie.

Compared to Sturges' previous films and other great screwball-type comedies, the film is just mildly entertaining. As with many screwball comedies, the story starts with some small misunderstanding that snowballs into larger misunderstandings, in this case a vague report on his wife's activities in a hotel  lead  a husband to believe his wife is unfaithful. Very simple premise for the story, but with Sturges adding the clever plot device of flash-forward imagining on the husband's part( Rex Harrison imagining catching and punishing his wife for her infidelity). Plus we have the husband character being a renowned classical music conductor and Sturges use of the music to liven up the film score.

Throw in Sturges' trademark quick dialogue delivered brilliantly by Harrison as the cultivated, articulate Englishman( think of Noel Coward), and some of the slapstick that Sturges usually deploys to perfection and it seems like Sturges is at the top of his game. Even a few of the feature players from his Paramount team show up and do their usual notable job with goofy character roles. And Linda Darnell as the beautiful and adoring wife plays a pretty good foil to Harrison
But I don't think the ""flash forward"" works very well overall, as the movie slows down, and loses tempo. It is almost too clever, and the basic premise of a man erroneously assuming his wife unfaithful, becomes convoluted. Also, some of the gags seem stale to me, and the whole scene where Rex Harrison destroys his room as the thought of infidelity turns the urbane wit into an angry, blithering idiot feels like a tired, slapstick routine.
It's ok as old Hollywood comedies go, but I can see why the film was not successful at the box office. One can appreciate Sturges effort to be a little innovative, and I found the film amusing, but not hilarious like the Sturges from the Paramount days.",1387756800,2,2520,4.759725400457666

1194655,4,B000006GE5,"Although it is unfortunate that this film was not successful when it was released (partially due to the Rex Harrison/Carole Landis scandal and also to the dark tones of the film), it is arguably one of the three greatest Sturges films (along with Sullivan's Travels and Hail the Conquering Hero).

If there is one film that showcases Sturges' talent as a screenwriter, this one is it. The dialogue is consistently hysterical, from the opening salvo between Sir Alfred and his brother-in-law to the 'Russian Roulette' speech. If there is one thing Sturges got right with this film, it's the dialogue - it's cuttingly funny and delivered with perfect timing.

This brings me to Rex Harrison, who gives one of the funniest performances in cinema history. He is perfect, and perfectly neurotic, as Sir Alfred, a jealous symphony conductor obsessed with the idea that his wife and confidant are having an ongoing affair. His wife, played by Linda Darnell, isn't necessarily the strong female typical of Sturges' earlier work but her leisurely composition and smooth voice give a stark contrast to Harrison's loud, uptight Alfed. And I think the dynamic really shines when Alfred is at odds with Daphne(the Darnell character).

For what is generally known for being a straight comedy, the structure of Unfaithfully Yours is really unique. The second act of the film is comprised of a series of fantasies, all of which take place in Sir Alfred's mind (while he's conducting a concert, no less). More interesting still, one of the lengthier episodes is a full-on shocker, a film noir with darkly comic undertones. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the section would work as a short film on it's own. There are also a couple of scenes that turn full-on slapstick and (again) contrast sharply with other sections of the film.

While I do feel the slapstick scenes run too long and feel a bit unnecessary, I find the contrast in styles interesting. The film is an amalgam of dialogue-driven comedy, slapstick, noir and romance. It doesn't always pay off but it's fun to watch and keeps the viewer on his/her toes. In this respect, you can see the influence Sturges had on modern film makers like Quentin Tarantino (whose also known for contrasting styles and moods).

I docked one star off of the score only because I thought the two slapstick scenes (the fire-hose scene and when Alfred frantically searches for his recorder) ran too long and weren't nearly as funny as the dialogue scenes. But don't get me wrong, this movie is terrific and the two slapstick scenes aren't enough to ruin an otherwise fantastic comedy.",1242691200,4,2613,4.8629213483146065

1194658,5,B000006GE5,"When I saw this movie as a kid, it was billed as a murder mystery, and I recall being so horrified as Rex Harrison planned and executed his fiendish and ghastly perfect crime that I wanted to leave the movie theatre; and then when the entire scenario was turned on its head as Harrison actually put what turned out to be a figment of his musical imagination into action--or made a bungling effort to do so--I was very glad I had not left. My sides ached from tear-splashed laughter then, and they still do every time I watch this gem of a film.

Now that I am older, I also appreciate what a brilliantly sophisticated comedy Preston Sturges' ""Unfaithfully Yours"" is. Harrison's wit is (pardon the pun) razor sharp. Linda Darnell is stunningly beautiful both as the faithful wife of reality and the guilty wife of Harrison's imagination. The supporting cast, which includes Rudy Vallee as the pompous twit who stirs up the entire tempest in a teapot, and Barbara Lawrence as his acerbic wife, is excellent. Every character, in fact--from the handsome would-be lover down to the detectives, the tailor and the cymbal percussionist--is finely delineated. Even though Rex Harrison is never at home with the conductor's baton and the music-track is a bit dicey after all these years, the film, the DVD of which includes a commentary and a couple of interesting interviews, nevertheless remains priceless.",1214092800,3,1399,4.878151260504202
1194659,5,B000006GE5,"Preston Sturges knows how to write interesting characters in bizarre situations.

The basic premise is brilliant for what it offers, and Rex Harrison is perfectly hilarious.  Lovely Linda Darnell's performance(s) -- wonderful!  Added treats, as always with Sturges, are the various supporting players who add wonderful coloration to the storyline.  Rudy Vallee is particularly delightful!  Add in a wonderfully crafted Alfred Newman score that incorporates works of Rossini, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner, and you end up with a marvelously entertaining film.

The subject matter is as relevant today as it was in 1948, but the presentation can probably be better appreciated now than it was when it was first released. It is a very intelligent movie, and the performances are superb--defying expectations. I would have never expected to see Rex Harrison in this type of a role, and he proves to be excellent in it, portraying the paranoid, jealous, and fragile male who seems so powerful on the outside, and yet can be almost childlike in the way he relates to the world around him when his feelings are involved. The movie also reveals how easily love can turn to hatred when we become so immersed in our own needs and fears. This movie is not just cerebral, though. It is also very funny, especially when one notices the subtleties of the dialogue associated with some great slapstick.

An even bigger disappointment are the seemingly stream-of-conscious ramblings by Monty Pyton's Terry Jones, which make very little sense and add nothing to the enhancement of the film.  The only worthwhile extras are the reminiscences of Preston Sturges' widow, the very charming Sandy Sturges, and an absolutely brilliant booklet essay by Jonathan Lethem (why on earth didn't Criterion permit him to do the audio commentary?).  The film itself of course is marvellous, and among a sterling cast Edgar Kennedy (Sweeney the Private Eye) deserved a posthumous Best Supporting Actor nomination, but 1948 was not the era to acknowledge a masterful screen performance from a veteran comic of the old-time slapstick school.  For Edgar Kennedy alone, UNFAITHFULLY YOURS is worth revisiting many times over, but avoid the ""bonus material"" at all costs.",1186185600,3,1148,5.320441988950276
1194662,5,B000006GE5,"This film marked the beginning of the end for writer/director Preston Sturges. Subsequent to this his troubles with studios would limit his productivity; all that followed on film is the hit-or-miss ""Beautiful Blonde From Bashful Bend"" and the dismaying ""Diary of Major Thompson."" His real swan song of brilliance was this black comedy about a conductor who imagines several ways of `disposing,' shall we say, of his wife. Each scenario is deftly blended with a piece of classical music, and the film builds to a frenetic and frenzied comic pitch by the end. Sturges made better use of Rudy Vallee's comic talents than any other director, and Rex Harrison was always a master of the light comic touch. The extras on this disc are minimal (former Python Terry Jones offers an amusing introduction to the film), but the print--as always with Criterion--is pristine. Definitely worth picking up (and certainly far preferable to the disastrous 1984 remake with Dudley Moore; yikes).",1184803200,2,978,5.11875
1194663,2,B000006GE5,"With rare exceptions like Frasier or Comme une Image, most supposedly `sophisticated' comedies are usually either too clever by half or not half as clever as they think they are: this definitely falls into the latter category. It may be slightly more articulate, but it still comes down to pratfalls and clichs clumsily dispensed (not to mention an incredibly one-dimensional role for Linda Darnell as the wife whose sole reason for existence seems to be to worship her husband). Unfortunately it soon becomes apparent that despite his confidence in the early part of the film, Rex Harrison is entirely wrong for the part: aside from being so incredibly unsympathetic that he simply alienates you for most of the film, he has absolutely no facility for physical comedy, which renders what could and should have been a great comic setpiece where he accidentally trashes his hotel room far more thoroughly than any rock star ever could even dream of rather tedious and protracted. (Alfred Newman's surprisingly crudely over the top slide-whistle and horn 'comic' underscoring all but stones the scene to death, a surprising lapse of judgment from a great composer in a film revolving around classical music.) In the hands of an actor with a modicum of physical comedy timing it could have been gold, but instead it's almost reduced to a technical exercise.

But the same could be said for much of the film. The idea of having the execution and resolution of Harrison's fantasies dictated by the pace of the music he conducts (Rossini for murder, Wagner for mournful forgiveness, Tchaikovsky for suicide) is inspired, but it results in scenes that feel forced, as if at the mercy of a galley slave master's drumbeat. That the scenes themselves are so predictable doesn't help, as goodwill and admiration gradually gives way to boredom in the second half.

There are, however, two saving graces. One is the scene in private detective Edgar Kennedy's office, where Harrison is furious to discover that the man he has come to castigate is a knowledgeable fan with his own tale of loss. The scene is crudely performed and reads better than it plays, but there's heart and humanity there that's lacking in too much of the rest of the film. But the film's genuine standout moment is the orchestra rehearsal, one of the best pieces of filmed musical performance in the movies, not only showing how the music is constructed but showing the life, character and human soul behind it. The loss of those qualities in the rest of the movie is all the more keenly felt in an increasingly arid and overplayed technical exercise.",1156982400,,2610,4.916099773242631
1194664,5,B000006GE5,"It is easy to understand why they changed everything but the bare premise of this movie for the 1984 remake.  After all, the 1948 original staggered beneath the weight of massive burdens.  Its star performer not only consented but actually seemed to delight in delivering precisely articulated dialogue in long blocks, one after another--and all at crackling pace, too.  Worse, Preston Sturges' clever, witty script plainly assumed that his audience possessed both general knowledge and willingness to pay attention for whole minutes at a time.  Worst, Sturges' plot satirized both movie stereotypes and audience expectations.

Those 1948 audiences, for good and sufficient reasons of their own, did not turn out in droves nor did they shell out much money to see ""Unfaithfully Yours.""  The 1984 production team did their very best to avoid that dismal fate by jettisoning Sturges' near-perfect script, ruthlessly dumbing everything down and shrinking the film to fit the talents of twinkly little Dudley Moore.

(Rex Harrison to Dudley Moore, what a falling off was there!)

Harrison plays British conductor, Sir Alfred de Carter, whom the script clearly expects the audience to identify with the real conductor, Sir Thomas Beecham.  The initial satirical thrust at  audience expectations is that de Carter turns out to be a super-egotistical prima donna rather than the smooth, lovable and--yes!--twinkly Sir Thomas.  By a series of satisfactorily ridiculous plot developments, Sir Alfred becomes convinced that his beautiful and much younger wife is having an affair with his assistant.

Sir Alfred has a high comedy encounter with a detective played by Edgar Kennedy, one of the finest second bananas in movie history.  The detective does his level best to convince the wronged husband to ignore or forgive his wife's little failings, lest he lose far more than he can ever hope to gain from shallow, trifling revenge.  In the course of the scene it becomes clear that the detective had not taken his own advice in the past and now bitterly regrets it.  This is a wonderful scene, and probably Kennedy's last hurrah on the screen, for he died shortly thereafter--a perfect mixture of hilarity and wistfulness.

The egotist brushes aside the warnings of the detective and transforms himself into Othello's younger brother.  Before, he had been over-generous and almost too-eloquent for belief with his loving words; now, he sneers and derides.  If he does not quite get around to demanding that his bewildered wife hand over a handkerchief, it is only because time is short and he has a concert to conduct.

The performance begins with an overture by Rossini.  The up-tempo music puts the conductor into a manic mood and his mind turns to a plot in which he murders his wife and casts damning suspicion on his rival.  The elaborate machinations of the murder scheme satirize whole flocks of creakily overblown films from ""The Bat"" to ""Philo Vance and the Kennel Murders.""  The second selection is the music of the pilgrims from Wagner's Tannhaeuser--a downer after Rossini.  The conductor's imagination shifts from murderous revenge to world-weary forgiveness as it satirizes the emetic nobility of films such as the often-remade ""Four Feathers.""  Finally, a Tschaikovsky piece  moves Sir Alfred's thoughts to grim competitiveness.  He will challenge his younger rival to a game of Russian roulette with his wife as a reluctant witness--think of about half the films made by John Barrymore or Doug Fairbanks, Jr.

After the concert, the conductor rushes off to his home to prepare for his elaborate murder scheme, only to come hilariously crashing against the harsh reality of ruthlessly hostile mechanisms, cheerily incomprehensible operating instructions and painfully fragile chairs.

In the end, the conductor's wife offers an explanation that allows him to dismiss all his suspicions and return to his original state of (illusionary?) wedded bliss.

With brilliant performances, crackling dialogue, smart plotting and fine physical gags, ""Unfaithfully Yours"" ranks with ""The Ladykillers,"" ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" and ""Monsieur Verdoux,"" the best of black comedies.

Five stars.

IDLE SPECULATIONS: Good as it is--and it is very good--""Unfaithfully Yours"" might have been better still.

Rex Harrison, however brilliant he may be in the dialogue scenes, is not by any stretch of the imagination a physical comedian.  Even though screen credit is given to a conducting coach, Harrison is painfully stiff as a conductor and as often as not behind the beat of the music he is supposed to be conducting.  And the physical comedy sequence is weakened by the obvious substitution of a stunt double from time to time--not to mention the obvious fact that Harrison's record player is far funnier than he is.  In 1948 there was an actor of the right age, one who who could have gotten away with the conductor's dialogue and would unquestionably have been side-splittingly funny while conducting or going two falls out of three with the demon record player--Charlie Chaplin.  Now THAT would have been something to see!

Then there is the script.  The film ends on a subtly false note.  As ""Unfaithfuly Yours"" stands now, Linda Darnell's innocent wife neatly explains away every suspicion; she leaves not only her own virtue unblemished but also that of her unpleasant younger sister who throughout the film had been positioned as the eventual fall girl.  At the very end of the film, the fully reconciled conductor and wife turn away to depart for a happy evening on the town.

I think that the studio or even Sturges, himself, cut a final  scene to conform to the nervous dictates of the Film Code.  I think that as the happy couple and their friends leave the hotel, they were intended to pass by Edgar Kennedy, the detective who had striven so hard to preserve the de Carter marriage.  I think that Darnell and Kennedy were intended to make eye contact in shared acknowledgment that the pack of lies they had concocted to reassure Sir Alfred had worked.  Then, at last, the conductor's straying wife would indeed have been Unfaithfully His.",1151884800,7,6142,5.128643216080402
1194665,5,B000006GE5,"Preston Sturges just might be the greatest writer/director ever to have worked in Hollywood. Of his great comedies, any one may be said to be his finest: the moving humor of Sullivan's Travels, the censor-defying scandal-causing hilarity of The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, the high sophistication of The Lady Eve, the sarcastic finger pointing satire of Hail the Conquering Hero, or even the beautiful trifling bauble that is Christmas in July.

But my vote goes to Unfaithfully Yours, Sturges' blackest, most sinister, and most sophisticated comedy. Some might say it could never compare to his earlier Paramount comedies, but in my opinion, Sturges never displayed his great talent as a filmmaker better than in this Twentieth Century Fox classic.

In his adroit combination of highly sophisticated verbal comedy, pratfalling physical gags, and audio humor, Sturges has created a comedic tale of warmth, beauty, and, at times, memorable terror.

The plot concerns an orchestra conductor, who through a series of unfortunate misunderstandings, suspects his beautiful wife of carrying on an affair with his secretary.

During his evening concert, the conductor imagines three different ways of dealing with this problem, all while conducting some famous pieces of classical music.

First, we get Fanatasia gone terribly wrong, as the razor-yielding conductor violently slashes his wife's throat to the dazzling overture from Rossini's Semiramide. He then gives us a tale of remorse, as Tannhauser's Pilgrim's Chorus provides the backdrop for a brief moment of forgiveness. And he finally presents a disturbing game of Russian Roulette to the strains of Tchaikovsky's Francesca di Rimini Overture...

But it is not until after the concert is over that the conductor must choose which of the three plans he wants to actually use on his wife. Back at his hotel apartment, Sturges' conductor tries to put into reality his plans which worked out so perfectly in his imagination---with little to no luck.

No description of Unfaithfully Yours could ever come close to summarizing the genius contained within the film. Sturges has so much to say about the male ego, relationships, music, and pride that the film can be viewed as a commentary on all of these things.

The cast is uniformly marvelous. Although many lament the fact that Sturges wasn't allowed to use his trustworthy cast of stock actors he had used consistently in his Paramount features, he certainly got equally good players to fill in all of his parts. Controlling the picture is Rex Harrison, who plays the conductor. His venemous line delivery and collosal temper create one of the most memorable characters in the cinematic tradition. Linda Darnell, a beauty of enormous unsung talent, displays her subtle comic technique in this film, creating four different and distinct characters: the real wife, the seductive tramp in the first hallucination, the guilty lover in the second, and the jittery nervous paramour in the third. She, under the magic hand of Sturges, displays acting of the highest form. Second leads Barbara Lawrence and Rudy Vallee give wonderful comedic performances that always hit their marks head on. And every single supporting role, from the private detective to the hotel telephone operators, are solid gold.

In all, Preston Sturges' Unfaithfully Yours is a film no fan can afford to miss. No matter what you have to do, you must see this film and bask in the glory that was Preston Sturges and the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1147996800,4,3510,5.187279151943463
1194666,4,B000006GE5,"I know Rex Harrison to be rather pompous, the very stero-typical Brit. He is also good at comedy, but I never thought he could be so ridiculously funny. He plays Sir Alfred Carter, reknown conductor. Against his better judgment he becomes convinced his wife is having an affair.

His plans to turn his perfect fantasy murder disolves into one of Preston Sturges' finest

slapstick routines as Sir Alfred silently falls into chaos &  demolishes his apartment.

  As it turns out there is no adultery at all, only a big misunderstanding reminiscent of the screwball comedies. Linda Darnell is young, beautiful & nice. More than Sir Alfred deserves.

1194668,5,B000006GE5,"I am biased on this film - one of my favorites, right up there with the best of Hitchcock - so I will only say for the movie itself that image and sound meet the high Criterion standard.

What I was more happily surprised about was the impression the bonus features had on me.

My usual favorite bonus feature is the commentary track, providing interesting tidbits on the production and actors. Although it is quite informative (my only bone to pick is that Linda Darnell was 27, not 32 as stated, when making the movie, so that the age difference between the married couple was actually as significant as it was for the story), I believe it is outshone by two other bonus features.

Terry Jones gives a quirky, heartfelt introduction that conveys a true love for Sturges and his work.

Best of all is Sandy Sturges, Sturges's widow (and fourth wife). It is easy to understand how an erudite genius could love such a woman! Delicate, proper, articulate, self-effacing, diplomatic and blunt, she is worth the price of admission!",1125273600,4,1027,4.688888888888889
1194669,4,B000006GE5,"In the history of Hollywood there are few greater mysteries than: what happened to Preston Sturges's talent.  From the 1930s, when he emerged as one of the sharpest screenwriters at Paramount to his short but brilliant career as a director, Sturges could do almost no wrong.  After crafting such outstanding scripts for films like EASY LIVING and REMEMBER THE NIGHT, Sturges was allowed to direct his own scripts, and the result was a string of brilliant comedies that were noted for their frenetic pace, frantic multi-layered dialogue, and brilliant slapstick.  Between 1940 and 1944 he managed to turn out THE GREAT MCGINTY, CHRISTMAS IN JULY, THE LADY EVE, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, THE PALM BEACH STORY, THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK, and HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO.  No other director in history ever enjoyed a finer five years directing comedy than that.  Then, suddenly, his gifts were gone, never to be fully regained.  What is astonishing is how completely his gifts deserted him.

Sturges did, however, manage to regain form to turn out one final good comedy.  UNFAITHFULLY YOURS is not among his finest films, but in the post-1944 period, it is clearly his last good one.  If one turns from THE PALM BEACH STORY to UNFAITHFULLY YOURS, one notices how much has been lost.  In the latter there is no rapid-fire dialogue, no brilliant witticisms, few touches of inspired anarchy.  There is in the final part of the film some wonderfully slapstick, but by the standards that Sturges had set for himself, it has to stand as something of a disappointment.

Still, if one can put THE LADY EVE and SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS out of mind for a bit, and view UNFAITHFULLY YOURS strictly on its own merits, it is a highly entertaining film graced by a splendid star performance by the always fascinating Rex Harrison.  It is also made with enormous competence and style.  Just watch the way the camera gradually flows from behind the orchestra all the way to an extreme close up on Sir Alfred's eye.

For the most part, this is not a funny film nor is it meant to be.  The first two thirds of the film are, in fact, barely humorous at all.  It is all set up for the hilarity at the end.  Sir Alfred has learned that detectives have reason to suspect that his wife might be unfaith to him with his personal secretary.  The chief detective is played by Edgar Kennedy, who is famous for his slow burns in a host of films from the silent era through the advent of sound, perhaps most famously as the lemonade vendor in DUCK SOUP.  He died shortly after appearing in this film.  At first Sir Alfred refuses to believe the rumors, but by the time the concert begins he is convinced of her duplicity, and during the concert he allows the music to seduce him into fantasies of revenge and murder and suicide.  The humor comes only at the end when he sneaks off to put his fantasies into action.  But instead of the suave, competent murder of his imagination, he becomes an oafish, bungling fool, almost demolishing his apartment searching for all the items he needs to implement his plans.  It is a brilliant sequence, and while it doesn't cause a Sturges fan from lamenting the loss of verbal brilliance found in the earlier films, it is nonetheless a delightful sequence.  The ending is a bit abrupt and a tad too pat, but all in all it is a highly entertaining film.  Rex Harrison has been better in film, but only rarely.

Sir Alfred de Carter is, by the way, a subtle parody of the brilliant English conductor Sir Thomas Beecham, one of my favorite conductors (I have around ten CDs featuring him as conductor).  The resemblance is referential rather than visual, since Harrison bears little resemblance to Sir Thomas.  One reference to Beecham stems from Edgar Kennedy's mention of Sir Alfred's mastery of Delius.  The one conductor who is inevitably associated with Delius is Sir Thomas Beecham, who is the definitive interpreter of his work.  The Delius reference alone would be sufficient to reference Beecham, but the names are also a giveaway.  Harrison's Carter alludes indirectly to the Carter Liver Pills and their role in keeping ""England regular.""  Sir Thomas Beecham's family owned the Beecham's Liver Pills and hopefully also did their share in keep England regular.  Anyone wanting to explore Beecham's work should look either at his recordings of Delius, his marvelous recording of LA BOHEME (with the brilliant Jussi Bjoerling), or the disc that collects his recordings of Sibelius's 4th and 6th Symphonies.

After UNFAITHFULLY YOURS, the quality of Sturges's work plummeted.  Although he is widely regarded as one of the great comic directors in film history, he actually made an astonishingly small number of films.  His reputation rests on the brilliance of those films of 1940-1944, though this one certainly very nearly stands comparison with those.",1124496000,6,4851,4.836363636363636
1194670,5,B000006GE5,"The mind has the ability to create wondrous things and ideas, as history is full of inspired examples such as the concept of democracy and the understanding of genetics.  Preston Struges' comedy Unfaithfully Yours has nothing to do with democracy, or genetics, but the actual ability of the mind to imagine.  Besides the aptitude of the mind, it can also be incapacitated by emotional reactions, which could effectively destroy any positive progress of the mind.  Nonetheless, emotions can also be an artistic source of genius, if coherently processed and displayed.  Sturges considers multiple angles of the mind in his brilliant Unfaithfully Yours, which delivers an amusing roller coaster that exploits the prowess and vulnerability of the mind to perfection.

On the return to United States, the English aristocrat and world famous conductor Sir Alfred De Carter (Rex Harrison) embraces his younger wife Daphne (Linda Darnell) at the airport.  Uncaring of the audience, Sir Alfred kisses while declaring his love for Daphne in a way only a poet could in a moment of genius.  Then the Carter couple retreats to their hotel room, where they permanently live, for a quiet night in each others arms.  The following day, the bubble of love seems to blow up when his socially inept and wealthy brother-in-law August comes to inform Sir Alfred about an arrangement that has completely slipped his mind.  The arrangement was for August to ""keep an eye on his wife"" while Sir Alfred was in England.  To complicate things, August misunderstood Sir Alfred's request and hired a private detective to shadow his wife.  Sir Alfred's intention with ""keep an eye on his wife"" was for August and his wife to take out Daphne for amusement, if she was bored.

The grave misunderstanding by August embarrasses Sir Alfred who intends to destroy any evidence of the hired private detective. In addition, Sir Alfred desires to know nothing about what the detectives might have discovered, as his moral judgment of the situation tells him that this is wrong in the most vile manner.  However, by accident Sir Alfred discovers that Daphne, on a late evening occasion when he was in England, left her room dressed only in a negligee.  The discovery upsets him, and when he returns home strong feelings of resentment boil up and begin to cloud his thoughts, while he must prepare for the evening concert.

Rage, sadness, resentment and many other feelings storm through Sir Alfred who intends to perform despite his shaming findings.  He puts all of his emotions in a very controlled manner into his conducting, which helps deliver his finest performance ever.  The concert is divided into three different pieces, and each piece presents a different emotion and vision.  During his performance his visions are illustrated into perfection where he deals with his wife by arranging the perfect murder, sending her off, and a satire of bad luck.  In between his visions, the audience is feverishly applauding his brilliant performance.  After the performance, Sir Alfred intends to utilize one of these visions to end his marriage with Daphne, which presents a wittingly fitting slap-stick situation that will undoubtedly cause several deep laughs.

Sturges delivery of this brilliant comedy makes it easy to just lean back and enjoy the intriguing plot or simply be amused by the wonderful humor.  Nonetheless, Sturges does not make films that are simple, as he dissects the metaphysics of Sir Alfred while also give a considerable impact with the cognitive science on the story.  To make the film even more appealing, he gives the story a dash of love, jealousy, and male insecurity, which is compounded into a charming mixture that will give any viewer something to enjoy or ponder for some time.",1122508800,4,3773,5.05
1194671,1,B000006GE5,"I caught a promo of this DVD in one of the many film circulars I get, and, as a fan of Preston Sturges, couldn't wait to get it, but this film, for all the commentary I read, was a huge disappointment. Not that it wasn't hysterically funny in parts - the scenes in which ""reality"" sets in on a fantastic flight of vengeful fantasy were classic - but some older films don't sit well precisely because their comedic line has been overshadowed by a bleaker modern reality. Especially disturbing was the fantasy murder by shaving razor. Mind you, there is no blood and you are assured this is a total fantasy, albeit dark and extravagantly overplayed, but it somehow doesn't come across as funny these days. Don't get me wrong. This is not a slasher film by any means. It means to be funny, but the dialogue, good as it is at times, gets lost being too cute, the orchestral sound flutters at an unacceptable level, even with remastering, and the only part worth seeing, just for sheer physical humor, is at the end, when Rex Harrison cannot (when he finds it) get a recording machine to work (shades of your first 10 computers), trips over electrical cords (what a dance!), cuts himself with the razor, spills ink all over his checkbook, and can't find bullets for his gun. Again, I find Mad Wednesday and Sullivan's Travels absolutely terrific, which is why I was expecting more from this film. Maybe I wasn't in the mood. There are excellent comedic moments, and I love the classical pieces being played (despite the crummy sound quality), but somehow the ""parts"" didn't quite make a whole.

But the most interesting effort of "" Unfaithfully yours"" is the use of the music and its innovative narrative structure,two elements that are subtlely connected during the most part of the film, and the intelligent incorporation of the theme of the subconscious ( before Freud's theories becomes a mode in Hollywood)that has a definitive role in the construction of the main character,Sir Alfred(in the hotel room where stays Sir Alfred(Rex Harrison)we see several surrealist paints by Dali ), a refined, conceited and temperamental orchestra conductor who during his musical performance hours after he's informed about the infidelity of his wife ( Linda Darnell )daydreams three possible action ways to forge his wife's treachary. The three symphonical pieces he conducts ( Rossini, Wagner and Tchaikovsky, played in this order ) conditions the ""stuff"" of the three passional solutions that conceive his fantasy ). But his purpose to carry out his first "" fantastic "" plan ( this is, to kill his wife ) flow into a chain of comic disasters where fantasy and sophistication fail in front of "" reality ""

The DVD edition from Criterion Collection contains interviews with Sandy Sturges and Terry Jones. Excellent copy.",1120435200,3,2067,5.244712990936556
1194673,5,B000006GE5,"In ""Unfaithfully Yours"" Rex Harrison plays a conductor who imagines what he would do to his wife (who he believes to be cheating on him)during a performance. Unfortunately, he discovers that real life never works as smoothly as one's fantasies. A classic Preston Sturges comedy, ""Unfaithfully Yours"" captures the brilliant comedy director in top form. Although there was an anemic remake with Dudley Moore in 1984 (with a screenplay co-written by Valerie Curtain the cousin of Jane Curtain of ""Saturday Night Live"" fame and one of the original cast members of ""Three's Company""), all it does is prove not to mess with a classic film.

This new Criterion edition has some really cool extras and the image quality is very, very good. The audio Audio commentary by Sturges scholars James Harvey, Diane Jacobs, and Brian Henderson are fascinating but I honestly preferred the video appreciation by Terry Jones (of Monty Python fame) as well as the video interview with Sandy Sturges. There's also an essay by Jonathan Lethem, a photo gallery and correspondence on the production of the film. This is one of Sturges' greatest black comedies and well worth picking up.

Now all Ihave to do is wait for my other favorite Sturges films-""Hail the Conquering Hero"" and ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" on DVD (Oh, and ""Christmas in July"" would also be much appreciated as well). His classics are finally trickling out and I'm quite happy that they've made a much belated appearence on DVD.",1116720000,23,1478,4.979757085020243
7904456,5,B000006GE5,"This movie is as good as I remember from when I first saw it fifty mumble years ago, when I fell in love with ""the simplified diagram on page six"" as a comedic self deprecation technique for documentation of overblown projects I have worked on.

The movie looks like a Rom-Com, but is littered with slapstick and hysterical sound effects added just for the joy of it. My wife and I cracked up every time the mantel clock chimed, and I had to rewind the bit where Rex Harrison pokes the sandwich just to hear the bread squeak again (another moment that carved itself into my brain when I saw it as a teen). The scene with the shellac disc recorder is comedy genius. I don't know where the idea came from or how it evolved, but the finished article is nothing short of brilliant.

And look for the two-headed bust. I never noticed them beforee but they had me cracking up this time around. Every cupboard Harrison opens has two of them inside somewhere. Why? What on earth were they? Awards? Frivolous purchases? Unwanted ""furnished apartment"" ornaments? I dunno, but every time he opened a cupboard I was eagerly looking for - and finding - the damn things. And always in pairs.

If you've seen the Dudley Moore remake, please do yourself a big favour and see this version. It is superior in every way.

The transfer seems very good too. No DVD looks ""great"" on today's TVs, but this one looks much better than I expected, extremely well restored. The sound is very crisp. I noticed no artifacts or dropouts. Doesn't mean they are not there, just that I missed them because I was laughing so hard.

Very highly recommended.",1524441600,,1622,4.541095890410959
