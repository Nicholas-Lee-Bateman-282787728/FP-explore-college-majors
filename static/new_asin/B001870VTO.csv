3411944,5,B001870VTO,I watched this TV when I was in middle school in China.  I love all characters of the story and television.  I was so surprised to find that the television is available in DVD.  And the price is very good.  I love it.,1393977600,2,217,3.9767441860465116
3411945,5,B001870VTO,"As a fan of this version of Wind in the Willows since the 1990's, I waited several years for the American release of seasons four and five.  As of yet, that has not happened.
When I saw this UK collection of the complete series, I was very pleased.  If you have a DVD player that will accomodate the format (I think PAL), you will be able to see more wonderful stories of Toad, Badger, Ratty, Mole, the Weasels and the rest.  Your patience will be rewarded!  I can whole-heartedly recommend the retailer, Factory Distributor.  They promptly contacted me to make sure I was aware of the non USA format.  And even though the shipment came from overseas, it arrived within one week in excellent condition - a wonderful surprise.
If you love Wind in the Willows - and I consider this the best rendition - treat yourself and enjoy!",1352419200,5,826,4.510067114093959
3411946,5,B001870VTO,"This is an abolute pleasure to watch.  Sure, it is aimed at children but adults will probably like it better than the kids.  The stories are pleasant, and the characters are delightful.  There is no terror but a good deal of pathos.  The quality of the animation is first rate.  The only criticism I have was the decision to eliminate the narrator from the final year and make every episode center entirely on toad, a somewhat annoying character in my opinion.  One reminder.  You need a DVD player that will play Region 2 disks.  Most of them sold in the USA will not.  I happened to get a new HG Blue Ray player specifically because it will play Region 2 (Great Britain) disks.",1350864000,8,679,4.455284552845528
3411947,4,B001870VTO,"I have long loved Cosgrove Hall's definitive ""Wind in the Willows."" For a long time, only the ""movies"" and the first two seasons have been available on DVD. Therefore, I eagerly ordered this so-called ""complete collection"" (hereinafter referred to as ""CC""). The good news is that the set contains all 65 episodes (notwithstanding the problem with the ""Yuletide"" episode, mentioned below), plus the two ""feature length"" episodes.

Unfortunately, for enthusiasts of this masterpiece of stop-motion animation, this ""complete"" collection is a ""poisoned pleasure"" for several reasons:

1. NO disc contents or episode guide is provided. Luckily, the Kenneth Grahame Society website provides a great deal of information about the Cosgrove Hall and other ""Wind"" series, and includes an episode guide with Season Five in the correct order (more about this anon), and a helpful synopsis for every episode.

2. Season Five is radically out of sequence. Starting from the first episode on DVD #9, from top to bottom the correct sequence is: 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 8, 9, 7, 10, 11, 2, 12, 13.

3. At least ONE episode--""The Yuletide Entertainment""--is seriously abridged. In its original form (on the A&E DVD's of Season One) it is about 25 minutes. Here it is cut to about 20, presumbly to bring it in line with the duration of the other episodes so the standard number of commercials could be inserted in syndicated broadcasts. Unfortunately, this means that, among other things, Otter's endearingly inept piano performance is completely lost. My own solution was to keep all of the CC DVD's, while also keeping the second DVD of the Season One set, tucking it inside the CC set. The quality of the images is almost identical, although the colors of CC are a bit more saturated.

Of course, the mutilation of the ""Yuletide"" episode leads me to wonder what other vandalism Freemantle Media has perpetrated here that I haven't noticed. The point is, whether one notices cuts or not, the buyer is being cheated, and it is NOT a matter of a compromise forced by disc duration. Even if such were the case, ""complete"" editions are not designed for casual ""greatest hits"" shoppers, but for dedicated fans and collectors, who wouldn't mind paying for another DVD, if necessary, for the sake of TRUE completeness. This is, however, the first appearance of Seasons Three through Five on ANY form of home entertainment media, so one has no choice but to accept them as they are presented here. (I'd be grateful if any other purchasers of this set would point out any other cuts they might notice.)

4. I'm not wild about the packaging. The plastic holders on each ""page"" hold two DVD's, but it appears to me that they hold the lower disc in a perpetual slight bend, which may encourage warping.

CAVEAT EMPTOR! The ""Universal--suitable for all"" indication on the box does not mean that the DVD's are Region 0--this an audience suitability code, similar to our ""G"". As AMAZON points out, these DVD's are Region 2. For me, this presents no problem because I own a multi-region DVD player, but don't be confused by that big ""U"".

Despite my caveats, seeing this series again has given me much pleasure, and there were even a few episodes I don't recall ever seeing. The Cosgrove Hall series itself deserves a rating of infinite stars, but the careless no-frills presentation of the present set pulls it down. I had originally considered a three-star rating, but the material itself is too good for that. Recommended, with reservations. ""Wind in the Willows"" is arguably Cosgrove Hall's crown jewel, and it deserves first-class treatment. Although I am glad to have Seasons Three through Five at last, considering the toweringly high quality of the original material, this set should and could have been so much better--fellow fans, please don't execute the messenger.",1320451200,37,3834,4.9517884914463455
8268573,5,B001870VTO,"One of the few cartoons my daughter watched as a child, and these are by far the best renderings of Kenneth Grahame's beloved stories. The Illustrations of Beverly Bush certainly bring the characters to life. Every episode, plus the original movie and ""A Tale of Two Toads"" are included. I rate this a five star; and it was worth purchasing the multi regional player just to be able to once again view these gems. My only complaint is the condition of the case; which seems to have been damaged in shipping,",1508457600,,507,4.582417582417582
8268574,5,B001870VTO,Very happy to finally have the complete set of this series.  It is so fun to watch.,1460592000,,83,3.8823529411764706
8268575,5,B001870VTO,I recall the saturday mornings when I woke up early to see this when I was little but then all the sudden the show stopped coming on TV long story short I never forgot about it also because Peter Sallis aka Clegg from Last of the Summer Wine and David Jason aka Grainville from Open All Hours and aka Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses voiced Toad and Rat long story short I am Grateful I have this in my collection I can watch more so see episodes I never were able to see before but now I can the only thing I do not really care for is the episode listings are on the slipcover and the DVDs are some what hard to take out so I have to be very careful cause I do not want to crack the discs,1458172800,,691,3.839160839160839
8268576,1,B001870VTO,Who has a multi-region DVDs player?? Don't buy this if you have a normal DVD or bluray player! What a waste!!,1457654400,,109,4.238095238095238
8268577,5,B001870VTO,"The quintessential Wind in the Willows. There is no better rendition than this one. A number of years ago when Netflix was new they had the entire collection and as I was recovering from a medical issue I will admit I watched these over and over,,and fell in love with them. My cat would curl up with me and we'd watch them together on my laptop.
For years I tried to find them (after Netflix ditched them) and I purchased the first two seasons on ITunes hoping that they would get the additional seasons,,alas that never happened. I even considered buying a DVD player that would play that region...until I read a review right here on Amazon (bless you Amazon Reviewers!) and one said to use an XBox... well guess what,,,my son has one of those I thought.. I was right and low and behold they work beautifully..My cat and I are so happy,, we stay up late and watch Moley and Ratty and ignore Toad as much as possible!!
These are so well done,,especially if you consider how long ago they were produced. The movements are do detailed that it continues to amaze me every time I watch them I see something new,,these really are beautifully done and for anyone with young children these are a perfect ""quiet time"" viewing.
My only complaint is one episode that is mentioned by another reviewer. The Yuletide episode not only lacks Otter's piano performance but the Field Mice singing their Christmas Carol. Which is an enormous loss in my opinion but is included in the ITunes version..how odd. As well the last season is not quite as enjoyable (for me at least) because they dropped the narrator which I thought was one of those things that made it so quaint and it centers more around Toad who is my least favorite character. That being said children may enjoy it more,,who knows.
So remember if you have an XBox you don't need a special DVD player to play these.
For anyone who was a fan of the book or just if you're looking for some family viewing that everyone can enjoy (perhaps even with your cat) this collection is well worth the price.",1448928000,2,2043,4.524324324324325
8268578,5,B001870VTO,I am delighted to have found this full collection and enjoy it very much. The animation and detail are incredible. Each story has a message that appeals to children and adults.,1437696000,,176,4.709677419354839
8268579,5,B001870VTO,I used to watch the Wind in the Willows on PBS when I was younger and seeing these brought back memories.  You have to get a region-free dvd player to view them but it is well worth the price and a region-free dvd play is very inexpensive.  I would highly recommend them and it would be a great series for your kids.,1426377600,,316,4.080645161290323
