8507296,5,B006ZXO2TG,"Different perspectives in comparison to most Korean dramas. Kind of sex and the city type story, but quite entertaining. I enjoyed it.",1426204800,,134,5.136363636363637
8507297,5,B006ZXO2TG,"There is a tendency for romantic comedies to treat romance as some sort of didactic search for True Love. In I NEED ROMANCE, a trio of close female friends not only question where this trail might lead but also question whether True Love even exists. Of the three two are reasonably similar in their outlooks on life. One is a thirty-three year old concierge manager who discovers that her movie director boyfriend has cheated on her with a young starlet. The other is a thirty something virgin lawyer who is stood up at the altar by a man who is not turned on sexually by her aura. These two suffer a great deal with the inevitable ebb and flow of romances gone sour. The third is a late twentyish model who goes through life asking nothing from the many men with whom she unabashedly has one night stands. These three ladies often meet for girl talk during which they each lecture the other on How To Snag A Man. Such advice is usually well meant but is more of a function of that one girl's recent experience than what might be applicable to either of the other two. The various males slipping in and out of their lives are reasonably normal and want to connect with their respective lovers but misunderstandings inevitably occur. The comedy underlying the plot is tinged with the bittersweet sadness that forcibly intrudes in each of the sixteen episodes. Most Korean TV comedies are replete with the heavy hand of Korean family values but here such values blend in with the storyline rather than structure it. Mixed in with the laughs is the unsettling notion that what we call True Love is an emotion that must be respected and nurtured if a couple is to endure. The model with her incessant affairs might argue this point as one of her lovers warns her that a life alone is likely. I NEED ROMANCE is a marvelously entertaining look at what passes for love both in Korea and in nearly every other society as well.",1400371200,,1919,4.53314121037464
8507298,5,B006ZXO2TG,"Three professional women with beauty , brains,, and a drive to succeed.  Very refreshing to watch how all 3 girls maneuver through their lives each individual dealing with whatever life throws at them.  It is amazing how resilient the female gender is regardless of race, social and economic conditions that affects them.  It was also surprising the see just how patriarchal Korean society is, but that didn't stop our heroines.  YOU GO GIRLS!!  Many funny and well written scenes, especially when our lead is pursued by a Chaebol grandson or when another is faced with a missing bridegroom or even when the third heroine is assisting the wife of the man she is having an affair with deliver her baby. It was truly, fast moving, interesting and funny, hence my 5 star rating, it is worth watching.",1373760000,,797,4.788321167883212
8507299,4,B006ZXO2TG,"I really ended up liking this drama.

I had avoided watching it for a while because of how often it is compared to Sex in the City.

It centers on the lives of three friends, hotelier In Young who is in a long term relationship, fashionista Seo Yeon who is a man eater and Hyun Joo while a successful lawyer is ditched on her wedding day.

All three women get their own, well developed, storylines--having to do with their various romantic tendencies.  The main focus, however, is In Young who's long term boyfriend, Kim Sung Soo, is a film director who is just achieving success (After years of her supporting him).

The problem is, that with success, he withdraws from her. Not only that but the young actress from his successful movie is in love with him.

In Young does the best she can to get over her heartbreak. Which is the exact right balance of poignant and hilarious. Everything she does is completely believable and stays away from going totally over the top, while still succeeding in being funny. I laugh out loud at least once and episode. Just as she is succeeding in her attempts to get over Kim Sung Soo (played by my favorite actor from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Palace/dp/B000IZJ20Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Palace</a>Kim Jung Hoon) he ups the ante, not wanting to let her go.

There is a fabulous push pull between the two of them, the entire time her friends supporting her--and she in turn supporting them through their various foibles.

It is a nice ""grown up"" feeling drama. It reminded me in some ways of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridget-Jones-s-Diary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B004SEUJK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridget Jones's Diary (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;but more grounded in reality.

It was surprisingly thoughtful and I'd enjoy watching it again.",1356998400,,1887,5.547038327526132
