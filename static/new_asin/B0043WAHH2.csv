8415361,4,B0043WAHH2,"In the near to Detroit suburb of Highland Park, Michigan, comes this film about something that would make headlines if it happened in Los Angeles, Chicago or some other major city.  It's an interesting look at a saga that literally had homeowners evicted from their homes - or left to live without water - or threatened to have children removed to foster care (yet another arm of government expense).  When I watch films like this, I wonder how could this happen in America?

It tells the story of how outsourcing your water department can have catastrophic results.  I am the first to agree people must take personal responsibility for their own financial situations (as I point out in my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maxed-Out/dp/B000OU081M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maxed Out</a>).  However, no person living in the United States should ever receive a water bill OVER 100 times the average most Americans pay.  That's exactly what happened as you'll see in 'The Water Front'.  Pretty much everyone agrees they must pay for water and the processing.

Why I like the documentary?  At the start, it's not easy to identity whose side the filmmaker is on.  This becomes clear as we progress, but it shows their effort in showcasing both sides.  A town with a huge deficit in the water department, and a (flawed) effort to rectify the issue.  The filmmaker goes up close and personal with residents (many appear to be life-long) and the (expensive) officials 'hired' to fix the problem.  It's key to note those hired were not from within the community, where unemployment is staggering (and made worse by the consultants hired to fix the problem as local citizens were laid off).

To some extent it's an uplifting story of people fighting back and standing up for their rights.  What makes the film standout is this is happening in a Detroit suburb, a region of our country already plagued by overwhelming blight.  While it's a form of Government corruption, it ends with a rare example of government doing the right thing, but not after the people stand up and fight.  If you're looking for something similar, also consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth/dp/B0077QPPDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pruitt-Igoe Myth</a>.  But definitely consider viewing this documentary for a very personal battle for some basic human needs.",1389312000,,2446,5.477333333333333
