8249349,5,B00136MBNY,Jordan Maxwell presents an eye opening and interesting information on religion which makes good sense since I did know the people of the middle east were sun worshippers.  It is good to know the truth,1408665600,,200,4.714285714285714

If you like Jordan Maxwell ... This is a great DVD set... If you enjoy this sort of thing look for Michael Tsarion on Youtube ...",1394668800,2,141,3.896551724137931
8249351,5,B00136MBNY,"Professional presentation without resorting to rants and biased viewpoint. Maxwell totally exposes the Christian Story for what it is - falsehood. Only those seeking truth with an open mind will benefit from these DVDs. All 3 must be viewed in order to understand the author's premise. Although this is but a piece of a much larger and darker puzzle, it's a good starting point for learning what the Christian Deception is all about - enslavement!",1380931200,5,447,4.973333333333334
