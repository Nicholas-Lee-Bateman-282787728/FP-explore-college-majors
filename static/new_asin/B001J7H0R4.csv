3652670,5,B001J7H0R4,"The end of Lions, and how it came about.  The DVD starts out with the voice of
the late great Steve Evans!  More and more drivers try to tame these out of
control top fuel rides, untill it nearly takes the life of Big Daddy Don Garlits.
Everybody tried to get the rear engine car to work, and some made it work for a
short time, but Garlits made it work forever.  Then the last drag race came on
December 2nd 1972. As they say (And the rest is history) Part 3 is as good as
1 and 2.  Trust me when I say, you need all 3.  Hats off to Don Gillespie
for the best documentary on the best drag strip of all time (LIONS).",1251158400,7,616,3.857142857142857

8312144,5,B001J7H0R4,"The best of the California I grew up with. Before it became an overpopulated police state filled with too many liberal conformist drones. Gillespie is to be congratulated for compiling some of the essence of the wonderful things we experienced in our youth. The quintessential fearless American can-do attitude when people who are afraid to drive to the store unless surrounded by a dozen air bags would have been simply incomprehensible. Progress is good, but the softies might benefit from a tour of duty in the Marines or getting sat down behind one of these monsters from when ""No Fear"" was a hell of a lot more than a slogan on a t-shirt. Buy it-you'll love it. Bring a little of the wildness back. Freedom!",1265760000,,712,4.704
