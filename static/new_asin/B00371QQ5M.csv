4080142,5,B00371QQ5M,"This DVD is little over an hour. It is not what I was looking for. I know most of the life of Charles Haddon Spurgeon, but most people who do not know his life story this is a good place to begin. Spurgeon was truly a man gifted to preach. He began preaching in his teens, and a church in London called him to come over. People began flocking to his church and a new larger building had to be built. His voice could fill the large building before the days of PA systems.  There were two secretaries writing down his sermon. After the service the two secretaries got together and compaired notes to put together his sermon as it was spoken earlier.  Spurgeon died in his late 50's, I believe he was 56 yrs. old.  If interested in reading some of his sermons, search for them on the Amazon, or his WEB, or buy a book with his sermons.  They are jewels for the mind. Even his sermons when he was in his late teens are amazing. They made me wonder how a young man can have such knowledge. What a preacher he must have been; reading his sermons makes me wish I could have lived back in the late 1800's so I could hear him.",1338249600,11,1117,4.1336405529953915
4080143,5,B00371QQ5M,"Just as I mentioned in another review of a DVD on Jeremiah, I always seem to think of preachers, evangelists, and prophets as elderly, bearded men. They weren't always old though. This story begins at the birth of Spurgeon and continues with the influence of his father and grandfather, both preachers, then on to his very dramatic calling from God. I've read quite a bit about Spurgeon, but those were words and thoughts of his, not actually about him. I'm happy to have the opportunity to see the whole picture.

Also included were bonus features, ""Spurgeon: A Closer Look"" and ""The Making of"".

As I watched this DVD, I thought it might be an excellent resource for young people. As someone who isn't in that category, I definitely enjoyed it.",1334448000,5,746,4.730769230769231
4080144,4,B00371QQ5M,C. H. Spurgeon did not have a Theological degree but was one of the best Preachers of his time. The movie is good and the extra commentary gives additional insight into his Reformed Baptist views.,1325894400,2,196,4.628571428571429

4080147,5,B00371QQ5M,"You always take a big breath before buying a ""Christian"" film but I'm happy to say this was very well done.  It was a docu-drama, part documentary and part movie to keep your interest.  Charles Haddon Spurgeon is a hero across the board for most Christians yet this is the first movie I've seen on his life.  My only complaint would be I wanted to know more!  I certainly expect many more reviews praising this movie and would hope the makers of this DVD would do more DVD's on heros of the faith like Calvin, Farel and Zwingli.",1311984000,10,528,4.357142857142857

4080149,5,B00371QQ5M,"Interesting and well-done documentary drama of the life of Charles H. Spurgeon (1834-1892), English Baptist preacher, author and editor who also founded a pastor's college and an orphanage. With video of on-site locations, historical pictures, narration and drama, the viewer is provided a historically accurate account of Spurgeon's trials and triumphs and the times in which he lived.

But, overall the events match up with what is presented in Mr. Spurgeon's autobiography.  Suitable for children (with possibly the exception of one scene).

Note:  this is a portrayal of his life and works but is very light on his theological views.",1508803200,,376,4.8125

This presentation was a great blessing to us.  It is faithful to the message that Spurgeon preached, for his subject was always Jesus Christ.  Spurgeon, who was called the Prince of Preachers by one member of the English Royalty,  walked very closely with His Savior and this is brought out in the film.

4080186,3,B00371QQ5M,"For the historical value, indeed you learn a lot about Spurgeon.

For the production value, it feels like what it is; a B-rated documentary that has cheesy re-enactments, and, by far, seemingly no one who compared with the magnitude and supposed fame of Spurgeon's preaching. Granted you may not be able to capture that seeing how no one ever could've recorded Spurgeon to know exactly how he preached, however, the people they did have for Spurgeon's re-enacted preaching felt worse than any Joe you could see behind a pulpit on any given Sunday.

I'll probably keep it, if not just to refresh my mind on Spurgeon's basic history, but nothing to share.",1415059200,4,653,4.821428571428571

Part of the movie is a historian showing some modern key places in the life of Spurgeon while the rest is character re-enactments of events. Very well done (although they could have done a little better making Spurgeon's wife look older as he aged ... his wife on his deathbed looked like the wife he married with some gray hair, quite wrinkle free and absent other signs of aging. But it was more humorous than disturbing.). The only reason I did not give it a ""5"" is because some key events and important emphases of Spurgeon's life was absent, but in its defense, you cannot go into everything in a short movie.

The movie captures his eloquence, the complete dedication of his life to God and the almost unrepeatable manner in which God used him. The costuming is excellent.
