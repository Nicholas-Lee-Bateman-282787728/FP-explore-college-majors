3668270,3,B001KQI5QO,"Outstanding performance by Bon Jovi- as usual!  The set list is great,  however the picture quality is pretty bad.  It looks like someone burned a copy to dvd from a very old vhs video.  The color is distorted in spots and there are lines from tracking problems probably on the original video tape.  I have the Crush tour and Live from London dvds and they are much better quality.  I am glad that this was pretty inexpensive.",1246233600,,426,4.467532467532467
3668271,5,B001KQI5QO,"Bon Jovi Live At Yokahama 1996 Is one of the bands best peformances next to live from london. Yes this dvd is an unoffical dvd but it still has good quality in both sound & picture. The concert takes you through a hell of show with rare songs from the band which you won't find on an offical release like runaway ( normal version), something to believe in, something for the pain, these days, my guitar lies bleeding, diamned ring, damned & the best peformance of the night these days. They boys also show off their great acoustic skills when midway through the concert they go down to a smaller stage to peform classic songs like wanted dead or alive, I'd die for you & in these arms. Then of course there are the classics like Livin on a prayer, you give love a bad name, always & Ill be there for you. I encourage anyone to buy this concert with confidence becuase everything you will expect will be here. A Great concert.",1244851200,,925,4.3526011560693645
3668272,5,B001KQI5QO,This is a great DVD.  ONE BIG ROCK CONCERT!!!!!  A must for all Bon Jovi fans. Jon is fantastic and the concert is one of his best.,1231632000,,131,3.814814814814815
8315825,4,B001KQI5QO,"Overall, if you're a Bon Jovi fan I think you'll like this concert because it sounds good and has a good song selection. Just know that the video quality is not great, but it's okay. Appears to be a VHS transfer. There is no menu. Therefore, no audio selections or song selections. Can only play, fast-forward and rewind to hear a specific song. Displays a black vertical bar on right edge of my TV, but is not distracting, just reflects poor original quality. Sold as new, but I wonder. Never seen a new DVD so horribly scratched. Looked to me like it may have been re-shrink-wrapped. It was the last one in stock so I verified it played with no issues, therefore kept it. Otherwise I would have returned it.",1441756800,,709,4.461538461538462

8315829,1,B001KQI5QO,Jon is great as always love him love his music. I have almost all his concerts. This one however was very bad sound and very bad picture quality. Looks to be a copy. I have to contact Amazon as I purchased a new DVD and this one that I got is very bad quality.,1362355200,,260,3.8333333333333335

8315833,5,B001KQI5QO,"This is a fantastic concert! Bon Jovi back in their prime. The band is tight and Jon's vocals are right on. Highly reccomended for anyone who is a fan. This is their only DVD that features several of their songs live, Something To Believe In, Damned, My Guitar Lies Bleeding In My Arms, Diamond Ring and a great ballad version of I'd Die For You. For a concert that was originally only on VHS this is a great transfer. Worth the money for any fan of the band.",1297468800,,459,4.2272727272727275
8315834,5,B001KQI5QO,This was an excellent Bon Jovi performance in concert. I loved it. I love all of their dvds of concerts. They are such great performers and make their audiences happy. Owning the concert dvds is the next best thing to actually being there only you can see much better.,1285027200,,268,4.489795918367347
