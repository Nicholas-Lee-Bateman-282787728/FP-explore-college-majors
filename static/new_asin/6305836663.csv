3432723,1,6305836663,"If you like boring music and cool video transitions this is the movie for you. I think the editor of this movie was having more fun playing with the transition effects buttons on his new PowerMac than actually trying to get people excited about climbing. Of you want to see the physical strength, agility, mental toughness, pain, excitant, and exposure all inherent in the sport of rock climbing, this is not the movie that will get your endorphins flowing. If on the other hand you like still video shots of lakes, ponds, streams, and flowers this is a must see.",1097366400,4,563,4.64
3432724,5,6305836663,"Beautiful climbing and scenery with very high production values.  If the music is not to your liking change over to the alternate soundtrack which has intelligent commentary from Ron and director.  For the technicaly inclined, the MPEG stream on this DVD averages 7+ mbps which is much higher than most -- so lots of detail!",1066867200,4,324,4.872727272727273
3432725,3,6305836663,"The producers have brought the soft porn tradition to rock climbing. Not that I think the sport has to be about extreme adrenaline with searing speed metal tracks in the background, but this is the opposite: New Age music, soft-lense photography, and pseudo philosophical quotes from the climbers woven throughout. Some people might prefer this, but I found it tedious.
On a more practical note, the filming is all over the place. They don't work any routes all the way through, but flit like a butterfly across various scenes. That's good for getting a panorama of the location, but it would have been nice to bring more focus.
Several of my friends have viewed this, and two-thirds of them liked it.",1054857600,10,701,4.801652892561983
3432726,5,6305836663,"I am a novice rock climber who has never been to Yosemite.  Although I have read many books and seen scores of pictures, this DVD does the best job of showing exactly how beautiful the valley can be.  And if you are a rock climber, the artistry of the climbers will astound you.
In addition to the beautiful photography, background music is played with no voice over. It's much like the music you would hear while getting a soothing massage.  While not running to my taste, it's not bad and overall enhances the beauty of the DVD.
But this tape is all about the artistry of rock climbing.  My limited experience up to 5.10b feels like my muscles will explode.  But these climbers look effortless on much tougher routes.  Of particular beauty are the climbs near water and also distance photography which zooms in close to the climber taken from a great distance and at great height.  Somewhat out of character is the short climb by two females followed by a brief romp in a waterfall.  Anything to sell product I guess.  I know, I enjoyed it.
Be forewarned that not all climbs are big walls with almost as much time spent in bouldering problems.  That might be disappointing for some people who are mesmerized by the clean faces of the big walls.
For me, this DVD is a great experience.  Even my wife with a fear of heights was amazed by some of the shots.  I strongly recommend this DVD if you enjoy natural beauty, rock climbing, or just like soft background music with great natural beauty.",1052179200,8,1493,4.529850746268656
3432727,5,6305836663,"This is one of the most beautiful videos I've ever seen.  You don't have to be a climber to enjoy it, just someone who appreciates the beauty of nature.  Ron Kauk is one of the world's best climbers, and was recently  seen in Mission Impossible 2, in the opening rock climbing sequence (you'll  see his name in the closing credits).  In addition to working with Tom  Cruise on this film, he also worked on the Sylvester Stallone film  Cliffhanger.  In this video, Ron and the director show us their love of  Yosemite with spectactular shots of the park's natural beauty. There are  also many other climbers shown, including several women climbers.  Many of  the climbers climb high without any ropes for protection!  ""Ascending  Rhythm"" is a great title, because the graceful movements of the  climbers are in perfect sync with the rhythms of nature.  The shots of the  climbers high up on cliffs next to waterfalls are especially breathtaking.  You really get a feeling for Yosemite as a magical, sacred place, and this  mood is helped by the Native American music in the soundtrack.  There are  also quotes from the climbers shown on the screen, mostly about the  connection to nature and the environment that they feel when they climb.  For anyone who loves Yosemite or natural beauty in general, or wonders what  rock climbing is like, this video is a must-see.",962323200,7,1365,4.7844827586206895

Although the storyline itself was interesting, I found the dialogue to be somewhat corny, much of the acting wooden, and the music overstated as compared to the scenes it was
supporting.  The music overwhelmed the action as it was so loud that it was obnoxious.
I would love to support the Wachowski sisters but can't recommend this production.  The one star is for the depiction of reincarnation and that everything is connected.  Battles in space are probably as fast and furious as shown, but for viewing, the action was so quick that it was difficult to determine what was actually occurring onscreen, so they weren't enjoyable for me.",1514332800,,734,4.848

The soundtrack was more befitting or a Pixar kids' movie. Eddy Redmayne's performance would have been more suitable in the Exorcist. The only redeeming value was the CGI. But Like Star Trek: Beyond, it was overkill and obliterated the story line. Now, have DAVID LYNCH directed this thing, showcasing the harvesting of humans to feed an offworld superculture bent on greed and profit well out of the field of view of the naive human race, now that would have been a GREAT movie.

A horrible movie with zero tension and chemistry between seemingly everybody involved.

3432885,3,6305836663,"While I enjoyed the film and was reasonablly entertained for the first half,  I sort of lost interest, which is a shame, because I really wanted to love the film, for I like the actors who starred in it.  Channing Tatum's so called ""wolf-ears"" were a little too over the top and very distracting; they impaired my ability to suspend my disbelief, as we all must do to properly enjoy a good sci-fi (and I'm actually rather good at that). Some of the dialogue given to Mila Kunis is poor and hides her light as an actress.  I am becoming jaded with CGI and it's over-use  to the point of sensory overload, as I feel was done in this film.  I think the film would have been much better with more character developoment and a lot less CGI -- It gets to the point that it becomes a meaningless distraction and takes away from what would be an othewise decent film.  By all means, some CGI is good, especially when well done and you can actually see it -  but not when done at a warp speed blur that you cannot even process, as was done here - it becomes meaningless. So, I give it three stars, beause the Actors did the best anyone could have  with sometimes weak dialogue and poor character development.",1512086400,,1199,4.321428571428571

Jupiter Ascending should be a fun film, but it kept getting sidetracked by straining to take itself seriously. It's a mix of that campy Flash Gordon movie, with brief spaceship chase scenes reminiscent of the Independence Day movies, completely ruined with Princess Diaries intermissions and swamped with a hodge-podge of ""over-the-top"" gnostic and greek mythologies.

The ""thought ball"" was dropped a few too many times in this film.

Having said that, I would like to have seen it three hours long with intermissions!  If the time had been given for plot, sub-plot, character,  and tie-in development, it could have been a great film.  As it was, it leaves you feeling like you missed something.

The dialog would have been utterly horrid from the mouths of better actors. The plot was convoluted, nonsensical, unconnected, and ridiculous. The action scenes which were par for the course visually, ended up meaning nothing and caused me to feel nothing as they were serving such a contrived plot. Tatem and Kunis meet for what will probably be the worst performances of their careers. This movie may have actually hurt science fiction as a genre. It feels like the world of Jupiter Ascending was built around the idea of 30 seconds of film where Tatem and Kunis are looking at each, kissing each other, or carrying the other; as if this was an awards vehicle who's plan was to win by emote. Those 30 seconds of film are terrible, and the world that was built around it seems like it might have been interesting if done in a different way, with different actors, and different dialog, and better acting direction.

3432978,5,6305836663,"The visuals in this movie are luscious and some of the CGI battle scenes are spectacular. The plot is somewhat simplistic and the bureaucracy scene was a waste of time. Also the weak premise that a interstellar industry would make some immortality serum from harvested humans - but only harvest them once every 100,000 years - why not just breed and cull them like cattle every generation? That just wasn't all that believable. And a mix of bad science and clever, imagined future science: - like they have the technology to rebuild Chicago in a couple hours BUT when Caine Wise crashes a hole in the shield dome on Jupiter they can't fix it - dumb things like that juxtaposed with the very clever technology of space ships having control surfaces that are only held on by force fields.
Also the story was borderline epic with many potential story lines and subplots but it's mostly wasted. Could have become a series or been several sequels. Nevertheless worth watching as sort of a sci-fi warrior-fairy princess tale.",1496275200,4,1019,4.795454545454546

3432985,3,6305836663,"For us, seeing the Wachowshis involvement is the Seal of Approval but this was not at the level they had led us to expect. The special effects and CGI were dazzling but, frankly gratuitous. After coming  off a SENSE-8 binge, this was a let down. The complex storyline and pinpoint character development of SENSE-8 was lacking. Sure, we didn't expect much of a riveting performance from Channing Tatum, but not form Eddie Redmayne? We would have thought that performance impossible from him but there it was on the screen...Eddie Redmayne phoning in a performance. What happened?

Buildings caught fire and fell down, caught fire and fell down, after a half hour of that I thought we were witnessing a fire sale and that's what it was...a discounted Wachowski film. It's not as though the story was anywhere near as complex as SENSE-8 and certainly nowhere near as complex as Cloud Atlas or the Matrix series, yet those seemed to be put together with tiny stitches compared to this film.

Yes, both Lana and Lilly set the bar so high that any fall from their expected quality is a shock. They are truly great artists and we can draw comfort in realizing that even the greatest artists in history didn't hit it on every attempt.",1495238400,,1226,4.719626168224299

They don't create anything. They just make a living criticizing what other people dream, what other people create, and actually DO.

This gives me hope to strive for my dreams and not give up. The movie used the reincarnation concept in order for the plot to make sense. I think that this was one of the detriments to the movie's message as it assumes a pure genetic atheistic worldview. This really doesn't jive with the positive message of the film. I wish that in such a film with an expansive universe, producers would at least incorporate a theistic evolutionary approach where God exists as a first cause (hybrids can't have souls to put it simply). They could have gotten around that by making Channing's character slightly different with genetics but not the extent that they did. Without this, the meaning of the 2 main characters lives is still meaningless despite the positive message which gnaws at me liking this movie as a Christian. Also, if I were Jupiter seeing the reality of the universe in this harsh atheistic way, I would have flung all morals out of the window. So the worldview issue takes away from the moral part of the story. Bearing in mind that all 3 Abrahamic faiths believe in God, it would probably have increased the profitability of this movie worldwide.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it wasn't all that bad, and in fact was quite good.  The premise of the movie is unique.  ""Aliens"" seeding planets all over the galaxy for the purpose of .... (wouldn't want to give it away).  While not up to her Oscar worthy performance in ""Wizard of Oz"", Mila Kunis never the less delivers an authentic and believable performance as the long lost Princess.  Channing Tatum's performance was outstanding.  He perfectly captured the essence of his genetically engineered character.  As with many SciFi movies these days, ""Jupiter Ascending"" was long on over-the-top special effects and short on character development, but it was visually stunning in any event.  I thought the toilet cleaning business was a bit overdone, but it did serve to ground Kunis' character.  Overall a very good SciFi flick with plenty of action and a moral basis as well.",1483315200,4,1019,4.912280701754386

3433148,3,6305836663,"Very pretty. Extremely cheesy. The acting was not so good. Couldn't get over Channing's weird peroxided hair, creepy goatee and uber dweeby roller blading around everywhere. Plus the eyeliner! All combined made it pretty much impossible to be attracted to him which is confusing because, come on, it's Channing Tatum... and when you're already so lost and weirded out by a production like this, you at least want to enjoy the eye candy. But I digress. The whole thing seemed to be packed with potential lingering in the shadows but that potential was never met, apart from the gorgeous visuals. Space, planets, ships, all that stuff was rad. But I'm going to liken it to a super cool dream one might have. You wake up and think ""Wow, that was such an awesome dream, it had so much super cool stuff. So much happened in it, such interesting and exciting and meaningful things.""  But then when you actually start to think about it to put into story mode, you realize that nothing really made quite the right kind of sense and there are a lot of gaps and holes and not really any recordable logic. And as fun as it was and as much as you just want to go back to sleep so you can see what happens next, if you made a movie out of it and tried to show it to someone else, it would look like gibberish.
I think that if, like others have said, they had spread it out over a trilogy they could have taken their time to develop and express the ideas and characters and why anything was happening at all. And injected some comic relief somewhere to balance the scales. And just to quickly revisit the Tatum thing, maybe they could have put more thought into his character and made him look a little less like Mr. Tumnus from Narnia. Honestly, it seemed like a joke but I know it wasn't meant to be.",1483056000,,1788,4.385542168674699

3433155,4,6305836663,"It seems like nearly every time I watch an action movie these days the plot is the same. A man (its almost always a man) is wronged somehow, his wife and/or family are killed, a business deal goes bad, etc. And then we proceed to watch that man kick ass and take names until vengeance is his.

I will admit that the sci-fi genre has been opening new and interesting stories, especially as the Marvel Universe has made it to the big screen, but at the center of most of these stories there is white man, or sometimes, maybe, a man of some other heritage, but lets admit it, its usually a man. Women characters are stepping out of their roles as damsels in distress, and arm candy and are starting to be part of the action, and don't get me wrong, I will be in the first in line for Ms. Marvel and Wonder Woman, but sci-fi films (Hunger Games notwithstanding) with smart female protagonists are still in the minority and have a long way to go to catch up with the rest of cinema.

[vague spoilers below]

So here we have a smart young woman, an illegal alien at that, someone who cleans toilets for a living is given a chance at royalty and power beyond her wildest dreams, and who choses--nearly at the price of her life--to protect the planets in her jurisdiction rather than have eternal wealth, and beauty.

This is a story of hope. This is a story of the value of human life, of sacrifice and love overcoming greed. This was not another empty mission for vengeance. The one wasn't yet another muscled macho man gifted with inhuman abilities. It was an immigrant woman, a human with flaws and yet enduring strength of character.

The mythology and backstory of this universe were underdeveloped and I hope that was to leave room for a sequel. I would love to return to this universe and learn the fate of the other planets Juniper holds in trust. Will she live a long life like the other Abysians or will she find some other way to ensure her planets safety when she dies. Will she work to overturn the abhorrent practice of seeding and harvesting planets?

The visuals were indeed beautiful. The tech was awesome (anti-gravity skates anyone?!) and setting it in Chicago rather than New York, or L.A. was refreshing and fun. (I loved seeing an alien dogfight run afoul of familiar landmarks in my city!)

Critics take note: continue to set the bar high for acting, visuals, heart-pounding action...but also take into consideration non-traditional stories--especially those that espouse values beyond kill or be killed--and have strong female protagonists at their center.",1482796800,2,2573,4.641758241758242

Third, I could see a sequel to this film in the future because I connected with the film's underlying theme in that one should always be true to who they're.

Does the story merit the film's 176million dollar budget? No (which is another huge factor in the horrid reviews this movie received), but does that matter to you the viewer? Heck no. All it means is that the studio shelled out the dough to make this interesting tale a visually terrific picture, which makes it all the more enjoyable. I liked the fact that the story sought to bring into the fold several cultural mythologies (from dragons, to greys, to vampires and lichens, to gods and goddesses and more) as well as address certain fancies sci-fi lovers are always happy to entertain, such what reasons extraterrestrials might have for maintaining a low-profile, the roll of reincarnation, the history of the human race, and more.",1481500800,,1008,4.935294117647059

3433197,5,6305836663,"Review of the (Blu-ray+DVD+UltraViolet Combo Pack) in the Blu-ray plastic clam shell; all good in those respects.

I prefer not to spend my time writing reviews, however, in this case, I felt as if the Wachowskis were far too often reviewed in a harshly inaccurate and disingenuous way.

I have been a Science Fiction fan for over forty years (maybe more) and plausibly a fairly easy sell. That said, I quite enjoyed this movie and recommend it to anyone who feels they are in a similar or same category. I would however, stipulate that it would be watched at least three times with an open mind.

Certainly it comes up short in many ways when it comes to plot and character development, although I say the same of the Lord of The Rings theatrical releases and the Hobbit theatrical releases (for examples) as well as other movies that were judged on their first release; not enough time to develop either in the amount of time allotted. I had (still have) high hopes of a director release or follow-up releases that could expand on this story however, with the harsh reviews I am guessing that is not likely; sad given the numerous characters, political twists and history. It does (after a few viewings) stand on its own.

To the Wachowskis I would say that they remember how bad the reviews were when Star Wars was first released (Episode IV); you have a splendid new story that you two have begun and I hope you hear those of us who like and love your stories; do not stop!!!",1481068800,,1479,4.548872180451128

3433202,2,6305836663,"The Wachowskis keep trying to tell a story about a special human fulfilling a great destiny, Jupiter Ascending....does not break this expectation.

The CGI in this film is so saturated that it is hard to tell what is going on at parts, and other than that just fills the movie with visual noise.  The acting is at best over-the-top. The movie itself either tries to do several homages to other films, or flat out copy theft of other source material so that an experienced film goer keeps thinking, ""I've seen that before""  The clichs keep cropping up over and over and over again.

While other films have attempted to do serious fantasto-pop sci-fi, (Flash Gordon) JA falls short of the mark of campy and ends up coming across as lacking a strong tone one way or another.  There are no moments where the film attempts comedy and succeeds, its drama relies on so much deus ex machina as to be ridiculous and the structure of the film is poorly executed but has all the hallmarks we've come to find irksome of the Wachowskis.  There is no variation in their fanciful worlds they create no compelling ideology.  They took what is arguably an interesting idea, what if humanity was engineered to look as though it evolved here but is actually a seeded race and that a race that is comfortable with genetic manipulation could walk amongst us undetected, and made it boring.

Finally the gun that Cain has...barks which makes it seem like some sort of comedy, but its not done for comedic effect...at least I'm pretty sure.",1480896000,,1517,4.655430711610487

Personally I'm a Sci-fi geek. I love Sci-fi movies. But this one has a story, and who cares about the romance story, you can't get away from that in nearly ANY movie anymore. It's like the trend of Power Ballads from metal bands in the 80's. Apparently someone told them it'd show how good they really were if the included one on each album. Personally I didn't buy them for the Power Ballads so to me it was forced crap that I didn't really want. As for the movie here, I thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact I think it would've been better WITHOUT the attached romance shpeal. When I watch a movie, I expect suspension of disbelief. It's Sci-fi, I'm not looking for a documentary on absolutes.

Everything is either a remake, a sequel or a superhero movie. I think this was a fantastic idea for something new and different. But I fear the execution was just... not right.

I'd like to preface this next part by saying that I genuinely love Mila Kunis and I respect her and what she's done with her career. But I hate to say it... I wasn't sold on her performance in this movie. I'm not really sure how to describe why... the best way to put it was everything felt very forced. I was just very aware that I was watching an actress, a performer. I also just didn't feel a lot of chemistry between her character and Channing's character.

The script was a little cheesy and the movie was predictable. But I give this 3 stars because I liked the creativity of it. I also liked that they had a feisty, smart, female lead.

The movie itself had tons of great ideas, to much to fit into one film, should of been broken into at least two if not three.  Because of this over reach you get the played out ""girl hates life, girl is almost killed but rescued by a mysterious stranger, girl finds out she is special, girl repeatedly gets into trouble while being saved by the handsome stranger, girl comes to grips with her status and life, sex.  The end"".  Saying that Mila Kunis had a tremendous scene where she learns the root of her families wealth, it was very inmate and emotional, I think her ability for dramatic acting is over shadowed by her incredible beauty and comedy back ground.  All the cool myth and origin story is left to die on the cutting room floor since this movie pretty much tanked and the Wysoki's themselves said they will never get an unlimited budget again.  Movie 3 stars, don't expect to much, but a fun ride overall.

The fourth star comes from the 4k HDR.  In a word, Stunning.  The action sequences are lavishly done.  The sets, CGI and real, are wide and beautiful.  The added color pallet from the HDR adds a beautiful depth to the picture.  The farm scene is amazing with color.  Overall this movie is very very dark, and there is much inner detail in that darkness.  While the added color it is a feast for the eyes.  All of this coupled with a very well done soundtrack makes for some very intense scenes, my system went straight to 0dB and stayed there and I won't lie I was literally griping my seat in some early action sequences.

3433366,4,6305836663,"I confess, I felt guilty pleasure watching this movie.  I wasn't expecting it to be a sci-fi classic destined for historic film glory, so I found little to be disappointed with.  The story itself was a bit wonky (illegal alien [ha!] young woman hiding/working with her family in Chicago is discovered to be an exact ""genetic recurrence"" of a matriarch of a universe-ruling clan who was killed some years before and her children all want the recurrence/girl for their own mostly nefarious reasons).  Mila Kunis will likely never win an Oscar - though her turn in Black Swan was fantastic - and in this film she is ""just fine"".  Fabulous? No. Perfectly serviceable? Yeah, sure.  I've never seen Channing Tatum in an emotionally heavy film, so not sure if he was wasted here or not, but he's pretty to look at.  Sean Bean is fun, as always, as an aging soldier.  I thought Eddie Redmayne was hilariously (and wonderfully) over the top, though I understand his performance was lambasted by critics; he seemed perfectly unbalanced and creepy to me, which was what the role required.  The sci fi stuff/effects are pretty cool, if unbelievable, and the scene at the galactic ""MVA-like"" offices was totally hilarious.  Film of the Year?  No way.  Enjoyable - and escapist - way to spend 2 hours?  Yes.  Sci Fi snobs need not watch.  Incidentally, one of the films main issues - the ability to ""re-set"" your body's time clock to your optimal age/physical fitness - was very cool, despite the methods used to achieve it.",1474416000,,1510,4.757692307692308

3433369,4,6305836663,"****SPOILER ALERT*****
I knew what terrible reviews it received by the critics and the public.  I couldn't seem to rent it anywhere and found it here at a very reasonable price.

I admit that reading the plot I found via the Internet was the bottom line toward appreciating the film.  If I had not read the plot ahead of time, I would have been as lost as previous viewers were.

The special effects and costuming are phenomenal.

I am guessing that the producers were hoping to turn ""Jupiter Ascending"" into some kind of ""Matrix"" success.

As far as the acting, Mila Kunis is a good actress.  However, the director apparently wanted her to be the female Keanu Reeves showing little emotion no matter what occurs to her.  Jupiter never bats an eye of surprise toward what is going on.  She just accepts it with the same vapid look throughout the film.

Channing Tatum brings much needed ""loving protector"" chemistry.  He is as sweet as he is protective of Jupiter while wearing pointed ears prosthetics and other alien accoutrements.

The trio of villains consists of Eddie Redmayne, Douglas Booth and Tuppence Middleton.  They desperately need the reproduction of their mother to help themselves in certain ways.

Eddie plays the most evil as he dies last and Douglas Booth is determined to marry Jupiter who is the reproduction of their mother (kind of incestuous) to gain the earth, I think.  Tuppence Middleton is the middle sister who catches Jupiter first.  Somehow Jupiter is involved in the sister gaining back her youth.  She does nothing ""evil"" and when troops from her younger brother show up, she just turns Jupiter over to them.

I never read the book which perhaps could explain some of the unclear motives of this family.

Just a supposition but I sense that the sister is the most evil of the three as she is so complacent here.

I enjoyed it because I like many of the stars of the film and was able to read the plot ahead of time to somewhat understand the point of it.",1474070400,,1987,4.655172413793103

When I originally watched it, I didn't really like the ending though, but after watching it again after purchasing a copy for my collection, I've come to appreciate it. I realized (to me at least) it's about someone who hasn't quite yet come to grips with what it all means, but is starting out with the small things in life she used to take for granted and working up from there.

I like movies like Moon, Solaris, Contact, Serenity, Star Wars, Aliens, Blade Runner, Supernova, Pandorum, and The Matrix, but this movie was unwatchable. The characters were too young and lacked charisma and presence. The CGI was nice but too fast. The plot was ludicrous. If you could call it a plot. Some have said it's full of camp to the point of being a cult classic someday. Good luck with that. Maybe I am just too old to enjoy this. It was not comparable to the movie ""Dune"" and a young teenage-looking guy screaming commands to subordinates like a general or a tyrant-king or even a spoiled prince was utterly unconvincing in this film.

Whoever directed the piecing together of the film must be a newbie,,  or was just wasted !  It is hard to keep up with in places

 Now a lot of people have hated on this film, and SOME of them, are at least justified. I personally only have one small problem with this movie, so I'll state that first. In this movie, there is an amazing universe born. Not just a universe, but a whole mythology. That being said, I wish they had taken more time to develop/show more scenes of each of the characters and things in this movie. When you watch it, you can very easily see where they could have made it into two, or even a full on trilogy. As a single film, some parts seem a little rushed. But I loved EVERYTHING about this movie still however. It kind of reminds me of a cross between ""Frank Herbert's Dune"", and ""Alice in Wonderland"" where the journey itself, seems to have a life of it's own or something. A lot of the negative reviews have to do with Mila Kunis's character, but ask yourself, ""What would you do in this scenario?"" She's launched into space with no training, no knowledge of politics or social norms. I think she does pretty well considering the fact that's she's just a Russian maid really.

The starscape is fantastic! The music is very Opera esc. In fact now that I think about it, this would probably make one hell of an amazing opera experience. Just saying. The science is believable, and the plot makes sence without being obvious right away. All in all, I loved every minute of it. :D",1469750400,,1410,4.461240310077519

I love the main characters Jupiter Jones(Mila) and Cain Wise(Channing).Cain is suppose to take Jupiter to Titus who is part of the Abraxis family)(I may not spelled that correctly), which includes his sister Clique and his brother( I can't understand his name in the movie). They are a rich and powerful family who it appears owns several planets in the universe along with other rich and powerful people,  which they harvest. They harvest is the people of the planet for more time and store their life force in tubes. Cain changes his mind about taking Jupiter to Titus, in the meantime the older brother wants to kill Jupiter, because she is their mother reincarnated and re-inherits the earth, which was there mother's before she died and was inherited by the oldest son when she passed. I love the story line of  the movie, the action the graphics the scenery and especially the love story that grows between Jupiter and Cain.

I thought the characters were great, but I admit I'll watch almost anything with Sean Bean in it, even when he's playing a bad guy! Mila Kunis was very good in a role that's tough to do without overdoing it. I wasn't sure about Channing Tatum's character at first, but each time I watch it, I find I like him more and more.

3433528,1,6305836663,"The underlying plot PREMISE or this film is interesting, what killed it was the execution. I'm tempted to give away spoilers simply because it would spare some of you from paying to watch this horrible movie (I watched it for free on HBO), but I'll be nice and just elude to the plot. I guess any film which description includes, "" she is the reincarnation of the Queen of the Universe, with the power to control the cosmos,"" should have been a red flag that the movie would be bloated and overdone. Still, I knew the whole plot ""secret"" regarding harvesting and it's purpose, because the film's release had been stalled and a lot of outlets had leaked the secret premise behind it all.

It would have been good, maybe even great, but the filmmakers totally brushed over the most INTERESTING aspect of all of it. Jupiter (Mila Kunis's character) could have had depth do to her loss, and difficult upbringing, but instead the whole thing is glossed over in favor of more explosions and special effects. She's a morally sound individual, who we are supposed to be cheering for because she's trying to bring moral balance to the universe and you know save Earth and whatnot, but then there's this random love story thrown in. Worse, it's never really explained.

Um, okay?

I could probably tolerate the love story tangent, as long as it ran alongside the morality storyline, but that storyline is never developed. It's basically 2+ hours of family dysfunction, explosions, fight sequences that (don't worry nobody will ever remember) and then a groundhog day ending with an aggravating twist. (I'm sorry, but seriously? The tagline says she has the power to control the universe, so why does the film end how it ends?) Even if you buy into the whole concept of, ""it takes a while to adjust to such a revelation,"" she seemed to do just fine adjusting to all of it while she was off fighting battles on alien ships.

Plainly put, there was a great opportunity to make a new science fiction film, with a new premise, and great actors, but the urge to use a whole lot of CG effects clearly became more important than the storyline itself. I'm not sure why any of the people involved with the film agreed to even be in it, I would have tried to find a way out of my contract about halfway through.",1464134400,2,2290,4.591687041564792

This time the middle was not so, off putting, needless, ...ah ... nonsensical, well I under stood why it was there and at least didn't cringe as much. Why they thought this was a comedy in the middle of a dramatic ScFi movie was beyond me obviously obviously they didn't know either.  I have to say that once I had seen the middle before I could just turn my brain off and let that part be a ....
Well just be. And I came away a lot better feeling that I was....maybe, entertained after all. ?!  Any way some of the special effects were great. The acting was good could have been logged as even better. The acting and special effects of the middle as a whole were great but that should have been kept for a different movie. A little subtle hummer would have been more effective and in keeping with the overall serious nature of the rest of the movie. I own this and after a while I may yet watch it again and who knows it could possibly go up another notch. I could say it was possibly a 3.5...... naw (slang)-no. I'll wait till then to decide. Even though it wasn't a great overall movie there were enough parts and good acting in many of those parts to say, yeah I liked it.  No really.  .... look at the special effects synthetic/artificial beings, were great, their acting was great, it's just that middle section needed to be a different movie and on its own probably done well. Lol have fun Rent don't buy ...drive around the block then once your sure buy it.  For some reason it's growing on me......enough said.",1463011200,,1626,4.283387622149837

3433645,1,6305836663,"Long ago when I was a kid of single digit age, the local brats used to (and probably still do) make up action scenarios played out in the local empty lots preceded by the casting of characters, You must be the good guy and I must be the bad guy and off we went with plots and action worthy of eight year olds and  all too many of todays action films.

Anyone who knows even a modicum about acting has to recognize that Mila Kunis is potentially a great actress. She was gifted with the acting gene, a gift not given to many any more, but youd never know it from this turkey where she has little to do but be photographed in close-ups and whisper her lines in a dialogue track that is often barely intelligible.  Kunis has made a few worthwhile films that hint at her capabilities but, unfortunately, the one that might really convince the public of her true huge talent has yet to come along and probably, unfortunately, never will. Its easier and probably more profitable  to make bombs like this disaster. Okay, now I feel better. Ive justified my purchase price.

But to harp on little details like whiny perfectionists doesn't do us any good at all.  As I said before I thought this movie was very entertaining which is what I expect of a movie.  If I'm not entertained, the movie was not fulfilling its obligation.  The visuals were stunning, the movie was fast-paced which basically guarantees I'll be watching it again if just to see what I missed the first time.

I also felt the ending was rather flat, I didn't feel like things were fully resolved and I noticed a timing mistake with the CGI.

Note: I saw the movie in the theater before watching the BR.

I really wish that more folks would've given this a chance since it's obvious that it was setup to be a series. A series that likely won't continue due to the movies commercial failure.

3433673,3,6305836663,"I give this 3.5 out of 5 stars.

I just saw Jupiter Ascending on cable and as many people have mentioned the visual effects in the movie were incredible!  My favorite thing - the flight boots!  What person wouldn't want to strap on a pair of those and skate through the sky?

The plot is convoluted.  But basically it comes down to human greed. Stinger (actor Sean Bean) said something like:  ""The human race doesn't like to share.""  A simple statement but it hits the nail on the head.

On the lighter side Mila Kunis always seemed to be falling and screaming!  Poor thing.  Her voice must have been shot after the film.  And anyone who has had issues at the DMV will howl with laughter as Kunis works her way through a bureaucratic nightmare.

The film dealt with a lot of UFO mythos.  I won't spoil anything here but I got more than a few chuckles out of how the film dealt with various UFO related issues. Wouldn't the X-Files have a fun time with some of these ideas!  In fact the writers of this script included a lot of references to science fiction films of the past as well as UFO related issues.  Enjoy hunting for them!

I read Lou Lumenick's NY Post review of the film and he said the film was ""so bad it's almost good.""  I liked that.  After weighing the pros and cons I thought it was good ride.  Nothing earth shattering - just fun.  And again, the special effects were stunning.

Watch the film, enjoy it for what it is but don't expect it to be a literary masterpiece.  That it isn't.  But any film that can get me to watch it twice has something.  And really - those flight boots!  I want a pair now.",1456704000,,1618,4.260726072607261

3433685,1,6305836663,"I really, really wanted to like this movie, but I can't say anything good about it other than that it's kind of pretty to look at.

I'm not sure what this movie is about. I watched it and I have no clear, concise idea of what it is I just witnessed. The trailers for ""Jupiter Ascending"" gave me extremely high hopes, considering I loved the Wachowski's previous film, ""Cloud Atlas,"" which was a gorgeous tour de force through space and time. So naturally when the first trailers for a movie that looked like it would deliver an equal if not greater story with brilliant, vivid visuals, that is to say this movie, ""Jupiter Ascending,"" were seen, I thought this was the beginning of a big comeback for the Wachowskis. No. I was wrong. I was wrong on so many levels that it hurts. I'm just glad that I got this movie for free with a gift card I got for Christmas and didn't actually pay for the 'privilege' of watching this floater of a film.

First of all, I thought, judging by the trailers, that this movie was going to take place in the future, it does not. Instead it takes a sort of 'urban fantasy' route and presents us with a world where aliens have been present on Earth for awhile and they need Mila Kunis for... something. The film presents itself as incredibly vague and I can't tell you why or what Mila Kunis' character existed for, or any of the other characters in the film for that matter. There's some sort of ongoing theme about genetic reincarnation, and Mila Kunis is the reincarnation of a royal family's mother. There are are three prominent members of this family: two boys and a girl. The girl loved her mother, the one boy hated her and the other boy wants to MARRY his mother (Mila Kunis), or the 'reincarnation' of her, or whatever it is she's supposed to be.

I want to say that the movie is three hours long, but that may be an exaggeration, as it only felt like it due to the flick's poor pacing and confused tone. The movie plays out more like a series of disjointed vignettes that are loosely interlocked by having the same characters. Does that make sense? No? Well, then you've probably got a good idea of what watching this movie is like. Because it makes no sense. The plot is nonexistent but the movie seems to insist that there is, in fact, a plot going on somewhere in it. I can't tell you what that plot is because the story is so poorly told that it just comes across as being a series of pretty images that might be appealing to stoners but not to the general filmgoing public. I wondered for so long as to why the Blu-Ray/DVD of this movie was so overpriced; I thought the quality of the film was so high that it had something to do with the intense price of the home media of the film! It turns out that the movie was making so little money during its theatrical run that it was pulled from theaters and put out on home video and video on demand at jacked up prices in a last ditch effort to regain its immense (300 million dollars) budget. I don't think the studio or the Wachowskis are ever going to see that money ever again.

There are a slew of special features, which are masturbatory in nature. I didn't even make it through all of them because they were essentially the same thing over and over again, interviews with the Wachowskis about how amazing this movie is. Every single time. It was like they knew they were making a bad movie so the publicity people got everybody really hyped up by bringing in a good director off screen to direct the behind-the-scenes stuff and make everyone involved on the project sound so happy to be there like this was the biggest thing to hit the screen since ""Star Wars,"" when in fact it's nothing more than a ""Dune"" ripoff that's underplayed in its writing, direction and production budget that could feed a small country for several months. I am so disappointed in this movie it hurts. I really, really wanted to like it, but there's nothing to like about it. It's a confused, plotless film with no direction or sense of purpose. The picture and audio quality are absolutely stellar, but just because it looks and sounds pretty doesn't make it a good movie. I still have no idea what it's supposed to be about, or why it exists, but I can tell you this: the jacked up price tag on this flick is there for a very good reason, the execs know this movie sucks and that it's a financial bomb so they skyrocketed the price of the home media in hopes of saving face and the budget.

That's three hundred million dollars they're never going to see again.",1455926400,3,4535,4.387633769322235

One of the aliens, who may or may not be an evil being, rescues her. And loses her, repeatedly, in a chase that extends all over the galaxy. The planet Jupiter does appear.

The movie,  while entertaining at times, felt disjointed in it's story line.  Special effects were top notch. Overall, I think they tried to cram too much into one movie and as a result, many of the plot lines fell flat and didn't have a real chance to take root. I think that the aggregate score for this movie of 3.25 stars is pretty accurate.  Wasn't great, wasn't terrible.

I'm a certified baby boomer (57), lawyer an unabashed fan of these guys (no offense, Lana).  The detail and effort they put into their work is difficult to describe, but if you aren't familiar with their brilliance and attention to detail I suggest you watch ""The Matrix Revisted"".  I actually expect to be blown away by their films and I am never disappointed, so if you guys are reading this please continue doing that which you do so well and  like Thomas Anderson and feel free to give the critics the finger.

3433822,3,6305836663,"Yesterday, I was watching a character named Jupiter Jones on television, and I was getting mad. And then I realized I wasn't watching Marvel's and Netflix's harrowing psychological thriller series about a tortured, boozy private eye but something else what's titled JUPITER ASCENDING. I then went on to lower my expectations. Thirty minutes further in, I lowered them some more.

Oh, the Wachowskis, what have you wrought? You must give it up for JUPITER ASCENDING - it is a visual feast, a dazzling blend of CG work and practical effects. It is also a narrative wasteland, a dizzying hodgepodge of incoherent themes and indulgent storytelling and tedious dialogue. They throw out so much verbal malarkey, it's as if you were supposed to have gone in already caught up with a series of non-existent companion novels. It's claptrap worldbuilding. I think I gave up the ghost when one alien character refers to the universe as ""the 'verse."" That's... pretty terrible. There's stuff that could've been excised from the film and no one would've blinked, like that dumb subplot with Jupiter's brother. That Mila Kunis' character is a toilet cleaner earns the movie some points for unintended irony. Luckily, for Channing Tatum, his career is on such an upward tick that I don't think even his crap role in this one can derail it. Tatum plays the interplanetary hunter Caine Wise, a hybrid of human and wolf and (I'm thinking) hydrogen peroxide. Caine is dispatched to seek out and protect the unassuming earthling Jupiter Jones, the aforementioned lavatory technician. Seems that Jupiter's gene print dictates that she is the inheritor of a powerful alien dynasty and rightful owner of our planet Earth. For someone who just wanted to save up for a telescope, that is perhaps overkill.

Cue the fractious intergalactic trade negotiations and the political power plays, and the assassination attempts on Jupiter, and Caine's various manly acts of valor and some wicked moves in antigrav boots. Also cue Sean Bean and Eddie Redmayne, the both of them trying real hard to not make eye contact with anyone. Sean Bean plays a half-human, half-honeybee character, for cripes' sake. His inner monologue during the filming of this probably consisted of his wishing that he were still in GAME OF THRONES, Season 1, Episode 9. Meanwhile, Redmayne delivers his lines like he's channeling Dumbledore circa Richard Harris.

It's been a minute since THE MATRIX and it would suck if the Wachowskis' peak coincided with that movie. JUPITER ASCENDING doesn't find them in their best form. This movie's release was delayed by many months, and this is what they got to show for it? A campy, bloated sci-fi/fantasy timewaster? Worse, the two leads seem neither right for their roles nor have chemistry with each other. There are positives. As mentioned, it's an impressive visual spectacle. I actually liked the wild action sequences. And... and... that's it. It could've been super-neat and a change of pace that the movie portrays the female lead as the opposite of the now played-out kickass heroine. But Jupiter is given the agency of a heroine from the silent movies. She gets pushed around throughout the film and gets herself in these situations where she's about to give up her power only to have Tatum repeatedly save her in the nick. I wish it were someone else playing Jupiter Jones, someone with more warmth and vitality and personality. I'm sure there are roles that perfectly suit Mila Kunis, roles that perhaps don't require her to expand her facial expression past that of stone-faced stupor. And regarding Channing Tatum, well, there's a chance he may've been decent. Only, I can't get past the wack hair and the elf ears and the heavy eyeliner.

2.5 out of 5 stars for JUPITER ASCENDING.",1450483200,,3780,4.995238095238095

Jupiter Jones, daughter of an astronomer and mathematician from Russia.  Jupiter's father was killed in a botched break in.  Her mother, decidedly pregnant with Jupiter, joins a group being smuggled to the U.S.  There she gives birth to Jupiter (named after her father's favorite planet).

Fast forward and we find Jupiter is the direct incarnation of an alien who happens to own Earth.  Ownership of a planet assures both status and resources with resources including the inhabitants as a food source.

The story is fun.  It's not necessarily new or original but the writers and actors managed to make the film refreshingly special.

This is a good Science-Fiction film.  It's got all the elements of a movie you could go back and see again after a short time has elapsed.

THREE TIMES. Same thing. No kidding. Excellent visuals and graphics and effects, and I think this was one of the only movies I've seen in which Sean Bean DOESN'T die. Huge, far-reaching meta-verse, very Wachowski Siblings-esque (Matrix). Next time I watch this I'm turning on the subtitles because the affected accents made dialogue impossible to understand and I had to figure it out the plot via context clues (Yeah! 5th grade English classes come in handy!).

The fight scenes whiz by at such a pace that they're mostly unfathomable, as are a couple of the ship-to-ship battles. The Wachowskis lift concepts from a long list of better movies, novels, and comic books. They might still be able to produce and direct if they stopped drinking so much espresso, but no one should let them write their own scripts ever again. Ever. Again.

The borrowings often become so odd and mismatched as to become hilarious. A concept lifted from Men in Black bleeds into an entire sequence meant as an homage to Terry Gilliam's Brazil. And in case you miss the fact that this is an homage to Gilliam, here's Terry Gilliam playing a bureaucrat! Now back to the super-serious space opera, in which it turns out that the Death Star is a factory producing Soylent Green! Hey, is that Hawkman? Are those weapons named after the game Warhammer?

The absurdities mount. Does a movie with a character named Jupiter have several scenes set inside the clouds of Jupiter? Did you know that bees are genetically engineered to recognize space royalty? Did you want to know where crop circles come from? Hey, did you know that human life on Earth came from somewhere else? Do you want to see Mila Kunis in a hospital gown and gynecological stirrups while a pitched laser battle goes on all around her? Of course you do! The true reality of life on Earth has been hidden from you: you're the power source for strange, hidden overlords. Why does that seem so familiar?

Channing Tatum is hilariously miscast as a gruff warrior who seems like the result of the Wachowskis' fannish desire to see Wolverine ride the Silver Surfer's flying surfboard. Sean Bean plays the Sean Bean role. Mila Kunis plays Neo, The Chosen One... I mean Jupiter Jones, The Chosen One. Eddie Redmayne plays the evil space nobleman in a way that should probably get his Best Acting Oscar revoked.

3433906,4,6305836663,"When I got the DVD of this movie I did not know what to expect.  What I got was a  beautiful girl, and a rather outlandish story wrapped around
her.  See, she meets this guy-alien person who lost his wings but got these flying boots and it all goes on from there.  Meanwhile these other evil
alien persons try to kill her, chase her and her flying boy-friend-alien around the Chicago skyscrapers, destroy an El train and just do lots of
damage which the bad aliens repair no so one would notice (!).  Later she is taken to an alien world (in Jupiters atmosphere!) where she then goes
to another alien world to be made a queen.  I may have gotten some of this a bit backward, because this film at times is so confusing.  I watched
it twice before I found out what was happening.  Anyhow, I won't say more, but after watching it twice Plus I have come to like it.  The girl is
really very cute and the cast in this confusovision movie is pretty good.  There are some very funny parts, and later some spectacular special
effects to see.  I got this DVD from Amazon don't you know, and I got the 3D version as well.  I am not sure the what the girl (named Jupiter)
had ascended to, the Queenship I  guess, though she did not really get involved in the meat of the story as far as the action was concerned.
Her wingless alien-boyfriend was busy trying to rescue her.  I won't say how the rest of the story goes, but there is a happy ending which is
what I like to see in movies.  I decided that though at times I scratched my head trying to figure out this  thing, I now rate this move very good,
and recommend this to those who like complex but exciting stories as this one turned out to be.  FOUR STARS Plus,  Enjoy!",1447718400,,1713,4.2024539877300615

3433939,4,6305836663,"Very interesting motion picture from the Wachowski siblings. Really it isn't possible to summarize or preview for you how odd this movie is. I wouldn't recommend up and buying it if you haven't viewed it first. Many people I've spoken with regard it as hopelessly bad. To me it was something entirely different, namely an original vision. We see that so rarely in movies, and when we do, it so often baffles and confuses us--because movies employ repeated narrative tropes, which here are often violated--that the new does present itself as the bad. You'll know how you feel about Jupiter Ascending very soon, because you immediately get smacked in the face with the contrast between the hyper-mundane world of the heroine and the hyper-elevated world of the cosmic villains and heroes. The latter resembles the scaling you may have encountered in The Chronicles of Riddick. If you enjoyed the insanity of all that, you might be receptive to what the Wachowski siblings give you here. But here, we also have strange and ecstatic romance, and an ending that--if you enjoyed the movie--leaves you hoping for a sequel that no doubt will never appear, not with a reported budget of $176 million and box office of $183.9 million. Perhaps more to the point, with a runtime of 127 minutes, this movie suffers most from what appears to have been some severe editing. I suspect that somewhere is a cut running twice that long. That cut should see the light of day in some format, because I expect it would be both more coherent in terms of narrative, and more effective in terms of emotional impact. Good work, Wachowskis. This is what the cinema is all about.  In particular, Jupiter Ascending hearkens back to the day when the cinema was newto early D.W. Griffith, Abel Gance, and especially the silent films of Cecil B. DeMille. In those days, they were making it up as they went along, because there were no rules to break. The Wachowskis seem to dwell in this forgotten land.",1446681600,,1971,4.780058651026393

I'm talking to the damn endless chase scenes/explosions over and over to the point where you find yourself praying for the damn thing to JUST END PLEASE! Special effects for the sake of doing them as a formula = CRAP! It's as if the Director had an Associate that make a flick and had 8 chase scenes and so he says I'm going to do 12 for no  reason but filler and destroys the Story.  I started out loving the visuals on my 75"" TV but half way in I was praying for the end to the point I ended the Fiasco with my remote as the Chase and explosions were so excessive and long running that I could not take it anymore.

3433957,4,6305836663,"I heard so many bad things about Jupiter Ascending that I was in no hurry to see it.

I was expecting something like the Transformers-- idiotic dialog that only serves to get us from action sequence to action sequence.  For me, Jupiter Ascending was like the opposite of that.  I found the plot so bizarre and convoluted that I couldn't help but be taken in by it, while I found the action scenes boring and neverending.  I will say that there was a weird bureaucracy sequence and speeches about profit and exploitation that was really clumsy.  But the bizarre science fictiony stuff made up for that imo.  I was surprised at the Damsel in Distress theme.  I liked it, only because it's almost subversive now to show a woman needing *any* help from a man.  I love stuff that's different.  Like an alien with an elephant face.  But i could have done without a few of  their creative choices like those flying roller skates or whatever they were.  However..

There's still the matter of the acting.  Let me start out by saying that Mila Kunis is *not* the worst actor here!  The two brothers (Balem and Titus) were just on another level..  Balem (Eddie Redmayne), in particular reminded me of the creepy neighbor/family member we were all told to stay away from.  There was this icky sexual subtext throughout much of their scenes.  And not in a good way, but in a gross needing to take a shower kind of way.  I'm not liking the turns the Wachowski siblings are making lately..

But still.  This is four stars compared to the Transformers, but only two when compared to the Matrix.  If I had different expectations, I may have rated this much more harshly.",1446336000,,1654,4.573378839590443

3434019,5,6305836663,"This movie was a delight.  The reviews were uniformly critical, but I think they all missed the point of the movie.  This was not hard science fiction (although it stands up very well in that category).  This was a Fairy Tale!  This was Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast...
This was not, as some have said, a third-rate Guardians of the Galaxy.  GotG had its issues too.  I think everything this movie attempted to be, it succeeded quite well.
Mila Kunis is not supposed to be the currently politically correct strong heroine.  She is the official Damsel-In-Distress  the Princess who is rescued by the (genetically engineered) Hero who is despised by others.  We cheered at the Happily-Ever-After ending:  You are royalty. Im a splice  I have more in common with a dog than I have with you.  Ive always loved dogs.
Is this movie derivative of others?  After 40 years of Star Trek & Star Wars and 60 years of Marvel Comics, how can it not be?  Many standards have already been well established.  But there are many delightful delicacies here for the discriminating viewer.  The aliens were well done.  The spaceship design was the best ever (and the only style I have ever seen that truly evokes advanced-beyond-our-comprehension).  Oh, and Mila Kunis speaking Russian.

The plot, such as it is, could have used some serious paring down.  There are countless characters who find their ways into the action with no apparent reason.  There are zillions of different species--all creepy and all bad--who exist only as an update to the Star Wars cantina scene. At any time some decent dialog would have done the trick you're instead assaulted with CG. The primary attribute of this bloviating mess is noise--visual and audible.  It claims to be an allegory about waste and corporate greed.  Yeah, and I'm a fish.

There's a wasted performance by Eddie Redmayne--quite creepy--as well as a wasted score by Michael Giacchino.  But the biggest waste was two and a half hours watching this tubby vanity project.",1445040000,,964,4.96875

These aren't ridiculous and are worthy some thought - perhaps lending some perspective on what is truly an important problem vs something vain and ridiculous. Also, the sound design is incredible as are the visual effects.  Eddie Redmayne deftly pulls off a nasty villain and Mila Kunis entertains us with her ""realness.""

3434034,4,6305836663,"I can understand a lot of the complaints people have about the film, but for me it was very much an entertaining ride. If you're looking for the next Matrix film, this isn't it, but I could make a drinking game out of the tropes it fulfilled for reliving the stories my friends and I wrote ourselves into in junior high. If you didn't write cheesey romance stories (or ""fix fics,"" for the fandom literate), there might not be much here to entice beyond the visuals--be that the special affects, the actors, or both--but I deeply enjoyed the flick.

Most obvious con: the writing. Egads, the writing. I found the world-building interesting, but the exposition is often shoehorned in clumsily, and some of the dialogue is hilariously awkward (if well-enough delivered, for the most part--not all of the scenery escapes unscathed when the villains are onscreen, if you catch my drift). I tended to find it more charming than painful, but your mileage may vary.

Most obvious pro: the visuals. As noted above, the special effects are stunning, if less innovative than in some of the Wachowski's earlier works; the actors aren't bad to look at (though I'm more a fan of Sean Bean than Mr. Tatum, I have nothing against the latter, and Mila Kunis is lovely throughout); and the costumes are fantastic.

tl;dr The writing is a little wobbly, but if you like the idea of a futurish secret space princess and a ""runt"" pseudo-werewolf commoner love interest, you'll probably have a good time. He's also not a creeper, which is a plus.",1444780800,,1524,4.743396226415094

After 45 minutes, I had to turn this bomb off. The chase scenes went on and on and I couldn't tell who was chasing who.
The story was so abysmal I couldn't understand that either. Mila Kunis plays a dim-witted heroine who is in forever danger and her strange looking boyfriend is forever having to save her.
All the special effects of this type are really old. We've seen it all starting back in Star Wars 30 years ago. The costumes and the femme characters looked like rejects from Real Housewivees of the Universe. No wonder movies are now suffering the worst decline in history.

The movie was filmed with the same technical competence that they've established over their recent movies. Action, cinematography, and integration with special effects were all excellent.

I mean, it's a Sci-fi movie, get over yourselves and the political crap.  Just ENJOY the movie and stop analyzing. Shesh!

Many movies such as this are badly scripted, I didn't find that so in this case.  The acting was pretty solid, some of the story-line could've been left out totally. The ending made no sense whatsoever to me.  SPOILER:  She owns the earth and basically is the high queen and continues to clean houses and toilets along with her mother and extended family. WTH is up with that!  You have a whole universe to explore and a warrior dude who loves you and you clean toilets???  Yeah, no. LOL...Just me...

3434244,1,6305836663,"The are two positives I will state at the beginning. First is that the movie has good visuals and cinematography. Second is the mythos of the movie, the concept that humans on Earth are the ignorant backwater cousins of more advanced humans living throughout the galaxy is kind of interesting and I wished the directors made use of that.

Now for the negatives.

The characters do not have real distinguishing personalities, they lack any sense of chemistry, and they speak to each other with about as much passion as a couple of accountants going over the day's expenses, which is a problem because this movie relies heavily on long sequences of exposition dumps to explain what's going on.

The plot is just as bad. The titular character, the girl Jupiter, serves as a plot device, being important to the story only through the coincidence of her genetic makeup. Multiple times she is kidnapped by the bad guys of the film, who need her to claim ownership of Earth, only to be rescued by Tatum's character, a superhuman soldier whom she falls in love with because the story needs a romance aspect to it. That is the plot in a nutshell and when you start including the specifics it becomes confusing and nonsensical.

The movie also tries a to bring a little levity by including a scene where Jupiter and her guard have to navigate a long complicated bureaucratic process that will supposedly protect Jupiter, and fails at comedy. A little research reveals that this scene ""homages"" one of the funniest scenes of the movie Brazil. I say homage instead of rip-off because Brazil's director Terry Gilliam is given a speaking cameo.",1442102400,,1630,4.790035587188612

The story moves slowly at times, slamming you out of nowhere with loud, fx-laden action sequences that are a bit hokey at times. The effects themselves are pretty good. Like too many movies, lately and sadly SciFi movies especially, what kills this movie is a confusing, convoluted plot that takes a long time to reveal very little and explain even less. Even the gorgeous Mila Kunis doesn't help. She has a few scenes where she looks gorgeous, but in a stunning, headed to the galactic Oscars way. Most of the movie, she looks battered and tattered.

Overall, it was okay. It's still new scifi, which compels me to watch it, and Mila Kunis is easy on the eyes but neither is enough to make me want to watch it again and I don't anticipate a sequel.

Is it worth watching? Only if you are a scifi junkie and just need a fix in this genre suffering rut we're in.",1441584000,,1237,4.440528634361233

Mila Kunis does wash a few too many toilets but hey, unless you have servants or a cleaning service you're going to be scrubbing away yourself from time to time. More actors should do that in movies. Somebody should start an actors toilet scrubbing society. Or maybe have an annual contest to see which one can get the most pristine bowl...

Ok, so I digress but this movie is great fun so if you're hesitating just rent it already, pop some popcorn and sit back and enjoy the ride!

I think the only thing I didn't enjoy was Eddie Redmayne who is a little over the top but if you factor in the character he's playing and then throw the Wachowskis in as directors I don't think this one was his fault.

This is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once before you start to appreciate it. If you are familiar with the Matrix trilogy then you will find a lot of little similarities, like how some of the action sequences play out and are filmed. Lot's of little similarities in the musical score too. Unfortunately, this also suffers from the same thing the second and third matrix suffers from, too much drama and not enough action.

3434351,5,6305836663,"I couldn't wait for this movie to come out. I think (personally) Mila Kunis is THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN EVER BORN!!!! Yes I put four exclamation points after that statement; she is exceptionally beautiful. And her squeaky clean lifestyle off camera deserves respect! I will also say that (even though I'm a dude) Channing Tatum is handsome and that I'm very jealous of his obvious physical awesomeness. They are both veteran actors that have shown that they are also very TALENTED actors. So this was the ultimate match-up of star power to pull off this really cool video. The visuals and screaming fast action were stupendous!!!! Yes, four explanation points again. There is so much going on in the picture at once that I will undoubtedly watch this vid several times. In fact I'll buy this one. The acting and action not enough for you? Having Sean Bean (or better known as Eddard Stark from Game Of Thrones) in this movie raised the level of star power by a factor of two. I love Sean's acting. After seeing this movie, I find myself getting a bit upset by some of the critics' comments; the movie lacked the ability to justify its huge production cost..? Really? Come on! This movie was the best I've seen in a while. There were other hits, like Mad Max, and Jurassic World, more highly anticipated films that ALSO fell short of the hype...or at least that's what the critics are saying. Once again I disagree. I'm not sure what these critics expect. You have super star power, mixed with very solid performances, throw in a dash of the lastest technology (like, 360 degree panoramic cinematography filmed by no less than eight helicopters) and hours, weeks, days, months of gruelling filming schedules...?!??! What the Heck do you have to do to get a five star rating these days!? Anyway, I would strongly urge everyone to watch this FANTASTIC video. I knew it was going to be good. My expectations were VERY high for this film, and I (for one) was not disappointed! AT ALL! The whole idea of some Super-Race terra farming humans as the equivalent of an intergalactic fountain of youth was a great concept. The very unique cyborg, genetically enhanced, and bio engineered people's running around everywhere, was exactly what one would expect of an advanced race of humanoids that valued immortality and everlasting beauty over all else. And the physical gymnastics, the beautiful Technicolor production,  the amazing CGI, some of the greatest actors of our time, well, I say, BRAVO! Loved it.",1441411200,,2497,4.82051282051282

I think the Washowski's (sp?) put forward interesting concepts, one of the reasons I like sifi in general. But I found this a huge disappointment. This was a triumph of form over substance. It was filled with beautiful sets, CGI, exciting chases, falls,etc. Unfortunately it was mired in a trite, hackneyed plot, mediocre (at best) acting, cliche dialogue, and characters for who I could generate NO sympathy or empathy. I have to at least care whether the hero/heroine lives or dies to invest my time. This was a pretty waste of 2 hours.",1440979200,,657,4.6239316239316235

3434423,5,6305836663,"When I first saw this in the theater, I was very tired and actually dozed off for a pretty fair chunk of the movie - missed the priceless Hall of Titles part altogether. But watching the rental DVD with family later, I realized it had humor and depth, which drove me to watch it again. Each time I've watched it since, I've noticed more details and made more connections that really enrich it. (Details: one of Caine's guns barks, and his brand is the astrological symbol for Jupiter, forwards and backwards. A connection: Caine's question ""Are you ready?"" brackets the story from the point where the rabbit-hole really opens, until he asks it again at the very end.)

The BluRay is visually stunning, although the voice audio is too faint relative to the music and especially action sounds, making it difficult to catch some of the dialog. The Special Features about the characters, effects, etc. are eye-opening. I was blown away by the fact that Channing Tatum spent 7 months with the directors and stunt people developing and rehearsing wirework and rollerblading action. After seeing what was involved, I have a whole new respect for his acting talents, physical coordination, and stamina. Watching the movie, I was really not aware of watching Channing Tatum. This is a good sign for an actor. (Can't say the same for Mila Kunis, unfortunately.)

While the movie is flawed, I disagree with people who say Jupiter never saves herself. Yes, she certainly spends a lot of time being flown through the air or space (not having her own gravity boots) or extracted in the nick of time by Caine, but during many of those rescues she has to cope with extreme situations to make it out alive. And in the climactic sequence, she stands up to the evil character and then spends considerable time and effort getting herself around in dangerous and terrifying conditions, including some that might easily have killed her if she hadn't had the determination and courage to keep going.

All in all, this disc set is definitely worth buying, and the movie deserves a second watch if you didn't get its appeal the first time.",1440979200,,2114,4.786301369863014

Plus what's all this nonsense about Kunis playing a strong female lead, she needs to be rescued time and time again from death or marriage by male characters. We're pretty quickly introduced to some really bad special effects that many 80's kids morning TV shows would have been ashamed of. Seriously kids in the 80's with a video camera would have re-enacted Star Wars scenes better than these professional actors do. The only things that looked half decent were the Gollum rip off naked alien things, but they were quickly overshadowed by low budget lasers and shields, and an Asian girl riding a hover bike from the Ewok scenes in Return of the Jedi with a bad blue dye hair job supposedly representing some kick ass bounty hunter alien or something, what was going on there?

Then you've got the fact aliens on other planets all speak English and act like humans on Earth, including weddings where they say the exact same vows we do here on Earth.

It got some rough reviews and lots of people seem to be expressing a great deal of disappointment with just about everything about it, including the premise, the plot and the performances. But the trailer looked promising, and it was unmistakably Sci-Fi, which is my favorite genre, and so I set aside the time to watch it.  So, after running it twice, you know, to make sure I hadn't missed something horribly important the first time through, I've decided that this film belongs on my fairly short list of the best films of all time. It is visually appealing. Sets, costumes and performers are all quite stunning. These elements come together nicely to tell an interesting, oddly balanced story of good vs evil. The action scenes are fast. loud and colorful. The quieter scenes are appropriately reflective. There is just enough drama to get you thinking about where we are in the universe and why we are here, and the drama is paired with sufficient humor to more than overcome the pathos. It is a little bit Cinderella, a little bit  Beauty and the Beast, a little bit Steampunk and even a little Monty Python!

3434557,1,6305836663,"Watched it with the family one night and we found ourselves trying hard to still want to watch it. We're in a consensus that our favourite character was the elephant hybrid pilot who was on screen for no more than two seconds total. Don't buy this movie. It is a big steaming pile of crap that makes you lose a lot of respect for the actors in it.

I would have given this movie a lot of leeway if it were based off of a book and they just couldn't shove all of the lore into it, but it never listed a book it was based off of and I can't find anything online. This movie is provided as-is and it's a disgrace.

The main character sits there and calls out her aunt on her bulls*** for telling her that Jupiter rising on the date of her birth was meant she was supposed to find love, but doesn't seem to stick do it. She falls in love with a dog/wolf-hybrid with a cheez-whiz beard for absolutely no reason and in a very short amount of time. He's not receptive to it but only because she's apparently noble for having the same combination of genes as an alien woman born so long ago it's not funny.

And how do they discover this?

3434586,3,6305836663,"I've often thought that there must be some instruction manual somewhere, that instructs promising (or most likely, unpromising) directors and writers how to create a sci-fi film.  In this theoretical manual, it starts out by saying, ""If you are making a sci-fi film, first of all, it must be stupid.""  And then it just goes downhill from there.

Sure, there have been those that have gone against the teachings of this manual.  Carl Sagan ignored it when he wrote the book ""Contact,"" and then the director Robert Zemeckis ignored this manual again when he adapted the screenplay and made the movie with the same name.  Evidently, Andrew Niccol ignored this manual as well when he filmed ""Gattaca,"" a film that is so strong that you forget about the genre completely while watching.  It's amazing when you watch a film that actually gives you hope, when you're at least trying to decide the fate of humans.  I actually went away thinking that we have a chance.  Go figure.

But unfortunately, The Wachowskis returned to this manual when they decided to make ""Jupiter Ascending.""  First of all, I thought, ""Why not call this film 'Jupiter Rising' instead?""  After all, when it comes to film titles, simplicity generally rules.  But after watching, I finally thought, ""It really should have been just called 'Jupiter Descending.'""  Because after the initial credits roll, that's all this disaster seems to do.

I needed a 3D movie to test with my new configuration with DirecTV -- a whole-house Genie setup -- and my Sony 4K passive 3D set.  I moved the TV to a room with a client box, and I wasn't convinced that the 3D would still work correctly.  Well, I guess it does.  And it sure looks great.  But unfortunately, that's all I learned while watching this film.  Other than learning that I was right when most sci-fi is stupid, I suppose.

There is absolutely no character development here at all, which is not surprising.  Remember the manual above?  Well, if you're going to make a ""stupid"" movie, then why not have ""stupid"" character development?  After watching the first half, I still wasn't sure who Mila Kunis really was supposed to be, where she came from, and why she's important to the story.  To be fair to Ms. Kunis, however, she's one of the only decent actors here; she does play it straight, which I did find refreshing.  Everyone else?  Not so much.

There are many scenes where I laughed out loud.  One of them:  Ms. Kunis is surrounded by bees -- in stunning 3D, by the way -- and they don't sting her.  The gentlemen around her immediately dropped to their knees and addressed her as ""Your Majesty,"" which for some reason made me laugh hysterically.  Well, if only this were a comedy.

I remember a Seinfeld episode that was quite funny, where Elaine asked something like, ""War, What is it Good For?"" when searching for an alternate title for the novel ""War and Peace.""  Well, I have an alternate title for this film.  How about, ""Jupiter's Stupid"" instead?  That seems more fitting, especially since it followed that manual we discussed above, perhaps way too well.",1439769600,,3086,4.747645951035781
3434587,4,6305836663,"This is one that you either dismissively hate, or really love. I really love it, not as a great film which it isn't, but as a bundle of content that is wonderfully off the beaten path, yet square in my wheelhouse. Jupiter Ascending is one of those films that is unquestionably flawed. It is a big, sprawling mess of a story with glitches here and there. Plenty of people see an irredeemably bad film. But if you can look past the flaws, and if you value the things that this film does get right, then it is a rare pleasure. This is wild space opera and romantic fairy tale in one. In particular, there is a charm and a warmth that is missing from most blockbuster cinema. This is not the same-old, same-old routine. The worldbuilding is expansive and the visual effects are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, putting most other big films to shame. (The weakest ingredient is probably Mila Kunis in the lead role, an example of how surface details can turn viewers off.) That leads to the question, how did the Wachowskis manage to create something this technically-polished, but not spend time editing the story to make it clearer? Whatever the answer, the outcome was unfortunate, because now we will never get to see more of this rich universe in action. In any event, this is one for the dreamers.

3434633,2,6305836663,"The Wachowski siblings are at it again, serving up another big budget visual and aural spectacular.  Unfortunately their script includes so much gobbledygook and weird names it's hard to keep up.

Mila Kunis (""Ted"") is Jupiter, born shortly after her father was murdered during a robbery.  She lives with her mother (Maria Doyle Kennedy, TV's ""Orphan Black"") and their extended family.  Jupiter makes a living as a maid, with a specialty of cleaning toilets (mentioned & shown a few times).  Hankering for a $4K telescope, she decides to sell her ""eggs"" at a fertility clinic.  Thanks, cousin Vladie for the idea.  As she's about to go under for the procedure, the medical professionals in the room transform into icky creatures that look like Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"" only they are fast and can fly.  They aim to kill poor Jupiter.

To the rescue on a pair of shoes that light up and defy gravity comes a man/wolf known as Caine (Channing Tatum) to save the day.  He rescues Jupiter and explains that she is really important.  It turns out there's a big Universe out there and intelligent life has been around for billions of years.  Jupiter is evidently the reincarnation of a woman who headed the Abrasax (wasn't that a Santana album?) clan.  Her 2 sons and a daughter now control the Universe and Earth is up for grabs.

The most evil is Balem played by Eddie Redmayne.  He's ridiculous and so bad that someone should come after his Oscar for ""The Theory of Everything."" He wants to destroy Earth and harvest the humans which are part of the formula for keeping his royal blood young for millennia to come.  If this all sounds like a bad Terry Gilliam movie, you're right.  In fact, you can spot him in the film as the Seal Minister.  The film has plenty of Special and not so special effects and some pretty cool music but the film is just plain silly.  The scenes between Jupiter and Caine rarely work and there's nothing romantic between them that I could see.  Not recommended.",1439596800,2,1992,4.637142857142857

If all you care about is bells, whistles and nothing that seems to come together really, then this movie is for you. I felt it fell short and was really thin, no real meat to the story. ""Jupiter"" just seemed almost desperate at one part to get her lips on her co-star, not smooth at all and that reminded me more of teen movie trying to slip in there but all the explosions and great graphics would cover that up and convince anyone otherwise.

The plot might be called ""Rockefellers""  lin space. The family who ""owns"" many planets including the Earth and they have the same ruthless corporate attitude toward these family possessions as the earthly family (see Ludlow Massacre). Makes you wonder if the current state of the world exists because they sold us to someone??

As the movie opens there is a war going on between the three remaining heirs, each existing in their own little sphere but having a special interest in Earth. To tip the balance they need to find the reincarnation of their mother. Mother has come back as a rather ordinary girl named, Jupiter. She was named Jupiter by her late, astronomer father. The discussion of Jupiter rising (ascending) in Leo in her birth chart was a nice touch. Unfortunately, she does not turn into a queen who can take care of herself and makes the same bad decisions that are so awful you will find yourself screaming at the screen over her nativity. There is also the love interest shown on the cover who is part dog and delivers the comment ""I am just a dog"" referring to his genetic alterations. She answers ""I like dogs"" which, I guess, is as good a start to a romance as any in these modern times. A few cute one liners like that occur but no real comedy here. The two don't ""get it on"" on screen beyond a kiss, but there is one very short scene in the movie of a nude group grope set in a tank of water. It is designed to show how decadent one of the brothers is, but will definitely have junior asking questions, So if you might consider that if you don't like exposing your children to strange sexual behavior.",1439337600,,1905,4.471264367816092

I have a home theater system and with my Denon receiver turned down to -34Db this movie ""blew"" the amp (shuts it off) 5 times in the first hour of the movie. (and no this doesn't happen with other action movies) The dialogue track (center channel) is too quiet, and the effects/music (left and right channels) are too loud.  I stopped watching after the first hour.  I could make another attempt, but having to re-do my system's setup for one move leaves me with a very bad impression.
Whoever did the sound mix or sound design for this film should be fired.
This movie is a wonderful concept that didn't quite finish.  There's a few plot points that need connecting better, it feels like it needs another half-hour to 45 minutes to better explain the plot and connect the film together.  some things happen too quickly or leave you wondering whats going on.  Could be they edited it down for the studios, or maybe ran out of money, I don't know.  Same thing happened in Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" The director's cut of that film explains more and has about 20 minutes more footage and is a far better film for it.
The only thing saving this from a One Star review are the beautiful visual effects, which they clearly spent money on.",1439337600,,1269,4.5152838427947595

The critics are always saying wheres the innovation and freshness gone?  Well when someone comes along and does something out there and innovative its rubbished beyond belief just looks at the majority of the other reviews for Jupiter Ascending.

3434725,2,6305836663,"I wanted to like this movie.  I read many of the critics' reviews and a few of the more critical customer reviews.  I wanted to purchase the movie and sit down for an evening of joyful entertainment, chuckling that I liked a movie that so many had panned.  Alas, it was not to be.  When the movie was over my first reaction was to decide that it was the silliest movie I had ever seen.  I'm glad that I waited a day to write this review because that opinion has changed somewhat.  I still think it was silly but I no longer think it was the silliest.  Now, what I think is silly is not the movie itself but the throwing of so much special effects money at a weak plot.  I can't fault the acting or the special effects or the cinematography.  They were actually pretty good.  Instead, I fault the attitude that there has to be an action sequence every five minutes,  There were so many, in fact, that they became predictable and boring towards the end of the movie,

I lost count of how many Superman type catches in mid air there were,  Several times I correctly said out loud what was going to happen next.  No, don't marvel at my predictions.  They were easy to make based on how many times something had happened before.  That is a shame.  I love the Science Fiction genre but I like the movies to be portrayed more realistically.  One of the customer reviews said that this was, ""...A B movie with an A movie budget,"" and I have to say that I completely agree.  This is one of the few movies that I have not paused it when I got up to get something to drink,  That should tell it all.

I can easily overlook a hole in a plot and am not a stickler for story plausibility but cleaning a toilet when you are princess of the solar system is just too much. Getting kidnapped by each and everyone of your siblings is just lazy story telling. This movie is beautiful and presents some interesting premises but never takes advantage of either element.

I saw this film four times in the cinema and can't wait to see it again - I got something new out of every viewing, and I found the film just as much fun on my fourth viewing as my first.

In essence, Jupiter Ascending is a fairy-tale - it takes elements from Cinderella, Snow White and, believe it or not, Don Bluth's Anastasia and fires them into deep space.

3434772,4,6305836663,"I have to agree with the bulk of the reviews for this spectacular, charming, stupid film. Make no mistake, this is an awful film in many, many respects. The script meanders and bounces around from tedious court intrigue to sleep inducing exposition and then to wild action and hairs-breadth escapes from certain death. Beautiful, talented Mila Kunis is simply awful in the starring role. A block of wood. And the Bad Guys are preposterous cartoon characters. But wait, is that really a bad thing?

Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderfully silly, childishly pure and gaspingly beautiful adventure for what it is -- a throwback to the 1920s and 1930s and Edgar Rice Burroughs and Doc Smith's Skylark books, where the beautiful princess was constantly being rescued amid galaxy-wide wars and swept away on spaceships the size of planets, to battle villains both vile and insane. There's Forbidden Romance at the heart of it, a child's dream of the stars, Gothic melodrama, bizarre bad guys, intrigue, lots of space ships and super weapons and exotic hybrid humans with wings and superhuman strength, and epic battles over giant burning cityscapes. What's not to like? When i was young i dreamed of a day when it would be technically possible to make movies like the wonderful pulp fantasies I loved.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm sure i will watch it again many times.

3434777,2,6305836663,"Here we have an example of where the writers and directors threw away what could have been a great science fiction yarn to indulge their own personal hang-ups.  They've piled ideas that might work as good stories in different settings all into the wrong setting, the wrong time, the wrong place, and the wrong characters; and it's a mess.

They've been developing genetic engineering for at least 100,000 years, but even after all that time, the only way to extend human life is by murdering billions of human beings? 1000 centuries of development, incredibly fast interstellar travel, and a bazillion in habitable planets at their disposal, and they still live in an over-crowded, dirty, chaotic, dystopian city?  Jupiter is one of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the whole known universe but they send her traipsing from one obnoxious bureaucrat to another just to file a piece of paper?  Nah.  The basic premises of the movie are unbelievable to the point of being idiotic, and it goes downhill from there.

They started with a firm foundation of some fine actors and a never-fail Cinderella plot.  Sean Bean is usual brilliant self.  Mila Kunis is fun as the title character, Jupiter Jones.  Channing Tatum is amusing as he rollerblades his way through the cartoonish chase sequences.  There are a couple of nice settings.  That's what the 2 stars are for, but you can get all that from looking at the publicity stills and maybe a trailer or two.

The film includes several interminable cartoonish chase scenes and battle scenes with actors on roller blades and wire rigs intercut into animated backgrounds.  Those scenes are just plain boring.  Maybe some day a filmmaker will think of a way for the characters, through their own cleverness and courage, to change the course of these things instead of just hanging on while the Benevolent Hand of God rescues them for one narrow escape after another, but until then, these things simply do not work.

The best costumes are the ones you see on the title picture.  Nearly all the others are silly cartoons; just nonsensical ideas thrown together in a hodge-podge of wanting to achieve original weirdness.  The same goes for the umpteenth rendition of the Invasion of the Waffle Heads in the menagerie of humanoid aliens that show up.  The warriors really really want to get their wings back, but I can't image why; they're way too small to be an aid in flight and would be a huge handicap in any kind of combat action.

Even the sound production is bad.  It seems that in post-production, they attempted to grab some excitement by cranking up the sound effects at music to almost dangerously loud levels; and of course failed miserably.  Sudden changes in sound volume don't create excitement; they just annoy the audience and make the film an unpleasant experience.  If you adjust the sound so that the music is down to a tolerably loud level, you can't hear the dialog at all.

Then there's the ending.  After spending the entire film showing her great nobility of purpose, Jupiter Jones goes back to cleaning the toilet and making coffee, while greedily hoarding her newly found incredible wealth and cool new technology to herself.  The big difference is that now she cheerfully cleans the toilet and makes the coffee instead of grousing about it.  After all that, with all the wonders of the universe now revealed, for everybody on Earth except Jupiter, nothing happened.  Nothing.

Perhaps the filmmakers wanted to relate some elusive message about how we should love and be thankful our lives the way they are, rather like in the Wizard of Oz; but if so, they've failed.  The most I carry away from the film is two more names to add to my list of filmmakers to avoid.",1438905600,3,3738,4.805946791862285

3434806,2,6305836663,"This film is a great example of incredible vision and scope unfortunately misfiring, but the backlash and criticism is largely undeserved.  Sure, it's production problems are glaring, but there are many moments that show that the Wachowskis really are brilliant, but struggle against the machine and politics of Hollywood film making.

It has been reported that the script was Massive, and production design so ambitious, that is was probably doomed from the start.  Channing Tatum's skill set was not right for his role, and Mila Kunis's role did not have either enough weight or enough fragility.  The plot has been hacked to the point of being a confusing series of nearly unrelated vignettes, rather than shaped into a tight introductory film for the trilogy the Wachowskis clearly intended.

That said, this is also one of the most original universes anyone has attempted in Hollywood since the Matrix, and the Wachowskis' eye for set design is stunningly beautiful.  I just hope they are wrong when they stated that no one will ever fund their films again.",1438819200,3,1062,5.04

Even viewing it through the lens of a young adult film coming-of-age movie, and not expecting a great masterpiece, it failed to be entertaining.

Fights seem to happen just to show off some special effects and have no purpose beyond that.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Jupiter Ascending is a baffling mix of material that is both impressively innovative, and sometimes utterly ridiculous. Jupiter Ascending takes the classic Cinderella fairy tale and blows it up into a big, sci-fi space adventure about a girl named Jupiter Jones [Mila Kunis], who dreams of a life better than the one she has. Losing her father before ever being born, Jupiter grows up spending her days scrubbing toilets in upscale Chicago suburbs, and her nights crammed into a house with her big Russian immigrant family.

The proverbial glass slipper arrives with unexpected horror when Jupiter is accosted by strange alien assailants looking to end her existence. Thanks to an eleventh-hour save by gene-spliced ex-space soldier, Caine Wise [Channing Tatum], Jupiter begins to learn the truth: That she is of royal lineage on a galactic scale, and that others of her bloodline The Abrasax Family seek to do her harm, so that they may usurp her claim to the coveted planet Earth. With Caine as her protector, Jupiter Jones is drawn into the Abrasax family conflict, soon finding herself positioned as the lamb that any one of the three ancient royals may slaughter.

A true Cinderella, Jupiter Jones [Mila Kunis] cleans toilets to earn her keep with an extended Russian family that includes her mother and aunt, her astrophysicist father having been murdered back in the old country. Giving literal meaning to sweeping a woman off her feet, a muscle-bound dude named Caine Wise [Channing Tatum], who wears boots that enable him to lift off the ground and skate between the skyscrapers, takes Jupiter Jones in his arms and zips her between the Chicago skyscrapers.

On a directorial level, the Wachowskis have once again constructed an imaginative world that is realized with some masterful design and visual effects. The colour palette and the different scene composition are fittingly vibrant and epic for a blockbuster film of this scope, and many of the ambitious action sequences are well-executed and impressive, which helps to justify seeing the film on a cinema screen. However, while Jupiter Ascending achieves a certain degree of accomplishment as a sci-fi film and the 3D visual design and an attempt to use more on-location settings, as opposed to sound stage or green screen, look spectacular as you would expect from The Wachowskis, which with certain impressive moments, are juxtaposed to some truly memorable and impressive bits of filmmaking, so all in all, it is a brilliant and stunning viewing experience.

Caine Wise spirits Jupiter Jones to a farm occupied by fellow tough guy Stinger Apini [Sean Bean], who unnerves the young lady by persistently addressing her as ""Your Majesty;"" he's able to discern her lineage because the bees he keeps start acting up the moment she arrives and, as he explains, Bees are genetically disposed to recognize royalty. Any hope that Jupiter Ascending might be designed to make sense on any level is pretty much jettisoned from this point forward, although Jupiter Ascending does get an explanation of sorts as to why she's now to be viewed as the Chosen One. For her part, Mila Kunis maintains her composure and doesn't have quite as hard a time as she had in her misbegotten role in Oz the Great and Powerful. We all now know from the film Foxcatcher that Channing Tatum is capable of this sort of he-man role, while Eddie Redmayne can hope that balloting for a certain prestigious award, will not get my vote, as I think in this film, is the most atrocious acting ever seen and I had to crank the sound up to hear what he had to say, so there is no chance of an OSCAR for him, with stupid over the top bad melodramatics on display here. And to everyones surprise, we find Terry Gilliam [Director] has a bit part playing an eccentric bureaucrat in a distinctly Brazil-like office.

Bolstering things are strong supporting actors like Sean Bean [Game of Thrones], Nikki Amuka-Bird [Luther], Maria Doyle Kennedy [Orphan Black], James DArcy [Agent Carter], Kick Gurry [Edge of Tomorrow] and Gugu Mbatha-Raw [Belle], plus a host of other brilliant performers hidden behind makeup and especially brilliant CGI imagery to create the strange awesome alien characters. They all do very well in making The Wachowskis unique vision into a tactile and believable world.

In the end, Jupiter Ascending is another example of the good spectacular sci-fi genre that we can expect from a Wachowskis film, these days. The talent and vision are clearly there, in their own ideas; with results in a sci-fi film seem to be out of this world. So going forward to even greater height, perhaps the siblings will hopefully  executing in their next project more stunning visions and at least allowing more creative collaborators into the mix. With so much talent and continued support, from both fans and the studio, The Wachowskis should be reaching greater heights in the near future after Jupiter Ascending has been seen around the world, so watch this space folks.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  The 3D version of the film is rendered via a stunning awesome 1080p encoded image presentation on a dual-layered Blu-ray disc with no extras. The 2D version of the film is rendered also via a 1080p encoded image presentation on a dual-layered Blu-ray disc. Both presentations are total reference quality with an impressive range of contrast and detail. The 3D presentation is one of the better 3D conversions I have seen. While the majority of the shots are set-up to provide depth effects, and awesome pop-out 3D effects. Two sequences involving Channing Tatum piloting a spaceship in rescue attempts and one through a phalanx of robots and the other through an amorphous cloud of gases are visually hard to track, as the images go so fast, but they are equally confusing in 2D. It is best to view these Blu-ray discs, to decipher what is actually going on.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  Both the 3D and 2D Blu-rays have the film's original English language soundtrack presented in a 7.1 Dolby TrueHD [Dolby Atmos] track. Fidelity is outstanding across dialog, music, and effects tracks. Effects and music are spread wide and precisely through the entire sound field and nicely compliment the similarly impressive visuals. The 3D presentation has additional audio and subtitle options not available on the 2D Blu-ray. The 2D Blu-ray also includes English: 7.1 Dolby TrueHD, English Audio Descriptive Service, English: 5.1 Dolby Digital, German: 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Italian: 5.1 Dolby Digital

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: The following Special Features are only available on the 2D Blu-ray disc.

Beautiful designed 3D Blu-ray Slip Cover.

Special Feature: Jupiter Jones: Destiny Is Within Us [2015] [1080p [2.40:1/16:9] [6:56] Here we get to see Mila Kunis [Jupiter Jones] talking about her character in the film and doesnt really know her destiny in life and whether there is a better life. Next up is Lana Wachowski [Writer and Director] talking about the Jupiter Jones character and that her life is very unhappy and eventually goes in search of a better life, when Caine Wise comes along to shake her up and take her away from her Cinderella life style, which Jupiter Jones looks towards him as her Prince Charming. We also get to see lots of behind-the-scenes filming, as well as lots of stunts. What is also totally impressive is all the stunning and beautiful colourful Concept Art relating to different scenes in the film. Next up is Channing Tatum [Caine Wise] talking in depth about his character in the film, and also all the different experiences that happens to him in the film in his lifetime. We also get contributions from Tuppence Middleton [Kalique Abrasax] and Eddie Redmayne [Balem Abrasax] also talks about how much they enjoyed the experience of being in a Lana Wachowski and Andy Wachowski film, as well as amazing fun all round. One interesting statement that Mila Kunis says, apparently being their mother, I supposedly spawn three evil children and feel horrible for them, and they are all amazing actors and so much fun to work with. Another interesting comment came from Andy Wachowski [Writer and Director] who says, the film is basically an analogy of The Wizard of Oz and how Jupiter Jones wants to get back to her family. So all in all, this is a very nice little feature and especially seeing lots of rare behind-the-scenes of filming of Jupiter Ascending.

Special Feature: Caine Wise: Interplanetary Warrior [2015] [1080p [2.40:1/16:9] [5:18] With this special feature, we again get lots of clips from the film, that especially features Channing Tatum. Next up is the Lana Wachowski and Andy Wachowski, who I feel are the most eccentric couple I have seen in years, are talking about the Caine Wise character and the direction they wanted Channing Tatum his character to progress. Another bonus again, in seeing even more beautiful colourful Concept Art of different interpretations of how Caine Wise was to look in the film. We also get other contributions from the likes of Jeremy Woodhead [Makeup and Hair Designer]; Kym Barrett [Costume Designer] who both wanted to get away from the old classic horror Wolfman films, as well as designing Caine Wise costumes, to show off his muscular physic in the best way. We also get other contributions from Sean Bean [Stinger Apini] who talks about the history between Caine Wise and himself and how they were in battle together, but eventually Caine Wise betrayed him. The final contribution is from Benjamin Cooke [UK Stunt/Fight Co-ordinator] talks about how he wanted the character of Caine Wise to perform his stunts in a certain way and that they spent over 7 months perfecting the stunts for the film, and it shows when you see clips from behind-the-scene filming, that reflected what they wanted to achieve for Jupiter Ascending, and what fun they had in the process. And so ends another fascinating fun packed special feature, and a joy to watch.

Special Feature: The Wachowskis: Minds Over Matter [2015] [1080p [2.40:1/16:9] [7:24] Once again, the start of this feature we get lots of clips from the 2014 film, but here we see Channing Tatum on the set, talking about his character Caine Wise. Mila Kunis also comments how massive this film is, as well as spectacular. Sean bean also states that the film was very deep and profound, plus other actors say, the film is totally crazy, exciting, has brilliant storylines, also top brilliant action, with real characters and fantastic worlds created. Also a lot of the actors comment about the Wachowskis, in saying, they wanted to meet the people behind The Matrix franchise; also wanted to meet the directors with originality, and fearless in pursuit of producing a film; they have such an extraordinary visual take on the world, and they work with extraordinary talent. We also get contributions from Dan Glass [VFX Supervisor] and again Jeremy Woodhead [Makeup and Hair Designer]; Tim Pigott-Smith [Malidictes]; Kick Gurry [Vladie]; James D'Arcy [Maximilian Jones]; Doona Bae [Razo] and Maria Doyle Kennedy [Aleksa] that they had a brilliant time working on the film and that the Wachowskis like working is family environment, as that way they get the best out of everyone. Andy Wachowski [Writer and Director] makes a profound comment, in saying, that we are all children of the 20th Century and wish there was more original material in the world. And he also comments that he wanted Terry Gilliam [Director] to be part of the film, in being a character that is straight out of his personal film BRAZIL, that is so prophetic and how much he enjoyed having a little cameo in the film. So ends another brilliant special feature that again was such a joy to watch.

Special Feature: Worlds Within Worlds Within Worlds [2015] [1080p [2.40:1/16:9] [9:36] Once again, we get lots more clips from the film, but then we hear from Mila Kunis [Jupiter Jones] that film has so much fantasy, that is reflected in the film. Lana Wachowski [Writer and Director] makes a comment, that space is so vast, that we can project the exciting imagination in the film. We also get other comments from the likes of Grant Hill [Producer] and again Kym Barrett [Costume Designer] talk about the process of creating everything, especially the costumes, that took a lot of trial and error to perfect and Jeremy Woodhead [Makeup and Hair Designer] said he had a ball working with Kym. We again get to see more beautiful colourful Concept Art relating to different views on what the film will look like eventually. We also get more comments from Channing Tatum [Caine Wise]; Sean Bean [Stinger Apini] praises the Wachowskis in how they wanted the film to look and also all the stunning sets they had to work in. We again get to view some more fantastic colourful Concept Art of what the planet Jupiter would look like, especially all the colourful vegetation, that eventually were converted from photographs of Iceland. Lana Wachowski talks about the spaceships and that in previous films they always looked ugly, whereas these spaceships wanted to reflect how rich people travel. Andy Wachowski states that the spaceships, especially the battle spaceships, were based on the Nautilus, in the Walt Disney film 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. We also get to see some of the film sequences that were actually filmed in The Natural History Museum in London. We also get clips from what they call Early Pre-visualization meaning, computer animation. Also a lot of the actors comment on what amazing imagination the Lana and Andy Wachowski have, and when filming you cannot imagine what it will look like, until they viewed the finished film. Once again, this is another fascinating special feature, that is packed with so much interesting facts and visual experiences and well worth a view.

Special Feature: Jupiter Ascending: Genetically Spliced [2015] [1080p [2.40:1/16:9] [10:24] Once again we get lots of clips from the 2014 film, but we get a nice contribution from Tim Pigott-Smith [Malidictes] who explain that the people on Jupiter are what they call Splices, meaning the people are genetically engineered and who are designed for specific jobs on Jupiter. Again we get more stunning beautiful colourful Concept Art on the vision of the people who live on Jupiter. Also as you will see all the characters in the film have marks on their neck, which are all totally unique and in previous sci-fi films, hybrids would all look stupid, well this time they wanted all the creatures on Jupiter to look so much more realistic. We also get more contributions from the likes of Edward Hogg [Chicanery Night] says that he is a cross between a rat and a human; Sean Bean [Stinger Apini] says he is a cross between a bee and a human; Tim Pigott-Smith [Malidictes] says that he is a cross between an owl and a human; and finally we get a comment from Ariyon Bakare [Greeghan] who is the 7 feet tall winged creature and is also a mixed match hybrid. We also get informed that the Keepers are the small alien creatures you see at the start of the film, and basically they are designed to look like aliens that humans on Earth have supposed to have seen coming out of UFOs. We also get comments from the Wachowskis that they like lots of inputs and imagination from the actors and the crew, on how the creatures in the film should look. Once again, a really fascinating special feature, that is well worth viewing.

Special Feature: Bullet Time Evolved [2015] [1080p [2.40:1/16:9] [9:34] Once again we get more clips from the film, but after that we get to see how all the trick stunts are done in great detail, as well as all the trickery that is done via the computers. But we also get more contributions from the likes of Dan Glass [VFX Supervisor] that he feels that they have produced some real killer effects for the 2014 film. We also get more comments from the Wachowskis, saying that we wanted to let our imagination run wild and it definitely showed in the film to amazing awesome effects. We also hear from Tag Khris [Stunt Performer] telling us that they trained on the biggest ramp in Germany and you get to see it in this special and I can tell you it is  huge. Channing Tatum [Caine Wise] talks about his gravity boots and try to work out the best way to show them off to good effect in the film. We again more beautiful colourful Concept Art depicting different scenes on how Caine Wise would look in the film. We also get lots of outside shots of modern day Chicago, as well as lots of outside location shoots that were used in the film and the Wachowskis wanted this in the film, as they thought the building look so beautiful and stunning. We also get to see lots of high wire stunts and the Wachowskis wanted this, instead of computer animation of the actors, which were mainly shot in London, as well as more shots of The Natural History Museum in London, which took 7 months to complete. So once again, this is another fascinating insight into how all the very difficult and tricky stunts were performed and also hearing everyones experience in doing these amazing stunts. And again a really fascinating special feature and well worth viewing. But one thing that is a mystery to me, is that I don't understand the Title Bullet Time Evolved relates to this special feature, very strange and very confusing.

Special Feature: From Earth to Jupiter [And Everywhere in Between] [2015] [1080p [2.40:1/16:9] [9:34] here we have the last of the special features, where everyone praises the amazing unique feature of this 2014 film, that they all feel they have not experienced in previous sci-fi films or seen on the cinema screen. They also say the script is rich and complex and the contributors in this special feature are as follows: Mila Kunis [Jupiter Jones]; Edward Hogg [Chicanery Night]; Sean Bean [Stinger Apini]; Tim Pigott-Smith [Malidictes]; James D'Arcy [Maximilian Jones]; Lana Wachowski [Writer and Director]; Andy Wachowski [Writer and Director]; Maria Doyle Kennedy [Aleksa]; Ariyon Bakare [Greeghan]; Kick Gurry [Vladie]; Dan Glass [VFX Supervisor]; Tuppence Middleton [Kalique Abrasax]; Douglas Booth [Titus Abrasax] and Eddie Redmayne [Balem Abrasax]. But we also get lots more input from other people who cannot believe the Wachowskis come up with all their fantastic ideas and feel they are very geeky, which does show in this 2014 film. We also get to see more awesome colourful Concept Art in how the Wachowskis wanted the film to look a certain way, plus we also get to see some more amazing computer generated scenes for the film, that look absolutely stunning and of course that is why the films CGI is totally out of this world and it makes you believe that it is all real. This again is a really worthwhile viewing experience and something I really enjoyed viwing.

Sneak Peaks: FOCUS [2015] [1080p] [16:9] [2:25]

Finally, Andy and Lana Wachowski's Jupiter Ascending filled to the brim with massive awesome big ideas that does it justice, which is punctuated with impressively staged sequences, that is jaw-dropping beautiful at the same time. The Blu-ray presentations is 100% top-notch video and audio presentation, especially both in 3D and 2D presentation, but definitely preferred the 3D Blu-ray disc. Extras consist of loads of a series of stunning features that have a lot of mutual praise of talking heads with occasional glimpses behind the scenes of the production. If you are a fan of the Wachowski's films, you will love Jupiter Ascending, like I did, as to be honest I was not a great fan of The Matrix franchise. Anyway when you view this 3D Blu-ray release, it will leave you cheering from the rafters. So invite your friends and relations to experience something totally spectacular. Highly Recommended!

3434854,4,6305836663,"The film is surprisingly good but not great, so don't listen to the critics if you are a seeker of your own opinion. I would say if you are a lover of science fiction and fantasy this movie would not be boring at all. For example, the concept, the gadgets, the action and story is fun ; but as for the screenplay, direction and writing the execution could've been tweaked a little bit more to make it a great movie. One thing I would like to point out is the different concepts that make up this film. Alien worlds, alien abduction, ufo sightings, interdimensional travel, fairy tale princesses, greek mythology, the idea of monsters, reptilians, the fountain  of youth, longevity, secret technology and the possibility of things fantastical existing is subtly hinted at visually or aesthetically in a science fiction expression.

3434879,4,6305836663,"Jupiter Ascending is a kind of a comic book adventure. The film is visually stunning and takes the viewer on an adventure, away from the ordinary. Both of the main characters are very likable and the villains are, well, villains. It is a bit like Flash Gordon with elements of the Wizard of Oz and some tributes to the Wachowski's ""Matrix"". The bad ruler of the universe is reminiscent of Emperor Ming from Flash Gordon, and Channing Tatum fulfills the Flash Gordon image. Mila Kunis does well with her transition from ordinary cleaning lady to queen of the universe. Overall, the movie is fun to watch, the cinematography is exceptional, and the story is interesting. I'm not a big fan of extended action sequences and there are a few here during the battles and some of the characters tend to be caracatures. Jupiter Ascending is an entertaining 2 hours, but don't expect deep thoughts, just an adventure.
For me, the added enjoyment was seeing my home town of Chicago displayed so beautifully on the screen. I had been wanting to see Jupiter Ascending ever since I saw the film crew in my neighborhood. The Wachowskis live in Chicago and their love of the city is always evident in any of the scenes filmed here.",1438387200,,1215,4.682242990654205

3434888,2,6305836663,I think most of the reviews I've seen around have covered exactly what's wrong with this film. First the story starts off promising but then becomes the major issue due to lack of context and it's own perpetual cliffhangers throughout it's many character arch's. The saving grace is that you get top notch cgi the world they started putting together was great to look at. If you're on the fence I say it's worth a watch just for the scifi aspect and for staying entertaining.,1438300800,,475,4.6

It's the same reason people hated on (what I consider one of the best films of all time) Cloud Atlas (2011). A lot of moviegoers who happened to stumble upon these movies seeing the way they were advertised (both as psudo action movies) were shocked to find out that you can't turn off your brain during these things, an ideal that the film industry loves to use as a crutch when a film is bad or not up to expectation; it's the less glamorous way of saying ""The Popcorn Flick"". Now, let me be clear, this is no Cloud Atlas; this movie has more depth than given credit for, albeit some story flaws here and there, and what people got out of a selling point was the beauty of the special effects. This film was pushed an entire year back in order to ""complete the visual effects"". Whether or not this is true, the effects did not in any way disappoint. I would consider this the weakest entry in the Wichowski Saga, but with their track record, (excluding the abomination Speed Racer) that's not saying much. Despite reviews, this is a well built cast, a fun movie with depth beyond what you'd expect from headline names like Tatum and Kunis.",1437955200,,1222,4.435555555555555

Theses people put in thousand of hours and etc for us to enjoy a movie, so please if you have something negative  to say about my review or the movie then please don't post it. Now as for the movie, I loved this movie the story was really good once it got off the ground and the special effects and action by both Mila and Channing was fantastic. Only thing I didn't care for too much was the times they went into the whole Russian subtitles . Just wasn't wanting to read them so fast. I did how certain other elements of movies were in here, and I thought that it was very unique (little 5th element little matrix ) nothing wrong with that. So I guess in short if you like a good action sci/fi movie that is different then you will like this one.

I mean lots of machine stuff going on, changing shape, moving too fast and too many close-ups so that it's really hard to tell what is going on. very tiring on the eyes after a while. and after another while you don't care any more. the characters are weak and petty and stupid and I was glad when they died.

My only regret is that I again incorrectly let typical movie critics delay me in seeing a fine and worthy film; luckily I read one of the positive reviews here on Amazon and we just now finished watching it.  Again I must remind myself that most movie critics don't seem to like sci-fi... they love those sappy movies that win Oscars for what reasons I have no idea (mainly because I very rarely ever see them), and have many times panned flicks that I thought were excellent.

What an incredible spectacle and universe that the Wachowski's have made for us!  While it is true there were some parts of the plot that I didn't totally get, I believe I'll gain a better understanding when I see it the next time... I was too much in awe over the dazzling special effects to take everything in all at once.  I loved the casting -- the bad guys were fascinating and completely untrustworthy; the crew of the Aegis were brave in the face of constant danger; and of course the main characters were perfect.  Another element that was fun, was that you don't really know who the bad and good guys really are until well into the film.  And because of some of the bad reviews, I kept waiting for the movie to reach the point where I wouldn't be enjoying it (and fall asleep or just start reading a book)... but that never happened: I loved it from start to finish.",1437782400,,1443,4.402255639097745

The movie is filmed in such a way that every scene, every image, and every frame is one of deep beauty.  Unfortunately, the movie is a bit slow.  The action scenes drag on in such a way that one gets pretty bored.

The central plot idea is quite novel.  Imagine that there is a race of super humans that can restore youth, but to do so one needs to ""harvest"" the planet of all of its humans and convert them into a sort of holy water. If one has the vastness of space at your command, really what else is there to find but eternal youth?

There is a sort of a religious mystical aspect to this, angels and demons fight for the salvation or damnation of the world.  There is also some of the old tyme 1980s New Age alien abduction ideas of half invisible aliens, erased memories, etc.  The Christ figure in this movie is a woman who survives her ordeal but returns to her normal life of scrubbing toilets which seems strange and off.  Again, it is a flawed masterpiece.

3435021,2,6305836663,"At best, this princess space fantasy provides some eye candy for everyone; for the ladies, theres hunky wolfy Channing Tatum, for the guys theres the storys sexy Cinderella girl, Mila Kunis.  Sci-fi geeks will be busy cataloging the dizzying array of references (or outright stolen ideas) to dozens of gadgets (gravity boots remind you of hoverboards?) from other movies.  Unfortunately, though rich in visuals, there is zero chemistry between Tatum and Kunis and moments of fleeting visual originality disappear in the murk and morass of a story weve seen too many times before.  Its a gorgeous bunch of spaghetti thrown against the wall.

True to the brand of directors Wachowski (Matrix, Cloud Atlas), we get slo-mo Matrix fight scenes, cool tech, whacky characters and lots of people in leather (where does all the leather come from out there?  Are there herds of space cows?).  Ideas are borrowed too liberally from Star Wars, Dune, and just about every other royalty in space epic youve ever seen.  Was this homage, or theft?

In a nutshell, the universe is filled with people, aliens, and a royal order, the Abrasax clan; many human populations, like Earths, were seeded to later be harvested for their DNA to create the rejuvenating drug of choice for the high ordersa DNA serum that extends life for centuries.  Channing Tatums character, Caine (as in canine), a fallen warrior disgraced for attacking a royal, is hired by one of the clan to port to Earth and secure Jupiter Jones (Kunis), a young woman who is the reincarnation of the slain mother of the clan.  With the help of fellow fallen comrade Stinger (he keeps bees), played by Sean Bean,  he fights off a cadre of bounty hunters who are after Jupiter, a beautiful, self-loathing young woman who toils with her mother and aunt as a housekeeper, sharing an old house in Chicago with her loud and stereotypical Russian migr family.  The three royal siblings are jockeying for the throne and control of the empire, and the key for all of them is eliminating Jupiter.  As the primary baddie Balem Abrasax, Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) channels Ralph Fiennes slithering Voldemort, right down to the slow and affected voice.  Its such a jarringly noticeable imitationor homagethat its a huge distraction.  By comparison, duplicitous siblings Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) seem downright normal and disappear handily into the thin wisps of plot.

Mila Kunis is largely game, but Channing Tatum has zero charisma, even with lupine-tinged makeup and pointy ears (his character is a human spliced with wolf DNA), and their relationship has no spark.  No wonder when its constantly competing with so many borrowed plot devices and incidental characters.  Neither are allowed to embrace the absolute silliness of it all.

Perhaps the biggest problem is that the Wachowskis have filled their grand universal epic with very high stakes but zero consequence; Chicago is nearly destroyed in an inventive battle-chase sequence, but the aftermath is explained away with no real-world effect; everything is magically restored and the unknowing populace will simply forget everything, and the few who slip through the cracks will be seen as crazy folks.  The denizens of the universe are able to splice their genes with those of animals, which is great fodder for the makeup crew, but there is no context to give life to this idea.  The only original conceit is that these gene-spliced, hover-booted aliens walk among us and we forget them instantly; just as we do when watching them on the screen.

CLICHES:  highly advanced civilizations in the universe, capable of faster-than-light travel via wormholes, still seem to run by our own historic, barbaric system of royalty and entitlementwhich never worked out for our lowly, primitive lil world.  Ideas and props are plagiarized outright (they didn't even bother to change the design of the Stargates)
SURPRISES: Terry Gilliam as an almost unrecognizable civil servant who gives Jupiter her holographic royal seal, which occurs during a sequence parodying government bureaucracy that seems lifted straight from a Gilliam/Python movie
KID FACTOR: Fine for most any age, just enough action and explosions without all that pesky exposition or meaning; very little kissy stuff but lots of shirtless Channing and a few universally accepted swear words

Jupiter, the main character was implausibly naive and kept making obvious mistakes, trusting the wrong people and thus moving along the plot with her dumb trust in everything and everyone.  Her protector, played by Channing Tatum, had to wear some sort of mouthpiece that made everything he said sound like a hearing impaired canine.  The best thing about this movie is Sean Bean.
