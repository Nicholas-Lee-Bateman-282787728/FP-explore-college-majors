8559262,4,B00AYJBRNG,"""Tricky film to place but a first for me to see this relatively underrated Czech film with English subtitles, black-and-white, and rotoscope-oriented animation (much in the vein as Waltz with Bashir and A Scanner Darkly). Set in the backdrop of the fall of Communist regime in Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic and Slovakia), it follows the story of Alois Nebel who is a train-station dispatcher keeping an eye on the timing and arrival but much of his work becomes hindered as he has multiple flashbacks from the past and decides to confront his horrors by taking on a kind of spiritual journey.

Much of the film is very quietly-paced with infrequent dialogue and much emphasis on emotions, facial reactions, hallucinations, and intensity. It also has a strong solitude aura in its narrative that is relatable to a certain degree where Nebel had nothing from his past childhood but now can fight for something in the future to come. The cinematography, the special effects and design scheme, and mood of the film is excellent by all means and it is no wonder why it received much acclaim from London, Toronto, and Venice when it did.

Buying the DVD from the legendary BFI Southbank all made it the more better for 6.99 (a bargain offer for a film that is rare to find) and watching also the behind-the-scenes featurette explaining the method behind the madness made it again stronger in its parts. The bonus material can serve as great semi-educational content for film, animation, art, and media students alike even if said in Czech with English subtitles. While the way the film is presented is strong, the story and pacing lags a little bit by offering a bit too much esoteric aura for its running length and a slightly disappointing ending all at a running time of 81 minutes. While a film of its kind is expensive to do, some input toward the end, a more concise subplot involving a renegade man on the run known as The Mute, and elements of suspense and action could have been done a bit better to the test to create a fuller package.

Nonetheless, some of its emptiness and cold vibe did not completely mar the film's already stellar nature. Thankfully, I hope the film allows for enough attention that an English-language version of the graphic novel be available just like Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis was made available from its original French-Farsi hybrid format.""

DISCLAIMER: Now even though this is an animated film, it is by far one that will not likely keep a child's interests for long. In addition, the film contains plenty of strong language (like the f-word), occasional moments of bloody violence, mild suggestive sexual humour (during a pub scene), and plenty of drinking and smoking all consumed by adults. At best, it is intended for culturally-inclined teenagers and adults, 13-15 and older.",1370563200,,2821,4.883089770354906
8559263,5,B00AYJBRNG,"Bleakly beautiful, Alois Nebel is visually stunning and deceptively simple. The plot seems fairly straightforward - a tale of revenge and redemption in Eastern Europe, set when the Iron Curtain was collapsing in the late 1980s with echoes back to the Nazi atrocities of the war. And indeed, if this had been a straight live-action film then the story might have seemed a little thin...

...but the astonishing animation techniques used by the film-makers enhance the actors' performances and the narrative so that it's simply captivating. The live-action has been transformed into stark shades of blacks and greys in the style of a graphic novel (think Sin City&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City-Volume-1-The-Hard-Goodbye-3rd-Edition-Hard-Goodbye-Bk-1-Sin-City-Dark-Horse/dp/1593072937/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City Volume 1: The Hard Goodbye (3rd Edition): Hard Goodbye Bk. 1 (Sin City (Dark Horse))</a>, and you'll be close). The treatment of light and shadow in the set pieces is breath-taking. The opening sequence of dark forests, sinister branches, stag's antlers, glowing canine eyes and a tumbling, swirling river of chaotic dark water is magnificent. Similarly, there's an eye-watering evocation of a steam train blazing through the night; saturating Alois, the central character, and the viewer in dazzling, subtly dangerous brilliance. Later, a brief car chase through the snow; the scenes set in Prague's central railways station and the ultimate conclusion against the backdrop of a fearsome storm will stay with you for days.
Alois Nebel isn't just about the animation, however. At its core is a straightforward story of a simple man coming to terms with haunting memories from his childhood. Nebel's journey towards a more normal interaction with human society (at the beginning of the film his only friend is a cat, and he recites railway timetables for comfort) is an obvious metaphor for the uncomfortable and incomplete reintegration of the Soviet Bloc countries into a less fractured Europe. The plot doesn't hide from the other aspects of post-Soviet reality, either: coming to terms with the Nazi legacy, the acceptance of justice, the need for revenge, and the taint of corruption and profiteering.
All that, and a love story too, in around 75 minutes.
A remarkable accomplishment.

Inevitably, it's not quite perfect. Sometimes the animation effects distract the viewer from what's actually happening. The translation and sub-titles aren't always entirely clear - the English wanders around a little bit. And when you watch the 15 minutes of deleted scenes then there are definitely some moments which would have added to the film's clarity and impact if they'd been finished and included.
However, those few flaws simply serve to underline the overall achievement of the film. It left us slightly stunned and soaking up the significance of what we'd just experienced. It's one of those art-house films which would stand several viewings to absorb the intricacy of the performances and production.

Alois Nebel won't be to all tastes, however. It's not an action anime. The pace is measured to the point of plodding in places - and silence frequently says as much as the dialogue. Much of the narrative is open to observation and interpretation. It's one of those films where the viewer plays an active part in understanding what is happening. Don't expect it to romp along like a Hollywood blockbuster.
