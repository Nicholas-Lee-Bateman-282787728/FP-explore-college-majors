4428678,1,B004M5R8Z4,"I am a big fan of Warren William. This guy was adept at being the pre-code seducer of women, business magnet, and urbane sophisticate. So here is the question------why would they put out a Warren William Collection with three of his least successful? These are lousy movies. Stinko. Rotten. The stories are poor and the writing is woefully inadequate. The plots were flatter than a pancake.
If the folks at the Warner Archives had any intention of resurrecting Warren William in a respectful way all they needed to do was a set with three strong entries that are representative of his work. Where are EMPLOYEES ENTRANCE, THE MATCH KING, UPPERWORLD and SKYSCRAPER SOULS? I have the utmost respect for Warren William and I don't understand why a collection with his name on it would feature 3 clunkers that he was obligated to perform in under his contract.
My advice is to avoid this collection and wait until there are new offerings which fairly represent Warren William.",1336780800,37,971,4.855421686746988
4428679,1,B004M5R8Z4,"The above reviewer is right on target. I'm a big Warren William fan but these three films are terrible, all but unwatchable. I tried to take advantage of Amazon's buy back offer but after sending back the dvds but before I could get my money they recinded the offer. They were nice enough to give me a $5 credit on future Amazon sales, but that tells you how poor these films are that even Amazon, still selling them for $34.99 retail, won't pay a cent for them in their buy back program.",1314144000,45,488,4.315217391304348
4428680,2,B004M5R8Z4,"Warren William was a great actor, particularly of the precode era, and Warners has packaged together three of his films that are not particularly interesting - a feat I would have figured difficult to accomplish.  Strangely enough, only one film is a precode - ""Woman from Monte Carlo"" - and William seems to sleepwalk through his role. The other two were made just after the precode era ended and the newly enforced production code was really cracking down on any sexual inuendos or - believe it or not - even making businessmen look corrupt or greedy. The cynical truths about life were victims of the code until war broke out in Europe and reality began to seep back into the movies. This lull in reality in the movies really hurt William's career and his chance at playing roles at which he excelled.

There is such a wealth of material to draw on starring William from the precode era - ""Dark Horse"", ""Case of the Howling Dog"", ""The Mind Reader"", ""Match King"" - why did WB choose these??? I would steer you away from this set unless you are already familiar with Warren William and a completist when it comes to his films.",1309564800,31,1127,4.574257425742574
8435549,4,B004M5R8Z4,"You wouldn't be reading this if you weren't an old-film buff, which is exactly the right audience for this mixed collection.  No, this is not the essential Warren William.  These are lesser pieces.  Yet nevertheless worthwhile. The images are crystal clear, though the sound is not (and there is no closed captioning or subtitling to help).  But that really doesn't matter.  The oldest feature here, ""Woman from Monte Carlo,"" could practically be a silent film.  A slow but nevertheless moving melodrama.  The foolishly mis-titled ""Don't Bet on Blondes"" is the gem of the collection.  A fast-paced and witty comic romance.  Finally, ""Times Square Playboy"" is the dud, in my opinion.  Dull, obvious, repetitive, and arguably miscast.  It's hard to believe that the urbane Warren William and the hearty Gene Lockhart are truly old buddies, for one thing.  (My wife and I both felt that the most interesting aspect of this film may be the homoerotic subtext!)  Still, this collection is a welcome addition to any true cinephile's library.",1483315200,,1035,5.089285714285714

I agree that the films included are not his finest, or fondly remembered, but they are rare, and until this release only available for viewing once in a great while on Turner Classic Movies, maybe. All have their moments, and are a boon to the Warren William fan and collector. Following are separate reviews of each film:

THE WOMAN FROM MONTE CARLO (1932) was Warren's fourth film for Warner Bros., and is in the roughest condition of the three. It comes with a trailer, as do all.  Directed by the famous and prolific Michael Curtiz (THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, CASABLANCA, MILDRED PIERCE), Warren is third billed under female lead Lil Dagover (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-CABINET-OF-DR-CALIGARI/dp/B00006JMQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI</a>) and male lead Walter Huston (DODSWORTH, YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE). The plot is basically a creaky Greek tragedy, revolving around a former ""fallen"" woman, and three men in her life, her older ship Captain husband, who's position keeps him away from home for lengthy periods, his second in command (Warren) a former lover who still carries a torch, and the ship's lecherous executive officer (a deliciously evil John Wray, ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, THE MATCH KING, THE MOUTHPIECE) who tries to blackmail her for sex.  Set before and after a declaration of war, during a times when a man's word was supposedly his bond and the protection of a woman's virtue took precedence over a man's reputation, Warren's repression of his feelings throughout most of the picture seem as if he's in a dreamworld, or as a previous reviewer opined, ""sleepwalking."" Too talky, with a major plot point about a stolen code signal never resolved, that except for an exciting naval battle the film seems to drag until the rousing courtroom conclusion, where Warren finally gets to show his acting chops.  The ending coda would never have been allowed on a post-code movie...... (**two stars)

DON'T BET ON BLONDES (1935) directed by Robert Florey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-COCOANUTS/dp/B004P9UWKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE COCOANUTS</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MURDERS-IN-THE-RUE-MORGUE/dp/B0009X770E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE</a>, GOD IS MY CO-PILOT) is a Runyon-esc tale about a successful bookie named Odds Owen (William) who becomes soured on the business after defeating crooked lawyer Markham (Clay Clement), who attempted to cheat him by fixing a horse race. Odds, at a loss for his next racket, convinces his percentage genius ""Numbers,"" and employees ""Brains"" and ""Doc"" to join him in opening a Lloyds Of London style insurance agency. insuring everything from the birth of twins to a champion husband caller's voice!  Still stinging from Odds' rebuke, Markham plots revenge. He convinces Col. Youngblood, a southern eccentric who's writing a novel proving that the Confederacy really won the Civil War (played by the wonderful Guy Kibbee, RAIN, LADY FOR A DAY, GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON) to insure his daughter against marriage for three years, giving him time enough to finish his tome while collecting a stipend he only receives if she stays single.  Odds doesn't realize that the daughter is beautiful and eligible Broadway star Marilyn Young (Claire Dodd, Warren's co-star in five other films, and a veteran of 30 Pre-Code films) until after the fact, so he and his crew ensure that she never has more than three dates with the same man, by any means possible.  The targets include a young Errol Flynn (!) who, while dining with Marilyn has a number of ""mobsters"" stop by the table and leave messages, including a pistol and a pile of ""loot.""  Since she keeps bumping into Odds she gets daddy drunk, learns the truth, and plots her revenge. I don't think it takes a genius to guess how it all ends! The picture quality is a great improvement over the first offering. Warren considered this film, according to his biographer John Stangeland, one of his favorites. He's at his debonair best, has a great chemistry with the beautiful Miss Dodd, and Guy Kibbee, along with the cast of ""characters"" elevate this predictable, but most enjoyable screwball comedy......(***three stars)

TIMES SQUARE PLAYBOY (1936) based on a George M. Cohan play, features Warren as Vic, a very successful man from a small town who finally decides to settle down and marry after years of bachelorhood, with only butler/personal trainer Casey (Barton MacLane, in an atypical role) as a steady companion/confidant.  He asks his old friend Ben (Gene Lockhart, a veteran of over a hundred films, and actually a close friend of Warren's) to be his best man, even though they haven't seen each other since Vic left their small berg for the big city. After their arrival, Ben's wife (his REAL wife, actress Kathleen Lockhart) leaves for a day or two to visit a relative, and that evening Vic takes Ben to meet the Calhouns, his fiance Beth (June Travis, THE STAR,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MONSTER-A-GO-GO/dp/B003WQ5C8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MONSTER A GO-GO!</a>), a popular singer, her brother Wally (Dick Purcell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KING-OF-THE-ZOMBIES/dp/B0050132UE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KING OF THE ZOMBIES</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CAPTAIN-AMERICA/dp/B001RKTMN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CAPTAIN AMERICA</a>), Vic's protege, and his future parents-in-law, the wealthy Calhouns (Granville Bates, Dorothy Vaughan).  When alone after a long evening fueled by too much alcohol, Ben warns Vic that the Calhouns only want Vic's wealth, and they argue bitterly until Vic slaps Ben and accuses him of being a small-town ""hick,"" prompting Ben to end their friendship.  The next day Vic wakes up with a terrible hangover, and when he remembers the argument, laughs it off and plans to apologize to Ben, but hungover Ben is not in the same forgiving mood.  When the Calhoun clan visit Ben before Vic, he insults them with the same accusations.  Will the life-long friends ever ""bury the hatchet?""  Is Ben intuitive, or just a fool? Does Beth really love Vic, or does she still hold a torch for ex-boyfriend football player Joe Roberts? How will a couple of ""half-nelsons"" save the day?  You'll have to watch this zany, cleverly plotted Cohan concoction to find out! The film has the best picture quality of the three. TIMES SQUARE PLAYBOY may not be a ""lost classic,"" but Warren and Gene Lockhart's nuanced performances are an acting school unto themselves, and turn what could've become just another trite ""B"" comedy into an enjoyable and fun little flick that deserves a better reputation......(***1/2 stars)
