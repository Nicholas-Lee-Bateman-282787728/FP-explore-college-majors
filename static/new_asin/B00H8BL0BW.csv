IT WASVERY ENJOYABLE WATCHING",1401408000,,108,4.4
6140210,3,B00H8BL0BW,"This is a film about a murderer, plain and simple. The star is the ruggedly handsome Niklas Peters. We are told this is a `thriller' and yet almost from the get go we know that Nick gets a buzz out of killing his lovers - male or female, normally during a full moon. He has just `offed' his boyfriend and is now in Berlin with a cover story of researching condo's for his father. He is looking for a room share and happens upon photographer Philip and his actress friend `Lillie' the blurb indicates that they are in some sort of relationship but they are not.

Nik starts an affair with Lillie and insinuates his way into Philips' affections but all the time he is planning for them to get to meet God early. Along the way he has some random flings and random killings and we get a bit of an insight into the lives of his soon to be victims. Lillie is doing a play in English with the World's most dysfunctional director which is actually really good, when we have those segments. This though just never really takes off, the plot is so waffer thin that the `thriller' aspect of the piece is all but redundant - you always know what is going to come - forgive the pun.

There is a lot of flesh on show and one full frontal, but that is not what this film should be about. It is also quite short with a run time of 70 minutes which is probably a good thing as there is not a great deal to fill up any more screen time. It is in German with some English and good sub titles, the acting is all pretty good too. But overall it lacks the thrills, lacks the menace which would have made a good substitute for `thrills' and does not have a lot to say - there are some questionable antics too, like running round a Berlin forest semi dressed and covered in blood without anyone spotting him - the rest you can spot quite easily for yourself. This is not a bad film it's just not very good but I still found enough to keep me viewing; might be one to rent rather than keep.",1399161600,7,1965,4.15485564304462
6140211,1,B00H8BL0BW,"The quote that starts this short film is ""Only man kills out of hate, the animal kills out of love."" -Ken Wilber. Lame acting, lame story, Anyone watching the movie is the passenger. Drop me off at the corner because this is going around the block. BORING!",1394323200,8,256,4.468085106382978
6140212,5,B00H8BL0BW,"This is a rather creepy movie with an amazing lead actor who pulls off the role perfectly.  The handsome stranger's quiet charisma quickly wins over both halves of a heterosexual couple, while the stranger's occasional voice-over narration lets you know his diabolical plans.  Niklas Peters has only been in two films, only once with a major role, so don't let this chance of seeing him pass you by.",1467331200,3,399,4.852941176470588

6140218,3,B00H8BL0BW,A dark German video about a serial killer. He lures people by his sexual appeal and at the full moon murders them very violently. It's told through his eyes.,1461715200,,157,4.448275862068965

6140220,5,B00H8BL0BW,"Very provocative, mesmerizing and well-acted serial killer study. Niklas Peters as the killer (this is not a spoiler, it's the first thing you see him do) is beautiful, sensuous and menacing all at the same time. The pair of innocent artists whose lives he infiltrates are also very charming, likable characters, which brings the suspense and fear. The movie is short and hypnotic, very European. Sorry Americans, no chase scenes or tidy endings here. Just a chilling journey, glad I took it.",1458864000,5,492,5.012195121951219
