8645282,5,B00IT79KX4,"Really one of the most memorable movies I've seen in my life -- I first saw it in the theater in 1990. I just recommended it to somebody, and I'm very sorry to see that nobody has bothered to make this available for people to watch today.  What a bummer.",1521158400,,254,4.08
8645283,5,B00IT79KX4,"How they ever got two talents as disparate as Harold Pinter and Jerry Schatzberg (remember ""Scarecrow""?) to make this thing in Europe amazes me. How they got Jason Robards to star in it is even more unlikely. The fourth piece of the puzzle is Lester Bowie, the avant-garde jazz musician, with Haze Greenfield, who put together a score which produces a constant dissonance throughout  the movie.

But the result is spectacular. The film is full of nuances, full of foreboding as  two adolescent friends see the first signs of Nazism taking root in Germany. There is an interval halfway through where Hitler's takeover is shown in the form of news footage over a romantic Schubert melody.

After Hitler has taken over the friendship is destroyed, and Robards is sent to America while his parents commit suicide in Stuttgart.

When he returns to examine a family archive 50 years later, there is no trace of his friend. But there are still lingering traces of anti-Semitism, and the image of a cruel Nazi judge (""Das Deutsche Volk spucht auf Dich!""), originally noticed by Robards on television, reappears hauntingly through the movie.

I won't spoil the ending, which some will see as a triumph and others a flaw, but I've been watching this movie for 20 years, always with the same fascination and admiration.

The classic Pinter structure -- quick cuts of the past interrupting the present, the hero returning to the scene of the disaster -- is exactly like Losey's The Go-Between, which Pinter also wrote.

Almost impossible to find, except as a VHS and a recent Region 2 widescreen movie you can't play on your DVD player, it is a masterpiece of construction and movement.",1500595200,2,1674,4.869718309859155
8645284,5,B00IT79KX4,"This is a cinematic masterpiece that's based on a nearly perfect Harold Pinter screenplay, that's based on a novel that I haven't read. All of the casting is also just about perfect, as is the sardonic occasional musical score, as is the direction, which blends everything together into this harshly realistic drama about German culture, from the Weimar period, to Hitler's coming to power, to Germany in the 1980s, viewing the Holocaust in retrospect. Although it is a masterpiece, not all of the plot-details are consistent with the actual history. For example, in this screenplay, the central character, who is an upper-middle-class German high school student who becomes the only friend of an aristocratic classmate, is sent by his parents to live in America because the Nazis have just come to power and the boy's family are ""Jews"" and know Hitler's genocidal intentions. According to the script, this occurs in 1932. However, Hitler didn't come to power until 1933, and, furthermore, in 1932, there was no certainty that he ever would. Moreover, even most Jews failed to recognize the seriousness of the genocidal danger they faced, until 1934 or even as late as 1938. So, only on an emotional level is this film 100% realistic; but any drama as a work of art is great as art only on its emotional plane, and there is no requirement for 100% literal accuracy, such as there is for a documentary. This is a work whose quality depends only upon its artistic aspects; and, in that regard, I consider it to be one of the greatest films ever made. The fact that it is not available in the U.S. as a DVD is scandalous, and can be blamed upon rotten film critics, who never accorded this masterpiece of the cinematic art the deep respect and credit that it deserves, and on the obtuse film distributors, who didn't even have the good business sense to promote it properly, such as to feature prominently on the outside of the package, the name of its famous scriptwriter, Harold Pinter. But that's just one example. The greatness of this film is its deep portrayal of a culture, and any great work of art, in any medium, does precisely that, it portrays deeply a culture. To me, that is the definition of great art.",1492732800,2,2214,4.738341968911917
8645285,5,B00IT79KX4,This is an excellent movie.  Much easier to understand if you read the book first.  Watch also the director's cut to see his vision.  I bought it to share in my classroom as we will be studying the book.,1440892800,,203,4.153846153846154
