8735649,5,B01648PBNM,"Part of a PBS series, this DVD focuses on handmade musical instruments, along with the people who make and play them.  The segments are a family that makes ukuleles in Hawaii; a trumpet being made for a member of Count Bassie's band; a banjo maker, a drum crafter making a drum for a classical orchestra; and a Martin guitar being made for Joan Baez.  For me, the segment filmed in Nazareth at the world famous Martin guitar workshop was the most interesting.  The interview with Joan Baez talking about her Martin guitar and where she has been with it was very good.  I think this is probably something you would only watch once or twice.  I borrowed it from the library.  As of the date I am writing this, it is available to watch on PBS online.",1470182400,,747,4.416058394160584
