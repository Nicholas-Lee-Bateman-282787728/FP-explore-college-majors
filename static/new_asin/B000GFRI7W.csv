2607615,5,B000GFRI7W,"This set has 5 of the original Christmas classics.

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Santa Claus is Comin' to Town
Frosty the Snowman
The Little Drummer Boy
Frosty Returns

I like 4 out of the 5.  I would rather of had Frosty's Winter Wonderland than Frosty Returns.  Frosty Returns is below the quality of the other 4 on this set.  Frosty's Winter Wonderland is a much better match to the quality of the other videos to this set.

Otherwise this set is worth the money.  My kids love watching the classics I grew up with.",1165881600,40,520,4.468085106382978

2607653,5,B000GFRI7W,"This is the best collection of classic Christmas animation I have ever seen.  These were the big ""Specials"" we kids looked forward to every Christmas season.  Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr. were the two masterminds responsible for bringing these and many other classics to life.  These cartoons were known primarily as ""claymation"" classics.

SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN

This cartoon recounts the origins and upbringing of the man in the red suit.  Special attention is given to his famous methods and how they originated (I.e. placing gifts in stockings, using the chimney).  Whether or not this is how these motifs really started, will be of little interest the viewing audience (young and old alike) as they are caught up and swept along by the magical delight of the Santa Claus story.

Voice talents featured include Fred Astaire as the narrator, Paul Frees (Boris of ""Bullwinkle and Rocky"" fame), and the legendary Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle, himself.

FROSTY THE SNOWMAN

Happy Birthday!  What more appropriate first line could one ask for from the world's most famous snowman?  FROSTY is one of the very few Rankin/Bass Christmas features to be shown entirely in regular cartoon animation.  Yet it still boasts all the delight and charm of the other R/B classics.  Jimmy Durante is unforgettable as the narrator/singer, and his rendition of ""Frosty the Snowman"" is arguably unrivaled.  The classic ending reminds us that it is a tale for children and we are all a child to some degree or another.  This is shown as the evil magician is punished by Santa by having to write sentences stating that he will not torment Frosty any longer (like a teacher would do with a troublesome youngster).

LITTLE DRUMMER BOY

This the only cartoon in the set with a biblical connection.  Although the story of ""the little drummer boy"" is not in the Bible, it still places high on most people's Christmas song list.  And this little story will boast the same amount of meaning and charm as the classic carol.  Although it's quite slow in some places, the pace does eventually pick up and the conclusion is as rewarding as any that could be desired.

RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER

This was the Granddaddy of them all.  It features the most memorable characters and still boasts the ability to captivate each new generation of viewers.  Songs such as ""Misfits"" and Burl Ives beautiful ditty ""Silver and Gold"" have lasting memories for anyone who grew (or grows) up on this.  Yukon Cornelius, Hermey (the elf/dentist wannabe), Clarice, the Abominable Snowman, and all the misfit toys help breathe life into the story and make RUDOLPH the most memorable and endearing claymation classic of them all.",1257379200,,2698,4.926829268292683
2607654,5,B000GFRI7W,My hubby and I were talking about the great classics and he wistfully wondered where he could find them for the grandkids. I purchased this as a stocking stuffer and had great fun in watching his face when he opened it. Thanks for the prompt shipping.,1236297600,,251,4.478260869565218

2607656,5,B000GFRI7W,These movies have a way of bringing your youthful Christmas memories to life. My husband and I have really enjoyed watching these claymation classics and feeling the Christmas Spirit!,1230076800,,183,5.344827586206897
2607657,4,B000GFRI7W,"For those who grew up with this Rudolf classic, there is a great set of articles on [...] by Rick Goldschmidt, author of a couple of great books on the Rankin and Bass studio. He notes that, ""In 1998, Classic Media's then President Alexander Drosin asked Arthur Rankin, Jr. to do an introduction for the DVD release of both RUDOLPH and FROSTY THE SNOWMAN. Mr. Rankin graciously agreed to participate in exchange for the RANKIN/BASS name to be carried on the DVD front cover (which it was)"" but then Drosin left and the new staff at Classic Media decided to make changes.

The 1998 version had the addition of an original song (Fame and Fortune) and some scene material that had been cut in later tv versions. This 2007 version cut out the restored song and scenes to make room for Destiny's Child...as well as cut the rare piece with Mr. Rankin.

What were they thinking...Geez...So for real enthusiasts of Rankin and Bass, this is a shame...but for youngsters and young at heart, the story and animation is still tops.",1228003200,2,1019,4.655555555555556
2607678,1,B000GFRI7W,All you have to do is look at the box. IT says 6 classics I don't know why this isn't being pointed out. I bought this set as advertised from MIRMEDIA_MOVIES_AND_MUSIC but there is no cricket on the hearth in this set. After I got a nasty email back from them telling me I was wrong they found out I was right and said they would make it right and here I am 2 weeks later and the company won't respond. Just be careful who you buy from. This is clearly false advertising maybe the good reviews are old. Anyway I would suggest buying the other set so you don't get ripped off. The company I bought from is MIRMEDIA_MOVIES_AND_MUSIC.Just make sure the company you are buying from has the 6 classics as advertised.,1227744000,3,711,4.313432835820896
2607679,3,B000GFRI7W,"All in all this is a nice collection.  The quality of Rudolph, Frosty and Santa Clause seem to be worthy of a DVD (and let's face it - the originals are all 30+ years old).  However, The Little Drummer Boy appears to have been video-taped from a TV with an antenna on the roof.  The quality is simply BAD.  The frames are grainy, fuzzy and blurred, and the text frames are simply unreadable.  I can't believe someone would actually have the brass to SELL this abomination - I wouldn't give it away, it's so bad.

Don't get me wrong - overall the collection is very nice and brings back most of the Christmas TV specials we grew up with.  It's just a shame that the producers didn't do a better job re-mastering the Drummer Boy.",1227225600,,727,4.340740740740741

2607708,1,B000GFRI7W,"The packaging is well thought out.  I give it an A+!  I purposely bought this set BECAUSE of the music CD with the songs from the specials.  Very catchy songs.  This set costs $7.00 more just for the ""Bonus Music CD"".
  WARNING the music IS NOT the original actors singing!!  But other people who sound NOTHING like Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney etc.  VERY disappointing!  I and you should feel deceived!  They should state clearly in the description it is not with the original actors.
  Regarding the question of royalties, they are using the character likenesses anyway.  So why ruin these songs?  I was very excited to get the songs and you can imagine my severe let down.  I feel ripped off.
  I assumed each song on the DVD's would be its own chapter.  Wrong!  They didn't even bother to do this so we can repeat a song or section of the DVD without using a-b repeat.  Disappointing again.
  If someone told me I will own these specials when I ""grow-up"", I would have replied no-way.  Back then (1970's) it seemed like a miracle.
  The DVD's look great, BUT the music CD S**ks!!

2607712,4,B000GFRI7W,"Great combination of shows just as remembered them.  Don't think I would consider ""Cricket on the Hearth"" to be a classic but it is decent.  Unfortunately I can't say the same for ""Frosty Returns"", its practically un-watchable.  Fortunately the remainder of the set more than makes up for this poor selection.

The only other complaint is the music video by Destinys Child and the previews you have to sit through to get to the Frosty program.  On the preview couldn't even skip straight to menu, fortunately fast forward works.",1198800000,,528,4.887640449438202

2607716,4,B000GFRI7W,"Nice to see all the classics in one box, but I think it would have thematically fit in better to include ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" rather than ""Frosty the Snowman,"" as the set favors the stop-motion animation of the 70s.  Nevertheless, kids will greatly enjoy this set, which also includes a separate DVD of ""Cricket on the Hearth.""  The storybook box was a great idea.  It is durable and should hold up for several Christmases.  ""Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town"" remains my favorite.  Good story and great music propel this 40 minute episode.  Not a whole lot in the way of extras, other than a short CD of favorite Christmas songs, but then the movies pretty much speak for themselves.",1197936000,,692,4.585365853658536

I had no idea that the ""one hour"" showing of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer that I have been watching on television with my four children all these years- with commercials to boot- is really 68 minutes in it's original form!

Usually I wait until ABC Family channel to start their ""25 days of Christmas"" and then I'll decorate my tree while watching a Rankin/Bass inspired Christmas special. This year I thought, why wait!?! Yes I'm almost 40 years old and my stepdaughter is grown and out of the house, but it didn't matter. I've always been and always will be a kid at heart and my love for these Christmas specials will never deminish. Seeing Rudolph and Frosty again always makes me feel warm and full of love for this time of year. ""Santa Claus is coming to town"" is one of my favorites and I haven't seen ""The Little Drummer Boy"" in years. It brought a tear to my eye!""The Crichet on the Hearth"" was a pleasant suprise as I've never seen it before. The only low point and the reason I'm NOT giving this set five stars is ""Frosty Returns"". I've never been able to watch this one all the way through and this time was no exception. I tried, but had to turn it off after 10 minutes, its that bad!!! The other reviewer was right. ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" would have been a smarter choice to follow up the classic ""Frosty the Snowman"".

However, making me sit through eight minutes of previews...not even previews...make that eight minutes of ""behind the scenes"" of some completely unrelated cartoon, complete with interviews, is absolutely insulting.  I understand that the $5.99 DVD's at Wal-Mart are going to have previews, but even those allow you to bypass them with the menu button.  Not here.

2607785,5,B000GFRI7W,I ordered this collection just before Christmas.  I had my nephews ages 8 and 11 over along with my older children - ages 14 and 17 along with several of their friends.  We all cuddled up and watched these family favorites.  All age groups had a wonderful time!  These classics are always winners!,1168300800,,297,4.547169811320755

2607787,3,B000GFRI7W,"Hi there chemikalguy. It stops when people stop purchasing these videos and giving the trash they show on TV today the ratings they do not deserve. Unfortunately, street trash rules these days. If the Destiny's Child video in the context of the video it was on is inappropriate to you (and I agree), take the time to call or write the company that put it out and state your concern. If enough people speak out, the studio would listen.

You have to understand, todays entertainment is run by mindless executives who can only profit by releasing these original shows and then throw an unoriginal idea in the mix because they think it will sell more copies. The end result is very awkward as seen on the ""Rudolph"" DVD and ""Santa Claus"" DVD. It kind of like going to a classy party, and you show up in jeans and a T-shirt and then actually think you look the best at that party. It doesn't work. ""Rudolph"" is the mansion, while the Destiny's Child video is the trailer next to that mansion.",1166745600,5,987,4.483333333333333

8131436,1,B000GFRI7W,"I did not receive ""The original Television Christmas Classics"". Instead I got a single ""Rudolph the red nose reindeer"" DVD. Since I definitely  did not pay $54.00 for a single Rudolph DVD, now i have to return the incorrect shipment and get my money back. This is very inconvenient since Christmas is right around the corner,and now i have to find the correct DVD once again. I will not be re-ordering the Christmas collection set since I have no way of knowing if my order will be messed up again.",1418515200,,498,4.533333333333333
