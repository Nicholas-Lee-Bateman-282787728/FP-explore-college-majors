8215345,5,B000UWJ4G4,"Anton Kutter, a German filmmaker and amateur astronomer, produced WELTRAUMSCHIFF 1 STARTET at a Bavarian film studio in 1937. Amazingly, it's available on DVD from the US National Archives, and while the translated title gets the release date wrong by ten years, it still makes for impressive viewing. The film is framed around the launching of a manned rocket flight in 1963, being broadcast via television (which Germany was already using for propaganda in the 1930s). Parts of the film are amusingly quaint: the tubby spaceship being hauled out of an airship hangar, the flight crew waddling to the vehicle in sheepskin flying gear. But the visualizations of spaceflight are startlingly good for the time; the film overall is an ambitious attempt to anticipate future events, and (significantly) without the bombast so prevalent in most German cinema of the time.
