2128091,5,B0002W2JP0,"I'm going to skip the politics and focus on the movie. I thought this movie did a good job at showing life and death on a riverboat in South Vietnam. It is a story told by the veterans involved. Whether you love or hate John Kerry or are pro or against the war, this movie will give you some insight into what it was like to be on a riverboat. I thought it was a tribute to those involved without a bunch of flag waving or defeatism which seems to accompany so many stories in regards to the Vietnam War. Listen to the men talk and you realize that their experience was great and yet horrible at the same time.",1399939200,8,610,4.091666666666667
2128092,3,B0002W2JP0,"The movie was interesting at first, but I was perplexed to read the credits at the end and only find J Kerry's name.
Found it an enourmous injustice with the other members of his team on the PT boat and all the work they went through, exposing their lives.
Shame on the makers !!!",1386460800,4,280,4.203703703703703
2128093,1,B0002W2JP0,"Having read the opinions of some of the other reviewers I could not let some of the absolutely stupid commentary go unanswered.

It is ludicrous to believe that five or six veterans who served with Lt Kerry for less than 120 days 35 years ago are more honest than several hundred decorated combat veterans and dozens of former POW's. The Pro Kerry minority of course have served a lot longer on Johns payroll  than they ever served with him in his brief combat career. The hundreds of anti Kerry vets spent a lot more than 120 days in theater and have earned the right to speak up.  Those of us who are Viet Nam era veterans felt very much betrayed by Lt Kerry and cannot stand by to see him become Commander and Chief of the armed forces he so dishonored. The actions of the Swiftboat Veterans for Truth have nothing to do with their being pro Bush  and everything to do with being anti traitor.  Their conduct is far from shameful as another reviewer suggested. Lt Kerry's picture hangs in a Hanoi museum as a tribute to his anti american pro Viet Cong activities. In the 1985 memoirs of North Vietnam General Giap he plainly states that North Viet Nam would have surrendered were it not for the discord created in this country by Kerry and his ilk. His testimony before congress and the activities of the group he lead caused the deaths and torture of countless soldiers and airmen.  Contrary to one of the reviewers statements Kerry has NOT authorized the release of his military records and the media seems unconcerned and willing to accept only what Kerry makes available on his website and call it full disclosure(wow!). Anyone who buys this DVD is already predisposed to believing this crap and has probably already bought the Crockumentary(spelling intentional) Fahrenheit 9/11. Enjoy your Kool-Aid!",1098230400,30,1808,4.723809523809524
2128094,5,B0002W2JP0,"The title of this movie is Brothers in Arms.  ""John Kerry"" is not in the title (as shown here on Amazon).  David Alston, Mike Medeiros, Del Sandusky, Gene Thorson, and John Kerry tell the stories of what Vietnam was like for them and what happened when they went home.  Even if John Kerry were not running for president, their collective stories are moving and worthwhile.  This movie is not about republicans and democrats.  I want to thank these men for having the courage to tell us about themselves.  These stories are important and need to be heard.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart for telling them.",1098144000,29,611,4.601851851851852
2128095,5,B0002W2JP0,"Again, everybody has opinions about John Kerry and coming back to protest the war which Bush wouldn't even serve in.  Kerry was there and makes a very sound argument why it should have been protested.  It was STUPID!!  The N. Vietnamese could care less about the Soviets and Chinese and were fighting for their own freedom---AGAINST US!! the so-called spreaders of freedom and liberty. Let's just face it--sometimes America is wrong.

The superb irony is that all the so-called Republicans Hawks are really Chickenhawks that didn't serve and actively slipped out of service.  If Bush really wanted to serve, all he had to do was go down to the recruiter's station and they would have gladly accepted him. Instead, he got his dad to pull some strings to get in the guard so he wouldn't have to serve.  These are the facts and they are undisputable.",1097798400,37,847,4.767123287671233
2128096,1,B0002W2JP0,"What some people forget, is that Vietnam war protestors were going against the democratically elected and supported position at that time. The protesters felt their opinion was superior to the elected majority. Supporters of phased withdrawal (read Kissinger' latest book and the 200 some swift boat veterans book) still feel subjected to treason and anguish at what happened to all those people.  The millions of Cambodians and south vietnamese who were hoping for something other than communism were wiped out thanks to an agitated, nasty exit from an almost unwinnable war. (If you begin doubting yourself, country, and ideals of freedom,  you won't prevail); let's hope it doesn't happen again!! We'd hate to see more anti-war photos (like the ones in Vietnam) decorating halls in Iraq someday claiming american's support for Jihad!!",1097539200,12,837,5.333333333333333
2128097,5,B0002W2JP0,"The more I learn about Kerry, the more respect I have for him. His life story is truly amazing. His whole life he has fought for the people. He could have easily avoided Vietnam, he came from a wealthy family. But he said ""send me"". It's really sad we have abunch of liars funded by top Bush fundies trying to tarnish a freakin war hero's record. When the president himself didn't even serve. Where are Bush's brothers in arms? I haven't seen anyone come out and say ""I served with George W Bush"". Because that would be impossible, Dubya didn't serve. All Kerry's records have been released, they are all downloadable at his website, the Navy has come out and confirmed them and said he earned his medals. So get over it, Kerry's a war hero. And about his testimony in front in 71'. He didn't betray anyone, he came back and found out a lot of veterans weren't getting the help they needed from the government, so he fought for veteran rights and fought to end the quaqmire in Vietnam which was really unwinnable. We are at war, Id like to have a man who has seen war first hand running my country. Funny how people say Kerry would be soft on terroism. When he's been fighting it his whole life. Rather it be on the front lines in vietnam, fighting for rape victims rights as a prosecutor or exposing the BCCI and Iran Contra scandal as a senator. Bet you Bush followers never heard of that have you? Do some research, you'll be surprised. This guy is a fighter, his father didn't carry him under his wing his whole life. He took the harder path in life even though he could have taken the easy way out numerous times. Thats the kind of person I want leading my country. I want to be able to say ""hey, thats my president"" and smile and feel good about it again. Send John Kerry.",1095897600,51,1778,4.342342342342342
2128098,5,B0002W2JP0,"This video will bring to light the lies told in a recent book about Kerry by the so called ""swift boat veterans for truth"". The only reason he brings up the past is because bush has supported people to slam Kerry's past, and he is only defending himself from the lies. Lies that have already been proven as such. He would talk about the issues, but the so called conservatives say things like 'flip flop' and what not to keep him talking about things they want him to talk(defend himself) about. By the way, who really flip flopped? Kerry voted to support our troops with all the necessary weapons first, but bush voted against it so he could get tax breaks for the rich! (THINK ABOUT IT!) bush just wants you to ignore how big a hole he has dug our country in the past 4 years by making stuff up about Kerry and keeping you focused on him. I know what bush's record is and his record REALLY SUCKS! No child left behind, but then he doesn't fund it, healthcare reform but then he pushes bills through that favor insurance and pharmacy companies and leave millions WITH OUT healthcare. The clear skies initiative, and polution is worse than it was 4 years ago. THE BIGGEST debt in our nations history after being handed the largest surplus in our nations history. Giving tax breaks to companies to send jobs overseas, what about making jobs here in our country?!?!?! He let haliburton get how many no-bid contracts after going to war with a country that NOTHING to do with 9/11... and doesn't even require them to account for the millions of dollars that are un-accounted for... and what ever happened to Osama?!?!?!?! How about bush and ken lay, all of a sudden bush doesn't know the guy after he used his personal jet to do his 2000 campaign tour... Don't tell me about who's history is better, bush couldn't even run a major league baseball team without running it into the ground, what makes you think he can actually do good for our country? I would be glad to have Kerry elected into the presidency (unlike bush was). bush is a punk! just check out this cheap shot and you will see what kind of punk he really is!

[...]

Just proves he has ALWAYS taken cheap shots at his opponents, and now is no different. That's just my opinion, I know. But I know I am not alone in it. WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!!!!

2128127,1,B0002W2JP0,"This would be more believable if it were factual. John Kerry picked Swifts Boats because at the time he choose they were limited to off shore duty. The Actual Time Line shows that Kerry spent no more than 8 weeks in a hostile fire zone and was the only member of his crew to be awarded a Purple Heart. In those 8 weeks he managed to put himself in for 3 Purple Hearts the magic number that ended your combat tour and got you sent home early. John Kerry's C.O. was unaware of even a single P.H. Award. If fact he threw Kerry out of his tent for attempting to claim a self inflected wound as grounds for a Purple Heart. Kerry, and Officer has found a gullible company clerk who'd write up and submit undeserved medals for valor for him...quid pro quo.

With the exception of one other Swift Boat Captain John Kerry was hated by all the other Swift Boat Officers. His own twin 50 cal. bow gunner refused to join the ""dog & pony show"" that his shipmates engaged in to falsely spew ""glowing acts of bravery and leadership"" during the Campaign for President. This gunner called Captain Kerry a lair and a coward who'd always turn the boat around to avoid a fight.

This is the gunner that shot the VC teenager that pointed the B-24 Rocket at their boat. The enemy teenager was mortally wounded by numerous hits from the 50's 1/2"" bullets. Kerry gave the illegal order to ""beach the boat"", whereby he ran over to the dying young enemy and executed him with a single shot to the back,and took his B-240 as a War Trophy. Later he had his friendly company clerk put him in for a SILVER STAR for heroism. Another award his C.O. knew nothing about.

John Kerry's cowardice and affinity for undeserved medals was only overshadowed by his quest for power at any price...including TREASON.

While still a US Naval Officer John Kerry met secretly with Viet Cong representatives in Paris. They helped him organize his anti-war demonstrations and supplied him with the Viet Cong flags to fly in support of the enemy. His powerful but totally false and treasonous testimony to Congress was worthy of an Oscar, and lengthy jail term.. John Kerry's testimony can be seen on YouTube where by from his Swift Boat he says he witnessed American Ground Troops Rape, Murders, Burn Villages, and pillage ""not seen since the days of Genghis Khan"".

I spent over 500 days in combat in Vietnam, I never witnessed anything remotely resembling Kerry's visions. RAPE ? why risk 10 years in prison when you could buy sex for a pack of C-rations ? Yes, when we found a ""large"" weapons cache  in a Village, we burned the Village.

My first tour I was a Cavalry Scout, the horrific war crimes I witnessed the VC doing against their own defenseless people was beyond imagination...young girls rapes by over 100 Viet Cong troops, young men taken from their families and forced to fight for the Communists or their Village Elder's wife was tortured to death in front of him.

One specific even still haunts me. We relocated a small village of Hamungs Vietnamese Mountain People. They were not the ""steal the watch off your wrist city people""...they were ancient people, high values, morals and traditions. They knew we wanted to help them, that we had to relocated them for a while as we cleared out their peaceful valley of the murderous Viet Cong. They would be in danger from both sides. We liked them, we respected them, and THEY WERE THE REASON we were in Vietnam.

We took them to a government prepared Village nearby our small base camp. We checked on them every night as went out to set up Ambushes for the V.C. One morning at around 3:00am a small Hamung boy ran up to our front gate screaming ""the VC are in our village"". We had a ready reactionary force prepared for this...and were mounted on our M-113 Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicles and out the gate within 3-4 minutes. The trip to their village took and agonizingly long 5-8 minutes to reach their village in the dark. The Viet Cong had heard us coming as we called for 155 howtzer flares to light up the way ahead of us.

By the time we got there it was all over. The V.C had sneaked in and surprised them.  One V.C with an AK held each family inside their little one room one door hootch at gun point until the man with the flame-thrower could get to them. Once there he ""fried each family, consisting of elderly parents a mother and 1-3 small children, no military age males. They killed these innocent villagers simply for accepting help from the Americans. But they Burned them to Death, just to make a point. A bullet in the head would have been more humane, but HUMANE wasn't the message they required. What had begun as a soldier just doing his job, putting in his 365 and then going home and leaving this hell hole forever.

That night changed everything.  30 days before I was to rotate home I volunteered to be a Helicopter Gun Ship Door Gunner in my units Air Cavalry Section.  Those Gun Ships had saved our platoon more times than I could count when my lifespan was reduced to being measured in ""minutes"". They always came to the rescue, and when they left, they left behind enemy dead bodies scattered everywhere. It was said the ""average Gun Ship Door Gunner"" if he survives his 6 month tour, will leave Vietnam with over 200 confirmed enemy kills.

I had no intention to be even close to ""average"".... As luck would have it a door gunner was wounded and a slot opened up right when I needed it. It was on the ""frog ship"" a rare Gun Ship with what looked like a basket ball stuck to the nose. That was the housing for the high explosive 40mm automatic nose canon. A devastating weapon, we also had our Door Guns (M-60 Machine Guns) souped up from 550 rounds per minute to fire over 1200 rounds per minutes. Barrel overheating was not a problem due to Air Speed and Rotor Wash...on the ground a normal M-60 is fired at 8-10 round bursts. In the Air we fired 1000+ round bursts. IT WAS PAYBACK TIME FOR THOSE INNOCENT VILLAGERS.

John Kerry also has a TRIBUTE to him in the Communist War Museum in what was formerly Saigon. Its a monument plaque that reads ""John Kerry for his contributions in helping the Vietnamese Peoples Army defeat the American Imperialist Invasion of Vietnam. An enemy TRIBUTE to an American Traitor, for his work in assisting Jane Fonda in helping the Communists win their overthrow of the government in South Vietnam.

John Kerry has earned the title of TRAITOR. His slanderous testimony to Congress of the American War Crimes he personally witnessed from the ""armored bridge of his Swift Boat"". Indecently, out of his 5 man boat crew, commanding from the Armored Bridge of the Swift Boat Lt. Kerry was supposedly wounded by enemy fired 3 times, the only man to ever be wounded on his boat. In addition, during the 8 weeks he actually spent in a hostile fire zone...John Kerry somehow managed without the knowledge or consent of his Commanding Officer receive a Silver Star (for shooting a dying VC teenager in the back) A Bronze Star w/V for Valor, and 3 Purple Hearts for wounds that no one else knew anything about..

The former US Army Ground Troops that gave supporting testimony to John Kerry's testimony that he personally witnessed American Soldiers, ie. Infantry Ground Troops commit grievous War Crimes against the Vietnamese Villagers....all from the safety of his Armored Bridge in the middle of the River. A minimum distance of at least 1000 years of which he had to peer through dense Jungle to witness.

After the terribly destructive testimony that boosted enemy moral, as it came on top of Jane Fonda's broadcasts direct from Communist Hanoi Vietnam on Hanoi Hanna's Radio station that played all the current hits for the GI's in the Field. Her broadcasts..."" pleaded with the American Troops to MUTINY against their Officers, join the Communist Peoples Army in freeing Vietnam from American Imperialist Aggression... ""

The American troops just laughed and enjoyed the Music. Back home those supposedly former Ground Troops who's testimony supported John Kerry's statements of War Crimes, as they admitted to committing those same crimes repeatedly themselves while their Officers just looked the other way. An honest Investigative Reporter, a very rare bird in those days looked into the Military Records of those men who testified for Kerry in his slander of all US Troops fighting in Vietnam....The Reporter found that NOT ONE of those who testified was ever in the MILITARY. They were all Students paid by Kerry for a scripted testimony of lies and deceit against the REAL AMERICANS fighting for the Vietnamese People.

note: In his Bio General Giap the leader of all Communist Forces in Vietnam said that after TET 1968 the American Marines had so badly mauled or killed his NVA Forces fighting in the North, and that the US Army Ground Troops and Helicopters had so totally annihilated his Viet Cong Forces fighting in the South ...that they ceased to be a viable fighting unit for the remainder of the War. General Giap admitted at that juncture all hope for Victory seems lost. He was going to request a Conditional Surrender and end the War while he still had an army to defend his Northern Homeland.

General Giap admits that Walter Cronkite (later upon retiring came clean and admitted he was a Socialist and his nightly Media Views and Reports on the American progress of the Vietnam War were slanted and reflected his ideology not necessarily the truth) and anti-war activists like Jane Fonda, and John Kerry persuaded him to ""stay in the fight"" that the American Peoples resolve would weaken, and they would demand their troops be brought home.

This Treasonous Act of encouraging the enemy to stay in the fight, and for a highly respected but secretly ""Socialist Reporter"" to spread stories of ""defeat and snatch loss from the jaws of Victory""...was not just acts of TREASON by the John Kerry, Jane Fonda crowd.

According to the CIC General of all Communist Forces in Vietnam the, TET OFFENSIVE of 1968 was not an ENEMY VICTORY as Walter Cronkite reported on the 6:00 pm News. I fought  in the TET OFFENSIVE from a Huey Helicopter Gunship. I can tell you first hand, without a shred of embellishment ....we slaughtered those bastards by the trainloads.

One night we got word from the perimeter guards on the Long Bien POW camp...they smelled POT in the air coming from the Jungle, a LOT OF POT. The VC often smoked their fears away before a full scale attack. From the Jungle to the Perimeter Wire and Machine Gun Bunkers and defensive sand bags walls and berms...was about 250 years. with a row of rolled Constantina Wire in the middle to help slow a big human wave attack down a little.

We circled at 3500' about a mile away, running lights out. We already alerted a 155 Howitzer Battery to stand by. They had the coordinates and we told them to fire two 30 second, flares to open at 1500' twenty seconds apart and keep them coming until we say... STOP.
Then they attacked. Me being 21 years old, and always stuck on 100% revenge mode and full adrenaline addiction....I wanted to get into the fight. The pilots just waited, it was an eternity for me. Then the first wave hit the rolled Constantina Wire, it stopped them and the 2nd wave slammed into them in the confusion...Then the pilot flipped on the lights and we began our Assault Dive. We hit the rectangle perimeter far end and leveled at 20 feet off the ground. Then I felt the Rocket Tubes shudder under my boot, and the huge tin box next to me, began to rattle loudly. It was the magazine for the 40mm nose canon. 350 rounds of HE (high explosive) equal to a hand grenade and more firing from side to side. The Rockets were equal to a 105 howitzer round and we had 14 of them.

Then we opened up with our souped up M-60's the scalpels and we were the surgeons. We were pulling back the trigger's and just holding them back. On the floor between my legs was a large wood box with high sides. It held around 3500-4500+ / 308 cal. rounds. The enemy was dropping like flies...I stopped counting at 40ish as the pilots would never bother to confirm even a single kill for us that night...My Crew Chief and I probably took out at a minimum 100-150 enemy each. The Bunker Guards would get all the credit, we'd get a litter ""assisted by Huey Gun Ships"" somewhere at the end....like we showed up after the Bunker Guards had already killed most of them...

We didn't care....we knew there was a whole lot of Viet Cong down there about to be bulldozed into a shallow grave, never to bring tears to another human being ever again. That was our mission, eliminate the ""heart breakers"" and send those sick POS to hell.

In my 500 days in combat I never came across a single man that met the description in John Kerry's slanderous testimony to Congress. John Kerry was playing politics for his own personal enrichment with the lives of American troops.

HERE IS THE FACTS...AFTER TET 1968 GENERAL GIAP WANTED TO SURRENDER. HE WAS TALKED OUT OF A CONDITIONAL SURRENDER WHICH WOULD HAVE ENDED THE WAR IMMEDIATELY, ON OUR TERMS. THIS WAS 1968.

THE WAR ENDED FOR AMERICANS IN 1972. THAT'S WHEN PRESIDENT NIXON ASSURED HIS RE ELECTION BY GIVING IN TO ALL OF THE COMMUNIST DEMANDS INCLUDING CUTTING OFF ALL AID TO SOUTH VIETNAM DOWN TO A SINGLE BULLET AND GALLON OF FUEL. THIS SELL OUT AND BETRAYAL WAS CALLED THE CHRUCH-CHASE ACT. IT WAS THE KNIFE IN THE BACK OF OUR LONGEST ALLY. MOST IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS THAT THIS WAR COULD HAVE ENDED IN 1968.

FROM 1968 TO 1972.... 15,000 ADDITIONAL AMERICAN LIVES WERE LOST IN BATTLE.... ""KILLED IN ACTION"".  THESE MEN DIED BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE JANE FONDA AND JOHN KERRY WANTED THEIR SIDE TO WIN, NO MATTER HOW MANY AMERICAN LIVES IT TOOK TO ACCOMPLISH. BOTH KERRY AND FONDA TOOK CREDIT FOR BRINGING THE VIETNAM WAR TO AN END FOR AMERICA IN 1972. AFTER TET 1968 THE ENEMY WAS NEVER THE SAME. THE MARINES SLAUGHTERED THEM AT HUE. KAHN SAN COST

THE WAR FOR THE VIETNAMESE LASTED UNTIL 1975. IT ENDED IN THE LAST BATTLE FOUGHT IN MY FORMER BASE CAMP, THE BLACKHORSE BASE CAMP. THERE, 4000 ARVN RANGERS MADE A LAST STAND AGAINST 40,000 COMMUNIST NVA TROOPS WITH TANKS. THEY WIPED OUT 2 DIVISIONS THOSE WERE RE ENFORCED WITH 3 MORE, THE RANGERS SIMPLY RAN OUT OF AMMO, THEN WENT HAND TO HAND ...THEY WERE ALL KILLED.

BECAUSE JOHN KERRY NEEDED A POLITICAL WIN, TO THE WAR. NIXON WANTED REELECTION NO MATTER HOW MANY HAD TO DIE TO SECURE THAT WIN .... THEN HE WAS REMOVED FROM OFFICE AND WITH HIM THE THREAT OF B-52'S RAINING DEATH DOWN UPON NORTH VIETNAM AS PUNISHMENT IF THE COMMUNISTS BROKE THEIR AGREEMENT.

THEY PULLED BACK ACROSS THE CAMBODIAN BORDER TO R&R IN THEIR SANCTUARIES AND JUST ""WAIT"". THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT LONG. NIXON RESIGNED, PRESIDENT FORD WAS A TIMID MAN, A MAN MUCH LIKE OBAMA, UNABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND LITTLE MORE THAT AN A CONTROLLED PUPPET.

THE COMMUNISTS BROKE THEIR AGREEMENTS AND ATTACKED THE SOUTH. WITH BOTH RUSSIA & CHINA SUPPLYING WEAPONS, ARMS, ARMOR, TANKS AND ...FUEL. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE, LIKE THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ, NEVER HAD A CHANCE. UP TO 1.5 MILLION DIED IN THE GREAT COMMUNIST PURGE.

FOR THE CORE OF ALL THIS WE MUST GO BACK TO THE DAY ONE UNKNOWN, COWARDLY, LYING TRAITOR, PAID A BUNCH OF EQUALLY TREASONOUS AMERICAN STUDENTS... TO PRETEND THEY WERE FORMER US SOLDIERS IN VIETNAM AND ADMITTEDLY COMMITTED THE WAR CRIMES THAT JOHN KERRY SAW WITH HIS OWN EYES...AT OVER 1000 YARDS, THRU HEAVY JUNGLE FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER.... HE LIED TO ADVANCE HIS POLITICAL CAREER. EVERYTHING ABOUT JOHN KERRY IS A LIE.

TODAY HE IS STRUGGLING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH IRAN ON THEIR MANUFACTURING OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. ITS THE KEY TO THEIR POSITION IN THE WORLD AS A POWER TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. SEC.OF STATE JOHN KERRY NEEDS TO SECURE HIS PLACE IN HISTORY AND HIS EGO....BY PROMISING THEM, AS NIXON DID THE NORTH VIETNAMESE COMMUNISTS ....WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE A DEAL, ""FOR A WIN TODAY"", EVEN THOSE THOUSANDS MAY DIE AS A RESULT TOMORROW.

SEC. OF STATE JOHN KERRY IS A TRAITOR.

GO TO YOUTUBE AND WATCH IS TREASONOUS TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS. THE FBI HAS A FILE ON JOHN KERRY TOO, THEY KNEW HE WAS MEETING WITH THE ENEMY IN PARIS WHILE STILL A US NAVAL OFFICER. THE FBI KNEW JOHN KERRY WAS A TRAITOR....AND THEY WATCHED HIS EVERY MOVE.

LOOK AT HIS PAST, LISTEN TO THE LIES HE TOLD ABOUT MEN THAT JOHN KERRY WAS NOT FIT TO LICK THEIR BOOTS.

THE TRUTH IS ABUNDANT, AND THE TRUTH IS AVAILABLE. WHY ELSE WOULD SOMEONE LIKE OBAMA PICK JOHN KERRY ?",1435622400,7,16460,4.595432856169053

8033552,1,B0002W2JP0,John Kerry is a walking disgrace. The only man in the history of the Vietnam  to get 3 purple hearts in the four months that he served in Vietnam (Which he wrote up himself) and never spent more than a short time in the dispensary) He was considered a loose cannon and his boat was kept away from most of the other boats that really were doing the fighting. His picture is in the Hanoi war museum as a hero of the revolution. He should have been court martialed.
