8165014,2,B000LXGVOK,"Jackie Shroff only cameos in this movie, basically; extended special appearance it seems. That's okay.

What's not okay is that the main actors in this movie are more or less second raters, and no amount of plot twists and turns seem to make it more interesting.

It seems that Shroff, Kader Khan and Monish Behl have thrown their lot in to support, but given the bar of Bollywood acting at the time had been set so high (at that time, not now) you tend to notice Manek Bedi, Ayub Khan and the double-role playing Mamta Kilkarni have lesser acting skills, although they seem to get better during the movie.

It's not a horrible movie, I'd rate it five our of ten.",1376870400,,663,4.462809917355372
