7599364,5,B01AEOM79I,"Grace and Frankie is a very fresh twist on the old divorcee theme.  It is quite hilarious, but quite touching at times.  These characters are real, flawed, and brutally honest.  The writing is top notch and the acting is Oscar worthy!  But then, what would you expect from an all-star team consisting of Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Martin Sheen, and Sam Waterston.  This is one that should be put on your don't miss list.",1459900800,59,418,4.594594594594595

7599367,4,B01AEOM79I,"This is a heart warming story of a developing friendship between two women ,who never liked each other, thrown together by divorces. They learn to support each other and accept each others strengths and quirks. The husbands are in the show too much...not because they are gay...but because their story line sounded like two old women flighting over stupid details instead of two adult men. The four adult children are funny and realistic in their struggle to deal with the changes to the family dynamics.
We can learn a lot from the story of twi women building each other up instead of .tearing each other down.",1455840000,14,611,4.773584905660377
7599368,4,B01AEOM79I,"Grace is a polished, sophisticated WASP who formerly ran a cosmetics company. Frankie is a socially-conscious hippie who teaches ex-cons to paint. These two women have absolutely nothing in common...

... until their husbands declare that they are leaving their wives in order to marry each other. Yes indeed, ""Grace and Frankie Season 1"" is the old tale of faithful wives dumped for someone else.... but in this case, it's further complicated by a bisexual twist. And while this clever little comedy has a few bumps in the road, it also has a staggeringly talented cast and a mixture of irreverent wit (""Have you ever wondered if Ben and Jerry make more than ice cream together?"") and bittersweet family drama.

During a group lunch, Grace (Jane Fonda) and Frankie (Lily Tomlin) are flabbergasted when their husbands Robert (Martin Sheen) and Sol (Sam Waterston) reveal that they are divorcing their wives. Apparently the men have been having a clandestine affair for the past twenty years, and now they want to get married. Needless to say, both the women are devastated, and their kids (who take after their parents in various ways, and have their own array of issues) are shocked.

Grace moves into the former couples' jointly-owned beachside house in order to get away from the world and her soon-to-be-ex-husband, only to find that Frankie is also crashing there. While the women initially get on like matches and dynamite, their shared loss and grief (plus a nightlong peyote trip on the beach) prompts them to try being roommates at the beach house. But not only do they have to deal with their grief and anger, but the daunting task of reinventing their whole lives as septuagenarians -- learning how to date in the 21st century, trying to get jobs, and occasionally dancing on bars.

Meanwhile, Robert and Sol are trying to get used to THEIR new life as an open same-sex couple, which is somewhat complicated by Sol's continuing closeness to Frankie, and their struggles to plan their forthcoming wedding. And their kids aren't quite sure how to handle this situation -- after all, if their fathers had been cheating with women, there would be (""no cake!"") no celebrations of their relationship.

In some ways, ""Grace and Frankie"" hits on a lot of familiar notes for a comedy -- the woes of dating, life after divorce, odd-couple conflicts, family strife, etc. But it takes a different tack from the usual. The women in question are in their seventies, have been married for four decades (and expected to be so until they died), and they're only divorced because their husbands turned out to be having an affair. Yep, this is a bit different from the usual dreck churned out by the networks.

... and yet not only does ""Grace and Frankie"" handle these very touchy, tough subjects, but it manages to be both funny and poignant without losing its grip on either emotion. It knows how to make you root for these characters even as you giggle at Frankie's inability to turn her new Mac on.

A lot of the credit for this goes to the cast -- Fonda, Sheen, Tomlin and Waterston are all phenomenal actors who bring a lot of charm, energy and complexity to their characters. Though all of them seem like fairly stock characters (uptight yuppie, aging hippie, closeted prissy lawyer), they all struggle with every step they make and every new experience. Perhaps the biggest problem is... well, Sheen and Waterston don't have an ounce of sexual chemistry, but Tomlin's pleasantly flaky hippie and Fonda's beautiful yet brittle matriarch make up for that.

But don't let that description keep them from sounding absolutely hilarious -- all of them have unique comic timing, from the dry (Sheen) to the adorably frenetic (""My joints are SUPPLE!""), and it's always fun to see the two ladies romping around through the town in each other's clothes, stealing cigarettes and going to bars. Even some of the subplots are gutsplittijngly funny (Brianna adopting a dog and trying to peddle organic lube), although a few (Coyote trying to find his birth mother) don't really seem to go anywhere.

But the funniest aspect is the writing, which tends to be snappy and clever (""Anyone who can do this is a powerful witch."" ""Well, I can do it."" ""I rest my case""). There's a lot of wacky situations (the most awkward sex scene outside of ""Twilight"") and embarrassment, but the series never quite descends into slapstickiness... except for the scene with the pink rodeo penis. That was kind of silly.

One thing that was a bit perplexing was the bisexual erasure. While Robert is hinted to be wholly gay and has few regrets, Sol is pretty clearly indicated to be bisexual.... and yet everyone refers to the two men as homosexual, including themselves. Perhaps it's an age thing (since bisexuality is less acknowledged in the older generations), but it's a bit perplexing.

""Grace and Frankie Season 1"" is not only a delightfully funny series (""Does he smell like a cat?""), but a poignant tale of older women having to reinvent their lives when things don't turn out as they expected. Fun, weird and a little sad.",1454803200,42,5096,4.839265212399541

7599395,5,B01AEOM79I,"The series is about two elderly, heterosexual couples that have each been married about 40 years. The two men ( Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen) meet their wives ( Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda ) at a restaurant in their home city of San Diego CA and confess to their wives that they've been having a sexual relationship with each other for the past 20 years and that they want to divorce their wives and marry each other. From there we get to watch their lives, post confession, unfold. There's all the dysfunction that plagues all families and it's a hell of a lot of fun to watch. Although the four central characters are over 70 years of age, there are subplots that involve their young-adult aged kids. This series has a lot of top-notch actors that viewers of all ages can relate to and is classy, down-to-earth, intricate and enlightening. I bought season one , on a whim, after browsing the web. Of course I like both Tomlin and Fonda as actors and that's why I gave this series a chance. My husband and I sat down to watch the pilot episode and laughed repeatedly throughout the hour long episode. We immediately fell in love with this show and just had to watch one more episode and afterwards decided then and there to watch just one episode a week or else we'd binge watch and quickly run right through season one. From that day on Fridays are now officially referred to as "" Grace and Frankie "" Fridays. We both LOVE and HIGHLY recommend this series.",1520726400,2,1459,4.468164794007491

And much as I loved Jane's workout videos from thirty years ago, she still cannot act.  Lily has been great in some things, but playing an old hippie doesn't work in this show.  Those of us who really were hippies are now feeling a backlash.  The men are adequate actors but their characters are not believable.  The stories are vapid and there is no way anyone my age is going to relate to them.  This is easily the worst drivel I've seen in years.  If you're ""older"" and expecting to relate to this show, forget it.  And if you expect to get a laugh, you won't.  This is just awful.",1514678400,10,750,4.145833333333333

The audience thus far can follow the hows for most of the whys everyone is as he or she becomes, are becoming. One exception is Coyote the addiction. He just is and is, now, recovered. Addiction is rooted in toxic shame. Addicts have no boundaries so don't have healthy shame. Shame is about secrecy. The 'hunter' is coming' kind of thing. A family is as sick as its secrets. So... what's Coyote's 'reason' for his addiction? I'm certain I'm not the only one who sees this character as having great potential but is being 'displayed' unfairly for any audience members who've come through recovery. Also, don't get too OTT with Frankie as in S3 she's starting to get on nerves I didn't know I had anymore. Why's she becoming bully-ish? In your face-ish? She was super laid back in S1/S2. And, lastly, cool it with the gaze filtering, lighting, whatever, with their faces. S1/S2 we saw realness. And now in S3 they (all of them) look younger? Details matter.",1506384000,,1085,4.65625

This shows a very healthy way of getting over the heartbreak of divorce, at least on Grace and Robert's part. I adore Brianna, the fact that she says what's on her mind is hilarious! That's where the good parts end. I despise Frankie. Not only do I not have any friends like her but I have never met anyone as off the wall as her. She's so dysfunctional, and the endless back and forth between her and Sol is just bizarre. They are codependent with a capital C. Martin and Sam are an adorable couple and good for them for taking on these complex roles. I just wanted them to be together and live happily ever after, but yet again Frankie got in the middle. Other than occasional comic relief and one liners, which is all that Frankie is good for, I think she should be written off of the show. She does nothing for it and it would be much better without her. This is hard to say because I think Lily Tomlin is an amazing actress.",1493337600,,1037,4.19

Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are just excellent, as is the supporting cast.
Each episode brings something new to the table.
Last bu not least, it's a great break from the heavier shows I'm usually attracted to, like those dark Scandinavian mysteries and the BBC dramas.",1491696000,,525,4.536842105263158

7599486,3,B01AEOM79I,"I wanted to like this series, and on the positive side, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin's comedic abilities are wonderful, and the travails of aging are treated with sympathy, cleverness and good humor.  But too many negatives drag the show down.  Usually I like the actors Martin Sheen and Sam Waterson, but they are totally unconvincing as a gay couple, the two sons are forgettable and the daughters are utterly charmless......worse than charmless, they're mean, shallow, smug and obnoxious.  Anytime Fonda and Tomlin leave the screen, the show heads towards insufferable.  The dialogue is witty at times, but suffers from shallow cliches and unnecessary vulgarity.  (Obscenities just seem a lazy attempt at edginess.)  Overall, the characters (and apparently the writers) seem unaware of the elitism portrayed, as whining from 1%-ers and their spoiled offspring may be less than lovable.  Altogether leading me to wonder.......are Californians REALLY this obnoxious?  I've kept watching because I love Lily Tomlin's wardrobe and want to see what she'll be wearing next.  But that is probably not enough to keep me going.

btw.....if you're looking for a TV series that's funnier, more uplifting and less elitist, I'd recommend ""Parks and Recreation.""",1490486400,,1249,5.358974358974359

If you are 70 years old and NOT taking loads of hormones, HOW MUCH sex drive do you really have? Why can't people be friends?Deep friendship is so EXCITING. Also, the latest season (3) has digs to conservatives, southerners, and Christians and really promotes the idea that if you are a ""moral person"" you'll help others do immoral things, if you ""love"" them. So, I'm dropping out. Oh well, more time to read. Oh, and I fast forward through most of the homosexual stuff, not my thing.",1490400000,,621,4.456140350877193

I didn't even realize it was only a half an hour show because each episode is so tightly written-there's so much happening in it it feels like an hour (of course when you think about the fact that ""an hour"" TV show is now only 42 min. long and a situation comedy on DVD without the commercials runs a little bit longer I timed it out at approximately 25 min. I guess there's almost not that much difference between a half-hour show and an hour show Anyway this show is absolutely hysterical Yet the humor is based on ""real life situations"" I guess you could say-just my type humor. I adore this show and I've only seen the first DVD disc which I'm actually really watching because I want to catch every little nuance of facial expressions and situations. I can only hope that Netflix will offer a season two on DVD because I don't do any streaming or subscribing. Anyway I'm enjoying this show tremendously and laughing right out loud!  :-D I should say that the show is not for everybody in that it's probably rated R with language situations but entirely appropriate for our odd couple of Frankie and Grace played by Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin.",1484438400,2,1269,4.4

Thankful Season 3 is ago and I would start a campaign to ensure at least 5 more seasons...at least!!!",1474588800,2,391,4.953846153846154
7599588,5,B01AEOM79I,"My first thought is NETFLIX is on the roll here with some great original programming for all ages. GRACE AND FRANKIE is pure joy. The chemistry between Jane Fonda (Grace) and Lily Tomlin totally lights up the screen. Both actors are in their 70's and full of life and vibrance. They prove that you're only as old as you feel.

The series does start slowly and I was afraid I would lose interest but then it moved full steam ahead. There is no lead up to the main event. We know from the beginning that Grace's husband Robert (Martin Sheen) is leaving her to marry Frankie's husband Sol (a very delightful Sam Waterston). The lack of any backstory or lead up seemed annoying and confusing at first but in later episodes we get more of the story.

There is a double story here worth thinking about.  Two men have been living a lie and finally come out as gay in their 70's. On the other side, we have two women faced with knowing they have unknowingly been part of this lie and now are single and have to over in their 70's. Yes, Grace and Frankie do it with grace and frankness. We feel their struggles. Neither women have been fond of each other through the years but now they must bond and grow together.

Fonda and Tomlin seem to play exaggerated versions of their real selves and it works. Fonda is the beautiful but rigid socialite author. Tomlin is the quirky yet seriously lovable earth mother. Sheen seems a bit stilted as a gay man but someone the wonderful Sam Waterson brings in all the joys and sadness of his new life. Waterston is a gem. I have always liked him and thought of him as a dramatic actor but here he is in a new role--serious, sweet, loving, full of guilt and totally delightful. There is a crinkle and spark in his eyes when he smiles. He's the grandfather we all wish we had in life.

This show really delves into the lives of two women whose husbands come out as gay. GRACE AND FRANKIE doesn't portray these 70 plus ladies as anything but young-hearted and vibrant. Their age is not used as brunt of jokes as in many other shows. They are sexy and alive.

The only annoying part of GRACE AND FRANKIE are their 4 kids. The characters and the actors seem out of place and rather unpleasant.
I first thought Frankie and Sol's sons (one black and one white) were a gay couple. Nwabudike (Baron Vaughn) is the most likable of the three but his character is the least developed. Coyote (Ethan Embry) is a reformed alcoholic and drug addict yet he taunted by soon to be sisters for his past while they rush off to have a drink to deal with their gay fathers. Briana (June Diane Raphael) is by far the most obnoxious and annoying daughter on TV. Crude, sex crazed, lonely, sad and a great businesswoman. We just don't need to see these characters.

Another bit of fun is seeing popular and now senior actors again--Ernie, Hudson, Craig T. Nelson, and Corbin Bernsen with more to come in Season 2. It's a show about life and living it to the fullest. Finally, there is a show about seniors who are enjoying life and not dying or incapacitated. This show is fun for people of all ages. Plenty and maybe excessive crude language but mostly everything is in good taste. Fonda and Tomlin are real winners here.",1474416000,21,3226,4.420875420875421
7599595,5,B01AEOM79I,This show is one of the reasons I have Netflix. I got the DVD for my mom and she's been loaning it to her friends. Lily Tomlin is the best!,1474416000,,139,3.6666666666666665
7599596,5,B01AEOM79I,"Lily Thomlin and Jane Fonda knock it out of the park as foils and friends in this half hour sitcom. Their co-stars Martin Sheen and Sam Waterson really rise to the occasion with their performances, and the actors playing their children each bring something to the overall fun. I suggest you watch Season 1 Episode 1 and see what you think. I think it is a HULU series but I was able to play a little catch up by purchasing a few episodes from Amazon Prime.

7599642,5,B01AEOM79I,"What a cast!  This could easily have been a ""blah"" series, but each of the characters is so well acted that it's very entertaining.

A series with a serious premise:  Two men, who are partners in the same law firm, have secretly been having an affair for twenty years.  Once gay marriage was legal in their state, they decided to leave their wives and marry.  This plot, which could easily be a serious drama is treated with a light hand, so that even though it's a respectful treatment of the subject, it's a quite funny series.  Please watch two or three episodes to make up your mind about the series -- the first two episodes have a lot of back story and  character development to convey, so they aren't quite as entertaining as the later episodes.",1471219200,6,752,4.485294117647059
7599643,4,B01AEOM79I,"The writing on this show is the best I've seen/heard in a very long time. The dialogue is so dry...so witty...so, so many fabulous one liners. I am so freaking in love with Frankie's character - but she is me in about 30 years, so I am probably biased. :)

This show is not for the faint of heart. The language, topics, and storylines are in your face (which I love, but more conservative people might not). This is not a cutesy sitcom...it's a blunt, razor sharp, and unapologetic. I love it.",1471046400,,493,4.358695652173913

She kept stealing the show I had to look her up to find out who she was as I had never heard of her.  This was a fantastic show.  I thought I would watch one episode and move on, but it hooked me in I ended up watching this whole season.  I would watch it again.

Oh yes there are bits and pieces here and there that do not resonate - they have tons of money (unlike most divorced women), a beach house that is fabulous (who can afford to live on the beach?), Jane Fonda is super slim and has NO wrinkles.  Given all of that, the acting is lovely, strong cast, beautifully photographed, and lots of the 'moments' seem very, very real.  When middle aged women divorce (been there and done that), how do they create a new life?  How do you date and/or have sex after 40 years with the same man?  The scene with Jane in bed with her first lover after 40 years is hilarious!

7599705,5,B01AEOM79I,"I absolutely adore this show and I am in my 30s.  It is sharply written and witty, smart and endearing, not to mention relateable and alive.  I love that it is about people in their 70s who aren't stuck in a senior community playing bingo and waiting to die.

I mean let's face it, in most movies or tv shows, old(er) people are treated as liabilities of some kind. They are either slow, or stupid and lame or foolish and forgetful. Generous to a fault, boring, without energy or goof-balls and loopy and silly. Maybe even grumpy and bitter. But they are never portrayed as real people who still have questions and doubts and who still, in many ways,  haven't figured it all out yet, despite being older. In most movies, no actually in ALL movies and shows, even when people their age are leads, they are still not fully realized and portrayed as human beings, but more like caricatures and archetypes.

Grace and Frankie has changed that and seeing that it is possible to make this show about two women instead of two senior citizens has been cathartic. For once, people in that age group are treated like the human beings they are instead of just being in everyone's way.  And their needs and desires are also treated as valid instead of as foolish and out of place. it is so refreshing to see a positive and realistic portrayal of women in their golden years. I love that they are not being portrayed as ""grandmas"" with silly grandma ""problems"" or used as punchlines to move the story of the younger characters along; younger characters whose lives and decisions are always shown as more important than that of the older family members whom society, especially in film, has decided already lived their lives and had no more learning, growing and overcoming to do.

Before seeing this I had never realized just how poorly and badly and stereotypical older people were being portrayed in Hollywood. I mean, of course intellectually I knew about the age discrimination and stories like Maggie Gyllenhaal's (a 36 year old who was told she was too old to play the younger girlfriend of an older man). But by seeing how amazing these people are portrayed, you realize just how poorly they are otherwise portrayed and just how much ageism is rampant in Hollywood.

But this show takes on an unconventional approach with heart, charm, wit and smarts and it has one of the most likable casts ever.",1468195200,,2391,4.66270783847981

Is that really what people enjoy watching? Because, frankly, I find it despicable and a trademark of poor production values. If you need to resort to bad language at every turn, you obviously don't have much of a story to keep things going.

7599753,5,B01AEOM79I,"Grace and Frankie is part comedy, part drama and all fun.

Season one starts off slow but give it a chance. The first episode was Meh, I wanted to stop watching but my wife insisted that we stick with it and after episode three we were both hooked.

The storyline is a new twist on your typical divorce story and is part comedy and part drama. Grace and Frankie will have you laughing one minute and crying the next.

The writing is honest and sincere and the characters real, genuine and brutally honest. Jane Fonda plays Grace, a former cosmetics executive in her seventies faced with starting over after 40 years of marriage. Lilly Tomlin plays Frankie, a free spirited social conscious hippie who has nothing in common with Grace. Along the journey we are joined by Grace and Frankie's all too real, dysfunctional family and their newly out of the closet gay ex-husbands.

The acting by the entire cast is brilliant throughout the show with exceptional performances by Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston.

Grace and Frankie is a fun, intelligent comedy that will leave you with a smile on your face and a tear in your eye.",1465171200,7,1147,4.658415841584159

7599761,1,B01AEOM79I,"I really hate to write a really negative review which involves four of my favorite actors and people. I'm a gay man in his sixties. Both my partner and I cringe at the behavior between Sol and Robert. They behave like teenage girls dealing with their first boyfriend. They are supposedly long time closeted lovers, yet behave in the most emotionally retarded way, especially Sol. He's an absolute air-head. Is this suppose to represent what we gays fought so long and hard for. No! Perhaps its just not our cup of tea or idea of entertainment. I was so looking forward to this because of the actors involved.

Jane and Lily are more interesting as a couple (I would much prefer their relationship to their ex-husbands). However, all they talk about is their drama, and Jane's need to show off her very beautiful body and face at age 70. She does look great, but all she can think about is a new boyfriend and getting f%$k#d. This bodily need and four letter words seem to be the  ceiling of their years of experience and maturity. They seem like stereotypes (as do their ex-husbands) with too much time and money. Is this what we as Americans work a lifetime toward, just being a soap opera character filled with endless drama and no substance or interesting conversation or purpose. Lost in our hormones and drama and lack of direction.

By chance I watched ""Woman in Gold,"" (BBC) right after ""Grace and Frankie."" In comparison, it pointed out how mature and dignified a woman (Helen Mirren) in her 70's could be, even while being but a seemingly average human being. By this standard Jane and Lily were flakes and represented woman, for me, in a rather pathetic and silly way (same with Sol and Robert). This is why Europeans laugh at us. Let's behave with some sophistication and class, not like silly stereotypes just out for a laugh at the expense of all that we are.

Let's engage people not simply entertain. Let's represent our species as something to strive for, not just two-dimensional characters going through the motions of living life and getting a laugh along the way. This show had great potential, but got lost along the way (or from the start). I like good acting, drama and entertainment, but not when people make themselves a joke for the sake of a laugh, especially when we're in our seventies. I've been with my partner for almost thirty years and have never found our relationship to be such a waste of one's deepest emotions and potential. The two great aspects of getting older are: great conversation and company. I don't find it here. Grace and Frankie, ditch the two ex-husbands and evolve into an interesting couple (friends, series) and give us something valuable to take away. Jane and Lily have what it takes, get new writers and a new director and move it into a new direction, a worthwhile production worth your time and our time!",1464825600,21,2864,4.676587301587301

I have caused a whole lot of people to become fans...some of the topics are controversial but make for good debate and conversation, challenges one to think outside the box; some of the scenes are still a bit uncomfortable...there's just something about Martin Sheen and Same Waterson kissing that makes me wrinkle my nose bc it's THEM and our brains have seen them in too many other roles prior to this...go figure. But I love the topics covered.",1532995200,,528,4.627659574468085
