7905937,5,B00000DGFC,"Despite the ""new guy"" awkwardness, most of this show is comedy gold! Host Dennis Miller was in rare form, and several of the featured comedians are hilarious, quotable, and memorable. My only beef is that this is not on DVD, because I definitely wore out my VHS tape ages ago! This is a home collection keeper!",1423699200,,310,4.553571428571429
7905938,5,B00000DGFC,"I first saw this on Comedy Central in 1997, and have seen it several more times since.  It is really funny.  I'm a huge Dennis Miller fan, so naturally I was happy to see him hosting this--check out the mullet!!!  David Spade was my favorite on this special, and I'm not much of a David Spade fan (though I also own his Best of SNL DVD).  I like when he does the ""Time Life Books"" joke--""Time Life Books presents...Mysteries!  A woman washing dishes gets a sharp pain in her hand, and at the same time, 100 miles away, her daughter is giving her boyfriend a H*** J**.""  You can't make this stuff up.  At the beginning and end of the video, the comedians and host all deliver some kind of commentary about how they will do on the show, and at the end, they reflect on how they did.  It ends with Miller singing...horribly.  You know, when he was put in an SNL sketch, you could always hear him singing if the sketch required actors to sing.  Great viewing, but don't expect to see too much Dennis Miller on here--it's 1989, and he was a fairly well-known and established comedian by this time (he was in his 4th season of SNL in early 1989).  Expect to see the other lesser-known comedians, but all in all, this is a GREAT special.  I highly recommend it!",1142899200,,1254,4.311965811965812
7905939,5,B00000DGFC,I love this video! I like all the comedians on it especially Dennis Miller. But the funniest comedian on it is David! His act was the funniest out of everyone else. When he talks about new print comercials and imitating Michael J. Fox and talking about Jeopardy! LOL! Very funny! You have to get this video if you can find it.,1088726400,,326,4.360655737704918
