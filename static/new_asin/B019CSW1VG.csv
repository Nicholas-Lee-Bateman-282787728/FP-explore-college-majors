8744686,5,B019CSW1VG,"Oh!  What a surprise.  I had never heard of this particular island but it is wonderful indeed with beautiful views of the Caribbean Sea.  I also notice that many of the sea views are toward the latter half of the video, but it always gives me a goal to work toward, every time I watch!",1473724800,,285,4.1454545454545455
8744687,3,B019CSW1VG,"Being that this is an island, I expect plenty of ocean views during this ride, however this is not the case.  Most of the first 40 minutes are riding along inland roads, with nothing interesting to look at (ocean views few and far between).  The latter part of the DVD is somewhat better in that you get more ocean views, but generally, I am disappointed with this location.",1455062400,,374,4.485294117647059
