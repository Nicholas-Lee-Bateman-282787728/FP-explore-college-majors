1251623,1,B0000296R7,If you are at home alone and there is absolutely and I mean absolutely nothing else to do then and only then watch this movie. I had to keep watching  it thinking over and over again this can only get better. Second  rate performances bad quality movie about nothing. Rated about as much fun  as watching paint dry.,960508800,2,315,4.396551724137931
1251624,2,B0000296R7,"Relationship trials and tribulations aside, this movie is just plain plodding and sluggish.  I wanted to like it, really I did. It is NOTHING like ""The Big Chill"" (which the ""box"" indicates)... it  has no real charm, no depth of history between these men, and no break from  the endless parade of gray moodiness. It fell short of even convincing me  any of these people loved each other (including the frienships).  Disappointing.",949708800,6,430,4.916666666666667

1251680,1,B0000296R7,"Trite attempt at film making. This ""idea"" of taking a weekend in the country with paired off friends has no drama, no humor and so-so production values. Perhaps the director, script writer and cast should have gone to see the play ""Love! Valour! Compassion!"" or even ""The Big Chill"" to see how this kind of situation should be dealt with.",1411689600,,338,4.65
1251681,1,B0000296R7,"This is just a slow, contrived, poorly acted high school film project.  I was able to watch for 18 minutes before I couldn't take it any more and had to start jumping ahead.  I finally gave up at 35 minutes.",1405036800,,207,4.15

1251703,4,B0000296R7,"I guess I expected fluff, and instead I found in this film a serious look at gay relationships.  It's not a comedy, as the cover picture might suggest, though it has its lighthearted moments.  The script and acting were convincing (though, for an American viewer, very British!), and the characters were interesting.  Unfortunately, the quality of the film print was not great, so all scenes were darker than they should have been and somewhat grainy, indicating perhaps that the film was not well preserved.  Still, if you are in the mood for something a bit serious but gay, this film is a good choice.",1398988800,,604,4.778846153846154

1251705,2,B0000296R7,"Very British. Take a long time to become interesting. Not the worst movie I have seen though., but not one I would recommend.",1393372800,,125,4.478260869565218
1251706,2,B0000296R7,"BOYSFRIENDS is just this side of being a British rip-off of the American film LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! Really. It's just ""deja vu all over again"" and the viewer is struck by many remarkable similarities between these two gay friendship/relationship-themed movies.

Further, BOYFRIENDS was made with considerably less attention paid to production values - particularly the sound recording of the dialogue.

Some reviewers here imply that this movie should be given a ""pass"" because it's an independent film, a labor of love done by producers and actors who ""meant well."" In the early 1980s when we were just beginning to see more than one gay film issued per year, I might have agreed. But that was then. After all, PARTING GLANCES was an independent ""labor of love"" that meant well and it holds up even now as a 5 star film by almost anyone's reckoning. Therefore I don't think the descriptive term ""indie"" can or should be used as an excuse for a product that falls very far short of the ""independent"" mark set by PARTING GLANCES over 20 years ago.

In some sense, the best thing about this film was ""I Wish I Knew the Name of the Boy of My Dreams,"" a jazzy Dinah Washington song used to great effect in the musical soundtrack.

Skip this movie. Buy instead the Dinah Washington ""Greatest Hits"" cd and DVDs of PARTING GLANCES and LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION!",1248998400,2,1357,4.761702127659574
1251707,4,B0000296R7,"Co-writers/directors Tom Hunsinger and Neil Hunter conjured this little Indie film in 1996, an examination of relationships among seven gay men that not only impresses as a non-exploitive, honest sociologic study of life in the 90s in England, it also is a film that is a healthy mix of humor and tenderness that stands up well more than ten years later.

Three couples of varying endurance gather for a weekend holiday to celebrate a birthday:  Paul (James Dreyfus, remembered as Hugh Grant's ditsy  travel book shop worker in NOTTING HILL) has been with Ben (Mark Sands) for five years but their relationship is rocky because of Paul's wandering eye for a lad he met at the funeral of his brother Mark; Matt (Michael Urwin) is celebrating his three month steady relationship with Owen (Andrew Abelson) though Owen already has the itch to move on; Will (David Coffey) brings his latest one-night stand twinkie Adam (Darren Petrucci), knowing that his chances of retaining the youth's interest are less than favorable.  Into the mix comes James (Michael McGrath), the ex-lover of the recently departed Mark whose arrival and introduction to the group occurs in the form of a tryst in the woods with Owen.

Each of the paired men face confrontations and face honesty about their pasts - recent and distant - and it is through the weekend of bed swapping that each man finds his own real needs.  And the results vary from happy reunions to factual realities of choices made.

The cast is a mixture of seasoned professional actors and newcomers who have not made subsequent films.  There is a ring of honesty in the portrayals  and the creators have opted to study compatibilities based on personality traits and needs as opposed to filling the story with the requisite soap opera subplots that tend to dampen the effect of these studies of groups and their lives.  It is not a great film, but is an honest little quiet movie with particularly good performances from James Dreyfus and Andrew Abelson.  Worth watching, even in 2007!

1251708,4,B0000296R7,"Though there is no real plot here; Boyfriends deserves a decent review. It's about the dynamics of three couples getting together for a weekend at a friends cottage in the woods; and the enteraction of the cast. It was interesting to see how each delt with their own problems. I didn't find it to be a comedy. The acting was good but those who like a plot are not going to enjoy this movie. It's very laid back. Drama, but no crisis",1101859200,6,432,4.280487804878049
1251709,1,B0000296R7,"my god I paid twenty bucks for this movie...I couldn't watch more than five minutes of it...
it stinks.",1074470400,4,103,4.473684210526316
1251710,4,B0000296R7,"This film is about gay relationships, but refreshingly, it's not about being gay.  A group of friends gather at a remote house in the English countryside for the weekend to celebrate Paul's birthday.  Paul (James Dreyfus) and Ben (Mark Sands) have been together for five years, but Matt has become bored with Ben and this couple is on the verge of breaking up.  Owen (Andrew Ableson) has been dating Matt (Michael Urwin) for three months and thinks he's finally found Mr. Right.  Owen brings Matt to the party to introduce him to his friends, but Matt is not as committed to Owen as Owen is to him.  Will (David Coffey), the oldest and most alienated member of the group of friends brings along a one night stand, Adam (Darren Petrucci), the youngest of the party attendees.  Will longs for a man who will want him.  Adam is more interested in having as much fun as he can.  Along the way, each of them must confront themselves, each other, and what they want from relationships.
In terms of content, there isn't anything that breaks new ground here, but the cast and the script are appealing enough to hold one's attention.  The movie does suffer from British sound (something I remember Richard Carpenter, creator of ""Robin of Sherwood"" that ran on Showtime in the U.S. in the mid-80s, complaining about in terms of British TV and film production) where things become difficult to hear at times.  People unfamiliar with British accents and slang may be at a double disadvantage trying to understand that which they can not hear.
I've watched the DVD a few times and I still enjoy it.  It has a non-exploitative approach to its characters and their sex lives.  And fortunately, we are saved from the ""I hate to be gay, why am I like this?"" that characterizes too many gay films prior to the mid-90s.  I do wish there was a directors' commentary track as I enjoy knowing why creators make the choices that they do.
As an additional feature, the DVD also includes an animated version of the story of Achilles.  This short film is shot in beautifully rendered stop motion animation and narrated by Derek Jacobi.
As a whole, I think this is a decent addition to any collection of gay DVDs.  People who enjoy this movie are also likely to enjoy ""Like It Is"", ""My Beautiful Laundrette"", ""Queer As Folk"" (BBC--Series One), ""Get Real"", ""Lilies"", and ""The Broken Hearts Club.""",1004140800,13,2368,4.672289156626506
1251711,1,B0000296R7,"One word boring.  This movie started out with a good concept, three couples with different problems.  However the execution of the film was terrible.  The mood throughout the film was gloomy, and none of the characters seemed to have any real emotion toward each other, even when they weren't on the rocks.  And don't believe the words on the box which make this film sound like an oscar winner, I had to prop my eyelids open with toothpicks halfway through.  To add to this, the four or five (I lost count) love triangles were to much to keep up with.  And nobodys life has that much coincidence in it.  Perhaps if you have nothing better to do with your time, or if you suffer from a sleep disorder, this movie is for you.  Like I said before: A good concept, poorly executed.",976060800,4,778,4.429577464788732
1251712,3,B0000296R7,"Though my title for this review is directed in some measure to the characters in this film, I'm speaking mostly to the reviewers turning in such pointlessly cruel comments.  I will grant that this film suffers from  ""Indie"" film syndrome (meandering plot, questionable acting,  etc.) and is shot in typically dark settings for a British film.  And yes,  some of the characterizations are about as sharp as American cheese.
This is not a film for solo viewing, unless you are an insatiable drama  queen.  Ideally, your lover/partner/whatever would be there to watch the  film as well.  Take it from someone who did just that, less than twenty  minutes ago.  It's very interesting to see how you both react to the themes  and dialogue in this film.  Who is laughing while the other one is  scowling?  Who finds something poignant that the other one views as cliche?
I have to disagree with the reviewer who said this wasn't a ""date  movie.""  I think this film would be great as a fourth or fifth date  movie, just about the time both people are starting to open up to each  other.  The men in this film are at different stages in their respective  relationships: one pair has just broken up, another pair is about to, and  one pair never really gets started.  The fact that only one of these  relationships is given a (traditionally) happy ending doesn't mean this DVD  is a downer. There is an element of practical realism to this film, and in  a time of blockbusters and ever-higher drama, I'm sure a lot of viewers  would find ""Boyfriends"" to be boring.  I wouldn't say that's a  reflection of a poor attention span...it's more like refusal to suspend  belief.  In this case, suspending belief means accepting the premise that  ordinary people are interesting, and that their problems/concerns are valid  and worthy of the telling.  It doesn't matter if you lived through the same  things, or if you've had enough late nights in bars to catalog the whole of  human behavior.  If you don't see yourself or someone you know in one of  the characters in ""Boyfriends,"" you're just refusing to use your  imagination.
I truly liked this film, despite the fleeting feeling of  being jaded, or being a bit beyond the relationships portrayed.  I  appreciate dry humor, which this film provides in adequate measure.  It was  a hoot to spot James Dreyfus, who had a recurring role in the Absolutely  Fabulous series. I had no idea he could be so (relatively) butch.
The DVD  copy I purchased includes a short animated film called  ""Achilles,"" which is a (pardon the pun) queer but fascinating  piece.  My Greek Mythology isn't up to snuff, but the story of Achilles and  his lover is presented in a quirky style (claymation?  puppets?) that is  strangely (but undeniably) erotic.  If you're a collector of  obscure/underground gay shorts, ""Achilles"" may be worth the price  of this DVD alone.
""Boyfriends"" is no better and no worse than  American films (""Broadway Damage"" comes to mind) that detail the  ins and outs of gay relationships.  It doesn't aspire to the same kind of  stage drama as ""Love! Valour! Compassion!,"" but a little of that  kind of angst goes a long way.  If you are interested in the subject of  male/male relationships and friendships, I think you'll find some value in  this DVD, as I do.
