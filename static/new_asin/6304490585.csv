891307,5,6304490585,"I have always been in love with the movie Rebecca.  I never thought I would find another version that I liked better.  Who could do better than Laurence Olivier, Charles Dance has done it.  To me he is more like the  Maxim you think of when you read the book.  The movie industry never follow  the books.  This is worth watching simply to fall in love with all over  again.",957312000,5,373,4.228571428571429
891308,5,6304490585,"I think it is interesting to read the other reviews here at Amazon.com. In my opinion, I agree with those reviewers who mention that this version of Rebecca is more believable. I can never make it through the first twenty  minutes of the old movie because Maxim is a horrible character and so is  his new wife. Maxim seemed much too harsh in the old version...and who  could love someone like that? Also, the second Mrs. de Winter was too timid  and not real at all in the old movie. She let Maxim run all over  her.
Now, I know that this recent version of the movie does not follow  the book as closely. However, as with all movies made from great books, we  should look at this version of Rebecca in a completely new light. I love  this version because Maxim is definitely a believable character and has  more warmth and expression about him than the character in the older movie.  Also, the second Mrs. de Winter had a personality about her in this movie.  She was shy, but to a believable extent. She portrayed her character very  well. And, yes, as another reviewer pointed out, you can actually  understand why Maxim fell in love with her. I could never understand that  in the old movie! There was no feeling between Maxim and his wife in that  movie. Maybe that can be attributed to the evolution in relationships since  the time that the old version of Rebecca was filmed.
So, in short, see  this version of Rebecca! You will love it. The scenes are beautiful and the  actors are wonderful...it is very well done!",956102400,18,1522,4.472727272727273
891309,5,6304490585,"Alfred Hitchcock's first American Film was excellent! Joan Fotaine stars as a narrator.although Hitchcock shows no image of Rebecca even in flashback or photo,she is clearly dominant over Fontaine's mousy character, whose  name is never mention in the movie.

891310,4,6304490585,"I know that this movie didn't match the book exactly but I feel this is a minor point as we are dealing with two different medias. Charles Dance was superb as Max De Winter. Softer and more vulnerable than Olivier ( who I  also loved in this part, for other reasons ). Ms Fox had more going for her  than Ms. Fontaine did and one could understand more why a man as  distinguished as Max would fall in love with her. Ms. Fontaine was too  wishy-washy and too cloying. Faye Dunaway was correctly obnoxious, and  Diana Rigg made the part of Mrs. Danvers more understandable. Part of this  is due to the time that this movie was shot, psychologically we are not as  limited in our outlook as the days of the Olivier,Fontaine, Anderson  filming. All in all, a very good film and one worth the viewing.",951436800,5,796,4.36734693877551

891530,5,6304490585,"""Rebecca"" is one of my hands-down very favorite books! This adaptation is very, very good - I really enjoyed it. While some things were changed from book to screen, and I feel like Maxim and his second wife's relationship was made even more intimate and warmer here in this miniseries, I really did not mind. Some things, of course, were kept the same, and you can clearly see that.

The countryside (especially depicted in the beginning of the movie, when the narrator is still working for Mrs Van Hopper) is so beautiful it made me want to cry!!

The characters are great, and they really work well. What drew me to this was Diana Rigg, who I've seen in The Avengers and Game of Thrones. But Charles Dance and Emilia Fox portray their roles brilliantly, and are skilled in their own right.

All in all I really enjoyed this and would highly recommend it. In fact, this is a DVD that I would buy and re-watch.",1471132800,,910,4.469879518072289

891532,5,6304490585,"The Hitchcock movie, ""Rebecca"", with Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson, and the always-mesmerizing George Sanders, is a five-star classic, so I felt at first as if I should give this filmed version four stars.

But, y'know  -- we really like this version here, especially as it's a bit closer to the book, and more fleshed out in certain sections.  It also doesn't seem to drag out things until important elements are revealed, as does Hitchcock's movie -- this slightly more modern take, with less quaking and nerviness of the female lead, is appreciated by a few of the males here, who, upon first view of the Hitchcock ""Rebecca"" some years ago, started saying things like, ""Jeesh ... when is something going to HAPPEN?""  They're not off the beam -- in the classic film, it's quite a chick flick as the characters and settings unfold. The undercurrents and threat of Hitchcock's telling of the tale is fabulous, with a fantastic climax, however, repeat viewings (worth it!), clearly make the viewer feel impatient to get to the uncovering of realities.

In this version, the plot moves along to denouements a bit more quickly, and more thoroughly, and the ambiguity of how life and people are perceived by the main character, the innocent girl, is more clearly seen (in retrospect, if this is a person's first exposure to the story). And that's a primary theme -- that unless one get's out of one's own head and probes the mysteries of life and relationships more, one doesn't find truth. All that old fashioned British reserve is frustrating.

It doesn't hurt that there are a few short scenes filmed that show the romance and intimacy of Maxim and his second wife, albeit still PG-13 style. Also, Emilia Fox's performance seems closer to the character as it's portrayed in the book, and her looks, demeanor, and youth fit better to the second Mrs. DeWinter as drawn by Daphne Du Maurier -- even though Fontaine was wonderful in her portrayal, the youth of Fox just fits the bill better.  Charles Dance also seems to be cast exactly right -- his version of Maxim is terrific.  It just seems as if this production had an overall better script, and some updating to the style of the story, that makes it just work -- for these times, anyway.  Also, the little coda of the ending is nicely done, and satisfying.",1463875200,10,2326,4.766169154228856

891776,5,6304490585,"I've watched all the versions of Rebecca, including the one with Jeremy Brett, but this version is the closest to the characters as written by Du Maurier. Charles Dance (albeit a little older ) was perfect in his portrayal of Maxim De Winter. Sophisticated, brooding, haunted and vulnerable. I loved the love scenes. The book was written in 1938 by a female, and love scenes were not typically spelled out in books at that time. However there were enough innuendos in the book that suggested that Maxim and his bride had a unique and passionate intimate relationship. My only complaint of this version was actually showing Rebecca. She should have been left for what she was worth - an enigma. Emilia Fox and Diana Rigg were absolutely perfect in their respective roles as the second Mrs. De Winter and Mrs. Danvers. I hope the nay Sayers will give this version a chance. The best of the three IMO. This is from someone who is an ardent Hitchcock and Jeremy Brett fan.

891859,2,6304490585,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this TV movie remake of the 1940 classic...

Rebecca (1997) is a TV remake of Rebecca (1940), the winner of Best Picture for 1940 at the Academy Awards.  That classic was a David O. Selznick/Alfred Hitchcock collaboration, directed by Hitchcock.  The movie is a classic.  It's dark, haunting, gothic, shadowy, has a great musical score by Franz Waxman, top notch acting, and was filmed in black and white, which was the right way to go.  It has Judith Anderson playing the role of Mrs. Danvers and giving an outstanding performance which got her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  It has Laurence Olivier.  It has Joan Fontaine, who was nominated for an Academy Award.  Everything about the movie is perfect.

This remake?  Where do I start?  It's in color and lacks everything I mentioned above.  The atmosphere just isn't there like the original.  Mrs. Danvers in this one can't hold a candle to the original Mrs. Danvers.  I don't know why this movie is rated so highly.  Maybe a lot of people have never seen the original.  In addition, I don't care if this remake follows the Daphne du Maurier book more closely.  It's an inferior movie to the original, no matter which way you slice it.

891938,2,6304490585,"I've never read the book ""Rebecca"" but after watching this remake of the Alfred Hitchcock version, I intend to do so. The remake expands a bit on the relationship between Maxim and the second Mrs. De Winter unlike the original. There are love scenes in this version absent from the first. Here we see displays of Maxim's love for his new wife and not just her love for him. However, Charles Dance is less attractive and charismatic in the role of Maxim De Winter than Sir Lawerence Olivier. His portrayal of the older and more worldly husband to the younger and more naive wife at times borders on being creepy. Emilia Fox is homely, boring and bland compared to Joan Fountaine as the original 2nd Mrs. de Winter. There is no real chemistry between the two actors, which makes their falling in love totally unbelievable. Their love scenes are at times literally painful to watch. Faye Dunaway can't hold a candle to Florence Bates as Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper. She overacts in EVERY scene as if she's again playing Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest"". Diana Riggs as Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper lacks the menacing presence of Judith Anderson, which is a major disappointment in this version. The estate Manderley, even in color, is far less impressive than in the original. When viewing Rebecca's room in the original, I found myself wishing I could actually walk through such a beautiful room. As seen in this version, it simply looks like an average bedroom in a home of that period. The changes in dialog and scenes from the original are at times confusing and disconcerting. The character Ben in the original was pathetic but in this remake he seems comedic. In the original version, the inquest including the fainting of Mrs. De Winter, was better written. The scenes with Flavell also were better written in the original than in this version. George Sanders as Flavell had the charisma and charm to play the romantic interest of Rebecca. Jonathan Cake does not. The addition of the scenes from the ball in which people gossip about the new Mrs. De Winter don't add anything to this version either. The scene where Mrs. Danvers encourages the new Mrs. De Winter to commit suicide in the original was dramatic and emotional. Not so in this version. There are other scenes in this version that don't compare to the original as well. Overall, comparing this remake to the Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" is like comparing cubic zirconia to a diamond. It attempts to capture the brilliance of the original but in the end, is nothing more than a cheap imitation.",1354579200,2,2555,4.782805429864253

But it is well worth seeing just to watch Diana Rigg in her Emmy winning role as Mrs. Danvers.  She is much more Freudian as she handles Rebecca's underwear and she, too, is not punished for burning down Mandalay but rescued by Maxim.

891943,3,6304490585,"This 1997 British 2-part TV miniseries of Daphne Du Maurier's most beloved novel REBECCA isn't going to endanger the prestige of Hitchcock's landmark 1940 film (or indeed the masterful 1979 BBC miniseries version - regarded by many as quite possibly the definitive screen ""Rebecca""), but it's a serviceable adaptation nevertheless.

Whilst holidaying with her employer, the incessantly social-climbing New Yorker Mrs Van Hopper (Faye Dunaway) in Monte Carlo, a shy and demure young Girl (Du Maurier never gave her a name - played by Emilia Fox) is swept off her feet by the attentions of the brooding, mysterious Maxim de Winter (Charles Dance).  Maxim is trying to escape a past that holds too many painful memories, which the Girl effectively blocks out with her spirited youth and wondering naivete.

Their whirlwind romance ends in marriage, much to Mrs Van Hopper's surprise, and the pair return to Maxim's ancestral home of Manderley, on the Cornish Coast.  At Manderley, the Girl discovers a household still haunted and indeed ruled from beyond the grave by Maxim's first wife Rebecca.  Housekeeper Mrs Danvers (Diana Rigg) doesn't seem too excited by the prospect of her new mistress, and attempts to sabotage the Girl's marriage to Maxim at every possible turn.

As the de Winter's marriage becomes strained by Maxim's unpredictable mood-swings, the Girl's fervent attempts to become the wife she's sure will finally thaw him and the machinations of Mrs Danvers - clinging to the memory of the beloved Rebecca - an accident at sea reveals a ghastly new clue to Rebecca's puzzling death...

This version of REBECCA doesn't stay entirely faithful to the novel (devotees of Du Maurier's original will be able to instantly pinpoint where screenwriter Arthur Hopcraft has steered away from the text), but in spirit this version is fine, and creates the appropriate mood that you want from this classic gothic romance.  The biggest mistake in this version is that fact that we actually SEE Rebecca herself.  The strength of the Hitchcock film (and indeed the book) is that Rebecca's enigmatic presence can still be keenly felt by everybody despite the fact that she is dead.  In this version, actress Lucy Cohu plays the part of Rebecca in several flashbacks and dream sequences, and although we never get a complete picture of her (the camera is either focused on her eyes or mouth), the illusion is ruined.

It's quite lovely to have Emilia Fox as the Girl (her mother Joanna David played the same role in the '79 BBC miniseries opposite Jeremy Brett as Maxim and Anna Massey as Mrs Danvers).  Ms Fox carries on the 'mantle' quite magnificently.  Happily their performances in the part are quite different and can each be enjoyed for their own unique strengths.

Charles Dance is quite acceptable for Maxim; probably a bit unconventional on the physical side but more than equipped to portray the character's inner turmoil.  Diana Rigg doesn't get nearly enough screen-time as Mrs Danvers but she's very effective in the part.  Geraldine James and Denis Lill are Maxim's clucking sister Beatrice and brother-in-law Giles; Jonathan Cake is Rebecca's cousin Jack Favell.",1337731200,2,3173,5.0847784200385355

It was compelling and lyrical without being too wordy. The first television series I watched, based on the book, starred Joanna David and Jeremy Brett. This production was memorable and led me to watch Rebecca starring Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. The production was amazing. Charles Dance was superb as Max de Winter, and so was Emila Fox who starred as the second Mrs.de Winter. The only draw back was the serious editing. The uncut version, available in the U.K. only, enhanced the production. I only wish it was available in North America. Why it was cut like that, I cannot imagine.

I liked the Olivier/Fontaine version but hoped that a longer movie would go more in-depth to his character, their courtship, some of the other scenes. The Brett/David movie was good and is the most accurate of the three as far as a replay from the book, but I didn't feel they had any genuine chemistry.

This, although in some ways least like the book, was most like how I had always wanted to see it done, how I had always pictured the book to be.  I feel this one shows more sides of both Maxim and Mrs. De Winter's character then either of the other ones showed. I could see how they fell in love with each other- I could see what appealed to one about the other.  When they were home, you could see both how he loved her,and yet was clearly hiding something.

The argument scene after the fancy dress ball is an example of something that was added, but I felt it was necessary, because her reflections after that are absolutely crucial but since they were silent reflections, short of voice-overs I don't really see how it could have been conveyed.  I don't remember the actor who played Favell but he was the best out of the three by far.

If you are watching this movie for the creepy Mrs. Danvers-that is its weakest link which is why people usually consider this the weakest out of the three.  I usually roll my eyes at people's statements about implied sexual relationships in books and movies, feeling it shows nothing but our obsessed society, but this was pretty blatant.  That and the attempt to visualize Rebecca- a good attempt, but not up to the mark (her voice was obnoxious, her walk too swaggering)- is why this got four instead of five stars.

If you are watching it for the love story, this one will probably be your favorite.  If you are watching it for the creepy mystery, skip this one and track down the Jeremy Brett version.",1311724800,13,1976,4.443213296398892

- Maxim de Winter looks much older than he's supposed to be, and hence the age difference with the girl is striking.
- His manners are very straighforward (for example, he stares at her at their first encounter)
- Some lines have been added that modify the spirit of the movie (for example when Maxim says in the beginning ""I don't know how to deal with you"" or ""This moment is not that great"").

My verdict on this version ('97) is that everyone is wonderful except
Charles Dance. Totally inappropriate casting. He's all freckled and
spotty and not the slightest bit attractive. He's supposed to be old
enough to be her father, yes, but not a father who had her in his 30's!!

That being said, I have no idea why all the film versions skip (at
least as far as I have noticed) the -- to my mind-- crucial scene in
the book when the narrator finally tells Mrs. Danvers that she doesn't
much care what the former Mrs. DeWinter would have done because SHE is
Mrs. DeWinter now. This is after the ""You should be the one who's dead""

However, this US-DVD has been cut (the UK-DVD is quite a bit longer), so I give this butchered version 0 points and end up with 2. If you have a codefree player, get the UK-DVD.

I find the love between Maxim and the second Mrs. DeWinter to be more compelling in this version than in the Hitchcock.  Our office had a tradition of watching hour-length episodes of films on video at lunch.  We watched dozens over several years, and the tradition began with this production of Rebecca.  I love both the Masterpiece Theatre version and the Hitchcock in the same way I love both the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle and the Keira Knigtley/Matthew MacFayden versions of Pride and Prejudice.  I have both versions of Pride and Prejudice on DVD and both versions of Rebecca on VHS.  The power of the Hitchcock is in the passion and romance.  This version is more subtle and suspenseful.  Here the DeWinters are deeply committed spouses, willing to endure suffering for the sake of each other, not mere lovers.  Joan Fontaine is angelic in the Hitchcock.  She excels at portraying the second Mrs. DeWinter's passion for her husband.  Emilia Fox's excellent performance emphasizes the character's awkwardness.  The costume party scene is particularly brilliant in this version.  It's given more time to unfold and is so effective that it's painful to watch.  Charles Dance is a fine, subtle actor.  His Maxim is excellent, more impatient and volcanic than Olivier's.  His portrayal of Tulkinghorn in Bleak House is bloodcurdling.  You can't judge this version of Rebecca by the Hitchcock.  They both must be enjoyed on their own merits.  I read the novel because of this version, not because of the Hitchcock.  I have never seen the Jeremy Brett version.

892022,4,6304490585,"I wasn't expecting high art and I hadn't read the book.  I may have seen the Hitchcock film but if so I forgot it.  So I didn't have a lot of standards to measure this film by and I was free just to take it as it was... and to enjoy it.

First...it's long. When a book is condensed into a two hour film a lot of elements have to be eliminated, so this Materpiece Theater production allows for a lot of interesting details to be included.

It's set in Monte Carlo and in Cornwall so there is plenty of pleasure for the eye.  Also, as a period piece it shows all the fun styles of the times.

The story seemed a little pat in the beginning and I feared it would be too predictable---wealthy widower chooses plain young working class woman over a bevy of overdressed, vapid society women.  We know there will be problems awaiting her, namely the ghost of Rebecca, the reputedly amazing beauty who was the first wife of the widow, Maxim de Winter.  How can such a plain girl who ""is not used to be rich"" navigate the ways of high society, knowing she'll be compared constantly to the amazing Rebecca.  She has to endure the cruelty of the miserable housemistress, Mrs. Danvers who clearly was in love with Rebecca.
Worst is her fear that she will fail to hold the love of Maxim as he realizes that she can never measure up to her predecessor.

In the second half, the plot becomes even more complex which holds your interest as surprise after surprise is revealed.  It's a good story!

The production is up to the high level of Masterpiece Theater and the acting is first rate.  Charles Dance is impressive as Maxim de Winter, displaying the pride of his position which sometimes borders on impatience and criticism of Wife II.  (She is, curiously, never named.)  He makes the character real, and thorougly understandable as he battles his own inner demons. He is also quite strikingly handsome and cuts a fine figure in his 1920's style swim suit.

Diana Rigg is wonderfully evil as the dementedly devoted housekeeper.  Her greasy gray bob and slash of too-red lipstick make for an almost humourous portayal of the dreadful woman.  Rigg gives a well rounded performance, eventually letting us see the weakness that underlay her cruelty.

My only quibble about casting is that of Emilia Fox as the heroine, the new Mrs. de Winter.  She is beyond plain, in my opinion, veering on dowdy and it is hard to see how Maxim would have fallen so much in love with her in a few days as to want to marry her.  The only plausible explanation I could come up with  is that she is the polar opposite of Rebecca, the woman he's trying to forget...so her very lack of beauty of either form or face is in her favor.  Also, she's young and he can project whatever he wants to see onto her.  But that's probably going further into the psychology than the film intends.

As the host of Masterpiece Theater said, this isn't a work for English teachers, but it's a good show and if you don't expect Olivier or Hitchcock, you may really enjoy it.",1250208000,,3020,4.457194899817851

892133,5,6304490585,"This film adaptation of the novel ""Rebecca"" by Daphne du Maurier superbly portrays the elegance and mystery of Maxim de Winter whose first wife died in a boating accident and the subsequent romance and marriage to his second wife. Their chance meeting on the coast of Monte Carlo in the 1920s leads to an unexpected May-December romance which surprises everyone who knows Max. He is considered a handsome wealthy aristocratic gentleman, set in his ways, not likely to engage in a whirlwind romance. Yet, Maxim fell in love with his second wife within a short period of time, amidst the surroundings of Monte Carlo among a circle of wealthy society friends. Amazingly, the viewer never learns the name of the second Mrs. de Winter who is played by Emilia Fox. The second Mrs. de Winter is a charming, quiet and well educated young lady in her early twenties who had a job as companion to Mrs. Van Hopper, a spoiled rich elderly woman who loves to engage in gossip and socialize with members of her social set. The drama and mystery of the novel unfolds after the couple returns to England to Manderley, the magnificent old mansion where the de Winters reside ...

The new Mrs. de Winter settles into her role as the mistress of Manderley. She gradually learns household routines and her duties as Maxim's wife and explores the great mansion and lovely natural surroundings, plus the nearby coast. A palpable tension exists between  Maxim's second wife and Mrs. Danvers the head housekeeper. Mrs. Danvers took great pride in her special relationship with Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. She has not emotionally accepted Rebecca's death and behaves in a sinister, haunting manner. Diana Rigg does an outstanding performance in depicting the deep dark churning emotions within this character. The new Mrs. de Winter creates a picture of Rebecca in idealistic terms, as the beautiful and perfect wife for Maxim. She feels inadequate in measuring up to this unrealistic ideal image. When she attempts to share these feelings with Max, he reassures her but also dismisses her feelings as something which can be overcome with time and effort. It is as if the ghost of Rebecca hovers within Manderley and is haunting the second Mrs. de Winter.

When Rebecca's boat is discovered not far from the harbor along with her body on board, the novel becomes more complex and intense. Daphne du Maurier creates dense drama which gradually uncovers well kept secrets hidden within the ancient walls of Manderley. Social appearances were deceiving, it turns out Max and Rebecca were not the ideal couple they portrayed themselves to be. The mysterious drowning death of Rebecca holds many clues but the viewer needs to see this film or read the book to understand just how great a writer Daphne du Maurier really is. The manner in which the author gradually peels away the layers of the complex problems which affects the lives of this married couple is outstanding. She manages to hold the reader's attention throughout the book by playing upon reader's emotions regarding the mystery and intrigue of the relationship between Max and Rebecca. If their closely guarded secret was revealed, it could result in the ruin the marriage of the new Mrs. de Winter and her husband and create a huge scandal. This film adaptation of the book does a superb job in providing a colorful visual tapestry which ties together many mysteries revealed at the end of the book. The casting of roles was outstanding. I read the book many years ago and this film elegantly and dramatically reveals the deep hidden secrets of the past. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1238630400,4,3620,4.911764705882353
892134,3,6304490585,"Daphne Du Maurier's ""Rebecca"" is the first novel that got me hooked on gothic novels, and I find it unforgettable till today. Hitchcock's screen adaptation of Rebecca will also remain a classic, with Laurence Olivier portraying the brooding Maxim de Winter and Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs De Winter.

Although this version of Rebecca doesn't compare in terms of brilliance to Hitchcocok's version, it does have its merits - firstly, the length - at 3 hrs long, there is a lot more covered in this version [though the writers did take many liberties with the novel] than in Hitchcock's version. This version also stays true to the time period in which Rebecca was set - the 1920s vs the 1930s as portrayed in Hitchcock's version.

As for the actors, I thought Emilia Fox [who also portrayed Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice] did an excellent job as the second Mrs de Winter - she plays the mousy Mrs de Winter very well and credibly portrays her character's change to a person of more strength as she realises how much Maxin really needs her. Charles Dance lacks the brooding looks  that was effectively portrayed by Laurence Olivier, and he is also lacking in the looks department, but his character portrayal of Maxim de Winter was not altogether deficient as we still get the sense of his weakness here. Diana Rigg was not very convincing as the sinister Mrs Danvers, and I thought Judith Anderson who played her in the Hitchcock version was far superior in her malevolence and obsessive affection for Rebecca.

In the novel, we don't really know much about Rebecca - and she is like a menacing phantom, unseen but whose 'presence' permeates the novel. In this version, Rebecca is given a voice and a body, which I thought was unnecessary. I think the strength  of the story lies in the mystery surrounding Rebecca - was she purely malevolent? It's like piecing a puzzle, and this dramatization also lacks the atmosphere that made both the novel and Hitchcock's adaptation such successes.

On the whole, this was a watchable adaptation of Rebecca, but not as intriguing as the novel or movie version.",1236988800,,2135,4.8038147138964575
892135,5,6304490585,"I have read the book and seen the Hitchcock movie (both several times). I though this was a beautifully done picture in technicolor, highlighting the beauty of Monte Carlo and Manderly. The opening scene with the overlay of names, backed up with the haunting music, the ocean lapping against the rocks, the fog-shrouded cove with the half-submerged boat bouncing in the turbulent surf and Rebecca's image superimposed over the scene. An evocative scene for those familiar with the story of Rebecca and as good as any opera overture foretelling tragedy. This film did take liberties with the book and Hitchcock but I liked it; particularly the overly sexual attraction between the two. I often wondered why Max ever married her other than as a reaction to his hatred for Rebecca. Olivier was cold and distant and perhaps that was the way it was suppose to be - Jane Fontaine was shy and demure, as it was suppose to be. But in the book she often laments the fact that Max treats her like a child and often wonders whether he loves her. This display of superb sexual attraction in this film between the two, makes their love believable and clearly shows how together they could live through the tragedy.

892139,2,6304490585,"There should be some sort of rule that if Alfred Hitchcock did it, then it should never be adapted or remade again -- you only compare it unfavorably to his work. In the case of the BBC's ""Rebecca,"" it's high on story fidelity but lacking in gothic atmosphere, very slow, and with a cast that is hit-and-miss.

A young girl (Emilia Fox) is at Monte Carlo with her employer, where she meets and befriends the wealthy Maxim de Winter (Charles Dance). When she's due to leave, he asks her to marry him -- though he was supposedly heartbroken over his wife Rebecca's death -- and whisks her back to Cornwall, to his ancient family estate Manderley.

But Manderly is haunted by Rebecca's presence, partly because of the ominous housekeeper (Diana Rigg), who is still obsessively devoted to Rebecca. The new Mrs. de Winter believes that Maxim still love Rebecca -- until the horrific secrets of Rebecca's life and death are revealed. And a smashed boat with a body has been found in the nearby bay.

One thing you can't fault ""Rebecca"" with is fidelity to Daphne DuMaurier's original novel. This miniseries sticks like glue to the words and events of the book. Unfortunately it sticks a little too slavishly at times, which leads to the miniseries being rather long and kind of dull at times.

Not to mention the famed ""window-suicide"" scene, when Danvers tries to hypnotize her new mistress into walking out of a window. It's a powerful scene, but I'd love to see anyone try to spontaneously commit suicide from a tiny, high-up window about ten feet off the ground.

The BBC has always been terrible with ominous atmosphere. There is zero gothic flavor, no suspense, and that is what ""Rebecca"" should be about -- not a murder mystery. They stick to what they know, with lots of sumptuous British sets and period details, especially in the artificial glamour of Monte Carlo's hotels, and the costume ball.

The casting is spotty -- Emelia Fox is excellent as Ms. de Winter, looking mousy and childlike, but gaining new strength as she realizes how much Maxim needs her. Dance gives an enthusiastic but rather pallid performance. And Rigg does an amazing job with a terribly written character: Mrs. Danvers is turned into a pitiful figure rather than a frightening one, who breaks down crying in front of everyone.

But there is another big flaw -- we see all of Rebecca in bits and pieces. The power of the character is in never seeing this uber-femme fatale, and so seeing her entire body, bits of her face and hearing her voice all take away from it. Rebecca's ""power"" over Manderley seems to die when we see her.

Faithful but dull, ""Rebecca"" loses a lot of what should have made it shine, like gothic atmosphere, drama and an absent namesake. It's passable as a BBC miniseries, but try the Hitchcock version instead.",1154131200,8,2814,4.728571428571429

I don't think we're meant to know.

Now to get on to a review of this version of Rebecca.  It at least has the story taking place in the 1920's as anyone who has read the book knows is actually the time when it took place, and not the late 1930's, as the top-notch Hitchcock movie has it taking place.

Other than that it is not nearly as good as the movie.  Diana Rigg is such a good actress and the way she played Mrs. Danvers had none of the truly scary and obsessive qualtity of Judith Anderson's performance.  I'm surprised that she did such a poor job of playing Mrs. Danvers.

And the person who played Maxim wasn't very physically attractive.  He was much less likable than Olivier in the part, grumpy and bad-tempered, rather than brooding and obsessed as Olivier played him.

And much of the story was changed.  The only thing Hitchcock changed in the movie was the fact Maxim killed Rebecca on purpose, and the fact that the second Mrs. DeWinter went to London with Maxim.

In this version Maxim rescues Mrs. Danvers from Manderly as it is burning, there is no mention of anything like that.  And then there's the meeting between Mrs. VanHopper, Maxim and the second Mrs. DeWinter that NEVER took place in the book.

Evey though Faye Dunaway is not one of my favorite actresses, I really like her portrayal of Mrs. VanHopper.  She brings the sex-obsessed, frustrated, wealthy, unattractive middle-aged woman who has to hire male escorts side of Mrs. VanHopper that was only hinted at in the movie and book out in the open.

This movie doesn't have the haunting, scary, atmosphere of the book or the movie.  And the most faithful adaption of Rebecca was one made for PBS years ago.  I don't remember who played most of the parts, but Joanna David played the second Mrs. DeWinter and I think Eugenia Massay played Mrs. Danvers very much in the style of Judith Anderson.

I was so disappointed when I saw this on TV because Charles Dance and Diana Rigg are such wonderful actors, and they are wasted in this watered-down version of a great classic story. Even their vast talents combined couldn't make this watchable. The version done by the BBC in 1979 or 1980 was fabulous, with Jeremy Brett as Maxim de Winter but it has never been released on video or dvd. And the girl who plays the wife in the new version is actually the daughter of Joanna David, who played the same role in the BBC show.

Pass on the 1997 version--it's soap opera dramatics and hysteria.",1105315200,16,626,4.530973451327434

892207,3,6304490585,"When I first heard of this production on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre, I was thrilled with anticipation regarding how it would be played. Would it rival Hitchcock's masterpiece? Would it be marketed as a romantic escape?

Unfortunately, althought this version of Du Maurier's classic follows the book very closely and is over 2 hours longer than the original 1940s film, it just doesn't measure up to either Hitchcock or the book. Hitchcock downplays Du Maurier's portrayal of the strange relationship between men and women.  Men are omnipotent---women, merely serve.  Rebecca, too strong must go.  Hitchcock plays up the Gothic touches with fog, music and a weakly played Max De Winter. The nameless heroine gathers strength as Rebecca is revealed to be intrinsically evil.  But this is not Du Maurier's 'Rebecca'.  In the book there is no win in the ending---the heroine simply remains a caretaker as she was in the beginning of the novel; her charge has changed from Mrs. Van Hopper to Maxim.  The couple drifts like sad wanderers from place to place; as Du Maurier puts it, ""There is no resurrection."" In this adaptation and in Hitchcock, love seems to conquer all---an idea completely alien and misunderstood by most readers of Du Maurier.

First and foremost, the girl playing the narrator is not gauche or dependent enough--she has too much spunk and sparkle lurking behind the lank hair and the school girl dresses. Fontaine was ever so much more desperate to please as I think Du Maurier's heroine was meant to be. Du Maurier doesn't even give her a name.  Dame Diana Rigg is an equally austere Mrs Danvers, but her portrayal is much too sad, not malicious enough and definitely suggests a [physical] attraction to her former mistress which seems mournful rather than simply obsessive like DuMaurier's character in the novel or Dame Anderson's character in Hitchcock's film. Charles Dance is not as taut nerved as Olivier, but he passes as an okay Max DeWinter with perhaps a third of Olivier's charm. Still, he comes off as weak as does Olivier in Hitchcock's version---neither fully portraying the strong silent brooding character of Maxim in the book.  Lastly, giving Rebecca a voice and a body, is a mistake. Du Maurier's book is so compelling simply because we don't know anything about Rebecca and hence can envision whatever femme fatale we choose--the real Rebecca is a ghost; she remains a mystery to the very end--we don't know if she is really malevolent---we only have Maxim's word--or excuse for his own violent actions. We don't even understand her motives fully even after the production moves to the final scene at Manderley.

Nevertheless, if you simply love everything 'Rebecca', you will at least like this version, but, I guarantee it will provoke you to find a copy of the Hitchcock version at your local rental store or better yet a worn copy of the book at your library!",1042588800,80,2899,4.944444444444445
892208,5,6304490585,"I watched this movie only after I read the book by Daphe Du Maurier several times at different ages. I am glad to say that it was very close to what I had imagined while I read the book. I certainly feel 3 hours are required for doing justice to the book. Though, it would have been much better had they spent more time showing how Maxim de Winter and the narrator fall in love in Monte Carlo. I feel that was too hurried and several details were left out. The last part where Max de Winter tries to save Danvers from the burning Manderley ought to have been avoided as it wasn't part of the story and only added melodrama.
The cast for this second version with Charles Dance, Emilia Fox and Diana Rigg couldn't have been better. The perfect English looking Charles Dance is the only one who could portray the reserved, austre and noble Max de Winter. I feel the difference in age between Max De Winter and the narrator was very accurately portrayed in the film. An older, more mature looking man was very vital for this role. Though the book says that Maxim was about twice the age of the young narrator, around 40, I always imagined Maxim to look older than that with all the fear and suffering he had undergone. Olivier certainly was not cut for this role in Hitchcock's version. I think Emilia Fox was also great with her lost, shy look.
I feel this version is probably the closest it can get to the book and the characters. The cast chosen was the best by far.",1037750400,26,1465,4.330909090909091
892209,5,6304490585,"While I will always like the Hitchcock film better, this adaptation is a great example of how a book should be turned into a movie. This will always be a classic love story between a young woman and an older mysterious widower that changes and matures with tragedy and the revelation of secrets. As with the originial film, this movie is suspenseful, romantic, and tragic. This faithful adapation from the book expands on issues that were skimmed over in the orginial movie but should have been filmed in black and white. In the new adaptation, the feelings between Maxim and the new Mrs. de Winter are underscored with some blatant scenes where they are still laying in bed and with more dubtle touches, such as holding hands when they walk or when Maxin touches Mrs. de W's face while in conversation. However, Lawrence Olivier somehow portrayed a more tragic and angry Maxim than is seen in this version.",1031011200,55,907,4.746835443037975

892211,5,6304490585,"It's 1927, and we are in Monte Carlo, a most romantic place... The heroine of the novel, a very young girl (she is also the storyteller) is employed as a companion to a vulgar, rich woman, Mrs. Van Hopper. There she meets Maxim de Winter, a sophisticated, attractive older man, very rich, the owner of a splendid, ancient estate called Manderley. They marry very soon and return to England. Perfect happiness eludes her - she becomes obsessed with Rebecca, Maxim's first wife, who mysteriously drowned in the bay ten months before Monte Carlo. Rebecca's ghost seems to be everywhere - the housekeeper, the creepy, murderous Mrs. Danvers is still obsessively devoted to her and keeps her rooms just as they were before her death. The second Mrs. de Winter knows that everyone compares her to Rebecca, and is convinced she must be a disappointment - ""You'll never get the better of her"", Mrs. Danvers says. Frank Crawley, the estate manager, tells her Rebecca was ""the most beautiful creature I ever saw"", but adds that, to a husband, ""kindness, sincerity and modesty are worth all the beauty and wit in the world"". That sounds very odd: if Rebecca was so perfect, surely she must have been kind and sincere? Rebecca's death and past life seem to be shrouded in mystery, until one day, after a strong storm, the boat in which she drowned is found by the shore. A painful scene follows: the second Mrs. de Winter learns the awful truth. Have she and Maxim already lost their chance of happiness?
I must say that, when I read the novel by Daphne du Maurier on which this film was based, I was just 12 and somehow lacking in understanding. I wondered for days why the writer NEVER mentions the heroine's christian name... Still the pictures of Maxim and the heroine were very clear in my mind. Emilia Fox and Charles Dance ARE them, just as Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine in the 1940 Hitchcock (in my opinion) fall short of a perfect fit. Emilia Fox's Mrs. de Winter, for example, is by no means a weak young woman, helplessly awaiting disaster: when she discovers she is truly needed she finds a strength she didn't know she possessed. Charles Dance's Maxim is the supreme embodiment of high-society sophistication and handsomeness, which, combined with his haunted past, tenderness and brooding intensity is surely enough to make him irresistible! Also, Jonathan Cake is truly loathsome as Jack Favell, Rebecca's lecherous and dishonest more-than-cousin. Diana Rigg plays a Mrs. Danvers who, although more mellow and vulnerable than the character in the novel and previous film version, is nonetheless superlative.

7873108,5,6304490585,"Daphne Du Maurier, born on May 13, 1907 in London, was one of the most popular authors of her day. She wrote dozens of booksbiographies, plays, and collections of letters as well as works of fiction. Today she is best remembered for only a handful of novels, including Rebecca (1938) and My Cousin Rachel (195l); perhaps only Alfred Hitchcock remembers she wrote a collection called The Birds and Other Stories (1952).

Gothic thriller, romance, ghost stories usually have three stock characters: a moody hero, a young heroine, and an older female household member. Their attributes are interchangeable: both the hero or household member can be seen as a villain; the heroine is more than likely a ward or a governess; and the female household member tends to be a housekeeper or unpaid relative. I would add the ancestral home owned by the hero as a character, especially one with turrets and a proper name; after all, the bulk of the storys action takes place there.
Du Mauriers thrillers are no exception to these rules; in fact, her Rebecca contains all four characterizations.

Here are a few lines about Rebecca with a slight plot sketch and nod to its first filming that appeared in a June 2015 Strand Magazine article:

""The novel Rebecca is a curious hybrida mixture of romance, murder mystery, and the gothic. The romance was brought to life by Hitchcock and Hollywood through Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, but it is at the core of the novel as well. A naive young woman never named in either the novel or the filmis alone in the world (a paid companion to an older, coarser, social-climbing woman) until she meets the handsome, wealthy, and recently widowed Maxim de Winter. He had been married to the accomplished, beautiful Rebecca who tragically died in a boating accident off the south coast of Cornwall near the de Winter family estate of Manderley.

""The mystery evolves slowly and involves the death of Rebecca. . .

""The gothic elements revolve around the house itselfManderleyand its menacing housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, one of the eeriest figures in fiction who...terrorizes her new mistress.""

Perhaps the Gothic female household member and the Gothic large manor house are forever linked. An online Strand Magazine post of June 22, 2017 lists Ten of the Best On-Screen Villains. Heres what it says about the Mrs. Danvers performance by Judith Anderson in the 1940 Hitchcock film:

""Who needs ghosts when Mrs. Danvers is your chief attendant and tormentor? As much a part of Manderley as its newel posts and wainscoting, Judith Andersons icy, spectral countenance seems to inhabit every shadow of the estate. 'Youre overwrought, madam. Ive opened a window for you.' Pure evil.""

Although Hitchcocks Rebecca won an Oscar for best movie of 1940, my favorite visual version is Masterpiece Theatres 1997 one. Masterpiece Theatre, the drama anthology television series premiering on PBS (Public Broadcasting System) on January 10, 1971, has long satisfied my craving for classic and contemporary Gothic thriller films with their great forbidding mansions; lovely British country sides and coastlines; well-cast actors and actresses; and hypnotic musical scores. Masterpiece has aired Rebecca in two different productions.

The first television version appeared on PBS Mystery! (a spin-off of Masterpiece), Season 1 of 1980-81. It stars Jeremy Brett as Max de Winter, Joanna David as the second Mrs. de Winter, and Anna Massey as Mrs. Danvers. It was praised for its high BBC production quality and for using the music of Claude Debussy instead of some dated 'horror music' that often mars 1970s films. Unfortunately, a digital recording of this production is out of print. (Amazon has it available for streaming.)

The 1997 Rebecca appeared on Masterpiece Theatre in the 1996-97 Season 26 and was introduced by Russell Baker who hosted from 1992 to 2004. Here is what Baker said about this adaptation of Du Mauriers novel:

""Rebecca may be the most popular ghost story to come out of England since Charles Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol. It was published in 1938 by Daphne Du Maurier and instantly became a huge bestseller. Then, as an Alfred Hitchcock movie, it won the Academy Award as best picture of 1940.

""Tonight Masterpiece Theatre presents...a brand new two-part television version.

""Now, at the center of the story is a haunted houseManderley. Its mistress, the brilliant, beautiful Rebecca de Winter has died before the story opens. Her drowned body has been found in the surf off the rocky coast that borders Manderley. Her husband Max de Winter, apparently crushed by her death, has fled and is traveling in the south of France. He is not only charming but very rich and, not surprising, highly attractive to adventurous, worldly women who would love to be the next mistress of Manderley.

""Now, what none of them realize is that Manderley would be a formidable challenge for any woman who tries to replace Rebecca. Its a house filled with dark spirits who don't want a new mistress. One of these dark spirits is dead; the other alive.""

An internet movie database has the actors who portray the three main characters in a slightly different manner for this miniseries: Charles Dance, Diana Riggs, Geraldine James. The dashing Charles Dance is Max. Diana Riggs is Mrs. Danvers, and Geraldine James is Beatrice, Maxs sister. One has to go to the complete cast listings to discover that Emilia Fox is the second Mrs. de Winter. (Emilia Foxs mother Joanna David had the same role in the 1979 Masterpiece Theatre production.) And although not credited, an actress playing Rebecca appears in flashback sequences but never in full profile: we see her hands with bright red nail polish, her lips with bright red lipstick, and the back of her head in the beach house.

Diana Riggs won an Emmy for best supporting actress. She plays the role sympathetically instead of sinisterly and wears an ill-suited wig. The director Jim OBrien has few films to his credit, but he did direct the popular 1984 Jewel in the Crown television series for which Charles Dance and Geraldine James won BAFTA acting awards. The period costumes, the cinematography of Cornwell and environs, and the studio settings of Manderley are stunning.

So lets read (re-read) or view (re-view) a Gothic thriller this summer. May I suggest Rebecca?
I can guarantee an instant chill in the air when the second Mrs. de Winter utters at the beginning of the novel or the film:

Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.
