419866,4,6302036720,"Some of the most interesting horror films come out of the often repeated urban legends that get passed down from one generation to the next.  One of the most popular concerns the one in which a baby alligator gets flushed down a toilet, only to wind up in a sewer and grow to monstrous proportions, gobbling up all those who are foolish enough to climb down a sewer hole.  In ALLIGATOR, director Lewis Teague took this basic idea, wrapped it around some truly cheesy special effects, hired some surprisingly competent actors, and delivered a scare film that is truly enjoyable to watch, even if not for the scare scenes as intended.  Robert Forster is a cynical cop who has lost partners before in his career, so it is difficult for anyone to want to tag along with him on patrol.  He is ordered to investigate a series of underground gruesome killings that he learns is the result of the by now fully grown alligator that has grown to its present size by eating growth hormones that had been dumped illegally in the sewer system by an evil magnate played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger.  It is this infusion of an ecological subtext that imbues ALLIGATOR with a weird blend of a genuine interest in the toxic waste controversy with a series of scenes that come perilously close to self-parody.  Forster is aided by a good-looking herpetologist Robin Riker, who serves as the love interest.  Much of the charm of the film resides in the special effects whose apparent cheapness is either the result of a tight budget or deliberate intent.  The alligator--who by the way is called Ramone only because Miss Riker as a child suffered the trauma of having her father flush down her pet baby alligator of the same name--is seen only either in head or tail profile or in full view but in a way that does not provide a sense of proportion.  Jack Carter plays a mayor whose sliminess is rivaled only by Ramone.  There are a number of interesting cameos by Mike Mazurki (the previous generation's stereotype of a heavy) and Sue Lyon, who twenty years before was Nabokov's Lolita.
Much of the plot of ALLIGATOR comes right out of JAWS.  There is the outsized marine predator killing all who wander into its realm.  Forster is the Roy Scheider cop who has to tangle with the beast.  Robin Riker is the Richard Dreyful marine biologist who provides numerous scientific updates.  Jack Carter is the Murray Hamilton slimeball mayor who fears more about how Ramone will impact on his job than on the safety of his constituents.  And then there is the Hunt for the Beast led by Henry Silva, who takes on the Robert Shaw role.  Still, even knowing all this does not detract too much from what is meant as a scary movie that was designed more to parody true fright than to cause that fright in the first place.  Only the best of the parody scare genre can do this.  ALLIGATOR is one of them.",1042329600,2,2881,4.582846003898635
419867,4,6302036720,"""Alligator"" is a very good little B movie that deserves a much wider audience than it has to date.  I don't even remember it being commercially released; I've caught it several times on late night TV.  But it's a tight, fast-paced, unpretentious film, generally well acted and with a few nifty surprises.  At the start of the movie, a little girl buys a baby alligator from an old Seminole Indian in Florida.  Dad isn't thrilled to have a baby gator in the house, and in a fit of pique one afternoon he flushes it down the toilet.  Down goes the gator into the town's sewer system, which coincidentally is chock full of dead pets, mostly kidnapped cats and dogs, which a villainous vet has been injecting growth hormones into before dumping them into the sewer.  Fast-forward 12 years later; the baby gator, still in the sewer after chowing down on animal cadavers bloated with growth hormones for the past dozen years, has grown into a behemoth with a ravenous appetite and an indiscriminate taste for anything it can chomp on, including humans.  Yuck... body parts start turning up in the city's sewage system, including a couple of sewer workers, a newspaper reporter, and a policeman who went down into the sewer to investigate the shenanigans.  His erstwhile partner, nicely played by Robert Forster, and a young biologist (who else but the little girl now grown up?) team up to try to find out what's going on.  But the alligator is getting kind of bored stuck in the sewer, and one hot night it blasts itself through a concrete sidewalk in the middle of a stickball game, and the chase is on as the gator turns up in dark alleys, a swimming pool, and the town lake, before indecorously crashing the villainous vet's wedding reception and chomping on the guests.  The movie jolts along to a suitably explosive ending and it's great fun from beginning to end.  ""Alligator"" spawned an absolutely dreadful sequel which has nothing to do with the original; the people who made the first ""Alligator"" knew better than to mess with a good thing.  It's a very good, modest, low-budget film that proves again that sometimes small is best after all.",1035763200,15,2145,4.721179624664879

The acting was awful!!!!please don't tell me the actors in this movie even got paid!!!!givin this movie 2 stars is being WAY TOO kind.

I could make a better movie than this,this,this THING!!!!Godzilla looks far more real than the aligator and plus godzilla is much more enjoyable and I don't like godzilla im just comparing them so you know how bad aligator is. Yes it has one good scene that actually made me look at the tv screen was when the aligator was coming out from under the ground and ate the cop. Now let me get to the acting. You know how a robot talks??well think of a robot trying to read a few lines outa a movie script,thats what the charecters sound like.

419882,4,6302036720,"Looking at the scriptwriter alone, it's pretty easy to believe you're going to have a good time with Alligator. John Sayles scripted the genre classic The Howling and the fish spoof Piranha, both respectably low budget and cheesy fun. Here we have the story of a baby alligator being flushed down the toilet, ending up in the infamous New York sewer system, and being exposed to a secret chemical research facility that weasels past the environmental agencies by dumping dead experimented on animals in the sewer. These furry subjects have been doused, injected, and fed growth hormones which, voila!, now make their way into the reptile's system. The reptile promptly grows to monstrous proportions and begins to crave beings bigger than rats. Eventually his scenery grows dull and he breaks through the sewer system in a way that gives cheese a capital C. After he starts chomping down on the clumsy town residents, all hell breaks loose and it's the ultimate big animal monster bash. A stereotypical cop and reptile expert are the ones who try to get in the beast's way. Do they end up killing the creature before it swallows the city?

This movie is one of the better ""there's something in the water"" rip offs. The plot may sound like there's much to be desired but this (thankfully) proves inaccurate. How, you ask? Well for one thing while the gator (Ramon) is in the sewer, there are actually some unsettling moments. It's dark, wet, and closed in. The director attempts tension (or else it's just my phobia coming out) when the gator is creeping up on someone. It's nearly claustrophobic with incredible direction by Lewis Teague. There are some chilling POV shots from the alligators POV, where the victim doesn't know what's sneaking up on him. There's additional goodies of the the camera angled behind the reptile to treat the viewer to a shot of the head swimming the person's way (similar to the top of the shark in Jaws in part 2 when he's about to attack the boat and water skier). Yet another shot is of the victim looking around and becoming frantic. It's all done in a way that's basically seamless, enhancing the production and doing the job that could be performed with a flick of this breed.

Attacks are generally not sudden, with some attempted suspense and build-up; I felt myself growing slightly cold blooded at times. The alligator doesn't immediately fly out of the wall, swallow someone whole, and then disappear again. Well, in the sewer scenes at least....once he erupts into the city things get worse as we speed towards the finale. This was both a plus and a minus. Cheese fans will really dig this part, as it's funnier in a clownish way and there's more victims to be had. Unfortunately the film does have it's faults and they mainly show themselves when Ramon gets greedy and decides to break loose from his underground confinement. In the sewer the dark aided the special effects. (They used a real alligator in many sewer shots) Once its big deformed head erupts through the street, though, it almost resembles an inflatable doll among miniature cars. Ramon never stays the same size, either, as when he bursts through the street he's much larger than he is later walking down the street. (Not to mention how he fits in that swimming pool)

The holes grow and spread as the movie goes on. It should have been easier to find the reptile quicker - I mean, come on, how hard is it to find a huge man-eating gator in New York? And once found why can't they just blow it up and not worry about it?

If you really want to hear more about characters other than Ramon, Robert Forster is well-cast as the cop sporting a hard on for squishing out the cold blooded killer. He's performance was believable enough and he just fit in somehow, although I don't know if it's the greatest compliment to fit so perfectly into a movie of this kind. Other actors certainly need a class or two in their skills; we go from overdramatic to silly, from stale and deadpan, to some generallys***ty dialogue. Scientist Marisa Kendell (Robin Rikey), the other main character, turns out to be the little girl that owned Ramon as a child. But it's never shown in the movie that she learns this, which sucks. I was waiting forever for this mild revelation to come, but alas, she never learned it.

Gore and violence wise, there is a particular scene with a birthday party and a pool and a little kid that sticks with you. The scene where the cops partner was nabbed also sends the blood rushing. Perhaps others wouldn't be bothered by this but with my weariness of gators due to personal experiences, it's not hard to scare the daylights out of me when displaying the creepy things on screen. This movie doesn't skate around political niceties (nice guys are killed, kids are killed)...come to think of it, kids were killed in Piranha too. Guess Sayles doesn't believe in niceties involving the wee ones.

Despite the expected lame effects and inconsistent story dribble, this movie achieves what it sets out to accomplish: it's sheer fun. All ages can gather enjoyment from watching the classic adventures of Ramon, and what better way to warn your children not to toy with wildlife? This movie is one that ages even worse as years wear on because the special effects were null to begin with, but the charm it oozes refuses to be smudged out.",1412640000,,5351,4.699360341151386

All I could remember before this Heaven-sent remastering on DVD was the older print that was shown on USA channel back in the early 90's (but here, it's uncut, commercial free, and more revelatory about its making). The extra featuring John Sayles is a real treasure--this man was a true independent cinema genius (and remains one, actually) and here he speaks of how he wrote ""Alligator"" very quickly and injected ideas into it from his own childhood experiences. I actually think his rushed script for the film ""The Howling"" is rather mediocre, but here his writing is more fresh and more directed. Plus, the great Robert Forster is on board--one of the absolute best of American B-movie actors, ""Alligator"" is another opportunity for him to shine. I am admittedly shocked that no one has tried to remake ""Alligator"" on a bigger scale, and release a glorified remake in 3D into mainstream theaters...but the more I think about it, maybe I don't really want to see that after all!

419900,3,6302036720,"Alligator is one of the best films cut from the ""JAWS"" cloth.  It works the same way the 1978 horror film Piranha works, by not taking itself too seriously and having fun with the material and both were writen by John Sayles.  The DVD has good picture quality with a few interesting extras but it is missing deleted scenes which I know exist.  The extras include the trailer, audio commentary with the film maker and actor Robert Forster, and an interview with writer John Sayles.  When Alligator aired on ABC T.V. back in the early 80's a few outtake scenes were put back in the film to fill in for the gorier scenes which ABC had to trim down.  It's a let down that Loinsgate didn't take the time to put these in the extras.  There are two outtake scenes which I know of for sure.  One scene has the David Madison character going in a phone booth with graffiti of a cartoon alligator eating a person.  The second outtake takes place when the alligator is on the rampage near the end of the movie and goes through a rural neighborhood.  A mother fearing her toddler might be in danger rushes to her back yard where her child was playing only to find that her worst fears are confirmed.  To the mother's horror the back yard is a shambles and the toddler appears to have been taken by the beast, but the toddler reveals herself safely by lifting up a overturned laundry basket she was hidding under.  These missing scenes are the only reason I didn't give this DVD a 4 star rating.

This is one of those guilty pleasure monster movies that's a little cheesy but a lot of fun to watch.  It plays on the whole creepy alligator in the sewer urban myth with convincing performances from all the actors.  If you like ""JAWS"" give this one a try

The urban legend of alligators in the sewers comes to life in this clever creature feature from 1980. Robert Forster stars as David Madison, a streetwise detective who must team up with a lead herpetologist in order to trap the mutant gator before it attacks again. ALLIGATOR uses all of the same devices as JAWS and the other killer animal films of its time, but it does so with its tongue placed firmly in cheek thanks to another sharp script by PIRANHA's John Sayles. It features some astounding special effects and miniature work that are unusual for a film of its size. Ramon is the most convincing giant gator costume in the genre, even beating out more recent additions like ROGUE and LAKE PLACID (as a bit of trivia, Horror fav Kane Hodder played the gator in an uncredited role). Mother nature gets her revenge when Ramon sets his sights on a dinner party that is being held by his ungodly creators. More than anything, the quality of this B-movie is elevated by Lewis Teague's impressive direction, which gives the film a polished appearance. He also takes the opportunity to sneak in several apparent nods to JAWS and other pop-culture references along the way. When it comes to giant gators, ALLIGATOR is king.

419917,5,6302036720,"Alligators and their cousins the crocodiles are popular movie subjects, but so many movies blow the potential. Not Alligator. This aptly-named 1980 flick, now finally released on DVD, is probably not at all what you have in mind when you hear the name. If you're like me, you'll think of cheap special effects, ridiculous deaths and moments where you can clearly see how fake everything is. Not Alligator. You may think of a movie that has one-dimensional characters and situations that are their fault more often than not. Not Alligator.

Detective David Madison and lizard expert Marisa deal with their biggest case as a mysteriously giant alligator in the sewers starts to rear its head, with ensuing body counts. Among the first to go are David's young partner Kelly, making another death on the job he feels guilty about. The public's doubts are diminished when the clues make too much sense for comfort, so the police try to flush the beast out. That's when the fun begins.

Part of what makes Alligator such a good watch is how technically sound it is. You have to remember that this film was made back in 1980, so blood effects weren't the best. That's about it for the technical faults. Nothing looks fake. No biting people in half, none of that incredibly fake stuff. Not at all. The alligator and everything he does looks convincing and believable. Wide shots are aplenty, revealing the gator in all his glory. It's amazing that a 1980 flick about giant reptiles still looks more technically sound than many, more recent examples.

Another big plus is the story. This alligator grows big by feeding off carcasses of lab animals that have been dumped in the sewers after being fed with special testosterone hormones. Believability is thus not an issue. Same goes for human nature. Our hero, David, is brushed off when people ""in charge"" once again fail to listen to the experts. Don't worry, David and Marisa are the best capable at nabbing the beast (unlike that insufferably stupid colonel they somehow elect to catch him). The question is how many victims the gator has claimed before that happens (and sorry folks, he'll take kids if they get in his way). David and Marisa of course have chemistry. There is even a good subplot about Marisa and the gator that sadly never reaches a closure.

Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised. Alligator is that rare thing, a film that manages to be an exciting man-eating alligator flick without compromising story, character or special effects.",1287360000,,2500,4.86150234741784

In a nutshell, this is the Urban Legend about a flushed alligator living in the city sewer system, and while it could be classified as a ""Jaws"" rip-off, or a hold-over from the 1970's Nature-Runs-Amok horror films like ""The Pack"" or ""Day of the Animals"", the crisp writing, the above average acting, and the simply buy effective special effects allows ""Alligator"" to rise above the pack.

The humor found in ""Alligator"" keeps the story from taking itself too seriously, but that's not to say that ""Alligator"" isn't scary. There are some pretty intense scenes early on with several unfortunate cast members stumbling their way into the gator's lair. And one chilling scene involving a little boy dressed as a pirate being forced to ""walk the plank"" by two older kids is especially disturbing.

Like ""Tremors"", ""The Car"", ""Grizzly"" and ""Kingdom of the Spiders"", ""Alligator"" does more within it's meager budget than the limitations of the genre than it has any right to. And like those other B-Movie classics, ""Alligator"" with it's simply effects and effective storyline only gets better year after year when compared to the current crop of CGI riddled horror-fest being produced today.",1275868800,,1326,4.910714285714286

419921,5,6302036720,"Before he wrote and directed such films as EIGHT MEN OUT, MATEWAN, LONE STAR, CITY OF HOPE and BABY IT'S YOU, the extremely talented John Sayles graced us with screenplays for 3 of the most entertaining horror movies of the late 1970's and early 1980's. For director Joe Dante, he penned the delightful PIRANHA (1978), THE HOWLING (1981)- still the best werewolf movie ever made in my opinion, and 1980's ALLIGATOR, for director Lewis Teague.
  Giant 'gator movies come and go, but this is the best one ever made. It has suspense, humor and delightful characters, finely acted by Robert Forster, Robin Riker, Henry Silva and even Dean Jagger, amongst others.

419924,5,6302036720,"Thank goodness this movie is finally available on DVD.  ""Alligator"" is a very good little B movie that deserves a much wider audience than it has to date. I don't even remember it being commercially released; I've caught it several times on late night TV. But it's a tight, fast-paced, unpretentious film, generally well acted and with a few nifty surprises.

At the start of the movie, a little girl buys a baby alligator from an old Seminole Indian in Florida. Dad isn't thrilled to have a baby gator in the house, and in a fit of pique one afternoon he flushes it down the toilet. Down goes the gator into the town's sewer system, which coincidentally is chock full of dead pets, mostly kidnapped cats and dogs, into which a villainous vet has been injecting growth hormones before dumping them into the sewer.

Fast-forward 12 years later; the baby gator, still in the sewer after chowing down on animal cadavers bloated with growth hormones for the past dozen years, has grown into a behemoth with a ravenous appetite and an indiscriminate taste for anything it can chomp on, including humans. Yuck... body parts start turning up in the city's sewage system, including a couple of sewer workers, a newspaper reporter, and a policeman who went down into the sewer to investigate the shenanigans. His erstwhile partner, nicely played by Robert Forster, and a young biologist (who else but the little girl now grown up?) team up to try to find out what's going on.

But the alligator is getting kind of bored stuck in the sewer, and one hot night it blasts itself through a concrete sidewalk in the middle of a stickball game, and the chase is on as the gator turns up in dark alleys, a swimming pool, and the town lake, before indecorously crashing the villainous vet's wedding reception and chowing down on the guests. The movie jolts along to a suitably explosive ending and it's great fun from beginning to end.

""Alligator"" spawned an absolutely dreadful sequel which has nothing to do with the original; the people who made the first ""Alligator"" knew better than to mess with a good thing. It's a very good, modest, low-budget film that proves again that sometimes small is best after all.

419929,4,6302036720,"As the title would suggest, ""Alligator"" (1980) is a ""Jaws"" rip-off nature-runs-amok flick, but ""Alligator"" only plays it semi-serious and is, in fact, a semi-spoof of ""Jaws."" You'll even hear Jaws-imitation suspense music as the creature approaches and attacks.

THE PLOT: A baby alligator is flushed down the toilet and mutates to great size from eating chemically contaminated dog carcasses in the sewers. A policeman and a beautful reptile expert team up to kill the beast after it starts eating people.

""Alligator"" barely runs 90 minutes and is kind of boring for the first half hour, but the last hour perks up and keeps your attention. Unlike ""Jaws,"" which is completely serious and scarey, most adults won't take ""Alligator"" too seriously or find it remotely scarey. In fact, I busted out laughing numerous times when the creature would attack people. Some understandably compare ""Alligator"" to ""Piranha,"" which came out two years earlier in 1978, but ""Piranha"" takes itself a bit more seriously and is more entertaining overall. Actually, as far as creatures-on-the-loose flicks go, ""Piranha"" is a definite 5/5 Star piece.

What makes ""Alligator"" a necessary purchase is the awe-inspiringly gorgeous redhead Robin Riker, who doesn't appear until half an hour into the story. After that she's featured prominently. Robin was 28 years old at the time of release but possesses such a mature and classy air (I mean that in a good way, of course) that she seems at least 35.

Since the last hour of ""Alligator"" is worthwhile and fun I'll rate the story 3.5/5 Stars, even though it can't be taken seriously. Robin Riker, on the other hand, rates 5/5 Stars (actually there aren't enough stars in the universe!); hence, my overall 4/5 Star rating.

Nice dolby 5.1 sound, make Alligator sound in a whole different way on a theatre system. Alligator came out in 1980, during this time the Age Of Gore 1978-1983 was in full swing, so Alligator was one of the gore gems to come out during this Age Of Gore. Alligator was based on urban legend about alligators in the sewar. The year is 1968, and a pet alligator named Ramone gets flushed down the toilet by an angry father. Twelve years later in 1980, this gator has grown to a prehistoric sized 36 foot. Thanks to the gators diet of discarded lab steroid tested animal experiments, it has grown to this enormous size. Alligator writers John Saylesand Frank Perilli and director Lewis Teague makes the viewer aware of the sociol status and economics in society. ex: As you watch this gator wreck havoc through the movie, Ramone( the Gator) starts its havoc in the impoverished neighborhoods and finally action is taken when the gator becomes a problem for the upper class. Robert Forster plays a believable detective David Madison, say what you want about this movie, but Forsters part was played incredibly well. Forsters charachter Detective David Madison was likable, calm collective guy, or a guy who would steal every cent you have. Robert Forster made you believe he was this charachter. Robin Ryker  plays a a belivable herpetologists Dr. Marissa Kendall and an attractive love interest for detective Dave Madison. Apearences by Actors Henry Silva and old time western screen legend Dean Jagger added some interesting charachters to Alligator. One charachter that really brought life to this move was Herpetologists Dr. Marissa Kendalls mother Madeline, actress Patti Jerome. Madeline was a fun interesting charachter that may have annoyed you but your interest was kept, watching actress Patti Jeromes great performance. Great production on the soundtrack by composer Craig Hundly. I thought the soundtrack was great for this kind of movie. A facinating interview with Director Lewis Teague opened new light on this B- film, which I'm happy Lionsgate finally released this cult classic.

419934,4,6302036720,"Alligator is an over the top, ridiculous and fun man vs. beast horror movie.  Think a B-movie version of Jaws if he were on steroids and able to jump out of the water and run through the streets looking for food.  And instead of Roy Scheider as a cop hunting the beast we get Robert Forster as a cop with bad hair hunting a beast in a sewer instead of the ocean.  There is even some Jaws like music with a huge alligator face shadow on the sewer walls approaching instead of a fin rising from the water.

How could this be?  Well from the start we have a family at a zoo watching the alligators and soon after one of the trainers is attacked and mauled by one, our family of course has to buy a baby alligator immediately following this incident and bring it home only to have dad flush it down the toilet alive!

That would be all well and good but there is an evil corporation doing experiments with steroids and growth illegally using local dogs as their test subjects only to dump there steroid filled bodies in, you guessed it, the sewer, which they then become alligator food, duh duh duh!  Hence how as one of the local kids explains the alligator being the size of an El Dorado.  Don't worry animal lovers the director Lewis Teague let's the dog have his day three years later in 1983 when he directs Cujo.

Now our stage is set for our hero cop with baggage and bad hair plugs played by Forester to lead the hunt for the El Dorado sized 20ft alligator with a red haired, green eyed, and sexy local alligator expert.  Oh, and they might just get it on.  And she also may have ties to this particular alligator, I smell a prequel.

For the viewer that likes his horror gory Alligator has significant bright red blood splattered about as the beast chomps away and devours his victims throughout the city neighborhoods and sewers.  The film and the bright blood had a slight look of old school Italian horror to it.  And there also is a plethora of body parts that wash up throughout.  The film albeit the definition of so bad it's good does have it's moments of actual shock, specifically at a Halloween party, where as a joke some older kids make one of there friends walk the plank aka the diving board of there in ground swimming pool, wait!  Is the alligator still in the sewer?

Alligator is great over the top fun and pure entertainment.

Members of this particular acting school, like Kerry Anne, began their celestial rise to stardom by acting in films intended originally for juvenile viewing.

Written by John Sayles, it is almost a re-working of his script for the earlier 'Piranha' (1978, Dir. Joe Dante).

The special effects are WAY above average mixing a real alligator in model sets with a really cool looking full size 'animatronic' alligator which looks great with a full size Henry Silva sliding down it's throat. The acting is consistently good from all the leads and supporting cast (VERY unusual)and many younger viewers may recognise Robert Forster from 'Jackie Brown' in which his male pattern baldness is STILL an issue.

I personally don't own the VHS only the DVD which is now out of print but theres not much diference between the two I don't think. I would tell anybody to forget Lake Placid,Blood Surf,Crocodile and Crocodile 2 forget all that crap and rent Alligator you'll be much happier yeah the special effects arn't great there ok most scenes of the alligator on the street are accualy a model with toy cars and such with a baby alligator running down throught the model but it works so check it out it's well worth it",1078185600,,667,4.138461538461539

CAUTION:  This is not suitable for children (Lots of blood, and close-up scenes of people being ""chomped"" and swallowed)",1519257600,,195,5.290322580645161
7820491,3,6302036720,"The movie is GREAT but this import BluRay is not great quality.  First of all, it's a BURNED DISC BOOTLEG... It does NOT indicate anywhere that it is not a replicated disc, or a professional release.  I honestly think it is either an UPREZ of a Laserdisc or good quality DVD.  There is a lot of artifacting, soft edges and really isn't a true HD 1080p upgrade.  I know there are some legitimate Bluray releases out there, but this isn't it.  I could make out better details on the DVD from lionsgate.  Hopefully it will get a real US release.... so many inferior films have had multiple BluRay releases... but this is a classic and we cannot get a decent release here.  The sound is ""tinny"" and has a ""phasing"" effect, pretty much a guarantee that this release is bogus.  Not the fault of the Seller.",1516060800,,800,4.431506849315069

7820493,5,6302036720,"My favorite alligator on the rampage movie.
A girls pet alligator gets flushed and grows into a huge monster in the sewer, thanks to a steady diet of dead pets experimented on with a growth formula.  People are slow to accept that a monster is living below them.  Eventually, the poor beleaguered creature is forced topside and into the open where it is harassed by the police and a tasty big game hunter.  Why look for snacks when they are delivered with an alarming frequency by a host of faux caterers.

Robert Forster is a hoot as officer Madison, the poor sap no one will believe.  Yes, its an unabashed rip-off of Jaws.  Its supposed to be, thats the whole point.",1509840000,,669,4.487603305785124

7820496,5,6302036720,"One of my favorite 80's movies as a kid. I always liked Forster in his Banyon TV series which only lasted one season and is almost
impossible to find more than the pilot movie and in a TV movie Death Squad which was better than Magnum Force which basically
had the same story line. He has done many other great TV and movies but he really makes this movie better than the script and fun.
The story many already told but the best part is it's just a good classic fun sci fi monster movie even though made in 1980 when the
horror monster films made a comeback. These movies were still good entertainment for all ages but for a decade or more the filth
and over produced CGI and blood and gore and sex has just ruined horror and monster movies. Go back and watch this classic!
Also Alligator II with Joe Bologna is also worth a peak. Not as good as the original but still worth watching.",1500163200,,884,4.236686390532545

So happy to have it. Classic B Movie monster flick. So much fun.",1498867200,,145,4.178571428571429
7820498,4,6302036720,"If you didn't see it in the description, this is an English-language import from Korea. By default, you'll have an English DVD menu, your audio will be in English, and no subtitles (without you choosing to have them, of course).

Don't expect anything spectacular in regards to film and audio quality. I presume that this is a transfer off of some VHS, and it might be your jam if you like to watch these movies as you saw them back in the day. If you have access to an all-region Blu-Ray player and can spring for the Region 2 disc they sell here, it looks like you can upgrade things a little.

I read many reviews here on the site that sum it up better than I ever could, so please read those, but I will say that it's a great Jaws rip-off, and it's a film that knows what it is. Super-good popcorn monster movie. The TLC they put into the look of the titular villain holds up pretty well, too.",1498176000,3,897,4.209302325581396
