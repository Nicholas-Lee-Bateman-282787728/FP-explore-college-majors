8602345,5,B000FIIVV2,"I wasn't sure if it was wise to buy a DVD on MJ gardens.  I had seen a few already, but nothing from SeeMoreBuds.

I am not sure why the other guys didn't like this DVD.  It is actually fantastic for people who learn visually.  The reason I purchase magazines like weed world and cannabis culture is to see gardens and read about the set ups.

This DVD by SeeMoreBuds (VOL2) is exactly that and more.  You actually get to see 6 gardens with meticulous detail.

If you are gonna spend the time, money and effort to grow weed, this is a great place to start.",1199232000,,556,4.188679245283019
8602346,1,B000FIIVV2,"let me start off by saying don't waste your money!!

the six grow rooms were fully mited, amateur sheist! this volume was an utter dissapointment. if you saw the first volume, don't expect a movie anywhere near the same calibre. vol. 1 taught you something you could replicate, as well as watch repeatedly to learn more every time. vol. 2, however, was not tutorial at all. it was simply full of footage of ridiculous grows. nothing was learned from it. what happened, see more buds??",1177632000,2,484,4.694117647058824
