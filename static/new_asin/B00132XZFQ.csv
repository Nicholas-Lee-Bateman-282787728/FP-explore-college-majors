3101477,4,B00132XZFQ,"Having seen the suffering and failures of conventional treatments, I was very interested in this DVD. Mr. Anderson has an axe to grind given family history and at times his biased views takes away from the facts & info presented. He could have shortened the DVD or included different content if he did not spend so much time repeating the same point(s) over and over.
On the other hand, the info and references presented offer an enlightening picture of how the American approach to food and medicine have created a truly dysfunctional health environment.
There are choices in how to prevent cancer and treat it...........the DVD clearly presents them.
As a result, I've picked up a book from one of the guests on he DVD in my own pursuit to improve my diet and cancer fighting strategies.",1229731200,3,789,4.766423357664234
3101478,5,B00132XZFQ,"Healing Cancer from Inside Out is a follow-up to Eating, Mike Anderson's pioneering production that showed the standard American diet as the ""biggest cause of disease, disabilities, and death in the U.S. today."" In this film he is highly critical of the medical profession and its arsenal of toxic chemical treatments for cancer that are doing more harm than good. All the while, doctors are ignoring and even suppressing alternative practices featuring diet and lifestyle changes that have benefited many people.

Sadly, changes will come slowly, if at all, because it is not financially rewarding for doctors to prescribe diet and lifestyle changes to cancer patients. So much money is invested in current chemical and surgical treatments that a large audience for this documentary would create a financial threat to the medical industry, the cancer industry, and the pharmaceutical companies. If people turned to dietary and lifestyle changes instead of the expensive treatments offered today, those industries would be devastated.

Mike Anderson deserves special kudos for his extensive research and his impressive packaging of information. In Healing Cancer from Inside Out he introduces ideas and information that are not welcome on mainstream media but need to be presented to the America public. He has created an enlightening film that will benefit anyone who views it. This film needs NEEDS to be seen.",1220659200,36,1412,5.3558558558558556

The suggestions found in this video are very practical and have a direct and positive impact on both mind and body (as I have personally experienced).

This is a video that I highly recommend for people from all backgrounds and ages.",1215388800,11,381,4.656716417910448
3101480,5,B00132XZFQ,"This powerful documentary contains vital information and perspective that you are unlikely to see otherwise in such a condensed form.  It will help you scrutinize standard representations of effectiveness and side effects. It should inspire you to study the studies before starting any chemo treatment or radiation.

The key premise about conventional treatments is that they are not as effective as commonly represented.  The success statistics are scrutinized by many prominent people in science and medicine, raising important questions.

The key diet premise is that our immune system is very good at killing cancer, if it is strong and healthy.  Our western diseases correlate highly with the big shift in our diets over the last 100 years, from 5% animal products plus 96 whole-plant foods, to our current diet of 42% animal products plus 51% refined foods plus only 7% whole plant foods.

I lost my life partner of 11 years after a three-year battle with breast cancer.  I wish we'd known this information in time to help her. I only found out about it five months after she died.

I've started collecting similar information on this web page:
[...]

A couple caveats about the documentary. It presents things in a relatively black & white manner, with significant moralizing about greed in the medical industry.  True or not, I fear that the tone may turn off some moderates and medical professionals so that they don't hear the bigger powerful messages.  While future videos may be edited to reach a broader audience, I encourage you to look past things that may bother you and be open to the bigger message. I also encourage you to explore some of the studies and quotes by very reputable people that question the degree of progress in the war of cancer.

This documentary is very important for patients, families, medical professionals, and policy makers.  I bought six copies to loan to others.  Get it. Watch it. Pass it on.",1206835200,125,1937,4.938271604938271
3101481,5,B00132XZFQ,"This video is extremely well done, and lays out for the viewer, fact by disturbing fact and interview by inspiring interview, just where much of the blame lies for our skyrocketing national healthcare costs and the corresponding plummeting national health. It pulls no punches when it traces the history of the medical profession and the attendant medical organizations, and their willingness to be more concerned with their own pocketbooks than with the health of the patient.

Too many are willing to submit to the doctor-endorsed ""cure of the day"" without considering the possibility that the ""cure"" may be worse than the illness!  George Washington did just that when he contracted a strep throat, and it cost him his life.  Watch this video, and it may help you avoid making the same error in judgment.  Never be willing to submit yourself to a treatment before checking out ALL of your options!  Make [...] your friend.

Perhaps the one area in this video that may be confusing to people is its implied disapproval of all meat as food, due to the shown increase in cancer risk. This disapproval is no doubt very valid for those currently fighting cancer or other serious health issues, as most meat available today is certainly not what it once was decades ago, and a person ravaged by disease needs to focus on eating the most nutritious, easy to digest foods. But I believe that it is obvious that God created certain animals to be eaten, as the Bible gives us ample examples of this being done.

Jesus himself performed a miracle in which he fed the 5,000 by breaking up a small portion of bread and fish. Many a time a fatted calf was slaughtered to celebrate an occasion in the Bible. The Levi priests, who were in charge of accepting and slaughering meat-offerings to God, were allowed to eat freely of the meat. If meat per se were harmful, I don't think Jesus and the Bible would have given its consumption this stamp of approval. God created us with certain meat-tearing teeth - another sign from our Creator that meat is not off-limits or ill-advised.  But keep in mind that red meat was a rare treat back then, not a daily indulgence.

Perhaps the increase in cancer from eating meat may be related to the way the meat is raised, the way it's prepared, the chemicals it has absorbed (such as antibiotics and fattening hormones), changes in the animals themselves over the centuries, or to the excessive quantity that is eaten. I believe that eating a bit of grass-fed, grass-finished (no grain fattening) omega 3 rich organically raised beef, or a bit of contaminant-free non-bottom-feeding fish now and then would not be harmful.

Also, the ingestion of oils, such as organic virgin olive oil, and certain fats, such as organic virgin coconut oil, are important to good health. A diet where no organic meat/free-range eggs/raw milk or raw cheese are eaten occasionally, and where no added healthy fats or oils are taken, is a diet that will likely not lead to optimum health, in my opinion and in my experience.

But I in no way want to diminish the excellence of this video, as it is indeed a VERY powerful and much-needed film. I plan on buying more copies (quantity discounts are available through Rave Diet) and loaning them out, or giving them as gifts.  An excellent follow-up to this video is the video ""Dying to Have Known,"" which takes things a step further, and is just as captivating as this video (read my review of it on this website).",1205971200,9,3466,4.720198675496689
3101482,5,B00132XZFQ,"Very powerful movie/documentary!!  EVERYONE NEEDS to watch this along with his previous doc ""Eating!""  Much of this info is available if you have the time and energy to read, research, read, research, read... the internet and certain books out there, but most people do not have that luxury these days and this documentary puts much, scattered-in-many-different-areas, information into a very well done video.  I am one of those voracious readers and researchers, but even some of the information he presented was new to me.  Fantastic movie!  Cannot recommend highly enough!!!!

3101483,5,B00132XZFQ,"Another WINNER, from Michael Anderson (Eating-Plus 3rd Edition). 1.3 million Americans will be diagnosed with Cancer, this year! Another 550,500 will die, from it. This extraordinary DVD is timely, well researched and riveting. It will shake the CANCER industry $$$ to it's very foundation! ""Healing Cancer From Inside Out"" will put everything into perspective. You will never fear CANCER again. This is a very powerful and empowering documentary. Find out why 8 out of 10 Oncologists will neither use nor recommend Chemo therapy (a derivative of mustard gas) to family or friends and why many opt for Alternative therapies! Learn how millions are spent annually to suppress alternative therapies and how potential cures were taken off the market. One example is Lane Laboratories. They developed a very effective immune boosting mushroom complex (MGN3). Yet, they were put out of business, by the FDA, when they dared to advertise to the Cancer community! This DVD should be required viewing, by every American man, woman and child. It's an absolute MUST, for every CANCER patient! View it, apply it's wisdom and then share it with family and friends. This DVD is a life saver! Donate a copy to your local library or church organization and help spread the word! CANCER does not have to be a death sentence, ANYMORE! This DVD is proof positive that CANCER is a preventable and reversible disease. There has always been a very powerful and effective cure for Cancer.......it's our immune system! Yet, ALL Cancer therapies suppress the immune system and cause secondary Cancers! Mammograms CAUSE breast Cancer! Shocked? I'm not! Radiation causes Cancer! Before you Walk for the cure, watch this DVD. Get the facts. Cancer is a Multi Billion dollar industry, that relies on fear mongering, toxic drugs, propaganda, spin, counter spin, lies, false hope, misinformation, tons of advertising, skewed studies, celebrity endorsements, government subsidies and the FDA, to enforce its will. At the top of this industry there are the obscenely huge salaries, corporate jets and fancy office towers. At the bottom, there are the well intentioned, good hearted and hard working volunteers. Sadly, there are more organizations PROFITING from this disease, than there are patients! I also recommend: ""A Cancer Battle Plan"", ""Beyond Treason""(DVD) and ""In Lies We Trust""(DVD). Learn how live Cancer viruses are added to common childhood vaccines and how ""AIDs"" was an immune destroying weapon, 15 years in the making, specifically designed for the military and unleashed on the world. Yes! WE literally gave the world......AIDs! There are currently over 800,000 organizations profiting from the AIDSs ""epidemic"". Find a cure? NEVER. For, it's ALL about PROFIT  & unmitigated corporate greed!!! It's up to us, to seek the truth, to empower ourselves, to act and to become a positive force for change!

3101499,5,B00132XZFQ,"While I have never  had cancer, I am interested in prevention.  The documentary affirms that is easier to prevent cancer, heart disease, & diabetes by eating a plant based diet than to reverse it.  The typical western diet plays a major role in the development of cancer.  Animal protein turns on genes that activate cancer growth & can easily be turned off by the elimination of these animal proteins.
Early diagnosis & treatment for cancer does not guarantee a good prognosis.  A healthy immune system fights off bouts of cancer in a person's lifetime about 6 times without them even knowing it. Mike Anderson states that chemo therapy & radiation are poisons that compromise the immune system & will ultimately kill most patients. Chemo might temporarily arrest the cancer, but will not cure it.  The cancer usually returns with a vengeance. Mike Anderson believes that a person will live longer & healthier without conventional treatment.  He further states that cancer has been living in a person's body decades before diagnosis & that a person should not rush into conventional treatment just because his or her doctor recommends they start treatment immediately.  The patient should do research & locate a healing center with good results that advocates a plant based diet & natural supplements.  Should a patient elect to go the conventional route, he or she should become a vegan & juice while undergoing treatment for proper nutrition.
This is a 2 hour video that is a good introduction to this subject & is well worth watching.  This video talks about some of the causes of cancer, the ineffectiveness of conventional treatments & its adverse side effects. This documentary gives some jaw dropping testimonials as to the healing they received due to a change in diet.  This documentary discusses the term ""plant based diet"" without discussing what a healthy plate looks like; therefore, additional resources must be obtained. I would recommend the documentary ""Eating"" as another video to introduce a person to the benefits of becoming a Vegan.",1473724800,3,2055,5.068249258160237

3101551,5,B00132XZFQ,"I am a colon cancer survivor, and I face the threat of esophageal cancer because I have Barrett's Esophagus, a pre-cancerous condition.

I intend to do some more investigation, but this dvd was really eye-opening. I had no idea that allopathic approaches to cancer treatment were so unsuccessful. In my case, it was successful, because the cancer in my colon had not penetrated and had not spread to other organs. Call it a bit of luck to find it so early. In my case, 1/3 of my colon was removed and there was no further trace of it. I can't say I would have opted to treat it entirely by diet, if I had been given that option. I felt that the people in this film were not saying you should never trust an allopathic approach, but be informed and be skeptical. And that's the perspective I have right now because of viewing this dvd. If there is really no important advantage in having chemotherapy or radiation, I don't think I would choose either of them if other cancers are found in my body.

I went totally vegan for 4 or 5 years after I had a cardiac event just shy of a heart attack. I know I can do it again. I don't eat beef or pork at all these days, and just a little chicken breast meat and salmon. I'll take another look at that, to be honest.

I think everyone diagnosed with cancer should have a chance to see this presentation, because it does give you a lot to think about. Just as importantly, it gives you information so you can ask the right questions if chemo or radiation are suggested to you. See if you can get the absolute value of these approaches, not the relative value, which can be very deceptive. I intend to keep this and watch it again, but may pass it on to someone else if the occasion arises.

I have investigated other aspects of alternative medicine, and found a few that I wouldn't endorse, so, even though I was hopeful enough to buy this dvd, I was prepared to be somewhat skeptical. I want to corroborate the statistics quoted in this dvd, but at this point I'm open to being firmly convinced of its value. I was truly shocked by some of the information related, even though I had already learned to be critical of Big Pharma and the FDA, which I view as just a government wing of the drug industry.

This dvd  should be viewed and passed around. Keep an open mind, try to take charge of your own life and health, and learn to ask the right questions of your PCP and those advising chemo. This video will help you in these efforts.",1405123200,2,2474,4.309677419354839

3101599,4,B00132XZFQ,"This is another great DVD by Mike Anderson. The reason why I only gave it four stars though to be honest, is because the first part of this DVD can get pretty boring, as Mike deals with the statistics and numbers behind cancer research, and how they are manipulated by pharmaceutical companies to promote drugs that are largely ineffective and no better than a sugar pill (a placebo). The second part of this DVD though is a gem. People who are in the vanguard of the whole-foods, plant based diet movement, like Dr Colin Campbell, is interviewed extensively and gives you a concise version of the implications of his research, and the protective benefits of a plant based diet. Charlotte Gerson also talks passionately about the short comings of chemotherapy and its dangers, it's always educational to listen to her speak.

Overall, this DVD was enlightening about the vested interest cancer research, and the pharmaceutical industry has in maintaining the myth of the quest for a 'cancer cure'. What this has done is opened up my faculties of commonsense. I work in the drug and alcohol rehabilitation field, and am able to recognize an alcoholic or a methamphetamine user in a mili-micro-second. The physical effects of long-term abuse of such drugs is obvious, so is its effect internally in lab results.

Now even though what a person can eat in a single sitting is rarely as strong as drugs and alcohol are chemically; if you think about what you put into your mouth over the course of a lifetime (if it's the standard Western junk food diet), the effects are just as deleterious, and usually even more so, because what you reap is not only an aesthetically unpleasant looking body, but also an internal system viciously ravaged and prone to cancer.

For me though, the best part of this DVD are the stories of those who've been diagnosed with terminally ill cancer, and have been told by their physician the only thing they can do, is go home and wait for death to come knock at their door, only to adopt a complete change in diet, and beat the cancer and not only survive, but thrive! I never get tired of hearing those stories.

I find it sad, abhorrent and down right unscrupulous that diet itself is not considered a viable avenue by mainstream medicine in its treatment of cancer, and despite such findings being proven via stringent research, it's efficaciousness is overlooked.

It's upsetting to know that it's now common knowledge, people must avoid eating burnt meat because hydrofluoro-carbons and heterocyclic amines are known carcinogens; yet the logical leap hasn't been made, that if putting certain food stuff in your diet can cause cancer, then omitting said stuff, whilst replacing it with whole-plant foods, will not only prevent, but cure cancer, hasn't been made. Why isn't such information taught in medical schools? Why is it doctors can lose their registration and livelihood by making such recommendations?

This is another excellent and thought provoking DVD put out by Mike Anderson, and is something I recommend to anyone who wants to take control of their health destiny, and not be the plaything of 'chance'.",1332806400,4,3146,4.893058161350845

I have critically reviewed it and find the presenters to be highly credible.  The DVD also interviews many experts on the subject and make reference to authors and their books.  Maybe they could've been more forthcoming and provided guidance on where people can go to get these treatments.
 What is needed is a compendium of these proven cures for the people that want it and are willing to go the extra lengths to get it.  Definitely a great resource for people dying of Cancer!
A great opportunity for foreign countries to take this cause, open clinics, and create a niche for some economic gain while offering a valuable service to humanity.
  The treatments are harmless, in contrast to the Holy Trinity remedies of the established medical profession - Surgery, Radiation and Chemotherapy.  I know that if I get cancer or have a family member with cancer, I will definitely consider these treatments.
 Even if , as the medical establishment claims, it is quackery, there is no harm but everything to gain!  Unfortunately, according to the DVD, these natural treatments have been banned in the U.S., with the influence of the AMA (American Medical Association) because the treatments are natural homeopathic cures which cannot be patented.  Therefore the medical industry cannot profit and can stand to lose much from potential lost revenues.  So we are left with few options, among them to go to other countries such as Mexico to the Hoxsey Cancer clinics, the Gerson Cancer clinics, etc.",1297296000,,1639,4.988970588235294

3101615,5,B00132XZFQ,"If Amazon.com would permit it then I would give it all the stars in the Milky Way (0.1 trillion) and more!  It does not surprise me that even when the Truth is available, everyone still ignores it!  Health care now forms the second largest expenditure of our national budget, right behind the defense department.  So one can see how ""ill"" we are as a nation, this despite the soaring costs of latest ""medical advances"" and medication!  When will someone pause for a moment and look for the cause to this paradox?

Maybe, just maybe, that we are looking for a solution to our national health crisis in the wrong place.  Maybe our entire medical establishment has no basis in truth.  Maybe our old folks, and now even the kids are falling ill with diseases that were rare until now, only because the medical mumbo jumbo simply does not work.

This DVD will shake your world just like it did mine.  It will send a tsunami through the world of modern medicine.  In my view ""modern medicine"" is only good for trauma injuries, such as car accidents, industrial work place accidents etc.  When it comes to curing chronic, degenerative and terminal illnesses, it is ineffective.

However, since the medical establishment has all of the US Congress in its back pocket, they are the only players on the block.  If one goes to the grocery store to buy peanut butter, there are 10 different brands to choose from.  If one goes to the car dealer to buy a vehicle, there are six different makes and 50 different models.  If one wants to buy clothing, there are hundreds of different styles and brands.  However, when one wants medical care, it is only one system of medicine -- ""modern medicine"" or allopathy.  It is a dilemma -- ""Take it or die"", and ""Don't take it or die"", because there are simply no alternate systems in practice in the United States.  The American Medical Association (AMA) which was conceived as a Union to protect its turf from the homeopaths, has taken over the entire system of health care.  With the financial clout behind them, they have successfully eliminated all other forms of medicine from the United States.  No one has the courage to stand up to them.

Has it ever occured to you how ineffective is the system of modern medicine?  People take medication for an existing health condition, not for a week, or a month, but for a decade and yet show no improvement!  As if that were not bad enough, their condition deteriorates and manifests in further complications, which require stronger dosages or more powerful drugs.  If the disease does not kill the drugs surely will!  Doesn't anyone pause to think about this fiasco?

When something does not make sense, just follow the money trail.  Why the soaring cost of health care?  Has it ever occured to anyone that the same people who own the insurance companies also own the pharmaceutical companies.  These same people influence the curriculum in medical schools.

If you have someone at home -- mother, father, grand parents, sister or brother -- who is ill from chronic, degenerative or terminal illness, then you owe it to them to buy this DVD and sign up at any of these institutes which successfully cure ""incurable"" cases.  If I had known of the misleading propaganda of the medical establishment through this DVD, then I am certain that my mother, father and sister would still be alive.

I believe that Mike Anderson, the producer of this DVD deserves the ""Medal Of Honor"" -- highest national military honor awarded for gallantry. This production is an act of valor.  In so doing he has taken on the entire medical establishment.  He is courageous like a lion!  Much like Mahatma Gandhi who took on the most powerful empire in the history of the planet, the British Empire.  While Gandhi Ji did not have a single weapon on his side, how was he able to successfully unravel the British empire with its powerful military and navy?  He may have lacked military power, but he lived by the Truth.  Mike Anderson stands on the power of Truth.  So the ""modern medical"" establishment simply does not stand a chance.  Mike, I am right behind you!  I have already purchased over 20 of these DVDs and a dozen of the Eating DVDs.  You can be certain that I will be buying these in the hundreds and distributing to anyone who will watch them.

Additionally I would strongly recommend the following DVDs:

All of the above DVDs will open your eyes to the reality of how grossly negligent we have been in managing our food supply and health care system.  Our people are falling ill and dying like flies, when the cure to their ailments can be found in food!  Unfortunately on account of factory farms taking over our agricutural production, our food supply has been compromised with genetically modified seeds.  Our regulatory agencies such as the USDA, FDA etc that are supposed to watch over our food and medicine has been infilterated at the highest levels by former executives of the big agribusiness, big pharma, fertilizer companies etc.  In order to push their agenda to rake in the dollars, they have set dietary guidelines accordingly and not with our health interests as the sole requirement.  These guidelines, which are stamped on every package of food will if followed, simply kill you!

A good overview of the history, science, and politics of cancer medicine.  Very well documented at every turn.  Includes interviews with several highly respected researchers and practitioners in the field, including Thomas Lodi, M.D., Colin Campbell, PhD, Charlotte Gerson and others.

3101619,5,B00132XZFQ,"I am so happy to have found this video.  My husband has been diagnosed with prostrate cancer.  We had already decided early on that alternative treatment would be a first choice rather then a last choice of treatment.  You have to stop and think and research and not react fast on a decision after the doctors tell you the outcome of testing.  It is proven time and time again by so many people that a lifestyle change of diet, exercise,building the immune system giving our bodies the nutrients it needs and believing that God has given our bodies a miraculous power to heal itself if we eat the right nutrients of fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds, legumes and eliminate animal protein, dairy, eggs and refined sugars. we have been so programmed by the medical association that surgery with devastating removal of body parts and radiation and chemo with horrible, horrible side effects are the only treatments for cancer and all diseases when in fact it is our own misuse of food and lifestyle living that has created the disease inside us. I wonder if doctors know what a lifestyle change is?  I have never had one tell me.  I have learned through my own research and study.  It is time for everyone to take charge of their health.  We need doctors, but not for disease we need them for accidents where our bodies need to be mended back together and for drugs only to treat these emergencies.  We should not have to see a doctor for any other reason if we are feeding our bodies the correct nutrition, exercising and naturally loosing weight as a bonus to a lifestyle change.

3101620,1,B00132XZFQ,I found the DVD extremely biased toward alternative medicine and too anti-medical model.  There is benefit in both.

3101621,5,B00132XZFQ,"First, let me say that this DVD has the same contents with the other one (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Healing-Cancer/dp/B0016K3EMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Healing Cancer</a>), except that this DVD has English (and other languages) subtitles as an extra.

There are two parts to this DVD split into an hour each.

--------------------

The first part talks about the cancer industry and how we have been led to believe that they are actually winning the war against cancer. It elaborates on how the cancer industry manipulates facts and figures to make us think that the conventional cancer treatments are effective, when in fact, they are not.

Here's an example:

In a clinical trial, 100 men take a new drug to see if it can reduce the risk of prostate cancer and another 100 men take a placebo pill.

After five years has passed, results showed that one of the men who took the new drug develop prostate cancer, and two of those taking the placebo pills develop prostate cancer.

Based on these data, which statements below do you think is correct?

1. ""NEW MIRACLE DRUG CUTS PROSTATE CANCER RISK BY 50%!""

2. ""NEW DRUG RESULTS IN 1% DROP IN PROSTATE CANCER RISK!""

The fact is, both statements are correct! These statements represent two different ways to express the data.

The first (1.) statement expresses the relative risk reduction. As only one person who took the new drug develop prostate cancer compared to two who took the placebo pill, that's 50% success rate (1/2).

The second (2.) statement expresses the absolute risk reduction. As only one person (1 out of 100) who took the new drug developed prostate cancer compared to two people who took the placebo pill, the absolute difference is 1% (2% minus 1%).

So, if you are a manufacturer of this new drug, which statement would you prefer to use?

And if you are considering a drug to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, would you be willing to take a drug (especially if it's associated with potentially severe side effects) if it reduced your absolute risk for prostate cancer by just 1%?

--------------------

The second part shows how nutrition can be used to prevent and even reverse cancer as well as other degenerative diseases. It explains how much more effective a healthy diet can be in compared to conventional cancer treatments. It features interviews with T. Colin Campbell (Author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-China-Study-The-Most-Comprehensive-Study-of-Nutrition-Ever-Conducted-and-the-Startling-Implications-for-Diet-Weight-Loss-and-Long-term-Health/dp/1932100660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss and Long-term Health</a>), Charlotte Gerson (Author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Healing-the-Gerson-Way-Defeating-Cancer-and-Other-Chronic-Diseases/dp/0976018608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Healing the Gerson Way: Defeating Cancer and Other Chronic Diseases</a>) and other people who has reversed their cancers using a healthy diet.

I will definitely recommend this documentary DVD to everyone!

If you, your family or friend has been diagnosed with cancer, I hope you or them will find this DVD and the information within useful! Take charge of your health!

We all have a better chance of survival in cancer healing through  natural treatments & plant based diet.

3101625,4,B00132XZFQ,"Although this DVD did disappointment me somewhat in that it had way too many ""written quotes"" through-out it on the screen (it would have benefited more from having these quotes read by someone or having more interviews), it was basically a good video with an important message and some interesting and inspiring people in it, too!

 I loved hearing the message in this DVD: that there are other ways of healing cancer. But the main message is that chemotherapy doesn't work.

I lost my brother last year to cancer and I saw the destructive affect of chemo on his body. It ravaged him and may have been what killed him, rather than the cancer itself. As a result of this, I've determined that chemo will never enter my body if I ever am diagnosed with cancer. Quality of life verse quantity of life is the rule here. Plus, alternative treatment probably has about as much a chance of healing someone of cancer, if not more.

This video reveals the very real deceitfulness of the medical community in their misleading victory statements of how they are ""curing"" cancer. The truth is, there has been little advancement in the cure for cancer in the medical world.

I hope this DVD gets heavy exposure and the word gets out of it's important message! Change is in the air! Hallelujah...we need it!

3101627,5,B00132XZFQ,"I watched the first edition of Healing Cancer from the Inside Out.

After I first watched that 2 hour video, I watched it again about 2-3 times right after that.

I shared it with my cousin, and she bought 10 videos.

Mike Anderson's father died of cancer. He doesn't want to repeat that experience, nor does he want us too. He forcibly examines the cause of cancer, which is diet and lifestyle. The video asks the simple question: what are we doing? Why are we using chemo and radiation, which is outrageously expensive, has a longstanding history of not working, totally looks past the cause, and is poisonous? ""You cannot heal with poison! You cannot heal with poison!"" That quote from Healing Cancer echoed in my mind as I watched the dvd and now has permeated my whole being.

This review cannot fully describe the video's value. It's worth its weight in gold--even if you don't have cancer because you obtain a better view of the reasons why diet and lifestyle is important in anyone of our lives. I'm 25 years old, and I've been a vegan for 6 years and a vegetarian before that. Especially in my more recent years, I've tried to practice a healthier lifestyle. However, I had to see this video.

A list of foods to eat or not, maybe some recipes to look at as a sample and certainly some guidance into what constitutes the plant based diet promoted here. Instead what the DVD is about is the mounting evidence that conventional cancer treatments do more harm than good. The entire DVD is a discussion of why you should not get chemo or radiation and discussions with several people who feel the same way as the author.

One thing I hate more than almost anything else is buying something, then wasting my time to read or listen to it and having that tape or book tell me I need to buy something else to get the real information on the topic. I don't want to discourage people altogether from considering the topic, but skip the DVD. It already tells you what you want to hear. The author website is [...]. I also checked.

chemo and radiation is worse than no treatment at all because it kills the
immune system, which is our only defense in fighting the uncontrolled spread and
mutation of the cancer.  Then he is saying that of all the environmental
and genetic factors that contribute to the spreading cancer, the worst and most
significant is the eating of animal protein and dairy, because it enables
the cancer (it's the fertilizer).  He is also saying that early detection is
a scam, it doesn't make us live any longer if we get cancer, it just lets us
live with the knowledge of the cancer longer.  Finally he is saying that if
we adopt a RAID diet (no refined or processed foods, no animal or dairy products,
no vegetable oils, and regular exercise) we have a shot at - but not a guarantee of -
helping our immune system prevent or kill off a potentially killer cancer.",1250380800,14,1156,4.511961722488039

I literally yelled at different times because the things the author revealed were so true, so shocking, so revealing.  While researching cancer information, I had encountered so many roadblocks, misinformation, just downright lies, and it rocked me to my core to hear my experiences validated in this extraordinary work.  For a while, I wanted to curl up in my bed under the covers and not leave my room, because its so SCARY what is going on in our world, the conspiracies, the greed, the deceptions - but then I became energized and was ready to take action and move forward with not only saving my own life, but saving others.  But people aren't ready to hear the truth, and its sad.  We've become so ingrained with the lies and its hard to pull people into the light, to make them realize that what we've been taught is WRONG, and we CAN indeed not only prevent cancer but CURE cancer ourselves.

I have watched this dvd over and over in the last few days, and now I'm ready to share it with someone else, but I really don't want to let go of my copy!

In this film he is highly critical of the medical profession and its arsenal of toxic chemical treatments for cancer that are doing more harm than good. All the while, doctors are ignoring and even suppressing alternative practices featuring diet and lifestyle changes that have benefited many people.

Sadly, changes will come slowly, if at all, because it is not financially rewarding for doctors to prescribe diet and lifestyle changes to cancer patients. So much money is invested in current chemical and surgical treatments that a large audience for this documentary would create a financial threat to the medical industry, the cancer industry, and the pharmaceutical companies. If people turned to dietary and lifestyle changes instead of the expensive treatments offered today, those industries would be devastated.

Mike Anderson deserves special kudos for his extensive research and his impressive packaging of information. In Healing Cancer from Inside Out he introduces ideas and information that are not welcome on mainstream media but need to be presented to the America public.

3335977,5,B00132XZFQ,"This powerful documentary contains vital information and perspective that you are unlikely to see otherwise in such a condensed form.  It will help you scrutinize standard representations of effectiveness and side effects. It should inspire you to study the studies before starting any chemo treatment or radiation.

The key premise about conventional treatments is that they are not as effective as commonly represented.  The success statistics are scrutinized by many prominent people in science and medicine, raising important questions.

The key diet premise is that our immune system is very good at killing cancer, if it is strong and healthy.  Our western diseases correlate highly with the big shift in our diets over the last 100 years, from 5% animal products plus 96 whole-plant foods, to our current diet of 42% animal products plus 51% refined foods plus only 7% whole plant foods.

I lost my life partner of 11 years after a three-year battle with breast cancer.  I wish we'd known this information in time to help her. I only found out about it five months after she died.

I've started collecting similar information on this web page:
[...]

A couple caveats about the documentary. It presents things in a relatively black & white manner, with significant moralizing about greed in the medical industry.  True or not, I fear that the tone may turn off some moderates and medical professionals so that they don't hear the bigger powerful messages.  While future videos may be edited to reach a broader audience, I encourage you to look past things that may bother you and be open to the bigger message. I also encourage you to explore some of the studies and quotes by very reputable people that question the degree of progress in the war of cancer.

This documentary is very important for patients, families, medical professionals, and policy makers.  I bought six copies to loan to others.  Get it. Watch it. Pass it on.",1206835200,125,1937,4.938271604938271
3335978,5,B00132XZFQ,"This video is extremely well done, and lays out for the viewer, fact by disturbing fact and interview by inspiring interview, just where much of the blame lies for our skyrocketing national healthcare costs and the corresponding plummeting national health. It pulls no punches when it traces the history of the medical profession and the attendant medical organizations, and their willingness to be more concerned with their own pocketbooks than with the health of the patient.

Too many are willing to submit to the doctor-endorsed ""cure of the day"" without considering the possibility that the ""cure"" may be worse than the illness!  George Washington did just that when he contracted a strep throat, and it cost him his life.  Watch this video, and it may help you avoid making the same error in judgment.  Never be willing to submit yourself to a treatment before checking out ALL of your options!  Make [...] your friend.

Perhaps the one area in this video that may be confusing to people is its implied disapproval of all meat as food, due to the shown increase in cancer risk. This disapproval is no doubt very valid for those currently fighting cancer or other serious health issues, as most meat available today is certainly not what it once was decades ago, and a person ravaged by disease needs to focus on eating the most nutritious, easy to digest foods. But I believe that it is obvious that God created certain animals to be eaten, as the Bible gives us ample examples of this being done.

Jesus himself performed a miracle in which he fed the 5,000 by breaking up a small portion of bread and fish. Many a time a fatted calf was slaughtered to celebrate an occasion in the Bible. The Levi priests, who were in charge of accepting and slaughering meat-offerings to God, were allowed to eat freely of the meat. If meat per se were harmful, I don't think Jesus and the Bible would have given its consumption this stamp of approval. God created us with certain meat-tearing teeth - another sign from our Creator that meat is not off-limits or ill-advised.  But keep in mind that red meat was a rare treat back then, not a daily indulgence.

Perhaps the increase in cancer from eating meat may be related to the way the meat is raised, the way it's prepared, the chemicals it has absorbed (such as antibiotics and fattening hormones), changes in the animals themselves over the centuries, or to the excessive quantity that is eaten. I believe that eating a bit of grass-fed, grass-finished (no grain fattening) omega 3 rich organically raised beef, or a bit of contaminant-free non-bottom-feeding fish now and then would not be harmful.

Also, the ingestion of oils, such as organic virgin olive oil, and certain fats, such as organic virgin coconut oil, are important to good health. A diet where no organic meat/free-range eggs/raw milk or raw cheese are eaten occasionally, and where no added healthy fats or oils are taken, is a diet that will likely not lead to optimum health, in my opinion and in my experience.

But I in no way want to diminish the excellence of this video, as it is indeed a VERY powerful and much-needed film. I plan on buying more copies (quantity discounts are available through Rave Diet) and loaning them out, or giving them as gifts.  An excellent follow-up to this video is the video ""Dying to Have Known,"" which takes things a step further, and is just as captivating as this video (read my review of it on this website).",1205971200,9,3466,4.720198675496689

You will never fear CANCER again. This is a very powerful and empowering documentary. Find out why 8 out of 10 Oncologists will neither use nor recommend Chemo therapy (a derivative of mustard gas) to family or friends and why many opt for Alternative therapies!

They developed a very effective immune boosting mushroom complex (MGN3). Yet, they were put out of business, by the FDA, when they dared to advertise to the Cancer community! This DVD should be required viewing, by every American man, woman and child. It's an absolute MUST, for every CANCER patient! View it, apply it's wisdom and then share it with family and friends. This DVD is a life saver! Donate a copy to your local library or church organization and help spread the word! CANCER does not have to be a death sentence, ANYMORE! This DVD is proof positive that CANCER is a preventable and reversible disease. There has always been a very powerful and effective cure for Cancer.......it's our immune system! Yet, ALL Cancer therapies suppress the immune system and cause secondary Cancers! Mammograms CAUSE breast Cancer! Shocked? I'm not! Radiation causes Cancer!

Cancer is a Multi Billion dollar industry, that relies on fear mongering, toxic drugs, propaganda, spin, counter spin, lies, false hope, misinformation, tons of advertising, skewed studies, celebrity endorsements, government subsidies and the FDA, to enforce its will. At the top of this industry there are the obscenely huge salaries, corporate jets and fancy office towers. At the bottom, there are the well intentioned, good hearted and hard working volunteers. Sadly, there are more organizations PROFITING from this disease, than there are patients! I also recommend: ""A Cancer Battle Plan"", ""Beyond Treason""(DVD) and ""In Lies We Trust""(DVD). Learn how live Cancer viruses are added to common childhood vaccines and how ""AIDs"" was an immune destroying weapon, 15 years in the making, specifically designed for the military and unleashed on the world. Yes! WE literally gave the world......AIDs! There are currently over 800,000 organizations profiting from the AIDSs ""epidemic"". Find a cure? NEVER.

3335996,5,B00132XZFQ,"While I have never  had cancer, I am interested in prevention.  The documentary affirms that is easier to prevent cancer, heart disease, & diabetes by eating a plant based diet than to reverse it.  The typical western diet plays a major role in the development of cancer.  Animal protein turns on genes that activate cancer growth & can easily be turned off by the elimination of these animal proteins.
Early diagnosis & treatment for cancer does not guarantee a good prognosis.  A healthy immune system fights off bouts of cancer in a person's lifetime about 6 times without them even knowing it. Mike Anderson states that chemo therapy & radiation are poisons that compromise the immune system & will ultimately kill most patients. Chemo might temporarily arrest the cancer, but will not cure it.  The cancer usually returns with a vengeance. Mike Anderson believes that a person will live longer & healthier without conventional treatment.  He further states that cancer has been living in a person's body decades before diagnosis & that a person should not rush into conventional treatment just because his or her doctor recommends they start treatment immediately.  The patient should do research & locate a healing center with good results that advocates a plant based diet & natural supplements.  Should a patient elect to go the conventional route, he or she should become a vegan & juice while undergoing treatment for proper nutrition.
This is a 2 hour video that is a good introduction to this subject & is well worth watching.  This video talks about some of the causes of cancer, the ineffectiveness of conventional treatments & its adverse side effects. This documentary gives some jaw dropping testimonials as to the healing they received due to a change in diet.  This documentary discusses the term ""plant based diet"" without discussing what a healthy plate looks like; therefore, additional resources must be obtained.

3336048,5,B00132XZFQ,"I am a colon cancer survivor, and I face the threat of esophageal cancer because I have Barrett's Esophagus, a pre-cancerous condition.

I intend to do some more investigation, but this dvd was really eye-opening. I had no idea that allopathic approaches to cancer treatment were so unsuccessful. In my case, it was successful, because the cancer in my colon had not penetrated and had not spread to other organs. Call it a bit of luck to find it so early. In my case, 1/3 of my colon was removed and there was no further trace of it. I can't say I would have opted to treat it entirely by diet, if I had been given that option. I felt that the people in this film were not saying you should never trust an allopathic approach, but be informed and be skeptical. And that's the perspective I have right now because of viewing this dvd. If there is really no important advantage in having chemotherapy or radiation, I don't think I would choose either of them if other cancers are found in my body.

I went totally vegan for 4 or 5 years after I had a cardiac event just shy of a heart attack. I know I can do it again. I don't eat beef or pork at all these days, and just a little chicken breast meat and salmon. I'll take another look at that, to be honest.

I think everyone diagnosed with cancer should have a chance to see this presentation, because it does give you a lot to think about. Just as importantly, it gives you information so you can ask the right questions if chemo or radiation are suggested to you. See if you can get the absolute value of these approaches, not the relative value, which can be very deceptive. I intend to keep this and watch it again, but may pass it on to someone else if the occasion arises.

I have investigated other aspects of alternative medicine, and found a few that I wouldn't endorse, so, even though I was hopeful enough to buy this dvd, I was prepared to be somewhat skeptical. I want to corroborate the statistics quoted in this dvd, but at this point I'm open to being firmly convinced of its value. I was truly shocked by some of the information related, even though I had already learned to be critical of Big Pharma and the FDA, which I view as just a government wing of the drug industry.

This dvd  should be viewed and passed around. Keep an open mind, try to take charge of your own life and health, and learn to ask the right questions of your PCP and those advising chemo. This video will help you in these efforts.",1405123200,2,2474,4.309677419354839

The information presented in this dvd helps us learn and understand that there are other ways to help the body heal, and with less harm. We have watched multiple times and are sharing it with friends and family who want to know the truth. I think I am building a ""lending library"" of materials that I can share with others and this is definitely in it!",1338768000,,689,4.609756097560975

3336096,4,B00132XZFQ,"This is another great DVD by Mike Anderson. The reason why I only gave it four stars though to be honest, is because the first part of this DVD can get pretty boring, as Mike deals with the statistics and numbers behind cancer research, and how they are manipulated by pharmaceutical companies to promote drugs that are largely ineffective and no better than a sugar pill (a placebo). The second part of this DVD though is a gem. People who are in the vanguard of the whole-foods, plant based diet movement, like Dr Colin Campbell, is interviewed extensively and gives you a concise version of the implications of his research, and the protective benefits of a plant based diet. Charlotte Gerson also talks passionately about the short comings of chemotherapy and its dangers, it's always educational to listen to her speak.

Overall, this DVD was enlightening about the vested interest cancer research, and the pharmaceutical industry has in maintaining the myth of the quest for a 'cancer cure'. What this has done is opened up my faculties of commonsense. I work in the drug and alcohol rehabilitation field, and am able to recognize an alcoholic or a methamphetamine user in a mili-micro-second. The physical effects of long-term abuse of such drugs is obvious, so is its effect internally in lab results.

Now even though what a person can eat in a single sitting is rarely as strong as drugs and alcohol are chemically; if you think about what you put into your mouth over the course of a lifetime (if it's the standard Western junk food diet), the effects are just as deleterious, and usually even more so, because what you reap is not only an aesthetically unpleasant looking body, but also an internal system viciously ravaged and prone to cancer.

For me though, the best part of this DVD are the stories of those who've been diagnosed with terminally ill cancer, and have been told by their physician the only thing they can do, is go home and wait for death to come knock at their door, only to adopt a complete change in diet, and beat the cancer and not only survive, but thrive! I never get tired of hearing those stories.

I find it sad, abhorrent and down right unscrupulous that diet itself is not considered a viable avenue by mainstream medicine in its treatment of cancer, and despite such findings being proven via stringent research, it's efficaciousness is overlooked.

It's upsetting to know that it's now common knowledge, people must avoid eating burnt meat because hydrofluoro-carbons and heterocyclic amines are known carcinogens; yet the logical leap hasn't been made, that if putting certain food stuff in your diet can cause cancer, then omitting said stuff, whilst replacing it with whole-plant foods, will not only prevent, but cure cancer, hasn't been made. Why isn't such information taught in medical schools? Why is it doctors can lose their registration and livelihood by making such recommendations?

This is another excellent and thought provoking DVD put out by Mike Anderson, and is something I recommend to anyone who wants to take control of their health destiny, and not be the plaything of 'chance'.",1332806400,4,3146,4.893058161350845

Cancer is a poison inside your body. Chemotherapy or radiation is poison too.
You cannot treat poison with poison.

I have critically reviewed it and find the presenters to be highly credible.  The DVD also interviews many experts on the subject and make reference to authors and their books.  Maybe they could've been more forthcoming and provided guidance on where people can go to get these treatments.
 What is needed is a compendium of these proven cures for the people that want it and are willing to go the extra lengths to get it.  Definitely a great resource for people dying of Cancer!
A great opportunity for foreign countries to take this cause, open clinics, and create a niche for some economic gain while offering a valuable service to humanity.
  The treatments are harmless, in contrast to the Holy Trinity remedies of the established medical profession - Surgery, Radiation and Chemotherapy.  I know that if I get cancer or have a family member with cancer, I will definitely consider these treatments.
 Even if , as the medical establishment claims, it is quackery, there is no harm but everything to gain!  Unfortunately, according to the DVD, these natural treatments have been banned in the U.S., with the influence of the AMA (American Medical Association) because the treatments are natural homeopathic cures which cannot be patented.  Therefore the medical industry cannot profit and can stand to lose much from potential lost revenues.  So we are left with few options, among them to go to other countries such as Mexico to the Hoxsey Cancer clinics, the Gerson Cancer clinics, etc.",1297296000,,1639,4.988970588235294

It does not surprise me that even when the Truth is available, everyone still ignores it!  Health care now forms the second largest expenditure of our national budget, right behind the defense department.  So one can see how ""ill"" we are as a nation, this despite the soaring costs of latest ""medical advances"" and medication!  When will someone pause for a moment and look for the cause to this paradox?

Maybe, just maybe, that we are looking for a solution to our national health crisis in the wrong place.  Maybe our entire medical establishment has no basis in truth.  Maybe our old folks, and now even the kids are falling ill with diseases that were rare until now, only because the medical mumbo jumbo simply does not work.

This DVD will shake your world just like it did mine.  It will send a tsunami through the world of modern medicine.  In my view ""modern medicine"" is only good for trauma injuries, such as car accidents, industrial work place accidents etc.  When it comes to curing chronic, degenerative and terminal illnesses, it is ineffective.

However, since the medical establishment has all of the US Congress in its back pocket, they are the only players on the block.  If one goes to the grocery store to buy peanut butter, there are 10 different brands to choose from.  If one goes to the car dealer to buy a vehicle, there are six different makes and 50 different models.  If one wants to buy clothing, there are hundreds of different styles and brands.  However, when one wants medical care, it is only one system of medicine -- ""modern medicine"" or allopathy.  It is a dilemma -- ""Take it or die"", and ""Don't take it or die"", because there are simply no alternate systems in practice in the United States.  The American Medical Association (AMA) which was conceived as a Union to protect its turf from the homeopaths, has taken over the entire system of health care.  With the financial clout behind them, they have successfully eliminated all other forms of medicine from the United States.  No one has the courage to stand up to them.

Has it ever occured to you how ineffective is the system of modern medicine?  People take medication for an existing health condition, not for a week, or a month, but for a decade and yet show no improvement!  As if that were not bad enough, their condition deteriorates and manifests in further complications, which require stronger dosages or more powerful drugs.  If the disease does not kill the drugs surely will!  Doesn't anyone pause to think about this fiasco?

When something does not make sense, just follow the money trail.  Why the soaring cost of health care?  Has it ever occured to anyone that the same people who own the insurance companies also own the pharmaceutical companies.  These same people influence the curriculum in medical schools.

If you have someone at home -- mother, father, grand parents, sister or brother -- who is ill from chronic, degenerative or terminal illness, then you owe it to them to buy this DVD and sign up at any of these institutes which successfully cure ""incurable"" cases.  If I had known of the misleading propaganda of the medical establishment through this DVD, then I am certain that my mother, father and sister would still be alive.

I believe that Mike Anderson, the producer of this DVD deserves the ""Medal Of Honor"" -- highest national military honor awarded for gallantry. This production is an act of valor.  In so doing he has taken on the entire medical establishment.  He is courageous like a lion!  Much like Mahatma Gandhi who took on the most powerful empire in the history of the planet, the British Empire.  While Gandhi Ji did not have a single weapon on his side, how was he able to successfully unravel the British empire with its powerful military and navy?  He may have lacked military power, but he lived by the Truth.  Mike Anderson stands on the power of Truth.  So the ""modern medical"" establishment simply does not stand a chance.  Mike, I am right behind you!  I have already purchased over 20 of these DVDs and a dozen of the Eating DVDs.  You can be certain that I will be buying these in the hundreds and distributing to anyone who will watch them.

All of the above DVDs will open your eyes to the reality of how grossly negligent we have been in managing our food supply and health care system.  Our people are falling ill and dying like flies, when the cure to their ailments can be found in food!  Unfortunately on account of factory farms taking over our agricutural production, our food supply has been compromised with genetically modified seeds.  Our regulatory agencies such as the USDA, FDA etc that are supposed to watch over our food and medicine has been infilterated at the highest levels by former executives of the big agribusiness, big pharma, fertilizer companies etc.  In order to push their agenda to rake in the dollars, they have set dietary guidelines accordingly and not with our health interests as the sole requirement.  These guidelines, which are stamped on every package of food will if followed, simply kill you!

We had already decided early on that alternative treatment would be a first choice rather then a last choice of treatment.  You have to stop and think and research and not react fast on a decision after the doctors tell you the outcome of testing.  It is proven time and time again by so many people that a lifestyle change of diet, exercise,building the immune system giving our bodies the nutrients it needs and believing that God has given our bodies a miraculous power to heal itself if we eat the right nutrients of fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds, legumes and eliminate animal protein, dairy, eggs and refined sugars. we have been so programmed by the medical association that surgery with devastating removal of body parts and radiation and chemo with horrible, horrible side effects are the only treatments for cancer and all diseases when in fact it is our own misuse of food and lifestyle living that has created the disease inside us. I wonder if doctors know what a lifestyle change is?  I have never had one tell me.  I have learned through my own research and study.  It is time for everyone to take charge of their health.  We need doctors, but not for disease we need them for accidents where our bodies need to be mended back together and for drugs only to treat these emergencies.  We should not have to see a doctor for any other reason if we are feeding our bodies the correct nutrition, exercising and naturally loosing weight as a bonus to a lifestyle change.

There are two parts to this DVD split into an hour each.

--------------------

The first part talks about the cancer industry and how we have been led to believe that they are actually winning the war against cancer. It elaborates on how the cancer industry manipulates facts and figures to make us think that the conventional cancer treatments are effective, when in fact, they are not.

Here's an example:

In a clinical trial, 100 men take a new drug to see if it can reduce the risk of prostate cancer and another 100 men take a placebo pill.

After five years has passed, results showed that one of the men who took the new drug develop prostate cancer, and two of those taking the placebo pills develop prostate cancer.

Based on these data, which statements below do you think is correct?

1. ""NEW MIRACLE DRUG CUTS PROSTATE CANCER RISK BY 50%!""

2. ""NEW DRUG RESULTS IN 1% DROP IN PROSTATE CANCER RISK!""

The fact is, both statements are correct! These statements represent two different ways to express the data.

The first (1.) statement expresses the relative risk reduction. As only one person who took the new drug develop prostate cancer compared to two who took the placebo pill, that's 50% success rate (1/2).

The second (2.) statement expresses the absolute risk reduction. As only one person (1 out of 100) who took the new drug developed prostate cancer compared to two people who took the placebo pill, the absolute difference is 1% (2% minus 1%).

So, if you are a manufacturer of this new drug, which statement would you prefer to use?

And if you are considering a drug to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, would you be willing to take a drug (especially if it's associated with potentially severe side effects) if it reduced your absolute risk for prostate cancer by just 1%?

--------------------

The second part shows how nutrition can be used to prevent and even reverse cancer as well as other degenerative diseases. It explains how much more effective a healthy diet can be in compared to conventional cancer treatments. It features interviews with T. Colin Campbell (Author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-China-Study-The-Most-Comprehensive-Study-of-Nutrition-Ever-Conducted-and-the-Startling-Implications-for-Diet-Weight-Loss-and-Long-term-Health/dp/1932100660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss and Long-term Health</a>), Charlotte Gerson (Author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Healing-the-Gerson-Way-Defeating-Cancer-and-Other-Chronic-Diseases/dp/0976018608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Healing the Gerson Way: Defeating Cancer and Other Chronic Diseases</a>) and other people who has reversed their cancers using a healthy diet.

The pharmaceutical companies & AMA would NOT want you to watch this DVD, because it would expose them! They would lose ALOT of money if people all turned to natural treatments.  We all have a better chance of survival in cancer healing through  natural treatments & plant based diet.

It is very anti-chemo.  If someone has not tried chemo yet, this may be helpful, but for those of us who have chosen the chemo route, it was very scarey and borderline insulting in regards to the choices we have made.

 I loved hearing the message in this DVD: that there are other ways of healing cancer. But the main message is that chemotherapy doesn't work.

I lost my brother last year to cancer and I saw the destructive affect of chemo on his body. It ravaged him and may have been what killed him, rather than the cancer itself. As a result of this, I've determined that chemo will never enter my body if I ever am diagnosed with cancer. Quality of life verse quantity of life is the rule here. Plus, alternative treatment probably has about as much a chance of healing someone of cancer, if not more.

This video reveals the very real deceitfulness of the medical community in their misleading victory statements of how they are ""curing"" cancer. The truth is, there has been little advancement in the cure for cancer in the medical world.

I hope this DVD gets heavy exposure and the word gets out of it's important message! Change is in the air! Hallelujah...we need it!

3336124,5,B00132XZFQ,"I watched the first edition of Healing Cancer from the Inside Out.

After I first watched that 2 hour video, I watched it again about 2-3 times right after that.

I shared it with my cousin, and she bought 10 videos.

Mike Anderson's father died of cancer. He doesn't want to repeat that experience, nor does he want us too. He forcibly examines the cause of cancer, which is diet and lifestyle. The video asks the simple question: what are we doing? Why are we using chemo and radiation, which is outrageously expensive, has a longstanding history of not working, totally looks past the cause, and is poisonous? ""You cannot heal with poison! You cannot heal with poison!"" That quote from Healing Cancer echoed in my mind as I watched the dvd and now has permeated my whole being.

This review cannot fully describe the video's value. It's worth its weight in gold--even if you don't have cancer because you obtain a better view of the reasons why diet and lifestyle is important in anyone of our lives. I'm 25 years old, and I've been a vegan for 6 years and a vegetarian before that. Especially in my more recent years, I've tried to practice a healthier lifestyle. However, I had to see this video.

You just need to buy this video from Amazon.

After you watch it, you'll want to buy even more copies for your friends and family!

I already beleive in diet as a way to help cure some and possibly more than some diseases including cancer. What I was looking for was some detail on the how to. A list of foods to eat or not, maybe some recipes to look at as a sample and certainly some guidance into what constitutes the plant based diet promoted here. Instead what the DVD is about is the mounting evidence that conventional cancer treatments do more harm than good. The entire DVD is a discussion of why you should not get chemo or radiation and discussions with several people who feel the same way as the author.

One thing I hate more than almost anything else is buying something, then wasting my time to read or listen to it and having that tape or book tell me I need to buy something else to get the real information on the topic. I don't want to discourage people altogether from considering the topic, but skip the DVD. It already tells you what you want to hear. The author website is [...]. I also checked.

This is more of a nutritional and holistic approach to tackling this problem which to me makes more sense and i have seen the benefits of this approach with a friend of mine.

3336130,4,B00132XZFQ,"Having watched the DVD today the feeling I'm left with is that this is a
disturbing premise.  Mike is basically saying that we all have cancer and
that it becomes a problem when our immune system stops identifying and killing
the cancer cells we all have.  Further he is saying that 98% of all cancer
chemo and radiation is worse than no treatment at all because it kills the
immune system, which is our only defense in fighting the uncontrolled spread and
mutation of the cancer.  Then he is saying that of all the environmental
and genetic factors that contribute to the spreading cancer, the worst and most
significant is the eating of animal protein and dairy, because it enables
the cancer (it's the fertilizer).  He is also saying that early detection is
a scam, it doesn't make us live any longer if we get cancer, it just lets us
live with the knowledge of the cancer longer.  Finally he is saying that if
we adopt a RAID diet (no refined or processed foods, no animal or dairy products,
no vegetable oils, and regular exercise) we have a shot at - but not a guarantee of -
helping our immune system prevent or kill off a potentially killer cancer.",1250380800,14,1156,4.511961722488039

In this DVD you will learn about foods and find out that we (U.S.A.) as a culture have become like sheep to the slaughter. We beleive what the doctors tell us. Why? Because we're not taking personal responsibility for our lives. We want to believe. We want to believe that others, especially DOCTORS wouldn't lie to us.

I literally yelled at different times because the things the author revealed were so true, so shocking, so revealing.  While researching cancer information, I had encountered so many roadblocks, misinformation, just downright lies, and it rocked me to my core to hear my experiences validated in this extraordinary work.  For a while, I wanted to curl up in my bed under the covers and not leave my room, because its so SCARY what is going on in our world, the conspiracies, the greed, the deceptions - but then I became energized and was ready to take action and move forward with not only saving my own life, but saving others.  But people aren't ready to hear the truth, and its sad.  We've become so ingrained with the lies and its hard to pull people into the light, to make them realize that what we've been taught is WRONG, and we CAN indeed not only prevent cancer but CURE cancer ourselves.

I have watched this dvd over and over in the last few days, and now I'm ready to share it with someone else, but I really don't want to let go of my copy!
