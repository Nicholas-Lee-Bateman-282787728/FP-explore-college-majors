8722357,4,B010G4FGEE,"Makes one really wonder about this event and what it is for or who it is for.
The best part of the movie was hearing about White House Correspondents and what it's really like to work in the White House.",1488758400,,203,4.1
8722358,5,B010G4FGEE,"Fascinating and thought provoking film that exposes the ugly truth behind Washington's biggest week. At it's core is the troubling realization that if journalists continue to get shunned for hollywood types and lobbyist, who will ultimately hold Washington accountable for what really matters?? Great documentary in the sprit of what our government needs to get back to...public service!",1438214400,,387,5.689655172413793
8722359,5,B010G4FGEE,"Patrick's expose on the Nerd Prom is not only eye-opening, but also thought-provoking. The extent to which the original intent of the Correspondents dinner has drastically shifted from journalism to glitz and glamor mirrors a similar shift in politics. After watching Nerd Prom, I got wondering about all the other traditions that we should be questioning in Washington. Thank you for bringing to light the realities of Washington.",1438128000,,431,5.352941176470588
8722360,5,B010G4FGEE,"So many people don't understand what this weekend is really all about--and Patrick does an excellent job at explaining just that. From the history of the dinner to who really runs the organization and the tickets, it will be enjoyed by those both inside and outside the Beltway.

8722363,5,B010G4FGEE,Patrick Gavin turns an insider's critical eye towards Washington DC's biggest and most glittering weekend. This is supposed to be a serious city  the world's most powerful  but Washington's White House Correspondents weekend seems to devolve into a reality stars' beauty contest with Washington power players aiding and abetting.  Gavin's take is brave and admirable.,1438041600,,367,5.636363636363637
