8176880,1,B000NDEWGW,"This was even worse than the first season.  What happened, did your camera man find another job and take his camera with him?  And you can't even afford a DVD case to send this in?  I got this in two blank jewel-cases and the title was hand-written on the DVD in marker!

Chris, just admit it, you have no talent, that's probably why you dropped out of film school.  Go do something else with your life other than pretending you can act.",1279152000,12,437,4.280487804878049
8176881,1,B000NDEWGW,"This product has a lot of quality and it's all low. For the price of this you could get 3 buckets of chocolate ice cream from a grocery store, eating the ice cream would be more enjoyable, and it would take longer to eat it than it does to watch this DVD. Additionally, if you gained some extra weight and want to remove it, you can just go to the gym, but the time wasted on this DVD cannot be recovered.",1270425600,16,405,4.012345679012346
8176882,5,B000NDEWGW,"Although they should be DVD's and not DVDR's the content is what matters.  Haunted Investigators is a truly great show, why watch TV when you have Irate Gamer, HI, AVGN and so much better stuff on the internet and DVD.  The show provides great suspense, scares, cool unique locations and great commentary.  Thumbs up.",1269388800,,317,4.833333333333333
8176883,1,B000NDEWGW,This show is not the quality of other more famous shows available on DVD. The DVDs are poor quality DVD-Rs (burned discs) in cheap thin packs with copied inserts. I purchased this show and it didn't work on my Sony 200 disc DVD player because it was a DVDR - I had to return it to Amazon. [...]. People who are thinking about purchasing this series should know that it is not as good as others out there. Save your money.,1235779200,14,421,4.209876543209877
