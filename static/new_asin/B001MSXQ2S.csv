8321754,5,B001MSXQ2S,This is a great DVD!  DC Curry is one of our greatest comedians. If he is in your city go and see him you will not be disappointed!,1402790400,,131,3.6785714285714284
8321755,2,B001MSXQ2S,"It's a gospel play. Had I known that I would have run. But, noooo. I bought it just on the strength of Don 'DC' Curry. He only did commentaries from the sidelines. The story was not worth the time it took to watch. People please spare us. If you have nothing to say, don't do these 'gospel' plays. And if you're going to do them, learn your craft. There is a way to tell a story. There is a way to get your message across. This ain't it.",1397692800,,437,3.977272727272727
8321756,3,B001MSXQ2S,"is one of the most funniest comedians out there, but this movie was so and did not do it for me.",1374537600,,96,3.619047619047619
8321757,3,B001MSXQ2S,"I searched comedy skits on You Tube one day and was re-acquainted with DC Curry who I think is a top comedian! That prompted me to buy this dvd. I must have mis-read the description because I was surprised that it is a stage play instead of one of DC's stage performances. This play is like the ones often performed in small urban theatres - small budgets, small casts and generally based on everyday lives of African-American families - highlighted by the church and the community. I rate the play as ""ok"".",1355875200,,507,4.521739130434782
8321758,2,B001MSXQ2S,"I would not suggest that you actually buy this Play if you love to watch Plays. This is not one that you would watch again and again. Although Mr. Curry is normally funny-he does not play an old fart too well. The entire play drags and you find yourself looking for anything funny to happen. Rent or borrow it if reading the story line entrigues you, just don't buy it.",1329091200,,369,4.285714285714286
8321759,5,B001MSXQ2S,"The DVD was advertised as like new, used only once.  It was in excellent condition when received (very fast shipment, too).

Very Satisfied",1278979200,,139,5.0
