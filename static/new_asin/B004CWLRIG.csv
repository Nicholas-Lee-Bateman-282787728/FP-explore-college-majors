4329265,5,B004CWLRIG,I thought this dvd was relaxing and funny to watch.  The actors was superb .... giving us a sense of so many disasters that could happen before a wedding.  I for one think that it is a good idea to clear the slate before committing to a life time partner.,1306022400,3,255,4.08
4329266,5,B004CWLRIG,"This was a great movies. Never heard of it until I scrolled thru Amazon's list of Black movies. I enjoyed all of it, nothing wrong; no overplayed roles.

The movie showed how 2 people can love in truth and in honest.  When you are in love, it does not pay to bring old baggage and past mistakes into a new marriage in 'SECRET'.

You must tell of all your baggage that you know will cause a problem with your new spouse, especially if it had something to do with a close friend of your spouse. You can't keep that a secret because one day, it will slip out. The bridegroom's secret ate him up inside all the way to the altar saying his I DOs before he had the nerve to tell his bride-to-be, his secret.

For a while it looked like no wedding was going to take place, but his love for her, prayer, explanations of what happened, and the pastor praying with both of them, brought them through.  Forgiveness is powerful and healing only if you have the GUTS to CONFESS YOUR SINS, AND THE GUTS TO FORGIVE A LOVE ONE.

Many forget that ""what is done in the dark will come to the light'. God promised that and it will happen, so if you don't want to destroy your relationships or marriages, tell it all. Especially, if it involves many men or women, or a best friend. Those kinds of situations are too close not to tell.

Even if you men had a lot of women, you still need to confess that, even without calling names, unless it is someone who you are still friends with now. That has to stop.  Same with you women. SO, LETS ALL BE GUILT FREE IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND BE FREE TO HAVE AND LIVE A WONDERFUL LOVE FILLED LIFE.

I can't believe I saw this great movie for $1.99.  Beats Comcast any day.
I love Amazon's new Instant Video. I've seen so many movies that I never heard of.

THANKS AMAZON. I'M HOOKED ON YOU!!! LOL",1302825600,11,1813,4.210982658959537

I have to admit I was going to turn this off half way through but I wanted to wait and see what the big ""secret"" was. And although the acting was mediocre, I actually shed a tear at the end! I love stories of redemption and the power of Gods grace & love, and this one turned out to be just that.

It brought tears to my eyes and a smile to my face. From beginning to end I was completely into it. Tyler Perry struck a home run with this movie. Not a big fan of the Madea movies, but his real movies, the ones about life, love, and relationships always hit home. I just cannot begin to explain how much I loved this movie. You really need to watch it, especially if you are getting married soon. This movie teachers forgiveness and shows that true love does exist and that even if it feels like there is no silver lining to your life, just open up your heart and it will be there.",1442448000,4,735,4.294964028776978

This non-taxing light romantic comedy has a black middle class couple with the usual assortment of bridesmaids and groomsmen who support them tying the knot.  The Christian approach to problem solving, forgiveness and marriage is believable and appropriate in this circumstance.  If one doesn't follow that faith, the story will still cause one to ask, what would be my moral approach to resolving the situation.

Nice to see a romantic love story where adults of all ages are in love and can express it with their clothes on.  I kept expecting people to end up in closets as is typical of Hollywood movies but I happily adjusted my mindset.  Can we have more movies like this, please?",1437350400,5,877,4.730263157894737

Why was it the woman who was pressured into forgiving infidelity of her male fiance (with her best friend) on her wedding day and _carrying on_ with the wedding that same day?

The bride and groom did not meet until after she finished law school and became a lawyer, so obviously this wasn't a recent incident although that is what was displayed.

4329614,3,B004CWLRIG,Great movie with a slow start on overall concept of the story line.  Some roles were too much and didn't give much to show.  Would make for a girlfriend wine get together.,1410566400,,171,4.3125

The acting is terrible! Its a movie on a budget thats for sure. The movie takes place in a church for the entire hour and a half, no scenery change. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!",1391472000,,344,3.859154929577465

4329647,1,B004CWLRIG,"This movie has a very dumn complex message; cheating with the best friend. Just think what his friends are thinking about him banging her ""best friend""- high fives all day. She will be bringing this bull crap up every time they have a problem and that alone will destroy the relationship. Me personally I would have to see how he feels when I bang the s*** out of his best friend. If you love someone that much you wouldn't screw around on them at all and if you did hopefully it wouldn't be someone he knew-how heart-breaking is that.",1389571200,,535,4.414141414141414

4329649,3,B004CWLRIG,"I liked this movie but I felt that some of the acting was not as good as it could have been. Also, I felt that it could have been written a little better. Some of it didn't make a lot of sense to me. The groom waiting until the I do's to stop the wedding to talk was a little weak. I think that him pouring his heart out to her should have happened earlier in the movie.

Could have had a stronger story line.",1389139200,,409,3.8117647058823527
4329650,3,B004CWLRIG,So so movie. It was too slow pace for me. You can tell there was some type of secret from the beginning.  It made the secret seem more dramatic then it was. I'm glad it was a free movie.,1388880000,,186,3.769230769230769
4329651,2,B004CWLRIG,"This was bad. The idea that a woman would find out a terrible secret about her groom in the middle of her wedding ceremony and still move forward with the wedding on the very same day is not only absurd but a terrible precedent for how to realistically and genuinely deal with these situations.  It's also not fair to pull God in the middle of this catastrophe as an advocate for this behavior in order to guilt the person wronged into instant forgiveness.

Two stars for the lead actors who had to wrestle with this awful script.",1388707200,4,530,4.453608247422681

4329656,3,B004CWLRIG,Enjoyed the movie overall.  The 2 lead actors were very good.  Couldn't figure out the timeline of when the incident with the groom and bride's best friend happened.  Were they friends at the time?  Would recommend.,1382832000,,215,4.888888888888889

4329664,2,B004CWLRIG,"I love movies that express love especialy those showcasing black love. However, I did not care for this movie. In fact, there really was no movie at all. There was an obvious problem introduced at the beginning. The lead character ponders throughout most the movie and then there is a fast climax and resolution. I really just wish there was more dept to this story line. Okay, we know that they live happily ever, but how did they get there? It seemed as if the writer had a really good initial idea, but instead of taking his/her time and writing a paced and unpredictable script, the movie dragged with point-less dialogue and then BANG the end. There were clearly some other issues going on with the other non-lead characters but they seemed to be swept under the rug at the end with no resolution. This movie truly makes me wonder how easy it must be to get a film produced and marketed. This was clearly an amature attempt that should have been left inside the notebook of a first year writing student...not on the  big screen in hollywood.",1316390400,22,1046,4.5638297872340425
