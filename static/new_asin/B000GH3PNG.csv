2611323,5,B000GH3PNG,"I now own series one and two of this fabulous series. What a pleasure it is to watch really interesting and engaging stories suberbly acted by a cast that make it all so very believable - well almost. And what a delight the Scottish scenery is.

Without going into the story lines I would simply say that these programes are well worth watching, and well worth spending a hard earned dollar on! Like Monarch of the Glen and Ballykissangel, you can't go wrong.

Sadly, we now have to wait until the third series comes out. Perhaps Amazon could speed it up a little  :)",1167955200,22,567,4.4326923076923075
2611324,4,B000GH3PNG,"""Hamish MacBeth,"" a British Broadcasting television series based on characters created by the Scottish woman author M.C. Beaton, and set in Scotland, had its American tv premier in 1999.  It's set in a small village, Lochdubh, in the Scottish highlands, big sky country of mountain and loch, populated by eccentric, country-music loving characters, men who drink hearty, wear kilts-- surprisingly often, considering the climate, and gorgeous hand-knit sweaters.  It's nominally a mystery series, though some of the mysteries are mild, indeed, and it's just full of surprises.  You'd have to call it a village cosy mystery, I think, not the slightest tartan noir flavor to this one: minimal blood and violence, although lots of welcome slightly bent humor.

Biggest surprise to me, the starring actor, Robert Carlyle, raised in Maryhill, Glasgow, Scotland, rather a young man when this series was made; his trademark intensity greatly subdued.  He plays the title character, Hamish MacBeth, the local law, who finds himself bending the law as often as he enforces it.  It's not a town to run by the book.  Carlyle, who first caught the wider public's eye as ""Gaz"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Full-Monty/dp/6305622914/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Full Monty</a>; generally plays things deadpan in ""Hamish Macbeth"", leaving the breathtaking scenery unchewed: he's ably supported by an excellent cast, a cute Westie terrier, and the flavorful great outdoors.

Plots vary from the complex to the simple, and are frequently shot through with that sly subversive Scottish humor: they also occasionally feature the supernatural. One episode is about an older woman, walking on the beach by the loch, who accidentally steps on a live World War II land mine, and cannot step off it until it's disarmed.  MacBeth, who's come down to the loch to drown himself, must instead rescue her.

Several episodes in this series are credited to Danny Boyle, who has gone on to greater things on the bigger screen.  One, in particular, deals with the (fictional) rough Scottish equivalent of the Irish Blarney Stone, supposedly used for centuries in the coronations of Scottish kings.  It's been taken some centuries ago by the English, and is currently on display in Westminster Abbey, London.  A number of the local lads, wearing their kilts, of course, so they'll blend right in, liberate it from London and hide it by a local waterfall.  Pleasurable chaos ensues. Chief among the pleasures of this episode is the supposed long-lost brother of one of the more important supporting cast characters.  This long-lost brother has had the most remarkable  bad luck in his attempts to live a life of crime, and has lived most of his adult life in jail: most recently an Argentinian one, a life not likely to be pleasurable to a Scot.  He has also had remarkably bad luck in regard to accidents and injuries, and is as close as he can come to a bionic man without entering the realm of science fiction.  Yet he steadfastly, furiously, refuses to admit he's had bad luck.  So his nonexistent bad luck finally, in this particular episode, bites not only him, but also his brother, Mac Beth's right-hand man.

Now I love mysteries, generally the bloodier the better.  But the Scottish, positively non-twee charm of the Hamish Mac Beth series wins me over. So try it, you might like it.",1160006400,47,3411,5.187956204379562

2611341,3,B000GH3PNG,"This is the second of the three series featuring Hamish MacBeth, a constable in a small town in the Scottish Highlands.  Series one ended in quite a cliffhanger which this second series just ignores.  We are led to believe he must have chosen Alex since they are living together at the beginning of this series, but we are never provided with the resolution of the first series' cliffhanger type ending.  This series in particular started off just plain bizarre, but then had some good episodes mixed in.  The sad part is that Alex dies, which seems unfair to her character.  The writers really could have handled the situation better, which is a serious flaw in the show all throughout the series.  But if one has watched Series One, it won't be a waste of time to follow up with this series.",1328572800,,793,4.588652482269503
2611342,5,B000GH3PNG,"This is a fantastic  program with humor, compassion and a wee bit of mystery.

2611343,1,B000GH3PNG,"The Hamish Macbeth series is fun, although the episodes don't follow M.C. Beaton's novels accurately.  The Series 1 and Series 3 DVDs that I ordered seem fine, but the Series 2 DVD set was defective -- the first of the two DVDs wouldn't play on several players I tried.  Amazon handled the returned item well, and sent a replacement, but that one had exactly the same defect -- the first DVD wouldn't play!  So, I sent that one back too and requested (and received) a refund.  I went to BBC America Shop and bought ""Hamish Macbeth Series 2"" and it worked just fine.  So, I had to pay a higher price for the item from the alternate vendor but at least I finally got a DVD set that worked.  As far as the stories, they are well-written and well-acted and I recommend them for fun and enjoyable viewing.  The characterizations and plots are different than those in M.C. Beaton's books, though.",1301529600,2,890,4.490683229813665
2611344,5,B000GH3PNG,"This is a delightful series.  I had read many of the Macbeth books by M. C. Beaton some time ago, but I don't recall enjoying them nearly as much as I do the TV series.  Although the TV series shares some of the Macbeth self-immolation characteristic of the books, over all it seems to find some underlying goofiness, joy, and growth in the lives of its characters. Like Midsomer Murders,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-The-Early-Cases-Collection/dp/B0011B9W38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders - The Early Cases Collection</a>&nbsp;, which shares some of this boisterous background to murder, it entangles the viewer before they realize what they've gotten themselves into.  More than anything, I enjoy the stick-togetherness of the village people, and the almost magic combination of their silly insanity with stark tragedy is almost Shakespearean.  In the midst of tragedy appears a bit of comedy, and occasionally even a fool can be wiser than the wisest.  It's like a roller coaster with emotions up and down and all around in the small space of one two hour episode, and in the end the viewer comes out feeling somehow revitalized.

For those who've seen Series One, Series Two is a welcome return to a familiar venue.  As in good soap operas, the series characters have caught us up in the ongoing events of their lives, and we almost feel like they're personal friends.  This collection develops them all still further, while losing one who was close to us. My favorite of this series is No Man Is an Island, since it reveals that self revelation can be painful but that life goes on; and it does so because of others in our lives.  It also involves us in an almost Keystone Cops slapstick as the entire village becomes involved in an effort to keep Macbeth from being promoted and his temporary replacement from becoming permanent. The most delightfully insane of the set is A Perfectly Simple Explanation which is anything but!",1280361600,3,2008,5.230529595015576

2611347,5,B000GH3PNG,I thoroughly enjoyed this series when it was first aired. I even visited the village of Plockton where it was filmed during a visit to bonny Scotland. Watching it again many years later proves the plot and storyline are enduring and well written. Each episode is a self contained event with larger drama running across the series. The scenery is stark and beautiful and the characters highly individual and entertaining. Finally Hamish himself who is happy to live in a small regional centre and be left alone to act out his extended boyhood has some lessons for us all.,1183766400,4,570,4.767676767676767

I like the way he plays Hamish, and i really like Hamish's deputy, He really makes this show fun. the girl could be anyone, but the local oddballs make this show fun. I have read 3 or 4 of the books, but if you just watch the show without a preconcieved idea of how Hamish should look and act, you will enjoy the show for the fun of it. Just like alot of the british comedy. Sit back and get absorbed.",1180051200,5,455,4.010989010989011

2611350,1,B000GH3PNG,"M.C. Beaton's 'Hamish Macbeth' murder mysteries could have made a good TV series, like 'Inspector Morse' or 'Midsomer Murders' .  They have clever plots, interesting characters, stunning locations, and plenty of humorous touches.  Unfortunately, for reasons best known to themselves, the BBC chose to dispense with the plots and most of the characters from the books, and instead serve us up a bland soap opera with a Scottish setting. Almost nothing is left of the books at all.  If you enjoy programmes like 'Ballykissangel' and 'Monarch of the Glen' you will probably like this.  If you were hoping for a good murder mystery series you will be very dissappointed. This series was a total waste of time.",1171497600,13,705,5.0

2611352,5,B000GH3PNG,"Hamish Macbeth is a brilliant series... notably Scottish with a hint of Northern Exposure flavor.  The interplay and depth of the characters is amazing... the storylines are humorous with a great perspective on human nature... there is constancy, mysticism, passion, trust, and mystery in every episode.  Series two keeps building the story.  Every episode has me wanting to move to LochDubh and joining the village folk at the pub for a pint!!

Contrary to previous posters lament on offensive material, this could be nothing further from the truth.  Our family has learned to love this Scottish town and the people in it... We laugh and talk about the twists and always want to see more... We can't wait for the third season to come out!!  Every now and then we pull out the discs and start watching!!

Buy Series 1 and 2.. then start looking for the third!!  I'm trying to collect the hardback books... just can't get enough!!",1169856000,19,1019,4.782857142857143

I don't need to have my spiritual beliefs insulted by the overt insinuation that ""Christians""  is where the crazies are, and then have the crazies portrayed in a manner that makes it obvious the writers didn't even have a clue of what they were writing, or talking about.
