When you see ""the rest of the story"" (as the late Paul Harvey would put it), you will be astonished and infuriated at what a disservice and injustice was done to Walter L. Shaw. Technologies that shaped every facet of global business and personal efficiency thruogh communications, and are enjoyed (not only enjoyed, but strongly depended upon) by billions today were designed, developed and proven decades before they were made available to the masses, all the while, the brilliant genius behind all of them was not only deprived of his duly deserved monetary rewards, but deprived of the mere acknowledgement of his tireless work AND punished for violating the wishes of corporate greed and government injustice. Finally, he has a voice. Walter T. Shaw, the brilliant son of a genius, has redeemed a lifetime of rough paths and pulled together the story that should have been old decades ago.

This movie is a MUST SEE.  Artistically and tastefully developed, this movie tells a story, and the story needs to be carefully considered for good cause.

6260434,4,B00IE419J0,"""Genius On Hold"" (2013 release; 90 min.) is a documentary from writer-director Gregory Marquette, looking at the life and times of an inventor, Walter Shaw, who worked at AT&T (a legal monopoly of the entire US telephone system until its forced break-up in the early 80s) in the 1940s and 50s, and how upon leaving AT&T to start his own telephone business, he is thwarted and obstructed by AT&T on multiple occasions from doing so. As the movie reminds us, Shaw was a prolific inventor, eventually obtaining 39 patents for things like conference calling, forward calling, voice-activated speaker phones, etc. The second story line in the documentary is how all of this impacted Walter's family, and in particular his son Thiel, who eventually (for reasons I really don't want to explain here) ends up working for organized crime.

Several comments: separate and apart from the immediate story of the Shaw family (which in and of itself is quite compelling), the movie focuses on the bigger implcations of the interplay between big business (AT&T) and government (Congress voting to establish a legal monopoly), and more importantly, whether this can happen again, or in fact is it already happening (the financial industry's giant swindle during the crisis a few years ago). This documentary raises some very pointed questions in that regard. Concepts like ""corporatism"" vs. ""capitalism"" get examined closely, with chilling results. Walter's kids, Thiel and Linda, are interviewed extensively for this documentary, and Frank Langella is the narrator. Please note that Thiel is one of the producers of this documentary, so the Shaws' story is perhaps slanted in a certain way, but it doesn't take anything away from the bigger picture issues. I love a good documentary and I would readily recommend this.

I saw this documentary at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati last April (yes, almost a year ago), and am aurprised it has taken this long for it to show up on Amazon, but better late than never. The screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati was poorly attended, and this ended up playing only for a week. No matter, this is worth checking out, be it on DVD or on Amazon Instant Video.",1392940800,12,2201,4.978260869565218

Until I saw this documentary, I was not familiar with Walter Shaw.  However I am very familiar with the modern history of AT&T and Bell Labs.
Regarding the history of AT&T, the documentary is definitely accurate.

I highly recommend this documentary.  Excellent film.",1481673600,,302,5.1020408163265305

Well this song ""One More Day""is that song for me, & really well done documentary it was built for. The song tells you the story of Walter L. Shaw, & his brilliant mind that corporate America tried to steal from him... With all the trial, & heartbreaking tribulation he was washed through never a day went by that he ever lost his belief in himself, & the power to realize his dream.

8641427,5,B00IE419J0,"Walter Shaw worked for the phone company.  When the lineman was discovered to have some talent, he was promoted to engineering and got his degree.  The Bell system was so corrupt that it was able to stop him from getting any credit or financial reward for his incredible genius.  Many of the services we have taken for granted where actually created decades earlier by Mr. Shaw.  He became frustrated that he couldn't get recognition, he decided to go off on his own.  If you remember what happened to Tucker with the automotive industry then you can quickly see where this story heads.

Word gets out about Shaw's brilliance, the mob keeps getting caught running numbers because their phones are tapped by the FBI.  Walter comes to their rescue inventing call-forwarding which makes the call untraceable at that time.

Eventually, the Bell system prosecutes Shaw for using their phone line to test an invention,  Walter goes to prison for several years.  In the end, Bell continues to haunt his life in an attempt at thwarting his every creation.  He died a pauper.

This excellent documentary highlights the key events of the telephone's history starting after World War II to the late 1990's after deregulation.  It is another revelation on the power of corporatism against the lone individual.  This is a documentary not to be missed.",1415836800,,1338,4.915178571428571

The personal family story was fascinating and makes it worth the $ on it's own. Very interesting set of talents in the father - and the son (see Masterminds episode about the Dinner Set Gang)!
