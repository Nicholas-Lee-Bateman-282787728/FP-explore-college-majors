1882977,4,B00009IAXY,"Van Gogh nailed a canvas to a hay-wagon in his zeal to paint a wind-whipped landscape. Proust wrote hundreds of pages of prose in pursuit of a single memory. Cynthia Plaster Caster strives to capture an even more elusive and prized phenomenon than her artistic predecessors. For some thirty years, she has been creating life molds of the erect (or, sometimes unavoidably, semi-erect) penises of rock stars.
Early in the film, Cynthia makes it clear that she is not a ""size queen."" Her generous, appreciative spirit is only one of many things that makes this film a celebration of diversity the likes of which are seldom seen. As the film follows her through two castings (one substantially more successful than the other), the passion and logic of her quest uplifts the soul as much as it titillates the mind and body.
While the salt-of-the-earth heroine only grows in our estimation, any grist for post-modern irony has to be shaved off the backs of the run-of-the-mill freaks who surround her. Aging stars like Eric Burdon are seen first in blurry, hairy 60's snapshots, then as sagging, eyebrow-penciled wrecks reminiscing about their groupie years. A procession of preening young rockers, draggy hangers-on, pretentious gallery types and callow publicists underscore the point that C.P.C. is by far the most fulfilled, together, and focused person in her circle (with the possible exception of her attorney). She is that rare, heaven-anointed artist who never doubts her path for a second, and even gets to achieve her dream of a New York gallery show. The final, wildly successful casting session, shown in bravely orgasmic detail, is the best argument made for art in a movie since Charlton Heston saw his Sistine ceiling materialize in the clouds in ""The Agony and the Ecstasy.""",1073520000,14,1785,5.033783783783784
1882978,4,B00009IAXY,"I didn't know what to expect when I picked this one up. I've heard mixed reviews about Plaster Caster, but I'm a big fan of reality shows and ""slice of life"" documentaries, so I decided to check it out.  I'm happy to report I was pleasently suprised!  Ms. Plaster Caster is an interesting, funny, talented, and often pathetic person.  There's no question she's an odd duck, but she sure does keep interesting company! Oddly enough, for a movie about reproductive organs, the film has little to do with adult activities (only one breif moment with an on-camera casting.) It was also nice to see the late Noel Redding (Hendrix bass player) in one of his last interviews. The pace of the film moved along quite nicely and when it was over I felt I wanted more.
The good news is, there is more! The DVD is loaded with plenty of interesting out takes, including funny footage with Wilco's Jeff Tweedy and an L7 ""chest"" casting sequence.  I also liked the photo galleries and the Cast-O-Rama rotating cast gallery! With this feature you can have Plaster Caster's art (both boy and girl) loop on screen for infinity, if one chooses.  Great conversation video at parties!
I feel this documentary is worthy of a long hard look. (sorry about that, but I couldn't resist!)",1073433600,6,1261,4.662162162162162
7990786,1,B00009IAXY,"Most pathetic documentary ever and on Christmas morning to boot! The whole story could havd been told in 5 minutes vs 90. She had to drag by including  scenes of  her going to dentist and the laundry mat and so much bla bla bla just to get to the point (that all her ""junk""  souvineres would finally be featured in an art show). We struggled through this sad pathetic tale just to get to the Jimi Hendrix's story and see his family jewel donation  to her sad cause and of course that'she when the DVD crashed, because of a deep scratch in it. We ended up watching that part on youtube  (3 great minutes) and a few other 7 minute tales about Cynthia and other groupies. Those freebies were by far a much better deal. But  we did laugh a lot. The doc could actually be a hilarious SNL skit. And even funnier that it crashed right at the  Hendrix. I guess that's what we  get for being a bunch of pervs!",1483747200,,900,4.191860465116279
7990787,5,B00009IAXY,"I found this documentary ti be fascinating, funny, strange and a little sad.  Ms. Caster certainly concocted an interesting gimmick to gain the attentions of her rocker heroes, and persuade her art with fervor. But one can't help but feel if the cameras weren't rolling, she would just be sitting on the couch feeling sorry for her self.

Word is she's STILL working on her book.  Hope she finds the energy to finish it.  I'm sure it will be an interesting read!  Let's hope it's lavishly illustrated!

In conclusion, Plaster Caster is definitely worth an hour and a half of your evening, and at these prices, you can't go wrong!",1328400000,,629,4.672727272727273
7990788,1,B00009IAXY,"This video was a good idea, but was extremely poor quality. The video production and editing were below amateur level. It is a waste of time, offering no insight into the groupies or celebrities of the 1960s and 1970s.",1284163200,,218,4.615384615384615
7990789,2,B00009IAXY,I was really sorry I purchased this....with all the people she did they concentrated on musicians Ive never even heard of. It was slow moving to say the least and very boring. I don't recommend this at all.,1246579200,,206,4.447368421052632
7990790,2,B00009IAXY,"Even though this was a cult film, I didn't like it much. It was just average.",1212969600,,77,3.875
7990791,5,B00009IAXY,Superfantastic! Well worth owning 'cause you'll watch it at least a few times!,1177977600,2,78,5.076923076923077
7990792,4,B00009IAXY,"Rather like the subject herself this is more a curio than a particularly rounded enterprise. It also starts rather slowly, although this is the non flashy style chosen for the documentary and as it progresses we see the wisdom of playing this all rather dead pan. By the time we have discovered that the now mid 50 year old Cynthia is more interesting than we first thought and that maybe the plaster cocks are imbued with some significance we have Camille Paglia making good sense and a New York gallery preparing an exhibition. Everyone is likable, the old rock people talking about their castings 30 years before, the young bloods giving it a go now and the ladies of the past giving us a glimpse of the world of the groupie all that long time ago. But likable despite everything is Cynthia herself as she struggles with her landlady, her distant mother and her pots of plaster. 'And what will you be wearing?' asks a prospective candidate, with a leer and it is clear that dressing sexy had never even occurred to her. And yes the Hendrix anecdote is priceless.",1137024000,5,1065,4.610526315789474
7990793,3,B00009IAXY,"A profile of down-to-earth artist Cynthia ""Plaster Caster"" that should er, hold, the, er, attention of anyone fascinated by ""The Sixties"" or rock 'n' roll subculture in general. For the uninitiated, the ""Plaster Casters"" were a group of female ""artists"" (some may still argue, ""groupies"") who earned a universal backstage pass of sorts throughout the 60's and 70's by immortalizing the southernmost regions of many a rock legends' anatomy in plaster-based life-size sculpture. This would obviously guarantee many an amusing war story from (surviving) participants, and indeed, the most entertaining parts of the film are derived from such. One warning: The (somewhat deceptive) psychedelic cover art gives the impression that you might be in for a 60's time capsule, chock-a-block with vintage clips and music of the era; but the documentary is shot ultra low-budget direct to video, all ""present day"" footage with only an occasional still photo from the bygone days for context, and no ""period"" music to speak of. The overall ""feel"" is that of any one of the myriad of ""reality"" TV shows currently cluttering the commercial airwaves (of course, the subject matter here would be strictly ""premium cable""!) The ""extras"" actually redeemed the investment for this reviewer-particularly the additional backstage tales that Cynthia tells regarding Led Zeppelin (somewhat harrowing, actually) and her explanation of why Kiss was ""off"" her list from the get-go. An interesting companion piece to ""The Mayor Of The Sunset Strip"" (see my review on this site) as an examination of the ""almost famous"" who take thier succor from the aura of rock stardom.",1093910400,17,1643,5.2988505747126435
7990794,4,B00009IAXY,"I saw Cynthia Plaster Caster's ""babies"" on display at Threadwaxing Space in 2000, read about her in a 2001 issue of BB Gun, and was thus very eager to see this. I got my chance at a recent film festival, and thoroughly enjoyed it.
This documentary is as unique as its subject, who comes across as quirky, warm and eternally youthful, and whose craft provides us with a bizarre but indispensible bit of rock n roll memorabilia.
You'll love ""Plaster Caster"" if you're a fan of: British rock of the 1960s and '70s; the GTO era of LA; the ""indie"" music scene of the 1980s and '90s; dive bars inhabited by shaggy-haired rock n rollers; and the DIY aesthetic.
I'm definitely buying this on DVD.",1074643200,8,688,4.512
7990795,3,B00009IAXY,"This was a fun DVD. Not War & Peace but a good, fun view at the life of Cynthia. She is talented and sweet and very driven about her ""art"". It is art and it is her unique art that is true to the spirit she has. I like her, or what I get to see of her in this DVD. I say anyone who buys it will be happy with it.",1074211200,5,311,3.3333333333333335
