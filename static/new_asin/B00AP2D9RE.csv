5463565,5,B00AP2D9RE,"Such a great miniseries on dvd!  The story (much like the current ""Once Upon a Time"") has pulled a phenomenal twist on the original fairy tale, making Jack (the original) the bad guy and the giant as good.  The curse is interesting - all the Jacks die around age 40, and the current Jack must make amends to the giant in order to lift the curse!

It would be interesting to know the difference between this one-disc set at $17.98 (a reasonable price) and the other one-disc set at $64.99 (a totally ridiculous price, found here:  http://www.amazon.com/Jack-Beanstalk-The-Real-Story/dp/B00005UW87/ref=pd_cp_mov_0)!",1413244800,,613,5.288659793814433

5463568,5,B00AP2D9RE,"This was a great way to view Jack and the Beanstalk in a different way.  Matthew and Sara has have great magical chemistry.  All you fantasy buffs, if you want a different spin on Jack, please purchase.  Angelina Jolie's dad was hysterical.  When I first saw it, I taped it on VHS.  I just had to have the DVD.",1407196800,,310,4.186440677966102

8555568,4,B00AP2D9RE,"I'm giving it 4 stars because it's more adult like than child like. My grandchildren are 6, 5 and 2 so I had to fast forward a lot. I will be looking for a younger version of this story .",1504310400,,187,3.7

8555575,4,B00AP2D9RE,"I rented this movie on VHS in 2002 and watched it for the first time.  This film introduced me to the film acting of Matthew Modine and Mia Sara for the first time.  I liked the innocence and naivety of the character Matthew Modine portrayed in this film and Mia Sara was remarkably charming.  Matthew and Mia had great romantic chemistry on screen and the film had a smart plot from smart screenwriting.  Now my kids are mature enough to watch it so, I enjoyed watching it again recently with my kids.  It's a real joy to watch and the bad-Jack-character caused me to be introspective about my life.

The story parallels the Christian doctrine of the first Adam brought sin and spiritual death into the world and the second Adam, Christ, brought spiritual redemption, salvation and restoration for the World.  And, in this film, we have the first Jack bringing death and destruction to the other world and the last Jack brings restoration to that other world.  The chanting crowds wanting the last Jack to be executed reminded me of some Easter passion plays I've attended.

I'm glad the DVD is rereleased and affordable once again.",1457481600,,1133,4.710659898477157
