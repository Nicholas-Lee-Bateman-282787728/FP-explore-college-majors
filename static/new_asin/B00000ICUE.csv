7910625,5,B00000ICUE,I am a fan of the Avengers and finally started a collection. This set was the first i watched. I was a little worried as it has been years since I watched any. To my joy the scripts acting and presentation were all still great after so much time. The show is an original and really fun to see the chemistry between the leads was perfect. The stories off beat and fun. The sixties are well defined by this show. We will never see it's like again so get these while you can.,1362960000,,472,4.086021505376344

You can check out my full review of each episode there as well as my other more general comments about the series.

Also, be aware that when you buy the TWO volume set, it comes with an additional cardboard (very nice) packaging case to hold together the two Plastic DVD cases in one unit. This cardboard packaging has all the details of both DVDs on the outside.",1211846400,,629,5.463917525773196
