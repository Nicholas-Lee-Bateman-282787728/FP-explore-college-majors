8097415,2,B000CCHF0O,"Despite the fact that Amazon has listed this title as an ""All Regions"" DVD, the one that I purchased from their website would not play on either of my American-made players (Magnavox and Sylvania). This is a real shame since I've become a fan of the lead actress, Gloria Guida. It seems that none of her films are currently available in the Region 1/ NTSC format, and the only way to watch any of her movies on U.S. systems is on a DVD-R converted from the PAL format. More companies in this country need to become familiar with her work and start issuing DVDs to be viewed by American audiences!",1380326400,2,596,4.427272727272728
