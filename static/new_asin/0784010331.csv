73498,3,0784010331,"Paul Verhoeven has become among Hollywood's better known directors.  His most recent work, Starship Troopers, did well at the box office thanks to its outstanding special effects, interesting premise, and surprisingly good cast.
Verhoeven first earned widespread movie fame with Robocop, but it was 1990's Total Recall that stands as his best work.
Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a genuinely great performance as Douglas Quaid, a construction worker in the late 21st Century who, out of an unconquerable fascination with Mars - now a colony run by vicious corporate dictator Vilhos Cohaagen - goes to Rekall, Inc., a company that implants ""memories"" of experiences in those willing to pay.  But when Rekall implants a memory of a trip to Mars, it ""pops a memory cap"" in Quaid, who turns out not to be who he thinks he is.  When his wife Lori (the overrated Sharon Stone in the only performance of hers that is truly worth watching) tries to kill him, Quaid forces!  her to tell him that a supersecret Agency under the direction of Cohaagen erased his memory and implanted a new one.
Quaid dodges the guns of the murderous Richter (a delightfully insane performance by Michael Ironside) and gets help from a former buddy of his on Mars.  He then travels to the Red Planet and gets mixed up in a bloody civil war between Cohaagen's goons and rebel followers of a being called Kuato.  But seemingly nothing is as it appears to Quaid, until he learns from Kuato just what the secret is that Cohaagen wants.
It is fairly easy to point out what is wrong with this film - it is excessively violent and gory, and includes some action scenes - like a bloody bar brawl - that are unnecesary.  The pivotal scene - when Quaid is strapped in an implant chair to have his memory erased again, but he rips free and slaughters the scientists performing the procedure - is effective, but ruined because it allows Quaid to pull off an absurd flexing of muscle - he rips ! a heavy arm restraint out, anchor and all, and rips it thro! ugh the throat of one Cohaagen scientist thug.  There is also the usual absurdity of action films - the wholesale slaughter of enemy soldiers without so much as a scratch on the one or two good guys.  There is also a PREPOSTEROUS speech by Cohaagen during the final act that is a glaring example of the cliche of the villian who has the hero cornered, but spends so much time talking it gives the hero an opportunity.
Nonetheless, it is a superior script, with many twists and a fascinating climax.  END",902102400,,2515,4.631460674157303
73499,5,0784010331,"This is one awesome movie. From the start to finish, I was hooked.  First of all. Arnold actually did decent acting, which was a surprise.  Sharon Stone is superp and the cast and characters is wide and entertaining. Not one character seemed out of place. Now, as for the movie it self..it rtocks!! The way the director filmed humanity, dark and depressed in a decaying world both on Earth and Mars is very well done and amazingly realistic to human nature.  The story is entertaining with the main character, who is really not himself, is entwined in a series of events that uncover a great plot.  END",901929600,,602,4.598130841121495

73501,4,0784010331,"A semi-classic sci-fi adventure made back when Schwarzenegger could still do his own stunts. The story is based on a PK Dick story and is highly original. The twists are delightful and provide laughs without provoking too much though about the plot and how artificial memories are implanted to alter one's identity. After all, the concept of 'portable consciousness' is a consistent them in PKD's work. The film is funny at times, and has only a few dull moments; but the momentum and pacing are relatively even throughout. Only negative is that some of the acting and dialogue is a little goofy or campy, even for a film produced in the '90s.",1518566400,,643,4.75

 then at the end i saw that it was based on a Phillip K. Dick story which i hadn't read, and i thought ""well, duh!  of course!""

arnold isn't my favorite actor, but the movie works out well despite this.  very true to PKD's style (i still haven't read the book), although i expect very different in detail.  great supporting crew, great effects (for the time).  a winner

73513,4,0784010331,"While I've never been a fan of Phillip K. Dick's LSD soaked writing, I do have to say his work has made for some excellent science fiction films. The original Blade Runner is a classic, right up there with Aliens topping the list of my all time favorite sci fi movies. Total Recall isn't quite that stellar so I can't give it the same five stars. However it easily earns a solid four stars. The younger, non-political Arnold has an amiable charm that engages you and draws you right into the action. Much of the supporting cast is first rate. Watching Sharon Stone flawlessly shift from loving wife to sex kitten to stone cold killer then back again, often in the blink of an eye, is delightful. Michael Ironside has played variations on his role here a number of times over the years. Still, this is the movie which cast that original mold for him. Even many of the minor parts were played with pitch perfect tone. Mel Johnson Jr (Benny), Roy Brocksmith (Dr. Edgemar), Robert Costanzo (Harry), and Debbie Lee Carrington, (Thumbelina) all deserve special mention. The only weak spot in the cast  for me was Rachel Ticotin. She just didn't seem to have the acting chops to carry her role as a major action figure and romantic interest. She wasn't bad, just blah.

The cast carried the film, keeping it fun, but the script gave them an excellent foundation on which to build. The paranoid, adrenaline fueled rush of the plot with it's continued questioning of what was real and what was not gave the actors a great Phillip K Dick playground to romp around in. Done badly, the constant interplay between illusion and reality can leave an audience muddled and confused. Here it's handled well, leaving Arnold bewildered at times but keeping the audience comfortable and moving right along with the action.

The best comparison I can think of for Total Recall is The Fifth Element. Both are first rate, fun, sci fi romps. If you haven't seen Total Recall and if any of this review resonates with you, do yourself a favor and watch it. If you have already seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it again. I saw Total Recall in 1990 on the big screen when it first came out. I just watched it again in January 2018. It holds up well and is still great fun.",1515974400,3,2249,4.548148148148148

73530,5,0784010331,"I just watched this for the first time. I saw the remake in theaters a few years back, and it was atrocious. Now that I've seen the original, I consider the remake an affront. This film is intentionally over the top and corny; I mean it's our boy Arnie, but it's 10/10 for excitement and style. The sheer madness of all the crazy face-bending, mind-twisting, gross-out aliens (mutants, technically) and body horror combined with gratuitous headshots, alien (and some human) tits, the human body shields, Michael Ironside, Sharon Stone, and the whole supporting cast really getting into it, and the one-liners OH the one-liners in this movie will do you in. Not to mention the plot is easy to follow and has a decent hook. Too much to ask for anymore. Top-shelf Schwarzenegger here, folks. They don't make 'em like this anymore.

73536,1,0784010331,"If this film had been billed as a comedy instead of science fiction I would have given it a higher rating. But, alas, it seems that the director was only trying to appeal to the most unsophisticated audiences possible; and in that regard I guess he succeeded.

The acting was terrible throughout. Arnold was his usual wooden self with some of the worst dialogue imaginable. Even his patented tough guy one-liners were predictable and not funny (he says ""consider that a divorce"" after shooting Sharon Stone, his pretend wife, in the head). And most of his actions scenes, which comprised most of the movie, were simply laughable. It seems to me that Arnold's best acting work is as a robot.

Sharon Stone wasn't much better unless her goal was to portray a cartoonish, sleazy bitch that no one could take seriously. If that was the case she pulled it off.

It actually scares me to see so many reviewers rate this piece of trash 10 stars. What were they watching! How low are their standards! I suppose if all it takes are a bunch of loud explosions, lots of breaking glass, and completely implausible chase scenes to make one happy, then this film delivers on all counts. But is that what it has come to?

After viewing this gigantic failure I Googled Philip K Dick to see if he was still around to witness this atrocious portrayal of his work. He wasn't. It was sad to see that he died so young (53), but at least he didn't have to witness this insult to his talent and imagination. Oh well, we'll always have Blade Runner!",1514246400,,1525,4.534545454545454

OR
the more traditional war/hero based story telling. Arnie will save humanity from the alien villains visitors in next sequel. Follow sequels human learn from the alien technology  and fight the Armageddon type wars of other aliens far away from the solar system. etc

Then there's the animatronics. ""Quaid, start the reactor"". Perfect.
The over the top action and gore? Also Perfect. Gotta love old school Verhoeven.

I thought the mutants were important, as a dystopian view of humans made into mere slaves exposed to radiation living and doing  the work of a corrupt and uncaring corporation who controlled the very air they breathed on another planet. It was pathetic yet encouraging that some of the mutantations were in some way beneficial to the people. The twist is good, and the outcome was great. Some very sci-fi moments! It's a fantasy!

73595,5,0784010331,"This film successfully embodies both action thriller and intelligent science fiction. Much of the action is of course completely over the top and Arnie delivers many of his best one-liners. But behind the film's being another Arnie blockbuster lies considerable heart and intellect. Governments' callous indifference to the plight of the disadvantaged, governments' lies. governments' actions totally beyond the law...well, you get the picture. Most importantly, the film questions the notion of memory and especially memory as the basis for one's identity. it asks tough philosophical questions such as what is it about me that makes me truly me? and provides some tentative, thoughtful answers. Total Recall is actually better than the original Philip K. Dick short story We Can Remember it for You Wholesale. High praise indeed.",1480204800,,831,5.5

The evil corporation's control of the air supply is a very nice touch and given the state of the world today, there are many who wish they could do just that.  We'll see.

73639,3,0784010331,"Saw this again for comparison, and not only is it not the disaster I remember it to be, it is quite embraceable once you know to expect and accept the overall cheesiness and ridiculous finale.
It is also not the 'classic' many internet fans claim it to be: even if it has some nice touches and details, they tend to be unimportant and irrelevant*. Aside from that the movie is s subtle as a sledgehammer when a surgical scalpel is what is required.

A podcast I was listening to lately claimed that the movie might be construed as the implanted Rekall fantasy, but I am afraid it is just not the case. I did not remember, but the doctor at the hotel exactly states that - no bonus point for the viewer who makes a 'leap' which is explicitly presented right in the movie (more than once even.) The story has to be read straight forward regardless of foreshadowing dreams**, extreme coincidences***, nonsensical contradictions, things that just do not make sense****,  or being ""too perfect"" (something it claims to be - probably tongue in cheek.)

As it is this film is probable equally indebted to The Moon is a Harsh Mistress as it is to We Can Remember it for you Wholesale.

* A man who says he wishes he had three hands, ends up showing us he actually has three hands - even if one is a fake one; foreshadowing gasping, bug-eyed fish; ...and things of that sort.

** Ahnold has a dream that predicts the future - is he a mutant?

*** 'The Blue Sky on Mars' end is established as part of the implanted Rekall fantasy, but then how could a virtual tourist reconcile the fact that Mars does not have an atmosphere upon waking up? In the written fiction the evidence brought from Mars is something easily faked (I remember a box with few strange specimens...) But how could you fake a whole planetary atmosphere?

**** How did Ahnold manage to infiltrate the cell in his a-hole persona... And if he did, how or why would he need to erase this persona and create a new one that would not even remember any of it. The only logical explanation is that the a-hole persona is a fiction, except that the freedom fighters verify it was real!
Bullets on Mars even after Outland? WHY?

Why would you want a secret agent to stand out in a crowd? Why would you train an seven foot albino to be an assassin? Movies tend to be too focused on visuals for their own good (although to be fair the albino thing is direct from the Da Vinci Code novel.)

I think that this type of grotesque casting is something that we pulp/theatrical audiences will just have to live with, just as we have to accept that Dick Tracy or Bond villains are grotesque. But that could hardly be they main problem since the movie was and is still sold as a Schwarzenegger vehicle.
Having said that, yes, there is a problem with the casting, not only Arnold but also Stone - that is generally an increasingly accepted aspect of movies: actors seem less and less like real or normal people.

I forgot to mention, in Spanish ""cuate"" stands for twin. Hard to say if Kuato is derived from that, but it sounds close enough.

Also add to Atari (according to Blade Runner,) Sony Trinitron and Fuji Film as bad predictions of brands that will survive into the future.",1446422400,2,3217,4.454081632653061

73652,3,0784010331,"I  had  this  movie  on  VHS  at  one  time.  I  don't  know  what happened  to  it  exactly.  I'll  bet  this  one  was  an  interesting  role  for  (Sharon Stone)  to  play.  First  he  dreams  of  being  there  at  mars  both  him  &  Lori,  then  suddenly  it  turns  into  a  nightmare.  &  to  me  I  think  he  could  have  been  looking  into  the  future.  As  someone  signing  on  as  a  secret  agent  fellow  there  at  the  place  where  the  specialists  ask  you  questions.  That's  an  interesting  way  to  travel  where  images  can  be  as  real  as  it  gets!  Soon  Quaid  is  knocked  unconscious  &  into  the  dream  world,  he  soon  finds  himself  against  the  dream  scientists,  then  starting  with  his  construction  buddy  Harry  who  reminds  me  a  little  of  Danny DeVito  people are  trying  to  kill  him.  Richter  (Michael Ironside)  as  well, who  works  for  Cohaggen  (Ronny Cox)  (Robocop)  who  has  other  ideas  for  Quaid.  To  outwit  Richter  &  his  gang,  Quaid  must  hijack  a  Johnny  Cab  &  listen  to  his  mysterious  pal  &  wrap  a  wet  towel  around  his  head,  &  pull  the  bug  out  of  his  nose.  Surprisingly  his  own  wife  Lori  has  also  turned  on  him.  Then  gets  to  know  a  new  girl  called  Melina.  She's  not  as  pretty  as  Sharon.  She  wouldn't  listen  to  Quaid  the  first  time,  Then  eventually  she  joins  him  &  helps  him  fight  the  rebels. &  I  didn't  much  like  the  Mutants,  &  Kuato  who  sticks  out  of a  mans  stomach  &  isn't  any  bigger  then  a  human  baby.  Some  of  them  looked  like  they  had  scars  over  part  of  their  faces.  Except  I  don't  believe  they  were  scars.  Others  weren't  that  bad  looking.  I  liked  the  bars  &  the  rock  driller  thing,  &  the  sky  there  on  planet  mars.  Something  that  looks  like  the  sunset  or  sunrise  24  hrs  a  day.  What  I  found  most  thrilling  was  this,  Cohaggen  saying  (we  gave  you  lots  of  help,)  Quaid  having  the  purple  money,  the  guy  who  left  Quaid  the  suitcase  &  of  course  Quaid  dressing  up  as  a  woman.  I'm  telling  you  he  had  me  fooled  on  my  first  watch.  &  Benny  was  cool  until  he  betrays  him!  Quaid  also  must  defy  a  crooked  doctor  that's  explaining  things  to  him  then  tries  to  force  him  to  swallow  a  pill.  Doctor Lull  was  his  name.  He  says  he's  monitoring  Quaid.  Tries  to  get  him  to  see  things  differently,  When  Quaid  threatens  him  Lull  starts  raising  his  voice!  To  me  that  was  kind  of  funny.  Quaid  rejecting  him  &  pissing  him  off!  Those  were  all  conclusions.  &  he  must  also  reject  the  doctors  who  are  trying  to  get  Quaid's  old  name  Hauser  back  so  that  he  can  take  Cohaggen's  side.
Who's  cut  off  the  air  supply.  Now  its  up  to  Quaid  to  be  the  hero  &  save  Mars!  Regardless  of  what  he  must  go  through  first. &  destroy  &  crush  Richter  &  Cohaggen!  I  suppose  Arnold  does  have  a  desire  for  being  the  hero.  One  thing  I've  learned  about  (Michael Ironside)  is  that  he's  always  intense  in  any  show  or  movie.  I  was  surprised  to  learn  that  he  took  a  role  for  several  episodes  on  (Walker Texas ranger).  I  do  wish  to  comment  on  the  Johnny  cab,  the  little  robot  man  in  there,  He  does  look  kind  of  goofy,  &  the  silly  faces  he  makes  with  his  eyes.  The  smirk  like  smile  of  his.  He  looks  like  a  hotel  bellboy,  Very  impressive!  You  just  think  about  how  goofy  &  silly  they'd  look  if  we  had  them  in  real  life!
It  does  have  a  good  ending.  Its  okay  as  far  as  the  action  goes.",1436918400,,3742,4.204620462046204

It was done very, very shoddily. In 2012, the Mind-Bending Edition was released. In short, I will say that the 2012 edition redeems the movie and shows it in fine splendor. The video was given a very respective transfer from the original stock and supervised by Paul Verhoeven himself (doesn't that man get any work of late?). The audio's great, too; lossless and beautiful. The special features? There's plenty galore to be had. Definitely more than the prior cut.

Lastly, know that there is a 2015 re-release of Total Recall which offers Blu-Ray and UV. I have not seen any reviews on it yet, but it's priced around $10-11 as of this writing.

you have Brilliant script written by both Ronald shusett & the late Dan O' Bannon who passed away some years ago
and you also have Director Paul verhoeven & Great Actor Arnold schwarzenegger for the film
aswell as Great Actor Michael ironside, Ronny cox and Sharon stone when she was in her prime
plus don't forget special make up effects artist Rob Bottin and his team
which i still think his special effects done in the film still Hold up today, better than CGI effects
it's the Cream of the crop in this film
better than the stupid remake with Colin Farrell, but it is matter of opinion
your either loyal to this Schwarzenegger version or you like the remake better, or you like both versions

TOTAL RECALL has been released on blu-ray twice now plus the special edition dvd release from 2001
this Mind-bending release is the 3rd and latest release of the film on blu-ray
scrap the previous blu-ray releases
and get this new Mind-Bending edition which has a new High definition transfer in 1:85:1 widescreen
supervised by Director Paul verhoeven so it says on the back cover
and i tell you what this new blu-ray transfer looks fantastic, an excellent clear pictured transfer, not much Grain at all
better than the old dvd release of course
plus a new 5.1 Master audio mix has been added to
i think maybe 6.1 or 7.1 mix should have been added aswell, the sound quality would be incredible
but there's only a 5.1 master audio mix
and that's not all,

there's a new special feature on this blu-ray a long with the old extras of course
every single special feature from the old special edition DVD is on this blu-ray
IMAGINING TOTAL RECALL Documentary,
MODEL & SKELETONS featurette which is about the special effects of Total recall
the old TV promo featurette only goes for about 8mins which was filmed during the making of the film in 1989-1990
a restoration comparison where the VHS or DVD print of the film is compared with this new blu-ray transfer of the film
which may be interesting to some fans i guess
and the old DVD commentary by Paul verhoeven & Arnold schwarzenegger is on this blu-ray aswell
there's also the Trailer & Photo Gallery aswell
the extras are not in High definition, more like Dolby digital surround sound
except for a brand new 1hour length interview with Paul verhoeven filmed just for this new blu-ray
which is in HD ofcourse
very very interesting interview to, Paul speaks in Great indepth detail about TOTAL RECALL
some things he talks about that he didn't mention in the 2001 Documentary for the special edition DVD of the film

The ending is okay, but the whole journey kind of makes sense with the director's intended meaning. It looks beautiful on Bluray and is definitely worth a 5 dollar or less purchase.

73694,5,0784010331,"This is a review of the Blu-Ray copy

There is no digital download with this copy

This is the original 1990 Total Recall I think much better then the 2012 version myself.

Total Recall (1990

Quaid, a 2084 construction worker haunted by dreams of Mars in this crowd-pleasing science fiction spectacle. Against the wishes of his sexy blonde wife, Quaid goes to Rekall, a company that implants artificial memories, so he can ""remember"" visiting the red planet that is now being settled by human inhabitants. However, Quaid is actually an amnesiac secret agent from Mars - or is he?

Video Quality:
Total Recall is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of StudioCanal and Lionsgate Films with an AVC encoded 1080p transfer in 1.85:1. This is an all new high definition transfer supervised and approved by director Paul Verhoeven and struck from the original camera negative. As evidenced by the restoration comparison included on this Blu-ray as a supplement, the results are rather dramatic. Contrast is markedly better in this presentation, as is color timing and especially saturation. Despite the plethora of scenes bathed in red, fine object detail pops impressively, especially in close- ups. No extreme digital tweaking appears to be in evidence, so this transfer has a beautifully filmic appearance, with a nice layer of fine grain overlaying the entire film. Total Recall was done in the days of practical and optical effects, and those occasionally show their age, but not to any real detrimental effect.

Audio Quality:

Total Recall offers lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mixes in English, French and German (and sample the German track to hear Arnie speaking in his native tongue). The English track is an incredibly visceral experience, completely immersive and wonderfully nuanced. The film zooms from set piece to set piece with an abundance of gunfire, snapping bones and other foley effects clearly directional and rendered with excellent fidelity. Dialogue and Jerry Goldsmith's nicely bombastic score are well prioritized and are delivered cleanly and clearly. Dynamic range is extremely wide and LFE is utilized very effectively in several key sequences.

Instead of erasing the memory of unpleasant events, people would submit to the addition of fake memories of pleasant events. This could lead to philosophical musings on the nature of the self, the stream of consciousness, and whether this makes a difference - if it matters whether a memory is of a ""real"" event or an artificial one, if it's impossible to tell the difference.

Instead, this is just an introduction for an extended chase, shoot-em-up spy thriller. There are some great special effects for the time - Schwarzenegger removing a golf ball-sized tracking device from his nose, a costume head that forms horizontal slices as it comes apart, the clear outline of a gun against a skeleton on a spaceport monitor. In this future world, the trip from earth to Mars is so routine as to need not a single frame; we go straight from one planet to the other with no intervening travel time, not even one shot of the inside of a spaceship. Once on Mars, the chase is on, in a world ruled by a dictator who turns people into mutants by denying them sufficient air and protection from radiation.

Mel Johnson, Jr.'s character seems to start off as a ""magical negro,"" however, he quickly morphs into a shuckin'-and-jivin' clown before finishing as a treasonous villain. A vicious martial-arts battle between the lovely Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin was groundbreaking for the time - two hot chicks fighting! It's almost as good as lesbian porn. The ending trumps everything that came before it, however - we are asked to believe that the sudden development of an atmosphere would not result in cataclysmic storms; it's no more violent than the effect of putting on a scuba mask.

Valuable only as a ""classic"" (if you're into science fiction, Arnold Schwarzenegger, or both), this can be recommended to anyone who has committed to seeing every film ever made.",1403395200,2,2320,5.264864864864865

Dick work into a subtle and contemplative masterpiece, director Paul Verhoeven took a more action-packed and mind-bending approach with his film. Is it better? They're almost impossible to compare. Blade Runner is probably of more cultural and cinematic significance, but Total Recall certainly has the edge when it comes to the pure entertainment department. As soon as Arnie starts freaking out in that Rekall chair, the film's pace hardly slackens for the rest of its silly ride and the action is bloody good fun. Verhoeven was the perfect director for this kind of project, mostly because of his stylish yet trained camerawork. Some directors are made for action, others for drama. Paul isn't inept when it comes to drama, but it's obvious he's most comfortable and effective with a fast storyline. The role of Quaid/Hauser probably would have benefitted from a more refined actor than Schwarzenegger, who is only slightly above Tommy Wiseau in versatility; however, Arnold has a quality about him that makes not only the character he plays more memorable, but the film as a whole. He works well in zany, unbelievable scenarios, and this film is certainly in that jurisdiction. Total Recall has twists aplenty, thrilling action sequences, Arnie being Arnie, cool production design, and a mutant prostitute with three breasts.

73726,5,0784010331,"DO NOT WATCH THE REMAKE

This Arnold's best movie outside of the Terminators, Clash of the Titans and Junior(Yes I reviewed).  This is a must watch movie, I think you get like your ass kicked if you don't watch it.

Set in the future, Arnold plays a construction worker named Quaid, who fantasizes of a life of adventure while he is working his menial job jack hammering away at a construction site.  There's a business called Rekall(I forgot how its spelled); they offer to put you into a chair that will allows to live out a fantasy life while you are asleep at the chair.  The only problem is that some clients occasionally experience problems, such as people being sent into psychosis and not going back to their normal self.  One of Arnold's construction pals warns him, but we the audience are not quite sure the true reason why he warns them.

DO NOT WATCH THE REMAKE

Arnold goes to Rekal, talks to the representative and is convinced.  He spends some time, chooses from options and is put into the chair.  Something goes wrong though, his brain is messed up and he ends up becoming the personality of the person he would take on in the fantasy.  He think hes the person in the fantasy, a spy sent on a mission of some sort.  He goes nuts, kills a a few people in the office, takes off, is confronted by his construction friend from earlier, kills them and then goes home.  He talks to his wife Sharon Stone and believes that he is on mission, people are trying to kill him and he must go to Mars.

IN CASE YOU DIDN'T READ EARLIER, DO NOT WATCH THE REMAKE

He sets off on his adventure to Mars, believing he must find someone named Kuato and aid him in some sort of resistance. The whole time, the movie is a series of awesome action scenes and the sci-fi elements play throughout.  As the movie progresses, we began to see that who he becomes might be his true identity as he takes part of a larger plan, which involves an evil guy who wants to keep the aliens on Mars in check by controlling the oxygen.

The movie was directed by Paul Verhoven and this is his best after Robocop and Showgirls.  If you at all into Arnold movies, action movies or sci-fi, this is a must-watch.

73728,5,0784010331,"""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" The Movie!

Kidding, but this film is based on the book (title above) written by Philip K. Dick. This movie embodies the adventure and intrigue that movies today just don't have anymore. The is movie, like The Matrix and Inception after it, plays with the intricate concept of whether the situation the characters are in is real or not, or in this case a singular character. From that premise alone, you had to know you where in for an awesome movie.

Okay so on the surface, it's all about Arnie (Douglas Quaid); a man who, from what I can tell feels as if something is missing in his life, and now it's time for spoilers! everything past the SPOILER WARNING may damage your perception of this film, so you've been warned.

SPOILER ALERT

Actually, it's not even his life; everything that has happened to him has been fixed to accompany a fake memory he was given, and you guessed it, the illusion is broken when he goes to Rekall.

Rekall is actually the monumental aspect that makes or breaks the ""Dream"" perception of this film.
When he sits down in the chair, he has a type of attack on his subconscious, but what the audience doesn't know is whether or not he's in reality or in his dream that he purchased.

The Problem: Everything In The Dream seems real, but the progression of events still follow the dream purchase.

After some important plot points happen (go watch the movie and you'll see what i'm talking about), He gets to Mars,
more extremely important stuff happens, and now we come to another moment of intricacy.

The Inventor of the dream implant machine has arrived on Mars, with absolutely no explanation whatsoever, and the whole scene goes out of its way to explain whats happening, which brings us to another problem.

The Antagonists in this movie know that Quaid is suffering an identity crisis and isn't sure what's real or not, and the possibility
of them using this against him is a factor that needs to be considered, but the fact remains that the gentleman from Rekall is now
on Mars, and we're all wondering the same thing, why?

The point is, there is so much detail and intricate plotting in this film that whether or not it is real is never explicitly stated;
As it stands, there's enough evidence to support both sides of the argument, and that's what really makes this movie interesting.

As for the bottom line, i'm gonna call this a
94%- Impressive, Gritty, and Intricate, Total Recall is a triumph and easily one of Paul Verhoven's best movies.",1396915200,2,2525,4.613839285714286

Total Recall with Arnold is not only creative and suspenseful, but the first movie where I was really knocked over by the sets, and especially, the art work. Just stellar, stunning work. I think they won the Oscar in that category. (Imagine, the Academy getting something right:)
It's a must have in 1080. I'll give my older regular DVD to my son.
Arnold, Rachel Ticotin, Ronny Cox (just a kid in Deliverance), Michael Ironside are perfect. Also, it's my favorite Sharon Stone role hands down.

In this explosive sci-fi adventure that unfolds in the year 2084, Arnold is Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who doesn't realize that recurring dreams of the planet Mars are the only vestiges of a past life that's been erased from his memory. Everything that ""Douglas Quaid"" now knows is fake, including his marriage to blonde knockout Lori (Stone).

One day, Quaid is given a suitcase containing a video player that shows a recording of himself explaining how his mind's been messed with. Quaid is instructed by his cheery pre-recorded self to first remove a device implanted in his head (see above) then get to Mars ASAP, where the action becomes far more intense than the excitement he (and we) have already seen. It's a great film, one of Arnold's very best.

""Total Recall"" is inspired by Philip K. Dick's short story, ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale.""

73756,5,0784010331,"Though not as good as ""Robocop"", I have a soft spot for Paul Verhoeven's ""Total Recall"".  The mixture of goofy camp and thought-provoking science fiction is great, while the terrific action, over-the-top violence (see also: Robocop) and excellent twists keep things exciting.  But you already knew that, or you wouldn't bother picking up a Blu-ray re-release of a film that was beaten to death on DVD over the years.

The only bad thing about this ""Mind-Bending Edition"" is the name.  Verhoeven approved the transfer, which looks clean, crisp and bright...especially compared to older DVD editions and even the first Blu-ray release.  Extras are interesting and plentiful, and many of them have been ported over from older releases, including a vintage Criterion commentary and several behind-the-scenes featurettes.

73766,3,0784010331,"Everyone else had already discussed the plot, storyline, acting and the double dipping of multiple releases.  I focus only on the quality of this release on blu ray and have a couple of different Standard Def. DVDs of the film.

This release is supposedly the latest and greatest and compared to previous releases I suppose it is, but it is far from perfect.

VIDEO.....The video transfer to blu ray is said to have gone through a true restoration of the colors and everything involved in the production.  I did not see any artifacting at all and that is good.  There is, however, a patina of grain throughout the entire film.  After awhile the grain was no longer a distraction to me but it was something I hadn't originally expected.  Having been first released in the theaters in the late 80's, film grain was the norm and that there remains grain in this release shows me that they did not use DNR too excessively otherwise the grain would be gone but so would have the many details in faces, fabrics and other objects.  The colors tend to pop in places and the heavily red scenes do not bleed.  The color red is hard to reproduce in films,especially so when used as text.  Overall, the color correction is quite good.  Mbps ranges averages between the low and mid twenties but I do question the validity of judging Mbps rates.

AUDIO.....  The lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audio is seamless in its volume levels and dialogue is wonderfully transparent and easy to understand.  The music score is widely placed on the front stage, they did an excellent job on the score.  Because most of the action takes place in front of the camera, naturally, it is the front audio stage that is used the most.  There is some good panning between the left and right surrounds as well as some nice foley effect directionality between the front stage speakers.  The rear surrounds are used very sparingly for any effects at all which surprised me as there were plenty of opportunities directed by the action of many scenes where they could and should have been utilized.  The LFE sub channel gets a great workout for much of the film and there are some decently low sub work to reproduce.  Certainly not the deepest I have heard my sub go but powerful and transient enough to satisfy.

Unfortunately, there are 5 different previews of other movies on this disc.  Those long previews, ads that you the buyer pay for,  take up a significant amount of disc space that could go towards an even less compressed feature film.

EXTRAS...Most of these extras could be found on other versions.  The typical commentaries with the director and with Arnold as well.  For the fat lady scene I turned on the commentary to hear what they would say about the scene as I had taught with the actress who had played her for several years.  Once done, I found that I could not turn off the commentary.  I went back to the bonus features, hit on the commentary again hoping to get out but still could not.  Eventually, I had to pop the disc back out and put it back in and use the scene selector to pick up where I left off.
  One of the extras is a Restoration Comparison.  This was completely bogus.  Basically, it plays a scene and a thin white wipe goes left to right showing you how much better this version is than the previous versions.  However, what they used for the 'previous version'  had a pinkish haze over it so that the differences would look dramatic.  It was complete BS as none of my standard def version look anywhere near as bleached out as what they were showing.  In the new release of Jaws that came out last  year, there was also an extra showing how the film was restored.  It not only showed the differences but explained how the process proceeded.  For this release of Total Recall, it had no narrative, just the bogus wipes.
  Other extras included trailers, Making of featurette, a doc on the models and special fx and photo gallery.

My complaints regarding the previews and Restoration Comparison have little to do with whether I recommend this release.  As it is considerably cleaner than the previous Blu Ray release, I am glad I have it and, therefore, would recommend it for fans of this film of which I am one.  Was I blown away by this great Blu Ray release...No.  Still, happy to have it in the collection.

All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.

73774,5,0784010331,"A gloriously violent, late 80s/early 90s action film that wisely jettisons much of the psychological angle in favor of giving Arnie yet another vehicle to do what he does best - fire very big, very loud guns and quip in that thick Austrian accent of his.  Like his previous film, Robocop, Paul Verhoeven makes the blood 'n' gore so over the top it's totally comic book in style, although truly squeamish people might want to keep away regardless as I doubt they'll become desensitized.  Critics have, in the past, questioned Arnie's involvement and suggested a less... 'meaty' actor in the role, but that just isn't what this version of the movie is about (the inferior 2012 version starring Colin Farrell might be slightly nearer the mark, I guess, although neither are really like Philip K. Dick's 'We Can Remember It for You Wholesale' story).

As for the Blu, Total Recall has had a bit of a checkered history regarding its various disc releases around the world - it's never looked truly fantastic but I'd say this transfer is a vast improvement on earlier ones.  Also worth pointing out the 'Mind-Bending Edition' does actually have bonus features (commentary, making of, trailers, etc) since Amazon's 'Special Features' show as 'None' at time of writing.",1367193600,,1261,4.933962264150943

Add a well-designed set that make you feel you are there. In addition, you have the makings for a pretty good movie. With a few exceptions, it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad and with several plot twists; it is hard to know if you should root for the good guy or the bad. A hint stick with Arnold and you cannot go wrong (Maybe.)

Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) a mild mannered construction worker, who is happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone), and seems extraordinarily attracted to life on Mars. Now Mars is settled and basically ran by a mining consortium. Moreover, the least Douglas can do is take a vacation there. Discouraged by his wife he decided to take a virtual trip there.

Oh no, something has gone wrong. It turns out that unknown to him he is not Douglas Quaid. He finds out that his whole history is a lie. Now people are out to kill him and he must find out who he is and why. If he escapes, the journey will take him to Mars to fulfill his or someone's destiny.  Good or bad, we are along for the ride.

73779,5,0784010331,"It's like a nightmare out of Kafka: everything you can remember is false, and everything you think you know about your life is a lie. Such is the dilemma at the heart of ""Total Recall,"" which also has the honor of being one of the best movies Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever made. A lot of this comes from the plot, which is full of memorable twists and clever plotting -- not to mention the glorious depiction of a futuristic Mars.

Every night, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger) is haunted by a dream of Mars and a strange woman (Rachel Ticotin). He even wants to visit Mars, but his wife Lori (Sharon Stone) is reluctant. After all, Mars is going through a nasty rebellion at the moment. On impulse, Quaid decides to go to Rekall, a company that implants false memories for entertainment, and selects a ""secret agent"" fantasy on Mars.

But things instantly go very wrong when he has a convulsive reaction, and ends up dumped in a taxi. As he tries to get home, his coworkers all try to kill him -- and at home, Lori also tries to murder him, revealing that their entire marriage is a false memory.

Quaid goes on the run, with only a cryptic message from his former self to guide him. But even if he can get to Mars and avoid being captured by Lori and the cops, he has to find the mysterious Melina (who turns out to be the lady from his dream). And as he seeks out the mysterious leader of the Resistance, Quaid finds that there may be things in his past he doesn't want to remember...

""Total Recall"" doesn't stick very closely to Philip K. Dick's original story, but it doesn't shame it either. The story is delightfully unpredictable from beginning to end -- while you might be able to figure out quickly that Quaid is remembering lost memories of Mars, most of the plot twists after that are genuinely shocking. And underlying everything is the haunting question: Is any of this real?

This is Paul Verhoeven back when he was good, and ""Total Recall"" displays him at his best -- lots of action-packed fight scenes, gruesomeness (the removal of the tracker up Arnold's nose is especially gross), and an underlying current of humor that keeps things from ever getting too grim ("" If things have gone wrong, I'm talking to myself and you don't have a wet towel around your head"").

And lest anyone forget it's a sci-fi movie, most of the action takes place on a delightfully sleazy Mars colony where mutants walk amongst the normal humans. Example: Quaid speaks to a three-breasted hooker at a bar. And there's a subplot about a mysterious set of alien machines that only comes to fruition late in the story.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of those actors that is normally pretty mediocre, but is amazing when he's got a good script and direction. He overflows with humor and charisma in this role (""Consider that a divorce!"") and he has excellent chemistry with Ticotin. This is a hero you can actually root for, but we're also constantly reminded that we don't know the real man.

""Total Recall"" is a like taking a rollercoaster ride, with lots of wild action and thrills -- as well as one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best performances ever. Definitely worth watching.",1365552000,,3170,4.618117229129663

73785,5,0784010331,"There's no doubt in my mind that Arnold Schwarzeneggar is the greatest action star of all time. He's been in so many great movies, like True Lies, Predator, and, of course, the awesome Terminator movies, but one film of his that I find incredibly entertaining is the brilliant sci-fi flick Total Recall.

In the film, Arnold plays Douglas Quiad, a man who dreams of one day visiting Mars, which, in the future, is in a constant state of violence thanks to a group of rebels who demand cheaper air. Unable to convince his wife to vacation there, Doug goes to a place called `Total Recall', where he pays to have a memory of mars implanted into his brain, eliminating the necessity of going on an actual trip. As a bonus, he requests that the memory he receives will be of him as a secret agent, as opposed to an average joe.

As soon as the procedure begins, Doug starts freaking out on the technicians, who instantly put him back to sleep. While he's asleep, they inform us that his memory has been previously erased, and that they accidently brought it back to life. When Jack wakes up, once again unable to remember what happened, he is immediately thrown into a world of secret agents, as he's chased by a criminal all the way to Mars, where he realizes that his entire existence is an elaborate conspiracy, orchestrated by the evil air company.

The story is absolutely engrossing. There's action every step of the way, and the plot has more twists and turns than anything made by M. Night Shamamamalsnan. Even though on the outside it may seem like standard action fare, the film is loaded with thought-provoking materia. The ending, in particular, requires the viewer to decide for themselves what has happened.

For a film made in 1990, the special effects are absolutely incredible. Actually, the effects in this movie look much better than the lazy CGI that congests modern sci-fi movies (with a few exceptions, district 9 being one of them). The make-up effects are something to be proud of as well, especially the Kuato puppet, which looks hideous yet awesome at the same time. And, of course, there's the infamous lady with three boobs. The sets on Mars are impressive too, with the whole place coming across as a scummier version of Mos Eisley.

Total Recall is an incredible action film, an incredible sci-fi film, and an icredible film in general. It succeeds on every level, and it's entertaining as hell. It's best of it's kind, and I love it.",1363478400,,2460,4.685185185185185
73786,5,0784010331,"After experiencing recurring dreams of an alternate life on Mars, Douglas Quaid visits Rekall, a company that deals in virtual vacations, to receive memory implants of a trip to Mars with an added package that would transform him into an interplanetary spy. Before the procedure can begin, however, Quaid experiences a schizoid embolism that awakens hidden memories which had been erased from his mind, and suddenly finds himself in the middle of a corporate conspiracy that will take him back to Mars as he fends off evil mercenaries in an attempt to save the planet. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in the explosive Sci-Fi thriller TOTAL RECALL, from 1990! Director Paul Verhoeven takes us along on this wild adventure through the futuristic streets of Earth in the year 2084 and beneath the red sands of Mars using mind-blowing make-up, production designs, and digital effects that earned the film the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects that year. The adrenaline-pumping action and suspense never let up from beginning to end, while the audience is left to decipher whether the events on screen are really happening, or if this is all just part of some elaborate nightmare. Arnold is better than usual as our exciting action hero, this time going up against a menacing Michael Ironside in another of his stereotypical roles as the film's baddie. With a compelling and complex storyline to match its jaw-dropping special effects, TOTAL RECALL earns its place as one of the strongest Science Fiction films from the 1990s.

73812,5,0784010331,"This will be a little about the Picture Quality of the transfer, and the film itself.

Quickly, I have always loved Total Recall, and enjoy waiting until I see older films cleanly transferred to see them better than I ever had the possibility to see. It has been years before now since I'd watched it, and we are still impressed with some of the special effects.

PICTURE QUALITY of the 'Mind-Bending Edition' : I couldn't believe how clean the transfer was, and it does not look fake and overly corrected. Ill admit I couldn't detect any overly smoothed out details. The PQ is so well that I can set my SONY to 100% Sharpness, and I still get no grain. I only noticed grain during the first scene, and honestly I don't mind it. That scene is not colorful, long, nor does it last long.

SOUND: The sound was great. I would say a noticeable improvement in volume accuracy etc.

I'm not a good reviewer, but I will just say this is my personal favorite version of Total Recall, and Im extremely picky about PQ. I watched Ghostbusters in BluRay and had to sell it right away due to more noise on the screen than the original DVD. That isn't the case here. GREAT job on the transfer!",1357948800,2,1179,4.394495412844036
73813,4,0784010331,"Some people have mentioned the transfer on this movie wasn't the greatest. Do they not 'recall' how the original VHS looked, 22 years ago? It wasn't the highest resolution then either. I can only see a couple scenes where the transfer perhaps wasn't the best, but for the most part, the movie looks like I remembered it from the VHS, if not a little better. I purchased it in its digital form, so we can watch it on our Roku, so maybe it looks a little better than the DVD's. The reviews of how the movie looks on DVD is the reason I purchased the digital version.

We had the tape for a long time then sold it in a garage sale. I've wanted to watch it several times since then, but didn't have it. After this latest atrocity that was called a 'remake' came out, I had to see the original again. I like it much better than Colin Farrells's version. Yes, it's cheezy, and yes, it's Arnie, but it's still a classic action movie. And it makes one wonder.....how far did they get in Doug Quaid's Mars secret agent implant? Did he really bring down Cohaagen, or was it all a Total Rekall dream? Hmmmm........",1357516800,,1103,4.328502415458937

73815,4,0784010331,"When Total Recall came out, it had unbeatable combination of elements: 'Ah-nuld' was the God of Adventure Movies, (director) Paul Verhoeven had proven that he has massive sci-fi chops with the original 'RoboCop', the story was based on a Philip K. Dick short story (""I Can Dream It For You Wholesale""), featured a score by Oscar-winner Jerry Goldsmith and was a truly BIG BUDGET EPIC.

The thing that was most amazing about this was that all those elements actually coalesced into a classic interplanetary mind-screwing sci-fi adventure movie. These many years later, 'Total Recall' is still a blast for the eyes and ears...and, has enough Dick-ian complexity left to raise it above most actioners.

This remastered version is the kind of movie that HD screens and surround sound systems (with powerful sub-woofers) were created for. The images are crisp and clean...the sound fidelity marvelous...and, Ah-nuld never looked so tough.

Add great supporting actors/characters, brilliant miniature work and a real zest brought to the whole thing by its participants...and, you have one of the best ways that I know to indulge in true escapism.

73827,5,0784010331,"I saw Total Recall in the theater when I was young and footloose and as I have always been sci-fi girl, I enjoyed it immensely. The inspiration for the tale, like many of the great contemporary science fiction movies comes from a short story by the great Philip K. Dick. Hearing that a remake had been made, I returned to the original with some trepidation - would it be as good as I remembered? Or would it be a cringe worthy cheese fest? It turns out that Total Recall is a minor classic and not nearly as dated as I expected.

Quaid is a construction worker living a mundane life in an unnamed city with a lovely wife, though he is plagued by both a sense of greater destiny and nightmares about the colony on Mars. To try and solve this problem Quaid goes to a company that provides mental vacations in the form of implanted memories. He signs on to have the memories of a Mars adventure complete with femme fatale, spies and saving the downtrodden adventure, but is the adventure real or implanted? Before the memories are implanted, Quaid goes into a seizure due to complications from another memory block. It turns out that Quaid is in fact Hauser, a spy who has become a double agent working for the downtrodden on Mars. Or is he, because as Quaid/Hauser proceeds through his adventure he is constantly approached by his wife and a psychiatrist claiming that none of what he is experiencing is actually real and he is in fact trapped in the memory implant vacation he signed on for. What is real or not is left to the viewer and the story taken for itself alone is satisfying, standard sci-fi adventure.

Even the visuals, while a little dated with their candy-colored neon colors and lighting works far better than I remembered and is in fact visually arresting. The acting is solid and fun if not spectacular and the pacing and editing are good. All in all a highly recommended sci-fi adventure to while away an afternoon or evening in a pleasant way and good enough to be a minor classic.",1355702400,,1999,4.519337016574585

I own two DVD versions and the 2008 Blu-Ray release.  Playing this one side by side on my 1080i TV, does not look any better than the 4 year ago release.  Maybe I need a 1080p or better (faster refresh??) TV.  My TV is 4 years old.

What this version had is a plethora of behind the scenes and interviews that was not on the earlier Blu-Ray.  The Deluxe DVD of 2002 had the extra material but it was nice watching it again.

Sort of felt a bit cheated buying this but at $10, OK.  So, unless you have a really nice HD TV and the best Blu-Ray player on the market, you'll not see much improvement.

I do rate this movie one of my TOP 10 movies!  So that is why I have bought it again and again and again.  I'll probably buy it in ""Extreme-Ultra-Blu-Ray"" when it comes out in 2015!!

If you're an Arnold fan you already the movie is a great action film.

The blu-ray edition is very ""grainy"". the picture quality for a blu-ray is just not very good.

If I compare it to a TV program like Fringe, Total Recall loses: big time.

73848,5,0784010331,"After watching the 2012 remake of this film (or rather, re-adaptation from the same story) in theaters and being dissapointed and almost bored to sleep, I felt the itch to watch the Arnie film, which I hadn't watched in years but I remembered as fun.  I wanted to know if watching it again was going to bore me too, since maybe I just liked it out of nostalgia.  Rather than rent it, I bought this Blu Ray on a whim and was absolutely and thoroughly pleased.  Not only this movie holds up wonderfully, being as good as it was back then and several magnitudes better than the new film with the same name, the quality of the Blu Ray transfer is really good.  Granted, I've seen movies with better transfers, but this one is still quite nice.

The special effects of the new film don't have a candle to hold against the ones on this movie.  Even though it's easier now to see rubber and puppets for what they really are than it was back then, they still look spectacular, and much more realistic than the CGI in the new one.  The script is better and more interesting, and the action is far more well realized and engaging.  Also, the classic Arnie quips and catchphrases come back with a vengeance here, and are just as fun to listen to as they always were.

If you think action movies these days are just not as good as they used to, this is the evidence you were looking for.  Don't bother with the new adaptation.  Even if you want to compare them, rather than watch this one and the new one, watch this one twice.  You won't regret it.",1347926400,4,1537,4.317073170731708

73871,4,0784010331,"Previous releases of Total Recall have had issues regarding video quality. As best as can be given the source material the new ""Mind-Bending Edition"" corrects these problems. Film grain is sometimes visible, but is never oppressive or annoying. This kind of ""noise"" is endemic to a film shot on actual film, 20 years ago. To completely remove ALL such noise would mean to blur the actual picture, which would make Arnold look like a wax statue. This edition, IMO, has the right balance of noise reduction/clean-up balanced with detail preservation.

Increasing the sharpness, contrast, and color levels of the source material (as they have to glorious effect) can add new ""noise"" (each of their own sort). But the new release serves as a great balance between strong, sharp, rich colors and blacks and noise reduction/clean-up without losing detail.

An updated or new commentary track,maybe from writers or FX guys would have been nice (the Verhoven/Schwarzenegger track is from a 2000 release), but there are lots of extras considering the price of the blu-ray albeit many are vintage.",1346371200,3,1087,5.135593220338983

73876,5,0784010331,"This new blu ray transfer is great! Way better than the original blu ray in many ways, first of all this version was supervised by Paul Verhoeven and it's obvious that the new transfer had a lot of care put into it regarding the color pallet and the emergence of fine detail. Literally the scenes look more convincing than on the DVD or original Blu Ray thanks to the new cleaned up image revealing the lighting scheme and colors the way they were meant to be seen. There are quite a few special features on the disc, and the interface is simplified with fast moving simple menu options and an animated main menu. The special features include a making of, a recent interview on the film making process with director Paul Verhoeven, audio commentary, a special effects making of, stills, and a somewhat exaggerated cleanup comparison. The comparison is sort of unbelievable as the source film stock looks terrible, it's so bad it's too good to be true, in the manner that it tries way too hard to justify this blu ray's existence, I mean it looks like someone just fed the film through a computer and upped the contrast to extreme levels and put a blue hue over everything, and some sort of dnr that wiped out the fine detail. I'm not sure how trustworthy the comparison is, but it's irrelevant because this blu ray really is worth buying, even if you have the original BD (note: this comparison is made between the allegedly unaltered source material and this new Blu Ray's image, not a comparison between this new BD and the old one, or this new BD and the DVD). The level of fine detail is way higher than the first BD, and like I said before the color pallet is larger and the lighting makes the movie feel a little newer. It sort of feels like this is what it was supposed to look like in the first place. Also for all of you wondering, the director did not go back and add anything using CG, like old George Lucas has in the last ten years, so it is unaltered but cleaned up, and definitely worth the 9 bucks I paid for it, heads and tails above the original blu ray, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed this film in the first place, or has it on any other format.",1345507200,4,2178,4.380246913580247

Let's travel back to July of 1990 when a new science fiction adventure movie was released that seemed to capture everybody's attention, back when a guy's movie meant a man's movie and you had to wait six months or longer for it to arrive home on VHS or laserdisc. But you won't need a time machine, just a newfangled DVD or Blu-ray player and get your hands on the 1990 version of Total Recall. Starring a never better and still in his prime Arnold Schwarzenegger, who here gives closer to a real performance than anyone was used to. No less than Roger Ebert praised big Arnold for his acting in this one. From Dutch director Paul Verhoeven, who was fresh off the equally great RoboCop and a string of excellent films from his native homeland, Soldier of Orange being the best.

This is what action movies seriously are all about. Featuring an array of then stunning visual effects, now perhaps gloriously out dated. Rubber monsters and miniatures are used courtesy of the legendary Rob Bottin, the kind of stuff some of us have never gotten over. In a gorephically violent over the top manner, that is nothing like what is to be found in the watered down contemporary PG-13 rated action pictures, so extreme in fact that the movie had to be cut to avoid an X-rating.

To say I can't get enough of Total Recall would be an understatement. And I'm not alone, the movie was a huge blockbuster in it's time, now a cult classic, based in part on a short story by Blade Runner author Philip K. Dick. The picture earned critical praise and audience adulation becoming one of the corner stones of the then booming action film.

Today, along with the Terminator movies and Predator, this is one of Schwarzenegger's most recognizable and beloved movies.  Set in 2084, and using a totally original look at the familiar genre clichs. It's easy to see why audiences flocked to this, and why so many are still singing it's praises.  With exceptionally filmed action scenes, a sly sense of humor, and an unexpected ambiguous ending.  This wasn't just a run of the mill action picture, even in it`s day.

Not like so many of today's movies that are overflowing with just too much CGI, weak storytelling and dull characters. Why a remake know, after a mere twenty-two years, well I would guess because this never had the opportunity to became a franchise, despite long standing rumors of a sequel, that the producers could milk for future dollars. With no sense of history, many audiences will most likely never see, or even if they did see, be able to enjoy the quant pleasures of this genre classic. A different kind of beast than they are used too, something more mythical, perhaps.

I don't want to get preachy here, we are all entitled to like what we like, but for many of us the good old days are really over for good, but a classic never goes out of style.",1345420800,2,3100,4.5913200723327305

No plot spoilers from me: the story is set in 2084 and follows Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker that dreams of visiting Mars. The future has some interesting technology, including the ability plant memories directly into a person's brain and the ""Rekall"" company specializes in implanting vacation and adventure experiences for those that can't afford the money or time to take real ones. Quaid decides that this is the only answer to deal with his rising mars obsession and things don't go quite as planned from there.

The acting was decent for this type of movie and also stared Sharon Stone as Quaid's wife and Rachel Ticotin as the love interest. The special effects range from just plain bad to very good and the science is often just plain wrong or highly questionable in places, but this is an action movie and it all works for the most part.

This was a fun movie that is very watchable.

This is so much better than the old DVD release!  However, there is still some grain present in most of the scenes and it's just not crystal clear so that's why it's getting 4 stars instead of 5.  I've also experienced zero audio problems as another reviewer has mentioned, although there isn't much for surround sound - it's mostly just stereo.  Also, you should know that you don't get any extras with this, like you do with the physical blu-ray disc, so if you want those, order the disc instead.

Lion Gate's 2012 Blu-ray release looks fine and I have no issues with this product.

If you have never seen Arnold Schwarzenegger's version of ""Total Recall"", there are two things you should know.  Firstly, it is great science fiction.  It delves into the question of just who are we?  Are we the sum of our memories?  In ""Total Recall"" someone has replaced the memories of the main character, who believes himself to be a man named Quaid;  he still has the same skills, but his personality is different.

Secondly, you should know this is a violent movie;  how violent?  There are many scenes in which you could use the words: blood, bullets, and breaking glass in their descriptions.  I counted 17 violent scenes, 16 which involve gunfire and one scene where death was meted out with sharp pieces of equipment and a fire axe.

In spite of the violence, it is a well done action-movie, so riveting, so fast paced, that there is no time to get another popcorn. . . .

The first Blu-Ray release was just awful.  It had about the worst video quality of any Blu-Ray I've seen.  I really like this movie, but just didn't want to watch it again on the Blu-Ray I had.  It was a waste of money.  They should have refunded our money.

This ""Mind Bending"" edition, is greatly improved.  I only noticed some slight grain in a few of the scenes, whereas the first issue was overwhelmed with grain.  Video quality is not perfect, but I give it an 8.5 on a 10.0 scale.  I am very happy I bought this new release, and will watch it again sometime.

The audio was not that impressive though.  It had some sub-woofer bass, but almost no noticable surround sound.",1344643200,4,892,4.528301886792453
73886,5,0784010331,"When Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in Paul Verhoeven's ""Total Recall"" in 1990, he was at the peak of his career as a Hollywood action icon. While many of the entries in Arnold's oeuvre are thinly-plotted, absurdly over-the-top affairs, Verhoeven's intelligence and proclivity for satire (see also: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robocop/dp/B000VD5I94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robocop</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Troopers/dp/B000UAFDP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Troopers</a>"") and a finely-honed screenplay allowed both director and star to create an action film that works on multiple levels -- literally, a fun, ultraviolent romp about a secret agent saving Mars, but laced with the ambiguity that it all may or may not be happening in the main character's head, staying true to the thematic concerns of Philip K. Dick's literary source material.

Despite being a global smash hit, ""Total Recall"" has previously only been available on Blu-ray in the US with a recycled, smeared transfer that in no way does the film justice and only a short featurette as the sole extra. Fortunately, Lionsgate has finally remedied this by coinciding the release of this ""Mind-Bending Edition"" with the theatrical debut of the remake.

The video transfer is absolutely filmic in appearance, with vivid colors and fine grain and detail throughout. I have read complaints that the picture is too bright, preventing true blacks, and there were several instances where I thought noticed such an effect, but honestly I wasn't too bothered. The film is over 20 years old and one of the last to feature extensive optically-composited effects; it can't and won't look like Avatar, although for its age the presentation is quite impressive. Approved by Verhoeven himself, this transfer is undoubtedly the best the film has looked in quite some time.

Sound is about par for a film of this type and age. The track isn't reference quality, but there is some nice directionality and a good bite to the gunfire, explosions, and bone-snapping action.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jerry-Goldsmith-s-score/dp/B000053GUJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jerry Goldsmith's score</a>, one of his very best, sounds wonderful.

We also are finally presented with a fine assortment of extra material. The fast, informative, and funny commentary by Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger that was featured on the DVD Special Edition is now included, as is a vintage EPK-documentary and a making-of from the DVD. New features include a half-hour interview (in HD!) with Paul Verhoeven that is refreshingly frank and honest, as well as a twenty-minute look into the creation of the film's miniature and early-CGI special effects. A photo gallery, restoration comparison, and SD trailer round out the supplements.

In summary, this new Blu-ray is a fine edition of ""Total Recall"" that is greatly superior to the previous Blu release and is absolutely worthy of a purchase, whether as a double-dip or for the first time.",1344556800,,3117,5.917777777777777

73893,3,0784010331,"To coincide with the release of the 2012 remake, ""Total Recall"" has been resurrected on Blu-Ray from Lionsgate in the form of a ""Mind Bending"" Special Edition re-issue. The studio's original Blu-Ray was a poor, early-format effort, and this new AVC encoded 1080p transfer is a huge upgrade by comparison, even though the film itself doesn't appear flawless (with all the optical effects, it's no surprise that there's something of a slightly ""dirty"" aspect to the entire transfer). That said, the lack of DNR is quite welcome and the overall look hugely satisfying, with the transfer closely resembling Studio Canal's superior European Blu-Ray releases of the film (in fact it seems to be a new encoding of that older master). The DTS MA audio nicely represents Goldsmith's score, while extras - none of which were contained on the prior Blu-Ray - are rounded up from Lionsgate's old DVD releases.

These include a chatty Verhoeven-Schwarzenegger commentary, which is wide-ranging and most interesting when it divulges the rocky development of the film, particularly the Bruce Beresford-directed version that was days away from shooting with star Patrick Swayze before DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group went under. There's also talk about the proposed ""Total Recall 2"" sequel that was supposed to adapt ""Minority Report,"" while an interview with Verhoeven, 2001 ""Imaging `Total Recall'"" and special effects documentaries, the trailer, a photo gallery, and a restoration comparison round out a fine budget-priced Blu-Ray that's unquestionably better than the release that preceded it.",1343865600,18,1582,5.457142857142857

73895,3,0784010331,"I don't review often, but I felt the need to in this case.  This is one of the rare times I've really had a hard time distinguishing between my prior high-bitrate DVD and a Blu-ray.  Yeah, it's a little sharper, but nothing that makes you think ""WOW! Now THIS is HD!""  Part of that, I'd have to attribute to the original film.  This is a movie I saw five times--my personal best, ever--in the theater, and I do remember that the print seemed a bit grainy, like the film stock they'd used wasn't all that spectacular.  I do support the natural treatment of film, though, so I'm glad they didn't attempt to sharpen the film and use DNR to give it that glossy, HD look.

Overall, it's worth the $10 you'd pay for it.  The commentary track is from one of the old DVD's and fully illustrates that Arnold is perhaps one of the funniest, and worst, celebrity commentators ever.  He simply doesn't understand what's expected of him.  Verhoeven, however, is terrific both in the commentary and the supplementary interview, which was clearly filmed more recently and in HD.

Overall, I gave the Bluray three stars.  The film itself I give four and a half, but I think the reviews should be more about the quality of the disc than about what you thought of the film.  (That's what Rottentomatoes is for.)",1343779200,12,1293,4.525862068965517

This actually makes it a bit more entertaining.  That being said, the story behind this is very interesting, and this film makes for some good Saturday afternoon entertainment.

This film is a classic in the sci-fi genre for good reason, the premise is so interesting, and the delivery unique.

73899,3,0784010331,"Total Recall is one of the last 1980s movies that filled itself with the new special effects that were being developed quickly yet with gratuitous amounts of explosions and cheesy writing and acting. However, all of that is wrapped up in a much more interesting and unique premise. This is also one of the last Scwarzengger films were he wasn't being played up exclusively as the big tough guy with a funny accent (save for T2). So all in all, this certainly is a big dumb movie, but it's one of the best big dumb movies ever.

However, this Blu-Ray release here is downright weak. The point of Blu-Ray for movies is to be a giant disc that holds terrific audio/video quality and a massive amount of special features. All of which this release fails on. This is one of the early Blu-ray releases, where big movie companies seemed to just throw out all their movies they could find with little thought in order to get a buck from all the people looking to see their favorite movies in high-def.

-There is essentially no extras included. There's an annoying little advertisement for other Blu-ray releases from LionGate, and a condescendingly pointless 5 minute long documentary on Mars(the setting of the film).

-The video quality is particularly bad. It may be 1080p, but there is no clarity whatsoever, there's plenty of film grain everywhere which can be distracting on a large television. Colors and shades are muted to the point that background details are hard to tell what they are. All of this doesn't come close to ruining the movie being that it was never meant to look very good in the first place, but it's still annoying. That pointless sole extra is in 480p. The audio quality is pretty boring, while everything is clear enough there is essentially no excitement put into it.

-The packaging is simple yet decent. Surprisingly no advertisements thrown in the case. I found it amusing that the back of the case lists interactive menus as an extra. I do like the silver reflective look on the front and spine of the case that gives it that look shiny-rainbow look.

Overall, even though this is a great movie there's no reason to buy this release, even for the $10 or less price tags I've seen on some of these in stores. The newly released Total Recall (Mind-Bending Edition) [Blu-ray] has a superb transfer, and a good selection of extras (including a full commentary with Arnold and Verhoeven).",1343520000,,2410,4.714964370546318
73900,5,0784010331,"This is Arnold's best movie of all time, with Commando coming in at 2nd place. This is actually my favourite movie of all time. It has everything; romance, betrayal, mystery, action, mutants with three boobs...etc. There is something in it for everybody. For those of you who say Arnold can't act, you are completely wrong, as this movie is perfect evidence to his acting skills. Sharon Stone is awesome in this movie. It leaves you guessing the whole movie. Is it really happening or is this all just because he has a skitzoid embolism (sorry about the spelling)? The other actors in the movie are all awesome. For those of you who say the effects are poor. GET OVER IT. It was 1990 okay? Vilos Cohaagon is a fantastic character. You may recognize him from Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2. This movie is so exciting, you never know what is going to happen next. Arnold just basically kicks ass throughout this whole movie. It has a billion quotable lines throughout the whole movie. Honestly, I cannot think of a single thing that I don't like about this movie. Everything about it is awesome. If you haven't seen this movie, you really need to watch it. It is for every age too! You don't have to be someone that grew up when Arnold was making his movies. I am a 24 year old female, and I love Arnold more than any other actor of all time. I find all of his movies relatable and awesome, this taking the top spot. Give this movie a chance. You will not regret it! I promise you this. I could listen to Arnold pronounce Mars as Mahz all day, every day. I am sorry if this is a bad review, it is my first one. But again, this is the best movie of all time. I am jealous of the other person who wrote a review saying they worked on the set, because I feel like nothing can compare to this movie and everybody who got to work on this movie should consider themselves lucky!!

Additionally, this film possesses one of the most sophisticated plots of any science fiction film, and, along with superb acting by all hands, and an intriguing score by Jerry Goldsmith, it makes for a very satisfying experience.

Sound is good for the most part as well, there are some momentary issues, like the very first moment Quaid meets the Recall guy the sound (for about 4 seconds) seems very tinny, but overall that it sounds very good.  There are a good amount of extras as well.

73907,1,0784010331,"This horrible product, with its two manufacturer defects, was twice pulled off the market by Amazon.  I'm the stubborn customer responsible for making enough fuss to produce that earlier black on yellow, rectangular box, headed by ""Item Under Review"".

It unfortunately took over 5 years, since the first known Blu-ray review getting this right, second from the top, left side, declared: ""Disappointing Transfer February 15, 2007"".  And now it's back up for sale again.

Amazon seems to believe all defects were cured/irrelevant, despite plenty of scathing customer reviews.

Since Amazon never will watch a ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray, it's hard to avoid being cynical.  The pair of best Amazon customer service representatives I've talked with cannot even agree over what happens to an ""Item Under Review"".  One thinks a defective ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray is watched by Amazon at a ""fulfillment center"".  He fails to realize that's a fairy tale.

The other Amazon person claims as follows:

""we do notify the manufacturer about any issues in regards to products when being reported in multiple instances. This is to ensure that we are able to get corrected merchandise if this is something the manufacture can deliver. In some instances we return inventory if the product is unable to be corrected.""

That's not what really happens either, in my opinion.

First the two Amazon representatives directly contradict each other, nothing new.  The ""Amazon Rule Against Direct Contact With Customers"" means I'm always speaking with somebody new, and can't easily get back to anyone.  So I hear endless contradictions from Amazon people.  At one point I believed nothing said by Amazon, errors due to negligence, guesswork, and poor training, rather than being intentionally deceptive.

I conclude that, since no manufacturer turning out such horrible Blu-rays like ""Total Recall"" cares to do anything about it, while Amazon is no better, the only truth is failure to watch any defective DVD.  Thus, neither Amazon nor the manufacturer are concerned about continuing to sell ""Total Recall"", despite it being fatally defective.  So after a certain number of days elapse, with zero progress, no defective DVD/Blu-ray having been watched by ANYONE, an ""Item Under Review"" automatically goes back on sale by Amazon.  Only a theory, but it fits the facts.

Of course nothing ever changes regarding more than 5 years of Amazon continuing to sell this awful ""alleged"" Blu-ray.

The defects remain:

1. The alleged ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray disc, falsely advertised by the manufacturer as in a Cinemascope screen aspect ratio of 2.35:1, is actually at 1.85:1.

2. Despite being falsely advertised by the manufacturer as in ""High Definition"", the alleged ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray is in standard definition at best.

Consumers must never give up.  If you receive a defective product, complain to any retailer.  (Also note that great ""Total Recall"" Blu-rays do exist, as reviewed by specialty websites.)  A pity Amazon seems to have never received those from the manufacturer.

You may ask: How could all this continue over five years, with Amazon selling fatally defective ""Total Recall"" Blu-rays?

It's easy to explain.  First Amazon people normally never read customer written reviews, believing they are only for customers.  Second, Amazon fails to clearly place reviews in two entirely separate categories, one category for ordinary standard definition DVDs, the other category for Blu-ray High Definition DVDs.

My suggestion to Amazon that this helpful division become standard policy is at least under consideration, or so I have been told.  I once again urge Amazon to begin doing what makes sense for both Amazon and its customers.  Blu-rays have close to nothing in common with standard definition DVDs.  Separate the reviews, starting with brand new Blu-ray releases.

Had all ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray reviews been collected under a single heading, even Amazon might have noticed that nearly every single Blu-ray review complained about one or both of the two defects I've described above.  At least fewer of us consumers, who read the reviews, would have purchased such an absurd product.

Truth is that extremely helpful Amazon personnel finally read those highly negative ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray reviews.  It happened because I politely asked them to become better educated by such reading, also guiding their way to the most incriminating Blu-ray ""Total Recall"" reviews.  Putting it another way, I was a pest, not just about the alleged ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray, but also two more discs purchased by me, suffering from similar manufacturer defects.  They are a Judy Collins standard definition concert DVD with stall/skips in two songs; and""Superman II - the Richard Donner Cut"", not in high definition.

Amazon needs to be educated on such matters by its customers.  It's up to us.

And good Amazon DVD/Blu-ray consumers MUST understand Amazon's binding ""Rule of 2"".  Any Amazon DVD or Blu-ray purchaser has to receive TWO different discs with the same defect, FROM AMAZON.COM, before ever being taken seriously.  And Amazon means two separate discs of the exact same product, purchased only from Amazon.com, a first one replaced by the second one, with the identical defect a second time.  Most importantly, defective DVD/Blu-rays purchased from Amazon Marketplace sellers NEVER count under the ""Rule of 2"".

You may ask: How am I supposed to know about this ""Rule of 2"" that excludes Amazon Marketplace sellers?

I'm telling you now, exactly how some Amazon people explained it to me.  Always obey the ""Rule of 2"", and that means ignoring Amazon customer service representatives who themselves fail to understand the ""Rule of 2"".  Those well-meaning people only got in the way, greatly delaying my compliance with the ""Rule of 2"", the secret to any hope for success.  Consumers must know more than many Amazon people they talk to.  I'm also assuming we want such products with manufacturer defects to promptly become an ""Item Under Review"", even if it currently gets us nowhere.  I intend for that to change.

Of course I don't agree with the ""Rule of 2"", and plenty of other Amazon rules.  So long as Amazon follows its ""Rule of 2, then Amazon should prominently display the ""Rule of 2"" everywhere it sells DVDs and Blu-rays, also training and testing every customer service representative as to their knowledge regarding the ""Rule of 2"".  I also oppose Amazon excluding purchases from Amazon Marketplace sellers as never having happened under the ""Rule of 2"".  I got four separate,  standard definition DVDs of Judy Collins, all with the exact same manufacturer defect in the same two songs, but purchases #1 and #2 failed to count under the ""Rule of 2"", the result of trying to save a little money buying from Marketplace sellers cheaper than Amazon.

You may ask: How does Amazon handle the kind of manufacturer defects you keep talking about, such as the defective ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray?

I intend to learn, starting with an inquiry about whether ""Total Recall"" Blu-rays put up for sale yet again have ever been watched by anyone from Amazon and/or the manufacturer.  This is the fundamental question, and I currently know that ""none"" remains the only possible answer.  Just want Amazon to admit this fact, then hopefully changing its ""Rule Against Amazon Personnel Ever Watching a Defective DVD/Blu-ray.""

Wish me luck, since I am gong to need it.",1335312000,15,7440,5.168060200668896
73908,5,0784010331,"Total Recall is a cinematic classic that bookends both the end of the iconic 1980s muscle action hero and the end of traditional movie effects before the takeover by CGI. I must have seen this 30 times over years - a strong, well-paced script rips the audience through the basic setup quickly before sending us on exactly the ride that Quaid paid for at Recall.

In a story that has really nothing to do with Philip K Dick's original, it does manage to pack in enough science fiction elements without collapsing under the weight of its own ludicrousness. The script leans heavily towards suggesting it was all a dream so almost anything far-fetched can be explained from this angle.

In traditional Paul Verhoeven style, it offers a level of violence that makes most horror films look like children's TV, and in the DVD extras he gleefully  justifies it quite convincingly. The in-camera special effects are what really gives this film its unique look - the clever animatronics, well designed models and sets all combine to create a mutant-filled Mars that looks great on camera. Although I'm sure 2012's remake will all be CGI, it will lose some of its charm as a result.

Total Recall also had a near-perfect cast. Sharon Stone shines as his double-agent wife, Rachael Ticotin is a great love interest, and Michael Ironside bellows his way through as the psychotic Richter. Even Ronny Cox is perfect playing pretty much the same character from Verhoeven's Robocop. It's a really a classic in so many respects.

As an aside, it's interesting which technologies in this film have become a reality, from the 3D body scanners to the location tracking on a handheld device.

I really like the action sequences because they used sets, models and makeup effects - the old school filming techniques to create the effects which is something I appreciate. The plot is very engaging considering we don't really get great sci-fi stories.

As for Blu-ray, I was very disappointed as many others on this board. I didn't own the standard DVD so I took my chance and bought the Blu-ray. I own hundreds of Blu-ray titles from many different eras (50s thru 2000s) and I can honestly say they didn't do anything to improve true Blu-ray experience. Colors are very dull, contrast is awful, some scenes are very grainy almost like regular DVD quality.

This movie really deserves a better Blu-ray treatment. It's a shame that the production company didn't give this movie proper treatment it deserves. If you own the DVD, don't bother buying the Blu-ray until a better edition comes along.",1330992000,5,1000,4.876470588235295

73912,5,0784010331,"I first watched Total Recall on a premium channel (probably HBO) back in late 1993/early 1994 and thought it was awesome, and like all prime movies, they get better the older you get.  When it comes to Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies, people seem to think that the first two Terminator movies and possibly Predator are his best, and while I think all of them are fantastic flicks, I personally think Total Recall is Arnie's best movie.

STORY

In the year 2084, a man named Doug Quaid has recurring dreams about Mars and a beautiful brunette.  Doug, despite going against his wife's wishes, visits Rekall, a company that specializes in creating artificial vacations for customers by implanting memories made according to the customer's wishes.  When Doug requests being a secret agent on Mars, a thrilling, twisting action ride follows, blurring the line between fantasy and reality.  On the way, Doug learns that he's an agent from the other side, whose turned after finding out he's fighting for the wrong team.

CHARACTERS

While the characters aren't intellectual masterpieces, they're all very well-sculpted, and fit the movie like a glove.  With Schwarzenegger being the star of the show, he's perfect as Quaid/Hauser.  As an action hero, Quaid is a fine balance between being a skilled combatant and a human.  This is so because in many of the scenes, he's cutting through enemies like soft butter, but in others, he does get injured and is compromised in some ways.  This is an important trait for action stars because if there's no tension, it gets boring really fast.  Also, with Arnold being Arnold, he dishes out one-liners that only he can spew with such charm.

The supporting cast is also really solid.  Sharon Stone is great as Lori Quaid, a sexy undercover agent posing as Doug's wife.  Rachel Ticotin plays the role as Melina really well, a sexy brunette that's in Quaid's past dreams and in the ""real part"" of the movie, whose a prostitute and an undercover resistance fighter against Vilos Cohaagan (Ronny Cox) and his oppressive rule over the red planet.  Cox is a master as the vile Cohaagan, since he's such a charismatic yet despicable man who'll do anything to maintain control of Mars, even if it means cutting off air supply to the mutant population.  Michael Ironside is great as Richter, Cohaagan's lead henchman hell-bent on killing Quaid, and Mel Johnson Jr. is a blast as Benny, a humorous cabbie on Mars helping Quaid on his adventure (but his true motives are hazy).

PLOTTING

With Total Recall being a sci-fi action film, and that it's about blending fantasy with reality, the plotting for this movie is superb.  Towards the beginning, Quaid goes to Rekall to get memories of a Mars vacation implanted into his mind, the doctor explains to Quaid what the basic outline of his simulated vacation will be like, and when the memory implants begin, the audience is twisted into thinking either the implant didn't work and Quaid is having a psychotic reaction to the implant, or that it's all part of the simulation he paid for.  Along the way, there's a good deal of twists with characters and the storyline that are too good to spoil, but I'll assure you that it's really well-done.

THEMES

While Total Recall's main theme is blending fantasy and reality, which is a very ubiquitous theme in many different types of fiction, it's still very unique because it's intertwined with interesting ideas like the question of simulated memories being better than actually living out such desires.  Also, while not totally groundbreaking, the fact that a blonde woman (Lori) is evil while a brunette woman (Rachel) is good, is a neat reversal of the common idea of light representing good and the dark representing evil.

SPECIAL EFFECTS

With Total Recall being an action film from 1990 (though it retains a very 80's feel to it, since it was made in the very late 80's), there's some special effects that show their age, but thankfully, this aging doesn't really detriment enjoyability of the movie.  For example, the effects of lightning bolts and some 3D rendered imagery displayed in the TV screens in the movie's universe are pretty aged, but thanks to the talent of skilled special effects artist Rob Bottin (whose credits also include the previous Paul Verhoeven movie Robocop and the John Carpenter masterpiece The Thing), the visual effects for the mutants are very well-done.  The visuals of the Martian landscape are also really good for a movie made before mass usage of CGI.

VISUAL STYLE

Also, with this movie being a futuristic movie made in the late 80's, the ideas of what future technology show their age as well, since vehicles look very angular, mass usage of tapes for electronic devices, guns retain their basic functions and haven't advanced so much as they changed in how they look, and TV/computer screens are all CRT display devices.  I'm honestly not bothered by this because hardly anyone back then could imagine the rapid advancements in technology that we're so used to today, and it gives character to the movie.  The only thing I found to be pretty goofy-looking was the Johnny Cab, which the robot cabbie inside the cab looks like an invention of the 50's and 60's, but they're not seen past the firs third of the movie, and even in the first third, they're not dominant in the picture.  Fashion senses are also cemented in the 80's.  There's a scene where Lori is working out to an aerobics hologram, and she looks like an aerobics instructor from 1985, and not to mention that so many of the women in this movie have the ""big"" hair the 80's is famed for (along with a good deal of 80's clothing to boot).

COMPARISON WITH LITERARY SOURCE

Since this is one of those rare instances where I've watched a movie and read the book that it's inspired by, I'll talk about how it differs from the source material.  In the Philip K. Dick short story We Can Remember it for You Wholesale, the story is much more focused on the idea of whether simulated memories are better than the real thing, and blending fantasy with reality.  With Total Recall, it takes the core premise of the source material and remodels it as a feature-length action movie while still making it a solid brain-twister.  I have no problem with this because when both materials are evaluated, both are great in their own rights.

SOUNDTRACK

Jerry Goldsmith struck gold with the movie's soundtrack.  The main theme of the movie really gets me going, and the other tracks for differing moods are top notch.  While not a part of the official soundtrack, the music played in the Last Resort club reminds me a lot of the music from the classic Sonic the Hedgehog games (and this is a good thing by me).  All in all, the music here is gold.

ACTION SCENES

What's an action movie without any great action scenes?  Fortunately for us, Total Recall has great action scenes aplenty.  There's some cool fighting choreography between Lori and Melina, and lots of stellar gun fights throughout.  One of the more notable is towards the beginning, when Cohaagan's henchmen are chasing Quaid in the subway, the bad guys try to gun him down, but end up killing a bystander.  Quaid just takes the dead guy and uses him as a ""meat shield"" when he blows away the bad guys.  When the people in the Last Resort crowd end up fighting with Cohaagan's security forces, you even see a midget prostitute stab one of the bad guys with a large knife and mow down some baddies with a machine gun.  Now that's something you don't see everyday!!

MATURE CONTENT

This movie is certainly one not for the kids because there's A LOT of brutal violence and some nudity/sexual imagery depicted, including the bare chest of a three-breasted female prostitute.  There's a lot of blood shed in the gun fights, and even some fight scenes are more brutal than others.  No joking, some bad guys get killed by having sharp objects impaled through their heads and even one is unfortunate enough to be slain with a hand-held mining drill.

FINAL WORD

Total Recall is a masterpiece as an action film and a sci-fi film.  It's both Schwarzenegger's best movie and Paul Verhoeven's best movie, and if you love action films that manage to be both intelligent and fun, then this is mandatory viewing.",1324598400,5,8272,4.779732582688248

73927,4,0784010331,"A clever Arnie science fiction thriller ""Total Recall"" maintains the over-the-top vibe of Paul Verhoven's (""Robocop"", ""Basic Instinct"", ""Starship Troopers"", ""Showgirls"")other American films; the films feature an absurd almost pornographic level of violence, tongue-in-cheek humor and a clever plot twist.

The story for the five people who haven't seen it is based on Phil Dick's (Dick wrote the novels that were adapted into the films ""Blade Runner"", ""A Scanner Darkly"" and has had numerous stories turned into films)story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"", features Arnie as construction worker Doug Quaid who feels like something is missing in his life. Against his wife's (Sharon Stone) advice Quaid goes to REKALL a company that specalizes in memory implant vacations. Quaid elects the Martian vacation package where he'll be an undercover operative helping to liberate the Mars colony. There's one hitch--it turns out that Quaid MAY very well be the character he was going to pretend to be on vacation and that REKALL's attempt to implant the memory uncovers a suppressed one.

Ronny Cox gives a deliciously over-the-top performance as the bad guy here that rivals his slimy, evil performance in ""Robocop"". Sharon Stone isn't hard on the eyes here and Arnie gives a solid performance as Quaid (although I can imagine a VERY different film if the original star attached at one point--Richard Drefyus--had been cast and someone a bit more subtle had directed). ""Total Recall"" is a fun, loud, violent flick typical of what you'd expect from Arnie and from the 1990's but this version, well, it looks pretty awful.

Update for 2012 Edition:

The ""Mind-Bending Edition"" is a marked improvement over the original subpart Blu-ray release. The image quality improves with a sharper, more detailed picture. Having said that, the effects sequence have a softer quality to them which is not atypical for a film from the 80's using pre-CGI visual effects. The color is also improved here but I seem to remember the film having bolder colors in theaters although I should note that it's been a long, long time since I saw this in theaters and that memory may be ""colored"" by seeing it on television with boosted color values that weren't part of the original presentation.

This edition features an often amusing commentary track (Arnie's habit of describing the action isn't as annoying as it might appear to be at first listen--it actually is quite amusing to hear him describe the action at times on the screen)while director Verhoeven's commentary track is pretty good although far less animated than, say, ""Starship Troopers"" or ""Showgirls"".

We get a ""making of"" featurette as well as a restoration comparison, stills gallery and the original trailer. Compared to the previous edition, this version is positively filled to the brim with special features. We also get featurettes on the various effects in the film while the only one missing that I can think of is on the production history of the film (this is one of two projects that the late Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett were working on at the same time--the other one was ""Alien"").

I'd recommend this new edition (the review for the previous version is below).

PREVIOUS EDITION (2006):

I'm saddened to report that this is one of the worst Blu-ray transfers I've ever seen; Lion's Gate's version looks like it was upscaled from a standard DVD or pulled from the same regular definition source. The film looks soft with fine detail often lost in the murky looking Blu-ray disc.

I'd recommend skipping this edition which even for $9 (amazon's price when I wrote this review) isn't worth it. It's ugly looking. Wait until Lion's Gate elects to upgrade this with a better looking transfer from a better source or go for the UK edition which looks better than this pathetic excuse for a Blu-ray.

73934,3,0784010331,"This one was a waste of money.  It's no better than the DVD.  I promise you.  This realization is both good news and bad news for me.  The bad news is that I expected it to look alot better than it does as a Blu-Ray disc.  The good news is that I really don't think that I will have to replace many of my regular DVD's that I already feel look very good as they are.  So, I'm going to be spending alot less money on replacing my DVD's than I had at first thought.

You know, my previous Samsung Progressive scan DVD player with the HDMI hook-up option, really made my old DVD's look better than my first DVD player.  So, if your DVD player has the HDMI hook-up, you're going to find that replacing your DVD's with Blu-Ray may not impress you with any serious visual improvements.  Although, I have discovered that some Blu-Ray releases have shown a greater re-mastering effort, but only because the DVD version wasn't mastered very well in the first place.  But, I've got some great looking DVD's.  I don't think it will be necessary to replace them with Blu-Ray unless they sell for maybe $10 or less.

Anyway, this is a movie that I have on DVD that I thought would probably look better on Blu-ray Hi-Definition, but it was certainly not one of the first Blu-Ray discs that I ran out to buy.  I made an expense vow that I plan to stick to.  I will only replace my absolute favorite movies (which are about 60 of my 500+ movies) at any price under $30.  But, anything else that I already have on DVD that's not incredibly fantastic, I may only buy the new Blu-ray version if it's $9.99 or less.  I have to initiate a discipline for myself so I don't go wasting my money on replacing movies that I'll just watch again, once more maybe, and then have it just sit on my DVD shelf as a part of a proud collection that may never be watched again anytime soon.

I've got a Blu-Ray player now, and I doubt I'll ever buy another regular DVD again, but, I won't go crazy replacing my regular DVD's just because a Blu-Ray version is available.

Instead, I'm reviewing the DVD, as it wasn't at all what I was expecting and I want others to know what they're getting into if they buy this.

The DVD is marketed as a super hi-fidelity transfer that reproduces the detail of the original film master as closely as possible. How do they do this? They use the entire contents of the DVD disc to hold the movie, with no bonus features or anything else on the disc. It definitely pays off -- the picture on my 50"" Panasonic plasma was super sharp, though obviously not 720p or 1080i HD quality. No visible pores on Ah-nuld's face or anything like that. But it's also better than most DVDs I've seen of older movie titles, and the 5.1 surround soundtrack was excellent as well. So in terms of movie quality, you definitely get your money's worth.

Now, it's not like this hasn't been done before. Many DVD releases today devote one disc to the entire movie so the movie quality is as high as possible. Longer movies will even be split across two discs to maintain picture and sound quality (think of the LOTR deluxe edition releases, some of the best DVDs I've ever seen). Then they put the extras on a second disc so that you have your two-disc ""special edition"" / ""collector's edition"" / ""platinum edition"" / whatever package. Examples that come to mind include most newer releases, including LOTR, Twilight, Iron Man, and more.

But this DVD is ONLY the movie -- there IS NO second disc with any bonus features at all. So you pay the same price as any other ""special edition"" DVD, but all you get is the movie. To me, this is a disappointment. The term ""special edition"" has come to mean that you get a higher quality copy of the movie along with tons of bonus materials -- interviews with cast members, making-of featurettes, alternate endings, etc. I've never seen a movie marketed as a ""special edition"" where you only get the movie (albeit in a VERY high quality transfer) and nothing else.

If you're not into the bonus features thing, then this may not matter to you and you'll be very happy. But if you're like me and enjoy watching those bonus materials, even if it's only once or twice, paying the same money for a 2-disc set and getting only one disc feels like this was some kind of bait and switch.",1264464000,4,2454,4.446666666666666

They always said that this one was not too great but acceptable.  Some how, some people rate The Terminator (first 2) discs as poor when they are not.  Total Recall is by far THE worst BD disc ever!

This one gets the same type of review as Robocop from the reviewers.  It is no wonder why these discs are $10 or less!  This is a very poor representation of Blu-Ray or even HD.  I am good at spotting resolutions with my eye and I can tell that this is not an HD master.  It has to be a 480I give or take a few lines!

This is nothing more than an upconverted picture, but upconverted DVD's look much better in most cases.  From the moment the credits roll, there is severe crushing, noise and low resolution.  The picture quality is so bad that it looks like analog cable with a damaged cord - THAT bad!  The noise (it can't be mere film grain alone) is so horrible that the film grain has noise that moves and changes colors!

The colors were bland and there was NOTHING HD about the picture in any way.  There was no 3D effect when looking at the picture.  No facial details.  No stitching in the clothing - nothing.  The sound was weak as well since it was in DTS-HD, not Master Audio.  Hey, it was one of the early BD titles.

Instead of steady re-releasing Terminators, they need to remaster this!  I avoided it out of fear of the reviews, but the reviewers were too soft on this one.  Do not get it if you are looking for HD picture.

On another note, it was weird (I know) to see so many tube TV's 100 years into the future.  Even 2001: A Space Odessy predicted flat screens.",1247097600,55,1702,4.121951219512195

73952,2,0784010331,"Total Recall had its controversy in its heyday.  Known for its violent scenes and fast paced action sequences, it was a favorite movie of mine when it first entered the theater.  It was an interesting blend of science fiction, action, and some suspense mixed in together.  One left the movie with many questions that are still being pondered to this day.  That said, the Blu Ray version is a bit of let down.

The film quality of the Blu Ray version is sub par at best, with artifacts and some noise. My Blu Ray player up scales dvd movies with better picture quality than this transfer.  I ended up having to change my picture settings to get a less noisy picture.  This version was a real downer since high definition should look better than high quality dvd transfers. While the $10 price tag (or around this price range) is attractive, if one has a previous DVD version then one should really wait for a better edition on Blu Ray.

On a side note:
This Blu Ray version of Total Recall really shows the need for accurate reviews of Blu Ray movies (instead of dvd versions).  Not all Blu Rays have good picture and sound quality and some are outright poor in these two areas.

It is an improvment over the DVD version and for ten dollars it is worth the upgrade, but I wouldn't pay more than ten for it.  No commentary, no trailers, no special treatment of any sort.  Just the standard (cheap) Blu-ray keep case and a decent but unremarkable transfer of the film and a useless 5 minute documentary about Mars.",1235088000,4,713,4.503875968992248
73955,3,0784010331,"This is not a movie review, but a review on the quality of the disc.

I have owned this on VHS, DVD and now Blu-ray. From VHS to DVD; huge improvement. I watched the first 30 minutes on DVD, then switched it out and popped in the Blu-ray, and started from the beginning. THis is what I saw. The Blu-ray doesn't have those odd little swirly artifacts you get along image edges when upconverting, and eliminating that is enough for me. But this transfer will not give you the 1080p satisfaction. It looks more like 720p, except solid colors have that annoying snow effect (they look like videotape, not solid), just like a DVD upconversion. If you have this on DVD, don't bother unless they remaster and re-release this. It's not worth the $20 ($10 isn't bad though). If you don't have this on DVD, then go ahead and pop for the Blu-ray. The DVD Special Edition has more special features than the Blu-ray, so weigh this as well.

I had never seen all of Total Recall, and as a fan of older Sci-Fi and action films, I thought the effects were fun and advanced for the time period. Despite Arnold's mediocre acting skills, I am still a fan of his films, because they're so ""over the top"" and action packed. This film from the 90's was a cool ""throwback"" for me, and I enjoyed the sound and visual effects, as well as the story line of implanted memories, vicarious living etc. The storyline has often been mimicked by movies that followed in the next decade and for historical purposes and perspective this film is interesting as its themes remain relevant. Seeing Sharon Stone in action sequences was funny but effective, and it was cool to see her in some of her earlier work.

The sound was powerful but the transfer was very dirty and there was significant noise and specs that littered the print. The colors were not as vibrant, as I had hoped, and having seen some much older films, that have been restored (Poltergeist, for instance), this older film's transfer is quite disappointing. Still the picture was clear and on a 50"" Panasonic Plasma screen, sitting about 15-20 ft back, it still was a clean/clear experience.

73968,2,0784010331,"Total Recall is certainly imaginative. I've seen it twice now, and I STILL don't understand it. I think you could watch this film a few times, and still have questions that you needed answered. But it plays with your mind, and leaves you racking your brains, wondering if what you just saw actually happened.

In my opinion, this is not Arnie's best movie. Maybe it's the character I'm not sure. And normally I love Arnie in movies. Just didn't get this one. Mind you, I don't often understand films that are based on Philip K Dick stories - does anybody? This is based on 'We'll Remember It For You Wholesale'.

Arnie plays Doug Quaid, a construction worker, who's bored with his uneventful life, but not with his nymphomaniac wife (Sharon Stone). For some reason, he's fascinated by Mars, to the extent of dreaming about it. Dreaming that he's there, with another woman. There's a way he can get a 'vacation' implanted into his memory, and with a bunch of extras - like being a secret agent for example.

Once unconscious, Quaid wakes up in a rage, claiming he's no Quaid, but a man called Hauser. (Anne of Green Gables fans, watch out in these scenes, for a character called Doctor Lull, who was played by Rosemary Dunsmore, who played Katherine Brooke in the Anne Of Green Gables sequel.) But the technicians haven't even begun to implant the vacation yet. Blacking out again, and waking up some time later, he's confused. His once loving wife is out to kill him, as well as his colleagues, and he has some unfinished business on Mars. Despite the fact he's never been there you understand.

It's from here that the film skews into a totally different plot and left me completed puzzled. A later scene involves Doctor Edgemar coming into the so called vacation to tell Quaid/Hauser that he's had a schizoid embolism back in the chair when he was getting the implant. This is quite possibly the point where I definitely started to lose the thread of the film - as well as being confused about whether Quaid was Hauser, or Hauser was Quaid, something happens in this scene (I won't give it away) which completely confused me.

In a way, it's good because it leaves the viewer to decide what actually happens. The viewer can decide whether or not the film is a dream, or a reality, whether Quaid gets lobotomised or not, whether Quaid is Quaid or Hauser etc. But for simple minds like mine, it's left totally bamboozled.

Whereas I did enjoy what I could understand of the movie, the reason I'm giving it a low rating, is because it's simply not my favourite Arnie movie.

The movie transfers well onto blu ray, and some additional scenes (more footage of Mars for example) would have looked amazing in high definition.",1219104000,,2720,4.654166666666667

73970,5,0784010331,"Total Recall is EASILY one of the funniest and most violent science fiction movies around!  It's also one of the overall best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of all time.  It's so good that I can't possibly write a review comprehensive enough; I'll just honor Arnold and Total Recall as best I can.

Arnold is married to Sharon Stone - at possibly her sexiest shortly before exploding onto the scene in Basic Instinct - but wants to go on vacation to Mars because of recurring dreams in which he cavorts with a mysterious and gorgeous brunette named Melina (Rachel Ticotin at her most delicious).  Instead, he goes to a company that does mind implants, providing retroactive vacations to various parts of the solar system.  It's just too bad that they interfere with previous government sponsored brainwashing.

Eventually he learns that he was a former agent on Mars, gets a video from himself in the past in which he tells himself to remove a spherically shaped tracking device from his own nose, despite the fact that the device is three times the circumference of a nostril.  He also tells himself, ""Git yo as* to Mahrs.""

It is on Mars where he sees the following: a mutant lady with three boobs, a knife and machine gun wielding midget hooker, oxygen-depletion that has led to horribly disfigured freaks, and a philosophical, prophetic, baby mutant that grows out of another man's chest, clearly inspired by Danny Devito in Arnold's previous movie Twins.

And the great thing is he manages to see all of this as secret agents are chasing him and trying to kill him.  One memorable scene has Arnold on a crowded escalator where he uses some poor guy as a meatshield during a gun battle, tossing his carcass aside after it's served its purpose.  It's as bloody and gory as scenes come, and a signature of the explicitly violent and/or sexual content master Paul Verhoeven.

With the mystery uncovered, and the bad guys defeated, one last bit of drama subsides as Arnold has to somehow use an alien device to unleash hell on the Mars atmosphere, delivering relief to all the planet's inhabitants.

There are a ton of groin shots, perpetual single-bullet head shots, a decapitation, and a mechanical but realistic, removable, exploding fake face/head helmet thing.  I know it sounds unlikely, but you just have to trust me.  Of course, there are several classic Arnold one-liners.  For instance, just after he executes his former pseudo-wife, Arnold deadpans, ""Consider dat a divohrce.""  The best of all one-liners is when he kills someone with a drill and yells, ""SCREW YOU!!""

If you watch this and fail to find something interesting, then you simply don't like movies.",1214697600,4,2670,4.882483370288249

I've watched my Blu-ray disc 3 times in the last week and I see nothing wrong with the image quality.  Great details, great colors, no blocking or compression artifacts.  I wonder if the reviewers who see image quality issues on their disc have the settings on their TV or DVD player set wrong, or it they just have a crummy TV.  I'm playing my disc on a PS3 into a Sony SXRD 55"" projection LCD TV.  I have everything set at 1080p/24 and my TV is set to 120Hz connected via HDMI, and the image is stunning.  Some of the reviewers here who say their Blu-ray looks like a poor transfer state that their disc has an audio commentary with Arnold or they have a metal case.  Well, my Blu-ray has NO commentary (the only extra is the ""Vision of Mars"" featurette) and it came in the standard Blu-ray case, so either they have an earlier version of Blu-ray or they're looking at a standard-def disc.  The only questionable image quality comes at the beginning of the film where the Lionsgate logo plays.  This looks like it was captured from a VHS.  But overall, the film looks great and I see a definite image quality boost above my standard-def DVD.  Total Recall is one of the better Schwarzenegger movies, especially if you like Sci-Fi stories.

I want to make it clear that I'm not one of those people who insists that all films be cleaned up and vaseline-d for the digital transfer.

73977,4,0784010331,"TOTAL RECALL is a flawed masterpiece, marred by multiple errors of aesthetic judgment and flat out absurd moments.  Nonetheless, it raises a host of wonderful questions, has a huge number of memorable moments, and is arguably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film after the first two TERMINATOR movies.

Although the story doesn't stay especially true to the Philip K. Dick short story upon which the movie was based --""We Can Remember It For You At Wholesale"" -- it does contain the endless self-referentiality found in Dick's best stories and novels.  Construction Worker Douglas Quaid (it was Quail in the short story, but the studio thought it might be viewed as a slap at then-vice president Dan Quayle goes to a virtual reality company named Rekall that provides the imprintation of fake memories of holidays.  Having had persistent dreams of Marx, he wants a holiday to Mars.  After some prodding, he agrees to pay for some extras, namely, an adventure package, in which he will feature as the hero in an espionage tale featuring resistance fighters, alien artifacts, a brunette who looks like the one who has been featuring in his dreams, and will get to save the world.  But shortly after being placed in the equipment things start going wrong because it turns out he has already had false memories implanted.  He quickly finds himself chased by the authorities before going to Mars where he meets the brunette of his dreams and with the use of alien artifacts saves the world.  Or does he?  Any viewer will be wondering along the way whether any of this is real or whether this is just his virtual adventure holiday.  The film ends with Quaid wondering whether any of this truly was real or whether it was just the programming.  And we are given no answer.

TOTAL RECALL was one of the very last important science fiction films made before the advent of CGI.  It was one of the last to employ primarily miniatures and matte paintings rather than SCI.  Even BABYLON 5 only three years later on television would use crude CGI for most of its special effects visuals.  In this way TOTAL RECALL is the end of an era.  Only a year later TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY would be released.  Many of its greatest special effects were CGI.  So in two straight films Schwarzenegger helped close one chapter of SF history and opened another.

The problem with TOTAL RECALL is that there are just too many moments that don't quite work.  The inhabitants in the mutant section of underground Mars are just too comical self-indulgently mannered to contribute much to the film.  And the animatronic rebel leader Kuato, who is inextricably attached to the body of another person, is easily one of th emost ludicrous SF creations since the original THE FLY, where at the end of the film we see a fly with the head of a screaming David Hedison, as it is about to be eaten by a spider.  There are a host of terrible little lapses in judgment like this.  The most unfortunate might be the climax of the film, as Quaid has turned on generators that will oxygenate the atmosphere of Mars.  The ludicrousness comes not from the amazingly rapid creation of a breathable atmosphere for the planet, but from their completely ignoring the fact that the surface temperature of Mars is roughing that of Antarctica in the middle of winter.  The visuals of Arnold and his female friend as they roll on the surface of Mars has to be one of the silliest sights in the history of big budget films.  In real life they wouldn't have had to worry about air pressure; they would have frozen solid in only a few seconds.

All in all, this is both a truly rewarding and an immensely frustrating film to watch.  It contains both a host of truly remarkable and utterly horrid moments.  For me the good outweighs the bad and what we see in the end is a fascinating if undeniably flawed film.",1210464000,2,3849,4.669139465875371

Not as good as a newer transfer like a transformers or across the universe but awesome nevertheless. You have to ask yourself if a little grain really bothers you considering that the resolution is incredible? The truth is the detail is ten times better then the dvd! There is grain, but it is not anything to worry about unless you are some sort of purist.

But the female that shines is Sharon Stone portraying Schwarzenegger's wife. It was this experience with director Paul Verhoeven that led to her casting in Basic Instinct (directed by Paul Verhoeven). The story is fast paced, well acted (yes) & well directed. The movie is based upon a short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" by Phillip K. Dick.

As with ""Robocop"" Verhoeven indulges in gratuitous violence and grim humour that leaves one with a slightly bad taste in the mouth.

73994,4,0784010331,"Arnie is Doug Quaid, a simple construction worker who is bored with his uneventful life and wishes to be more and to do something meaningful. He's fascinated with going to Mars and meeting the mysterious woman of his dreams (that would be Melina) despite the civil war brewing withing the colonies. His wife Lori (Sharon Stone, looking gorgeous) is appalled with all things Martian and quickly nixes that idea. The only way Quaid is going to come close to the red planet is if he takes a Rekall vacation, a company that literally offers you a 'dream' vacation memory implant. Quaid wishes to go as a secret agent and all seems well until they send him to sleep.

As soon as he's unconscious Quaid seems to wake up in a rage, claiming his name is not Quaid but Hauser. And it's not just the dream going wrong since the Rekall technicians have not even implanted the dream yet. Blacking out again and waking up in a cab, Quaid has totally no recollection of anything that has happened and is confused to find his life turned upside down. His wife and colleagues are trying to kill him, dozens of armed henchmen are after him, he seems to have acquired lethal killing skills from nowhere and he apparently has some unfinished business back on Mars, despite the fact that he's never been there. Or has he?

Once on Mars for real (or is it?) he finds himself involved with the beautiful Melina (Rachel Ticotin, even prettier than Sharon Stone), the underground resistance and battling their arch-nemesis Vilos Cohaagen, a bureaucrat who has the entire planet under his control. It seems that Hauser was Cohaagen's right hand man and left clues for the fabricated Quaid persona to topple Cohaagen's regime.

Total Recall is certainly one of Arnie's and Verhoeven's most imaginative and creative movies. The Mars town of Venusville is basically Amsterdam's Red Light District with booze, drugs and sex everywhere, the violence is so ridiculously over-the-top that one cannot help but laugh at it (despite a lot of the gorier bits being censored by the evil MPAA), the vision of the future is incongruously bleak but colorful and fanciful yet primitive. The contrasts between Earth and Mars are similar to Western and Third World comparisons.

The visual effects, if slightly dated, are simply amazing. Jerry Goldsmith's awesome score is, at once, atmospheric and action-packed. The set-pieces, especially Quaids vision of the alien furnaces, are just ludicrously entertaining and the 'is it a dream or is it real' premise puts such a wonderfully surreal twist on the whole thing. Sci-Fi has never been so outrageous. What do you expect with mad genius Dutchman directing? And I do believe that it IS real.

The BD may be missing any extras but the film looks absolutely gorgeous in 1080p and is surely one of the best-looking BDs I have seen so far. Very, very impressed indeed. Highly recommended.",1183248000,4,2891,4.855983772819473

I mean what's more original than either taking a vacation to another planet for real or taking a trip there that's only real in your mind. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a man who's obsessed with going to Mars after a bunch of weird dreams he has of him there. His wife played by Sharon Stone ""at her hottest, well next to Basic Instinct"" is jealous since he's having dreams of another woman with him. He goes to a place called Recall that can send you to certain places in your mind with an implant that Arnold decides to go to anyway.

  After he gets the implant he finds that he's not on Mars but that everyone is chasing him with guns...including his hot wife who claims she was never his wife and just playing the part. He learns that he was never who he thought he was and was really a bad guy who got his memory erased and filled in with false memories. But could it be that the implant never went wrong at Recall and that he's really just living out the fantasy of the implant. Since he did describe that he'd like the hot brunette from his dreams there and that he did ask to be a spy and well since he did wind up on Mars too.

  We never really learn which makes this movie even more fun since I waited for years for a sequel with it all either turning out to be real or not real. But really this is a perfect film without ever finding out. It's like you're experiencing all the confusion that his character has and the film feels like one great Science Fiction nightmare come to life. It has realistic and fun effects and is just great to look at even 17 years later. There's just not many films that compare to the excitement and fun that Total Recall gives you. Some might consider it a classic if it wasn't a little too over the top violent though. But even with all the violence this is one hell of a fascinating movie.",1172880000,2,1916,4.192934782608695

""Total Recall"" is definitely up there with his greatest work, ""Robocop"".  Although I don't feel it quite hits the classic mark like ""Robocop"" did, it's still an awesome experience.

In the near future, Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is having dreams about Mars and his wife, Lori (Sharon Stone) is worried.  Quaid wants to take a trip to Mars, because it seems like his dreams are pushing him to go there.  Yet, there is a business called ""Rekall"" where people can go visit destinations in their minds, and have a totally different job, name, and agenda in their dream.  Quaid is interested and decides to take a two week ""Rekall"".  He chooses on being a secret agent on his stay at Mars.  Boy, that was a bad choice...

Pretty soon, Quaid is running from his own wife, the police, a man named Richter (Michael Ironside) who works for Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), who pretty much reigns over Mars.  Quaid himself ends up on Mars where a struggle is being held between Cohaagen and all the lower-class citizens and mutants.  He takes up with the rebel side and fights Cohaagen's men and finally learns the truth about Mars and himself...or is it all fake?

It seems that all the movies I have seen lately have the most confusing plots.  ""Total Recall"" is no exception.  Really, it can be very confusing at times and even the ending may seem like a downer to some, but I enjoyed it.  It was actually like a cliff-hanger.  The real point of the film is simple.  Is Quaid really a secret agent who has connections with Mars?  Was he was involved with Cohaagen as partners?  Or is this all a dream, just a part of ""Rekall""?  There are little clues along the way that can point in either direction, but the plot does get confusing at times.  I thought it made sense to me at least, and the acting, direction, and action scenes really help push the story along.

The acting is great.  Even though, Arnold is pretty much typecasted as the action hero, he really fits well into the script here and does a great job.  Sharon Stone was very good as well and was a bit underused in my opinion.  Rachel Ticotin shows up as Quaid's new love interest on Mars and she was great.  Ronny Cox plays the same part in ""Robocop"" (which isn't a bad thing).  Michael Ironside really stood out though.  He's just evil as Richter and I can't think of a better person to have played him (except for maybe Kurtwood Smith).

Paul Verhoeven direction was again in great shape.  The pacing was great and I never once looked at my watch or wanted to skip ahead.  And, then of course, you have the action sequences...

The action scenes in this movie are superb.  None of them are overlong and headache inducing by the end.  That's another reason I like Verhoeven's work.  The way the action is edited is really clean and easy to see the action unlike films today where it's a mess to see what's happening.  WARNING: The film is also very bloody and gory.  Although I didn't find it as brutal as ""Robocop"", it still has a lot of disturbing moments (in particular, the Escalator scene) of violence.  Yet, I don't think the violent action really takes away from the experience.  If anything, the action is overpowered by the story.

Overall, if you're looking for a science-fiction thriller, this is a great film to look into.  I believe it's Schwarzenegger's best film, Verhoeven's second best film, and an awesome experience all around.  ""Total Recall"" has everything from interesting story, to great characters, to outstanding direction, to intense action sequences.  I recommend it.

First, it is about a colony of inhabitants on Mars, a planet which has been inhabited for at least 1/2 million years. Next, there is suspense, action and drama associated with a cover-up by an earth-based government agency which is tied to the secret identity of Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwartzenegger). On the surface he is an ordinairy construction worker on earth ... yet his dreams and possible flash-backs of events and activities on Mars hint at something more deep and covert.

A place of civil unrest, the lower class citizens of the Mars colony are desperately fighting to survive as the corporate powers deny them of their most basic human needs.  And, for some unknown reason, the violence of their battle depicted on the daily news causes Douglas to well up with desire to be in the heart of it. His mundane life is so unsatisfying, despite being married to Sharon Stone, that when Douglas sees a TV commercial for a service that provides people with virtual memories, he decides it's worth the risk of being lobotomized. Before we know it, Douglas is being strapped in to take a virtual vacation from his everyday life and into that of a daring spy named Hauser, traveling to the planet Mars on a dangerous mission. Little does he know just how much that decision will change his life forever, or will it just be going back to normal? Who is he, really, Douglas or Hauser? Is our hero really just strapped in a chair and taking a virtual vacation, or is he really just waking up from one? Are we really just the sum of our memories?

In that long, but often enjoyable vein of ""question your reality"" movies, ""Total Recall"" is a commanding tour de force! High on adrenaline and testosterone, as any good Schwarzenegger movie should be, ""Total Recall"" earns the rank of one of his best! The film is a perfect balance of merciless action and thought provoking commentary, with loads of effects and plenty of humor thrown in. Arnold is in top form as Quaid/Hauser, as are Sharon Stone and villains Ronny Cox and Michael Ironside, but no less impressive on this film are the Oscar winning special effects from the likes of Rob Bottin, Tim McGovern, Eric Brevig, and Alex Funke. The Special Edition DVD is chock full of cool extras, from featurettes and trailers to galleries and storyboard comparisons, and, most notably, commentary from Director Paul Vorhoeven and star Arnold Schwarzenegger and an in-depth documentary on the creation of the film. The science throughout ""Total Recall,"" especially during the climactic ending, might lead some to eye rolling, but the film is so exciting and fun that the inaccuracies of its science most likely won't even cross your mind. Anyway, to quote MST3K's theme song, ""Just repeat to yourself, `It's just a show,' you should really just relax...,"" or, as Ham Salad says in ""Hardware Wars,"" ""Take it easy, kid.

74013,5,0784010331,"If you know a film stars Arnold, you hardly go and see it ( in Cinema or on DVD) for intellectual enlightenment. As for comparing TOTAL RECALL and  BLADE RUNNER... well, talk about Apples and Oranges; I like both, but for different  reasons.

I saw the VHS  version eons ago, and remember when the special edition DVD came out in the little ""Mars Shaped""  tin container. Almost as weird as the FRIGHT NIGHT VHS case shaped like a Coffin, but quite a nifty idea( However, Video rental Stores Hated it for display reasons).
From Years of watching the VHS version, I had a very distinct opinion about the film... I thought it was a straight action flick. Well, the first thing that the commentary  does is to disabuse you of that idea. Verhoeven has very grand ideas about his film-making, and by any standards, this film is at the least, a multi-layered work.
Whilst I can appreciate the subtext, and ""intertextual"" elements of academic books, its not much fun if you just want to escape in a film. Thats why this film works superbly if someone does not actually  TELL you that its not what you think it is ... as in the NAME OF THE ROSE ( both Book and film there are very layered).
For my money, if a film cannot entertain you, then its not what I want. Some films serve a different purpose, so if I watch a programme about the Psychoanalytic elements behind the death of Civilisations, I expect to work hard at understanding the work. Or Even a film ABOUT  ""Schrodingers Cat"" ( that is not about how to train a wayward  feline ) would be something I could halfway expect to be a work requiring some mental effort.

The R  rated version of this film is right on the money, and provides great FX, and lots of fun. The M rated version is a waste of time in my view, and also has some very stupid edits, the sort of stuff that appears on the evening news, but has to be cut because of MPAA rules.

The most interesting part of the commentary occurs when we find out HOW Verhoeven gets to be the man in the mix.
If Arnold can be said to be anything, it would seem that deal broker is definitely part of his resume.

If the old adage in the making of movies is that 90% of your effort is put into finding work, then Arnold does this well...  even if some say he cannot act :-).... At the Very least, one can say that he entertains. For my money, I think he can act,  either that, or I just enjoy Arnolds'  antics.",1112918400,3,2408,4.270925110132159
74014,3,0784010331,"Like Verhoeven's other movies, this one will divide viewers right down the middle. If you are addicted to blood and guts, ultra-violence, non-stop action - and if you are not bothered by blatant nonsense (or can shrug it off or savour it as ""irony"") - this one's for you. If, on the other hand, you are a Philip K Dick fan, you will be horrified at what has been done to ""We can remember it for you wholesale"". For contrast, ""Bladerunner"" was a good movie made from a good PKD story, and ""Minority Report"" was an outstanding version of another good PKD story. (Wait a moment here - I'm being redundant. All PKD stories are good, except those that are brilliant).

Mind you, Arnold Schwarzenegger's undeniable ""action-man"" charisma goes a long way towards making the result watchable. Arnold is in his element with pulp, the less credible the better. But even he can't help looking like a freak, with his eyes bulging up like inflatable beachballs in the low pressure of Mars' atmosphere (yeah, right). Fortunately modern technology can repressurize an entire planet in 30 seconds... but that's Verhoeven's attitude to reality in a nutshell.

All in all, this is quite fun to watch if you can unscrew your cerebral cortex and park it in the fridge for the duration. It's only when you think how superb a movie could have been made from PKD's material that you want to sit down and weep.",1108252800,7,1385,4.672131147540983

Ah, watching this again for the first time in 9 years brung back so much memories, including the ending phrase above to one of the biggest plot twists ion the movie.

This movie is about Douglas Quaid(Arnold Schwarzenegger), maried to Lori(Sharon Stone) who is making a serious disecion about going to Recal to go to Mars.  His friend tells him don't, but he goes anyway, and when it gowes wrong, the recall people put him in a cab, thus starting the story.

Quaid is confused why people are trying to pop caps in him, left and right; even his pal at work turned out to be another killer in his way.  It's all confusing, you can't help but wonder, why are all of these pople trying to kill him?!  Excessive gore(I'm talking pretty gory here[This movie was almost rated X])  without reason.  But if you keep on watching, you'll find a serious reson to why people want him dead(I'm taliking domination/savior reason)

The blood in this movie is someting most action movies don't have anymore(The're all weak compered to this).  If you were offended by kill bill, well this is worse because it's realisticly gory.  Not to mention what happened to people when they were exposed to Mars' atmospere(If you have a full-stomach and are weak then for the love of God refrain from watching those sceenes!)

The story behind this is a powerhouse.  About 2/3 through the film you find the reason behind the killing.(Plot twists hit you left, right, up, down, verticly, horizontaly, dianaly, eh, you get the picture.  It's rare to see story in bigtime action flicks like this, ex. Kill Bill, Bad Boys 2, Raw Deal, don't have plots for anything.

This movie is a gory work of art, with plot and Violence to keep suspence and action fans happy.  If you're a Schwarzenegger fan, this must be in you collection.  If you love the Terminator series(with the exception of 3) Then this is another great Sci-Fi film to get your hands on.  If you hate excessive gore, you might wanna stay clear!  This movie also left me with a cliffhanger thought: Is it reality, is it a dream, or is what the doctor that went in Quaid's room really saying was ture?  A Cliffganger to a sequal never to come.

Verhooven's films are full of action and gore, which tend to overshadow that they also tend to have a quite strong message. That's why Total Recall always bothered me: where is the message? But it is there, quite obvious really: it all takes place in Schwartzenegger's head; he is still in the reality simulator! That would explain why things start happening shortly after his visit there. It would explain why the girl on Mars looks exactly like the girl he chooses for the reality simulation. The whole ending with them close to dying in the low pressure on Mars is a total replay of what he experiences in the beginning, when we know he is in the reality simulator. Finally, it explains how ridicilously fast the Martian atmosphere is replenished by the melting glacier. Suddenly the film becomes really good, and truly follows the spirit of Dick.

74020,5,0784010331,"Total Recall is not only Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film; it is also one of the most complex cinematic statements ever made about reality, technology and totalitarianism.
The script is cracklingly smart, with multiple setups and payoffs that require repeated viewing to fully comprehend.  And the world of Total Recall is filled with little details that are now becoming closer and closer to reality:  The ""nature"" wallpaper in Doug Quaid (Schwarzenegger)'s apartment; the ""instant fingernail polish""; the ""virtual space trip"" that forms the core of the film's conceit; and the equation of government and corporation.
As Doug Quaid, Schwarzenegger brings his trademark humour and one-liners.  They fit the character well, making his quest for identity all that much more entertaining to watch; Sharon Stone has her breakthrough role as his insidious wife Lori; Rachel Ticotin is suitably heroic as sidekick Melina; and Ronny Cox offers up yet another terrific turn as villain Cohaagen, a much more complex and human character than his character in RoboCop, Dick Jones.  Cox has a way of chewing up megalomaniacal lines yet also bringing moments of realness and vulnerability to his character, and as a result the film acquires a much richer psychological layer.
All in all, this film's greatest power lies in its sociological concepts.  ""Blue sky on Mars""; ""more freedom, more air""; ""the walls of reality come crashing down""; ""your whole life is just a dream""; ""if I'm not me, who the hell am I?""  Each little detail is worth days of pondering over if you're the kind of viewer who likes to analyze text, and if you're not, you can always revel in Verhoeven's effortless virtuosic filmmaking, the extremely brisk narrative, and the over-the-top action set pieces, where Verhoeven once again sets new standards for both bloodlust and kinetic energy.",1076544000,35,1850,5.212121212121212
74021,5,0784010331,"The 1990 movie version of Total Recall starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone. In the movie version of the story, Douglas Quaid doesn't want a memory of being a spy on Mars. He just wants a memory of a trip to Mars. But of course when the people at Recall try to implant that, they realize he was a spy. Instead of the complex ""let him believe we mistakenly implanted it - refund half his money"" plotting of the story, the movie just has them dump him into a cab. Quaid goes home quite convinced he was on Mars, and the bad guys from the Mars Corporation show up to kill him, now that he's regaining his memory. He takes them out and a spy-friend of his gives him equipment to remove the head transmitter and get over to Mars.
Once there, he tries to figure out who he was, running into Melina (Rachel Ticotin) - an underground rebel. Once again we have a very Metropolis-like setup (same as in Minority Report) where those with money have lovely homes and luxury while those without money are on death's door. Quaid gets in to see the head of the rebels, Kuato, and at this point it turns out that Quaid was actually a double agent. He had been working for the Corporation to find out who Kuato was, and ALL of this - including the memory override, his life with fake-wife Lori, etc - was part of a deliberate plot for Quaid to break the rebels.
The ""new"" Quaid is a rebel-lover, though, and he breaks into the alien artifacts that the Corporation has been hiding. It turns out they are able to turn Mars into an air-rich world, so that the Corporation no longer has a power hold over all of the poor people. Quaid and Melina are happy together in a Hollywood Ending.
My Notes -
First, the minor changes. They turned Quail into Quaid. They turned wife Kirsten into Lori, who in the movie was lovey-dovey instead of nasty. Instead of the government benignly being after Douglas, being willing to help him out, it is now the Mars Corporation after Douglas, both trying to kill him and trying to 'egg him on' to get to Kuato so Kuato can be killed. This Corporation was risking an AWFUL lot on the sequence of events that 1) Douglas' repressed desire to go to Mars would be so strong that he'd seek an overlay, that 2) The overlay would fail in such a way that he'd get a bunch of his memories back, that 3) he wouldn't be psychotic as a result but would merrily head over to Mars to research it, 4) in his bungling state, even though he was undoubtedly a spy, he'd be brought right into Kuato's presence, 6) Kuato would indeed be killed, and 6) at the end they'd be able to sort out Quaid's brain enough to return him back to his pre-memory-messing evil state. That's all very hard to believe.
Next, as if all of that wasn't bad enough, the point of the original story was that this Mars thing was just a PRELUDE to the real story. In the book, Quaid didn't even go to Mars. The Recall trip was enough to reveal he was a spy, at which point he pretty much shrugs his shoulders and says ""OK well hopefully you can fix me so I don't remember my spy days."" At which point they realize there was something even MORE important than his spy days in his brain. But in the movie version, it's all about him being a spy and saving the underclass of Mars from an air monopoly. That whole Metropolis situation wasn't in the book at all.
Since probably 99% of the movie wasn't in the original storyline at all, it's a good thing they didn't keep the same title to try to claim it was the same story. Of course I imagine if the original title HAD been Total Recall, they might have kept it for the same reason they kept the title on the other wildly altered story-to-movie transformations of Dick's tales. I imagine the only reason they changed it in this case was that We Can Remember It For You Wholesale was too long to fit on movie posters.
They did have aliens at the end, but instead of the aliens planning on coming to kill all Earthlings, the aliens were a kind, benevolent race that conveniently left an entire, functional air-making machine in place but not running. Why would they build it but not turn it on? If they built it millions of years in the past, what's the chances that the aliens back then knew the exact mixture of oxygen/etc. that us Earthlings would need to breathe and have a machine to make it? Why not turn on the machine back then so that a great planet would be waiting for us, instead of leaving us a nasty planet that we had to turn on ourselves?
I did like the bit where Douglas has to decide if he really IS on Mars, talking to the Recall agent, or if this is just some sort of hallucination he's having in his brain while his body is back on Earth. To judge by a sweat bead is silly though. If he WAS psychotic, and believed he was on Mars, then he could easily have projected that sweat bead on the Recall agent as part of his psychosis. It would match the mind-state he would be in. I also have to say that people's eyes wouldn't bulge like that on Mars even if there wasn't air.
I like the movie a lot, and have seen it many times. But as a version of a Philip K Dick story, it misses the boat. It's a great standalone sci fi story, though, with fun twists and turns, and fun 'background technology'. A personal favorite of mine is the wall-screen in their kitchen.",1075852800,7,5299,4.284147557328016
74022,5,0784010331,"""Total Recall"" is, quite simply, one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action flicks and quite obviously, one of the ones that helped build his super star status at the time of its release.  When this outstanding Sci-Fi action/thriller was released, it was right in the middle of Arnold Schwarzenegger's run of films where he could seemingly do no wrong.  After watching the ""Imagining Total Recall"" documentary, it's even more surprising to find out that the original director wasn't Paul Verhoeven and the original Douglas Quaid wasn't to be Arny but Patrick Swayze; now that would've been an almost entirely different movie.  Despite the exceptional script, I doubt Patrick Swayze would've garnered the attention that Arnold did for this memorable flick.
One of the most interesting aspects behind the script of this film is the overall theme behind it, was it ""real"" or was it Douglas Quaid's Total Rekall experience?  Another highly interesting aspect of this film is its supposed sequel which may have been scrapped for Arnold Schwarzenegger's bid for and election as the Governor of Kalifornia!  If you pull up the Cast and Crew Information under the Special Features section and click on Arnold's screen, you'll see a listing for Total Recall 2 (2002), something that obviously hasn't happened but who knows what will happen in the future!
Credit goes to Arnold for his performance in this film, which was an exceptional display in that his acting skills were only getting better and better; granted, he's not the best actor in the industry, but for his type of movies, he was at the top when this film was released.  Sharon Stone puts on a wonderful performance in this film and this film can most certainly be directly attributed to being the one that led to her super stardom and being cast for some of her bigger roles.  Ronny Cox also does another superior job of being the villain in this movie, a role he has always done well in.  For Star Trek Voyager fans, it's interesting to note that Robert Picardo does the voiceover for the Johnny Cab.
""Total Recall"" is just another in a long list of outstanding and somewhat gory action flicks for director Paul Verhoeven.  In this genre, he can most certainly be counted among the best directors to ever take up the mantle.  Phillip K. Dick, the author of the short story ""We Can Remember it for You Wholesale,"" the story that ""Total Recall"" is based upon, also wrote the story that ""Blade Runner"" was based upon and many more; just showing what a talent this writer has been.
The Premise:
Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wakes up to find himself lying next to Lori (Sharon Stone), who he believes to have been his loving wife for the last eight years.  Quaid expresses that he wishes to go to Mars but Lori doesn't want anything to do with it.  As Quaid is coming home from work, he sees an advertisement for Total Rekall where he can take a virtual vacation and decides to try it.  Not long after his virtual vacation begins, this action flick takes off on a breathtaking wild ride that doesn't slow down until the credits start rolling...
I highly recommend this film to any and all who're interested in seeing one of the best Sci-Fi action movies ever made.  One note of caution though, this film is not for the young, faint of heart or weak of stomach as is the norm with a Paul Verhoeven film.  To achieve the film he's looking for, he doesn't spare the gore at all!  {ssintrepid}

74023,5,0784010331,"Paul Verhoeven took it on the chin from fans of Philip K. Dick for this film (just as he did from Heinlein fans for his odd take on _Starship Troopers_).
But this nonstop SF action-thriller -- besides being, as its legion of fans will attest, a helluva lot of fun to watch -- is actually a fair translation to the screen of Dick's 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale'. I won't give away any spoilers here, but watch it carefully: are you _sure_ that by the end of the movie you know what's real and what isn't?
Readers of Dick's brilliant short story probably wouldn't have cast Arnold in the lead role, either. But all that proves is that we aren't Paul Verhoeven. The movie works.
Arnold is in terrific form here as Douglas Quaid, a guy who wants to go to Mars so badly that the subject has become an obsession. He nips off to Rekal, Incorporated, to get a set of false memories implanted, and the rest is SF film history.
The special effects are extremely good and the Martian landscape is pretty well realized (although some portions of the 'science' part of the science fiction are decidedly lacking). The supporting cast is magnificent, from Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin to Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox. As we expect from Verhoeven, the dialogue includes quite a bit of profanity and the action includes a lot of gory violence. But if you weren't okay with that, you wouldn't be looking for an Arnold movie, would you?
I have the Special Limited Edition (the one with the Mars-shaped metal box). The 'special' features are nice; Schwarzenegger and Verhoeven provide some good commentary and the 'making-of' documentary is worth watching once.

74026,5,0784010331,This is a true science fiction film directed by master filmmaker Paul Verhoeven.  Arnold does some of his best acting and Sharon Stone delivers in a pivotal supporting role.  Right on par with Robocop and Starship Troopers.,1070755200,,223,5.0
74027,5,0784010331,"He may be governor of California now, but Arnold's past is studded with high points, and this is one of them.
The storyline, everybody knows by now; it's a tale of faulty memory and as Arnold finds out more about his past, so does the audience.  The climax of the film is suitably epic, and this may be one of the last great films to use miniatures instead of CGI.  In any event, the effects look fantastic, even to this day.
But the acting and casting is on par with the FX, thankfully.  Ronny Cox continues his association with director Paul Verhoeven (from ""Robocop"" fame) to play the villain once more, and we've got Sharon Stone RIGHT before she broke big.  Rachel Ticotin is capable, and thankfully, we've got veteran Canadian character actor Michael Ironside as Cohagen's chief henchman, Rictor.
Arnold would go on to replicate elements of this story in ""The Sixth Day"", but to less impressive effect.  15 years of advancement in CGI graphics can't replace a good story, and here's the proof.
As far as the DVD treatment goes, this one is almost as good as the ""Conan The Barbarian"" set; one of the finest on the market.  I can't believe that in a film like this there aren't any deleted scenes, but in any event, the sound and picture quality are excellent.
One of my favourite movies to watch every now-and-then.  A classic action/sci-fi movie that's aged pretty well.",1070236800,,1377,4.6419753086419755
74028,4,0784010331,"Like most of Phillip Dick's stories, this story contains a lot of depth and quite a bit of morality, too.  This sci-fi movie focuses on one of the life's deepest questions:  what actually exists, and how can we determine the answer?
For Arnold Schwarzenegger, who plays Quaid, answering this question is rather complicated.  It is rather difficult to determine what is real and what isn't.
Quaid wakes up one morning and realize that he's had a horrible dream.  His wife wakes him up, and she's jealous of the dream.  The dream!  This first scene is important for the entire movie because it results in Quaid waking up, upset over the dream, and his wife, also upset, mainly because she thinks he was cheating with a woman in his dreams!
It seems as though dreams are a way for Quaid to think about things that are not available in his everyday life.  That's one reason why he chooses to go traveling -- through the experience of ""recalling"" it, rather than actually going on a full trip.  This causes him trouble since the company Recall does not appear legitimate in his friend's and co-workers.  From there, the movie is focused on Quaid's taking steps to understand what he has done in the past, on Mars, even though he has no recollection of it.  Lots of action occurs.  The deep message within the movie is that there are times when you need to believe quite strongly in your dreams, and others when you must believe it's false.  How do you determine which is which is left up to each person's perspective.",1070150400,,1512,4.600746268656716
74029,3,0784010331,"I really do adore this film, but I found it difficult to give it more than three stars, not only out of respect for myself, but for the many other films that deserve the full five. Sin-of-sins, I actually prefer it to ""Blade Runner"", but I'd still give Scott's sci-fi outing more stars than Verhoeven's. They are poles apart in terms of plot, pallette and directorial subtlety. This is mostly just nostalgia for my part (I watched this film a lot when I was a kid), but ""Total Recall"" is simply more FUN. Buy it if you're not out for anything too radical in the brain stakes.
The most interesting thing about this film is actually a piece of conjecture that I stumbled across in literary fiction that could drive a more suggestable person to a five star rating. What if the bad guy is not half as stupid as we're led to believe by the rather em...strange ending? Allow me to explain.
Mars is a remarkably large body, but after about twenty seconds worth of oxygen spurting from a mountain (I won't even go into the bad science behind that), it turns from the nasty vacuum packed red planet we know from the science books, into a rather pleasant looking national park kind of a place. That's exhibit one.
Before all this, Arnie and his mad-dog sqaw are thrown out into said vacuum where their eyes, as one would expect, begin to pop out of their head. Uch. Less expected though, is the miraculous recovery they make after all this excitement has past. They get up, dust themselves down, and head off to start a new life on the until-recently-red planet. That's Exhibit two. Need I go on?
The whole scenario's a bit crazy; a bit far fetched; a load of nonsense...""Ah-hah"", he drawled triumphantly wagging his finger.
What if Co-Haagen, supposedly not so lucky with HIS dose of heamoragic eye trouble, isn't really dead? What if he's not even on Mars? What if even Arnie's not on Mars?
That horribly evil chap behind the whole starve-the-people-of-oxygen thing could still have Arnie in that nasty leather chair contraption. Arnie's character would just be lying there drooling, completely out of Co-Haagen's way. Not only that, but the last vestige of his conscience would actually think he'd WON!
Brilliant stuff. That little scenario could really boost the intellectual credability of this flick, and I hope you're all happy that I pointed it out.",1069977600,,2347,4.699029126213592
74030,5,0784010331,"(...)>Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, who is having a serious identity crisis. He lives in the future. In the future, people have the ability to live on Mars. Well, guess who wants to go to Mars? Unfortunately, Douglas' wife (Sharon Stone) is not too happy about that idea, and wants to stay on Earth. So, what's a guy to do if his wife doesn't want to move? Get a memory implant, of course! Using the latest technology, memories can be implanted in your brain in a matter of moments. You choose the destination, identity (spy, civilian, etc...) and Total Rekall (yes, Total Rekall) will install it for you.
Warned by his friends not to get the implant, Quaid does so anyway. But something goes terribly wrong. Soon, his wife, friends and co-workers are all trying to kill him...but why? The answer may kill him.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role of Quaid. People can argue all they want about how bad an actor he is, but you can't say that after seeing this movie. He pulls the film's acting and stunts off with ease, all the while spitting out his catchy one-liners (""Consider this a divorce!"").
Sharon Stone is probably at her best here, (...)This movie made her).
Paul Verhoeven directs this film, and there are no arguments that this is his finest work - by far. He was the director who went on to make such ""critically acclaimed"" (...)films such as ""Showgirls"" and ""Hollow Man."" His only other film that was remotely good was ""Basic Instinct,"" but this is still ten times better (...)
The special effects in this movie are excellent; supposedly, they spent millions and millions on the fake Mars sets, and I bet they're glad it paid off.
I recently bought the ""Total Recall"" Limited Edition DVD with a newly remastered digital makeover, Dolby Digital 5.1, behind-the-scenes documentary(s), a commentary by Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger, and much, much more. If you can find one now (it was limited edition so it might be off the market, now) I would recommend picking a copy up. (...)P>""Total Recall"" stands as Arnold's most ""thinkative"" film and best conspiracy-type thriller. In fact, it is one of the best sci-fi/futuristic thrillers ever.
(...)
Anyway, I'm getting off the subject. ""Total Recall"" is a good movie, and a darn good one at that. It provides everything we want - and more - in a movie.

74032,5,0784010331,"Total Recall is one of the best and most original movies of all time. It's an awesome sci-fi action tail with enough twists and turns that leave you wanting more.
Total Recall is tells the story of Douq Quaid(Schwarzenegger). He's a man that dreams about going to mars. He's a normal guy who has a construction job. He's married to his wife Lori(Stone) and they are new to the place they are living. It's set any where from a 100 to 150 years from now. Space travel is a common thing, and like I said Quaid wants to go to mars. Everyone he knows is steering him away from the whole idea of going. He sees a commercial on tv from a company called Recall. Recall puts an implant into your memory that acts as a vaction. It makes you feel like you've gone on a vacation because it's in your memorys. Quaid goes to Recall and thats where the movie really picks up.
While he's at Recall they find out his memorys have already been erased. The company puts it off as they did nothing to him but are unsuccesful. Quaid then finds himself being hunted by different people who want him dead. He doesn't why and he must follow the clues that are left for him to find out why.
That's kind of the cliff notes version of the movie. Like I said it's a complex storyline that changes a lot. You have to see it to fully understand it.
Arnold is outstanding. This is probaly the best acting he ever did in any of his movies. His action scenes are great in the movie. You see him kill plenty of guys plenty of different ways. His character Quaid is probaly the most complex character he's every played, because Quaid isn't sure who he really is. It's really great and Arnold does a great job.
The special effects are great. They did win the Oscar for best effects in 1990 and it's easy to see why. The different mutants they create on mars are great. When people are stuck in the vaccum of mars they really do look like there going to explode. The different explosions and blasts just look great, and it's another reason to watch the film.
I love Total Recall. It's a movie masterpiece. If your an Arnold fan it's definetly a must see. Most sci fi fans should get a kick out of it as well. Even people that like a good mystery or a fast paced movie should enjoy it a lot. This Special Edition comes in a cool Tin case that's kind of like a KIWI shoe poish case that makes a good collectors item. Don't miss out on this movie. You'll regret it.",1067126400,4,2425,4.251082251082251
74033,5,0784010331,"But nonetheless enjoyable, this is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action movie! It was the second action flick for director Paul Verhoeven, who initially hit the American market with an art film starring Jeroen Krabbe called ""The 4th Man"". Apparently, he hasn't looked back since ""Robocop"".

The movie stars Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, Ronny Cox and a few character actors you'll recognize from TV and other films. In this story, set in the near-future, Schwarzenegger plays an unassuming construction worker, married to Stone, who is fascinated with the Martian colonies of his time. His ""wife"", Stone, hates Mars and tries to discourage him from thinking about it...but an ad for a ""memory implant service"" called ""Rekall"" on the ad monitors in the futuristic subway compel him to visit it for a virtual vacation to Mars as a secret agent.

Douglas Quaid's, (Arnold's character's,) life immediately changes, as it's soon discovered that his marriage to Stone is a sham, that he has another persona, Hauser, that works for the vulgar, power hungry, robber baron ruler of Mars, Vilos Cohaagen, as a very dirty agent with a wicked sense of humor and a smarmy pesonality. He's chased by Michael Ironside and his crew all over Mars as he tries to determine just what has been done to him and what he is being used for.

In a twist, a representative from ""Rekall"" visits him in the middle of all this and tries to tell him that if he doesn't come out of his induced fantasy now, he may become irrevocably altered by it. Quaid doesn't believe this, however, and after seeing a betraying sweat bead drip down the supposedly ""virtual"" rep's temple, he shoots him.

Stone, playing Quaid's faux wife, Laurie, was also ""brought up to Mars"" by the rep to convince Quaid/Hauser that everything he has experienced before was a part of his Rekall fantasy. She ends up getting into a hand to hand battle with him after she runs into Ticotin, a rebel fighting Laurie's employer, Cohaagen, in a corridor, and he ends up shooting Laurie!

Along the way, there are dangers from decompression from urban dome damage from the pursuit of Quaid, exposure to mutants, an adventure with a crooked, black mutant cab driver working for Cohaagen and the meeting with the old ""flame"" of his, named Melina, (Ticotin,) who is working for the rebels that are fighting Cohaagen for control of Mars and better living conditions on the colonized world. This is all curiously offset by a recurring and ultimately prophetic dream that Arnie keeps having of he and Ticotin being caught ouside the domes of Mars without helmets. There are quite a lot of robotics used in the film...betcha it'll take you a while to determine where it's being used....

The story has more twists, turns, O. Henrys and vagaries than ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"", but in the end, a very good thing comes of it, but I won't spoil it for you here.

Be warned that this movie is VERY violent,(GRUESOME in parts, even!) and is full of foul language issuing from every mouth with a substantial or walk-on part. However, it has to be one of the most enjoyable sci-fi action flicks ever made, so I highy recommend this film for mature minds who can weather dialogue and violence that almost earned it an ""X"" rating! The theme and incidental music, composed by Jerry Goldsmith, is fantastic, btw!",1066262400,,3379,4.825561312607944

74036,4,0784010331,"Total Recall, Paul Verhoeven's fascinating (if sometimes very violent) 1990 science fiction/thriller examined the boundaries between reality and illusion. It also established Arnold Schwarzenegger as a true force in the action adventure genre, proving that the former bodybuilder could act in a more challenging role than Conan or the Terminator.
Inspired by Philip K. Dick's story ""We Can Dream It For You Wholesale,"" the screenplay by Ronald Shussett, Dan O'Bannon (Alien) and Gary Goldman weaves a clever tapestry of story threads that revolve around the question of what is reality and what is a dream, especially if the mind could be manipulated artificially?
Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone) and living in a city perhaps 100 years in the future.  By this time, Earth is embroiled in a major war between the Northern and Southern Blocs, space travel is as routine as catching a bus, and Mars has been colonized. Its governor, a ruthless dictator named Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) is providing the Northern bloc with essential raw materials and suppressing a bloody insurrection led by mutants.
Quaid is obsessed with a fantasy of Mars -- in his dreams he's there, in the company of a mysterious brunette (Rachel Ticotin), much to Lori's chagrin. Even as he claims it's just a fantasy and that Lori's the only woman in his life, he still presses the issue of Mars, going as far to suggest leaving Earth and moving to the Red Planet.  Lori attempts to reason with Quaid, telling him he'd ""hate it there. It's dry, it's dusty, it's boring.""  Reluctantly, Quaid relents and goes off to work as usual.
But after seeing a commercial for ""virtual vacations"" on a subway TV monitor, Quaid decides to visit Rekall, where false memories are implanted into customers' minds ""for the memory of a lifetime.""  With the aid of drugs and hi-tech gizmos, the perfect vacation -- a ski trip, a visit to an exotic beach, or even a trip to Mars -- can be ""remembered"" as if it had really happened.  Even better, as a smarmy salesman tells Quaid, one can even change personalities and take the ""Ego Trip"" and become, for a little while, someone else.  Intrigued, Quaid selects -- you guessed it -- the trip to Mars with the secret agent Ego Trip.
Verhoeven's films are not known for their quiet subtlety; indeed, they tend to be in-your-face collages of mordant wit, wry one-liners, and -- in his science fiction films (Robocop, Starship Troopers) -- violence.  Yet, when watching this movie on DVD and listening to the audio commentary by Verhoeven and Schwarznegger, I was surprised by the complexity of this film's plot.  Yes, it's action packed and it's an ""Ah-nuld"" showcase full of droll one-liners (""Consider this a divorce!""), but it doesn't insult the audience's intelligence.  The movie's eye-popping (pun intended) special effects are amazing, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is thrilling.
The Artisan Special Edition of Total Recall is loaded with various extra features and showcases this above-average sci-fi thriller in a newly remastered widescreen version. The picture is sharp and the sound is excellently clear.  Considering that Artisan is also behind the spectacular DVDs for the first two Terminator films, this is to be expected!
I strongly recommend Total Recall to both Schwarzenegger and science fiction fans alike; its underlying storyline is intriguing, and Arnold has rarely been in better form as an actor!",1059264000,10,3473,5.066549912434326

This is one of the few sci-fi jobs from the last 15 years that is consistant throughout.  Spielberg should have watched this before he made the disaterous ""Minority Report"".  Though also based on a Dick story, Recall doesn't fall flat after an hour, nor does it drowned out with endless exposition scenes that seem to plague Minority Report. Verhoeven also resists explaining it all to us at the end, here is where he shows a dicipline with the material that Spielberg lacks.

74041,4,0784010331,"Phillip K. Dick's works are notoriously difficult to bring to the screen; think back to all the controversy surrounding ""Blade Runner"". Even ""Minority Report"" required some of the best minds of our time just to get some ideas up on the screen. But once they are there, you can be sure that a memorable movie ensues.
Arnold doesn't disappoint, and neither does respectable director Paul Verhoeven (""Robocop"", ""Starship Troopers"", whoops - ""Showgirls"") in this 1990 hit. Schwarzenegger is at the top of his game - within the ten-year period from 1984-1994, every film he touched turned to solid gold. He's good here as a confused, betrayed Douglas Quaid, possibly stuck in a dream or reprogrammed into a spy's head or the victim of a mind trip gone haywire. Actually, the four screenwriters, two of which wrote the superior ""Alien"", never do adequately explain Quaid's predicament, but the viewer is so caught up in his x-ray smashing, blade-running (the comparisons are inevitable) character that not much else matters.
Quaid is an earthling who, while he has a beautiful wife and a lovely job on his home planet, can't help but wonder what life might be like on the now-inhabitable Mars. But instead of visiting the dangerous planet, he visits Rekall, Inc., and the company sends him on a mind trip to Mars. Or do they? The film travels from the ultraviolent (re: Sharon Stone) to the downright bizarre (Martian deformations). Ronny Cox is good as a baddie, and Arnold seems to be enjoying himself. Though the trippy holograms and alien structures and shootouts are fun, the film amounts to relatively little except for a good time. It should have stuck closer to Dick's original plans, but who's complaining?
The DVD makes up for most of the movie's deficits, thankfully - a rare commentary track from Ahnold and Verhoeven provide nice insights (if you can get over the accents) and the featurettes are pretty cool. I love the evolution of the ""Total Recall"" trailers, nicely charted here. Overall, a well-stocked DVD and a movie well worth seeing.

Doug was somehow transformed by Cox and his associates, and he no longer has any memory of the events. Doug finds out more than he cares to, and he is left to find out who he really is.  Is he simply Doug, or is he someone else altogether?
The plot of the movie is excellent and is loaded with top notch special effects.  The hologram scenes are especially well-done.

74051,4,0784010331,"Following the spectacular success of the sci-fi opus ""The Predator"", Schwarzenegger and company began searching for another vehicle to use to advantage to continue their winning record of blockbuster films. Here they scored very well with a tightly written, well-scripted, and plot-twisting movie that left Arnold fans screaming for more. Based on an original story by famed Science fiction maven Philip Dick (of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Minority Report"" fame), the storyline revolves around the mysterious obsession of a seemingly ordinary construction worker distracted by persistent nightmares of life on Mars.  Soon we discover that the worker (played, of course by big Arnie) is anything but ordinary, and that he has good reason for his continuing obsession.
The plot rages widely, careening in bizarre but plausible twists from moment to moment, and unless one follows closely it is easy to miss all the clues that Director Paul Verhoeven leaves scattered through the movie to tantalize the viewer. The special effects used here are indeed spectacular and very well executed, and Schwarzenegger takes us on a virtual busman's tour of the world of Mars as it whirls into overdrive, out of control, in the grip of a mysterious series of inexplicable political events and intrigues. Of course, like much of science fiction, there are moral lessons to be appreciated, and a series of intriguing incidents seem more intended as commentaries on contemporary 20th century politics than as anything related to Mars. Still, the plot spins quickly enough to tie the action sequences together nicely, and the cast, which includes both Sharon ZStone as his conniving wife and Ronnie Cox as the villain, does a credible job of delivering us to the eventual climax both entertained and edified.
This is one of the best Schwarzenegger offerings in a series of such efforts, including ""Running Man', also very well made, and some less well conceived, executed, and received by the public. It is made even better by virtue of the commentaries by the actors, director, and special effects crew on the film, with their perspectives adding immeasurably to one's understanding of the plots and of various interpretations of the film. Nowadays the big guy's career seems to be on the down-turn, although the current buzz has him completing the second sequel to ""The Terminator"", tentatively called ""T-3"" for release next summer. If it is as good as the first two, it could revive his flagging film career. Don't worry folks; he'll be back, if not as an actor, than as Governor of the fine state of California!  Anything Jessie Ventura can do, he can do better. Enjoy!",1028505600,5,2647,5.1108545034642034

The plot really, is straightforward. Who can't follow this movie. Only geniuses can understand this movie and I do! Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rachel Ticotin have chemistry! So does Sharon Stone!

And this is what raises the film above standard sci fi fare, the 'is he or isn't he?' twists are clever and make the viewer actually use his/her brain! Shocker!

74064,5,0784010331,"Ah, long ago there was a time when Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn't concerned with making socially relevant films ... his mainstay was the science fiction / fantasy / action genre.  When he was at the height of the form, he had no rival, and TOTAL RECALL stands as a testament to his greatness.
With top notch special effects along with a story inspired by the master Philip K. Dick, Arnold proved that not had there been life on Mars long ago but life today was possible for humans with the right combination of scientific events.
Along for the ride were a youthfully sexy vixen named Sharon Stone, an equally sexy rival in Rachel Tinochen, a wonderfully evil villain in Ronny Cox, and genre fav Michael Ironside chewed scenery as well as Arnie did.
The commentary track adds some depth into the preproduction, filming, and postproduction process -- with a healthy amount of anecdotes thrown in for the average viewer -- making this Special Limited Edition (a tin in the shape of Mars, nonetheless) worth the view.",1013385600,3,1011,4.777142857142858
74065,4,0784010331,"I could talk a lot about the stuff I like about ""Total Recall"" - the dynamite special effects, production design and action, the numerous Schwarzenegger one-liners (""Consider that a divorce"" is my favorite), and the colorful supporting characters. And what's not to love about a movie that gives us midget hookers on Mars?
But that kind of stuff is de rigeur for ""Ahnuld"" films; what really sets this apart is clever, mind-bending premise that director Paul Verhoeven chooses never answers: was this all ""real,"" or just an implanted memory? Was Schwarzenenegger's character, Doug Quaid, really a secret agent, or was this just an ""ego trip,"" an implanted memory that looks and feels real?
There's an intriguing sequence about halfway through the movie in which Quaid is confronted by a doctor from Rekall, the company that sold Quaid his ""secret agent on Mars"" fantasy. The doctor, accompanied with his wife (Sharon Stone), tries to convince Quaid that his experiences aren't real at all, but part of the fantasy Rekall sold him; unless Quaid comes back to reality (by taking a pill), he'll end up a mindless zombie.
Of course, in Quaid's fantasy (or reality?), his wife has already tried to kill him, so he's not listening too closely to what she says. But for a moment, Quaid is buying what the doctor has to say...until he sees him sweating, and shoots him in the head. The logic, of course, is that if the doctor is make-believe, he wouldn't be under enough stress to sweat. However, who's to say that's not part of the fantasy?
A movie with less intelligence would have answered these sorts of questions, and given the audience a pat ""wrap up"" sequence to tie up all the loose ends. But give tons of credit to ""Total Recall"": in the best sci-fi tradition, it's up to the audience to figure it out what really happened.
Along the way, we're treated to a spectacular vision of a future Mars, populated by human colonists and mutants (including a three-breasted prostitute who'd probably make a fortune in Las Vegas). There's a red-light district (""Venusville""), which is apparently to the future what Amsterdam or Bangkok are to today's tourists: a sex destination. You can get a ""Mars Today"" newspaper, or check into the Hilton.
Verhoeven is a master of these movies, in which the future isn't quite ""Blade Runner,"" but fairly well warped. Things we take for granted today, like commercials, mass transit, or vacations, still exist, even though they've morphed slightly. This is a world we can all recognize and relate to.
Of course, all is not well on Mars, as the planet's governor, Cohagen (Ronnie Cox) is charging the good citizens of the planet too much for air, and is trying to quell a rebellion. Quaid goes to Mars thinking he might have fought alongside the rebels against Cohagen, but finds out that he might have actually been working for Cohagen all along.
Before too long, Quaid discovers Cohagen's secret: there's a huge, alien-built machine that will melt massive underground ice deposits, and create a breathable atmosphere on Mars. If Mars has an atmosphere, Cohagen loses his power over the people - their air supply.
How does Quaid learn all this? He encounters a mutant who pops out of a seemingly normal person's belly, reads Quaid's thoughts, and shows him the truth. Of course, this is after we meet the three-breasted prostitute, so by this point, we're not surprised.
The wind-up, in which Quaid gives Mars its' atmosphere, is about as fanciful as you'd please - one wonders exactly how the oxygen content on the planet become sufficient in five minutes - but it ties into the whole ""is it real or is it a fantasy"" premise.
After all, the name of the fantasy Quaid selects at Rekall is ""Blue Sky On Mars.""
Is it for real, or is Quaid sitting in a machine imagining all this, and having his brain warped as the doctor said?

True sci-fi is deeply rooted in science fact, with an eye toward where the leading edge of those fact may take us all.  Science fantasy serves my tastes better.  Contact, for example, was much more of a science fact film.  When it opened next to Men In Black, however, there was no contest as to where I wanted to find my entertainment.  And MIB was about as far out there as sci-fanstasy gets.
That said, this is one of the lowest browed science fantasy films ever produced.  Thick with camp and clich, it barely kept my attention in the theater.  The 'adventure' was packed with unlikable characters quipping moronic lines, following unbelievable motivations, and ignoring some of the basic laws of physics with reckless abandon.
The ending was completely God awful, with Arnold getting sucked out of a climate controlled area (with air) into the Martian landscape (no air) and getting saved in 30 seconds (as he slowly and unrealistically starts to facially expand from the pressure difference) by a generator that he just turned on (which is kicking out enough air - from the hill right behind him - that in 30 or so seconds the entire planet has enough air to save him).  If you don't see the multitude of glaring problems here, it is back to 7th grade World Science for you.
All in all, this is just another movie that was written to be one thing, and then was mauled by Arnold Inc. into Just Another Easily Forgotten Arnold Action Vehicle.  I like Arnold, but this tripe he should be ashamed of only second to his Mr. Freeze in Batman Forever (that one hurt, I was looking forward to a good Batman flick and I got lines like ""everrry bod-dee cheel"" from Ah-nold).

Chapter #4 Bob McClain, the salesman at REKALL, says to Quaid: ""You are a top operative, back under deep cover. On your most important mission. People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet this beautiful, exotic woman .... by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, kill the bad guys, and save the entire planet!""
Chapter #5 Rekall Dr. Lull hands her assitant Ernie something. He says, ""That's a new one. Blue sky on Mars"" Dr. Lull then asks Doug, ""How do you like your women?"" After getting all Quaid's answers she picks #41A which the screen shows as Melina. The exact woman we see later on Mars.
Chapter #15 Dr. Edgemar from Rekall visits Quaid in his hotel on Mars and says: ""...the consequences to you would be devasting. In your mind I'll be dead and with no one to guide you out you'll be stuck in permant psycosis.  The walls of reality will come crashing down. One minute you'll be the saviour of the rebel cause and the next thing you know you'll be Cohaagen's bosem buddy.  You'll even have fantasies about alien civilizations, as you requested, but in the end, back on Earth, you'll be lobotomized!""

74077,5,0784010331,"Total Recall is a milestone in Scince Fiction Cinema that helped boost the careers of actor Arnold Scwarzenegger, actress Sharon Stone, as well as director Paul Verhoeven, who first got our attention with his other Sci-Fi Masterpiece; Robocop.
Certainly purists will pick the film apart, but as Leanord Nimoy once said in Star Trek II, ""It is easier to destroy than to create"".  Total Recall works on two levels: a dream or a reality, but whichever way you choose to watch the movie, both levels make sense to you.  That in itself is an accomplishment.  Most sci-fi's these days can't even work on one level, let alone two.
If you've been holding out for a Special Edition of Total Recall, you can finally cash in your chips because it has finally arrived, in a circular metal tin, shaped to look like Mars no less.  I'm sure that some people will have mixed feelings on the special features (the ""Recall's Virtual Vacations"" are nothing really special) only because other releases like the T2 Special Edition have made us more picky as far as a good S.E. and a bad one.  Total Recall extras are in no way bad.  The 30 minute ""Imagining Total Recall"" documentary is well made and delivers a lot of insight.  It's also a retrospective documentary, with both Arnold and Mr. Verhoeven looking back at the film 10 years after the fact.  This is of course defined more closely in the audio commentary by both the star and the director.  If you bought the Collector's Edition of Conan The Barbarian and enjoyed Arnold's audio commentary for that movie, you'll most assuredly enjoy this one..although there was no mention of the two working together on a sequel which has been talked about for years.
The disappointment from many is that Total Recall, at one time, had a longer cut which made it even more excessively violent.  From fear of receiving and X-rating, the film was cut down to the version we all know and love.  Why hasn't Paul Verhoeven added those scenes back in now or at least given us a deleted scenes section?  Considering that Robocop and Basic Instinct (his two other successful movies) have already gotten the ""Director's Cut"" treatment, it is indeed a wonder why Total Recall was forgotten in that aspect.  Not that I'm complaining, but considering that the T2 Special Edition gave us three different versions of that movie to watch, would it have been so bad to do the same here?
As far as the picture and sound is concerned I don't have any real complaints whatsoever.  The picture is crisp, clean and clear and the sound plays great on my sound system.  Perhaps one day a two disc set of Total Recall will be released.  Yeah, and maybe one day Paul Verhoeven will release a Special Unrated Edition of ""Showgirls"", complete with commentary. Until then.

Being a videophile I am obsessed in getting the best quality picture and sound available! So my reviews will concentrate on the total DVD package.
TOTAL RECALL is my (#2nd) Home Theatre DVD Review. This is the movie's second release and the first was fair but they got it right on this ""Special Limited Edition"".
Now this DVD is Digitally ReMastered (Picture & Sound). It is enhanced for Widescreen (16:9 Aspect Ratio) TV's & HDTV's. The movies picture is one of the best (sharpest clarity) I've ever seen on home DVD. NOTE: 480p = 480 horizontal lines (Digital) of Progressive Scan (p) - which is basically a line doubler and using COMPONENT VIDEO cable for the best picture quality. Regular DVD players have 480i = 480 horizontal lines (Analog) and use either COMPOSITE or S-VIDEO Cables. For more information see my SD-6200 & MV3CV-2M reviews.
Simply put this is a scifi Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie of the highest quality (special effects, story line, casting & color). He is caught between a boring life and the strange desire to be an action hero on Mars. He sees a TV ad referring to a brain implant journey to Mars. This is the latest Travel scheme fad of the time. A mental exercise in time and space. (pretty clever huh?) The name of the company is ""Rekall"". This is just the beginning of a great DVD journey!!!! (Parental Guidance required - some graphic violence and mutant make-up).
The colors are absolutely beautiful, so vivid. The Sound is so crystal clear. (5.1)
Extras are abundant and delightful including a Commentary Track with Schwarzeneggers many fond memories. This DVD is a great value and total eye & ear candy!!!!",1001548800,,1820,4.7993630573248405
74079,4,0784010331,"I have to take umbrage at the person who made rude comments about how all the martians mutants with their foam latex appliances looked fake and lowered the quality of the film.  I am part of the team that made all those crummy appliances.  You can find my name in the credits under Rob Bottin. Actually I agree with you and I also think the scene where everyone decompresses and their eyes pop out on stalks then pop back in again when air pressure returns was totally preposterous. Total Recall was one of the last big films where effects were still done with rubber and mechanical animatronics pulled with cables. Many people thought the fat lady head slice gag was done with computers but it was a fiberglass head enlarged many times by soaking a silicone casting of the head in kerosene. The head was sliced with a special saw and a special array of slide bearings rigged with cables were pulled to open the slices. Makeup artists spent hours between shots filling up the gaps in the slices with wax so you could not detect them until the head was pulled apart.  We were very proud of that effect and got applause from the crew when they saw it for the first time.  Other effects did not go so well.  Johnny Cab (Bob Picardo) was supposed to be very animated. His mouth was designed to open wide and form shapes but the servos would not work properly so in the film you see him mostly just bounce his jaw up and down with some minor lip movement. The guy in charge of repairing Johnny Cab stayed up four sleepless days and when it still didn't work was yelled at and mercilessly berated by the FX supervisor and later that day almost died of a bleeding stomach. On the good side Bennie the mutant cab driver has a mutant arm that is a beautiful thing to watch unfold and easily missed if you are not paying attention.  You probably won't hear these uglier stories on the supplemental disc but if you are a fan of Total Recall and like to hear interesting background stories, this is certainly the version of the disc you should buy. Paul Verhoven with his deep German accent and extreme personality combined with Arnolds thick Austrian accent and ego should make for one of the most incomprehensible commentaries in the history of DVDs.  Just kidding. Both are dynamic guys and present the material in an interesting fashion.
  Total Recall is about a miner named Quaid (Arnold Schwartzennegger at the very peak of his career) who seemingly  has a beautiful wife (Sharon Stone)and a nice home. He has a fascination with Mars that disturbs his wife to distraction.  One day he decides to take a simulated vacation from Rekall where memories are implanted in your brain to make you feel you have been on an extended vacation. What Rekall does not know is Quaid is not who he appears to be or who he thinks he is.  Something goes wrong when Rekall unknowingly plants Quaid's own real memories of being a secret agent on Mars into his brain. Quaids brain is temporarily fried and he has to quickly rediscover his true identity before a team of counteragents kill him for what he knows.
  Total Recall was originaly intended to keep the audience guessing about what was real and what was only imagined. However this was dropped with the exception of one memorable scene.  From what I could observe on the set I think Paul Verhoven realized the effects had taken over the movie and there was no point in making this a psychological action thriller. So he resigned himself to play it as a straight up Arnold vehicle packed with slam bang effects and some wicked Verhoven humor. This was too bad because I think many people feel it could have been a much more of a movie than what it was.  Instead this is wild mindless action, violence taken to excess and effects for pure escapism purposes . If this is your cup of tea, than Total Recall may be the thrill ride you are looking for.",1001289600,745,3879,4.512125534950071

74081,4,0784010331,"Ah nothing like a good Paul Verhoeven-directed sci-fi/action bloodfest to get the ol testosterone levels up! Add action star Arnold Schwarzenegger, and youve REALLY got em packing it in to see this one! Bullet wounds you could steer the Titanic through and body counts that rival the casualties incurred at the battle of Gettysburg! And, being on the digital format, you get to see all the carnage and mayhem in much more vivid color and detail than you ever could on VHS! Boo-yah!
All right, enough about the movie itself, lets get down to the good stuff: the special features! Although not quite as extensive as what one would find on the T2 Special Edition DVD, The Special Edition disc of Total Recall has quite a few extra tchotchkes to keep the average action-flick maven fairly entertained after the closing credits roll. Theres the trailers and TV spots, arranged as one continuous presentation, rather than seperately. Theres a behind-the-scenes documentary, where cast & crew recall (doh!) the grind of producing this movie. From the original effort to get TR made that ended in bankruptcy to cast & crew getting sick from Mexico Citys hellish smog (where just about all of the movie was shot), the many grinds and pitfalls of filmmaking are laid bare in this half-our segment. Theres even a five-minute featurette about the future of exploring the surface of Mars, as well as the possibilities of a manned excursion to the red planet. Three storyboard-to-shooting sequences are shown, with storyboard stills shown side-by-side with the filmed scene to show the flick-fan how a scene evolves from concept to finished product.
Sadly, not all of the special features passed muster in my eyes. The Rekall virtual vacations extra was rather stupid and unnecessary. All this feature offers are twenty-second clips of three locales- Martian desert, the Alps, and an ocean beach. To put a fine point on it, the vacation extras are glorified screen savers. Also, the location shoot photo gallery has only a dozen stills, far less than what I expected. The concept art gallery, however, wasn't too shabby.
Then theres the extra feature I both liked and disliked at the same time: the commentary track with Arnie and director Paul Verhoeven. First, Ill start out with what I liked about it. Aside from being entertained by their accents (Paul is Dutch; Arnold is from Austria, a German-speaking nation), I was happy that both of them stayed focused on the movie itself. Ive experienced quite a few feature-length commentaries where the narrator(s) spent a bit too much time talking about other projects theyve done, rather than discussing the actual movie theyve recorded the track for. Fortunately, this wasn't the case here- Paul & Arnie kept their talk about their other films down to a minimum.
 Then theres the big thing I disliked about the track: Verhoevens revelations that a significant portion of the ultraviolent scenes were shortened a bit to avoid an X rating, similar to what he had to do to get RoboCop a more-demographically-acceptable R rating. I was disappointed that he didn't consider restoring these bits to the flick for the special edition DVD, or at least put them on the side as an extra feature. After all, he saw to the restoration of the gorier cutting-room bits in a special edition DVD of RoboCop, as well as the return of several risque moments in the upcoming digital disc release of Basic Instinct. Why he didn't do the same thing with Total Recall will likely be a mystery for some time to come...
Then theres the most unusual feature: the packaging. The disc comes in a squat metal cylinder tin, colored and textured to look like the surface of Mars. The lid even has craters and the Martian face embossed on it! Although its thicker than most DVD cases, its quite a bit more compact surface area-wise. Its also a bit tougher to open than your basic snap case. But there is one upside- the disc isn't held in place by a push-to-release latch, a little feature on regular DVD cases that has a tendency to not wanna let the disc go. Just be careful opening the tin up- you don't want your DVD to suddenly do an imitation of a frisbee!

74082,5,0784010331,"Total Recall is one of those movies I can watch over and over and never get sick of.  It is what every true Arnold fan wants in an Arnold flick.  And aside from being one of Arnold's best films it is a very great sci-fi flick period.

Arnold plays everyman Douglas Quaid, a guy living an average life on the near future earth who is obsessed with the idea of going to Mars(which is colonized).  He decides to go to a futuristic company called Recall, which sells it's customers memories of vacations they did not really take.  Quaid decides to do it and while the salesman is making his pitch he poses the question, ""what is the same about every vaction you have ever taken?"" The answer: You.  So Quaid buys the secret agent package and that is when the action begins.  Suddenly everyone is out to get Quaid and he can't figure it out, all he knows is he has to get his ""a** to Mars.""  He does and the film really takes off with mutants, rebels, women, corruption, double crossing, heavy carnage, planet saving, and Arnold, smack in the middle of all of it.
The story in summary can actually be found within the movie, which is a very unusual plot device, but it works in this film.  The guy at Recall says by the time this is over you will kill the bad guys, get the girl, and save the planet.  So is Total Recall a dream or a reality.  This question is one of the things that makes it such an engaging movie because you don't know.  Really though the best part of this film is Arnold.  He is in tip top form in this film and it is certainly one of his best.  The character allows him all the elements to shine, odds against him, guys always trying to fight him, lots of guns, and terrific one-liners. Paul Verhoeven(Robocop, Basic Instict) has crafted a awesome film.  The set direction is great and it makes the fantastic action that much better.  Sure Verhoeven may get a little carried away with violent nature of his action, but would anyone really want this film any other way?  Not me.
Total Recall is a blast.  On an additional note I just picked up the DVD Collector's Edition and it is a must have for fans.  The commentary with Verhoeven and Arnold is hilarious and the making of's are very well done.  This is one of those films that will become a classic over time because that is what it is, CLASSIC.",1000425600,10,2315,4.314814814814815
74083,5,0784010331,"As an avid fan of both Sci-Fi and Arnold Schwarzenegger, I've managed to log many hours watching both.  Total Recall is one of the greatest examples of how both can be molded together into a tremendous ride.
Arnold portrays a construction worker whose addiction to the planet Mars sends him to a company who implants memories into his head.  During the procedure, he is flung into an inter-planetary conspiracy by the sinister dictator of the Mars colony.  As Douglas Quaid (Arnold characters identity) begins to be accused of being the main cause of the terror, he realizes that an alter-ego has set him up with doom.
Total Recall is directed by Paul Verhoevan (Robocop), a master of the sci-fi world.  His keen eye along with Industrial Light and Magic bring the planet Mars to life as Doug Quaids story leads to an explosive encounter that could change the red planet forever.

74084,5,0784010331,"""Total Recall"" was an anomaly in the slew of films that Schwarzenegger made in that the concept comes from the same well that produced ""Blade Runner"" and the upcoming ""Minority Report"".  As a testament to this film, ""Memento"" has become the most successful independent film of 2001 thusfar.
I'm not going to get into story specifics since most of you already know it.  This is probably Verhoeven's best made in Hollywood.  And it is perhaps the best combination of a science fiction and psychological thriller ever made.  This film draws on story dynamics from ""North by Northwest"".
My review is quickly turning into a plot association to other classics and contemporaries.  So I will just be frank.  I love the aesthetics, the locations, sets, the pure imagination it took to visualize the fantastic story that Philip K. Dick wrote over 20 years ago.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is fantastic, and it provides your imagination the soundtrack it needs to follow the journey of Quaid/Howser.  This film took over 8 years to bring to the screen.  Ronald Shusett, listed as a producer and co-writer, labored from the day he optioned the script to get Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger signed on.  A couple of interesting anecdotes: at one point, David Cronenberg was attached with Richard Dreyfuss attached to star.  I don't imagine it would've been the same sort of action-heavy film it became had Dreyfuss played the white collar worker in earlier drafts.  Arnold signed on, and Quaid was rewritten to be a burly construction worker.
Hope you enjoyed these little tidbits.  For the record, I think the packaging looks way cool.  And I sincerely hope they don't go forward with the sequel.",1000166400,2,1678,4.967741935483871

If only they hadn't used any mutants in the movie. This film could have been more mature and if it was, it might have been a great all-time sci-fi classic.

74091,3,0784010331,"I bought my first DVD sometime in 1998. At the time I had a DVD-ROM in my computer (one of the first on the market by Creative) but not in my home theater (I was still using laser discs). Total recall was among the first 10 DVDs or so that I bought. I saw this movie in the theater and I really liked it, not as much as the Terminator series or running man, but I was entertained nonetheless. I was excited to get it on DVD because I still like to watch it from time to time and I'm still entertained by the movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger is Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who is not happy in his mundane life and wants desperately to investigate his fascination (obsession really) with Mars. His wife Lori, played by Sharon Stone, acts as a deterrent to Douglas's fantasy; which causes him to go to a memory implant agency called Rekall to buy a false memory of a trip to Mars. All his problems seem to start as a direct result of going to Rekall for the memory implant. This is key because this is what keeps us guessing whether or not what's happening to him is real or part of his ""Ego Trip"" package that's supposed to give him the memory of a secret agent. Now, like I said, I've watched this movie many times and there are hints that support both sides, like: The tech that assists the doctor that is going to perform the implant says, ""Blue skies on Mars, that's a new one"". Also, his adventure does seem to follow that memory package to the ""T"". On the other side, there are plenty of clues that support the reality argument, such as the Director sweating when trying to convince him of his delusional fantasy, and Richter (played by Michael Ironside) trying to kill him through out the whole movie. These are the things that make this movie so much fun to watch and never let it get old. This is a good DVD that deserves an overhaul. After seeing and hearing what they did with the recent release of Superman, I would love to experience this movie with a re-mastered digital transference and soundtrack. The amount of action that this movie offers, I feel it's a prime candidate for a special release. I would also love to see a director's cut, I'm curios to see what they actually cut out of the film and if that footage could point the viewers to the correct side (fantasy or reality). As it stands now, the picture is good but could be smother and less grainy at times. The sound is where it needs it biggest improvement! The surround and LFE channel are minimally used (hard to believe in such an action packed movie) and the front 3 could be tightened up and not have the sounds ""leak"" into each channel as much. The vocals could be anchored more to the center channel and have the left and right fronts handle more of the action discreetly. This would be a 5 star movie if they re-released it with, if not all of them, some of these suggested improvements. The way it is, I gave it 3 stars. That being said, I do suggest you buy it, because you will continuously enjoy this movie of the years.",989107200,3,3012,4.342198581560283

74095,5,0784010331,"""Total Recall,"" directed by Paul Verhoeven, is a stunning blend of high-concept science fiction, action, and humor. The script is based on the story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,"" by legendary science fiction writer Philip K. Dick.
In the film, an Earthman named Quaid (a good performance by Arnold Schwarzeneggar) goes to have artificial memories of an exciting vacation to Mars implanted into his brain. But the process goes horribly wrong, and Quaid ends up on Mars in the midst of conspiracy and unrest.
""Total Recall"" contains truly amazing special effects. Combined with the set design and some memorable mutant makeup designs, this is one of the most visually stunning science fiction films ever made. There is plenty of humor in the film, often in the form of snappy one-liners and weird sight gags. The performances are very good; I was especially impressed by Ronny Cox as the ruthless Martian dictator. And everything is well complemented by the big, booming orchestral score by Jerry Goldsmith.

One thing's for sure, Paul Verhoven, director, and Arnold go together very well. This is one of my all time favs, for sure. I can only hope that Arnold and Verhoven (Starship Troopers) can somehow do another Sci-Fi. Johnny Cab has to be one of the best parts that make this movie so cool and different. I just loved the Mars off-world idea, too. It's just a unique movie, much like Predator. The scene where Arnold fights Micheal Ironside on the elevator in the alien device, could've been done different, script-wise, in my opinion. When Arnold ends up holding on to Ironsides' arms after the elevator takes them off, he could've said ""need a hand, or two"" instead of ""...see you at the party, Richter"" That would've made this movie perfect. Oh well, a comic opportunity missed.",977702400,,957,4.60233918128655
74099,5,0784010331,"The 1990's entered with an explosive note, when it came to movies. Like his first science fiction classic, Robocop, Paul Verhoeven would bring audiences another explosive science fiction adventure film. One with plenty of graphic violence, explosive action, three-dimensional characters, spectacular sets, and the like. Most of all, a unique plot twist that leaves the viewer wondering the same question that Arnold schwarzenegger had in the end. Was it all a dream?
Whatever the audience may decide, one thing is for certain. Total Recall is an excellent science fiction action adventure film. One that is both cerebral and violent. Everyone involved in the picture does an excellent job, both on and off the camera. Arnold does a good job, however, this reviewer wishes that Patrick Swayze or Tom Berenger was in the lead heroic role. Michael Ironside, as always does an excellent job as the assasin type, trying to kill Arnold. Ronny Cox does an excellent job playing the cruel colony administrator with his own twisted agenda. Sharon Stone was good too in her role. Her character's death in the middle of the film was well deserved for a villain. And the beautiful Rachel Ticotin did an excellent performance as a revolutionary leader on Mars.
The movie, despite its violent layering, also had a hidden message to it. Information is the most powerful weapon in today's society. And too much information is definately a dangerous thing. The subplot about the Martian machinery was also good, as was Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack of the film.  Definately a classic of the science fiction genre on all levels. If you enjoy science fiction, you will enjoy this film. Another classic from ITC ENTERTAINMENT.",976579200,3,1705,5.111111111111111
74100,4,0784010331,"When Arnold Schwarzeneger made this movie he proved to the audience that he was a clever script chooser. He can make not only action movies, but flics with smart storytelling. We can`t forget the fact that Paul Verhoeven was behind the camera, directing the movie. His histerical view and pace make the story even better. And the best part is the fact that there is room for some tricks. When Arnie`s character goes to rekall, he sets up what he wishes to be his memories. And as you watch his choices, you see that he is setting the whole story of the movie. He chooses to save the whole planet (Mars), he chooses to be a secret agent, he chooses to have a brunette girlfriend. That is all he gets. You could say, of course, that he is only reflecting the memories that he has deep inside his mind. But the moment you say that you are just proving how clever this plot is: even when the movie ends,  you will never know if all these things that happened were really set in the real world or only as a dream. But who cares? What's the difference?",972518400,,1046,4.309644670050761
74101,4,0784010331,"Total Recall had an interesting idea and plot.  It's got some good twists & turns.  I personally like the first half better,  the part on earth.  The villians in this one aren't pathedic like they sometimes are in Arnold movies.  The plot focuses on Arnold going to a place called Recall, for a memory implant on Mars.  After realising something important he decides to actually go to the planet.  This is a pretty good arnold movie.  Not his best, but not his worst either.",970358400,,474,4.559523809523809

That makes it even more impressive that Arnold was able to come out with one tremendous one after another.  Total Recall is perhaps the best, cool action scenes, outer space stuff, lots of violence, tons of plot twists, and classic Arnold lines..possibly the best one ever ""See you at the party Richter"".  The bad guys had cool names like Vilos Cohaagen and were really evil.  The whole concept of reality and dreams and who people really are takes this movie to another level.  A DVD must buy, if you have ever liked an action movie you will like this one",970185600,,677,4.56198347107438

On a more serious note, this is a movie that I loved  on VHS, and cannot wait to upgrade to DVD. A very good plot, a number is  twists, good acting from cast and very good FX for the year. Stand out  performance of this movie for me, Mr Ironside, as cop, Richter. I have  enjoyed a number is Ironside's performances in the past, and hope to in the  future. Arnold plays a good part, and although he will never play a role in  Romeo and Juliet, he plays these roles very well, and in my opinion, there  is no problem with any actor that plays one role better than others.  Christopher Lee anybody?
All in all, a very good story line, and one of  the first movies in my memory to have an intelligent twist. This is a tool  that directors and using more and more (Fight Club, Usual Suspects, Sixth  Sense), which I would much prefer, as guessing the ending of a movie 30  minutes in is getting old really quick.
There are plenty of explosions,  twists and Arnold running around looking confused about the plot to keep  anyone happy. I hear news of a sequel, which I am not sure about, as it can  only cheapen this movie, and remove much of the mystery of this fine work.",965865600,2,1340,4.21259842519685

Schwarzenegger does a good job and the rest of the cast  is made up of character actors(Paul Verhoeven for example) who do their  parts well.  The real meat of this film is it's story.  What starts out as  a simple virtual vacation turns into a struggle for the indepence of Mars.  Without giving too much away, the film keeps you guessing whether anything  is real and you never know who to trust.

Imagine  that someone else wants it all to come back to normal. Now imagine that  Arnold is in the key role. Doesn't that sound fun?
This film has a  science fiction base (if I'm not mistaken it actually takes origin from a  short story), it has sci-fi effects that most of us actually find  enthralling rather than revolting (such as those in Matrix, the special  effects in which turned away quite a lot of people), and it has a human  factor.

7790815,5,0784010331,"This movie is one of the best ""Arnie"" movies hands down.

While all of Arnie's movies ""hold up"" to the changing times, this movie, in particular, is still utterly watchable today. For both new audiences, and those of us Gen Xers who grew up with these gems.

You have to understand that for its time, this movie was exquisitely controversial for its racy edgy mix of sex and what was then GRAPHIC violence, that by today's standards is very tame and cartoonish.  It's Nihilistic and Dystopian view of the human social paradigm of the near future, was a direct reflection of how we as a culture really felt it was going to be.  In many ways, they got it right.  In many ways, they got it wrong.

One of the fun parts is how light, cavalier and almost fun and aloof the movie is about its dystopian representation of the future. Sharing a somewhat lighter and more fun exploration of many themes of transhuman or dystopian corporatism that can be found in most of Philip K Dicks works, as well as many other sci-fi movies of the time.  Unlike the BEAUTIFUL but heavy and almost nightmarish artistic Noir of Blade Runner... Total Recall manages to make dystopian futures look less like a melancholy hell, and more like a fun beer commercial.

Now is this a perfect movie?

I would say that as a combination of time capsule, and a really fun movie with an interesting plot that asks some very fun questions about perception and reality, it is absolutely one of those movies that I think everyone should see once.

It is a classic, and the remake that was made was utterly forgettable in every way.

Failing to even come close to capturing the FLAVOR this movie had.

This movie isn't filet minion, It's a greasy gooey cheeseburger fried up on a local working class burger shops stove filled with all the sinful and bad for you mixtures of grease, and whatever wasn't scraped off the grill.  That burger that you may not be proud of loving, but can't live without.

This is a masterpiece, not because of it's quality and high brow scripting.

This is a comfort food movie, a Quintessential Arnie movie, and a right of passage for young men everywhere  Ahem... (.)(.)(.)",1519603200,,2164,4.581818181818182

This version, with its rollicking, comicbook-style action has always been my favorite, and not just because I enjoy looking at Schwarzenegger's pecks (though you have to admit that he made very nice eye candy). This has a storyline that is exciting and yet has its comic moments as well. Set in the distant future, a construction worker decides to follow his dreams and have the memory of a vacation on Mars implanted in his brain. Unfortunately, the implant procedure triggers memories that he is actually a spy for the Martian government, and he ends up running for his life while still trying to unscramble what's in his head. What follows is the most fabulous series of gloriously choreographed fight scenes, with hardly a breath between them, that has ever graced film. This was released well into Schwarzenegger's acting career, and shows in the polish and ease with which he brings off the character. It also costars Michael Ironside and Sharon Stone, both as agents for the Martian government that are after the erstwhile spy. This has a lot of violence as well as some light nudity, so it may not be suitable for younger viewers. But it is definitely a fun and enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.",1519257600,,1336,4.738197424892704
