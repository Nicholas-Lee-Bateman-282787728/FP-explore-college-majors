For these little inconveniences I am subtracting 1 star.

Having said that, the methodology behind the lessons is extremely well-thought out. The acting of Ms. Johnson is really good and, what's most important, our toddler is absolutely mesmerized and wants to watch it all the time. I don't know why but for this reason alone, we are buying the rest of the series.

I would recommend it as an ESL tool, as well as for toddlers whose native language is English.",1424131200,,683,4.412698412698413
