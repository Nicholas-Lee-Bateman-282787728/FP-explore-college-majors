8360503,5,B002AWM12Q,"OK, what exactly is this? It says vol 2, but 2 is already out and still available. Could this posibbly finally be a vol 3? The ASIN number is new, something is odd here. One can only hope this is the long awaited vol 3 of WC Fields movies. As more info surfaces I'll update my review.

UPDATE 06/29/09:
I bought this  ""new release"" just to see what was going  on here, well it's EXACTLY the same as the earlier release of Vol. 2 right down to the packaging. I have no idea why this exists, but oddly you can can buy it from other vendors here for as low as $15.98, so if nothing else it's a bargain.",1243296000,,599,4.016806722689076
