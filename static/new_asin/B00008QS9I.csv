1859370,5,B00008QS9I,"It is a true Original Very Raw different kind of Love story that Once you watch It will linger in your mind and heart for years.
It's KIM KI DUK's Best work made in the decent production company in Korea.
IT won at Brussels and Venice, Cinemanila International Film Festival, Fantasporto and I think it deserves them.
I always have doubt before watching his film and whenever the movie starts, all of them are gone.
The art, the location, the acting, the original idea are all so great!
I cannot resist to say he is a true genious.

You will never see the fish hook the way you seen before.
The fish hook the guy swallows inside his throat, the woman sews, stabbs inside her vagina and ruins herself self torturing when the guy is trying to escape from the Isle.
THE HOOK, THE HOOK, THE HOOK.

THE ISLE is a remote fishing ground where people go to forget their deepest problems.
It's an unearthly locale crouched in awe-inducing early-morning light. The lodgings are a series of small huts floating on an isolated lake and managed by Hee-Jin, a woman who lives alone without speaking ( I thinks she cannot speak, mute), who sells food, beer, night crawlers, and often her body, to the vacationing fishermen. But she cannot or does not know how to love a man.
 One day, a mysterious man named Hyun-Shik arrives, and before long, the officers came to search for some run away criminals.
In fact, Hyun-Shik killed a woman by accident and is here to kill himself. Seeing them coming, he is desperate and he swallows  a bunch of fish hook inside his throat. When he is almost about to choak to death, Hee-Jin discovers him and saves him.
Then she pulls out all the hooks from his throat. While having this pain, to get rid of the pain, she have sex with him.
That was the first sex with a man with a guy she really loves.
Little by little she is becoming obssessed by him. It is more then love. He means a lot to her.
She has this trauma about man and love. Hyun-Shik has a gift that makes anyone will feel comfortable to him.
There is this hooker also falls in love with Hyun-Shik and she constantly comes to him to get close to him.
Hee-Jin becomes really jealous and separates her from Hyun-Shik and accidentally kills her. She puts her inside the river with a heavy thing attached with her body.
When cops discover the body at last, two of them run away finally to the most deserted place in the riverside.

Key word of Kim Ki-Duk is

1. RAW Expersssion of his feeling.
2. extreme behavior of each charactor that is extreme brutality and bloody violence but not in a horror film way but as human condition cannot be reached.
3. unbeilievablely beautiful nature location with great shots.
4. beautiful music OST.
5.very interesting actors he discovers or he gathered. Most of the main charactors are something he discovered from the flash. They are new comers.
6. Extreme behaviors that charactors does are something will stay in your heart and in your brain for years for sure.

1859523,5,B00008QS9I,"The Isle ( Seom) is the definition of what an arthouse film is. This is an atmospheric portrait set within an isolated world.
Suh Jung (Spider Forest, The Green Chair) is striking as the silent and beautiful Hee-Jin. She runs a quiet lakeside fishing resort. She boats provisions to her patrions such as coffee, fishing supplies and on ocassions her body. She runs into a troubled young man  that comes to resort, the two begin to bond in a sort of non verbal and distant way and interest begin to form between them. However dynamics  between the two of them bring about both consequence, desire and pleasure. I admit, I have pretty far out taste in films and I am an avid fan of Korean cinema. I consider this feature as a work of art rather than just a mere film. Take heed my warning, some scenes in this film are not for the faint of heart. I would hope some of you would appreciate it as much as I did.

1859524,4,B00008QS9I,"A woman who rents out fishing houses on a lake shore, and at night she's a prostitute/Special Ops agent that would put Rambo to shame with her ability to rise out the water and sneak up on people.

Strange but very entertaining film if your looking for something outside the norm. Not sure I'd want to stay at a fishing resort with a woman that could double as a Navy Seal.

I actually enjoyed this film as it wasn't predictable. The movie wasn't about revealing the past it was about corrupt people that find each other. It's interesting that the story takes place at a fishing resort (that's the only way I can describe it). A place where men go to fish by renting out rooms on the lake. They get served breakfast, dinner, coffee, and whatever else they need. The fishing resort is interesting because it seems to only attract adulterers,criminals, and rapist. So I guess the rooms on the lake are pretty cheap.

The plot of the movie is a bit hard to explain as it isn't quite so simple. It's mainly about the life a mute woman lives running a fishing resort/motels/or whatever. There really are no sides to take. Everyone in the movie is equally as guilty. There isn't any hero in this film and not anyone to feel sorry for. The movie is as brutal as the lives these people live. In a way they are all so corrupt that they seem to mutually be able to understand one another. The prostitutes, the men, the owner etc. This is life for them and this is what they consider to be normal. The only one who seems out of place is the man in the yellow room. He seems to be concerned with something else other than fishing and the local prostitutes, and that's what makes him interesting. Unfortunately he's just as bad as everyone else. He has his secrets and lustful desires too that he carries out but just not as openly as the other men.

He's a bad guy parading as a good guy, and that's what makes it so ironic. No one is innocent in this innocent setting.

There's lots that you can get out of the movie by watching it. I don't recommend it for people who complain about everything or can't go into a movie with an open mind. It's a violent and vulgar movie so be forewarned.",1299110400,,2177,4.339066339066339
1859525,5,B00008QS9I,"I took a chance on this film. Asian flick, horror to thriller to romance, are hit or miss. This is a hit. I mean a homerun. The characters are put into impossible situations, but not unrealistic. Our female lead finds life as a lakefront manager and prostitute rewarding enough to continue. Our male lead, a one time upstanding member of the community, needs a place to hide or die (suicide) The couples developing love is simple and innocent. Not innocent in the same way The Road Home presents love (hint-try it) but pure compared to the lives that now face the two main characters.
This flick sound like a chic flick, but girls---beware of the use of fish hooks for expressing emotion.
Excellent!",1293580800,,699,4.691056910569106
1859526,5,B00008QS9I,"This film is beautiful and intriguing.

It defies any simple classification into the usual categories of films. Some reviewers call it a ""horror"" story, which it is not. It is in fact much more than that. It presents madness in a beautiful seductive way which is much more true to real life. The story is told ""straight"". There is no attempt to explain what one is seeing in this film, which adds to the intrigue. This is a great film. I have watched it many times and will continue to do so. One cannot get the true essence of this story with only one viewing.

A masterpiece, to my mind!

There are no laughs and little sexual tittilation going on in this work. Bits of it stick in one's mind, however.

This is not just another Asian exploitation film. Watch it at you peril!

1859527,5,B00008QS9I,"Once again South Korea amazes us with another genre busting film. ""The Isle"" totally pulled me in. It is a dark toned, provocative film.

1859528,4,B00008QS9I,"I've always been a fan of Kim Ki-Duk's. I've reviewed most of his films and for some reason, I haven't reviewed my first experience from this outcast Korean director. Kim has been labeled an outcast because his films are methodical, violent and his style usually deals more on themes and imagery rather than its narrative. ""The ISLE"" (2000) is a beautiful film, emotionally violent, horrific and it defies a solid definition of genre. It is a story about obsession and the examination of relationships. I'll get right to the point: if you can't stand sequences of animal abuse and if you prefer a more direct form of filmmaking then ""The Isle"" may not be for you. Kim's films are usually for the esoteric few who appreciate and understand this method in filmmaking.

Hee-jin (amazingly beautiful Jung Suh, also known as Seo Jeong) is a supposedly mute boat keeper. She supplies bait and food to the relaxing fishermen in the lake by day, and at night, she sells her body to the selfsame fishermen. One day, a man named Hyun-Shik (Yoo-Suk Kim) arrives, who supposedly came to fish but he is a man on the run from the law and is actually considering suicide. Hee-jin grows curious with Hyun-Shik and seemed to have developed a fondness for him. She watches him from the shore when he finally decides to commit suicide and she intervenes. The two begin to form a strange bond that may be beyond our basic instincts.

The little fishing village is a perfect backdrop for writer/director Kim Ki-Duk's film that borders on being a twisted fable and a conventional horror film. Now, even with its scenes of violence and animal mutilation, it is  not a horror film; rather, it is a drama that tackles violent and obsessive behavior full of emotional content in a very direct way. When Hee-jin becomes abused by the fishermen after having sex with her, she responds with a violent fury that almost seems psychotic when she takes her revenge. ""The ISLE"" has very limited dialogue, the two lead characters hardly speak to anyone but their actions more than speak for themselves. It also has the most disturbing sequences with a fish hook that I've ever seen.

The movie is an examination of relationships between men and women. Kim is very fascinated with gender and relationships so he puts this factor in center stage. The two actually have a ""Lynchian"" type love affair. When Hyun-Shik tries to force himself on Hee-jin and she refuses, she sends him a prostitute that he befriends and she becomes extremely jealous. The sex scene between the two is erotic but at the same time, twisted. The slightly psychotic Hee-jin transforms into a romantic one when she is in Hyun's presence. Actress Jung Suh is thoroughly convincing as her character swings from one emotional mood to the next. No wonder she has become renowned for her role in this film. As the unusual bond develops between the two, their attachment to each other grows, both physically and emotionally. When one is hurt, the other responds in kind. Enter the Fish Hook.

Kim also shows just how the marginalized world of the lake operate; each gender is dependent on one another. Men are fishermen, pimps, criminals and cops. Women clean and provide care, sex and amusement. Both sexes are also potential adulterers which gives them common ground.  In this world, both men and women play typical roles, and while in this world, men are considered the stronger of the two, but they are also very reliant on women. Hee-jin provides the boat, the only means of transport, food, to clean and sexual services. The relationship between the two is dependent on one another. Men are rendered incomplete without women as are women are also fairly incomplete without men.

There are subtle metaphors in the film and the key images in the film are enhanced by stunning visual flair. The shots become frozen in time as certain key elements and themes are driven home by visual manipulation. The film is a little slower paced that allows the viewer to properly absorb its sequences. The film does feel a bit longer than it actually is because the camera lingers at times. The direction and storytelling depends on its imagery.

THE ISLE is a worthwhile film and has become among my favorites by Kim Ki-Duk. Those who prefer straight-forward storytelling will be alienated but those who love challenging cinema with an ""art house"" thought provoking style will be rewarded. Kim doesn't really explain the climax in a conventional manner and leaves it to the viewer's interpretation. Kim excels in the surreal that may frustrate viewers but his style is definitely powerful. The film is well balanced but requires patience in order to be appreciated. Those with the correct mindset will be rewarded with ""The Isle"".

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  - stars]

Note: The U.S. release is not the uncut edition with extended scenes of lizard and fish mutilation and an unexplained dog abuse. I own the uncut edition. Websites list the woman as Hee-jin but her name is never really mentioned in the film.",1215820800,20,5027,4.833720930232558

Although the story is edgy, it explores the theme of what unrequited love is in that part of the world, to which most western viewers might find strange or even outrageous.  Unless you get into the asian psyche of how it feels to be fatally attracted to someone, you'd probably not be able to fully understand this movie.

1859561,4,B00008QS9I,"This is your typical Korean drama:  Misfits of society who are unable to cope with the realities of life choose an escape.

The anti-hero in the Isle for whatever reason decides to mark the final moments of his life in a fishing lake.  These fishing lakes have little shack on water where one can rent them for as long as one desires for a fee.  These little shacks on water is the symbolic theme of the Isle.  Separated from the surrounding world, these little rafts serve as a world within a world.  For the anti-hero, a new life begins.  However, tragedy awaits.  In the end, he is unable to sever himself from his previous life and looking forward, he cannot live through the life on the raft.

As one can imagine, thses characters are almost always pathetic.  Yet, one cannot help but sympathize with them.  This is where Director Kim Ki Duk is at his best.  He transforms their frality, either physically or emotionally, and their ultimate demise into characters who are very human.  Underneath the rage lies a serene sense of inevitablity that we are all mortal.

All of Director Kim's movies are twisted, some more than others.  However, he somehow manages to cut through the haze, usually the doldrums of daily life, and finds beauty in unconventional angles.

Sorrow and failure are major themes of Korean dramatic movies.  I think this genere presents itself this way to the audience in effect to show that there is another path that one should take to avoid such tragedy.

I digress.  Back to the Isle.  The Isle is a twisted, sick movie.  Yet, at the same time, it is moving and romantic.  This is the world of Kim Ki Duk.  Enjoy at your own peril.",1161993600,2,1661,4.574829931972789

1859563,5,B00008QS9I,"A long time fan of Italian giallo and artsy thrillers of all types, I have recently discovered the exquisite joys of Asian cinema, which is setting a new standard for imagination.

Since the advent of video, the world of cinema has split into two camps of production. The Hollywood studios increased spending on select ""event"" movies in hopes of continuing to lure audiences to the big screen, and set up indie wings to compete with the lower budget product in the straight-to-video markets.

Unfortunately the big budget movies quite often suck, churned out according to tired formulas under the hands of packaged talent lucky enough to have secured the strongest agency representation.  On the flip side, quantity has supplanted quality in the video arena. In the U.S., anyone who can slap together a story shootable on the lowest budget possible is most likely to win financing.

As a result, cable channels and DVD racks are filled with boring epic productions, usually based on comic books (excuse me, graphic novels), or cheesy low budget rip-offs of earlier, better movies.

Thank God for the Asians!! While Hollywood was churning out a spew of glossy retreads in the horror genre, ranging from the blasphemously horrible ""THE HAUNTING"" to the ho-hum ""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"", filmmakers from Japan to Thailand were dishing up fresh and original fare like THE GRUDGE, THE EYE, SCARECROW, and other flicks which took genre movies in bold new directions.

THE ISLE is a kinky thriller which proves that low budget does not have to mean cheese. Blessed with a very unique and cinematic location, it weaves a haunting spell with its subtly intriguing twists and revelations.

This is not a film for weak stomachs, however. Puritans should steer clear of it. There are extremely graphic images, and the characters are demented. Their most sympathetic qualities spring from human weakness. Viewers imprinted with Judaeo-Christian moral standards will find it hard to love anyone in this movie.

More sophisticated viewers, open to the full spectrum of emotions and human behavior, will find plenty to like about this film. The story pulls you in, and the imaginative twists and turns of the character interaction are fascinating. Each new arrival at the tiny resort brings new anticipations, and they're paid off well.

Hedonists will appreciate the sensuous, remote, misty setting, the sexy actors and costumes, and the intelligent direction which milks every frame for beauty and drama.

Purely on the basis of cinematic achievement, I would give this 10 stars if I could.",1142467200,9,2576,5.126491646778043
1859564,4,B00008QS9I,"I enjoyed this very much - such a relief from the unremitting body counts, computer graphics and car chases of so many current films.  Gory bits?  Yes, but then again, mild compared with the modern action film's ""how to blow as many people to bits in as short a time as possible"" philosophy. While the treatment of animals may seem shocking to western eyes, I'm not sure the director set out with that intention. Anyone who has travelled a little in the Far East will know that attitudes differ considerably.  (Whether people really do eat live monkey brains, I don't know, but I've seen them eating live prawns, and half-live fish).  What's it all about?  Man vs woman?  Mankind vs the ""spirit of nature""?

1859567,4,B00008QS9I,"I'll try not to add comments that others have already made.

One thing I'll say is that it is not the horror flick that many make the film out to be.  Grow up!  Yes there were some scenes that make you ""shiver""  but this is not a film just going around maiming animals and characters that like S&M as other reviews tend to portray.  Maybe I grew up watching too many horror movies or else reading all these reviews about the gore and violence built up my expectations of what I was to encounter, or else I just watch too much of the daily news.  Whatever, the reason, don't go watch the film thinking it's going to be an all out horror show.

It's about emotions conjured up through anger, betrayal, and love.  It hits the sensitive areas of relationships.  Put yourself into the character's place.  How would you feel and what would you do?  (Maybe not the fish hooks.)

As far as all the PETA comment, (of which I'm not a member) they cry foul over eating a chicken!  Worse stuff happens over here in the US.  Keep in mind it's a different culture you're seeing in the film.  In Vietnam and other parts of Asia they eat dogs.  Other parts of the world may frown on us eating chickens and cows and pigs.  We don't have to ""prepare"" our animals.  We just buy it packaged and ready to cook.  The gross stuff is done for us.  The so called gross animal scenes are fast and the camera doesn't ""loom"" on the animal so it's an inconsequential part of the scene.  So what, they put it in a film.  I've seen documentaries on how steak and pork chops are prepared and no one says it's a no-no to show.

The frog incident-She knocked out and skinned a frog to eat/feed to the guys bird.  She didn't skin it first when it was alive.  It's not like we don't eat meat over here.  Her economic status didn't allow her to go to the local Shaws Market and get one skinned and trimmed.  You see last year what people did to chickens being raised for I think KFC?  They were stomping and kicking them for the fun of it.  On the internet I saw a clip of kids putting a live kitten in a cage, pour gas all over it then light the poor thing on fire.

The fish incidents- If you've ever prepared a fish its no big deal.  Yes, it was mean to hack up a fish (guys was pissed) or to run current through it (lady was pissed) but it was trying to convey the anger the characters had in them.  Same with the lady slapping the dog around.  She didn't beat it to death.  She was mad it didn't want to go out on the boat and boat house, plus she wasn't very happy.  (Although it doesn't make it right.)

Fresh sushi-  Can't get it any fresher than that.  If you watch the movie, the fish didn't die as it was caught by the male main character later, then set free, to show his pity for it.

Yes, the fish hook scenes were not pleasant to watch but a) the guy didn't swallow the hooks that far as evidenced by the lady taking them out with a pair of pliers, and b) you don't see her inserting the fish hooks into any place, just up her dress.  There's no clear shot of what she does.  She did bleed quite a bit but wouldn't you if you did that?  I've seen much worse in horror flicks and the news.

Anyway, there's lots more to this film than just the gore and animal mistreatment.  Go see the movie with a blank slate and you'll like it better.  But the ending is a little curious.",1123113600,4,3351,4.127131782945736
1859568,3,B00008QS9I,"The Isle (Ki-Duk Kim, 2000)

I am powerfully attracted to the idea of a lake such as that depicted in The Isle existing, so long as the people would stay away from it.

The Isle tells the story of Hee-Jin (Jung Suh), a mute woman who lives on the edge of a lake, renting out floats (wonderful little things that are kind of like beach houses that float out in the middle of the lake), and selling food, bait, and her body to the people who rent them. She becomes obsessed with the inhabitant of one of the floats, and the two of them fumble their way into a love/hate relationship.

It's a very simple plot, but it's done in a novel way here. The film contains almost no dialogue (even less than the film I use as the benchmark of great films where almost no one talks, Phantasm), instead relying on shots of the scenery, and the actors going about their business, to relay the story. Most of the dialogue is delivered by people who are to wrapped up in themselves to care about what's around them; probably an overly facile explanation, but it seems to fit. Hyun-Shik, the man with Hee-Jin becomes obsessed, speaks only when necessary; she, of course, does not speak at all.

There were a few times I wished Kim had paced a scene differently (usually faster), and there are a few scenes of violence which are likely to sicken or shock viewers with weaker stomachs, but overall, The Isle is a beautiful film to watch. Just don't watch it with someone you love. ***",1112572800,2,1464,4.411111111111111
1859569,1,B00008QS9I,"I have never written an online reveiw and never intended too, but this film was so terrible, brutal and boring (which is an amazing combination in itself) that as a service to other people who enjoyed this directors later film ""spring, summer, fall, winter...and spring"" I felt compelled to issue this warning.

  This is perhaps the worst film I have seen in years.  In this film you will see the following: several live fish caught, thrown onto a dock and hacked to pieces with a knife as the flop around, a bird drown in its cage, a woman insert fish hooks into her vagina and yank on the fish line to set them in, a man deficate (shot up from below so you miss nothing) another fish thrown on the floor and having battery cables attached, a dog beaten, women slapped and degrated, and a frog having his brains bashed in as he is slammed against a rock and then skinned.

  And in spite of all this sadistic stuff going on, I was bored. This is truly a piece of crap. I will not even address the plot as it is already reveiwed many time. But if you are looking for horror, look elsewhere, every death, man and animal, is shot in a slow drawn out distant way. Not scary.

 Is there nudity and sex, yes shot in the same ditracted slow boing way.

 I am not sayiny that this movie isn't making some kind of statement, just that the statement is brutal and slow and shallow.

 Oh and I forgot to mention the fish that is cut into sushi and eaten while alive, but not enough to kill it, and then allowed to swim away with huge gashes of flesh missing on either side.

 I am not some peta vegan liberal tree hugger but the cruelty inflicted (not FX) on the animals in this film just to try to fill up boring gaps in this boring piece of crap is disgusting.

 There are better films than this to see, try ""vertcal ray of the sun"" for instance.",1112486400,15,1839,4.238505747126437
1859570,1,B00008QS9I,"THE ISLE takes place entirely on a remote lake outfitted with small floating cabins where folks can go to fish, screw or commit suicide.  Oh, wait, that last one isn't in the brochure.  Nevertheless, one man arrives with just that intention, though he has some difficulty following through with it.  He catches the eye of the lake's proprietor, an obsessive woman who becomes insanely jealous when he spends time with one of the local prostitutes who seems genuinely interested in him.

Is the woman some kind of water spirit?  What past secret is haunting the man?  And why doesn't anyone who visits the lake know how to swim?  (Which begs another question: Why are they there?  Don't they have hotels in Korea?)

Jealousy and murder ensue.  People start putting fish hooks where they were never intended to go.  And numerous animals are tortured, mutilated, and killed in close detail for no discernible reason.  For all this, the movie is painfully slow.  THE ISLE is a cruel and disgusting yet boring film with no plot and where nothing anybody does makes any sense.

1859591,5,B00008QS9I,"There are already quite a few reviews detailing what makes this movie great, so I won't add too much here to elaborate and just give my voice to echo this movie's praise.

Kim ki-duk is one of a few excellent directors who's emerging from Korea recently (Chanwook Park being another, but unfortunately none of his movies are available here yet, probably because Hollywood is set on remaking them eventually).  I've only seen one other of his movies, BAD GUY, which is a lot like THE ISLE in structure, story, and symbolism--and is equally as good.  Both movies show a mastery over the beautiful, the poignant, and the slowburn.

Despite some people complaining the movie drags, I think each and every scene is so minimalistically poetic and vital that not a single frame is boring.  What Kim can portray so simply, subtley, and beautifully, raises every second of this movie above your typical arthouse flick.  From what I've seen, he's a director like no other.  To so easily combine the grotesque, violent, bizarre, and heart-stoppingly beautiful so skillfully is rare (Miike comes to mind--but he's like Kim ki-duk with ADD).

Certainly someone to watch out for in the future.",1105833600,5,1179,4.91919191919192
1859592,5,B00008QS9I,"Thanks to the recent boom in Asian horror films and their American remakes, specifically films like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge,"" we are starting to see movies from other countries in that region. Exhibit A is the South Korean film ""The Isle."" Before watching this film I didn't even think South Korea made films let alone distributed them beyond their borders. The words ""South Korea"" conjure up memories of ""M*A*S*H*"" and the Korean War, the demilitarized zone and Kim Jong-Il. What those words do not bring to mind is cinema. But here's a movie, and a pretty disturbing one at that, which easily compares with the grotesqueries coming out of Japan and Hong Kong. Compares, that is, not in a particularly gory way but in the emotionally and psychologically devastating way one usually sees in a Takashi Miike picture. In fact, I began mentally comparing ""The Isle"" with Miike's ""Visitor Q"" and ""Audition"" due to what I saw as a similarity in themes dealing with the inability of people to connect with one another in healthy ways. What the heck is going on over in Asia that gives birth to film after film loaded with alienation and damaged human beings?

""The Isle"" wallows in enigmatic symbolism and bleak images. The entire picture revolves around an isolated lake up in the mountains where people go to fish. A very attractive mute young lady, Hee-Jin (Jung Suh), works as the caretaker of the lake, a job that entails renting little colored floating cabins to guests and supplying said cabins with whatever the visitors need. In some cases, the men on these little getaways require quite a bit from Hee-Jin, a requirement that she readily acquiesces to for the right price. She's not without a vindictive streak, however, and will punish anyone who mistreats her by tipping them into the water or through other mean-spirited tricks. Hardly a mean thing to do, really, unless you cannot swim, which is what happens to one jerk when he fails to do right by Hee-Jin. Actually, most of the people visiting the lake are jerks of one sort or another. Even the harridans and their violent employer, who show up at the water's edge from time to time at the request of a guest, are decidedly unfriendly. Most of the film focuses on Hee-Jin's seemingly mundane daily activities and the people who visit the lake. Everything changes when a depressed loner by the name of Hyun-Shik arrives on the scene. He rents a floating cabin and stays there much longer than anyone else does, and it's obvious he isn't that interested in fishing. The stranger piques Hee-Jin's interest.

Through a few quick flashbacks, the movie reveals that Hyun-Shik is actually a man on the run, a fugitive from the law for a crime he committed prior to arriving at the lake. In his other life he was a police officer, but he was also an extremely jealous, possessive man who killed his significant other. During his tenure on the water, Hyun-Shik generally keeps to himself until Hee-Jin gradually intrudes on his life. She introduces him to the wonders of fishing and rescues him after the police turn up at the lake looking for fugitives. In an effort to escape the long arm of the law, and since he's trapped on a float in the middle of a lake with no means to reach the shore, Hyun Shik swallows a bundle of fishhooks in an effort to escape incarceration. He needn't have gone to such extremes, however, as the police find another man to arrest and leave. Oops. Talk about an overreaction of a lifetime! Fortunately, Hee-Jin powers up in her little boat and nurses the ex-police officer back to health. The two then strike up a tempestuous relationship that leads to murder, Hee-Jin's own encounter with fishhooks, and a truly enigmatic conclusion that left me scratching my head in confusion.

I spent more time paying attention to the atmosphere of the film than I did trying to decipher the characters' motivations. The lake is a grim, brooding body of water located in the middle of nowhere, often shrouded with fog and haze. The little floating cabins and a few of the people who come to stay for a few days represent the only real color seen in the film. What does that mean? Well, perhaps it hints at the nature of Hee-Jin's and Hyun-Shik's self-imposed isolation from the rest of the world. More interesting is the symbolism of the fishhook atrocities, a particularly interesting symbolism seeing as how it is tied to the purpose of those who come to the lake. The customers stay to catch fish, but Hee-Jin and Hyun-Shik catch each other by using emotional pain as bait. Each responds to the other more directly after the hooks dig into the other's flesh, realizing that they are both similar in outlook and nature. That their relationship results in the taking of a life shouldn't be too surprising considering how damaged both of these people are. ""The Isle"" means something like that--I don't know. My experience with films like this tells me that those viewers without knowledge of the culture in question (re: me) probably won't grasp the finer points of the plot.

The DVD version of ""The Isle"" includes a music video, a making of featurette, interviews with the cast and the director, a trailer, and trailers for ""Tuvalu,"" ""Merci Pour Le Chocolat,"" and ""The Trial of Henry Kissinger."" Although I am sure I missed a lot of what the movie tried to achieve, one cannot deny the beauty of this film. It's highly unlikely an American studio will remake this depressing picture, though; they like material with a lot of flash and fire, which makes ""The Isle"" far too subtle for their tastes.",1104710400,20,5574,4.743298969072165
1859593,5,B00008QS9I,"The fish in the sea live to find food for survival, reproduce to maintain the species, and avoid deadly encounters while traveling, sleeping, and defecating.  The strong maintain the species through alienating, or killing the weak as they are perceived as a threat to the survival of the group.  These notions, heavily reflected by Darwinism, are also the basic idea of human existence by which many people live as they go about their daily habits.  However, these basic needs for maintaining the human race do not reflect on how emotions can color and bring texture to what otherwise could be a dull gray existence.  For example, humans feel ecstatic as they make love, people feel pain when something penetrates their skin and enters the flesh, and people have happy memories of pleasant smells of good food as it brings to mind moments of comfortable survival.  These feelings of ecstasy, pain, and happiness among many more feelings are present in order to encourage behavior that will keep the individual and the species alive much like Pavlov's dogs salivated when they heard the bell prior to each meal that was served.  In the Isle a bell rings whenever a fish is on the hook.

The Isle begins with a man, Hyun-Shik (Yoosuk Kim), that arrives to a remote lake, possibly connected to the ocean, with what seems to be all of his belongings.  A birdcage with a bird is among the items that Hyun-Shik brought, which has a symbolic meaning as he removes himself from land by renting a small hut floating on a raft.  There is no connection with land, except by a woman and her old boat, but it seems to be what Hyun-Shik seeks as he begins to dwell on his wrongdoings that led him to seek shelter at this remote location.  In deep contemplation and agony Hyun-Shik considers to commit suicide as he has apparently killed someone of importance in a moment of vengeance.  It becomes an overwhelmingly internal struggle for Hyun-Shik whether to pull the trigger, or not, as he weeps out his anguish.

The other main character is an emotionless woman, Hee-Jin (Jung Suh), who watches over the lake and the inhabitants of the many huts that she rents out.  In many ways Hee-Jin behaves like a fish as she nurtures her visitors as if they were her babies.  She brings them food and frequently ventures to the cabins at night to give herself to the visiting men.  There is no emotional connection for Hee-Jin with the men, it merely seems to be something she does for some unknown reason as she does not say anything, or ask for anything in return.  However, one of the men that Hee-Jin copulated with insults her by throwing money in the lake, which is an analogy that expresses the man's way of displaying how it was a waste of time and effort.  In anger Hee-Jin acts out in the middle of the night while the man who offended her is about to make a nightly toilet visit into the lake.

When a person is aware that he or she cannot experience compassion, feelings, or emotions it becomes a quest to conquer what most people find to be an ordinary experience in order to remain strong.  Hee-Jin discovers Hyun-Shik suicidal and weeping in a pathetic display, yet she feels something, which she cannot define.  Hee-Jin begins to explore what she felt by killing frogs and fish, which she attempts to feed to Hyun-Shik's bird.  In loneliness Hee-Jin drinks alcohol without effect as she approaches Hyun-Shik with the bottle, which the man presumes to be a sexual invitation.  As a result, Hee-Jin hits Hyun-Shik and returns to land as she insults him by hiring a prostitute for him, but she discovers something called envy.  This leads the unbalanced couple into an eye wrenching display of bizarre self-disfigurement as they strive to remain within a tormenting relationship that is embedded in pain and suffering when Hyun-Shik seeks distance.

The director, Ki-duk Kim, portrays Hee-Jin and Hyun-Shik in an internal struggle where the affection for one another expands as they discover more about each other through gut wrenching scenes.  The artistic background of Kim is evident as the Isle becomes a stunningly beautiful film to view as several scenes depict skilled framing of each scene.  It should be mentioned that Kim's later films Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring (2003) and Samaria (2004) display his visual cunning as they also offer the audience visual analogies that are planted within the film for the audience to ponder.  Some of these seeds that Kim sows within the visuals of the Isle display several notions that should be be reflected upon such as existentialism, Darwinism, moral issues, and emotions.  Kim succeeds efficiently to grasp the audience and force them to ponder, as the film leaves most of what is depicted to the audience's own interpretation.",1104278400,35,4783,4.807081807081807

It's like a James M. Cain novel filmed by Peter Greenaway.  I think for the most part it succeeds, though I have docked it a star for occasional lapses of taste (scenes of people defecating, for example).
