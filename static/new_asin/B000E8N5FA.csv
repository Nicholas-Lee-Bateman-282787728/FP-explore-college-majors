8107436,1,B000E8N5FA,"This could be helpful for new coaches who have not become familiar to the game.
This depicted only a small training session which was poor. Not worth the money that it was purchased at....",1459209600,,188,4.5588235294117645
8107437,4,B000E8N5FA,The video is very helpful in coaching the basic technical skills of the game. The coach made both positive coaching points and correction coaching points regarding what Ali did in demonstrating the various techniques.,1223078400,,217,5.411764705882353
8107438,4,B000E8N5FA,"This is the third soccer coaching video I've watched, and I'd say it's the best by quite a margin.  The techniques covered are some of the more difficult to get kids to understand, so it was very helpful to see them demonstrated from a couple different angles and then explained in understandable language.  I've referenced this video several times with my team, and I even loaned it to my assistant coach so he could watch it with his daughter.",1193616000,,445,4.620253164556962
8107439,4,B000E8N5FA,Offered some good coaching points to help ensure the basics are revisited.  Often we coaches attempt to try to move forward too fast before the foundations are set.  For an experienced coach it might likely be too basic although I like to review the basics from time to time.  For a club this would be a great reference DVD for the library for new coaches to strip away all the noise and see the two or three key points to hone in on to master fundamental skills.,1176336000,,463,4.2988505747126435
8107440,5,B000E8N5FA,"I have a near ten year old daughter who loves soccer but never has had a coach over the past few years that knew or could lay a solid technical skills foundation. She had the passion but not the know how and I not being a soccer player added no value..Until I received this DVD.  Wow! The coach and Aly Wagner (U.S. Women's National team Member and 2004 Gold Medal Team Member) are awesome.  She is seriously talented and the instructionals modest pace, great angles, modest repetition and superb broadcast quality of each technique are awesome. The DVD covers all the basics and then some: dribbling, receiving, shooting, passing and heading. This DVD is going to take us to the next level and beyond.  It's a must have for any parent wanting to get involved in the development of their child's soccer skills and enjoyment.  The Bonus Backyard training section is an amazing watch.",1175558400,,882,4.707792207792208
