8245350,4,B0012DUD88,Not the best video quality for sure but I liked it because it showed several places I have not seen in other videos on New Zealand.,1468540800,,131,4.076923076923077
8245351,4,B0012DUD88,"Has a different flavor, in not being dubbed or written for a 'standard' U.S. audience. So it gave you more of a sense that you were there.",1445644800,,138,4.148148148148148
8245352,4,B0012DUD88,"I own several DVDs related to natural beauty in New Zealand.

This production is the best that I've seen thus far in terms of content and production quality.

The only drawback is that this content needs to be shown in high def on a Blu-ray production.",1385510400,,252,4.456521739130435
8245353,2,B0012DUD88,"This video must have been made in the early 80's and by the time it was turned digital the color was very washed out.  An over fascination with volcanism and hot springs it lacks many of the more amazing off the beat features.  6 weeks in New Zealand and we saw so much more than shown in this video.  A drawn out poor quality video that does not give New Zealand the justice it deserves.  That said, if you do enjoy this you will love the country.  Get the books NZ Frenzy available on Amazon and go visit this incredible place!",1359244800,,529,4.198019801980198
