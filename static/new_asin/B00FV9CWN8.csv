Last month, I reviewed a film titled GUT that dealt with a mans descent into hell after watching a snuff film.  As I mentioned in that review, the concept of snuff films has been around for a long time, but much debate still exists in regard to their authenticity.  Director Mariana Peralta does not try to convince us SNUFF 102 is real, but instead spins a tale outside of the film while showing us the snuff video footage within it.  This unique perspective makes SNUFF 102 a horrific and unforgettable journey into voyeurism hell.

I have to confess:  I was a bit squeamish going into this one.  Given the films reputation for its brutality and gore, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was hoping for an entertaining experience, but I was honestly not prepared for what I was about to see.  Many of the scenes in the film are hard to watch, and I had to look away a couple of times.  This is a testament to the amazing talent of the production team; they do a stunning job in creating realism here.

SNUFF 102 is shot on low-budget cameras, which creates a grainy picture and an almost throwback feel to the film.  I was put off with this at first, but quickly embraced this concept, as it actually lends credibility to the movie and the atmosphere it is trying to create.  After a short while, I had no problems believing I was actually watching a snuff film (inside of the actual film).  My sole complaint about this is that there are some scenes that are TOO grainy and dimly lit to be impactful.

The acting is really good, with the three tortured women giving outstanding performances as they endure unspeakable acts at their tormenters hands.  I have never seen any of them prior to this film, but I would daresay they will do well with any future roles they procure.

The special effects in SNUFF 102 are ruthlessly good.  Gore-hounds will certainly be satisfied with this one, as theres plenty of carnage to go around.  The three woman are tortured mercilessly and subjected to horrors that can barely be described.  The special effects team is to be commended and praised for their efforts, as they create a hellish nightmare that will haunt your mind for many sleepless nights to come.

I do not want to say anything else, other than beware of this film if you are sensitive in any way.  One of the women is pregnant, therefore the scenes with her are especially difficult to watch.  But the whole concept behind the film is difficult.  In addition to the torture, it addresses the concept of societys view-for-fun mindset and how messed up this is making us.

SNUFF 102 is a win for me, but make sure you can stomach its contents before you give it a look.  It is definitely not for everyone, but its an amazing piece of cinema if you can make it through.  The film is available now if you want to check it out.",1424736000,20,2898,4.4600760456273765
6032387,5,B00FV9CWN8,pretty good way better than august underground series real as you can get for fake snuff with acting i liked it..,1397865600,9,113,4.428571428571429
8618740,1,B00FV9CWN8,"This is such a joke I cant believe they put that stupid warning on the cover of DVD this is so fake, sure they make it bloody really making it look real.  I hated how they make it look from grainy hand held camcorder and the dialogue was weak.  I was excepting more then what I saw, this just bloody mess and screams.",1523923200,,317,4.015873015873016
8618741,1,B00FV9CWN8,"An ugly experience and a movie that no one should see. There is footage of animal torture on a monkey and a pig. A pregnant woman gets kicked to death. I'm not sure why someone would make this movie. I expect that if I looked in to it, I'd find the director saying that he was trying to make a non-violent statement or something like that. I rarely if ever believe that rationale, and I don't believe that anyone is really changed into a better person by watching things like this.",1493510400,4,481,4.2967032967032965
8618742,3,B00FV9CWN8,"I really love the genre... I really wanted to love this film. Unfortunately it is a bit of a let down... without giving anything away the music during certain scenes should never have been edited in, the film lost most of its power as a result. It will definitely disturb the average viewer... I enjoyed it but was left wanting more of what the title of the film suggests overall. As far as production the use of about 100 different filters and effects laid over the film makes the whole thing feel very overdone and dry. These films should always be raw... whereas this was obviously made in the editing room. Don't cross it out definitely belongs in the collection!",1480032000,5,667,4.566666666666666

8618744,1,B00FV9CWN8,"while this film has a promising premise & a lot of visual interest for horror buffs, the sound track is the most irritating screeching crap i have ever been subjected to - & i have a cockatoo!

all you hear through the entire film is what sounds like a rhythmic, halting, scratched-vinyl recording of static. when the constant & vaguely musical cacaphony stops, all dialog, screams, even 'silent' parts are heard the same way ... it sounds like ""eh eheh eh eheh eh eheh eh eheh eh eheh eh"", over & over & over.

luckily there's subtitles or it would be utterly unwatchable; with the level of distraction caused by that noise, i couldn't figure out what the hell was going on ... i had to watch it again muted to discover there's really a story.",1460505600,4,744,4.463235294117647
8618745,5,B00FV9CWN8,"At one level this is obviously a horrifying subject. However at another level it is great cinema: engaging cinematography, terrific feminist fightback story under extreme conditions and high a octane emotional experience. If you can take the horror, terrific film.",1456963200,,264,5.625
8618746,3,B00FV9CWN8,"Considering that this movie was made on what appears to be a shoestring budget in the nicer parts of South America, or so I would imagine, it's not a bad film.  Some of the music and sound design isn't really as bad as some have portrayed it in other reviews, kind of modern and edgy.  The effects are top-notch considering what the production staff had to work with.  The actors admittedly had to go through hell to get some scenes cut and the director may be a bit more sadistic than he would have everyone else believe.  Not a bad exploitation or ""torture-porn"" movie.",1456790400,3,571,4.461538461538462
8618747,5,B00FV9CWN8,"It arrived on time and in great condition.

As for the movie, it's amazing. True, it's not horror, but a different type of horror. The torture/kill scenes are pretty awesome and if you're able to watch the whole thing, then you'll be able to see the great ending :)",1452902400,4,265,4.408163265306122

 Looks like it was filmed on a vhs recorder.",1439078400,3,125,4.208333333333333
