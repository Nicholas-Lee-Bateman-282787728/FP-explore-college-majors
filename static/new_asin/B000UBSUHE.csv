8212831,5,B000UBSUHE,"I really love this collection! The movies are Tobacco Road (1941) Thunder Birds (1942) Laura (1944) Leave Her To Heaven (1945) The Ghost Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947). Each movie comes in it's own dvd case. Only problem is they are not region 1 which means they won't play in most American DVD players, but they play great in my laptop!",1492905600,3,333,4.475409836065574
