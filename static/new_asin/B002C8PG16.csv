8363600,2,B002C8PG16,"I picked this up on Black Friday morning for my husband, as we love these documentary films.  What you need to realize is that most of the footage is 20-30 years old.  It's always interesting, but I expected something closer to Planet Earth, which we also have and love.

If you're looking for modern-day footage AND information, spend the extra money and get Planet Earth.",1262304000,8,373,4.707692307692308
