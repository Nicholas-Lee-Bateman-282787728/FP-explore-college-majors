581225,5,630315851X,Cinderfella is a wonderful spin on the classic tale of the poor step-child and wicked step-family.  The story is witty and Jerry Lewis is absolutely hilarious.  The presence of the Count Basie Orchestra is icing on the cake!!,970963200,7,225,4.894736842105263

The moral to the story, you can find your ""Princess"" Charming! Now if we can just convince Jerry Lewis to release the one film he filmed but never released... ""The Day The Clown Cried"". There you go Amazon... that would be a good exclusive for you. Work with Jerry to obtain rights for it, and help provide any edits that Jerry needs to correct the bits he is not proud of and feels needs reshot. Heck, he can reshoot scenes using CGI to put his face on another actor like Jim Cary, using Jerry's voice, or simply take a page from the recent reshoots of the missing Dr. Who episodes shot in Flash animation.... reshoot scenes using Jerry's voice overs to animation.

581869,5,630315851X,"I remember seeing this movie a while ago when I was younger. Even then, I thought this movie was pretty amazing. It's not revered as one of Jerry Lewis best movies to some, but to me it holds a place as one of all all time favorite movies. The movie follows Fella, a ""then"" modern day version of Cinderella, who lives with his evil stepmother and two spoiled brat brothers that treat him like he's a nobody. Later he get's a visit from his ""Fairy God-Father"" who in fact claims to be the one who was behind the transformation of Cinderella but not acknowledged as such. He pretty much uplifts Fella and prepares him for his time at the ball to woo Princess Charming respectively, whom his evil step mother and brothers have been trying to prevent him from encountering.

Later, Fella, shows up and makes a heck of an entrance to the sounds of Count Basie and his World Renowned Orchestra and has his dance with Princess Charming which was pretty amazing as well. And later goes through the motions of the clock hitting 12am and reverting to himself, ordinary. Later the Princess Charming encounters him and they both go though the motions and later end up together. This movie is one the whole family can enjoy, and hopeless romantics would I sure like this movie as well. It's simple and clean, you get a little of the kookiness that is Jerry Lewis, as well as a more serious side of this that isn't often seen in his movies. It's a great movie and a great buy if you're curious about it, or a collector of Jerry Lewis movies. The cast worked really well together and the best way in my opinion to see if it's a movie for you is to check it out.",1379980800,3,1646,4.379084967320262

The majority of the movie was just a wreck--like a bunch of rehearsal scenes thrown together on a bad day of rehearsing!  Jerry Lewis' acting was very inconsistent--in the beginning Fella seems to be a crossed-eyed half-wit and then halfway thru seems like a normal guy.  there was no cohesion to the plot at all.  In the beginning the stepmother is a gold-digger who just wants to find out where Fella's inheritance is hidden.  By the end, she inexplicably feels bad and doesn't want any of the money--what just happened??

I enjoyed the last 20 minutes of Cinderfella (out of 87 minutes total).  When the Fairy Godfather returned during the ball to help Fella, then the movie decided it wanted to be a romantic musical and it was great from there. (Way too late, needless to say)

582119,3,630315851X,"I just watched this movie this morning. As Jerry Lewis movies go, this one is strangely quieter than most of his other movies. Although the movie is a generally pleasant diversion, it isn't as funny as his best movies. He plays a totally passive, doormat that his family members continuously insult and order around, and he strangely never seems to object to this abuse or stand up for himself, for whatever reason. I suppose that he's just too timid and selfless to have any dignity at all, which is not a particularly funny state of affairs.
Ed Wynn is always good in any movie that he's in, but he too can barely raise his voice or get too excited during the movie. He is pretty elderly at this point in his career, so the general lack of vitality is understandable.
Cinderfella surprises the wealthy crowd at the ball, where the princess is, and he immediately starts tearing himself down and telling the princess that he really doesn't belong there. The next thing you know, the princess falls in love with him, for no apparrent reason. No yucks there, but of course it has a happy ending with the princess settling on Cinderfella over the many wealthy, charming, and sophisticated men at the ball. Makes a lot of sense, right?

582122,3,630315851X,"Made primarily as a Christmas attraction for family audiences, CINDERFELLA (1960) stars Jerry Lewis in a gender-bending spin on everyone's favourite fairytale, co-starring Judith Anderson and Ed Wynn.

Fella (Jerry Lewis) lives with his overbearing stepmother (Judith Anderson) and two stepbrothers (Henry Silva and Robert Hutton) in his dead father's Beverly Hills mansion, where he's treated like a servant--and a klutzy one at that!  Forbidden to attend a party being held in honour of the visiting Princess Charming (Anna Maria Alberghetti), Fella's eccentric Fairy Godfather (Ed Wynn) steps in to lend a helping hand...

Unless you're a Jerry Lewis fan (and there really is no 'gray area'), you won't entirely appreciate his performance in CINDERFELLA.  Lewis was given lots of free rein with his performance in this movie, and the constant mugging sometimes causes the feather-light story to become bogged down.  Anna Maria Alberghetti provides a sweet Princess but her role is fairly minor.  Judith Anderson (""Rebecca"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"") does manage to turn the stepmother into an ultimately sympathetic character, something you don't really get in any other 'Cinderella' movie.

The DVD includes some fun outtakes and bloopers, plus a commentary track with Jerry Lewis and his friend, singer Steve Lawrence.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).",1213747200,6,1356,5.485576923076923
582123,1,630315851X,"Cinderfella is painful to watch. This film is a complete, unabashed challenge to enjoy, and it's basically impossible for me. Every time I give it a new chance, it fails miserably to entertain. I usually enjoy Jerry Lewis. I love ""The Ladies Man"", ""The Bellboy""... and even ""The Nutty Professor"" (which slowly sinks into a very somber, depressing mood). But ""Cinderfella"" just makes me scratch my head, wondering what the appeal is. It boggles the mind how people can love this awful film.

I don't care at all about the character of Fella, who isn't even likeable to begin with, so there is no investment, no concern as to what happens to him. Will he somehow go to the ball? I couldn't care less. He's just a dolt.

The few good things it offers:
It's nice to look at. Lush sets, Edith Head's costumes, and fun colors.
The dance sequence with Fella and the princess is nice.
Sadly, none of these things saves the film from being a fiasco.

And the comedy sequences fall incredibly flat. The dining room table bit is awful and endless. I never laugh at this film. It's not a comedy. I don't know what it is, really.

I cannot overemphasize the fact that Cinderfella is entirely too slow in its pace. And I am not alone in this opinion, not by a long shot.

And it gets too maudlin in spots (especially during the few dull, ridiculous songs featured). This film is like those single soppy scenes in his other films where Jerry indulges his soft, sad side. It comes off mawkish and inappropriate. Like in ""The Disorderly Orderly"", when the bitter blonde girl brings the entire movie's light mood crashing to a disturbing halt; a comedy movie that contains a nasty, overly sour psycho? It's just unnecessary.

I am being completely honest here with my review because I know someone new to this movie will have high hopes based on the reviews that praise it, and may end up very disappointed as I was.

Bottom line: Boring and not worth one's time.",1200528000,5,1945,4.57183908045977

582126,2,630315851X,"In the 1970s, Jerry Lewis movies were sporadically shown at 8 p.m. on New York station WNEW. At the time, I enjoyed these prime time showings, like this movie, ""That's My Boy,"" and ""Don't Give Up the Ship."" How times have changed. Watching some of these movies today is downright painful. (Actually, all of them probably are; I just haven't seen them all recently.)

Cinderfella in particular struck me as a complete Jerry Lewis vanity project, probably no less than ""The Nutty Professor."" Both had Lewis combining his trademark childish antics with ""serious"" scenes of him supposedly being a devastatingly suave and irresistible ladies' man. Cinderfella had the additional detriment of regularly regaling us with Lewis' grating and self-indulgent renditions of maudlin songs not worthy of even a Disney cartoon. In later years, his singing would become the low point in all of his Muscular Dystrophy telethons.

Part of the problem was that Lewis didn't age well. When he was young and lanky, he could pull off the man-child role. But by the time of this movie, at the tender age of 34, he was already starting to puff up. He should have been evolving his comedic style, as Jim Carrey and Tom Hanks did as they aged. The same, old schtick becomes tiresome very quickly. It didn't help that he insisted on wearing two big, ""macho"" rings on his hands, which the supposedly unassuming and impoverished Fella never would have worn. Jerry, you're overcompensating. And, sorry, but you're no Dean Martin, who COULD pull off the easy charisma of a natural charmer and had a great voice (and didn't need and didn't wear as much finger bling).

Finally, the ending of the movie didn't work, either. Are we supposed to cheer that the princess ended up with Fella? After all, wasn't it drilled into our brains all through the movie that Fella is a clumsy and complete imbecile, mitigated only by the fact that he's well-meaning and kind? Quite frankly, I'm not sure I would wish him and his constant bumbling on any woman.",1156464000,6,2012,4.826086956521739
582127,2,630315851X,"While many people have written off Jerry Lewis as a vulgar and unfunny celebrity whose fame seems unwarranted, I believe that the man has comedic talent - and occasional brilliance - but that he needs to be reined in with strong directors and scripts. When set free and loose, Lewis can be as manically annoying as Robin Williams and seem like nothing more than an adult with attention deficit disorder in serious need of medicine. When reined in and forced to tone down the volume on his antics and perosonality (someone needed to tell Lewis that simply making a lot of geeky facial grimaces and spastic movements does not constitute comedy), he is capable of developing his ideas into good comedy that elevates him from being yesterday's Adam Sandler to Laurel and Hardy quality status. Lewis also needed to be told that a Chaplin or a Keaton he would never be (Lewis was far too vulgar and not intelligent enough) but that there was nothing wrong with developing his own character of the schmo.
This film lacked a good script. The appropriation of the Cinderella story is weak and was only sturdy enough to support a tv sketch - not a movie. The direction is merely competent - but there are signs that Tashlin wouldn't or couldn't control Lewis (many scenes go on forever and editing was needed). Lewis has a few good moments miming to a Count Basie piece that show how good his timing could be. Mostly though, this is a bad movie.
And that is what can be frustrating about Lewis: the talent is there; it just is allowed to lie dormant through far too many bad, bad movies. If you took the good stuff out of all of the movies he made after ""The Nutty Professor"" and combined them, you wouldn't have enough to fill up two movies.",1154217600,7,1732,4.55448717948718

582190,4,630315851X,"""Cinderfella"" was Jerry Lewis' answer to the classic Cinderella story. And he intended it to be a masterpiece. To say that it fell somewhat short of it's goal is putting it mildly, but it's not bad. The plot is, of course the familiar story, with a few (expected) variations. When his father dies, poor Fella (Lewis) is left at the mercy of his snobbish stepmother (Judith Anderson) and her two no-good sons, Maximilian (Henry Silva) and Rupert (Robert Hutton). As he slaves away for his nasty step-family, Maximilian and Rupert attempt to find a treasure Fella's father has supposedly hidden on the estate. Meanwhile, hoping to restore her dwindling fortunes, the stepmother plans a fancy ball in honor of the visiting Princess Charmein (Anna Maria Alberghetti) whom she hopes will marry Rupert. Eventually, Fella's Fairy Godfather (Ed Wynn) shows up to convince him that he has a shot at winning the Princess himself. Lewis had big plans for the film's release. Although it was completed in January of 1960, he insisted it make it's debut that Christmas, complete with a holiday campaign and record album tie-in. In the meantime, he produced and starred in a low budget item called ""The Bellboy"" in order for Paramount to have a Jerry Lewis movie for summer release. ""Cinderfella"" was given a lavish production and a formidable supporting cast was recruited to co star with Lewis. He was indeed fortunate to obtain the services of Judith Anderson, who, while not a performer one would expect in a Jerry Lewis film, was nevertheless excellent as the stepmother, bringing just the right touch of arrogance to the part. Ed Wynn is reliably daffy as the Fairy Godfather,though, due to severe editing, he disappears before the climax, and is not seen again. Silva and Hutton do what they can as the stepbrothers, but the beautiful Alberghetti has nothing to do but fall hopelessly in love with the hapless Fella. The pace of the film is somewhat choppy, and several critics pointed out that the editing had left voids in the plot. The film originally ran 99 minutes, it ended up at 88. Sure enough, it was released at Christmastime, when it inspired some of the most scathing critical comment ever bestowed on a Lewis picture. Most of this was devoted to Lewis' own performance, and his frequent mugging, mixed with his pathetic attempts to play for sympathy. ""Cinderfella"" did just O.K. at the box office, and it ended up well behind the modest ""Bellboy"" which was a box-office smash. Thanks to handsome sets (with exteriors filmed at the ""Beverly Hillbillies"" estate in Bel Air, CA), costumes and a pleasant (if unmemorable) score, ""Cinderfella"" is entertaining enough to get by. But you'd better be prepared for a lot of ""singing/mugging"" from the Producer/Star, who fancied himself a brilliant vocalist. After all, though, this is SUPPOSED to be a fairy tale!

582193,3,630315851X,"Jerry Lewis was busy in 1960, capitalizing on his popularity with ""Visit to a Small Planet,"" ""The Bell Boy,"" and this movie, as well as singing the title song for the movie ""Raymie.""  While ""Cinderfella"" is less than many of Jerry Lewis's best movies, it is family friendly and enjoyable kooky fare.

Jerry Lewis is Fella.  His father has passed away and left the house to his stepmother, played by Judith Anderson.  Of course, Fella has two rather vain and greedy stepbrothers, Maximilian (Henry Silva) and Rupert (Robert Hutton).  As with the original story of Cinderella, everyone treats Fella poorly.  Since the stepmother is running out of money, and since they believe Fella might know where his father hid millions, they decide to be nice to Fella.  There is a lengthy scene at an excessively long table that soon becomes annoying.  Fella keeps changing coats as he alternately tries to eat and tries to serve his stepmother and stepbrothers.  However, when Fella tries to light Maximilian's cigarette, the attempts are one of the gems of this movie.

One day everyone hears that Princess Charming, played by beautiful Anna Marie Alberghetti, is coming to visit with the purpose of finding a husband.  We know that Fella's fairy godmother is going to show up.  Oops, make that fairy godfather, in the form of Ed Wynn.  Ed goes through a story about how the point of having Fella marry the princess is to counter the story of Cinderella.  Actually, that part of the movie is tedious and unnecessary.  During Ed's attempt to convince Fella that he is a real fairy godfather he makes Cinderella (Nola Thorp) appear.

There is the necessary scene at the ball where Fella appears in an outfit that looks a bit like a movie usher's uniform (the pants have a stripe down the side).  Of course, there is fun and frivolity until the stroke of midnight, when all of Fella's accouterments must necessarily undo themselves.  As soon as Fella gets the chauffeur back into the water, since the chauffeur was a goldfish, Maximilian shows up and threatens Fella, wanting him to reveal where the money is.  The viewer needs to see how that scene ends.

As must happen in any movie related to Cinderella, everything must come out in the end of this short movie, which is less than an hour and a half long, but I will leave the details for you to discover.

This movie bears a lot of similarity to the superior ""The Nutty Professor"" from 1963.  As in the latter movie, Lewis plays two characters.  In the latter movie, one character is very wacky, and the other is very suave and cool.  In ""Cinderfella,"" one character is a bit kooky, but the other character is almost a caricature of being suave.  Thus, the two characters in ""The Nutty Professor"" are extremes rather than the milder characters in ""Cinderfella.""  However, ""The Nutty Professor"" is funnier too.  I like this movie and ""The Nutty Professor,"" but I think the latter is more sophisticated and better developed, as well as being funnier.

Count Basie and his orchestra appear in this movie, and as usual the big band sound is excellent.  Of course, you have to have an appreciation for this kind of music.

There was a reference in a Lewis song to his membership in the Mickey Mouse Club, which I believe had recently gone off the air in 1960, though I think reruns were playing.

The DVD release had bloopers and a commentary by Jerry Lewis and Steve Lawrence.

The story of course, is basically a twist on the traditional Cinderella story.  Jerry Lewis plays Fella, the mistreated Stepson who can't go to the princess' ball, until his fairy godfather transforms him into a toned down version of Buddy Love (from the Nutty Professor).

Jerry Lewis is a bit more subdued in this film, but we still get some classic schtick that fits in without going overboard.

One of the great moments is seeing Fella swing with the Count Basie Orchestra.",1091059200,10,556,4.821052631578947
582197,5,630315851X,"I recall watching some Jerry Lewis movies when I was a child while visiting my Aunts house. I was entertained. As I grew older I found that Jerry Lewis became lost in childhood memories. However, one late night I was watching television and this movie was on. I had missed the beginning, and had to go to bed before the end, if I hadn't I would have been up to 5:30. I thought this movie was sooo cute, that I just had to order it. And it was worth it. I love the Cinderella gone upside down plot of this movie, and Jerry is an adorable jem. Perhaps I was a fan all along, but this movie had to remind me of it. This movie inspires me to see more of what Jerry has to offer and perhaps view some more of his movies as a grown up! A child grownup that is, who always roots for the underdog!",1078444800,23,789,3.9685534591194966
