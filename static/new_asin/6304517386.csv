7873650,1,6304517386,"With the beautiful cover shot and Rand McNally name on the package, I thought I would be viewing fabulous, high-quality footage of our National Parks. Instead, I got ""A Doug Jones Travelog Production"" from the 1970's. The poor quality footage is dated and tired-looking, the colors are dull and the details are hard to see. While somewhat informative, it fell short of depicting the true magnificence and grandeur of America's natural scenic wonders. I was completely disappointed.",974592000,2,481,5.259740259740259
7873651,1,6304517386,"Very poor quality film, considering the amount of visitors to the Natinal parks every year, surely they could afford an new film (IMAX), the picture is very blocky and the coverage of each park is very limited, if youve  never visited the parks contained on this 80min DVD before its worth a  look, otherwise buy a nice book.",940377600,3,325,4.586206896551724
