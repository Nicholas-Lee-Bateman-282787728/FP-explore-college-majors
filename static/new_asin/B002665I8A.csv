8352122,3,B002665I8A,"Even though this movie may not have the flash and flare of some movies, the content and the point of the movie was good. It brought to the forefront something that many filmmakers have made jokes about but it is a reality. Some may not think that there are church members who actually fantasize about their spiritual leaders. Even though it may not be intentional for some, church members have to remember that their pastor is their pastor, the leader of the church. There have been several different kinds of movies out portraying Pastors and Reverends as skirt chasers but this shows a man of GOD that is upright. I enjoyed it.",1328227200,,629,4.625
8352123,1,B002665I8A,The quality of this movie was so bad I could barely make it through the first 5 minutes. But I suffered through the entire thing hoping that I could at least connect with the story but that didn't happen either.,1264204800,,211,4.3
