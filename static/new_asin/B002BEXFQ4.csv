8361088,1,B002BEXFQ4,Sound and film both have terrible quality on every DVD.  Would not recommend at any price.,1473552000,,90,4.625
8361089,3,B002BEXFQ4,"PROS: I enjoy these very old westerns.  They are just relaxing and fun and easy to watch.  At a dollar and eighty cents each, one can't beat the deal.  Tim McCoy often seems an old sort to be cast as an action hero, but somehow he pulls it off.
CONS:  One expects fairly low video quality of these films, as video restoration is time consuming and expensive.  However, even at this low price, it would have been relatively inexpensive to filter some of the background noise and hum from these DVDs.  That's my only complaint, but the audio quality is poor enough to drop the rating to three stars.",1455494400,3,597,4.431192660550459
