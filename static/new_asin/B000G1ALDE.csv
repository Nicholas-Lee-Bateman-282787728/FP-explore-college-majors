2597350,5,B000G1ALDE,"By chance I caught this movie on CableTV before I cancelled the cable due to the vapid nature of most of the viewing!!  Then I went about searching for a copy (this was before I discovered all the video's available on Amazon). Obviously I now own a copy.

Extremely Ozian humor of course. A slice of life... lotteries and gambling, wanting to live la vida loca... a group of working class buddies and their 'life plans'... an eclectic group of wives. A junk yard and and and... a ""discovery"" way out in nowhere.  I would say a perfect script - the casting is flawless.  Very very funny - visually and the dialog. One of those 'watch it occasionally to sort out your perspective' kind of movies.  Definitely should have won awards. Much appreciation to the actors and those that made the movie.",1297123200,2,793,4.556338028169014
2597351,5,B000G1ALDE,This is a hilarious movie.  Hmmm I'd like to marry Lotto.  It would be nice if I could win that one.,1274313600,,100,3.7142857142857144
2597352,4,B000G1ALDE,This movie reminded me of the stupid funny of the 80's movies - a mindless good time.,1259971200,,85,4.0588235294117645
2597353,5,B000G1ALDE,"Being a big Eric Bana fan...sigh...so highly underrated, it was nice to find another nugget of his to add to my collection!  Not only is he smoking hot, I've not seen many of his comedies so it was nice to see this comedic side of his...a true must for fans of Eric!!",1247443200,3,267,4.134615384615385
2597354,5,B000G1ALDE,"The Nugget is an example of fine Australian wit, charm, and comedy.  The movie stars Eric Bana, amongst many other outstanding Australian actors, who keeps you on your toes and laughing throughout the entire film.  I enjoyed this movie very much.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Eric Bana or just looking for a good laugh - Aussie style.",1246665600,,361,4.523076923076923
2597355,5,B000G1ALDE,"If you can follow clever, classic Aussie humor, this is a very funny movie.

I wish MORE Australian movies were available in N.American DVD format! I would buy all of them!",1225324800,,172,4.548387096774194
2597356,4,B000G1ALDE,"This is just a feel good happy comedy with a happy ending. Its one of those movies you watch just to be entertained and not have to put too much thought into. I bought it for the cast mainly, it features some of Australia's best comics such as Eric Bana, Dave O'Neil and Peter Moon and a couple of our best actors in Stephen Curry and Vince Colosimo. Also stars the very likeable Belinda Emmett (RIP - she will be missed) who sadly gave up acting when she got cancer. This probably won't appeal to international audiences as the jokes are very Australian. But if you are interested in seeing Eric Bana in a more comedic role, this would have to be his funniest role to date.",1160524800,3,674,4.31496062992126
8128238,5,B000G1ALDE,"This isn't an Academy Award winning movie or anything, but it still is a lot of fun.  Basically three slackers who work for their local council road maintenance crew (work being a bit of an exaggeration) spend a lot of their weekends camping on their goldmine claim bit of land, much to their hot wives annoyance.  When one goes to empty his bladder he unwittingly discovers a massive gold nugget.  These three mates now think they're rich so chuck the nugget in the back of their ute and drive to a local takeaway shop where they can't stop laughing when they realise they can't pay for the food.  They of course didn't do the smart thing of taking the nugget and cashing it in straight away.  Others know about the nugget.  Greed will of course raise its ugly head.  Will any of these three end up rich?

This is a movie that celebrates the aussie bogan and aussie ""battler"" stereotypes without being completely over the top as is often done when trying to portray this part of Australian culture.  The wives of these three did seem very out of their league, but other than that it was a somewhat plausible tale. If you just want a fun tale, you won't go wrong with The Nugget.

Obviously the wife of Eric Bana's character Lotto, Cherly, was played by Belinda Emmett who was diagnosed with cancer during shooting this one and passed away in 2006.  I mention this as the region 4 DVD has a nice interview by her then boyfriend (possibly husband) Rove McManus on Rove Live where she is recovering from treatment and alongside Stephen Curry (Wookie in this film) jokes around while promoting this film and Mudgee the town it was filmed in.  Other extras include an alternative ending, deleted scenes, bloopers, interviews with all the main actors and the director amongst other stuff.  If you've got a multi-zone player it's worth getting the region 4 DVD for these extras.",1475971200,,1872,4.619335347432024
8128239,5,B000G1ALDE,"This move is a must see Aussie style movie for the detectorist and prospector, It's witty, funny and an every day experience. Gets you in a outdoor cautious mood to find gold and how gold effects others around you. Truth to the end LOL!!!! I have with 27 years of experience in prospecting and still going, a must have in your collection of videos !!!!!",1466640000,,353,4.446153846153846

8128244,4,B000G1ALDE,"This is an Aussie comedy from 2002 starring Eric Bana who was known for his comedic turns at this time and before he went on to much deserved Hollywood fame. Here he is one of three mates who all work on the road crews. He plays the unluckiest man in the world `Lotto' so called becasue he will never win it. He works with `Wookie' played by the always brilliant Stephen Curry ('The Castle' and `Rogue') and Sue.

They go prospecting at weekends and spend most of their time having a few `tinnies', then thanks to a parakeet and the `hand of God' they discover a 24 carat lump of gold. This is the nugget of the title and then the fun begins. They are spending the money before they even have it and worse still the news is hard to keep quiet in a small town and soon everyone wants a piece of the action and the girlfriends are at it too.

This is a nice comedy and not a `bust a gut' effort but it is amusing and deals with a whole host of issues including greed, dishonesty, and how much we value our friends. I really enjoyed it but this is not the best antipodean comedy out there, but is still a great way to while away an hour and a half with a few tinnies of your own.",1398038400,,1176,4.064655172413793
8128245,5,B000G1ALDE,"This movie is great! My husband and I have re-watched this movie so many times, because it always makes up laugh. I even had to buy an extra copy to share with my friends. This is one of Eric Bana's earlier movies and he great at comedy. All the other characters are great too. This is a movie we never get tired of it, as if it's a cult classic. Nugget is loaded with catch-phrases that my husband and I use together all the time. I really recommend this movie.",1360195200,,462,4.144444444444445

8128247,4,B000G1ALDE,"Living in California now, I love collecting my aussie films and showing them to locals, but i refuse to buy anything that is NOT widescreen in this day and age. Most dissapointed as I actually have not seen this yet *(
Dont forget to checkout Two Hands, and The Castle for more great touches of aussie flavoured life.",1314576000,,317,4.482758620689655
