8376370,5,B002OQZEEA,One of the best documentaries of all time.,1501459200,,42,4.375
8376371,4,B002OQZEEA,"Wesley Willis is a true outsider artist.  Schizophrenic, hugely overweight, fighting physical ailments, often unwashed, but possessed of enormous talents as a visual artist, and fun, enjoyable ones as a sort of punk musician and songwriter.

But more than that, as tormented as he sometimes is, this is also a man with a huge heart, given to sharing friendly head-butts with anyone he takes a liking too -- which seems to cover a huge part of the human race.  And in turn he inspires remarkable loyalty from those who love him - friends who take him in, try to keep him fed, washed, happy.  Musicians who want to tour and play with him, or put his music on records, Art collectors who buy his striking line drawings of the streets and skylines of his native, beloved Chicago.

But I appreciate that the film doesnt cover up or ignore Wesleys darker sides  the internal demons that manifest and speak to him, his flashes of anger, his inability to take care of himself.  This isn't a romanticized vision of being mentally unblanaced and out on the street, even if it is often a heart-filled one.

It's very frustrating that this terrific documentary is long out-of-print and basically unavailable on DVD, with copies going for hundreds of dollars.  It seems like someone should pick up the rights for this - just as with Wesley's music and art, I'm sure it would find an audience.",1458950400,,1379,4.6887966804979255
8376372,4,B002OQZEEA,"A fairly detailed look at Wesley, inside and out: The Daddy of Rock and Roll was its predecessor, and to this film's credit, it gave a slightly more balanced perspective at who he was and where he came from; for instance, holding him accountable for some of his behavior, regardless of the fact that he was cursed with a horrible upbringing and a progressive mental illness. A lot of comparisons to Daddy of Rock and Roll, however: similar arc, a lot of duplicate footage. Still a ""pro"" Wesley film, as I would expect any documentary based on Wes to be, but it does leave you asking the question, was another doc really necessary in addition to Daddy of Rock and Roll? If I had to answer, it would be no, but being the Wesley fan I am, I enjoyed the film regardless of its similarities",1453766400,,785,4.4206896551724135

8376374,5,B002OQZEEA,"Really captures Wesley in his day to day adventures. After watching this ,I realize that despite the schizophrenia, Wesley was able to be happy. His songs and amazing artwork will let him live on forever.",1399075200,,204,4.857142857142857
8376375,2,B002OQZEEA,"Not a good documentary, the other one is much better. I got bored with this one and shut it off.",1385942400,,96,3.85
8376376,5,B002OQZEEA,"This was an excellent documentary. It's funny, touching, creatively assembled, and informative. I've seen two screenings of it, and I noticed it appealed to a pretty wide spectrum of people. Even if you're not a huge Wesley Willis fan, or even not a huge fan of rockumentaries, this movie will likely still be very engaging.",1266451200,,324,4.909090909090909
8376377,5,B002OQZEEA,"Wesley was a close friend of mine.  I first met him in 1996, while he was on tour with The Wesley Willis Fiasco.  We stayed in touch, and over the years, we became quite close.  I was always fascinated by Wesley.  His music, art and personality were completely uncompromising.  I admired his tireless quest to continue producing music and drawings, and I always thought that his life story would make an amazing film.\

This is not the first documentary that has been made about the life of Wesley Willis, but it is by far the best.  I was fortunate enough to catch a screening at the SxSW Film Festival last year.  I was struck by how well edited the film was, how much homework the filmmakers had done, (like tracking down Wesley's siblings, father, and high school art teacher), and how respectful the filmmakers were of their subject.  It would be easy to tell Wesley's story in the wrong way, (see ""The Daddy of Rock & Roll"").  It was a relief, and a pleasure to see that these two created something that is long overdue, and will certainly be treasured by many for years to come... A thorough and thought provoking exploration of the life and work of one of the most unique talents of our time.  I strongly recommend this movie to anyone.  Even if you've never heard of Wesley Willis, you will surely find this film fascinating.  I can't wait to own this on DVD.",1259107200,7,1368,4.489878542510121
8376378,5,B002OQZEEA,"I was lucky and got to see a screening of this at the Starz Film Center in Denver, Colorado. It is the best Wesley Willis documentary available. The filmmakers go into detail concerning Mr. Willis' early life, his early art career selling drawings of the Chicago cityscape on the street and how a schizophrenic and borderline homeless man became a musical legend. In the film there are interviews with family, friends, roommates and those who encouraged his art. Lovingly constructed by directors Chris Bagley and Kim Shively of clips from the last five years of his life before he passed away from leukemia at age 40.",1259107200,2,618,4.839622641509434
