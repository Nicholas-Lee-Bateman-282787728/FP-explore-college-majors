I got a little less than half way through, then, I just couldn't take it anymore. It was just too irritating.",1505952000,,265,4.428571428571429

8165850,1,B000M2DKBW,"Some thieves accidentally release a toxin in a school which contaminates the water supply. This turns a bunch of students into blood thirsty ghouls. Unlike Zombies they can move quickly. The movie was designed to be cheesy and campy, but was simply stupid. The funniest scene was when the kids were chased into the auditorium by the ghouls. The doors swung out, but the kids were able to prevent the ghouls from entering by standing/blocking the inside of the door. The budget was too low to rehang a door.

The gore was typically scenes of blood and guts being ripped from a body, although you don't see a face on the body being ripped apart. They used fake body parts but couldn't figure out how to bury/cover a person so just their head shows, making it look like their body is being ripped. The extras were just as bad. The appearances of Joe Franklin and Jackie Martling added nothing to the movie.

F-bomb. No sex. No nudity.",1309737600,2,931,4.568862275449102
8165851,3,B000M2DKBW,"Timothy O'Rawe comes from the same school of film making as Lloyd Kaufman and the rest of the Troma Team, where less is never more. Every aspect of this no-budget zombie picture is exaggerated to a ridiculous extreme, with comically over-the-top characters, a goofy B-movie plot, and outrageous moments of gore. GHOUL SCHOOL enrolls a pair of would-be thieves who accidentally release a deadly poison into the campus water supply, turning the entire student body into a pack of ravenous fiends! There is no mistaking the film's many flaws, but fans of THE TOXIC AVENGER will find plenty to enjoy in its silly performances and intentionally terrible humor. With costumes and FX that were clearly influenced by Lamberto Bava's DEMONS, THE EVIL DEAD, and others, GHOUL SCHOOL manages to sneak in some impressive splatter for the budget. As Timothy O'Rawe's first and only film, it serves as a cheesy reminder of everything Horror fans loved from the 80s.
