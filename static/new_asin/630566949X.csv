7896038,5,630566949X,"Here is a fantastic concert from the Cocoanut Grove back in the years. The material is varied, and some of it makes it worth buying the DVD, especially the tracks where Ritenour plays the acoustic guitar, but also the tracks with Steve Lukather. The tracks with Phil Perry are also outstanding performances, as the singing is absolutely fantastic. Anthony Jackson playing the bass guitar is another super high. When looking at his own reactions, you can see that he is also very satisfied with his playing! He does things on the bass that you normally would not think you can do on the bass, and he supports the soloists perfectly and with great feeling. Harvey Mason plays great, but the drums sound dated, with the drum sounds popular at that time. Joao Bosco's Brazilian stuff swings your socks off. And there is more , with Bob James, Tuck and Patti, and others. Okay, this is simply a must!",1423094400,,895,4.670886075949367
7896039,4,630566949X,I waited a  long time for this DVD and I just love watching  and listening to it.  They don't  make music like this anymore,1415404800,,123,4.0

7896041,5,630566949X,"I've been a fan of 'Rit' for almost thirty years and have had the pleasure of seeing him play just the once, in a rather strange place in London called the 'Jazz Cafe'.  He has in the past been criticised for playing in different genres but for me that is his virtuosity.  Taste and preference aside, I doubt anyone, with credibility, could question his technical dexterity, his mastery of the guitar and his understanding of music.  And a brief handshake after his London performance suggests he's a nice man to boot!  The performance captured on this DVD is a showcase for Rit's talents playing a variety of guitars from a big, fat Gibson to a fairly rare outing with a solid electric (a rather nice, battle weary Fender Strat).  As a solo artist of this calibre, I suspect it's relatively easy to enlist the assistance of the likes of Harvey Mason Jr on drums and Anthony Jackson on bass.  Added treats like the slightly reclusive Paulinho da Costa on percussion and Steve Lukather for a highly charged guitar duet make this a beautifully balanced performance.  To watch someone like this (or Antonio Forcione, Jeff Beck, Acoustic Alchemy, Larry Carlton et al) makes me undecided as to whether I should take some serious lessons or pass on my guitar to someone more deserving.  Oh... just buy the DVD!",1261353600,,1304,4.713656387665198
7896042,5,630566949X,"Trust me, this CD is NOT in Japanese. Both Joao Bosco and Phil Perry sing BRAZILIAN  songs sung in the native tongue of Brazil. And I don't remember Lee singing at all, not even backup.
Not mentioned is two tunes featuing Rit and Steve Lukather (of Toto). They both light up ""Cause We've Ended as Lovers"" and finish with a BRAZILIAN song sung by Phil Perry.
Some cool tunes with Tuck and Patti and a couple of tunes from ""Stolen Moments.""",1027036800,10,438,4.407407407407407
7896043,3,630566949X,"Outstanding- Lee Ritenour has come a long way he always shows great musicianship. I've been a fan of this guy for years,if you look at this line up then you'lle agree that this was actually the start of ""Fourplay"" Bob James,Harvey Mason and Lee Ritenour only one guy joined later and that is Nathan East. But these cats are always together and they are some of the best muzos around the world. Buy this DVD because there are so many extras in the line up Paulino da Costa,Joao Bosco and Anthony Jackson. As music lovers we have to understand that you can not buy a 80's recording and expect it to sound like it was recorded today enjoy the music.",998784000,6,646,4.391666666666667
7896044,1,630566949X,"This DVD is terrible!  It's in Japanese.... the tunes are cool, but I did not know that Lee spoke Japanese.  It's not Japenese overdub, he's actually singing in Japenese.  It was just TOO wierd to watch.  So, unless you like cool Jazz sung in Japensese, don't get this one",990403200,,272,4.489795918367347
7896045,4,630566949X,"This DVD of Rit's is both a potpouree of who's who in his many earlier cd's, and a real treat for those who have not seen them together live. He has the usual group of ""technicians"" in the sets, but he adds  Joao Bosco and Paulinho da Costa, from the ""FESTIVAL"" CD  sessions, and makes it all come alive. That set alone makes this a MUST to  ""Captain Fingers"" fans. It is, a must amoung the sadly small  choices of great jazz music dvd's. You'll love it, and it's 2 for 1 ! WOW!",958435200,17,478,4.053191489361702
