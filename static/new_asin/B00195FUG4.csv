8271994,5,B00195FUG4,"This is an amazing production.  It is one that I watch over and over for the totality of its effect.  The huge set easily handles the movements of a large chorus of soldiers, townspeople and principles.  The grandeur of the set implies the grandeur of a China of old.  The huge pyramidal stairway that forms the center of the action allows a visual depiction of the changing power relationship between Calif and Turandot.  The video image is a bit soft and washed out, but clear.  The sound is amazing considering the age of the performance and the outdoor location.  The English subtitles are fine and not intrusive.  My wife cried with the death of Liu.  Graziano Polidori, Pier Francesco Poli and Antonio Bevacqua are particularly effective as Ping, Pang, and Pong.",1474329600,,768,4.801526717557252

8271996,5,B00195FUG4,"This is one of three excellent versions of Turandot on DVD.  The other two are the Metropolitan Opera's opulent Franco Zeffirelli production with Eva Marton, Leona Mitchell, Placido Domingo, and Paul Plishka under James Levine, and the 1958 RAI black-and-white film version (an intriguing and effective melding of kabuki theater with Italian commedia dell' arte) with Lucille Udovich, Renata Mattioli, Franco Corelli, and Plinio Clabassi under Fernando Previtali.

This production from the outdoor Arena di Verona production, by Brian Large, with Ghena Dimitrova, Cecilia Gasdia, Nicola Martinucci, and Ivo Vinco under Daniel Oren, has the disadvantage compared to the other two versions of the difficulty of recording singers and an orchestra in a spacious outdoor venue that quickly disperses the sound. In addition, conductor Oren is the weak link in the performance; he isn't bad, but sometimes his handling of the score is slack compared to Levine and Previtali, both far more able maestros.

Where this production scores major points is in its singers.  Ghena Dimitrova is the Turandot for the ages, with a voice as titanic as her physique is zaftig.  The cruelly high tessitura doesn't even begin to faze her, and her minimal acting skills actually serve well to characterize the icy princess who melts in fear and then love.  Vocally she has no equals -- not Maria Callas, not Birgit Nilsson, not Inge Borkh (a personal favorite), and certainly not the idiosyncratically miscast Joan Sutherland under Zubin Mehta.  By contrast, Eva Marton, though effective, is already showing signs of the vocal wear and tear that presaged her imminent vocal decline, while Lucille Udovich is quite solid but just not in the same league. Nicola Martinucci brings his decidedly baritonal voice effectively, if unsubtly, to bear as a manly Calaf, whereas Domingo is not in his best form for Levine and shows moments of strain, though he is still of course a major asset. Of course, both pale (as does Pavarotti) in comparison to Franco Corelli, who is THE Calaf of all time and is caught at his peak of godlike perfection in the RAI film. Cecilia Gasdia is the best Liu of these three, with a sweet fragility to her voice and character, though both Leona Mitchell for Levine and Renata Mattioli for Previtali are good.  Veteran Ivo Vinco (husband of famed mezzo-soprano Fiorenza Cossotto) is superior to Paul Plishka for Levine and almost on a par with Plinio Clabassi for Previtali.  While the Franco Zeffirelli staging for the Met is in a class by itself, and the RAI film version very intriguing, this outdoor venue stating is quite traditional and satisfying, making good use of the additional horizontal and vertical space it provides for crowd scenes and movement of characters.

All three of these versions have unique strengths and are well worth having.  I couldn't imagine doing without any of them, so don't ask me to say that one is better than another -- just get all three and revel in them!  For those who are interested, the audio portion of this performance has also been released on CD.",1366502400,8,3094,5.009746588693957
8271997,5,B00195FUG4,"The seller really needs to correct the spelling error of the item for sale.
However,
It is a wonderful recording. Dimitrova is an absolute vocal goddess as Turandot. Martinucci is a wonderful Calaf.
It's live, which to me is the only way to experience opera.
One of my top 5.
Watched it 2x in a row when it arrived :)",1336003200,3,317,4.3
8271998,3,B00195FUG4,"No doubt I am spoiled by the Metropolitan production of Turandot with Eva Marton, but I was distracted throughout by the sloppy appearance of the Princess.  Why a floppy shapeless dress that looked like a bedsheet, and ungroomed hair that looks like your worst nightmare?  The straight hair to the ankles seemed downright dangerous, but even worse it was ridiculous.  Lui's slavegirl dress had more style and so did her hair.

Am I mistaken, or did they cut the third act short?  Final scene between Calaf and Turandot was shorter than other versions I have seen.

Other than the above, I liked the performance.  The singing was terrific, and the acting was better than other wooden performances.  Still, the gold standard is the Metropolitan's Marton/Domingo.",1260057600,8,760,5.024
8271999,4,B00195FUG4,"At the moment there are two DVDs of Turandot and one on Blu-ray but is not yet published, the other two should be considered as a bench-mark.
Those two are: Turandot with Ghena Dimitrova in the title roll of Turandot, and the other is the Eva Marton (Metropolitan/Zefirelli/Levine).
A direct comparison between these two stars voices is rewarding:
Even with the 'personalized' microphons extensively used to capture the sound of the singers at the Verona Arena, one could perceive how big and intense Ghena Dimitrova's voice actually is (when she begun to sing - I though for a second that she might be a latent Mezzo-Soprano, that's where her lower register is concern...I later looked at the internet to seek her up and was, not much surprised, to learn that at the start of her vocal studies she was categorized as a Mezzo-Soprano...)
And here lies the clove between Ghena Dimitrova, and Eva Marton:
Eva Marton has very little substance to her voice at the lower register - to a degree that it almost disappears (sunken-down) for a duration of a phrase or two.
One should also observe that Ghena Dimitrova's lower register is 'cut from a different cloth' than her mid-register and surly it is different from her top register. Both singers' mid-register and top register are full throat-ed with a lot of substance and ""bloom"" (Eva Marton's top register is more 'silvery' while Ghena Dimitrova's sounds more like a 'golden trumpet' and the voice is pushed forward with lots of muscle and power reserves.
BOTH  ARE  EXCELLENT choice for Turandot.
The staging with the Verona Arena can hardly compete with the colorful Franco Zeffirelli Metropolitan opera staging.
With all of the people on the Arena stage it still looks unpopulated and uninspiring. One can only imagine what that stage would look like with a grand Zeffirelli staging)...
The support cast for the metropolitan production is as good as that of the Verona Arena:
Timur's portrayal by Paul Frishka is inspiring and hold well against bass veteran Ivo Vinco (at the Verona Arena).
While Liu portrayal with Cecilia Gasodia (for the Arena production) has the best ever Liu singing: fresh, young-sounding, almost innocent and her looks is so childish at a time, girlish-like, that it immediately convinces you (I am quite certain that the singer Cecilia Gasodia would have made a marvelous Mimi in La-Bohem, Marguerite in Faust, Gilda in Rigoletto and more...) Yet, the Metropolitan production has Leona Mitchell in that same roll. Leona Mitchell singing and phrasing makes the text and the reason she has for staying with the old blind king a heart breaking conviction when she responds to Calaf (Flacido Domingo) saying to him, ""Because ones, at the old palace, you smiled at me..."" The way Leona Mitchell works that phrase makes the whole character of Liu and her motivation clear and justified. Actually, because of that the roll of Liu and her reasoning is much more clearer than Turandot's motivation as a whole.
And than you have (with the Metropolitan) Placido Domingo...(a bit later in his carrier but still in excellent vocal shape, where he still can touch the Nessun Dorma;s high C - but unfortunately he has to let it go in a very short span of time, not clinging to it as the younger Martinucci (for the Arena production). Martinucci's voice is fresh, right into the pitch, silvery and exact. He should have been considered as one of the best Italian tenor
in the best sense of the true Italian singing tradition (for the pictures, one would wish he was a foot taller and build more robustly, so as to posses a more stage vigor.
Amongst other singers; not to forget the old emperor's roll: the Metropolitan has the best ever emperor in sung/played/spoken/ by veteran Hugues Cuenod (I believe he is on stage for more than 50 years now...)
To sum it up:
The choice of buying should be BOTH.
You CAN NOT fully grasp what the Turandot is all about (vocally) without both DVDs The roll of Turandot is an extremely difficult with lots of demands on the voice.
It has to be sung almost all of the time in Forte and increase to Fore-Fortissimo; one high note leading to an even higher note with no pause for a breath in between (it is not for nothing that Ghena Dimitrova tells the interviewer that she do not like to sing this roll too many times. And one should know that Callas said she abandoned this roll at the first chance she got. Lilly Lehman said she would prefer to sing three consecutive Wagner Isolde and not one Turandot...)
This is a difficult roll carried out superbly by both; Ghena Dimitrova and by Eva Marton. My personal tendency leans towards Ghena Dimitrova and the Verona Arena if only for the pure vocal talents there.",1258502400,23,4707,4.788437884378844
8272000,4,B00195FUG4,"A great production.  Nicely filmed for 1984.  Beautiful setting, beautiful voices, beautiful singers.  What more could I want?",1231372800,5,126,5.888888888888889
8272001,4,B00195FUG4,"The open air Arena di Verona is transformed into an arctic-looking ancient Peking, all the more sympathetic for Dimitrova's gargantuan, monolithic, icy Turandot.  Her voice has never been heard to greater advantage--the acuti are resplendently full and throbbing, the middle is voluptuous, free of the wobble that later afflicted it, and the bottom notes threatening in the riddle scene.  She is attired in a shapeless white gown; her black hair cascades to the floor in great sheathes.  She looks like some primitive Kabuki-inspired vision of woman as temptress-destroyer, inhumanly confident and imposing.  Her rival Marton may have the edge on Dimitrova in acting, but Dimitrova clearly sweeps the field with the sheer power, range, and ease of her voice.  Madame Dimitrova is partnered with the always reliable, if hardly inspiring, Nicola Martinucci--he looks a bit like an Italianate Sonny Bono outmatched by a physically and vocally grander Cher.  Cecilia Gasdia is a touching, fragile, and very lyrical Liu.  But the raison d'etre for this production and the main reason for seeing it is clearly the spectacle of the leading lady.  Daniel Oren conducts the somewhat pedestrian orchestra and chorus.",1220227200,23,1206,5.343915343915344
