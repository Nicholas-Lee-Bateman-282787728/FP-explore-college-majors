the only thing was it seemed a little weird, like iron man not really acting like iron man and I mean actor and script, maybe tv people did their own thing with this? I don't know..

with these as the only captain America cartoons really even now in 2014 every episode is treasure if your favorite hero is captain America.
I really do not understand how they come out with so many cartoons of heroes like iron man, millions of spider man ect.. but still no captain America cartoon now, they got The Avengers with cap in it, but still no solo captain America cartoon now a days and its 2014, don't we live in America?

when I was a kid I was patriotic, I loved America, anything that had the American flag on it I had to have it, so discovering captain America comics was a dream come true, the perfect hero for me, and he was skinny, bullied, but still wanted to do the right thing and fight for his country, it's literally like my story too except without the costume lol.
With them not making any captain America cartoon but they make plastic man and hulk cartoons it makes you wonder if they even want us to care about America or hate it",1393718400,,1319,4.268

I used to watch the Marvel action hour as a kid and i would always remember that how on some weeks it would be cap and the avengers as opposed to just cap. This is great for all of us old schoolers I cant wait for marvel to release these on dvd. Hey if the superfriends can be on dvd, why not the Avengers?",1137369600,3,343,3.8450704225352115
