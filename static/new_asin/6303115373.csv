1174987,1,6303115373,"This movie was out-of-date when it was produce in 1980. It reeks of the politically correctness movement of the Psyco- sixties & seventies. Even out of the bargain bin, this was no bargain.",1111190400,,189,4.757575757575758
1174988,5,6303115373,"I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE,I WATCHED IT WHEN IT FIRST WAS ON TELEVISION IN 1980.
I FIND ROBERT CONRADS ROLE IN THIS MOVIE COMMENDABLE,HE PORTRAYS SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO BUCK AUTHORITY IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT THE RESIDENTS FROM THE ST.CHARLES CORRECTIONAL FACILITY ARE CAPABLE OF BEING DECENT PERSONS WITH DIGNITY AND ARE CAPABLE OF ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING IN SOCIETY.
ID ALSO LIKE TO COMMEND RED WESTS ROLE IN THIS MOVIE,IN THE ROLE OF SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY,HE DOUBTED THE RESIDENTS COULD ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING WORTHWHILE,AND IN THE END DECIDED TO LET THEM PROVE IT,WHICH THEY DID.
I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.",1059782400,,640,5.163461538461538

1174991,2,6303115373,"I have to admit I have very personal reasons for having purchased several copies of this 1980 made for T.V. movie; my family and I were extras in the football audiance!  I was 15 at the time and it was being filmed in Mooseheart, Illinois (between Aurora and Batavia.  Yes, Mooseheart is the villiage for orphans and other disadvantaged children of Moose club members (I lived there for six months when I was in third grade).  The highlight for my family was the scene of the black woman and white man together in the audiance watching the game.  You could see the top of my sister Noel's head sitting right below them (she was 12 at the time).  I sent a copy to family members for Christmas.
Now, about the movie itself.  It was about what you'd expect from a ""made for TV"" movie.  It was somewhat hokie at times, but still a fairly interesting drama.  Robert Conrad plays a coach who's frustrated by his inabilty to walk as a result of a Vietnam War injury.  Turned down from coaching the Chicago Bears (talk about shooting for the stars!) he reluctantly takes up a ""temporary"" coaching position at the youth reform school at St. Charles, Illinois (filmed on location) as a way of keeping his eye on his recently incarcerated nephew.  In the process he turns a motley bunch of unruly youths into a formidable football team.  The highlight of the movie comes when the team is allowed to play an elite prep school outside the reformatory grounds.
The drama is good but not spectacular.  Nevertheless, it's worth watching at least once.  One has to chuckle when reminded of the datedness of the movie at the end.  As the youths get ready to return back to the reform school, a naive cheerleader asks one of the boys to go out with her next weekend.  When he says he won't be available for awhile, she asks ""when?"", and he replies ""1982."" (Wow, that far into the future?!)

Anyway, this movie is inexpensive to purchase & well worth the price.

She is so beautiful and so fun in this movie, much like her Green Acres character.  The plot is kind of silly and fun but it's a joy to watch and just enjoy!",1360540800,,263,3.5964912280701755

7901847,3,6303115373,I was in the stands with my sister during filming at Moose heart School.  Robert Conrad seemed very professional.  My performance as a fan was second to none however :).,1518134400,,169,4.6
7901848,3,6303115373,"This 1980 made-for-tv movie is a lightweight feel-good movie that relies too much on cliche and set pieces.  As a one-time watch, like on Amazon Prime or similar service, it is an okay family movie.  However, the overly predictable plot and ending are likely to be boring for many people.

Robert Conrad of the original ""Wild, Wild, West"" is disabled veteran of Vietnam Jim Brandon.  Before being injured in the war, Brandon was a former professional football player.  After returning to his home town, Brandon hopes to get a job as a football coach, but the school is unable to see past Brandon's disabilities.  Brandon decides he wants to be a coach at a youth prison after his nephew ends up in the prison, and after he gets ridiculed.

From this point forward, all the familiar tropes are in place.  There are the relatively good kids, the relatively bad kids, the escape attempts, etc.  There is the challenge against the local football champions, where the kids predictably lose, along with the standard post-loss set piece that eventually leads to the ""dramatic"" ending.

The issue with this movie is its predictability.  After watching the first 15 or 20 minutes of the movie, it takes about 5 or 10 minutes to plot out the significant plot points of the movie to the end.  Even so, the ending is the single really enjoyable moment of the movie that provides the sole saving grace for having watched the rest of the movie, and we did enjoy the ending.

Our rating here is cautious.  On the one hand, we enjoyed the ending, although it was predictable.  On the other hand, most of the movie followed a predictable path.  We suspect that many people would consider this movie a one or two star movie.  On the other hand, the feel good ending and the good decisions made by the boys are going to appeal to other viewers.  We decided to split the difference and give this movie a three star rating.  However, that three star rating is primarily based on the feel good messages in the movie and the happy ending.  If those aspects of this movie are of insufficient appeal, then it might be better to pass this one by.

Typically, our last word is how we feel about the product we are rating.  We decided that the proper ending is ""enjoy,"" but for others, it will be ""good luck.""  So, consider that our rating might not apply to everyone!

Enjoy!",1509840000,,2348,4.5889423076923075
