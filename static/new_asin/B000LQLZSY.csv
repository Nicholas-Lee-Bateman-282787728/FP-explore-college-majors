8163699,5,B000LQLZSY,"This is not DVIDIA (professional) track dance instruction but for the casual dancer or people who are just getting into it, it is perfect.  They are very low key and the patterns are easy to learn.  Get the intermediate first.",1354579200,,226,4.625
8163700,5,B000LQLZSY,"I reviewed hundreds of dance instruction DVDs, and everyone agreed that this one is excellent. We have been practicing with both the Intermediate and Waltz and Foxtrot and find it very well done. The instructions assume you know the basics, however; there is no beginner level blow-by-blow of each move. You can, however, hit ""pause"" on your DVD player, then hit the ""fast forward"" button several times to get a slowed-down version of the steps if you need more of a break-down.",1232755200,,478,4.841463414634147
