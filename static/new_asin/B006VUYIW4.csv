5021467,5,B006VUYIW4,"I purchased this and other Tom and Jerry DVD's for my grandchildren to enjoy when they visit. After the visit, I let them take them home because they want to watch them again. The cartoons make them laugh out loud, and their parents said when they take them on road trips for viewing from the back seat, they can tell that the children are enjoying them.",1378598400,,354,4.378787878787879

5021469,5,B006VUYIW4,"A month or so ago, I picked up a collection of the old Tom and Jerry cartoons on DVD with the idea that my young son (almost four) might like them. Well, they were a big hit, even though the cartoons were originally meant to be shown in movie theaters to mainly adult audiences. It just didn't matter. In no time at all he was chortling at the antics of the cat and mouse. Next, I found a couple Tom and Jerry DVDs that were derived from a TV show made specifically for children. Well, he liked these too, although my guess would be that he slightly preferred the original movie theater cartoons.

In any case, my latest discovery is a ""Tom and Jerry: World Champions"" DVD. I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart. It's a well done collection of cartoons where the connecting theme is some type of sport or sports-related activity. Bowling, golf, billiards, body building, soccer and hockey come to mind. Some of the cartoons are the old movie theater ones and some are derived from the children's TV show. It's a good collection. My boy was laughing and even screaming at the antics of Tom bowling and golfing, even though he has zero experience with those sports. Kids just know funny stuff when they see it and these cartoons are funny stuff. I might add that I enjoyed sitting with the little guy and we both had some good laughs. I admit, partly I was laughing at his enjoyment. It's  a good DVD.

8505131,5,B006VUYIW4,Tom & Jerry are from my generation (the 50's and 60's).  I still enjoy watching them and my grandchildren twins 6 and 3 1/2  years old just love them!

8505132,5,B006VUYIW4,"I chose 5 stars because Tom and Jerry is something I grew up with. When my mom bought this and brought it over for my son (2 years old) I wasn't sure he was going to like it yet but he sits and watches it and giggles the whole time. As for my husband and myself, it is nice to be able to sit down and watch a cartoon that we haven't seen since we were kids. Highly recommend this DVD for anyone who is a Tom and Jerry fan.",1401667200,,422,3.7
