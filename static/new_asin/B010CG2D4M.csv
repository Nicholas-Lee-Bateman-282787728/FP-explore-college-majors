8722018,2,B010CG2D4M,"Rhonda (Daja Bonnett) is a newscaster in Atlanta and has on ""on air"" breakdown over her boyfriend. Her cousin, nurse Kim (Pam Banks) is a serial dater, comes to her rescue. The film concerns their lives and ""escapades"" but I found it boring and the laughs rather low brow. It is described as a sexy film, but it is mostly all talk and no action.
