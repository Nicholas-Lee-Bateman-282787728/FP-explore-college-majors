585679,5,6303124526,"I started out by buying Richard Scarry's counting DVD.  I loved it so much, I bought all the rest (minus the nursery rhymes DVD).  My 2-year-old son really enjoys watching the movie, as does my 6-month-old daughter. I personally enjoy the DVD and its innocence. I like that it is simple yet captivating for them. It really holds their attention. I tend to be pretty particular when it comes to movies for my children, making sure they don't teach any bad habits and that it doesn't teach anything contrary to the Bible. I was very pleased to see there wasn't any reference to magic, fairies, etc, as many things tend to include such references these days.",1052006400,23,655,4.637931034482759
585680,5,6303124526,"My wife and I first found this at the video store and I'm ordering it along with the Best Learning Songs Ever. I remember fondly the books from childhood and was pleased to see the stories and art are just as fun as ever. Our 2 year old sits entranced. If you're like us you end up listening to and memorizing all your toddler's videos. This video is easy to hear and see over and over, and is a great break from that wonderful, but high-pitched and hyper entertainer, Elmo.",1018569600,23,474,4.277777777777778
7839872,5,6303124526,"This has to be, bar none, my kids' all-time favorite video.  Have not seen it on DVD, but have a combo unit to play this tape on.  It is one of the best buys ever!  this is, in fact, my second tape, as we played the first one so much, we actually wore it down.  It has the usual cast of cute characters and fun stories the Richard Scarry was famous for, but this is infused with many catchy songs that my kids LOVE.  Whether it comes out on DVD or video, your kids are bound to love this collection of stories with light life lessons about kindness and such woven through it.  My 12 year old daughter still visits it once in awhile for ""old-times sake"" with her little sister, as the stories are funny to watch, she can still get the humor.",1512000000,,740,4.104166666666667

7839875,5,6303124526,soooo sweet! the tunes are very catchy...my five year old is still singing these songs!..lol. quality of product was great and so was packaging delivery. Super happy with my purchase!,1377302400,,183,5.133333333333334
7839876,3,6303124526,"The price is right but there's hardly anything on this video.

On the plus side, it's the old-school quiet Richard Scarry animation, not the annoying Busytown series.",1354233600,,166,5.148148148148148
7839877,4,6303124526,"I recently purchased the following videos: Best ABC Video, Best Counting Video, Best Learning Songs, Best Silly Stories & Songs, Best Busy People.  These videos are all about 15-20 years old (release date) and I had my reservations as to whether my 3 year old would like them, as he is very stuck on his LeapFrog letter and words videos (which I also love).  When I first viewed all of these, I realized that they are made with very simple animation, similar to when I was young.  These videos are extremely charming and sweet.  My son instantly loved them and has asked to view them repeatedly.  It was nice to have a video with the actual alphabet song, as the LeapFrog letter factory does not have it.  The counting video is also helpful in that it counts to 20 rather than 10 as other videos do.  He enjoys the silly stories and laughs at all the videos.  It is nice to know that kids can still enjoy classics such as these.  I am very pleased with them.  I also paid less than $1 or $2 for each of them (plus shipping).  A bargain!",1206057600,,1036,4.316062176165803
7839878,5,6303124526,This is one of the best children's videos that we have.  Our three year old grandson loves the characters and sits quietly while watching it.  It is excellent for pre bedtime or anytime he needs to rest.  The songs are memorable and the little characters are sweet and polite.,1163030400,2,276,4.591836734693878
7839879,5,6303124526,"My 4 year old son loves these videos, we had owned all but this one.  He watches this one over and over because the stories in this video are in his books, so now he sees them 'come to life' on tv.  Highly recommend these videos as they contain nice gentle songs and dialogue.  Very relaxing to watch for my son and not annoying for me.",1140739200,6,336,4.0606060606060606
7839880,5,6303124526,Both my kids love this DVD.  It appeals to ages 1-7 and keeps them happy and quiet for a long time.  Yeah!,1120953600,2,106,3.772727272727273
