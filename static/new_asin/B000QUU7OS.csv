8325659,2,B000QUU7OS,"I was so excited waiting for this dvd arrive, because I already watched it a long time ago... Unfortunately I get little disappointed, because they cut off huge part of the original series, seams to me they edit the original and squeezed the series removing a lots of interesting facts, as when the family went to the living museum to learn about how to operate things properly in Victorian times, using the period products, and lots of historical information, so, I don't know why they just cut it off. The original series is really good, though.",1509667200,,547,4.708333333333333
