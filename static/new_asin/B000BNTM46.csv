2430023,5,B000BNTM46,"Without a doubt, these Everybody Loves Raymond sets are the thing to collect if you are an avid fan of the classic show. They have indeed been released in a very timely manner, and we are already over the halfway mark with the number of season sets that have come out in the series.

Season 5 delivers the same funny and genuine episodes you are used to seeing from this series. The two-part season opener ""Italy"" delivers a notably different atmosphere and plot than fans are used to, and I have found that people either loved it or hated it, but after that the show returns to its usual self. The classic ""Wallpaper"" episode is just hilarious, and I was also personally partial to the season finale ""Ally's Birth,"" where Ray reminisced about the crazy ""Barone style"" events surrounding Debra's pregnancy with their first child. Also notable are the the two-part season opener ""Italy,"" which has a significantly more sensitive plot that may not suit some fans but is still worth watching; ""Super Bowl,"" where Ray takes drastic measures to prove he loves Debra more than his Super Bowl tickets; and of course, ""The Canister,"" which chronicles one of the most hilarious Debra/Marie conflicts in the show's 9-year run. (This episode was also among the most popular ""fan favorites"" and is a real keeper!)

There isn't really a large number of special features on these sets, although the audio commentaries are very consistent and nice to have. I am glad that Patricia Heaton has also joined in on a couple of them on Seasons 4 and 5. The only thing I would like to see more of is the cast members talking about the Barone kids. Madylin, Sawyer, and Sullivan Sweeten were obviously not a huge part of the show at all, but Phil Rosenthal, Ray Romano, and Patricia Heaton don't talk about them at all in the commentaries, and it would be nice to see how these actors related to them and gain more insight on the relationship that they shared while working on the show. Hopefully we will see a little more of this in future DVD releases...but in general, this is, of course, an outstanding show and I can't wait to own the whole series.",1138492800,8,2130,4.632275132275132
2430024,5,B000BNTM46,"i live in the uk and am dissapointed this show really isn't being released onto dvd as well as it is in the usa, we currently have available seasons 1 and 2, and usa has all the way to season 5, however i buy them from the usa because i absolutely love this show, does anyone know when the next season will be out????

how many seasons in total was there?? i think it was 9 but im not sure.",1136073600,2,390,3.875
2430025,4,B000BNTM46,"I have been very happy with the first four seasons of the show on DVD. The only thing that I don't like about this season is the fact that it is in widescreen. I hate widescreen, especially on a t.v. show. I can handle it a little better if it were a movie. It is kind of painful to watch. That is a shame since it is a great show. I hope that season six comes in standard format like it is shown in television.",1135123200,5,411,3.847058823529412
2430026,5,B000BNTM46,"All the episodes in Season 5 are extremely funny and worth all the award nominations and wins the show received that year. The best episodes are ""Italy (Part 1 & 2)"", ""Wallpaper"", ""Meant To Be"", and ""Stefania Arrives."" It was great to see David Proval (Mean Streets, The Sopranos) guest star as Stefania's Father too! The entire cast were amazing, really good comedy, and The Fifth Season of Everybody Loves Raymond can represent the entire series.",1134691200,4,448,4.907894736842105
2430027,5,B000BNTM46,"I AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SEASON FIVE RELEASE DUE OUT ON OR ABOUT DEC. 6TH 2005. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS RELEASE FOR SOMETIME.AS WITH ALL TV SEASON BOXED SETS,THEY DONT ALWAYS INCLUDE EVERY EPISODE,IN EACH SET.I HOPE SEASON FIVE IS COMPLETE.THIS WAS MY FAVORITE SEASON OF RAYMOND,AND I THINK THE BEST OF THE SERIES.",1130803200,5,329,4.689655172413793
2430028,5,B000BNTM46,"Why I like the show:
* always amusing to hilarious family situations that you can identify with or laugh at(and hope it never happens to you).
*great cast of performers that really knew their characters and excelled at them.
* one of the sexiest/cutest moms to grace tv(i'm talking about Debra!), that's NOT trying to be sexy/cute.
* a who's who of stand-up comics making appearances: Dave Attel, Andy Kindler, Fred Stoller, Kevin James, Ray Romano, Brad Garret, etc.
* during the first season, maybe even after the first show, they started to find their groove.  by the second season and beyond, they were hitting on all cylinders imo.  (and now, seasons 1 & 2 are under $20 each)
* no shows emphasizing how cute the kids can be, no desperate ratings grabber by having Debra pregnant, and thank goodness the show went off the air before we got those shows emphasizing the teenage hijinx of the kids all grown-up(like other shows did at some point to boost ratings/condescend to viewers)
* it started out low-key, and ended low-key.  no major hype and annoying year long finales.  a 'modest' show that succeeded on its merits(writing, performances, comedy, etc).

as for season 5 specifically, another great season that seems to emphasize Robert's character and his female troubles.  Can't wait.  and thanks to the reviewer that listed the episode guide, always helpful.",1130544000,28,1370,4.930434782608696
2430029,5,B000BNTM46,"I am so impressed with the timeliness in which they are releasing the ELR seasons on DVD.  This is the way it should be!  Here's the episode guide for Season 5:

1. Italy (Part 1) - When Marie surprises the family with the news that she's treating them all to a two-week vacation in Rome, everybody loves the idea--except Raymond.

2. Italy (Part 2) - When Marie surprises the family with the news that she's treating them all to a two-week vacation in Rome, everybody loves the idea--except Raymond.

3. The Wallpaper - After Ray and Debra lose their cool when Frank and Marie pull the ultimate unannounced visit to their home, Ray finally reaches the breaking point with his parents and kicks them out of his house.

4. Meant to Be  - Robert finds himself in the most unlikely position of having to choose one of three women--girlfriend Amy, ex-wife Joanne or Italian bombshell Stefania--to share the future with him.

5. Pet Cemetery - Ray inadvertently commits ""pet-slaughter"" on Ally's hamster while Debra and the kids are away for the weekend.

6. The Author - The competition for attention between Ray and Robert reaches an all-time high with the brothers ending up in a fight. Ray's dreams of authoring a sports book get squashed when the publishing company takes a pass on it, just as Robert receives the good news that he is being promoted to lieutenant.

7. The Walk to the Door - Ray is mortified when he meets a girl whom he dated 25 years earlier and believes he treated with disrespect.

8. Young Girl - Robert starts to date a 22-year old woman and Marie and Debra don't think it is right.

10. The Sneeze - Ray fears that he is going to come down with something dreadful after someone sneezes on him.

11. Christmas Present - Ray buys Debra an elaborate Christmas gift in the hopes that she will be so impressed, she will let him go on a weekend golf trip with his buddies.

12. What Good Are You?  - When Ray doesn't react to Debra's choking everyone makes fun of him so he tries to be more attentive in similar situations.

13. Super Bowl - Ray gets to go to the Super Bowl and cover it for his newspaper. He brings Gianni but feels bad about not having brought Debra when he sees that all the other reporters brought their wives.

14. Ray's Journal - Ray is mortified when he realizes that Marie used to read the personal journal he kept as a teenager.

15. Silent Partners - Ray and Debra discover that they have nothing to talk about except the kids.

16. Fairies - Ray is upset when he finds out that Debra signed up Michael and Geoffrey to play fairies in a school play.

17. Stefania Arrives - Robert gets a surprise visit from Stefania, the woman with whom he fell head over heels in love when the Barones vacationed in Italy.

18. Humm Vac  - Ray purchases a new state-of-the-art vacuum cleaner from an attractive door to door saleswoman and it ignites a housekeeping war between Marie and Debra.

19. The Canister - Tempers flare when Marie accuses Debra of not returning a borrowed canister that holds sentimental value and Debra insists that she has already given it back. Debra is then horrified when she discovers that she does indeed still have the canister in her possession.

20. Net Worth - Debra becomes angry when Ray contributes $1,000 to his friends' hair brained scheme to open a go-cart business without first consulting her.

21. Let's Fix Robert - Marie gathers Robert's ex-girlfriends Amy and Stefania and his female police partner, Judy, together so they can dissect his character in an effort to help her better understand why Robert can't commit to a relationship.

22. Say Uncle - When Ray realizes that his kids would rather spend time with their Uncle Robert than with him, he decides to do something about the situation.

23. Separation - Debra gets upset when she finds out that her parents have separated.

24. Frank Paints the House - When Ray and Debra find Frank painting their house, they find out that Marie put him up to the job due to his retirement. But, when Frank paints it a color they don't like, Ray fires him.

25. Ally's Birth - As Ray escorts Ally to a father-daughter dance, he realizes how grown up and independent his daughter has become. As a result, he begins to recall the day, nine years ago, when the Barone clan welcomed her into the family, but not without incident.",1129420800,80,4497,4.585
2430030,5,B000BNTM46,"This is definitely my favorite show of all time!  All the characters are hilarious, from Ray (Ray Romano), Debra (Patricia Heaton), Robert (Brad Garrett), Frank (Peter Boyle), and Marie (Doris Roberts), it is just an outstanding cast of actors, actresses, and writers!  This season has some classic episodes, from ""Italy"" to ""Humm Vac"" to ""The Canister"" and then one of my favorite episodes ""Frank Paints The House.""  This season won many Emmys too.  Patricia Heaton won Best Actress and Doris Roberts won Best Supporting Actress.  This truly is a fantastic comedy about an Italian-American family who just make everybody laugh and have a great time.  I can't wait until the next seasons come out on DVD.",1128729600,8,704,5.025862068965517

2430085,4,B000BNTM46,"Originally, I was not a fan of the series. I was not a fan of how the family was portrayed and the humor was a bit dry and obvious. Somehow, after watching several seasons, now it has grown on me. I find the comedy around marriage, raising kids, dealing with in-laws, and the development of the characters entertaining. My family and I watch an episode a day, as a way to laugh, talk through things, and unwind. One of the reasons I do appreciate it a bit more is that it is more family friendly than what is on television now. There is very minimal cursing, and that doesn't come into play until almost the end of the fourth season. (That I can recall).",1417392000,,654,4.282258064516129

2430164,5,B000BNTM46,"One of my favorite episodes.  Shot with a different tone than the live audience shows, still with the same humor but has a warm side that showcases Italy for how beautiful it is.  This episode also shows, in a classic laugh out loud way, how family vacations can be complex with everyone involved in their own problems. It also reveals the bigger picture which is to enjoy being fortunate to have family to spend time with and to live in the moment before you miss it.  There are few places on earth where this is more true than in Italy.",1389744000,,538,4.36

2430170,5,B000BNTM46,"There is no question why this show went nine seasons straight. If you're married with kids, you will be rolling on the floor with laughter. Raymond is the dense, sports-absorbed husband; Debra, his wife, the intelligent, but moody, manager of the household; while Marie is the meddling mother-in-law across the street with her tactless, slob husband Frank. Add to this Raymond's under-appreciated, insecure, police officer brother who is tall enough to put petite Debra on eye-level with his belly-button, and you've got a sit-com that often gives you a gut-ache from laughing so hard. At times, tears literally flow down my face. And this is even after I've seen every episode multiple times. The picture of family life portrayed in this sit-com is priceless. It doesn't matter which season you start with, you will soon be purchasing all the others. All the actors are perfectly cast for their parts. It's the best therapy at the end of any stressful day!",1388102400,,957,4.9875

2430194,4,B000BNTM46,"The show is a classic I think . . . or will be. Good family fun for the most part (except the constant begging for sex which gets old more than it is offensive). The father figure should be a little more stand up but we live in a women dominated world where men are usually emasculated like this. The main characters is sometimes such a lazy stupid loser that I don't see how anyone would marry him. But I think this is done for comedy. But overall it is funny and reruns are just as fun. I think whoever wrote the mother-in-law role was very spot on. She is the perfect hater lover like such people can most of the time be.

The one mix up that keeps happening is that the writers forget where the characters live. They live in New York--Long Island, not New Jersey. But in several seasons and episodes they keep ""missing New Jersey"". Silly.",1375056000,,842,4.2625

But I forgot - did I ever realize? - how good ALL the shows are!  I don't think there's a bad show in this fifth season collection, and I recall others from other seasons, so I'm going to have to buy the complete collection.

Love it.",1374105600,,406,4.52054794520548

2430275,3,B000BNTM46,"Reading the comments of other reviewers I was intrigued at myself as to why I did not like this season as much as they did. Instead of getting carried over with the momentum of the previous 4 seasons, if we treat season 5 on its own merit, it is a little bit below average. The situations are forced, the actors are forced to fit into their stereotypes, periodic overacting are some of the many issues that plague this season. One reviewer pointed out that the writer had changed for this season. May be that could be a reason. The previous 4 seasons had an element of natural-ness to the sitcom, while in this season the plot feels like it is a result of a hardly-thought-over-process. On repeated viewing, however, I should say that I got used to this season's flavor and started to like it too. Since Amazon does not let me change the rating, I just would like to state here that this season deserves a 4 star lenient rating and not a strict 3 star rating that I have done.

On a macroscopic level, ELR is much better than many other sitcoms of its age.",1216339200,,1056,4.3604060913705585

One of the hi-lights in this great series includes the episode Wallpaper in which Marie drives into Ray and Debra's living room.  One of the hilarious episodes includes Ray finding out that Marie read his diary which included some incredibly private [measurement] moments.  Four solid stars.",1183852800,,573,5.118279569892473
2430279,5,B000BNTM46,"This season starts with the two-episode Italy trip which was OK, but I normally do not care for episodes of shows that are placed out of the usual setting.  In reviewing the other episodes, this season may be my favorite of ELR.  There are so many highlights including the famous ""Wallpaper"" episode where Ray's parents drive through their house.  My other favorites include ""The Author,"" ""The Walk to the Door,"" ""The Sneeze,"" ""What Good Are You?"" (my favorite of this season--it is just hilarious), ""Fairies,"" ""Humm Vac,"" and ""The Canister.""  Extras include deleted scenes (on the DVD with the corresponding episodes which is nicer than all of them on the 5th DVD) and a few commentaries on selected episodes.  The subtitles sometimes come up when I start a new episode but, going to the title menu and selecting ""Language,"" I can turn off the subtitles and can resume the episode where it left off.

Disc 1:
""Italy Parts 1 & 2""--Marie treats her family to a trip to Italy.  Raymond is in the dumps until the end of the trip and Robert meets Stefania who will make future appearances.
""Wallpaper""--One of the more famous episodes.  Marie and Frank back their car through Raymond and Debra's house.  When the contractors repair the wall and the wallpaper does not quite match, Raymond goes ballistic.  Raymond's reaction seems out-of-character but Debra recognizes it's an explosion over many issues.  Nothing really is resolved here but I don't think Raymond is ever pushed this far again.
""Meant to Be""--Robert decides to settle down with Amy and thinks it's a good idea to tell her about his flings with Stefania and ex-wife Joanna.  Joanna makes an appearance (yuck).
""Pet Cemetery""--Raymond leaves Ally's hamster's cage open and it goes in the freezer and freezes to death.  Raymond learns something about Ally at the funeral.

Disc 2:
""The Author""--Raymond isn't too excited about Robert being promoted to lieutenant because his publisher just rejected his book.  This is the episode where they fight in their mom's living room with ""bugles.""
""The Walk to the Door""--Raymond and his family go to a wedding.  In attendance is a woman Raymond dated one time in high school and he obsesses over not walking her to her door.  Debra is angry that Raymond doesn't regret inconsiderate things he does to her so he comes up with an example of his regret in typical Raymond fashion--he steals it.
""Young Girl""--Robert is dating a 22 year old and Marie and Debra get pushed out of shape.
""Fighting In-Laws""--Debra's parents visit for Thanksgiving and, after Debra gives Ray the usual speech about how normal her family is compared to his, Ray overhears them talking about seeing a marriage counselor.
""The Sneeze""--Raymond is sneezed on at the airport and is paranoid he's caught something.  Debra suspects Ray's mother is enabling his illness.  Very funny one.

Disc 3:
""Christmas Present""--Raymond and Robert try to figure out the best Christmas present to give Debra so she'll let them go on a golfing excursion.
""What Good Are You?""--Raymond does nothing (as usual) while Debra is choking and he starts to think he can't be counted on in an emergency.  Hilarious!  Especially the splinter scene.
""Super Bowl""--Raymond gets two tickets to the Super Bowl and decides to take Gianni which angers Robert, Frank and, believe it or not, even Debra.  It's painful to watch what Debra guilt-trips Raymond into doing to the tickets near the end of this episode.
""Ray's Journal""--Ray's mad when he finds out his mother would read his journal when he was a kid but his mother is mad at him for a hurtful entry.
""Silent Partners""--Debra is worried when she and Ray go out to eat and have nothing to say to each other.

Disc 4:
""Fairies""--Frank does not like his grandsons playing fairies in the school play and Raymond starts to see things his way.  Very funny.
""Stefania""--Robert's girlfriend from Italy arrives and he's bothered by her poking him all the time.  Meanwhile, Stefania's father decides to buy Nemo's.
""Humm Vac""--Raymond buys Debra a Rainbow knockoff super vacuum and Debra thinks she can prove to Marie that she's not the perfect housecleaner. ""This is what we call the `wow factor.'""
""The Canister""--Debra is mad because Marie keeps insisting she never returned her canister.  Frank actually does a good deed here.
""Net Worth""--Debra gets mad (is there a pattern here?) at Raymond because he gave his buddies $1,000 for a Go-Kart investment and told her it was HIS money.  I like when she takes all the sheets off the bed including the mattress cover (very thorough).

Disc 5:
""Let's Fix Robert""--Stefania and Amy meet and discuss all the faults in their ex-boyfriend Robert.
""Say Uncle""--Raymond is worried that his kids are becoming closer to Robert than to him.
""Separation""--Debra finds out her parents are ""on the path to divorce"" and Raymond isn't very sympathetic.
""Frank Paints the House""--Frank is furious when Raymond fires him from painting his house.  I don't care for this episode that much because Frank gets so emotional plus he is totally wrong.  Yellow fades more quickly than almost any exterior color and it does not cover well.
""Ally' Birth""--Raymond takes Ally to a father-daughter dance and thinks back to when Debra was pregnant with her.  The cab scene is a highlight (what was up with Robert's hair?).",1182643200,,5331,4.9284116331096195
2430280,5,B000BNTM46,"The fifth season of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND opens with two of the most poignant and beautiful episodes they have ever filmed (in my opinion).  These are, of course, centered on the trip that the Barone family makes to Italy.  So funny and delightful!  The rest of the episodes tow the line between being brilliant and poignant.  For example, Robert (Brad Garrett) has a hard break-up with his on-again, off-again girlfriend and takes up with Stefania (Alex Meneses), a girl he meets in Italy, as well as meeting other Ms. Wrong's along the way.  Poor Robert.  You want to hug him for being pitiful, and you want to strangle him for being so mopey.  Of course, we also get a sense of the strain in the relationship between Raymond (Ray Romano) and Debra (Patricia Heaton), and their forgiveness and reconciliation that takes place, after their explosive exchanges.  RAYMOND still has it, five years into the program.  Don't miss up this DVD collection.",1180656000,,951,4.857142857142857

2430294,5,B000BNTM46,"I'm really glad for the release of these DVD box sets, because without them, I never would have gotten into this show...now one of my very favorites!

The plot centers upon Ray Barone, a sportswriter living on Long Island with his wife Debra and children Ally, Geoffrey and Michael. The bane of their existence is Ray's parents Marie and Frank...living just across the street, and acting like Ray and Debra's home is an extension of their own. To compound the problem, Ray's older brother Robert, a divorced NYPD lieutenant, moves back home...

This show doesn't look for sophisticated, implausible storylines. Rather, it focuses upon the tiny aspects of everyday life and relationships - father/son, husband/wife, brother/brother, parent/child - and finds comedy in the truth. Ray and Debra often clash, as he just wants to relax when he comes home from work, and she - a stay-at-home mom - wants him to pitch in, or go out. Frank is crass, and Marie is nosy and opinionated.

Season 5 includes a two-part episode taking the entire Barone clan to Italy; a flashback of Ally's birth; and more squabbles about the childhood and adolescent wackiness that both Ray and Robert claim messed them up for life!

If you're unfamiliar with this show, check it out! You'll soon be laughing hysterically and looking for the rest of the seasons.",1164931200,3,1333,4.911111111111111
2430295,5,B000BNTM46,"While I love all nine seasons of Everybody Loves Raymond, seasons 4-7 are undeniably the best. Season 5 is when the show really reached its peak (which carried over through all of season six). Among the memorable occurances in season five are the first time Robert and Stefania meet, a flashback to Ally's birth, Marie's revelation that she has read (and kept) Ray's childhood journal...and a very special trip to Ray's house by Frank and Marie (hint: it involves Frank's car and a soon-to-be-missing living room wall of Ray's home). This is a great season of the show that every fan should own.",1161561600,5,595,4.786407766990291
2430296,5,B000BNTM46,"The fifth season will always have a special place in my heart because it's the first year I started watching the show. I was hooked and watched it until the end of its run, catching the earlier episodes when it entered syndication the next year. (Yes there was a time when this show wasn't in syndication.) The season starts off with the two part ""Italy"" message episode (Ray slowly learns to appreciate life in Italy). It's a nice change of pace for the series, but feels forced. The only thing that happens in Italy relevant to the rest of the series is Robert's meeting of a beautiful woman named Stefania who makes him question whether he should stick with his girlfriend Amy.

This situation is further exploited to serve as the premise of the episodes ""Meant to be"" and ""Stephania Arrives""

Writer Tucker Cawley began to hit his stride this season and began to write some good but overrated episodes (The walk to the door, Silent partners, Ally's birth) I say overrated because if you analyze the episodes he wrote from this season forward, he uses the same plot device over and over again: Ray or Robert does or says something dumb that Debra, Amy, or both way overreact to and a huge argument ensues, which is usually smoothed over at the end. The arguing only got worse in season six, and I believe Cawley is partially to blame.

Classic episodes from this season include ""Humm Vac"", ""Christmas Present"", ""Fighting In-Laws"", and ""The Canister""

Forgettable episodes include ""The Sneeze"" ""What Good Are You?"", ""Fairies"", and ""Net Worth"", where Ray invests money in the go-cart craze.",1149465600,4,1591,4.774545454545454
2430297,3,B000BNTM46,"We absolutely loved the first four seasons of ELR - it is our favourite sitcom. But we felt that season 5 did not match the standard of its predecessors. In particular we felt that Raymond became a lot less lovable, especially for a stretch of episodes mid-season. Whereas before Deborah had issues with Raymond for his cheekiness and innocent mistakes, now it seemed that he had actually ceased to care for Deborah. The Christmas present episode is an example - Raymond bought Debbie an expensive gift just to help his chances with a golfing weekend, and he resented her expensive gift to him because he suspected similar motives. These episodes had a harder edge to the humour that in our view was out of character with the show. Hopefully season 6 (we haven't seen these episodes and will wait for the DVD)returns to the winning formula. We also felt that season 5 had a lot less laughs than earlier seasons. Still better than the average sitcom though. Roll on season 6...",1142985600,6,976,4.713450292397661
