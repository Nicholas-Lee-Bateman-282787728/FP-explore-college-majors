953202,5,6305020892,"This is a great movie that I never get tired of watching. Supposedly it is a sequel that take place a hundred years after the events of the first two movies, but in reality it is more like the cinematic equivalent of a remix of the first movie (same basic storyline with elaborations, same actress playing the heroine, similar character types, and so on). And like the first one, it manages the great alchemical mix of genres and moods: romantic and creepy, action-packed and humorous, haunting and light-hearted. But it succeeds in upping these a notch. The romantic relationship between the hero and the ghostly heroine is complicated and given tension by his being a monk (monastic vows and all) and by her being less overtly benign. The special effects are way, way, way better (which is partly due to the passage of time, of course), and these contribute to the choreography of the action...the part where the senior monk detects the presence of evil and abruptly shoots up from his meditation seat into the air and starts gliding about doing reconnaissance is totally cool no matter how many times I see it. And to top it all off, even the subtitles are better.

Also intensified are the religious motifs and themes, obviously, and while Buddhism and Taoism come out as more distinct in this version, the manner in which they are both portrayed in the popular imagination is again fascinating and intriguing in its own right. Anyone who studies East Asian Buddhism could find a lot of food for thought here...and have a great time doing so, to boot.

So don't deprive yourself of this wonderful, entertaining adventure. Watch and enjoy!",1147305600,4,1642,4.819148936170213
953203,5,6305020892,"""The Art of Leontyne Price"" is a fascinating DVD showing a little known Leontyne(1958) as well as the grand diva she grew to be.

Madame Price was no novice to the stage when she recorded the Aida scene in 1958, but she was definitely not the polished artist that she was to become just a very short time later. New Yorkers knew her phenomenal voice in the early fifties and in 1955 she sang Tosca in a nationally televised performance. (I am anxiously waiting for that to come out on DVD.) The 1958 scene shows a fiery vixen that has yet to be tamed. The voice is young and fresh with that characteristic flutter vibrato in her high silky tessitura. Even with the sound quality from this old recording one hears the beginning of those lush sensual vocal colours which were to become her trademark all over the world.

The diction was better in those early years. On a down note, the acting left much to be desired. The ""fiery vixen"" did calm down, or should I say, controlled her stage presence in later years, but here there is only raw temperament and overly exagerated facial expressions. At times, I had the impression that she was doing a silent movie. The director should have worked out the flaws before taping. She seems to be more true to herself and to Aida when she is just singing and not ""acting"".

  In the 1982 concert we see Leontyne the Great. A full, rich, voluptuous instrument and a truly grand dame of the stage. She begins with ""Come scoglio"" from Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte. It was an exciting brave beginning but the aria no longer settled comfortably into her voice. As the evening progressed and she warmed up, we heard the true greatness of the magnificent lady. ""My man's gone now"" from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess was tragic, painful, and profound. Her famous vocal colours were all evident here and her rubati and ""blue notes"" all enhanced Gershwin's American jazz background which he so artfully orchestrates into a new exhilarating form of classical music-an American music! Madame Price also offers renditions of some of her most famous Italian arias including the Pace, pace, mio Dio. Once you have heard that you know why she was called the ""Diva di tutte le dive!""

This DVD is a ""must"" for all Price fans and lovers of great singing.",1098835200,22,2266,4.610421836228288
953204,3,6305020892,"I was prepared to really enjoy Chinese Ghost Story III, understanding that it was essentially a retread of the original two movies. Since the movie takes place 100 years after the second, there's plenty of good reasons for why the Chinese Ghost Story III would be disconnected from its roots.
Unfortunately, Chinese Ghost Story III suffers from exactly the opposite: it's far too much like Chinese Ghost Story II. Even more unforgivable, the actress who played the ghost in the first story (that was saved, to become reincarnated) and who played the physical twin of the ghost in the second story, is ANOTHER ghost in this story. Another ghost, but not the same ghost. Very annoying.
Back too is the villain, the wicked tree hag with the neverending tongue and influence over tree branches. I don't know about you, but I didn't have a burning desire to find out whatever happened to the tree hag that dove into that hole in the second movie. I mean, really.
The plot is similar - instead of a tax collector seduced by a ghost, we have a monk seduced by a ghost. There's an old mentor who has supernatural powers and there's also a professional demon hunter. The only difference is that the demon hunter in this movie was the student of the old monk in the last movie.
So what does this movie have to offer? Not much. In fact, it's so much like the second movie that the parallels only serve to show just how inferior the second movie is. It's not as scary, not as funny, and not as romantic.
The ending even has a poorly introduced bad guy - the husband to be to the ghost (JUST LIKE THE SECOND MOVIE). In this case, it's the ""Mountain Devil."" The Mountain Devil is apparently a big puppet, and not in the ""hey it's cool cause it's wacky"" kind of way. He animates buildings that look like puppet buildings.
On the whack-I-meter, the old monk manages to cover his eyes with his earlobes. And that's about it. Even the sword stunts and magic tricks can't top Chinese Ghost Story II.
If you've seen the second movie, you don't need to see Chinese Ghost Story III.",1081209600,4,2060,4.510695187165775
953205,4,6305020892,"This is the second episode of a chinese ghost story. the story has a bit of continuation from the first movie. although i feel that it is not as good as the first one, this movie is still very watchable!! highly receommend.",1027728000,2,223,4.333333333333333
953206,4,6305020892,"This movie was a huge step up from the original which I hated. This movie has all the same elements as the first they are just done much better. Joey Wang is great in this film, which is to be expected because she was the lone bright spot in the original. The monk in this film is much better than Leslie Cheung was in the original. His master is also very cool in this movie. There was not much tongue killing in this movie which helps it. I also feel the romance is much better in this film. This movie is like a remake of the original but just better. To all I hope you buy this movie and pretend that there is not a part one.",1011139200,2,629,3.9606299212598426
953207,3,6305020892,"I'm not sure what the previous viewer is refering to, but this is the final (so far, and hopefully always) chapter in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy.  The first one came out in '87, then '90 and '91.  This film is decent, good fight sequences, though it is weaker in the specail effects than the previous films.  However Leslie Cheung is not in this film (par the previous film) and Joey Wang has a diminished role in this one.  Three might be a crowd.  Check out the other two before you see this one.",990057600,,503,4.308510638297872
953208,5,6305020892,"This is just a warning for old school cinema hong kong fans. You may do what I did... buy this video thinking it's a new ghost story movie. This is the 1991 version which was originally titled 'Chinese Ghost Story 2'. I already had this tape in my library so I was looking forward to seeing what I thought would be a previously unseen feature. After tracking Amazon. Com's video selections, I came to learn that this movie is actually 'A Chinese Ghost Story 2', the movie they're selling as 'ghost story 2' is actually the original 'A Chinese Ghost Story'. And what they're selling as 'chinese ghost story', is a children's animated feature from 1987 of the same title. This isn't Amazon's fault, this confusing mess is due to Tai Seng Distribution's updating the marketing on their video catalogue  for international retail. This apparently required changing the titles of movies and their sequels (!?!).
On to the review. If you've never seen this movie, but are interested in Cinema Hong Kong, this is an absolute treat. It captures all the action and visual eye candy of Hong Kong's best movies, but also has a sublime beauty beneath the surface for those willing to look. There are strong elements of spirituality and honor. Watch the struggle of light and dark with a buddhist twist as you follow the wise monk and his apprentice to a haunted estate, wherein lies a powerful demon and a duo of beautiful ghosts. Morality, deception, temptation, and redemption, in fact just about every sin or virtue is played out in a grand CHK style where monks can fly, and often do in their quest to crush evil. Evil which aparently can manifest itself as anything from an androgynous sorcerer a giant prickly tongue, or even a living breathing mountain. Tsui Hark makes fun movies with strong production values. The lighting and photography are top notch, and the erotic implications of the alluring ghost tempting the monk's naive apprentice tears this movie away from the pack of CHK's mindless (tho' visually appealing) martial arts movies. For all the visual fun, there are mature themes lurking beneath to titilate even the 'substance over style' armchair critics of CHK. The ambient dreamy soundtrack just adds quality depth to what is one of Tsui Hark's best films, and a true classic of modern Hong Kong Cinema.",989366400,4,2313,4.826196473551637
953209,5,6305020892,"I know that many people would disagree, but I have to say that A Chinese Ghost Story III is the best among the Chinese Ghost Story triology. If I had watched CGS part I before I watched this movie, I might have said otherwise. But this was the first movie from the CGS triology that I watched, and I found the part III even superior to the others. The visual effects are superb, background music is absolutely beautiful, actors are well-cast and the costumes are simply splendid! The movie is imbued with a great sense of humor from beginning to the end. The plot, even though a little too similar to the part I, is very well-designed and the fast-paced unfolding of Oriental fantasy would keep any viewers out of breath. The movie still has some flaws though: The personification of a demon by a traditional Chinses building doesn't work well and seems to spoil the movie's potential; and a little too ""animation-like"" visual effects in some of the fighting scenes look childish. Nonetheless this part III is still very successful.  Many people don't seem to appreciate this part III, because of its obvious similarities to the part I. For those who haven't watched any of the Chinese Ghost Story triology, start with this part III and then watch back to part I and II. Any Hong Kong movie fan who watches this movie without any connections to the Part I in mind, he or she will tremendously enjoy this film.",979948800,2,1409,4.613545816733068
7881240,2,6305020892,"This is a very well-done little TV production of Act III of Aida, with traditional costumes and on a well-dressed TV studio stage with (I believe) no audience present.  I sure wish they did opera scenes like this nowadays, they don't.  It is in very clear black and white video, and clear mono sound, very decent for its vintage of 1958.  It even has optional English subtitles (added by the remasterer).

It is very enjoyable, IF you have a video delay box, because the sound is unfortunately off about 90 milliseconds ahead of video.  90?  Hm, I wonder if this was intended as a celebration for Leontyne Price's 90th birthday this year ... if so, it is a horrible gift indeed, both for her and for us.  Actually I am pretty sure it is just due to sloppiness of the classical music video industry, of which VAI is one of the leaders, and it could have been corrected in the lab BEFORE it was released.

Now that I have been toying with the delay box remote a little, I find it is probably more like 80 ms off.  Whatever the exact number is, it sure as heck ain't zero, which it should be.  Funny thing also, this strange disease only seems to infect classical music videos, I have never seen it on regular movie DVDs.  Go figure.

But don't worry, the delay box is only $250, and it's only money, right?  Yeah.  Anyway, with the synch problem fixed, it is, as I say, a very enjoyable little snippet of Aida.

Fast forwarding to 1982, we have Miss Price in a concert performance with Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony.  What can I say about this.  First of all, if there were any visitors from outer space who happened to examine this DVD, they would note no advancement in technology whatsoever in 24 years.  That is unless you wanted to count retrograde motion.  The sound is noticeably WORSE.  There is no more synch problem, but aside from that, the sound SUCKS compared to the earlier recording.  The picture is in color, but is so ugly and murky, again, the B&W show from 1958 is vastly preferable.

OK, how about the performance.  First let me say all the announcements are given in French, with no subtitles.  But at least the text of Miss Price's arias are given subtitles (by the remasterer).

So we get some good nuggets from Cosi Fan Tutte and Ernani.  Then Miss Price takes a break and Dutoit goes into this lengthy, splashy, never-ending orchestral arrangement of Porgy and Bess, complete with banjos.  I suppose the thinking was, since we have a Black artist here, it will honor her, and her people, I guess.  It will make them feel comfortable and welcome.

Now I don't care, and I'm the last person anyone would call politically correct, but I just thought it was too much, way too much.  And I hasten to wonder if at every guest concert she ever did, they had to honor her with a great orchestral arrangement of Porgy and Bess.  And of course, she is so gracious that all she can do is just nod and smile and say thank you for such a great honor, etc.

So maybe I am wrong, and that's OK, I hope I am wrong.  And it was 1982, a long time ago, blah blah blah, although I do happen to remember the year very well, I was already a grown adult ... but never mind.  It was just too long an arrangement (did they leave out ANY tidbit from Porgy and Bess?  And is it their normal repertoire?  Or do they only clean their rooms when Grandma comes to visit, etc. etc. etc.)

I mentioned this to my wife, who happens to be Korean-American.  She thought it was no big deal.  So I said, it is like if you went walking out on stage, and every time, they just happen to start playing 'Arirang'.  Then she suddenly agreed, that is very tacky and annoying!

OK, I admit I have digressed and will wrap up.  I give the DVD two stars, because I am a generous fool, and because I enjoyed the Aida -- ONLY BECAUSE I HAVE THE DELAY BOX.  I am afraid a 90 ms delay or 80 ms delay will irritate most people, even if they don't recognize it immediately for what it is, it will irritate them at a subliminal level.  If the synchronization were fixed -- by the remasterer -- it would be 5 stars (at least for the 1958 Aida portion).

And as for the Dutoit concert, that would earn a single star for its poor picture and sound, never mind the content.

Back on the road, Ning encounters a wandering monk, and the two must join forces to defeat a forest demon that infiltrates their camp. Fate intervenes once again, as the two are apprehended by a roving band of rebels led by Windy, a beautiful warrior that resembles his lost love. This time, Ning is confused for the Elder Chu, owner of the amulet, and asked to lead the group against an evil priest who has sentenced Windy's father to death and put a spell over the entire empire!

Tsui Hark and Ching Siu-Tung return with the next exciting chapter of A CHINESE GHOST STORY! Hark makes every attempt to outdo the incredible special effects from the first film, and succeeds! A CHINESE GHOST STORY 2 puts on a dazzling display of monsters, magic, and martial arts once again. While the plot isn't quite as compelling as the last, it features many favorite characters and more of the same great humor that originally brought them to life. Leslie Cheung and Joey Wang easily resume their chemistry on screen, but newcomer Jacky Cheung quickly steals the spotlight as the Taoist mage Autumn with his lively performance. A CHINESE GHOST STORY 2 is another excellent entry in the fantasy horror saga.

7881246,5,6305020892,"First, I saw and greatly enjoyed the original in a theater in Taiwan in 1987. In fact, I own that DVD and appreciate those great performances of Chang Guo Rong, Wang Ju Shien, and Wu Ma. Still, I was happily surprised to find this new version of the story. In spite of some oddly harsh reviews I've seen elsewhere, it passes muster as a very entertaining film in the spirit of the original. It was a very pleasant surprise to hear the great theme song once again, and the performances in this new interpretation are top notch. Add to that the wonderful and very well done special effects that far exceed in realism those of the original in 1987, and the obvious high quality of this production, and you have yet another very respectable installment in this long lived ""franchise.""  This new version is by far better than the previous two sequels which were so lame that even Chang Guo Rong and Wang Ju Shien couldn't save them. My recommendation: give this film a chance to stand on its own and don't feel compelled to stack it against the original. It's as good as anything else in this genre.",1327795200,3,1094,4.49748743718593
7881247,5,6305020892,"'THE ART OF LEONTYNE PRICE' is a very interesting DVD. It showcases Price's three different stages of development in her artistic aspects.  The 1958 telecast of Act III 'AIDA', here I have to say that is rather disappointing in two aspects: The make up of Price's facial appearance is simply awful, I presume that the Canadian television make up department was still in it's primitive stage, and her stage movement is more like an awkward African low class young girl than a princess.  It's hard to believe that Radames would head over heels fall for a creature like that, nevertheless, her singing of 'O patria mia' and the rest of Act 3 is already of a great Verdian soprano.  The Bonus Selections belongs to 'The Bell Telephone Hour' includes three arias from Il Trovatore, Aida, and La Forza del Destino taped from 1963 to 1967 during which Price was at her peak of artistic achievement. Here leaved it to the hands of the Hollywood make up men, Price had been transformed into a Hollywood glamorous movie queen, elegant movements, and gorgeous gowns.  The two arias from Il trovatore are exquisitely sung, listening to her sing these arias it gives you a feeling that as if there is a magic crystal marble rolling in her throat that enables her to sing whatever and whichever way she like freely and beautifully; the gratification of watching and listening to it is so immense that I don't know how to describe it.  The same level of artistic achievement is equally satisfying for the following two arias.  I would like to note that in the Il trovatore section the gap in the middle of her upper teeth is still there but it dispears in the later two programs. The third part is Price in concert in part of Canada where French is spoken.  Here is the mature Price still in the height of her power, but the agility is somewhat diminished especially in the two arias from Cosi fan tutte and Ernani.
  I for one is a Price devoted fan and I suggest that no Price fan shoud miss this DVD.",1205625600,4,1988,4.561797752808989

I'm piggybacking another rater because I agree.  It was great to see and hear her magnificent voice near the beginning, the middle and near the end.  If only more videos were made of her earlier performances; for example, Aida with Grace Bumbry (I have the vinyl).  Is there a video?

Yes the Cossi Fan Tutti was a little rough but one can still tell the voice was there.  No one is in their best voice always on any song (no matter the age).

The reception she received was magnificent and I wished I could have been part of the French audience.

7881249,5,6305020892,"This 3rd installment of the Chinese Ghost Story franchise is the best of them all. I remember watching this as an adolescent and loving it. Watching the first 2 Chinese Ghost stories can heighten the nostalgia factor when you view this 3rd movie. The score and songs are amazing. The late Wong Jing once again penned the words and Jacky Cheung took on the role of main vocals once again like he did in the 2nd movie (Yun Gan Doe). The title song is a magnificent piece of music that sets up the movie for its stunning visuals and storytelling.

Tony Leung Chiew Wai (Sup Fong) gives one of his best performances as a bratty, naive but good-hearted young monk. His other earlier TVB roles such as Heavenly Sword Dragon Saber and Duke of Mount Deer has prepared him well for this role. Following his master on a pilgramage to deliver a golden buddha, they unfortunately get caught up in a slew of mishaps and events. Joey Wong reprises her role as a different female ghost (Siew chuek or Lotus) this time around and gives and emphatic and determined performance - one of her best ones. Her acting has improved quite a bit from the first installment. She delivers subtle undertones of the anguish in which her former human self has endured but is coy about it. Wong and Leung melded their performances well together. Perhaps their roles provide them with much more dramatic substance this time around than the first 2 movies which the characters displayed less potential in delivering interesting situations (i.e. monk and woman, monk and ghost relations).

Jacky Cheung is quite good with his comedic wit and talent. The 3 actors show great chemistry together with playful banter and some slapstick comedy. Nina Li (Mrs. Jet Li for all you trivia fans) plays a great second string to Joey Wong's character as Butterfly. Her jealousy and determination to claim Sup Fong for herself is convincing and not overdone.

The Hong Kong wirework is topnotch even for its time. Smooth flying sequences with Tony Ching's masterful martial arts direction really heightened the movie to another level. This is not the first time Ching and Leung worked together. They've worked on a few TVB series before filming this film.

The story-telling is superb. With Hark and Szeto behind the helm of the story, they worked out many kinks that plagued the 2nd movie. There were some parts that seemed rushed but it was forgivable considering the rest of the story had wonderful character development and back story.

This film is a must-see even if you're not a big fan of chinese and hong kong cinema. After watching this again after a 10 year hiatus, I still get chills on my back from the final sequence. Cinematography and art direction will make you forget you're even watching a movie as you get submerged into this mythical world of demons, ghosts and magic. I recommend watching the first 2 films to get a much more heightened satisfaction from the 3rd. The payoff is much greater. Trust me.",1156377600,3,2975,4.7466150870406185
