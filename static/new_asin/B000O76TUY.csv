Scenic New Hampshire serves as the novel setting for ""Live Free or Die"" (not to be confused with the later Bruce Willis film, ""Live Free or Die HARD""), an entertaining indie comedy that takes its title from the state's time-honored motto of in-your-face defiance.

John Rudgate - who goes by the nickname ""Rugged"" - is an inept wannabe tough guy who fancies himself a notorious outlaw.  He spends most of his days riding around in a dilapidated van trying to convince others - as well as himself - that he is, indeed, the most feared lawbreaker in the county.  In reality, the ""stolen"" merchandise he is moving is actually his own stuff, and the gun he keeps in a drawer in the kitchen is nothing more than a water pistol.  The folks in town shrug him off as little more than an irritating pest with delusions of criminal grandeur.  Like any villain worth his salt, Rudgate needs to find himself a sycophantic henchman who will do a substantial amount of his dirty work for him.  He alights on Lagrand, a simpleminded, but sweet-natured acquaintance who co-owns a storage facility with his sister, a clear-eyed pragmatist who, unlike her brother, knows a BS-ing con artist when she sees one.

Although the movie can't entirely shake free of the ""oddball quirkiness"" factor that seems to afflict so much of regional filmmaking these days, moviemakers Gregg Kavet and Andy Robin evince a genuine affection for their characters and a sly way with storytelling that go a long way towards mitigating that weakness.  They are aided immeasurably by wonderfully self-effacing performances by Paul Schneider, Michael Rapaport, Zooey Deschanel, and, above all, Aaron Stanford, who, as Rudgate, turns a potentially one-note caricature into an endearingly original and surprisingly memorable comic figure.  And, besides, the colorful New England setting is alone worth the price of a rental.",1190419200,2,1887,5.019230769230769
2791978,4,B000O76TUY,"One bad thing happens after another in ""Live Free or Die,"" a small-budget comedy with echoes of films like ""Palookaville"" and ""Dumb & Dumber."" The protagonist of the film is Rugged (Aaron Stanford), a self-proclaimed Billy the Kid-type guy who runs around his small-town taking the blame for the murder of a man and selling stolen speakers; Truth is, Rugged is a pretty-criminal that is quite obviously not all he makes himself out to be. When Rugged runs into Lagrand (Paul Schneider), a tall and semi-retarted man who co-owns the U-Lock storage center; Rugged tries to get a job as security man. Everything changes when a man messes with Rugged in a bar and Rugged retalliates by poisioning the man's water. After the man dies, Rugged panics and (with Lagrand's help) attempts to dispose of all the evidence linking him to the murder. Meanwhile, a cop (Michael Rappaport) who suspects that his wife is cheating on him looks for Rugged to investigate his role in the sales of stolen speakers around town. Zooey Deschanel (a very talented and underrated young actress) co-stars as Lagrand's sister Cheryl. The only reason I even heard of this film was because of Zooey Deschanel and the only reason I wanted to see it was because she was in it. Even though she's had few lead roles, she's built up an impressive body of work with films like All the Real Girls (this film reunites her with co-star Schneider), Manic, Elf, Mumford, and Winter Passing. Sadly, Deschanel is probably in the film for 10 minutes over the course of the 89-minute film. Schneider, as the clueless Lagrand is a riot. How he did not bust up laughing while reciting his dialogue the way he does is beyond me. He plays the character in a dead-pan, droning way that is hilariously funny. Stanford as Rugged is a decent actor and believable as the character, but he seems like an actor that will be stuck in small-budget roles for a good long portion of his career. ""Live Free or Die"" is not a perfect film and it does have some un-even tone changes throughout, but there are a few solid comic moments and Schneider is a riot. It's worth seeing, but rent before you buy.

2791980,4,B000O76TUY,"This movie is one that would probably grow on a person, and an instant cult following. This movie tells the tale of a small town crook who tries to impart his ways on a few friends, hypeing himself up to be a bigtime criminal, when he actually is still the geeky little high school kid at the clam shack.  This movie has great characters of a sterotyped nature that most people can relate a real life person to, and the roles are played well.  It shows how small things in small towns can grow to legends.  Worth a view, but possibly not a purchase for all.",1186876800,,557,4.235849056603773
2791981,5,B000O76TUY,"I saw this movie, ""Live Free Or Die"" when it first came out, and I loved it. Being a native from New Hampshire, it really meant more to actually see my hometown of Claremont on the big screen. The actors were so funny  and so real in their parts it made you think it was for real. If you have never had the chance to see this on the big screen, and you enjoy a good laugh, then this DVD is a must! The language isn't for the young or some parts of the movie.

8183609,4,B000O76TUY,"John ""Rugged"" Rudgate (Aaron Stanford) is a legend in his own mind. He rips off barcodes on store items to get rebate checks. He buys speakers and pretends they are stolen so he can get a higher price for them. Rudgate thinks of himself as being a bad criminal, when really he is more of a joke. He teams up with ""Special Ed"" Lagrand, a slow witted man who is part owner of a U-Lock-it storage facility. A young bland Zooey Deschanel plays Lagrand's sister. She hasn't found her niche as yet.

The criminal activity escalates through a series of misunderstandings. The movie is lightly comical as we laugh at Rudgate and not with him.

8183610,4,B000O76TUY,"Picked this DVD up at a local store brand new for 5 bucks. I was pleasantly surprised and have already watched it twice. The thing about this movie is we all know of at least one ""Rugged"" Rutgate. This guy has an ego bigger than his parka and watching him getting punked by society in general is hilarious.",1275004800,,306,4.293103448275862
8183611,1,B000O76TUY,"just had to write a quick review to counteract some peoples apparent enthusiasm about this movie. To me it was totally awful, it just didn't work. Tried to capture an Indie type feeling, which i love in films, and maybe the directors are interesting people trying to make a cool alternative style film. However, it just didn't work for me at all - nor the six other people i saw it with. It stands out as a comparison when we happen to see other bad movies together - i saw the movie about a year ago and a couple of weeks ago brought it up in comparisonn to ""the art of war 2"". The art of war 2 won out which really is saying something.",1226880000,,637,4.104
