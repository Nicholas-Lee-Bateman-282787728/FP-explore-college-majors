8472596,1,B000NDIAPQ,"I workout everyday, but needed a new workout routine. So I got this DVD.  I did not feel challenged and was bored.  Mindy is annoying in training.  I think it's her voice.  I spent the extra bucks and got Shaun T's Insanity workout and it is kicking my butt.  I totally recommend buying this.  I'm just a regular person would wanted to firm up her ass and stomach and after 4 days I already see results.  SPEND the money, you won't be sorry!  Insanity workout is NOT for beginners.",1265760000,,481,4.325842696629214
