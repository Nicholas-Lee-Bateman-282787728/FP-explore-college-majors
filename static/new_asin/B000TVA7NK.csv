2910488,5,B000TVA7NK,"The instruction on this dvd is remarkable,  what I have been looking for to help me move through life long patterns of hip tightness, pelvic imbalances. next best thing to taking classes with a wonderful teacher. Not your typical yoga dvd, in a class of it's own. I will be working with this dvd for a long time.",1203811200,5,312,4.379310344827586
2910489,5,B000TVA7NK,"Paula  Tursi demonstrates her yoga program with  variations for  individuals  new to yoga or for those who are at different places in their yoga practice. As individuals,  our bodies are different, and therefore paced differently, and she illustrates that beautifully!
The program begins with a great introduction about working with the body and mind, resistance versus acceptance in a new experience.

Following is the tutorial on the body lesson. Anatomy of the pelvis, spine and hip functions; understanding their movement  to avoid injury and stress during any challenges in exercise.

The breathing segment, this is where the mind meets the body and centers;
 3  options, using mats, blocks, all designed for personal preference while lying on the back, using belly and chest breathing.
The warm up begins with hip and hamstring stretches, great for opening tight muscles where most tensions is accumulated.  Then, up on your feet  and learn to stand properly for simple sun salutations.

The flow series, is gently paced taking you into standing cow and cat poses, warrior  one and two poses, lunges, down dog, plank, cobra.

The balance segment is awesome;  my favorite, for balance is everything for us dancers. This incorporates strength and flexibility while grounding to the earth. Poses includes  balancing on one leg  while stretching  the other, variation of king dancer, chair pose, arms stretches.

The floor segment becomes slightly challenging, again pace yourself. The poses include down dog, split dog, pigeon poses, forward bends, strengthening the spine, rotationing  and opening of the pelvis and strengthening the thighs.

Back bend and Inversion poses segment,  these poses are gentle,  opening the shoulders, chest and flexing the spine using plough pose, shoulder stands, rotating the hips  bridge poses.
 The program concludes with a great rest and deep relaxation which is  a lesson in letting go of all tension, and fleeting thoughts, a journeying into rest and peaceful relaxations by deepening the breath.

The bonus ""go deeper segment"" allows for a deep exploration into yourself using props, such as a mere wall, a rolled mat and of course your breath, a great reminder to leave the comfort zone and try new challenges using pigeon pose, forward bends .

 This program is open to beginners up to intermediate levels, mostly welcoming the beginner. There are no frills or ocean views ; only great benefits in healing body, mind and soul through a  journey into yourself, in your own time, in your own space, and at your own pace.

Great tips on relieving sciatica, creating mobility in the hip joints. This is not a rigorous work out or flow session, it is gentle yoga laid down in basic blocks from which one can attain a realistic personal practice. Loved it!",1201910400,25,2794,5.1128318584070795
2910490,5,B000TVA7NK,"The instruction on this DVD is classic, and so incredibly helpful. It doesn't stray too much from the Hatha yoga I learned from an Indian nun decades ago, in its simplicity and deep health benefits, with the additional advantage of Paula Tursi's knowledge and teaching abilities, which are exceptional, as she makes us understand the ""why"" as well as the ""how.""  You will need 2 small blankets to fold or roll to accommodate yourself and be comfortable in some of the asanas, a strap or thin scarf about 4' long for a leg stretching exercise, and a mat or rug to lie on. Tursi has 2 other people demonstrating with her who are on different levels of accomplishment, so you have a choice of following either one, and it's made clear that you are to acknowledge your own uniqueness and work at your own level.

After the introduction, and a section where Tursi explains (with a skeleton) how important hip mobility is with a few exercises, we get the main instruction, starting with a terrific breathing lesson, which gives us inner clarity and total relaxation. Tursi then gently begins with floor work to increase flexibility and strength, leading up to the basic ""Sun Salutation,"" and going on to much more, slowly increasing in difficulty. The lesson is planned perfectly, with a balance that keeps building without ever causing stress. The final meditation is beautiful, and you can feel your body healing as you relax.

Well produced, the demonstrated movements are always easy to see, the music good, and the meditation visuals a delight, should you want to keep your eyes open. Tursi's soft voice and excellent enunciation makes her instructions easy to follow and pleasant to the ear, and she is aesthetically wonderful to watch. This ""Yoga Inside Out"" DVD is about as good as you will ever find, and with 90 minutes of superb instruction, you really get your money's worth.",1200441600,36,1881,4.8354037267080745
2910491,5,B000TVA7NK,"I really enjoyed this DVD. I loved the anatomical instruction in the
beginning and the ability to follow anyone of the three people who are all
doing useful variations. I am a beginner and it gave me a good place to
start, and then the ability and encouragement to see where I could go.  I
also really appreciated the use of real people in the DVD. It wasn't a super model workout, but one that is realistic and for real people. I also like how it was broken down into sections so when I don't have the time I can just work on Sun Salutes if I want to. There is also a great part for
breathing and meditation that I have used by itself. I would have like the location to be more inspiring, but the teaching was so clear and multi-leveled that I didn't bother me as much.",1199664000,10,770,4.133333333333334
2910492,4,B000TVA7NK,"The quality of instruction on this DVD is outstanding. I have been practicing yoga for 10 years and am often frustrated by the poor quality of the instruction on many yoga DVDs (of which I have tried quite a few). Although it is dubbed a ""beginner-intermediate"" level DVD, it is appropriate for all levels as it is very accurate and encourages an in-depth approach to the practice of yoga. I found the background music a bit tiresome after a while and the setting a bit dull (I like to pretend I'm not in my living room practicing when I'm in my living room practicing!) but otherwise this is a great yoga DVD. I especially like that the sections are clearly separated so you can do whatever you're in the mood for/have time for on that particular day, or go to the instructional sections for more information. Overall an excellent choice for a guided home yoga practice.",1199404800,15,871,4.589743589743589
8211085,4,B000TVA7NK,"I recently discovered this DVD at a used book sale.  As a yoga teacher, I'm always curious about making my classes therapeutic to help benefit my students, and since this DVD--subtitled ""The Healing Way""--specifically mentioned that it helped with lower back, knee, and hip pain, I thought I would give it a try.

I wasn't familiar with the instructor, Paula Tursi, but I read that she holds Masters degrees in both Psychology and Education.  That makes sense, as part of this DVD is educational in nature.  The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:
Introduction
Body Lesson:  The Spine
Program: Breathing Practice - Warm Up - Sun Salutations
Standing Flow:  Balancing - Forward Bending - Back Bending & Inversions - Deep Relaxation - Meditation
Deeper Exploration

In her Intro (4 minutes), Tursi talks about how each body is unique and how she and the background exercisers would be working from different levels during the routine.  I found the Body Lesson to be the most interesting section of this video.  In this segment (10.5 minutes), Tursi focuses on correct positioning of the pelvis.  She uses a student to help her to demonstrate these principles in cat/cat, warrior 2, mountain pose, and warrior 1.

The yoga practice itself is quite long--about 73 minutes--although it is well-chaptered.  It was a decent beginner to low intermediate routine, but Tursi didn't provide the same kind of helpful form information as she did in the lesson part of the DVD.  The practice opens on the floor with belly breathing, reclined leg stretch series, cat/cow, and down dog.  From mountain pose, Tursi moves into sun breaths and lunge salutations, adding warrior 1.  The standing flow includes warrior 1, warrior 2, side angle, peaceful warrior, humble warrior, and wide angle standing twist.  This is followed by a short sequence of balance postures.  Transitioning to the floor, Tursi performs down dog, down dog split, full forward bend, bound angle, head-to-knee pose, and seated heart opener.  The back bends/inversions include bridge with an optional plow pose/shoulderstand and then fish pose.  The shavasana is quite short for such a lengthy practice (about 3 minutes), and Tursi talks the entire time.  The meditation was also quite short at about 3 minutes.

I also liked the Deep Exploration.  In this section, Tursi uses a student to show what I would call ""tricks"" or assists for accessing some of the poses more easily.  Unfortunately, it moves VERY quickly!  In about 4.5 minutes, all of the following postures are covered, with Tursi providing voiceover instruction:  wide legged forward bend, shoulderstand 1, shoulderstand 2, tree, and pigeon.

In the end, I would say that this DVD includes some instruction gems but that the yoga practice itself is very average.  I'll hang on to this DVD for now as I work to internalize some of what Tursi teaches, but I don't see keeping it in the long run.",1478390400,3,2943,5.014432989690722
8211086,1,B000TVA7NK,"My wife got this. Here is her feedback : ""I plan to explore whether or not I can return this DVD. I bought it to help with chronic pain related to a bulging disc in my lower back. I tried it out, watching the instructional video in full beforehand. I did not find her explanation on how my body works to be thorough or helpful enough, and she seemed to take it for granted that everyone watching would already know the names of all of the poses. The moves went too quickly from one host to another, and the worst part was that they actually caused pain. For example, I don't know anyone living with lower back pain that could truly start from a full standing position, arms above the head, and bend straight over--repeatedly. I had to stop shortly after beginning because it hurt too much to continue.. I purchased another video at the same time so that I could compare the two, since this one and another one were both highly rated by other reviewers. The other one was far superior to this one, so unfortunately I have to recommend to others considering this DVD that they keep on shopping.""",1424217600,2,1093,4.415841584158416
8211087,2,B000TVA7NK,"This DVD is so monotonous- you literally do the same sequence for 30 minutes only adding a single step each time. And then you go back to it after a little break. I can't even.

This DVD is too long- 80 mins of boring is way too much to commit. I would rather practice on my own.

It is not well-narrated; she clearly went back and dubbed it over after doing the practice, and she forgets to give some instructions. So, you have to watch her to know what is actually happening. This is hard when you spend half the time bent over.

Because it is so repetitive, I find that almost every injury I have is aggravated after doing it- my low back and knee, which seriously, this was supposed to be good for; my ankle, wrists, elbows and neck also rebelled.

I suggest viniyoga. This DVD is not the jam.",1424131200,3,797,4.223684210526316
8211088,5,B000TVA7NK,I am a yoga instructor and I LOVE this DVD. I am taking my master yoga teacher training in healing yoga and this DVD is a wonderful compliment to my studies. It even helped me to FEEL some areas in poses that I had not felt before. I really liked the way Paula explains the movement in the body. I definitely recommend watching the section of the dvd on the spine before doing the practice. EXCELLENT yoga DVD. Paula teaches the proper way to do poses and modifications if needed so most can enjoy this practice comfortably.,1308700800,5,524,4.412371134020619
8211089,5,B000TVA7NK,"This DVD focuses on the lower back, hip and knee.  It is appropriate for beginners and intermediates.  If you are a beginner, I would recommend watching the video from start to end before doing the practice and listen carefully to what she has to say, because she points out variations for beginners and points out posture and safety tips.  Note that you will want to have a strap and a blanket ready before you begin, as well.  An important point that she notes is that you should not be judgmental of where you are but BE where you are in your poses.  I was surprised to find that I felt a difference in my hips after doing this exercise once!  If you feel you need to open your hips, DO try this DVD!  Note that I am not a ""yoga person"", but I am excited about this DVD.",1286582400,4,773,4.1824324324324325
8211090,5,B000TVA7NK,"Very pleased with my purchase.  Someone complained that the footage was too dark.  While the footage is a bit dark, it is not too dark to see what is going on.

The instruction on this is superb.  I like that there are two less flexible, less experienced practitioners that show modifications.

This is a long practice (at least for me it is).  While the focus may be the hips, it provides a full body workout.

This DVD is very helpful with easing my sciatica pain.

Highly recommended!",1264377600,3,487,4.517241379310345
8211091,5,B000TVA7NK,I really enjoyed the poses and the sequence of poses.  This teacher really knows what she is talking about and gives you many ways to get deeper into the poses.  I highly recommend this dvd.,1232928000,,190,4.4
8211092,5,B000TVA7NK,"This dvd is great for all levels because it gives at least 3 variations for each posture. I love dvds like this because it allows people to see that anyone can practice yoga, not just the ultra flexable people.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TAMARA-S-YOGA-FUSION/dp/B001DDY6RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION</a>",1221264000,4,372,7.4772727272727275
8211093,5,B000TVA7NK,Paula is an experienced and knowledgeable teacher. Great instructions and I am motivated to practice as often as I can using this DVD. A great gift to family and friends.,1210032000,,170,4.7
8211094,4,B000TVA7NK,"It is a nice, solid but gentle yoga session with a helpful introduction at the beginning. Why didn't I like it that much? Well, I would have preferred more specific instructions DURING the actual practice, not before it - tips how to hold a specific pose ( how to position my knees, my hips etc. ), what to look for, what mistakes to avoid.. Maybe a quick reminder why a particular pose is good for me.. Without it, it was just another yoga DVD - not bad, but not as great as it could be.",1209945600,13,488,4.147368421052631
