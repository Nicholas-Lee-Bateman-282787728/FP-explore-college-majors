8728982,2,B013W7LSFI,"Really disappointed. This is just a remix of bits from previous seasons. I used to trust National Geographic. Maybe they are hard up for money too. It's just one disc. After watching a few episodes I expected Apollo from season one to show up and tell us season 6 was a big scam but we were all going to get our money back. Also the picture on the jacket shown here is not the same cover that is on the copy of season 6 that bought. S ave your money, just rematch the first 5 seasons.",1481328000,,484,4.052083333333333

8728990,5,B013W7LSFI,"So far I have purchased every season of Brain Games on DVD and they keep getting better! I am a middle school teacher and I show these to my students from time to time. They basically beg me to play them, and I really enjoy them as well. They really make you think and some of the facts really blow all of our minds! I like how when the experts and scientists explain stuff so anyone can understand it, even my 5th graders. Their favorite parts are the illusions and games that they can play along with the DVD. They are a great way to understand the concept and see it in real time. I give Brain Games a HUGE 5 stars!!",1452729600,,619,4.081967213114754
