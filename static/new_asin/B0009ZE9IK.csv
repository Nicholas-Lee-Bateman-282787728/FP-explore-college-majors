8070925,2,B0009ZE9IK,"This anime makes a big deal out of its sexy and playful nature, but it's not like that at all I've found. Sure, there is the occasional breast here or there and sure, there is the occasional hot spring body shot.  But once you get past the fanservice bit, you've got some Shoujo-ass shonen anime, if you catch my drift.

That's right.  Bait-and-switcheroo.

I purchased the first volume of this elsewhere, and thought it started strong before petering out a bit.  Reading online reviews had me skip the supposed uneventful second volume, but I was lead to believe that things ""picked back up considerably"" in the third volume, and boy that review couldn't have been more wrong.

I had to force myself through this volume, and that's from a guy who watched the first volume of GB with a huge perverted grin on his face. Sure, the start of the ""second-half"" of the series was OK, not as good as it was overrated obviously, but I didn't feel like my time was completely wasted here.  But as each episode of this went on, it became more shoujo and more plodding and generally Emo.  Now I'm no huge fan of Emo, but that's where this show goes.

Lots of crying and emotional support.  You looking for something goofy and uplifting like Tenchi or Slayers?  You ain't getting it here!  Lots of Emo baggage from the girl leads.  The main girl, the pink-haired beauty Miharu, becomes background fodder who barely appears in any episode.  Probably cause she's always happy.  The racist White caricatures named Lisa and Kazu (??) get trotted out for comic relief, but are not funny unless ""blue-eyed harpy bitch and rapist perv"" is your idea of funnytime.

So with the move from Harem shonen to Emo shoujo, the audience should also change.  I still treasure Volume 1, but every other volume slowly sees it's studly charm drained and replaced with a good shot of estrogen hormone.  Girls will love the second half of Girls Bravo; its patently soapy and clingy stuff.  Men will be bored to tears at the serious Twilight-style
shenanigans.",1317168000,,2024,4.682719546742209
