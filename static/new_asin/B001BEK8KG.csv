8282822,5,B001BEK8KG,"We saw this on a Christian TV network being used as filler at the top and bottom half of the broadcast hour.  We immediately ordered it.  It is a wonderful video for small children.  It is very bright and colorful on screen, it has delightful animation, and it always has a message for children at the end of each segment, typically two to four minutes.  We recommend this video to anyone who wants to entertain small children while also teaching them some basic life lessons.  Lee and Sherri Sutter.",1350518400,,500,4.573033707865169
