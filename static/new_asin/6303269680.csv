It starts out almost too much like a goofy comedy, but there are sinister tones that begin working their way in pretty soon. Pullman is neurologist Dr Rex Martin, who is contacted by his friend Jim (Bill PaxtonI know, I know, Paxton and Pullman in the same movie together, everybody down a body shot) who works for a corporate conglomerate named Eunice, based I'm sure on the organization Beatrice, whose enigmatic ads ending ""We're Beatrice"" had culture critic Ian Shoales wondering if Beatrice wasn't perhaps some queen and ""therefore entitled to use the royal We"". Anyway, Jim has this mathematician, Halsey, who was working on a crucial formula. Recently he erased the formula's right side and then went home and murdered his wife and children with an ice pick. Jim thinks his old friend and rival Rex might be able to retrieve the equation, also healing Halsey and earning himself great fame and wealth in the process. The operation turns out to be a success, but there's a problem. Halsey's hallucination, the one of a blood-spattered man in a white coat laughing hysterically? Well after the operation it seems to have migrated into Matin's mind. Oh, and when Martin gets home, he finds his wife is sleeping with Jim. And the laughing man kills them with an ice pick. And when Martin wakes up, nothing feels the same.

Martin's mental tampering takes him on a mind-bending journey that will call in to question his very own grasp on reality! BRAIN DEAD comes out of the Roger Corman school of filmmaking, featuring a clever screenplay by ""Twilight Zone"" writer Charles Beaumont. This low-budget brain teaser constantly pulls the rug out from beneath our feet as Martin's altered perceptions of reality begin to twist and turn. Bill Pullman takes us along for the ride as he slips into the mouth of madness, while Bill Paxton is delightfully devious as Eunice head Jim Reston. A crazed Bud Cort also appears as the paranoid Jack Halsey. Adam Simon carefully stages each scene to maintain the mystery as the multi-layered story unfolds. Fans of JACOB'S LADDER, ANGEL HEART, and OPEN YOUR EYES are sure to enjoy this early 90's gem!

619206,4,6303269680,"Brain Dead (Adam Simon, 1990)

When Brain Dead is remembered these days, two decades after its original release, it is remembered mostly for being an early Bill Pullman flick, a few years before he would hit the big time. But this first feature from Adam Simon (The American Nightmare; he also wrote the vastly underrated 2009 flick The Haunting in Connecticut) has much, much more to recommend it than simply another obscure star turn from Pullman, who two years before had been part of what made The Serpent and the Rainbow into one of the best horror flicks Hollywood ever produced. It is oddly common that Hollywood will crank out two movies on the same theme at roughly the same time, with one obscuring the other for whatever reason; think of The Lost Boys getting all the press while Near Dark languished in obscurity. In this case, the overarching film was Jacob's Ladder, which was similarly brilliant but much better marketed. Both are well worth your time, but I'm guessing somewhere along the way you actually saw Jacob's Ladder, while this one fell under your radar.

Plot: Rex Martin (Pullman) is a brain surgeon. His pal Jim Reston (Near Dark's Bill Paxton) is a higher-up muckety-muck on the board of a big corporation. One of said corporation's mathematicians, Jack Halsey (Harold and Maude's Bud Cort, in what may be the best screen turn he ever gave), has gone round the bend and is locked in a mental institution. Reston wants Martin to see if there's any way Halsey can be returned to sanity long enough to complete a big equation he was working on for them. Martin hems and haws, and that's when things get sinister: is Reston suddenly now out to get him, at the direction of the mysterious head of the corporation (George Kennedy)? Seducing his wife (Manhunter's Patricia Charbonneau), getting his funding cut, the works? Or is Martin simply going crazy? Or has he always been crazy?

I haven't even begun to touch on the acting talent assembled for this film; small roles abound for excellent actors like Lee Arenberg (recently part of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise), Kyle Gass, Nicholas Pryor (Ruffian), Brian Brophy (The Shawshank Redemption), Maud Winchester (Birdy), and a host of others. The script is intricate, multi-layered, and ambiguous enough that people are still debating it twenty years after it opened, though if you pause and give it some thought, it's as straightforward as Jacob's Ladder. Simon is a solid director, even in his first effort, and nothing goes horribly wrong here save, arguably, the opening scene (which seems to exist for the sole purpose of putting the ""experimental face"", which was used in promo materials and poster art, into the movie). It's simple: if you're a fan of the mindgame horror film, you're going to love Brain Dead. You probably missed it the first time around; you'll want to rectify that. ****",1294963200,5,2880,4.861507128309572

619245,5,6303269680,"I beleive this ""Braindead"" is actually Peter Jackson's ""Dead-Alive,"" and not the Pullman/Paxton picture. It was rumored for a possible re-release years ago (and has remained in several gorehounds' minds and discussion boards since), and I believe this may be it. Afterall, who really cares about that other movie? I myself have written a few letters and signed a few petitions to get an un-cut Region 1 version of this film. I checked around a few other places, and there aren't any online stores other than amazon that I could find that have this title listed. And until we get a box art image or a plot/cast overview, I guess we'll just have to wait to see what this item really is. The only other site that has this listed is a forum, and it is under the ""rumor"" category--that site being [...].

That being said, if it is the case that this is Jackson's film, my rating is a 4. If it is Jackson's film and un-cut, or at least with special features including deleted scenes, I stand by my original five star rating. If it is anything other than those two options, I give it a one star rating. Yeah that's right. Thank you.",1132790400,,1125,4.461165048543689
619246,5,6303269680,"This has been a favorite of mine for years. It stars Bill Pullman and Bud Cort. I can not even go into deatail explaining this because it is a very hard to explain movie.

It's roughly about a scientist who studied brains for a living and soon becomes the brain that is being studied. Without knowing this the movie goes into super-twist mode. It is definitely a movie that will take a few watches to fully understand. A must see.",1095120000,3,430,4.375
619247,5,6303269680,"Charles Beaumont wrote for the original ""The Twilight Zone"" TV series, and this is more than worthy for people with similar expectations.  Starring Bill Pullman as scientist Rex Martin.  Martin studies brains for a living, but soon finds himself in a bizarre and twisted excursion in his own brain.  Is he working for the Eunice Corporation, or is the Eunice corporation working on him?  The story is hard to explain, and the twists are non-stop.  I had an e-mail conversation with the director, Adam Simon, who reported that Roger Corman called this film his 'art film'.  Similar to the ideas of 'Vanilla Sky', a 'Clockwork Orange', 'Lost Highway' and 'Brazil', this film will not disappoint those looking for a wild ride through the ether of thought.",1045526400,7,752,4.928571428571429
619248,3,6303269680,"This movie makes the point that everyone's experience of ""reality"" is based upon the functioning of the brain.  Mess with the brain, and reality changes.  Perception of reality can easily be altered through brain injury, electric stimulation, drugs, etc.
For the length of the movie, we experience life through the eyes of a scientist played by Bill Pullman, who may be the victim of insanity, a brain injury, the manipulations of a supernatural figure or an evil corporation, etc. (you cannot be sure which until the end of the movie), and who may or may not have killed his family.  Reality is constantly changing for him and no matter how real things may appear to be, it may all turn out to be an illusion at any second.  Despite how disorienting this may be, the plot is very coherent and has a sense of continuity to it, and you feel as if the characters are moving towards a goal or some sort of resolution, unlike with many surreal films.
Written by Charles Beaumont, one of the most frequent scripters for the Twilight Zone, this movie is like an extended episode of the show (which often dealt with characters suddenly finding themselves fallen out of normal life and into a disorienting situation).  Unfortunately, as interesting as the ride is, the ending (which is merely o.k.) left me feeling cheated.  If it were a half-hour show, this would be more bearable, but you expect more after sitting through a feature-length movie.
It is a well-made, well-acted film worth watching at least once, maybe twice, but knowing the ending spoils it.",1018483200,10,1552,4.772388059701493
619249,4,6303269680,"Director Adam Simon once made a fascinating documentary about director Sam Fuller, and BRAIN DEAD can be read as his homage to Fuller's SHOCK CORRIDOR, since much of the plot has to do with who is and isn't insane, and what is and isn't reality.
Bill Pullman and Bill Paxton -- admit it, you've always gotten them confused -- co-star in this low-budget gem that was barely released to theaters, but now gets a decent DVD release.  The sound and picture are just fine -- alas, producer Roger Corman takes his trademark cheapness even to DVD: there are no commentaries, no extra features save some bios and a few trailers, and there's not even a booklet inside the case!
In any event, this is a smart and suspenseful little movie, and one you'll enjoy trying to piece together long after it's over.",970444800,13,796,4.605633802816901

7842846,3,6303269680,"This is an early Roger Corman film featuring a young Bill Pullman (The Serpent and the Rainbow) and Bill Paxton (Aliens). Bill Pullman plays eccentric brain surgeon, Rex Martin who is experimenting with brain re-sculpting techniques. The company he works for wants to use these methods to change people's personalities... for profit, of course. The clinics will be called 'New You'. They will provide a way to rid people of unpleasant memories of childhood, failed romances, unsuccessful career moves or any other traumatic experiences that haunt their everyday life.
Rex Martin is reluctant to sign on to the project, but is gradually coerced into it. What results is a hallucinatory trip into madness for Martin (very similar to Pullman's role in 'The Serpent and the Rainbow'). Is he wielding the surgeon's knife... or is he the one under the knife? All will be revealed at the movies end. Until then, you just have to keep guessing.
Liked the movie the first time I saw it, but not quite as much when I later bought the DVD. Not sure why. It's still a good movie though. Not great maybe... but pretty good.",1428796800,,1110,4.816753926701571
7842847,4,6303269680,"Perhaps the most interesting thing about this film is that it was produced by Julie CormanYESas in, married Roger Corman, who was a master of grade-B Hollywood movies, and has been memorialized in his own film biography, Corman.
Julie produced much more family-friendly films than Roger, and this is perhaps as close as she gets to the grade-B horror which tended to be Rogers hallmark.

The film was re-released in 2005 on DVD.  It stars Bill Pullman (also in Independence Day and Wyatt Earp) and Bill Paxton (Titanic, Apollo 13, Weird Science) as well as Bud Cort as one of the supporting actors, who has been in innumerable films in a 40 year career.

I guess youd have to call this a sci-fi horror film, although like any good horror film it is low on blood and body parts and heavy on suspense and atmosphere.  Clearly it should qualify as grade B, as the special effects and sets did not look very expensive, but I think she did an excellent job with the resources she had.

Its hard to say much about the plot without ruining it, but I will note that the jacket compares it to Sixth Sense, which it predated.  I would also compare it to Sutter Island which it also predated, and say that the plot is every bit as suspenseful as both those films produced at much larger expense.

In this case the main character is a researcher on the relationship between brain pathology and mental disorders named Rex Martin (Pullman) whose research is being funded by a mega-corporation, here dubbed Eunice.  He thinks he has localized the cause of paranoia to a particular region of cerebral cortex, and that perhaps by ablating the area of disturbance, it would be possible to cure paranoia.  He then becomes pressured by a corporate executive, played by Paxton, to skip the years of animal and tentative human trials and immediately test his hypothesis on an unfortunate deranged man in a mental hospital, because it would be politically and financially convenient to Eunice Corp. to either cure the man sufficiently enough to retrieve vital data he had calculated, or failing that, at least make sure that hes never able to release the information to a competitor.

Martin/Pullman visits the unfortunate patient in the mental hospital, and thereafter things become increasingly confused.  He seems to be hallucinating himself after visiting the patient.  Is this part of a conspiracy by the corporation?  Was part of the patients paranoia the truth?  Is Martin actually the patient, or has he become another patient, or is there another explanation?  Its easy to dismiss the film as fairly cheesy sci-fi which is now almost 25 years old, but the plot still has the ability to cast a spell if you give it the chance.",1418688000,,2711,4.762820512820513
