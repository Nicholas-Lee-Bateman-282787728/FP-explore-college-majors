8615761,1,B00FH4RL8I,Too depressing to watch all the way through - more 3rd person narratives if they can really stand up for themselves. Special Olympics has a better reputation and for good reason,1482710400,,177,4.741935483870968

8615765,5,B00FH4RL8I,I saw this on an airplane and was amazing at how good it was. I decided to buy a copy for my mom to show at her ladies get together club and church get together. We need more of these feel good documentaries. The girls in this film have so much stacked against them and yet they find joy in just having the opportunity to participate. There is no one winner - they all are winners.  Such a cute film. Really don't miss this one. It makes you realize the inner beauty of the human race and how one lady could change so many girl's lives - at least for a day.  Tear jerker so have your Kleenex near by.,1395532800,,600,3.9916666666666667
