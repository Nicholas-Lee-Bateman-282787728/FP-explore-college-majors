5028301,4,B006X08FGW,"These movies are not really comparable.  'Goodfellas' continues Scorcese's fascination with the underworld and that milieu's tensions, rivalries and secrets generate great tension and fear.  Mann's 'Heat' on the other hand revolves around the near symbiotic relationship of a cop and a criminal.  They even have a meal together at Kate Mantolini's!  A feeling of doom hangs over both these 'professionals'.",1371859200,2,406,5.60655737704918
5028302,5,B006X08FGW,Absolutely no problem with the disc or its packaging. Have never had a problem with any of the previous owned films I've purchasedf through Amazom.,1366329600,,147,4.92
5028303,4,B006X08FGW,"So as i stated before i will see if this movie was only 'half' of goodfellas. It's not. It's the entire films, however it does require you to flip the disc just like 'Schindler's list' does.  It doesn't require you to start it however, just FLIP the movie and two seconds later it starts on it's own.  The flip i think  happens around after one of the 'bosses' was killed in the bar by Joe P. lol I for me it's cool because the movie is good regardless. But please just know you will have to flip the cd over at one point. after that, it plays all the way through and nothing else is required.",1358121600,,593,4.094827586206897
5028304,2,B006X08FGW,"I bought this dvd set at Wal-Mart for $10.00 and was extremely dissapointed at the ""GoodFellas"" dvd. First off, the movie transfer was just awful. Very grainy & gritty picture plus the audio was not great. To make things worse there are no special features other than a recommended movie page and a theatrical trailer. (To be fair, this did not really bother me too much as I was not interested in special features. I just wanted the movie.) But the very worst thing about this dvd to me is that the movie is CUT IN HALF with the first part of the movie playing on one side of the disc and the rest of the movie on the reverse side of the disc. That's right, you heard me! This is a freakin' TWO SIDED DISC!!! TWO SIDED DISC!!! TWO SIDED DISC!!? What the heck kind of stone-age sh*t is that!!? That sort of thing just irritates me! This is 2012, man!  A movie that is 2 hours and 26 minutes long should be able to fit on one side of a friggin' dvd. What the cheese is up with this two-sided disc crap!?  I mean come on! ""GoodFellas"" was a friggin' Oscar nominee!  It deserved a much better dvd treatment than this!

I have never seen the movie ""Heat"" and as of right now I have not viewed the dvd of it included in this set. (I only bought this set for ""GoodFellas"".)

Anyway, if you are looking for ""GoodFellas"" on dvd I recommend you buy the 2 disc edition because it has a better transfer and the whole movie on one side of the disc.

Also I would stay away from the 1 disc edition of ""GoodFellas"" because I am pretty sure it is the same crappy dvd sold in this set. I hope that this review helped you. Have a good day and happy shopping.",1342224000,13,1641,4.144654088050315

5028366,2,B006X08FGW,"While I've not watched ""Heat"", I purchased this set because of ""Goodfellas"". This is a movie that when it premiered in 1990 when I moved to Atlanta, I  went to the neighborhood theatre and watched it TWICE because of the total experience. It's been on TV, censored, dubbed and undubbed. But, I wanted my partner to experience what I experienced in the theatre now that we have a wide screen TV worthy of the theatrical presentation. Well... back in the 70's, thanks to ""A Star is Born"", I became a die-hard Barbra Streisand fan. And as a result, I purchased (from a cut-out bin) her Christmas Album. On it, from a song whose title escapes me, she said that something made her ""up-sot"", rather than than upset. Ever since the day I heard her say that I've used the term ""up-sot"" as a method of saying just how utterly disappointed I was with something. Distributor, with this version of ""Goodfellas""... I was ""up-sot""!!! With all due respect to the magnificent director and cast, the film, for the quality of the acting, direction and script was equal to my 1990 experience, to the distributor:  (1) Why in the name of all things bright and beautiful could you NOT put the entire movie on one side of the DVD? The last time I had to ""flip: the disc over was back in the 80's when I rented a video disc player and chose Al Pacino's s""Scarface""; the movies were larger than a 33 RPM album! I've since purchased the DVD - one side only!!! Secondly, the audio was terrible. I went to the menu to see if there was an alternate audio track when the film's character commentary dialog was louder than the primary dialog and you couldn't find a happy median. But. moreover, correct me if I'm wrong... but one of the main reason's I purchased this movie for my partner, was to support my view that  watching ""Goodfellas"" will make you CRAVE ITALIAN FOOD, because of the delicious footage. It seems like that was trimmed, because I know what I saw, and it seemed I saw less. Ironically, after I ordered this 2 for 1 set, I found the same offered in a cut out bin in a local Best Buy. (Same price) If you have seen ""Goodfellas"" and want to have the same experience, you may want to invest to extra bucks to get your plate full.",1414368000,,2215,4.424019607843137
