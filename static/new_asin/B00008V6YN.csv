7987130,5,B00008V6YN,"A group of soldiers, including a nurse, make their way, alone, through the North African desert in WWII. The movie follows their trials and tribulations and their uncovering of a spy in their midst. Eventually they make it to Alexandria where they have a bar scene that ended a chain of Holsten Pils adverts based on old movies. Carlsberg simply played the bar scene from this movie and Holsten Pils wisely quit the field.",1523145600,,422,4.716216216216216
7987131,4,B00008V6YN,"I bought a VHS tape under the alternative title Desert Attack, reported by the Amazon seller to be in NTSC format compatible with U.S. VCRs. It was the last one available on Amazon, although two remain for sale at higher prices on Amazon Canada, under the Desert Attack title. The Amazon Canada VHS offerings depict pictorially, rather than the VHS cassette cover, a poster with the original British movie title Ice Cold in Alex, which is a much better title once one has watched the movie and understands the phrase's significance. Anyway, the VHS tape when it arrived was titled Ice Cold in Alex, not Desert Attack, and had a picture of a shirtless John Mills holding a pickaxe, with a barbed wire insignia underneath, against an olive background. From the cassette box cover contents, there was no indication that it was in fact NTSC format. The cover referenced Warner Home Video UK, suggesting it might instead be PAL format. I was only disheartened momentarily, however, because the label on the cassette inside the box and cover referenced BFS Video Productions in Richmond Hill, Canada, and said ""Printed in Canada."" Whereupon it turned out to not only a Canadian-import 1999/2000 VHS release in NTSC format, but the best VHS cassette qualitatively that I've ever rented or bought. Meaning, a VCR pause froze the movie frame with DVD-like clarity rather than the usual VHS-like slight blurriness. So I was extremely pleased with the VHS cassette and purchase, and then the movie was highly entertaining also. This needs very much to come out, under the Ice Cold in Alex title, on regular commercial NTSC format DVD, for Americans to be able to see. I don't know my British WWII movies very well, other than obviously The Bridge on the River Kwai, but this one is very much up there, high in that genre's rankings. Apparently, from the ads preceding the start of the film, there was a series of British PAL-format VHS and/or DVD movies with the same barbed wire insignia and olive background on the cover.",1483920000,,2012,4.834782608695652
7987132,5,B00008V6YN,Fantastic movie. The characters are complex and the edition also had a lovely interview with one of the actors. And the epic beer in the end... well worth waiting for.,1439683200,,167,4.6

7987134,5,B00008V6YN,"This is one of my husband's favorite movies of all time,.so I searched high and low to find it for him.  Be aware this is PAL version so you will have to change the region on your DVD player.",1394150400,,191,3.8974358974358974
7987135,4,B00008V6YN,This was a great DVD. I last viewed the film as a teenager in the late 1950's with valuable moral lesson.,1373068800,,105,4.0476190476190474
7987136,4,B00008V6YN,"This is an excellent WW2 war movie set in the Western Desert of North Africa. It is the story of a group of British soldiers who must outwit the German Army and survive the desert in an attempt to return to British lines. One of the party is a German officer who is eventually found out. To survive the desert they all must pull together. Upon arrival in Egypt they have ""An Ice Cold"" beer ""In ALEX"" (Alexandria, Egypt). CAUTION....will not play on USA players....hopefully it will be released in NTSC and Region 1 format in the near future. It is a very good film of desert survival and honor between enemies.....also released under the title ""ICE COLD IN ALEX""...",1154217600,4,665,4.55
7987137,1,B00008V6YN,"Watch out. This product is NOT COMPATIBLE with north american

dvd players. It is ONLY suitable for region 2.

Even if it is advertised on a north american website (U.S/CANADA),some not so bright individual ""forgot"" to have it encoded for region 1 for export purposes.

You will waste time and money and end up with a useless product

unable to enjoy it,and in this case also review it.

All you will get is a ERROR display on your dvd player.

Hopefully some day this otherwise fine war movie will be available locally in region 1  format,then maybe i'll be able to review it.",1149552000,2,577,4.543689320388349
7987138,4,B00008V6YN,Saw this movie only once but remember it rather vividly.  It is a classic film of man vs. nature set in Northern Africa during the Second World War.  The struggle between man and nature is epic and the acting is done in the classic british style of the 1950's.  On the lines of Alec Guinness and the like.  Nevertheless one waits for the classic ending scene.  Unfortunately watching this movie in the US would be a struggle for anyone who is not dedicated.  Kudos for anyone who actually reads this review.,1145404800,23,507,4.516483516483516
