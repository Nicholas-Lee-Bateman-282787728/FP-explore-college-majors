Buy the official concert in Seoul, not this one because the quality is very disappointing.",1386633600,,248,4.413043478260869
8520568,1,B007PMPGE6,"Compared to Super Show 2 and 3 this is a huge disappointment. For the high price I paid, I couldn't believe the poor quality. Dis 2 was blurry from beginning to end. Unlike the other 2 sets from SME, this seems to be a 3rd party production of blurry little clips put together with no photo book, subtitle or proper sequence of the concert. It is not a full concert version but rather just a mish- mash. The Discs have rough edges and makes noise in my DVD player.

I'm surprised SME would agree to such a product to be sold globally, not in sync with their usually superior quality of products. Worst thing is that I am not able to return it seeing how bad it is.",1374883200,2,663,4.1796875
8520569,4,B007PMPGE6,"After having seen a number of Super Junior's ""You Tube"" videos, I became a convert to their music,
and despite not understanding Korean (or one of the other languages they might be singing in), I really
found I preferred the music to anything else. That's what I thought the DVD set would be:  the entire covering of the
""Super Show"" concert, however, there is a considerable amount of ""ad lib"" style interviews with the group's
members and the quality of the product really wasn't as polished as anticipated.

Aside from the fact that it wasn't exactly what I expected, I enjoyed it and will definitely watch it a few more times.",1362441600,2,630,4.666666666666667
