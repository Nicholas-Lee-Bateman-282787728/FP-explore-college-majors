If you ask somebody in Latin America who its most famous comedian is, it is possible that they may answer Cantinflas. On the other hand, if you ask somebody in Mexico who its most famous comedian is, it is an absolute given that they will say Cantinflas. And the truth is that Fortino Mario Alfonso Moreno Reyes (1911-1993) - Cantinflas - really left a huge and powerful legacy in Latin American culture, and especially its cinema. ""El Circo"" is one of many gems that we inherited from his amazing and long career.

It is often said that Cantinflas was ""Mexico's answer to Charlie Chaplin,"" which sounds accurate. Like Chaplin, Cantinflas' characters were based on good-hearted champions of the underprivileged. His clothing and appearance in general were similar to that of Chaplin's tramp. However, contrary to Chaplin, who was huge in silent films, Cantinflas' success was in the talkies, because he developed a very particular way of talking and expressing ideas that nobody could copy and has become a tradition in Mexican culture. And, as Chaplin, Cantinflas didn't get the girl at the end - at least in many, if not most of the times. That is precisely the case and part of the story in ""El Circo"" (The Circus), in which Cantinflas plays a cobbler. One day, the circus comes to town and he gets attracted to one of its female stars. Eventually, he joins the circus just to be close to her, and, as you can imagine, he does the funniest things to gain her attention. However, one loan shark is planning to steal the circus from its good-natured owner, because he can't pay the mortgage. It turns out that Cantinflas may be at the right place and at the right time to save the day.

If you know about Chaplin's films, you may remember that he did ""The Circus"" in 1928. It is not hard to imagine that Cantinflas wanted to follow the same route with his own version of such a fascinating story. And he succeeded in doing so. Not in vain Chaplin once said that Cantinflas was the greatest comedian alive. Whether or not that statement is true, depends on the viewer. But Cantinflas is definitely a must for any movie aficionado. (Mexico, 1942, B&W, 93 min.) NOTE: In addition to ""El Circo"", Sony Pictures is also releasing ""A Volar Joven,"" ""El Gendarme desconocido,"" ""El Mago,"" El Senor Fotgrafo,"" ""Los Tres Mosqueteros,"" and ""Si Yo fuera Diputado."" Furthermore, Sony is also re-releasing such classics as ""El Bolero de Raquel,"" ""El Analfabeto,"" ""El Padrecito,"" and ""Su Excelencia.""
