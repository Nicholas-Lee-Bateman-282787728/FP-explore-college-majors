8635534,5,B00HSOP98Y,"The information was good and would be generally helpful if someone is rebuilding a trailer.  Not as much detail as I thought might be given, but overall I am happy with the DVD's.  Quite a few advertisement for assorted RV products that he used as part of the trailer rebuild, it was good to learn about what is available for enhancing the enjoyment of camping.  He gave great tips for the big class A motorhomes as well.  I would recommend this to anyone thinking about taking on the job of rebuilding a trailer, it will give you a idea of how much work is involved.  But at the end of your work you'll have a unique trailer to enjoy and have pride in having done it yourself.",1440892800,,677,4.299212598425197
8635535,3,B00HSOP98Y,Very educational but the first two disks were the exact same episode and the quality of the DVDs is not the greatest. One of mine had what looks like a burn mark on the DVD?? It did not work. the episodes that did work were great!,1437436800,,230,4.021739130434782
8635536,4,B00HSOP98Y,"All the information provided was excellent, but if you are looking for information on restoring a vintage camper, rather than renovating with all modern products then keep looking. Some of the upgrades are ones I think a lot of people would do, such as the addition of the low voltage/battery system for boondocking, but some of the others push pretty far from the vintage camper aesthetic. Roof-mounted A/C, microwave oven, flat screen TV with DVD and surround sound are examples, plus replacing all the cabinets with ones removed from modern RVs. Mr. Polk does acknowledge early in the project that essentially turning this into a modern trailer is what he's going to end up doing, and the completeness of the renovation/upgrades will allow people to pick and choose the safety and other updates they want to follow. I'd have appreciated some side info on actual restoration and restoration resources, but that's why we have the Vintage Trailer Talk forum :)",1417305600,2,960,5.00625
