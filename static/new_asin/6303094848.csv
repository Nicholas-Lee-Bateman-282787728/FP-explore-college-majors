556749,2,6303094848,I found the excercises a bit too repetitive and in the end rather painful in the back. Workout time for legs is rather short. Overall workout time is only 35 minutes since a lot of time is lost for commercials.,919728000,3,210,4.275
556808,4,6303094848,"This tape is still good though a little dated. The excercises aren't dated though. I do prefer the first section and I rewind for the double aerobics,which gives you quite a bit of squatting and leg pressing. For floor work,there are probably better tapes out there. Still LaReine is a good role model and she is pleasant and not annoying like many instructors. It is not really total body,but there is only so much you can do in 45 minutes.",1118966400,,441,4.525
556809,4,6303094848,"I've been buying a number of The Firm tapes, and this is one of my favorites.  After warmup and stretching, there's a 10 minute cardio section involving a step.  You are cued when to rewind if you want a longer cardio section.  The hips and things sculpting involved weights and different positioning, and is great.  I wished the ab workout was a little more varied in the type of exercise involved, and it didn't involve any weights.
This is a great tape for days when you want to focus on sculpting specific areas.",1061251200,2,516,4.516129032258065
556810,5,6303094848,"This is among my top three favorite Firm tapes. I know some have indicated that they don't like the instructor LaReine, but I have no problem with her. She's very calm and gives clear instructions. If you want a great lower body workout, this tape will definitely give it to you and in less than an hour a session.
  My other top favorites include The Firm Total Body Low Impact Aerobics tape (number 1 in my book). Janet Jones Gretzky, makes it enjoyable, yet challenging at the same time and you work up a serious sweat. But don't be fooled by the notion that this is a ""low impact"" tape. IT IS NOT!
  Number 2 -- in fact, almost in a tie for first place on my list --  is the first Firm tape ever starring Susan Harris.  You'll barely remember your name when you're done 65 minutes later . But your body will look -- and feel -- great.",1035590400,9,838,4.20625
556811,4,6303094848,"I really love this one...It's not too long (40-45min) is a great leg/hips workout with the box and the ab segment is the hardest one I have ever done...This is not a beginner workout and you must have a box...The box segments are difficult although will produce results, I really like the instructor, she is no BS and explains things well...And did I mention that the ab workout at the end is fantastic?? Again do not attempt this tape if you are a beginner.",992822400,2,458,4.464285714285714
556812,4,6303094848,"This is a great video, but it obviously has some film cuts in it.  For example, what is it with the shoes off, ankle weights on in 5 seconds?  I always have to pause the tape or take my shoes off a few minutes before the standing section ends to avoid falling behind.  They also do a lot of other things they could not possibly do without cutting the film.  They should at least not make it so obvious. Otherwise, this is a good workout.  I highly recommend it.",991008000,,461,4.134831460674158
556813,5,6303094848,"I really love the fact that this tape targets the problem areas (abs, hips, and thighs). Every section is really good. The floor work for the legs is GREAT! The best part of the workout is the abs. My sis really loves the ab workout. This is the ab workout that she usually likes to do on ""Five Day Abs""!",977961600,5,304,4.083333333333333
556814,5,6303094848,"As with all the Firm Classic tapes, this is one tough workout!
I previewed this tape before I attempted to do it and thought ""that doesn't look so hard.""  Boy was I wrong.  Aside from a the warm-up, which has a waltzy feel to it, the moves are very strait forward and easy to follow, but that doesn't mean that you don't get a GREAT workout!
The first time I did this tape, I quickly discovered that this tape is designed to take those legs and abs to their very limits.  The abs section of this tape is an increadible workout in itself.  The floor work for the legs is KILLER and this tape has a section of tall box work that is great for lifting those buns.  You even get a pretty good delt workout for shaping those sholders during the low impact section (which can be rewound and run twice if you feel the need for more cardio).  Not bad for one workout video!
The really great thing about this tape is that it can be sectioned off and used as two shorter workouts instead of one long workout.  Just drop out the low impact part or the floor legs part on anyday and do the rest of the tape.  Or you can rewind part of the low impact section and create a super long leg burning workout.  It's a very versitile tape that has quickly become one of my favorites.
Weights and a tall box are required for this tape, as is a lower step box, but your abs and buns will never look better or burn more!",973641600,25,1396,4.121771217712177
556815,5,6303094848,"This workout grows on you, at first I didn't like it too much:  dated outfits, dated ""crotch shots"" and some seductive directions from the instructor, LaReine Chabut.  However, for those interested in aerobic  weight training, this tape is great for a quick workout that focuses on the  lowerbody.  It consists of a warm-up and cool down, aerobic training (12 or  22 minutes - you can rewind the tape), floorwork for the abs (9min.),  hips/thighs (15min.).  Keep in mind, there is little upperbody, but I  rotate this tape with The FIRM's UpperBody, so it all evens out.  This tape  is not difficult for the serious intermediate or advanced fitness guru, but  with weight additions that are higher than what is suggested, the upperbody  can be worked.  The lowerbody still feels a little neglected, but it is  great for a ""not so tough day.""  I have to say, this tape is a  classic - with the good stuff and the bad stuff.  This is a fantastic tape.  YOU WILL NEED: a 4""-10"" classic step, a 12""-14"" high  step (for the thighs - and I just use a rubbermaid stool), dumbbells, and  optional ankle weights.",957398400,16,1103,4.640625
556816,5,6303094848,"My title says it all!  If you are going to purchase a video, this is it!  Look no further.  It covers everything.  And if you hate to run in place or stand through your whole workout...never fear most of this video  is done on the floor.  Dont get me wrong its still not easy but definetly  effective.  In 10 days YOU WILL see results. The other FIRM Total body  workouts are good but this one is the BEST!  Enjoy!",953510400,3,414,4.1265822784810124
556817,4,6303094848,"I have exercised using the Firm videos for 4 years.  I started with Vol. 1 and added Vol. 4 after 3 months of serious workouts.  A year later a girlfriend found out about my home workout schedule and asked if she could  join.  She seemed discouraged as she, an advanced exerciser, could not  perform the moves on the tape quickly or efficiently.  So to show her that  I too looked uncoordinated when learning a new tape, I purchased this one.  She saw that this tape was challenging to both of us.  It soon became our  most difficult leg workout! The Firm is improving their own advertising of  the SIMPLE exercise equipment needed to GET RESULTS.  Because the box  doesn't say all the items needed, I always preview a new video before my  first workout to know what equipment is needed and moves to expect.  This a  excellent video to strengthen legs, abs and your heart if the rewind  function is used.  As always, I encourage all purchasers of The Firm to get  a copy of their tape ""20 Questions About Fitness"" to help  encourage and educate them about weight training.",926553600,,1072,4.542105263157895

7837003,1,6303094848,"I really knew within 5 minutes of doing this that I would hate it but since I spent $ on it I plodded through. I really hated the step portion,as it seemed so awkward and clumsy to be going up&down while trying to lift the weights-felt like an accident waiting to happen. I also find,after 25 plus years of doing at home workouts,that repetitions on the high step tend to bulk my lower half rather then slim it. I also felt that the floor work in this could not compare to the excellent floor work in Volume 1 with Susan Harris. I happen to love Volumes 1 and 3. Volume 4 is good also-I just skip the step and do squats and lunges. For excellent lower body toning,I highly recommend Tonique Premier and Tonique Mat by Sylwia Weissenberg.

7837005,3,6303094848,I've used the FIRM tapes for years.  I have 5 of the original workouts and use them each day of the week.  I did not have this one so I thought I would order it to have the set and 6 days of the FIRM workouts.  I did not like this tape.  It has dance moves that are slow and make me feel like I'm wasting my time.  I stopped using it shortly after I got it.  The other 5 are still great and continue to use them.,1388016000,2,412,3.625

7837008,4,6303094848,"I have been a long time fan of the Firm, but out of the classic Firms I only owned Volume 1.  Now that many of the Classic Firms are being remastered to DVD, I decided to try out a few others.  One of them was Volume 5.

I am pleased with this workout.  I was not entirely sure that I would like it but I do.  For one it's a little shorter (45 minutes) which is nice, though you do have the option to make it longer by doing the aerobics section twice.  I think it's complete enough on it's own.  The focus is Abs, Buns and Thighs which are my definite problems areas.

You start out with 4 limb aerobics using the short box.  I personally like this because it keeps it low impact which is what I prefer.  A lot of the Firm Classic workout have high impact aerobic segments, which I don't care for.  I modify them to suit my needs however which works well for me.  By using light dumbells for the aerobics, your arms get a bit of a workout as well.  There is some other upper body workout but overall it is shortchanged a bit because the emphasis of this workout is abs and lower body.

In addition to the step aerobics, you will see some toning work for the lower body using a tall box.  A couple sets of leg presses with a set of squats in between.  There are 2 sets of 12 leg presses for each leg, which makes it a little shorter set but they are done back to back so it still packs a punch.

Then you move to the floor for abs and lower body work.  Abs are worked for 9 minutes which is a nice lengthy set.  The lower body is covered well here too, you will see inner and outer thigh work, plus bridge and table work.  I like that the classics include floor work.  While squats and lunges are effective, I get tired of standing work.  The floor work mixes it up a little and still hits the lower body nicely.

I have heard an assortment of commentary on the lead, LaReine Chabut.  Some feel she is phony and plays to the camera.  I didn't find that to be the case, I liked her quite well as a lead.  She has a very nice physique as well, she appears to be strong and healthy looking.  Overall, I think she did a nice job.

I would give this one 4 and a half stars.  It is probably the least popular of the Firm classics, I like it due to the emphasis and the shorter length is a plus.  The other Classics are fine workouts no doubt, but an hour gets to be a little long for me personally.

Overall, thumbs up from me!",1356393600,,2421,4.012578616352202
7837009,5,6303094848,"I loved this workout and I have all of the Classic Firm videos Vol 1-6.  Most I could find on DVD, except this one, vol 5.  I wish I could find it on DVD...cinnamangirl@yahoo.com",1297555200,,178,4.205882352941177
7837010,5,6303094848,"This workout never grows old or gets boring. The classic Firm workouts are one of my favorite workout series. Of course Lareine Chabut is a tough instructor but she is totally cool instructer and gets straight to the point as she leads you through work on the 8 to 10 inch aerobic steo and the 12 to 17 inch tall sculpting bench and then down to the floor for a super set of leg work using dumbells and ankle weights of course there is a killer 9 minute abdominal part and the floor work burns the glutes. This workout is 45 or 57 minutes. The video contains a 12 minute aerobic section using light weight and both steps-the aerobic step and tall step,but it has a thing were if you want a 20 minute aerobic workout routine before going down the floor to do the floor work you can see the timer on the screen were you can rewind the 12 minute aerobic section if you want over 20 minutes of aerobics. I think it is a great workout as is without even doing the rewind process. There are alot of you out there who will love this workout going through it from beginning to end. I use my Firm 8 inch box during the great easy to follow but ultra hard core step aerobics and then I use my 12 inch tall step during the leg press part using 5 to 8 pounds on my should but of course I am a short athlete and all you guys and gals out there might want to use heavier weights and use taller boxes then what I use,but it is easy for beginners to start because variable weights make it for a beginner or ultra tough for adavanced exerciser. Anyone can try this workout trust me you will love it. If you can`t complete the workout or any classic firm workouts just do what you can and fast forword you know skip to the cool down,but remember you never stop suddenly while you are doing aerobics you must walk around the room till you heart rate and with this workout or any other workout from the classic Firm collection or any workout,make sure you check your pulse. And always workout to the good healthy burn of exercise not to the bad grueling pain of injury. And please with this video workout remember to start carefully and not try prove anything that you can not do yet,you will wake and feel like you have been hit by a truck,of course you are going to feel some pain after you do your first challenge workouts like this great Firm workout with Lareine Chabut,it take about 2 to 3 weeks to break out of extreme pain sorness,believe me I had to go through it,but don`t give up,don`t ,ake it a failure start slowly and progress up and you will start feeling great and strong as well. This is one of my favorite workouts of all time,This is a complete classic by the firm,trust me you will love,you will love the 8 to 10 inch aerobic box and the 12 to 17 inch muscle shaping step. You will love the super abdominal set,the push ups and the the great hip leg and thigh floor work followed by a great cool down stretch using the Firm`s popular towel stretch that is perfect for anybody`s different flexibility. So get ready to sweat with the Firm`s ABS,HIPS and thighs sculpting. You will love it.",1287532800,,3087,4.26962457337884
7837011,5,6303094848,"I love this and ""The Firm: Sculpted Buns, Hips, and Thighs"", they have effective exercises to target the thighs and hips, and the workout isn't too long.  I also like how these are ""floor leg"" workouts, meaning they don't involve any standing/jumping/squatting/lunging for the days when my knees or feet are too tired from work.

By the way, I would recommend these two videos above the newer ""Body Sculpting - Fast & Firm Series"" Hips, Thighs, and Abs"" video.",1162339200,,460,4.810126582278481
