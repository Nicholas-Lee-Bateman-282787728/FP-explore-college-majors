They didn't have cable and they always said really sounds interesting that they would look into it. . .well, I couldn't wait so I purchased it for her and her hubby. . .GUESS WHAT, they like the series so much they ended up getting DIRECT TV so they can see it up there in the mighty Rockies. . .So I'd say GREAT PURCHASE, changed some minds out there!",1371686400,,417,4.085365853658536

3781114,3,B001RUEDKA,"""MonsterQuest"" is a TV show produced by History Channel, trying to take a ""scientific"" angle on various urban legends and ghost stories, usually from the United States.

With this third season, the quest goes off rails as the team ransacks the New York sewage system looking for alligators (they only find roaches), or sends out a posse to find the...wait for it...Jersey Devil - in broad day light, no less. ""Snowbeast Slaughter"" looked promising, but according to the perennial sceptics on the web, the episode might actually be a gigantic hoax?!

The real nose dive, pun intended, comes in the episode about the Black Demon, a gigantic man-eating shark hiding out in Baja California. The team does manage to establish contact with a shark of truly enormous proportions, only to find that it's a completely harmless...whale shark.

I was somewhat annoyed by the eye-witnesses who refuse to accept natural explanations to their encounters with ""monsters"", such as the lady whose car was trashed by a feral dog - apparently, the car was so rusty that pretty much any animal could have chewed it! In her version, a sturdy vehicle was destroyed by a monster (OK, I guess it could have been a rabid St. Bernard).

Am I getting too old for this kind of stuff, or what?

I'm not sure how to rate this DVD (which only includes 8 of the 25 episodes of Season Three), but since I don't want my rusty persona to be mauled by the Abominable MonsterQuest Fan Monster, I give it the OK rating. Three stars.

Running for cover...

3781115,3,B001RUEDKA,"I don't have to write a long and elaborate review, plenty of people have already done so. I'll be brief: MonsterQuest is one of the most interesting T.V. show ever produced. If you are interested in Cryptozoology or the Paranormal then buy this DVD Set, you won't regret it. In my opinion this show is a must add to any DVD collection.

So the show is great....but sadly this Set contains only 8 episodes of Season 3, and to my knowledge the History channel decided not to release the other episodes on DVD. It seems like they wanted to release this Season in three different DVD Sets, and for reasons not known to us they decided not to produce Set number 2 and Set number 3. I still recommend this DVD Set because all 8 investigations are very interesting, but it's disappointing to know that the other 17 episodes of Season 3 will never be released on DVD. Or at least it won't be released anytime soon.

Here are the 8 episodes you'll find on this 2-Disc Set:
- DISC 1 (approx 188 min): Death of Loch Ness / Cattle Killers / Swamp Stalker / Devils In New Jersey
- DISC 2 (approx 188 min): Gators in the Sewers / Snowbeast Slaughter / Mega Jaws / Monster Close Encounters / Bonus

1. Death of Loch Ness : A review of researcher Robert Rhines' claim that Nessie, if it existed, may now in fact be dead and its corpse is lying somewhere at the bottom of Loch Ness.
2. Cattle Killers : An investigation into the unexplained mutilations of livestock in North America which are found drained of blood and with surgically precise wounds that do not match known predators.
3. Swamp Stalker : A trek into the swamps around Fouke, Arkansas following skilled trackers in search of a nocturnal, Bigfoot-like creature said to be responsible for violent attacks. The case inspired the 1972 documentary movie The Legend of Boggy Creek.
4. Devils in New Jersey : A 60-person research team delves into the Pine Barrens of New Jersey in search of the legendary Jersey Devil, a horse-headed, bat-winged creature reportedly haunting the area for the past 250 years.
5. Gators in the Sewers : A look back at a story from the 1930s that a swarm of alligators was found living in the sewers under New York City, and a new delve into the sewer system to see if the creatures could still be lurking there.
6. Snowbeast Slaughter : A hike into the Rocky Mountains in search of a Bigfoot-like creature that local ranchers believe is responsible for killing livestock and elk, and a look at fresh kills near Pikes Peak that could lead to the animal.
7. Mega Jaws : A search off Mexico's Baja Peninsula for a reported 60-foot shark of possible prehistoric origin that terrified local fisherman call the ""Black Demon.""
8. Monster Close Encounters : A look at some of the most compelling eyewitness accounts of close encounters with Bigfoot, from Minnesota to Washington state, witnesses are interviewed and evidence is tested to find out what people are seeing in the forests.",1349740800,5,2950,4.59392789373814
3781116,5,B001RUEDKA,"This DVD set is a definite must-have for any fans of Cryptozoology, myths, legends, or monsters. I've been trying to slowly get the entire series, so finding this set for such a good price was great for me. Enjoy!",1329177600,,213,4.487179487179487
3781117,5,B001RUEDKA,"This is my faverite series of all this catogory of shows. Yes they don't find things all the time,,,but sometimes they do find a lot of interesting things. Either way it's awesome to watch. BUT..WHERE IS THE LAST PART OF THIS SEASON ??? We're all still waiting. Now this made my day,( for more information check out Loren Coleman's website [...] ) good news for fans of Monster Quest. There is a season four. It will air on Wed. Jan. 13th,2010 a special 2 hour show. Thank you so much History channel. Please release part two for our collection. And keep them coming for us the fans.",1262390400,11,583,4.457943925233645
3781118,2,B001RUEDKA,"As with many of these shows, the first season started out pretty well.  Frankly, they are exhausting potential topics for the format.  The format, by the way, is about 40 minutes of suspense and less than 10 minutes of no answers.  To make things worse, The History Channel/A&E are releasing only one half of a season this time (""Season 3, Volume 1"").  They apparently have noted CBS/Paramount's marketing practice of DVD releasing. Half season sets cost the buyer more in the long run and generate more revenues.  Watch these shows on TV and save your money.  You probably won't watch them repeatedly anyway.",1247356800,21,609,4.864077669902913

For anyone who enjoys the mysteries behind Bigfoot, Loch Ness, Ghosts, and other mysteries, this is a must have series.

3781136,4,B001RUEDKA,"I love this series and the paranormal/cryptozoology in general, so I was excited about ordering these new episodes. My excitement has been tempered. It doesn't have the excitement of season 1 and nothing amazing like the snowy lake cabin episodes (i believe that's season 1 and 2). Just not enough tangible evidence to get me excited about these quests so far. New Jersey Devil has been the highlight so far, though. Exciting reenactments on that episode.",1422316800,,455,5.0

3781139,4,B001RUEDKA,"And it kind of sucked that there were only a few episodes.  We watched it really quickly.  It seems like they were kind of getting out of good things to investigate.  I was really disappointed that we didn't see any shark for the giant jaws one.  I think I'm going to buy Season 1.  Hopefully, there will be more to see.

8338924,4,B001RUEDKA,"Its a really entertaining show. I enjoy watching it in the evenings after I get home from work.

Some of the episodes are very interesting and really make you think what can be out there. It does have some really boring filler episodes, like the feral dogs in Detroit...I wouldn't exactly classify that as a mystery or as ""monsters"". But overall it is a great and entertaining series.",1505520000,,384,4.647058823529412

8338929,5,B001RUEDKA,"Excellent series investigating the paranormal creatures and events that plague our planet. It is a true crying shame that History Channel canceled this incredible series. I will now leave myself open to haters with my next comment. To all the skeptics out there Bigfoot and or Sasquatch IS real. Always remember it is so easy to simply deify the existence of anything and everything. It takes no work and elicits zero backlash from the public at large. However having the courage to take a stand and not only believe that something is out there, but to study and research it takes true courage.",1482364800,,594,4.776699029126213
8338930,4,B001RUEDKA,"If you are interested in cryptozoology, Monster Quest continues to be one of the better programs ever devoted to the subject.  This last final release of a few episodes is good and worth having if you're interested in the subject matter.  However, as many other people who have reviewed this collection of the last of the ""Monster Quest"" DVD's have pointed out...This is the last set of episodes released; at least in the United States.  Under the title ""The Complete Season Four"" of ""Monster Quest"", which was released in Europe, they include the rest of Season Three and all of Season Four.  Unfortunately; these are not from the right ""region"" to play on U.S. DVD players.  So unless you can get your hands on one of those, you're out of luck.  I have a used set I purchased that I've never been able to watch (One day...).
Monster Quest was a fairly well done series - Especially compared to some of the ridiculous shows that are on today - It's too bad that the History Channel decided not to release these episodes in the United States.  There are some great episodes in the unreleased collection and they don't rerun them much at all.  You figure they made them; so why not try and make a little money off of them?  There are so relatively few decent shows regarding cryptozoology.  Periodically, I check to see if they've finally released them.  Nope.  Same with ""Bigfootville"", one of the better documentaries out there that's never been released on DVD - Although it shows up at least once a year being rerun on some channel.",1478390400,6,1535,4.623616236162362

8338932,4,B001RUEDKA,"I always have had an interest in all things weird, and Monsterquest fit the bill. The show was interesting in that often it would pose more questions than would actually answer. It was one of the best in its genre. ""Swamp Stalker""  was filmed in my area, and gets my thumbs up as the best episode. It is a shame that the rest of season three and all of four were never released on DVD, but I believe that direct downloading makes more money and is less trouble than DVDs ( my theory ). Good delivery time and service from the seller.",1468281600,,533,4.2254901960784315
