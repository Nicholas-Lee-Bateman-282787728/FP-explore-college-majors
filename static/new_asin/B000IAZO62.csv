2654183,5,B000IAZO62,"There have been several books written about ""the Santo Tomas experience"" over the years since WWII, but it takes a video portrayal of the conditions to enable most of us to understand just how bad conditions became towards the end of 1944 and up to liberation on February 3, 1945. Amazon also stocks Cleo Mathews Wetmore's *Beyond Pearl Harbor* that I think comes the closest to helping one to understand. Another title that one should read might be Teedie Cowie Woodcock's *Behind the Sawali* (remember in the DVD the repeated references to Sawali, a plant material used to screen the huts and main gate from prying eyes). Other titles are *One Hundred Candles* and *Living with Post-traumatic Stress*. Amazon usually stocks all of these for those of us who want to learn more about this small corner of WWII.",1196380800,3,810,4.83453237410072
2654184,5,B000IAZO62,"This film brought back a flood of memories.  I was born in Manila, and my family and I were in Manila during the Japanese occupation.  My dad was imprisoned in Santo Tomas for three years during WW11. We left Manila in July of 1945 and I was 15.  That was an experience my family and I will never forget. I am glad to be able to have a recorded history of that period of my life. Many thanks to Kawayan Production,Lou Gopal and Michelle Bunn.",1183334400,6,442,4.176470588235294
2654185,3,B000IAZO62,I was looking for some documentary material regarding WWII (Pacific).  This was good information but a little boring in the presentation.,1173312000,2,137,5.523809523809524
2654186,5,B000IAZO62,"This is the best information I have seen on the civilian prisoners of war in the Philippines. Everyone who was there or had friends or family there should see this. In addition, anyone who is interested in history will find this excellent. Thanks to Lou Gopal.",1160438400,2,260,4.673913043478261
2654187,5,B000IAZO62,"This is a wonderful accounting of the American citizens (and others) during WWII when the Philippines were taken over by the Japanese.  Most were taken from a tranquil and priviledged lifestyle to one of deprivation and uncertainty as they struggle to survive while waiting for their rescue by the American Military.  Some didn't live to see that day, but luckily for us there are others who survived and share their stories in this documentary.  I encourage those who wish to learn more about WWII to watch this DVD because to most this was a previously untold and unknown part of history.",1160006400,8,590,4.821782178217822
8144602,5,B000IAZO62,Great presentation of the life of the internees under Japanese occupation.  The cinematography and blending with interviews was as professional as a Hollywood or 60 Minutes production.,1520899200,,184,5.814814814814815
8144603,5,B000IAZO62,I was really hoping to see my grandparents who were interned at Santo Tomas. I didn't see them but I heard many interesting stories and learned more about what my grandparents went through.,1483488000,,189,4.757575757575758
8144604,5,B000IAZO62,"Moving documentary. A good book to complement this movie would be ""Outside The Walls"" by Gladys Savary, Library  of Congress catalog card number 54-8336. It was a private printing in 1954 and might be hard to get but worth reading if you are able to find a copy. Gladys was an American woman married to a frenchman when the Japanese invaded the Philippines. Because of that, the Japanese considered her French even though her husband went back to fight in the underground.

My parents lived in Manila before WWII. They came back to the states on vacation in January 1941 and were not allowed to return by the State Department. After the war, my father did go back with General MacArthur to assess the damage. My father stayed in Gladys' boarding house and ate all his meals with her.

The story is taken from her diary and memory and is very moving for those who are interested in knowing what went on during that horrible time in Manila.",1449878400,,938,4.571428571428571

8144606,1,B000IAZO62,Anyone who enjoys real life and death stories of the war in the Pacific would enjoy this movie.,1434585600,,95,4.333333333333333
8144607,3,B000IAZO62,"Very interesting, but then it concens my farher who was incarcerated in Santo Tomas University, so my rview is subjective.",1424736000,,122,5.15
8144608,5,B000IAZO62,"My mother, grandmother, aunt, and uncle were all captured from the Philippines and brought to the Santo Tomas Internment Camp. My mother has described the horrible conditions that she had to live though there as a child. My grandmother used to lay on the cold ground to let my mother lay on her back so that my mother wouldn't get too cold.

I bought this for my mother to watch and she kept nodding and agreeing with the entire documentary. It even included some stories that my mother had told me previously (Roll out the barrel! Christmas is coming today or tomorrow!).

A must watch for anyone who had been in a POW camp, or knows of anyone who has.",1407542400,,653,4.433333333333334
8144609,3,B000IAZO62,I purchased these as a result of my interest in the internment camp of Santo Tomas in the Philippines - it would be better if they did a documentary on that camp. There is a significant amount of literature on Santo Tomas and should not be hard to get into a documentary - or a film!,1374192000,,283,4.071428571428571
8144610,4,B000IAZO62,"I bought this product because my great uncle was held the camp.  It was a very interesting, moving documentary.  It was a little slow in parts, but gave a good idea of what the people and times were like there.",1220659200,3,210,4.225
8144611,5,B000IAZO62,"My mother, father, grandparents, and sister were in Santo Tomas and this film mimics what I was told growing up. A sad experience for me watching this now that my parents and grand parents are gone.",1202515200,,198,4.527777777777778
