5730642,2,B00CMQUQTU,"This was never going to be more than a high 3 maybe low 4 stars from me. Its typical of the beach flims of the 1960's. The plot is lame and dated, the dramatic conflict is contrived, and seriously; the transformation of overly intellectual bookworm to a cool kid blue performing hottie is inexplicable and unexplained. The DVD quality is really bad, washed out, sound is muddy. It's hard to watch.

Honestly, the only reason to by this is to have a more complete collection of Raquel Welch films.",1430352000,2,496,4.573033707865169
5730643,3,B00CMQUQTU,"I really wanted to like this movie, really.  However, unless you are a Raquel Welch fan and want to see her in her early 20's before her big break and her memorable dialogue (ugh, ugh) in 1,000,000 million years BC than this is the movie for you.

The plot is a rehash of so many movie plots from the days of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland (lets put on a show), but it is still enjoyable.  In this movie's case, the gang had summer jobs at Lake Arrowhead and in route learned that the jobs were canceled.  So they take it upon themselves to open their own teen dance hall, which is where the music comes in, including Gary Lewis and the playboys as their house band.

Music and bad dialogue ensues

It was great to see Gary Lewis and the Playboys on film, however, they do not play anything that is recognizable as a hit.  And it looks like the Shrimp Shack Five (from That Thing You Do) took inspiration from the band members of how to perform in their ""beach scene.""  The band members in their beginning musical number stood and moved back and forth without moving their hands on their instruments when they were suppose to be playing, still this doesn't take away from the film, because who looks for realism in a movie like this?

It was nice to see the 65 gold mustang convertible in the movie, and I mention this because with so many Ford's and so many mention of Coke and the small budget the filmmakers had it would be easy to suggest that instead of product placement, these two companies had a major hand in producing this film.

But the best part is Raquel Welch, while not really starring was prominent in the movie.  She plays a psychology nerd who is after a boyfriend, the best part of the movie is during the last ten fifteen minutes when she sings, and dances shedding her nerdy persona.

If Raquel is the best part of the movie, the worst part has to be the transferring of this movie to DVD.  Despite all the warnings about the age of the film and the image quality, it looks like it was recorded to VHS then to DVD.  The picture was out of focus and didn't quite fit on the screen.  I know this type of movie will probably never get the digital treatment (so many moves so little time), so be forewarned and this is why it got three stars.  While the movies is mindless enough to watch again and again and to torcher the grandkids with for my enjoyment, the picture quality takes away the enjoyment for me.

The question remains, is the movie worth the money it takes to own it.  Unless you're a Raquel fanatic, no, but I doubt you will find this in your local redbox or streaming video either, so the choice is yours.",1422316800,3,2638,4.316430020283976

5730647,5,B00CMQUQTU,"For those who grew up in Lake Arrowhead, CA and remember the dances at the old pavilion, this film will delight you.  Seeing the Righteous Brothers before they were famous was a real treat.  Thoroughly enjoyable if you liked Beach Baby Bingo and films of that genre.",1405382400,2,266,4.638297872340425
5730648,3,B00CMQUQTU,"I've been waiting to see this old gem for a while now, primarily because it is one of Raquel Welch's first films, and knowing that it was a beach movie, meant only one thing; Raquel in a bikini! In that regard this movie delivers everything promised. Not only do you get Raquel in a bikini, but you get Raquel doing one of the hottest dance numbers I've seen for this era. Feminine loveliness can also be found in the delectable Quinn O'Hara and Mary Mitchel, as well as sexy Lori Williams (Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!) dancing away in the background. As for story and acting, I won't go there. Let's just say that the acting in this film, makes the Frankie and Annette films look Oscar worthy. The copy is not remastered, but looks to be made from a video print, however the quality is good to very good. As a Raquel Welch and beach babe film aficionado, it's well worth adding to your collection.",1404432000,3,899,4.454545454545454
5730649,4,B00CMQUQTU,"Glad to see this one finally available on DVD.  It, however, is a DVD-R dubbing from a pan and scan VHS original but I am not carping.  Raquel Welch in her first movie (and she gets to sing a song also!).",1403222400,3,204,3.951219512195122

8583553,2,B00CMQUQTU,"Boat chases,Karate fight, Robbers being chases with teki torches in broad daylight. There is some blonde hair guy that looks familiar that the camera stays on for some dance scene. Your regular teen party movie in love-fight-back in love. I remember watching this on late night back in the seventies, it looked better back then, the picture quality is below terrible. The Rightous Brothers perform Justine at the end of movie. Gary Lewis and the Playboys perform a lot of songs all musical. The other groups in the movie perform your wanna be a Beach Boy songs. Raquel gets on stage and performs to show the guy she is chasing, she is much more than a brain. Most of the movie she is reading books. She has one scene in a bikini that lasts all of 15 seconds. This is the type of movie while you are watching it you say to yourself why did I buy this.",1499212800,,850,4.386075949367089
