6249244,5,B00I462XJS,"In a stroke of luck, my copy of Ranma 1/2 Set  2 arrived in the mail almost two weeks in advance of street date. While I love using Amazon in general, there are simply better places to order Anime and Manga if you're looking to get your merchandise ahead of time. I've taken a series of photos of the set, but I can't post them here yet as there doesn't seem to be an option to share user photos ahead of release.

However I CAN write an advanced review, so let's get right to it, shall we?

As I've stated in my previous reviews, I'm a huge fan of Ranma 1/2. When I first discovered it, I consumed as much of it as I could possibly get my hands on. Trouble is, the mid-to-late 1990s were not a time in which you could get your hands on full TV box sets, so I typically ended up watching scattered episodes from across the series with little rhyme or reason. Whatever Blockbuster Video or Hastings had in stock is what I watched. I never knew with any certainty what I might find when I went to the video store, but one thing I do know is that some of my favorite episodes were to be found on tapes with the subtitles ""Anything Goes Martial Arts"" and ""Hard Battle"".

Ranma 1/2 Set 2 is comprised largely of ""Anything Goes Martial Arts"" (season 2) episodes, with a sprinkling of ""Hard Battle"" (season 3) thrown in for good measure. This is both awesome and sad news: while some of my favorite episodes were shown during the ""Hard Battle"" season, the episodes on offer in this set don't quite make it to the ones I enjoy the most (my very favorite episode of Ranma 1/2 will appear on Set 3... more on that in September when the set is released).

The first thing I should point out is that while Ranma 1/2 is notorious for filler material, that doesn't really start to affect the show until a little later in the game. While there are filler subplots sprinkled throughout, the first and second seasons are fairly light on 100% filler episodes. With that in mind, I've listed the episodes included in this box set, tagging filler episodes where appropriate:

Episode 24: This Ol' Gal's the Leader of the Amazon Tribe
Episode 25: Behold! The 'Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire' Technique
Episode 26: Enter Mousse! The Fist of the White Swan
Episode 27: Cool Runnings! The Race of the Snowmen
Episode 28: Ranma Trains on Mt. Terror
Episode 29: The Breaking Point!? Ryoga's Great Revenge
Episode 30: Danger at the Tendo Dojo!
Episode 31: The Abduction of Akane!
Episode 32: Ranma vs. Mousse! To Lose is To Win
Episode 33: Enter Happosai, the Lustful Lecher!
Episode 34: Assault on the Girls' Locker Room
Episode 35: Kuno's House of Gadgets! Guests Check In But They Don't Check Out (FILLER)
Episode 36: Goodbye Girl-Type (FILLER)
episode 37: It's a Fine Line Between Pleasure and Pain
Episode 38: S.O.S.! The Wrath of Happosai
Episode 39: Kissing is Such Sweet Sorrow! The Taking of Akane's Lips
Episode 40: Bathhouse Battle! We're In Some Hot Water Now
Episode 41: Ranma Gains Yet Another Suitor
Episode 42: Ryoga & Akane: 2-Gether, 4-Ever
Episode 43: Sneeze Me, Squeeze Me, Please Me! Shampoo's Recipe For Disaster
Episode 44: Rub-a-Dub-Dub! There's a Pervert in the Tub
Episode 45: I Love You! My Dear, Dear Ukyo
Episode 46: The Witch Who Loved Me: A Japanese Ghost Story (FILLER)

Just to sum up, the filler on this set comprises 3 episodes. Given how filler-heavy later seasons actually are, this is a surprisingly small number. And while I've never been a person to hate an episode of something simply because it's filler, it's good to see that so much of this set sticks as close as possible to the original source material.

That brings us to the storylines. What few people know is that Ranma 1/2 is actually comprised of two individual shows: Ranma 1/2 ran for 18 episodes before being canceled and retooled into a new series, titled Ranma 1/2: Nettohen. Directors Tomomi Mochizuki and Tsutomu Shibayama were replaced by Koji Sawai and Junji Nishimura, Kenji Kawai was brought in to help write the show's music, and the storylines shifted away from the long-running plots of the first 18 episodes. This means that multiple chapter storylines from the manga were often squeezed down into two episodes or less.

Given the change in format, it's a little surprising that the first storyline on this set runs for four episodes. ""The Full Body Cat Tongue"" arc revolves around Shampoo's grandmother, Cologne, forcing Ranma to remain in his girl-type form for an extended period of time. I gather that this is a typically popular story, but I was never as keen on it as other fans. It seems to drag right around the middle, and of all the storylines that were scrunched down into two or less episodes, I kind of wish it had happened to this one too.

Other notable occurrences in this set: Ryoga learns the breaking point technique, Soun and Genma's martial arts master returns from the grave to wreak havoc on the Tendo household, and Ranma's final mainstay suitor is introduced in the form of Ukyo Kuonji. It's at this point that Ranma 1/2 begins to fall comfortably into its traditional sitcom formula.

I've got to be honest: as much as I love this show in general, I really prefer the format of the original series. I liked the long-running arcs that seemed to build character and storylines. When the show (and manga) eventually switches gears toward the adventure-of-the-week sitcom style, it loses something. The show begins to lack focus and feels like it's meandering around all over the place rather than trying to tell a cohesive narrative.

That said, the humor and heart is still there. These are likeable characters that find themselves in genuinely funny situations. Set 2 avoids the failings of later sets in that the fatiguing repetition of filler has yet to set in. The restored picture quality is every bit as good this time around as it was on set 1, although there are even fewer special features. Aside from clean openings and closings -- still in SD -- ""We Love Ranma"" Part 2 is all we get. It's a nice little feature, but nothing to write home about.

Now we come to the one major bugbear with this set, and the reason I've given it 3 stars as opposed to 5.

For some reason, the decision has been made to hack off the show's opening title sequences. For those keeping score, that means the ""Little Date"" and ""So Many Mem'ries"" opening animation is gone. Each episode still includes the ""Meet Ranma Saotome..."" series explanation animation, and the ending title sequence is unaffected, but there are no opening title sequences. The fact that SD versions are still available to watch in the special features section offers little comfort.

UPDATED: After doing a little digging, a fellow Facebook user has helped me to discern what has happened here. When Ranma 1/2 was released on VHS and DVD, Viz Video made sure to include an opening title sequence on every episode of the show. This was not the case in Japan, however. The ""Little Date"" sequence was only used on episodes 7 through 13 of Ranma 1/2: Nettohen, then beginning with the episode ""Ryoga & Akane: 2-Gether, 4-Ever"", the ""So Many Mem'ries"" sequence was introduced and opening titles became a mainstay once more (although there's some more weirdness with the title sequence much later on. I'll touch on that when the appropriate box set comes out.) So as it turns out, this wasn't a matter of the title sequence being dropped for blu-ray release, but rather a weird instance of a show actually running on TV for multiple, extended periods of time without a proper opening.

Here's how the title sequence situation breaks down on this set: episodes 24 through 27 feature no title sequence, episodes 28 through 31 use ""Little Date"" (the other three episodes using this title sequence are on the first set, having been returned to their original run order), episodes 32 through 41 feature no title sequence, and the rest of the episodes on the set feature ""So Many Mem'ries"".

Yeah, it's a real head-scratcher. But that's how it aired on TV in Japan, so I've modified my score and reaction accordingly.

And now we come to the question of whether or not you should pick this set up. If you're a long term fan or if you enjoyed the first set, then most definitely. My own hangup with the ""no opening title sequence"" issue aside, the content is every bit as fun and heartfelt as that of the first 23 episodes. It's a classic show with a beautiful transfer. Don't pass it up!",1402617600,14,8453,4.642809364548495

They are difficult to read at times, even on large televisions. The eye strain gets very unpleasant very quickly. I really wish Viz would do something about that.",1429401600,2,445,4.6455696202531644

Akira Anniversary: Non-Dub audio sounds awful, video is grainy as hell.  Bad job.
Dragon Ball Z Blue-box release: Looks and sounds incredible, but you may take objection to ""widescreen"" cropping.
Ranma 1/2 Bluray release (This set): Did everything FUNi did with DBZ, but kept original aspect ratio.

If you're a purist, this is definitely the box set to pick up.  It's a bit pricier than DBZ's release, but it's worth every cent.  I will be collecting this in its entirety.  Beautiful package, inside and out!",1419552000,,763,4.8984375
6249257,4,B00I462XJS,"The first Ranma 1/2 Blu-ray set (episodes 1-23) ended with a step forward in the primary relationship between Ranma and Akane. The second set leaves that aside for the most part, focusing on the comedy. Unfortunately, the writers are clearly running out of ideas. Instead of bringing back past favourites such as the figure-skating martial artists and having them square off against Kuno or Ryoga, a considerable portion of this second arc is focused on panty jokes and the perverted old master Happosai. This reeks of laziness, and the wild-goose-chase that permeates close to half a dozen episodes is more dull than entertaining.

One particularly lacklustre episode has the gang visit the Kuno mansion, where they fall prey to all sorts of gadgets and traps that plague the house. This breaks up the pacing and results in the episode being an exercise in mass joke-slinging rather than a few sustained jokes over the course of an episode.

Fortunately, Ryoga and newcomers Ukyo, Cologne, Mousse and Tsubasa add variety without giving the sense of being there simply to up the character count and pad out the show. If recurrent jokes weren't so prevalent, it would be worth five stars. Fortunately, Happosai aside, this is a minor rant. Fans will probably want to omit Happosai's appearances on subsequent viewings.

The extras are almost worth half the cost of this boxset. Not only is a gorgeous laminated card included, but there's an episode guide printed on similarly high quality paper. This also makes it easier to jump past Happosai's appearances the first time round if one is so inclined.",1419206400,3,1600,5.007518796992481

6249264,5,B00I462XJS,"I used to love Ranma 1/2, and it was back in the days when you'd pay $20-25 for three episodes on a VHS tape.  This Blu-Ray collection is a fantastic re-do in a lot of ways.  The original material has been very well cleaned up, you get a LOT more episodes for your dollar (23!), and each flows properly with the opening and ending credits and commercial-break animations still kept in their proper place.

I loved the fact that some short Japanese sequences (opening/closing titles) that were never translated were added in.  Where we used to have to hunt to find dubbed versus subtitled episodes, this Blu-ray collection will not only do English or Japanese, you can also choose if you want subtitles for just the written words, dialogue, or both.  Like any American TV series, you might get a ""clip episode"" or two, but even those are still entertaining to watch.

Since this still isn't enough, you also get a colorful piece of art, printed on card stock (in this set a cute picture of girl-type Ranma and P-Chan) plus a booklet that starts with a ""The story so far"" synopsis, then sums up each episode and also includes a thumbnail image of each.

If you're new to the series, you should begin with Set 1 - it's worth the journey that builds up the story.  This is one of my favorite anime/manga titles of all time and I look forward to continuing to purchase these sets as they come out.",1413676800,2,1392,4.496031746031746

6249277,5,B00I462XJS,"Very very nice set. The blu-ray transfers are beautifully cleaned up, with enhanced colors, and good audio. There are multiple subtitling options to cater to all tastes, and everything is as I remember it. The sets also include a nice book that lists the episodes and gives a summary for each, and includes some samples of the manga.

Also note, with this set, Viz has FINALLY fixed the order of the episodes so they run in the correct order, and are not out of sequence any more (the most glaringly annoying example of which was that in the old sets they use to run the episodes: ""The Abduction of P-Chan"" and ""Close Call! The Dance of Death... On Ice!"" (the ice skating episodes) AFTER they ran ""Enter Shampoo, the Gung-Ho Girl! I Put My Life in Your Hands"" -- which made NO SENSE, because Akane has a flashback in the Shampoo intro-episodes where she remembers events from the ice skating episodes, that HAVEN'T HAPPENED YET, when they were presented in the wrong order.)

Parental Warning: For those in the United States (and elsewhere) still fiercely clinging to ancient Puritanical vices on nudity (but for some reason are perfectly OK with wanton/graphic violence o_O), you should note that there is a fair amount of female non-sexual nudity in this series, especially in the first season. There is a little bit of sexual nudity in the series as well, but usually just in the form of females trying to entice the main character, and not ""bedroom"" scenes.

5 stars for one of the best animes of all time getting the red carpet blu-ray treatment!",1406764800,2,1551,4.694852941176471
6249278,5,B00I462XJS,"Excellent as always if you have the gene for enjoyment. Upon my first watching of this anime i found Season 1 to be by far the best and most enjoyable, with Season 2 not far behind in quality. The more i researched the show i realized this was due to the change in staff/animation quality and the sudden use of filler for practically entire seasons past Season 3. After finishing about 70 episodes i took a break. I began reflecting on why the show suddenly stopped having a continuing plot-line. Suddenly Akane became a sidekick to each weeks cookie cutter episode. I later watched a season or two more and found there were a few filler episodes that were entirely too enjoyable for me to dismiss this show. To my surprised smile i found out they were releasing this show ( that i thought would be lost in history) in high definition in North America. These sets are absolutely gorgeous. The quality is stupendous. The price is tolerable considering they give you slightly more than a seasons worth on each set. I have yet to re-watch this new Set as im still slowly savoring Set 1. But if i recall correctly this is the last season that's not doused mostly in filler, considerably some of the highest quality anime from the 1980's. Filler or no filler i now understand that i must cherish everything Rumiko Takahashi related. I personally find that i enjoy long running anime series from the 1980's and 90's more so than most modern anime. There is a limit to how much Urusei Yatsura, Ranma 1/2 and (dear god possibly my favorite) Maison Ikkoku is in this world, i intend to slowly enjoy all of those stories amidst different mediums. It makes me happy to hear that no matter how these sets sell they will release them all. I will most likely buy all of them, anything to convince to release the other Hi-def remasters of her work in anime.
