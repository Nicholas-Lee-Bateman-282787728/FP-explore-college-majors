In DEAR MR. WONDERFUL, Joe Pesci demonstrates another of his talents: songwriting and singing. It's the story of a small Jewish family headed by Joe, owner of a New Jersey bowling alley/nightclub where he performs regularly. Included in the cast is Frank Vincent, who Pesci pounded wth a car door in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RAGING-BULL/dp/B00062IVKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RAGING BULL</a>&nbsp;(1980).

While bowling balls crash nearby, weirdly-toupeed and mustachioed Ruby Dennis (Pesci) croons to small groups and dreams of playing Chicago or Vegas. His sister Paula (Ludwig) has dreams of her own and moves out of their tiny apartment to pursue them, leaving her teenage son Ray (Handler) in Ruby's care. The boy takes to fencing hot items such as necklaces he steals from old ladies on the street.

Louie (Vincent), a local mob small-timer, tells Ruby that either his place closes or it will get torched. To emphasize the point, videogames and other syndicate-owned items are removed one-by-one, but Ruby still believes he can't be forced out.

Old-time singer Tony Martin and entourage show up unexpectedly at Ruby's place on written invites from nephew Ray. Ruby sings him a new ballad he's just composed, but Martin leaves to go next door and bowl. Totally humiliated, Ruby is unable to finish the song or his set. Deflated and defeated, he isolates himself at Brighton Beach while the fate of a business Ruby lived day and night for hangs in the air.

This West German-made picture (with New York-area exteriors) capitalizes on a leisurely pace by sketching in details of four main characters, including girl singer Sharon (Browning), who is also Ruby's love interest. Pesci plays against his established screen persona of foul-mouthed thug in this portrayal of a religious gentleman who's reticent to let go of lifelong fantasies of fame and fortune. Even after Ruby decides to quit singing at story's close, a chance meeting with an anonymous fan reignites his hopes. Ultimately, ""Mr. Wonderful"" is not about acceptance of the ordinary or status quo, it's an embracing of extraordinary possibilities and a better life.

after 30 minutes the sound and images are not aligned anymore and there is a difference of several seconds between the two. this is very disturbing and makes it difficult to enjoy the movie any further.
i have therefore returned the dvd to amazon and hope they will refund me the money.",1273190400,,375,4.449275362318841

Often, transfers are not of the highest quality. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine (but still watchable), extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer.
