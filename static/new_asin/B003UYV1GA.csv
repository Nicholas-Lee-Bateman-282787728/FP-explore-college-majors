8550077,1,B003UYV1GA,"This DVD was done with little real planning and seems to be missing a great deal.  It abruptly starts with a copy of a painting that is already half done.  There was no intro.  It simply opened with an image of the painting hanging on a wall and the author rambling on about the image he was creating.  As the video progresses he does show the use of sandpaper to work the surface, but completely avoids demonstrating how a single edged razor is used.  Then, as this poorly done video progresses, you'll hear a baby crying in the background.  Not a lot of thought went into this production.  Sight size drawing is mentioned but the image being used to copy from is never shown.  (Perhaps a copyright issue?)  There is discussion of working abstract shapes and flipping the canvas upside down to analyze the progress on the work...but this is never actually done in the demo.  If you are going to talk about an approach that can be demonstrated - do it.  Then in the second portion of this poorly done video, Mr. Van Derven mentions that it is past midnight and he has an appointment at nine in the morning as an excuse to speed up his exit from this project.  This had the potential to be a very good video.  The idea was sound but the execution was absolutely shoddy.",1313020800,2,1268,4.413793103448276
