3558776,5,B001F0TM2G,"I just saw this movie on Lifetime Movie Network. If you like made for television, chick flicks (or dance movies) then you'll enjoy this. It has some well choreographed burlesque dance routines that are really fun. I also like that the dancers are modestly dressed (compared with other films) and still manage to be sexy. A great movie for girls night. Just know, the story is predictable and formulaic. But who cares? It's fun!",1279497600,6,427,4.783783783783784
3558777,5,B001F0TM2G,"This movie was awesome, fast paced, well choreographed, and high energy. A
must see if you like dance, good music.",1251504000,4,114,4.75
3558778,2,B001F0TM2G,"'Make it Happen' is your typical tale of a small town girl named Lauryn(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) with big dreams to leave her job working at her family auto shop and become a dancer in the big city. Of course she gets to the big audition and doesn't merit one of only twenty open spots. Lauryn can't seem to make herself admit defeat, and lucky for her she meets Dana(Tessa Thompson) who not only offers to let her crash at her place, but finds her a job at Ruby's the bar she dances at. Only Lauryn doesn't get a job as a dancer, but as an accountant instead. That is until she gets her big shot when one of the girls can't dance, and she'll have to step up and just make it happen.

There's not much more to say about 'Make it Happen', we've seen this movie so many times before under different names: Center Stage, Coyote Ugly, Step Up, Save the Last Dance ... the list goes on and on. When it comes down to it the acting is fine, nothing exceptional, the same goes for the dancing. There was no specific routine that blew my mind, and no fantastically redeeming qualities to speak of.(Although, I must admit Riley Smith as Lauryn's new boytoy Russ was the one thing that really kept me interested....)

'Make it Happen' is the perfect rainy day movie, grab some popcorn or hot chocolate and enjoy it for what it is, some fun, light fluff.",1240272000,5,1342,4.342629482071713
3558779,4,B001F0TM2G,"I got a chance  to watch this flick and enjoyed it greatly.  It's best described as being in the vein of Save the Last Dance and Coyote Ugly mixed together, in that it has elements of both in it.  This is actually quite interesting as I enjoyed both those, and it felt quite welcome here.

The acting is just right in my opinion, though I'm pretty sure it won't win any oscars or even get nominated.  It's definitely a fun movie though so if you liked Save the Last Dance, and Coyote Ugly, you may just like this movie.",1229817600,8,519,4.202020202020202

3558781,1,B001F0TM2G,"If you put every dance movie in a cannon, got the cannon stoned, then fired it, you'd get this movie. The dancing wasn't that good either. Meh. Rent a Step Up movie.",1453334400,,165,4.1875

3558783,5,B001F0TM2G,"Cute movie about a girl (the gorgeous Mary Elizabeth Winstead) trying to get into an exclusive dance school. She actually dances pretty well. I was surprised by her dancing. If you are a MEW fan, it's a must-have.",1448841600,,213,4.631578947368421
3558784,5,B001F0TM2G,"I love ""Make it Happen"" its a great movie if you love dancing.  If not, the plot is still good but it is definitely more like a ""Step up"" type of movie.",1448150400,,152,3.75

3558788,3,B001F0TM2G,"It has a predictable story line but like most dance movies you watch this for the dancing. The dancing was interesting, a cross between hip hop, ballet, and burlesque. For the lead they made her character development (self assurance) be portrayed through her dance and wardrobe. Over all it was an enjoyable movie",1439856000,,313,4.9245283018867925
3558789,4,B001F0TM2G,"Pretty good and worth watching, though not my favorite dance movie.  I had a hard time feeling the romance on this one or fully connecting with the characters.  The plot was pretty interesting and I did enjoy the dance moves.",1439078400,,225,4.6

3558814,2,B001F0TM2G,"As a fan of almost every dance movie ever made, it pains me to rate this one so low, but I feel I must warn others from spending money on this flop.  I now know that not every dance movie is worthy of purchase.  The acting is so bad it was painful to watch.  The minimal talent featured in the dancing ability could in no way begin to make up for wasting my time.  This was an overall general disappointment.",1412121600,2,408,4.0625

3558824,2,B001F0TM2G,"The story isn't so great, and definitely not original; a combination of Coyote Ugly and Save the Last Dance. The few burlesque performances are fun and too short. Not sure why they kept it so tame. Ending is too obvious.",1315872000,,220,4.525
