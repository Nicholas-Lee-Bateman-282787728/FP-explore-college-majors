7878498,5,6304860463,"This is a circuit workout routine with an Arabic flavor.  You begin with 20 minutes of aerobics, move on to 20 minutes of weight lifting, then finish with 15 minutes of yoga/stretch.  Afterward, the ladies show you a few moves of their own, including how to relax before a performance.  These ladies prove you don't have to have a ""gut"" to be a bellydancer!",1109808000,3,357,4.546875
7878499,3,6304860463,"After seeing a couple of rave reviews on this video from some other dancers, I bought it. It is pretty good, but not exactly what I expected. The aerobic routine is pretty standard, except the three dancers are using  Arabic music rather than disco beat. Each of the dancers does a variation -  low impact, a little more bounce, and then a high impact version of the  same move, so you can pick how much jumping around you want to do.
The  weight section is good to learn a few different exercises to help with  troublesome arm sag, and simply strengthen for better veil work, and there  is an abs section with some pretty standard crunch-style exercises. On any  given exercise there are only 8 repetitions, however, so if you want to do  more than one set (which I think you would have to do to get the results  these women have achieved - they're in great shape) you need to stop the  tape. Also, for some reason, they pause in between the exercises to show a  similar exercise you could do at the gym. This, to me, wasn't necessary,  since if you go to a gym you need someone (a trainer) to help you with the  exercise the first couple of times to make sure you're doing it correctly.  Instead of stopping, I wish they had used this time to do another set of  the exercises on the tape or alternate with a variation.
The Yoga section  is pretty good, the positions demonstrated are not impossible for  beginners, so this is a good introduction to a few stretches and relaxation  techniques as well as some good breathing exercises to calm the spirit.  The last part of the tape showcases the three dancers as they perform.  Although I loved all their costumes, the last dancer is by far the best  dancer of the three, IMO. Rooshana is simply marvelous! She does a great  sword routine where she demonstrates her spectacular abdominal control.  Best of all, she really listened to her music and it was fun to see her  interact with the audience.
Overall, not a bad tape, but it could have  been better. The first reviewer was right, though - the skits are funny.  Just don't expect a heavy workout with this one.",962841600,21,2115,4.456919060052219
