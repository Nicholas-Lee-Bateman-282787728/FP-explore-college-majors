7820827,5,6302053668,This Winnie The Pooh series holds a very special place in my heart.  As a kid I watched Winnie The Pooh a lot.  I'm now a 29 year old man and I still love Pooh and his friends.  I remember my mother bought me this VHS years ago and I watched the crap out of it.  I wish Disney would release every episode of this series on DVD.  I would buy all of them.  VHS is a bit out of style nowadays.,1391212800,2,390,3.6951219512195124
