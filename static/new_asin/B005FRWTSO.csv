4685121,5,B005FRWTSO,"This is a set of DVDs to take someone from beginner to advance kettlebell training at a very low price. This is an all-around kettlebell program that will suit almost any fitness level. A kettlebell, this DVD set and Luries' Kettlebells for Dummies are all you need to go far with kettlebell training.",1327363200,4,301,4.69811320754717
4685122,4,B005FRWTSO,"I wanted a solid KB workout with good foundation instruction and got it with this video. I'm using a 25lb KB and even the 1st 2 ""instructional"" DVDs leave me sore for days. Haven't tried the Warrior or Bootcamp DVDs yet, but just the 2 beginner DVDs were worth the full price. No fancy music or camera work, this is as basic as it gets, but its a good workout in about 40 minutes.",1327017600,213,380,4.148648648648648
4685123,5,B005FRWTSO,I recommend this to anyone starting out with kettlebells.  The moves are clearly demonstrated and easy to understand.  Would recommend to all beginners.,1324425600,166,152,5.565217391304348
4685124,3,B005FRWTSO,"There is a mixed up in Title Volume . The Kettlebells the Iron Core Way Volume ONE should be Volume TWO instead. When I played Volume ONE , found it too advance for beginners . In volume Two that you find foundation kettlebell exercise , like the swing , clean etc . I HOPE mine is an isolated set , and Mill Creek Entertainment will look into it .

4685126,2,B005FRWTSO,"I was looking for another kettlebell workout to supplement the one I have been doing for years.  I have tried a few times to do these videos but just couldn't get through them.  Most of all, I found the trainer to be incredibly annoying!  The way she talked, the way she breathed, was so irritating that I had to turn the video off.  And the couple of other times I tried, I found that I didn't care for her moves.  I am used to Kelly Coffey Meyers workouts...this just doesn't compare and I just can't get into them.  She moves way to slow for me.",1514851200,,548,4.171428571428572

4685129,4,B005FRWTSO,"I haven't used Kettlebells much, so I wanted something to help with my form. The reviews said the instructions were good, and I agree. The only issue I have is that workout 1 and 2 move too slowly for me. The breaks in between movements are 30 seconds, followed by two minutes between circuits. I am new to Kettlebells, but not to exercise. So, it's not advanced enough in that way. I now use the breaks for quick cardio or ab work. That helps keep my heart rate up. Otherwise, I like it. I love using the kettlebells for variety in my weekly routines.",1511913600,3,552,4.3173076923076925

I did the Volume 2 workout and the boot camp using a 15 lb. kettlebell.  The boot camp was too much for me having not used my kettlebell in awhile.  Volume 1 & 2 will be perfect until I get stronger.  I don't mind the 30 second break, I get on my bike or mini trampoline, 30 seconds goes by fast when you are doing something with that time.  I also have a Kelley Coffey KB workout, that on has 15 sec. breaks which aren't enough for me.  I think I will progress to a heavier KB with the Iron Core Workouts.",1504396800,,634,3.937007874015748

4685146,2,B005FRWTSO,"I was really disappointed by this. It was very very long to do a simple work out. She has you done one set and then a 30 sec cooling after each one!!!! I can't remember if it took 45 mins to do one work out or an hour. It is takes serious time to finish it. Also, she must not explain how to hold the kettle ball  right cause my arms hurt badly, not sore, but the joints at my elbow. It took about 3 weeks for my elbows not to feel like they had been over extended. I don't know if I will try it again cause I'm worried I'm going to hurt my arms again.",1494460800,,552,3.717948717948718
4685147,5,B005FRWTSO,"I've ordered a number of kettle bell workouts and was kind of put off by this one but I'm so glad I ordered this.  The first two dvd's show you the exercises with breaks between each one.  Very nice.  I haven't moved up to the third or fourth dvd, but am still getting my form correct before moving forward.  Don't be afraid with the title.  This is a great value and a great set for a kettle bell workout.  I would recommend this for beginners or if you've used kettle bells before.",1494201600,6,483,4.195652173913044

4685150,5,B005FRWTSO,"I will say I wish I knew about Kettle Bells sooner, after hours of research on finding the best video this was the best reviewed out there and I went with it. I am happy I did this was amazing and cant wait to do my next session and trust me I have never said that before with any workout program I have ever done and I have done a lot I own just about every Beach body program and never felt like this before about an exercise program. For the price its well worth it you get four DVD's and she teaches proper form which is really important. Right now I feel every muscle in my body screaming and I worked up a sweat real quick. She does give you 30 second breaks in between each circuit and that is not a problem for me I liked that gave me a chance to get a drink and catch my breath. I highly recommend this DVD.",1490745600,6,816,3.9216867469879517
4685151,5,B005FRWTSO,I love this dvd. It has great workouts and as you get one workout down it takes you to three other workouts from beginner to advanced.

4685159,3,B005FRWTSO,"This set is 2 DVDs of instruction and 2 of exercise routines. The instructions are extremely dull to get through because there are 30 second breaks between EACH move taught. Skipped it. I tried the first exercise routine video. It was definitely challenging for my body, but it repeats the same set of moves 4 times. By the end of the second round I was insanely bored. Call me hard to please, but I will NOT do this video because I dread the boredom. The sets are hard, and because the moves aren't rotated it's hard to move your mind past the pain and exhaustion. There isn't even peppy music to sweat to. I'm sorry, but it's extremely boring. Worth $10? Yeah if you want to do a intense but boring workout at home for an hour. But I feel terrible for her gym lackies who are just trudging through the moves and probably paid a crazy membership. They don't show any individuality or modifications, just the same boring moves.",1486512000,,927,4.458823529411765

4685171,5,B005FRWTSO,"There is a lack of male reviewers for this product. I believe most men lift weights at near max and very few reps and kind of fall out of training as they get older. That's a shame.

As a man approaching forty I think this routine is fantastic. Higher number of reps with a smaller weight, and targeting the whole body.

The advice online is for men to pick up a 35lb kettlebell. However, this routine is really intense only stopping for thirty seconds between exercises. Because it is so aerobic you may want to try with 25lbs first. There's a massive dude in the background and he looks beaten by the end of the vid and he appears to be using a 35lb bell.  Well, I'm not a massive dude. I'm a 6' 163 lb aging software engineer. If you're looking for a basis for comparison there it is.

Goals are important. I'm trying to gain a bit of muscle to assist in blood sugar regulation. I'm also trying to get heart healthy and raise my hdl. For those goals I think this program will work great.",1481414400,8,990,4.25

4685185,5,B005FRWTSO,"I loved this dvd set.  I am not the normal dvd, sit in my house, work out person.  I usually feel like if I am going to work out I need to go somewhere to push me to do it.  I finally made up my mine that I was going to commit to an at home workout.  I browsed amazon and came across this tape.  It was cheap so I felt like if it didn't work out it wasn't one of those really expensive waste of money things.  Well I loved the dvds.  They were so good and easy to follow.  It was a build me up dvd set.  I stayed on disc 1 for a couple weeks and then went to disc 2 for a couple weeks and then decided to up my weights from 15lbs to 20 lbs and started disc 1 all over again.  Then I started to look at disc 3 and 4.  After gaining the muscle by doing this every day and going up in weight I was able to do all the exercises in the dvd.  I started in December and by the end of February, I lost 41 lbs.  I did watch my diet and ate only healthy foods, no snacks, no fast food and no alcohol.  Other than that I did this workout 6 days a week and did it hard, did not mosey through it and Ill tell you it really worked for me.  I am so happy with myself now and I continue to do this during my lunch break every day still with a 20lb weight to continue toning.  I highly recommend if you are willing to be patient and dedicated for at least 3 months with the diet and workout.",1469059200,20,1374,3.654109589041096
4685186,3,B005FRWTSO,After reading the reviews I decided to give this DVD a try to vary my workout.  I have to agree that the first two workouts aren't worth much and there are too many rest periods.  However the DVD's are worth it for the iron core boot camp and iron core warrior workouts.  There are rest periods in the warrior workout but she has suggestions to stay active during the pauses if you prefer.,1468022400,2,389,4.301369863013699

The screen actually has a countdown on it for the break. This is no way to work out. You cannot stop and go like that. I do not recommend this.,1462406400,2,297,3.8852459016393444

4685207,5,B005FRWTSO,I have been using this DVD for my days that I do not run. Absolutely great. Easy to follow and worth the money for several dvd's that you can rotate out.

4685211,5,B005FRWTSO,I haven't workout in a while. I love how she tells you when to breath. The workout it easy to follow,1459468800,2,100,3.8095238095238093

4685214,3,B005FRWTSO,"I really tried to like this, since I'm new to kettlebell, but this is so boring. She does the same 3 or 4 routines for repeated sets. Ugghhhh. Glad I only paid 8 bucks for it!",1458777600,,175,3.888888888888889
4685215,5,B005FRWTSO,I bought this a while ago and it took me quite a while to work up the motivation to do it. I bought workout gloves with grip ahead of time by recommendation of a friend because she said it will give you blisters. I also wrapped socks around my wrists so the kettle bell wouldn't bruise my wrist when it slammed back. Everything seemed to work great cause the only thing that was hurting by the end of the video was my muscles. I couldn't quite make it through the entire first video on my first try because it is really intense. I highly highly recommend this workout video. Great value for the price and if you're doing the moves correctly you're most definitely going to feel the burn!,1458259200,4,687,4.333333333333333
4685216,5,B005FRWTSO,"Just did my first kettlebell workout using this program and wow...I'm spent! I've done Insanity, T25, & most recently, Max30 plus I run 2-3 miles 4-5 times a week, so I'm in pretty decent shape. However, I needed a more strength focused program to add to the mix and in doing research, I discovered that Kettlebells, in some cases, are better than tradional weights. So I decided to buy one and along with it, this program.
The music kinda sucks, but the actual workout routine is great. She goes over proper technique before jumping into the 3 part circuit so even if you've never even touched a Kettlebell before (like me), you'll have at least somewhat of a clue as to what you're doing.
I highly recommend this program to anyone looking into starting a Kettlebell routine.",1458086400,3,776,4.671532846715328

4685218,2,B005FRWTSO,Complicated and boring.  I highly recommend Gin Miller's kettlebell dvd's for fun and enjoyable workouts.,1457308800,2,105,6.0
4685219,4,B005FRWTSO,Could use a bit more definition of the motions in the introduction (only shows one camera angle and minimal explanation).  The workout circuits themselves are good and having multiple DVDs provides the ability to change things up so it doesn't get boring.  A good starting point but you may want to watch a few other videos about form also.,1457308800,,340,4.745762711864407

She keeps reminding you to do certain things to protect yourself and get the best benefit for the workout.

4685230,5,B005FRWTSO,"This is the best kettle beginner video! Sarah moves at a pace that allows you to feel confident about each motion. I appreciate that the workouts are broken down into sets which in my opinion prevents exhaustion. With this dvd I felt worked out as opposed to beaten up if you know what I mean so I really enjoyed it. The one improvement I would add is some kind of timer to let the viewer know how much time is left or how many reps or sets are left ie 2 out 4 sets would help to let you know how close you are to completion.  This isn't a deal breaker for me though,  I just plan to do a 30 or 40 minute workout and press pause once I've reached that time box. It comes with 4 dvds which is great.

I would consider myself in very good shape, since I workout 5-7 days a week doing Zumba, Taebo and Shaun T's Hip Hop Abs and Rockin' Body, but I wanted to add some resistance training.  I was able to get through the 1st dvd of Iron Core Kettlebell, without a problem, but when I popped in the 2nd one, I laughed and said ""I don't think so.""  I even played the introduction part of the 2nd dvd, looking for some explanation on how to do the new moves, but there was no explanation or step-by-step, which would have been extremely helpful.  There was one move that involved a squat and roll back on your butt, which would have probably spelled a week on Aleve or an emergency room visit for me.  I can only squat down so far and being over 55, and rolling back on my butt from a squat position, wasn't happening.  After seeing part of the 2nd dvd, I didn't even bother popping in the 3rd or 4th dvd.

It is slow, repetitive, and maybe a bit boring,  but I definitely get a great workout every time I use it and that is what I look for in a workout dvd.  It is almost addicting. Great when I am short on time. I've done the Iron Core Way  #1 and #2 several times to get the proper form, which is so important. Even when  I go back and do these two  dvds, I still get a great workout. I try to do the Boot Camp every other day.  There is a minute wait time in between sets, but I think if I did the workout with only 30 seconds in between, it may get too tough. I have been using these dvds for about 4 weeks.  I have not tried the Iron Core Warrior yet, but plan to this week. Trying to work my way up to it.  I have kettle bells from 3lbs to 15 lbs. and am able to use a different weight for different moves.  I feel I am getting stronger and so  I just ordered an 18 lb and 20 lb kettle bell because I really feel this is making a difference. Not strong enough to use the  25 lb kettle bell like the instructor uses. I am 60 years young and that may be pushing it. Can't beat if for the price.",1441929600,2,1199,3.8137651821862346

4685298,3,B005FRWTSO,This DVD is not as awesome as the previous customers have posted.  Their reviews are so odd that I think they may be paid by the company to endorse this product.  The workouts are fine and do a good job of working the whole body.  If you have bad knees this may not be right for you because the workouts require doing a lot of squats and lunges.  It also seems as if this series was not professionally done because of the mistakes and weird editing.,1434412800,4,449,4.186046511627907
4685299,4,B005FRWTSO,Very good program.  Suggest you have multiple kettlebells to follow along as some movements stress muscles that can carry less load.  The introduction very useful if you are new to kettlebells.,1434412800,,193,5.193548387096774

The instructor is clear and concise. I like her no fluff approach. She's very encouraging.  The only negative I can point to is there is no cool down stretch.  I had to quickly look for guidance in another DVD to help myself cool down.  But honestly for the price I am not surprised. It already contains so much.

The reviews on Amazon were also helpful and I now understand why this product is so well-reviewed. There are schools of thought on working out with kettlebells and I the videos I did from the library seemed more ""fad"". You can really injure yourself with a kettlebell if you don't have basic knowledge of your body, movement, and weights. The added momentum with a kettlebell is challenging and this set of videos will see you more safely through the process of a workout. I've been doing these videos for a few months now and am not yet bored. The variety of these workouts and the instruction are its biggest value!

4685319,2,B005FRWTSO,"The instructor is competent but the video fails to provide side views for movements.  Kettlebells and free weights generally require close attention to form.  Seeing the side views as well as the front is essential.  The instructor's narration as to what on should be doing is worth far less than seeing the posture.  Surprisingly, she uses 2 additional students as examples but again, the video does not show any of them from the sides.

4685328,3,B005FRWTSO,The first two DVDs are very basic. There are definitely too many 30second breaks in between exercises. Best for a very novice kettlebell user.

With this workout we both get our goals:  he rests in between sets and I do cardio like jumping jacks or marching in place.  So far we have only done Volume 1.

Exercises are repetitive.  Sarah lists a set of exercises for the first set, then just repeats the same set three more times.  Though she's continuously talking she rarely talks about the exercise; she could be spending this talk time providing tips and encouragement.

Speaking of encouragement; Sarahs encouragement falls flat.  She repeats the same phrases but not in a heartfelt manner and I find myself wishing she would stop talking.  If you have nothing useful to say then keep it to yourself.",1424476800,,750,4.850393700787402

However, I can't really say this is good.  The instructor, the background, the music, the ""extra"" people in the workout lack any enthusiasm or energy to inspire and motivate.  The workout is very basic, sluggish and lacks intensity.  I will say the instructor gives good cues.  I taught aerobics for over 20 years myself.  Good cues aren't enough to keep people coming back.  If you don't inspire and energize people, how will they stay motivated, especially at home?  Very disappointed in these videos.  Try any kettle bell workout by Kelli Roberts.

Sarah Lurie does a great job instructing and the workouts are really good. I had tried getting into kettlebells for a while, but the other workouts I had were too advanced and I kept hurting my back due to bad form. Since using Iron Core kettlebell, no issue, really helped me perfect my form and gave me a great workout.

If I had any complaints it would be that the two basic workouts have too long a break in-between exercises (30 seconds). I fixed that issue by doing some push-ups and jumping jacks  or running inplace to fill the time until the next exercise.

The other complaint is the low quality of the two basic workouts, it's not a big deal, but doesn't help. The other workouts are high quality.

I had tried Jillian Michaels kettlebell workout and loved it so I went looking for other kettlebell DVD's.  I like the moves, but overall the DVD seems very cheesy.  It is not professional quality.  After each move there is a 30 second break, which I started fast-forwarding through.  At the end of the first pass through the moves, there is a 1 minute break.  I thought maybe the second time through the breaks would be taken out, but they are not.  I don't have a ton of time to exercise, so I like to get the most bang for my buck.

I had never used kettlebells before and was looking for something that would show me correct technique while also going me a good workout and this does exactl that. At first I was annoyed by all the breaks and found them unnecessary but once I moved up from a 10 pound kettlebell to a 15 pound one I realized why the breaks are there. When I was only using 10 pounds it was pretty easy and not very taxing, so if you think there are too many breaks you are probably not using a heavy enough kettlebell.

I did my best researching trainers, disks to buy and kettlebells- what weight to begin with ( I never really found that answer, but I have always been stronger than most women so I just guessed 10 lbs to start.)  Everyone says banging your wrist is bad technique but she (and nobody else that I found) does not show in slow motion how to do it ""correctly"".  I watched over and over, I tried in slow motion practice to see if I was emulating her correctly, I keep banging my wrist.  This stuff all got shoved in the corner after 2 wks with this disk never to be used again.

I decided to pick a fitness routine that would fit what I've learned. Cardio machines waste time and put unneeded stress on the body making it harder to lose and maintain weight loss due to the release of the stress hormone cortisol. Weight loss and health is 80% diet (what you eat) and 20% exercise (what you do). The best workout is strength training and I read in Tim Ferriss's amazing book, The 4 Hour Body, kettlebells build muscle quickly without wasting time.

The reason I like this DVD... its sweet, simple, and to the point. She also stops after every set and allows you to relax, thus reducing the body's need to become stressed and reducing the need for cortisol. This increases gains without extra work...work smarter, not harder. Don't be a mindless hamster on a wheel going nowhere fast.",1412726400,11,927,4.722222222222222

She explains the moves really well and gives you time in between each exercise. I really needed the break at first and then as I got more confident with the moves and not as winded I started fast forwarding the breaks to move through the work out faster. The boot camp and warrior workouts are great and don't take a lot of time. I'm a little (well, a lot) late to kettle bell work outs but better late than never!

The last 2 dvds are bootcamp style and you do about 5 exercises and then get a minute break between circuits.  There is a suggestion for an exercise for the people who do not want to rest in between circuits.

Whew!  I finally made it through viewing all 4 dvds.  You get a lot of footage for less than $10, but I am sheerly amazed at the monotony of the workouts.

On the first dvd I noticed that she did a few exercises and then repeated them.  I thought this was weird, but I didn't harp on it.

Then I watched the rest of the dvds, and Sarah literally lists 5 or 6 exercises and you do the same 5 or 6 exercises in the SAME EXACT ORDER over and over again for 30 to 40 minutes.

This stands out because I own multiple other kettlebell dvds, and the exercises continue to change throughout the workout on those other dvds.

That is my main critique here, the monotony.  Repeating the same few exercises makes me feel as if I am being cheated a little.

I will say that Sarah is in great shape.  Her arms and shoulders could be a walking advertisement to the benefits of kettlebell workouts.",1405728000,,894,4.2

4685475,5,B005FRWTSO,"This video is great, 4 videos for that price is unbeatable, and they are great, I would recommend them, I have spent more on other videos that are not good. She knows her form and she keeps me motivated. ditch the Jillian Michell's Shred it w/ Weights, her form was bad and dangerous actually, she clearly isn't a certified instructor on kettlebells like this lady is I am guessing her name is Sarah. Well worth 5 stars!",1401667200,2,420,4.467532467532467
4685476,5,B005FRWTSO,"Liked these videos.  Learned the details of kettle bells with a slow start with teaching exercise along with form and technique.  Safety and injury prevention is stressed.  Then learned some exercise programs to work the core and the entire body.  Great programs that leave me huffing and feeling great.  A good intro, with good exercise programs for regular workouts.",1401062400,,368,5.169491525423729
4685487,2,B005FRWTSO,I didn't care for this video.  Have only used once but didn't find it very motivating.  It is really for beginners in that there is a lot of rest in between exercise.,1400976000,,166,4.15625
4685488,5,B005FRWTSO,I went through the first two videos. The form appears to be good. Have been doing the boot camp workout and will try the warrior DVD next. The boot camp is a pretty good quick workout!,1400976000,,184,4.138888888888889
4685489,2,B005FRWTSO,I have only done the second video which is actually the beginning video to start with. I don't care for the pauses between lifts and usually keep doing the movement til the next lift. I have not tried the other 3 videos yet. The videos are informative for just starting out with kettlebells. Just didn't hold my interest and felt bored.,1400457600,,336,4.524590163934426
4685490,5,B005FRWTSO,"Me:  Busy father.  Prior weightlifting experience.  New to kettlebells.  Have purchased 4 different DVDs from variety of instructors.  My take on each is below.

Best:  Sarah Lurie Iron Core Kettlebell
1)  Disks one and two are good for novices (little or no experience with kettlebells).  Sarah has excellent technique and is a good instructor.
2)  Disks three and four provide several routines for beginning and intermediate users.  Can grow with your fitness level by increasing weight of kettlebell.
3)  Amazing value.  You will not be disappointed.

Better:  Jessica Huthmaker
1)  Disk came free with a GoFit Kettlebell and provides a varied 25 minute strength and conditioning workout.  Instructional portion of the DVD is average.

Good:  Keith Weber Extreme Kettlebell Cardio Workout
1) 6 different workouts which range from 6-10 minutes long and can be combined into a superwork or (as I do them) pick and choose for 30 minutes total.
2) Not for beginners.  Best for intermediate users.  His ""core workout"" like his sunglasses is straight out of the 80s.
3) Nice variety and a good value.

Terrible:  Kettlebody by Brook
1) She had clearly heard of kettlebells before making these DVDs.
2) Exercises are performed too quickly and with poor form.
3) All 3 DVDs suffer from Brooks personality.  ""More cardio, less lardio"" is a her ""motivational"" phrase.
4) Enough said.",1400284800,66,1376,5.094594594594595
4685491,5,B005FRWTSO,"I ordered this dvd after reading the reviews and it is amazing!  It is a great workout!  If I want just a quick workout, I put in the 30 minute dvd and it gets me going.",1400025600,,169,3.6666666666666665
4685492,1,B005FRWTSO,"I tried this after doing Kettleworx for 6 weeks just to have some variation.  The instructor is very boring, no spunk and the way she goes through the exercises is not fun.  Kettleworx is much better in my opinion.",1399852800,5,214,4.461538461538462
4685493,5,B005FRWTSO,"I have just received this DVD, played thru the first circuit and already feeling wonderful.  The instructor gives great instructions and demonstrations before getting into the circuits.",1399507200,,185,5.851851851851852
4685494,5,B005FRWTSO,Just perfect instruction for the novice (like me) or someone who is quite adept at using the kettlebell!,1399507200,,104,4.833333333333333
4685495,5,B005FRWTSO,this is a great workout set for the price I am very impressed. I ordered this as my first kettlebell DVD and I have yet to even do 2 of the DVDs......im afraid of the boot camp one! ha.,1399334400,3,185,3.769230769230769
4685496,4,B005FRWTSO,"Sarah Lurie progresses you well. It's up to you to pick the weight kettlebell you can handle safely. The two-handed swing is a marvelous exercise for abs and butt, though if you don't do it right you can hurt yourself. I highly recommend working first with a trainer to make sure you are using the right form. Then, later, continue with these progressively more demanding exercise.",1398816000,,381,4.787878787878788
4685497,5,B005FRWTSO,Sarah is an awesome instructor who knows how to keep you engaged and motivated. I have fun working out in the comfort of my own home with such a great set of DVDs. The workouts are tough but fun and you will feel the burn afterwards. The best part about this DVD set is that you get 4 DVDs for the price of one! I would definitely recommend this set to anyone looking for a great way to get in shape.,1398816000,,400,3.950617283950617
4685498,5,B005FRWTSO,This is a good quality DVD and the workouts are great. It's just what I was looking for. Thank you.,1398643200,,99,4.0
4685499,5,B005FRWTSO,"I like that they have instructions on how you are supposed to do each workout. I haven't done the extreme workout yet, but level 1 and level 2 both make me sweat buckets. I started my weight at 15 lbs and it was the perfect weight to begin with.",1398211200,,245,4.020408163265306
4685500,5,B005FRWTSO,"Great set of workout DVD's, I enjoyed both 1&2 thoroughly. I am a beginner, never picked up a kettle bell or any other type of weights before. Decided to give these a try since I wanted to tone up a bit, worked great.",1398038400,,217,4.069767441860465
4685501,5,B005FRWTSO,"I worked at a gym where I was occasionally offered free training by various expensive trainers, in order to be able to recommend them. One of the best work-outs I ever got was from a trainer who used a kettlebell. I purchased one for myself, but could only remember one or two of the moves he taught. This video included all of the moves that high-priced trainer taught and then some! I am so pleased with the knowledge that the woman in the video has. The video is very professional, moves through the intro at a quick enough pace that you aren't left anxious or bored, and she demonstrates proper technique so that you can move through her video without injury and getting the best work out possible. When people say ""work out smarter, not harder"" there is truth to it. Knowing proper form can dramatically increase the results you get from a work out without you having to put in more hours. After the great and informative intro, the work out itself is super easy to follow and not at all intimidating. It has been several years since I have worked out regularly, so I am out of shape cardio-wise and can't even get through some of my other videos. You get regular breaks with this one and while I felt my muscles being toned and my heart rate increasing, I was able to comfortably get through this video. I would highly recommend this to anyone getting back into exercise or into it for the first time, and definitely anyone who wants to use a kettlebell at home. Kettlebell workouts in general provide the toning aspects of weight training with the cardio aspects of quicker and repetitive movement. For someone who hates cardio, this is one way I can get through it and still enjoy the weight training side of a good workout. I would go so far as to say, after years of various classes, training sessions, and dozens of videos, this stands out as one of the best I've utilized.",1397174400,14,1884,4.495626822157434
4685502,5,B005FRWTSO,I am enjoying the DVD.  I love the demonstrations -  before the actual sets begins.  It is easy once you get the hang of it.  Worth the price.,1397001600,,142,3.9642857142857144
4685503,5,B005FRWTSO,This workout goes into step-by-step detail on how to stand and how to hold the Kettlebell properly.  I absolutely love this workout!  I will use it for many years to come!,1396915200,,171,4.483870967741935
4685504,5,B005FRWTSO,"This was a great set, especially for the price value.  I was new to KB and wanted a fitness boost so I ordered these DVD's and find that they are easy to follow.  I didn't think the instructionals would help a workout, but boy was I wrong.  All of my muscles were sore the next day, especially my abs and rear end.  I felt like I had gotten my 60-90 min in the gym in a much shorter time.  I rotate between these and the gym for variety.  I started on a 10lb and am working up to a 15lb and hope to go even higher soon enough.",1396915200,,526,3.824074074074074
4685505,1,B005FRWTSO,this cd is terrible in the way it is made. no music and the instructor seemed unsure of herself. I regret buying it. I would recommend finding something better to work out to as this will only let you down. I would never recommend this cd to anyone.,1396828800,,249,4.208333333333333
4685506,2,B005FRWTSO,2 of the 4 discs give you a good workout.  I like something a bit more upbeat.  I do not care for how monotone the instructor is,1396656000,,128,3.7037037037037037
4685507,4,B005FRWTSO,I like this video but she takes 30 second rest breaks after EVERY set.  I find this annoying.  I haven't figured out how to skip the rest breaks without holding fast forward on the remote (also annoying during a workout).  Otherwise I really like the dvd's and you get 4!,1396396800,,271,4.38
4685508,5,B005FRWTSO,Fallen in love with Kettlebell training! This is a no nonsense training dvd packet for a price that really can't be beat. The kettlebells kick my butt but I feel like I've worked afterwards.,1396310400,,190,4.617647058823529
4685509,4,B005FRWTSO,"I've been exercising regularly for the last two years.  Needed a change in my workout and found the Kettlebell Scorcher Series.  In reviewing those DVD's I found this one.  I was new to kettlebell training and needed a ""beginners"" course before starting the Scorcher Series (which, I highly recommend).  The instructor gave excellent explination of technique...and...you rest a full minute between sets.  Excellent for ANYONE new to an exercise program.  I only used it for a short while, as I like to combine a fair amount of cardio into my training; however, could not have begun the Scorcher Series without it.",1395878400,,613,5.01980198019802
4685510,5,B005FRWTSO,A lot of great workouts at a great value. Kettle bell workouts are very effective. A whole body work out.,1395705600,,105,4.3
4685511,1,B005FRWTSO,To me these DVD's are mostly talk and not enough action. Definitely a beginners work out because it has too many breaks and is very slow paced.,1395273600,4,143,4.333333333333333
4685512,5,B005FRWTSO,This is a great work out.  4 DVDs so you should never get bored.  The first one does the kettle bell exercise and a 30 second rest In between  each one.  I jump rope in the 30 seconds and get a fantastic workout.,1394928000,,212,3.86046511627907
4685513,3,B005FRWTSO,"This is a struggle for me. It has helpful workouts, don't mistake that, even though some of them will help create your normal body makeup; just a stronger setting of such. It'll be your natural form/build with muscle tone and more definition, but the forward swings cause straight on muscle development. But, some ppl are trying to change their shape, and that would make these just a maintenence circuit set. And I see the biggest problem is the breaks in between the circuit pieces. You should only rest for 1 min. after a complete circuit of exercises. Like, four or five different ones per circuit, no break until one circuit is complete. That's knowledge from a personal trainer. So, it's not a good DVD to follow like class instruction. And, I say choose if you know other ways to create the total body makeup you desire. It's not bad for toning your body and abs if you can remember the exercises and count on your own. But to use every time you train, it's not recommended if you actually want results and endurance built. Remember the endurance...
P.S. I went back and read others' reviews. I believe I should watch the other volumes before I make my total decision. Be back soon...",1394755200,2,1191,4.622641509433962
4685514,5,B005FRWTSO,"Being a newbie to kettlebell, I was hoping to find a training DVD to help build a good foundation for my workouts and this fits the bill perfect. Instruction is clear and precise that it almost feels like a one on one session with a trainer. Can't wait to get further along on my workouts  , these DVDs will definitely help!",1394668800,,324,4.311475409836065
4685515,5,B005FRWTSO,"I LOVE this DVD package. It comes with 4 DVD's and all of them give you an incredible workout at various levels from beginning to advanced. Yes she stops after each set for a 30 second rest, but I personally needed that especially when I first started out! It is a great workout to use at home as you will sweat immensely if you do one full DVD workout!",1394668800,3,353,4.130434782608695
4685516,5,B005FRWTSO,"What a challenge some of these workouts are! This was such a great deal, 4 workout dvd set for under $20 bucks! I already own a kettlebell so I'm good!",1394668800,,151,4.066666666666666
4685517,5,B005FRWTSO,"This 4 DVD set walk you through the basics as though you have never used a kettlebell before. The workout DVDs are solid, providing intense, but do-able 30m routines. Decent production values and the music is alright. The instructor is knowledgeable, with good form and tips without any unnecessary commentary. Did I say this is a great deal?",1394582400,,342,4.913793103448276
4685518,5,B005FRWTSO,I am 45 years old and a desk jockey + I live in MN so that means long winters.  Wish I had discovered this workout sooner.  The first dvd is for beginners and gives you some confidence because it actually has excercises that you can do.  My fat was crying when I finished my first workout.  (sweating)  I have bought several workouts  in the past that just end up collecting dust because you have to be in shape to actually do them.  They are just too hard.  You end up feeling like a failure from the onset because you can't make it through the first 10 minutes.  There are four dvd's in this collection that range in fitness levels.  I actually look forward to exercising because I can actually get through a workout and feel great when I'm done.  I would definitely recommend this workout,1394409600,3,791,4.386206896551724
4685519,4,B005FRWTSO,"I really like the kettlebell workout. The first two DVDs will become obsolete, they are primarily introductory sessions. The next two are challenging. Must use two kettlebells.",1394323200,,176,5.555555555555555
4685520,5,B005FRWTSO,"I bought this video because it had good reviews and it was under 8.00 and it came with 4 DVD's.  The instructor is very good she has a tutorial section where she explains all the exercises. This was the second kettlebell DVD that I've bought in the last month. So far I've only done the first two volumes. Since I started with Lauren Brooks I was already using a 25lb KB so I continued with that with this series. So far there is only one exercise that right now I cannot do and that is the deck squat, I believe that it is an advanced manuver, so I substitute that with hip thrusters, a move that I learned from Lauren's video. The deck squat is in vol. 2 I will continue to rotate the videos as KB is an awesome workout.",1394064000,,722,4.120567375886525
4685521,4,B005FRWTSO,"Overall, a great value for 4 DVDs at less than $2 per DVD.  Instructions are very clear and easy to follow.  It could be somewhat boring if you are more advanced into exercising with kettlebell.  The 30 seconds break in between moves are a little too long for me.  Would be better if it's cut down to 10 to 15 seconds, but it may be appropriate for people who just start with kettlebell.  I would recommend this to those who are new to kettlebell.  You can't find better value and instructions than this set.",1393718400,2,508,4.351063829787234
4685522,4,B005FRWTSO,"There are a lot of good reviews that others have already posted, so I'll just make a few quick comments. I think these are great workouts. If you're new to exercise itself, you should be able to do them without issue. I say this because Lurie's introductory practice sessions are very well done. She is a good instructor who does an excellent job teaching proper form and technique in a way that is simple and encouraging. However, if you're not new to exercise, then I think you'll still enjoy them. I'm in the military and workout on a regular basis, and I find several of the routines to be thoroughly challenging.

So the workouts are great, but I feel that the presentation leaves a little bit to be desired. I get the impression that Lurie wasn't used to being in front of the camera and making training videos when these were shot. That's not a dealbreaker for me, but I feel it's worth mentioning. She gets the job done, and she gets it done well, so if you're looking for a good kettlebell workout series that gets your heart rate up and improves your muscle tone and endurance, then I don't think you'll be disappointed. Just don't expect a highly polished and dynamic presentation.",1393113600,,1192,4.570093457943925
4685523,5,B005FRWTSO,Great workout. Easy with clear descriptions of movements. This exercise is deceptively Eady and will kick your butt. Several different workouts on the disc.,1393113600,,156,5.541666666666667
4685524,5,B005FRWTSO,"This is a great DVD set!  I used it to get started to kettlebell just after Christmas and it was extremely cheap.  I didn't really expect much do to that, however it is really good.  Great sets of workouts to get you introduced to Kettlebell and move on to your own workouts.

4685529,5,B005FRWTSO,"I am a former collegiate athlete who is now a stay at home mom. I needed an at home workout that would challenge me and have room for improvement and growth. I was looking for something more than a cute pink dumbell routine. I wanted a workout that I would not be bored of in 30 days (cough cough, Jillian). I wanted to learn something new in the fitness world. I found everything I needed in ICK. This series gives you so much bang for your buck. I was a complete kettlebell beginner when I purchased this. After using the DVDs for a year I consider myself intermediate/advanced. These 4 simple DVDs have that much progression in them. I am a pretty strong girl so I started with a 25 lb bell, which was perfect. When I first began with vol 1 and 2 I was huffing and puffing the whole 30 sec of each rest time, and I could barely walk after the workouts. But I improved so fast that soon I started adding my own cardio moves or other strength training moves during the rest periods to make it a really awesome workout. For a long time I was really scared to move on to the Boot camp and Warrior workouts, I wasn't sure what Sarah had up her sleeve to increase the challenge. But now I absolutely love those workouts too! They are such dynamic circuits and really work your whole body in a short amount of time. I know use a 35 lb bell or do lots of double KB moves with two 25 lb bells.

I love Sarah's simple and clear style. Her cuing on form is always spot on.  I love the instructional demo sections for the exercises. I think Sarah is an excellent model of fitness and strength. But most of all I love the results. I am so fit and lean working with kettlebells. I would recommend this DVD to anyone looking to learn the all the basics of KBs and have somewhere to go and still be challenged without having to purchase another DVD once they have mastered the basics.",1390521600,11,1871,4.20891364902507
4685530,4,B005FRWTSO,"It's easy to get sloppy on form when swinging a K-bell, but this dvd gives good reminders on clean form that really help you get the workout without the injury.

4685531,4,B005FRWTSO,"I bought this set when it was $6.99 and assumed that this came with one DVD. To my surprise, this comes with FOUR with nearly an hour's worth of workouts on each dvd. Awesome!

I've tried two of the DVDs so far and found them to be very effective. The next morning after each workout, I feel pretty sore. Sarah's presentation is very professional and this is definitely a no frills video. No fancy workout clothes or workout space. It really is all about the exercise. The one thing that I felt was a little annoying were the constant breaks. Just when I was getting into certain moves and sweating, Sarah would call for a 30 second break. I suppose it's all for our benefit as viewers so we can pause and get some water, but I felt like I would have gotten more from the DVD with less breaks. Because of the many breaks, the workout just kind of drags and it's easy to lose interest. Kettle ball workouts can be great once you have a good routine, so at the very least, this can give you some ideas on how to supplement gym or home workouts.

Still, this is a great deal and I highly recommend it!",1390003200,3,1098,4.248803827751196

She told me she was using kettle bells and that she loved the results...but I never tried it!  Then two months ago, I wanted to take my weight training exercise to a new level, so I decided to get a DVD that would introduce it to me and I found the Iron Core Kettlebell DVD by Sarah Lurie, ordered it and started working out!  I have to tell you, it was stranger than any other workout concept I'd ever tried but I am soooo glad that I did!  Not only did I see immediate results, I lost 20 lbs in 6 weeks....that has never happened to me before!  I NEVER weigh myself because I go by inches lost....but one day I was in a hotel fitness room about to work out and saw a scale and thought, ""why not?""  OMG!  When I discovered I'd lost 20 lbs I was shocked!!!  I kept readjusting the scale thinking, ""this just can't be true!"", but it was true!  When my daughter saw me she said, ""Mom, you look like a size 6!"" .....imagine me a size 6 at 55 years young....that's right, I'm 55 and look 30!  So, I want to tell you to try it...you won't be sorry!  Oh, and yes, I did change my diet a bit and cut out fried foods, reduced my sugar intake and ate more fresh fruits and veggies!

4685538,5,B005FRWTSO,"This is a bargain for the price from Amazon.  I have been exercising to this DVD for 2 months and like it very well.  It has routines for 3 levels of fitness and endurance and I still use the first level.  I get a good workout in about an hour.  I also reviewed her ""Dummies"" and got a lot from it although I didn't buy it yet.",1387238400,,327,3.8358208955223883
4685539,5,B005FRWTSO,"Ok, Sarah Lurie's kettlebell videos/dvd's are hard to find.  I have two of them and to be able to get more at such a low price is amazing to me.  I love Sarah Lurie's style, the subtle metal music she uses in volumes one and three that I have, and cannot wait to rip into the others that I don't have.  I am saving these for Christmas (as a gift from my cat, mind you. . . ) but instead of pigging out on munchies, I will be trying the new dvd's out because I know that Sarah Laurie's routines guarantee good fitness.  I am going to order another one just to have it on hand for a gift to someone else or should I need this again in the future.  These are that good.

If you have never tried kettlebell before, go slow.  This is the place to start out with this dvd set.  The amazing thing about this is that some are 62 minutes long:  no; that does not mean that you will be swinging a kettlebell around for over an hour.  It's just that she puts two workouts into one dvd at times.

Needless to say, I am a happy camper here.  Thanks again, Amazon.  You never fail me!",1386979200,2,1070,3.990566037735849

4685546,4,B005FRWTSO,"Discs 1 and 2 are pretty redundant to each other, but disc 3, Boot Camp, is challenging and the workout flies by, even though it is kind of repetitive. I'm looking forward to trying the hour-long workout once I get bored with the Boot Camp and a 20-lb kettlebell. What really sets the series up above other exercise videos I've seen is Sarah Lurie's straightforward and likeable approach. She manages to inspire you to work without trying to stamp her personality all over the place. Her instructions are concise and sensible and her cadence is perfect - she doesn't talk too little or too much and manages to insert good reminders about form in just where you need them to stay focused. Definitely a good springboard for coming up with your own workouts.",1385078400,2,755,4.684210526315789

I didn't want to spend a lot of money so I tried this video collection based on reviews and price point.  I'm really glad I decided to try it.  I find the instructor to be very informative and not at all annoying like so many others can be.  I also really like the workouts.  I feel like I've had a great workout upon completion of each video.  Kettlebells in general have really helped increase my muscle tone like no other exercise kick I've been on.",1384128000,,647,4.394957983193278

4685552,5,B005FRWTSO,"I read the reviews before purchasing this DVD set. The reviews were very accurate. This video set does not have any annoying music. Two of the videos only have the instructor in them. The other two have a male and female in the background who are dressed in gym attire and not distracting. There are breaks in the workout. These are helpful in recovering between sets if you need them. If you do not need a break, there are movements you can do to keep up your heart rate. The 4 disc set has a good variety. So you can build strength and/or get a cardio workout. On the boot camp disc she uses a 25# kettlebell. So this is a good strength workout.

None of the movements are herky-jerky like I have experienced from some other DVD's. These are easier on the knees. The movements are controlled and easy to learn. You will workout all parts of the body if you use all 4 discs. I like having the variety to use depending on what type of workout I want. There were comments on the loud breaths that the instructor uses. Yes, this is true. However, it is not that noticeable in all the DVD's and it is easy to tune it out if you need to. But it also can help you remember to focus on breathing. This is a great value for the money. It mostly depends on what type of workout you are looking for. This was my third kettlebell DVD I have used. I have used Kettlebell Body by Brook and a Jillian Michaels set as well. While I enjoyed them initially I ended up tiring of them and wanting something different. This DVD set is my favorite.",1382572800,13,1528,4.215017064846417

4685562,5,B005FRWTSO,If your new to using kettlebells this is a very good DVD. It starts with the basics and progresses with the different DVDs.,1379203200,,123,4.391304347826087
4685563,5,B005FRWTSO,"Like most aspiring home exercise enthusiasts, I have tried numerous DVDs, equipment, and exercise programs over the years. Most have been too hard, complicated, and time-consuming for my lazy, out of shape self to stick to. And most of the instructors have been annoying to the point of making me despise them before the video is halfway through. I bought this DVD set expecting more of the same, but really wanting to try out the kettlebell. I started slow, using a 10 lb kettlebell because I have fibromyalgia, and I spent a good 2 weeks just going over the foundation exercises before starting the first circuit. I started in February, and am now in September up to a 15 lb kettlebell, and have lost 20 pounds while gaining muscle. I have made it through the first- or really the second according to the label, they were still mislabeled when I bought this in 2012- DVD in the set, and have done the first circuit on the second DVD a few times also. I'm much stronger and I feel so much better, have more energy, and less pain. I think what makes the biggest difference for those of us that are out of shape when getting started is the 30 second breaks between sets. Getting a drink of water and catching your breath in between exercises really helps when you feel like you're dying after a minute of exercise. It also makes it possible to do things I could never do before while exercising, like make dinner. All of that said, this DVD is not perfect. The instructor is likable enough and she explains and demonstrates clearly, but her counts are sometimes off and the Lamaze-style breathing is kind of annoying, even though it's helpful. Even with those minor complaints, though, I would give this 6 stars if I could, because with all of the thousands of dollars I've spent over the years on exercise equipment and DVDs, this is the single best purchase I have made.",1379116800,16,1871,4.571428571428571
4685564,5,B005FRWTSO,If you want a great workout this is the video for you.  I originally was taking a kettle bell class but could not afford to go anymore.  I ordered this workout DVD hoping it was the same kind of workouts that I was doing in class.  IT WAS!!!,1379030400,,241,3.9791666666666665
4685565,5,B005FRWTSO,Love this workout! it's a really easy workout to follow and it isn't boring or slow. In 30 mins your done. Perfect,1378857600,,114,4.2272727272727275
4685566,5,B005FRWTSO,"One thing to remember when doing kettlebells (or any free weight exercise) - form matters! If you use incorrect form, you can get injured. What I like about Sarah Lurie's DVDs - she cares about form, and she not only gives you an introduction of each exercise, she also gives cues during the workout to help you with your form.

If you are a newbie when it comes to kettlebells - this is really important so you don't get injured! Obviously the best thing is to have a session with a certified instructor, but if you can't do that - at least Lurie goes into some detail.

For those who think the exercises are too easy - you might be using a kettlebell that is too light. I use 2 kettlebells - one for most of the exercise and a lighter one for the presses since I've got a sore shoulder I'm being careful with.

Once you've mastered the first volume, there are 3 more, with the bootcamp being very challenging. So this is a DVD set that will last you for a while.

I do alternate kettlebells with regular weights - I use a couple of different dumbbell DVDs. So I'll do upper body Mondays, legs Wed., and kettlebell F. I do cardio T and Th, yoga/stretching Saturdays and take Sunday off. As far as diet - I go to Sparkpeople and use their nutrition calculator to make sure I'm getting enough protein and staying within my calorie range. I eat mostly whole foods and very little processed junk. So far I've noticed a slow but steady and easily maintainable weight loss of about 1-2 pounds a week, 6-7 pounds a month. I'm not trying to lose weight fast, but to get healthy and strong and to lose weight in a way that I can maintain so I never gain it back.",1378339200,5,1654,4.274760383386582
4685567,5,B005FRWTSO,"I am just getting into Kettlebells, and really love this set.  I've tried a few others, they are too time consuming, and don't demonstrate proper form.  The only thing I don't like is the the inability to skip the cool off of 30 seconds to a minute between sets (on the disc one), I just fast forward - I have to work and I don't have time to stand there and wait.  Maybe on the other discs she goes straight through.  It's a hard workout on disc one for a person like me who's overweight and sits all day at a computer for work.  I can really tell it's making muscles work!  I can't wait til I feel like I've mastered the first one so I can go to the others!

I would highly recommend.",1378252800,,686,4.037037037037037

I got this 4 DVD set with a great set of workouts for an incredible price. Sarah knows what she's doing, is encouraging, and goes over form before you do the exercises. She is RKC certified instructor, has a great voice, and the video/DVD is very well put together.

I highly recommend her Videos, and I can't imagine why they are so inexpensive now!

I am not overly fit and for medical reasons shouldn't keep my heart rate too high for to long.  I found it to be progressive but not in-your-face impossible.  I sweated that's for sure and found it to be manageable.  The 30 second rests allowed me to bring my heart rate back down and I suffered no discomfort.  I'm sure as my weight decreases and fitness increases I will be able for the more robust workouts provided.  The only thing I will say is that there wasn't enough stretches before hand to stop muscles ""bunching"" after the workout.  I do my own stretching before I start the dvd every time.

Frankly, at 82 years of age and limited by severe arthritis, I can only do a few of the exercises-----but a few are better than none. As for comments that the video quality is not the best, I felt that it is more than adequate for accomplishing the objective-----to teach the ""how to's"" for basic and more advanced kettlebell exercise.

4685583,1,B005FRWTSO,"Only one of the four discs, Boot Camp, has any value with its one exercise sequence but it's not worth suffering through the annoying production embellishments and some risky exercise movements. The instructor uses a 25-lb. bell, has good form and cueing. Boot Camp's exercise sequence contains 3 or 4 sets of 4-5 different exercises,  One of the exercises requires yanking the bell, one handed, from a below waist dangle to a position straight-armed over the head repeatedly. Seemed like an invitation to shoulder injury. There are 30 second rests between sets rendered intolerable because of its annoying, guitar loop, which I think is repeated through all discs. The cost is low but it's not worth the trouble. I like Paul Katami's DVDs so will stay with those and will work my way up to his more advanced kettlebell DVDs.",1372896000,7,825,4.892857142857143

I've never touched a kettlebell before I got this workout and next to a live class or personal instructor this is the best workout I can give myself at home.  For 12 bucks I'm getting way more than I expected for my money.  I feel comfortable doing the workouts (not ""no burn"" comfortable, but the ""I don't think I'm going to pull something or throw the kettlebell because my forms's wrong and I don't understand the exercise"" kind of comfortable).

I look forward to my kettlebell workouts!",1368489600,6,732,4.557251908396947

If you're just starting to work out or use Kettlebell's, I suppose this DVD will benefit you. I tried the boot camp DVD 3 since the first two didn't benefit me, and I barely felt like I was getting a workout. You MUST have at least a 25 lb weight for it to work.

I don't care if the quality of the video (sort of home -video like) is good or not, I don't care much if or how she talks to the camera (she is MUCH more low keyed than Jillian), I care about breaking a sweat and getting a good work out in and I didn't get that with this.

I started out with Kathy Smith's Kettlebell workout & it was okay but the Iron Core Kettlebell teaches you ""true"" kettlebell techniques which provides you with a GREAT, total body workout.  There are 4 DVDs...2 beginner style & 2 serious, hard-core workouts.  I have had the DVDs for about a month & I am just moving on to the 2nd beginner style workout.

But the first two were just what I was looking for after my very first beginner DVD became a little too easy.  Kettlebells have been a miracle for me, and Lurie is just what I was looking for.  I don't have to bounce around on my toes or do the usual cardio.  She uses the kettlebell to do all of that and more, and I'm stronger and slimmer than I've been in years thanks to the first two DVDs.  The fact that you can have all four for such a low price should be incentive enough, but the workouts are fantastic.  Don't let the people who don't like the 30-second breaks between reps put you off.  That's recommended by most experts, and I'm glad she listened to them.

4685610,4,B005FRWTSO,"A few weeks ago, I knew nothing about kettlebell workouts. I kept hearing they were really good. I kept searching for a good, but beginner's, workout with a kettlebell. After reading all the good reviews about this DVD, I decided to give it a try. I've been using it for a few weeks, and this is what I have found:

- The workouts are CHALLENGING! This was #1 on my list
- Sarah is super encouraging the whole time. When I feel like giving up, she's on the screen saying, ""Good job!"" or ""Just a few more!""
- She interacts with the two other people on screen, reminding them about form and technique. This is a cue to watch yours and it helps
- Sarah takes time to explain the exercises
- The exercise is 1-2 minutes, then you get a 30 second break in between (allowing for water)
- You work in circuits and get a 1-2 minute break about every 10 minutes

Sometimes I'll fast forward through the breaks.

The only reason this DVD got 4 stars for me was because I had to guess which kettlebell to buy. Sarah doesn't touch on this subject at all. I ended up buying a 15 pound kettlebell, and though I can do most of the exercises, I can't do all of them. The kettlebell I have is just too heavy for some of them (ever hear of a person doing kettlebell breaking their radius? Yeah, that's exactly what it feels like is going to happen). However, I just skip over these exercises or repeat an exercise the DVD has already done.

Bottom line: I recommend this product, especially if you're JUST getting into kettlebell. I feel more toned even the same day. This is a wonderful DVD set.",1365811200,8,1578,4.285234899328859

During the break between sets, a written notice appears preparing the viewer for the next exercise and explaining what muscle groups are targeted.  Would have appreciated some coaching or information to selecting the right weight kettlebell.  I use a different weight kettlebell for different exercises. A four set DVD set that is reasonably priced is a great feature of this product as well.

Two instructional sets help with proper form (my only complaint would be the obviously forced ""small talk"" in between sets), and 3 workout sets. I've only done two of the three workouts, the third requires 2 kettle bells of the same weight - which I don't have yet. The workouts are full body, the instructions are easy to follow, Sarah Lurie is a great instructor - low key but very encouraging. If you need a more challenging workout, just get a heavier bell.

I cannot give an opinion on the product as a whole because I quit after the first warm up.  I do not suggest this video for people with knee problems.  The warm up exercises put tremendous load on the knee joint, and that's not a safe way to start a work out.",1360713600,7,533,3.8440366972477062
4685634,5,B005FRWTSO,"Work-out videos are fairly expensive, but this set of CD's provides excellent training at a reasonable price.  The first two CDs are basic work-outs for beginners and the next two CDs are for more experience kettlebell users.  I started using kettlbells approximately three months ago because they combine weight and aerobic training.  I was using a book as a guide, but I saw this video set for $5.99 (that was in Dec 2012) and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. I have been using the first CD for two weeks and I definitely feel like I am in better shape.  In the first video you will learn and perform kettlebell swings, cleans, squats, single-leg dead lifts, military press and up-right rows. You will preform one exercise, rest for 30 seconds, then move to another exercise until you complete the circuit and then repeat the circuit for a total of three sets.

I believe Sarah Lurie is no longer involved in kettlebells, but you can find plenty of her Iron Core Gym Youtube videos on Youtube.  I would definitely recommend this work-out for anyone interested in kettlebell training.",1360627200,7,1102,4.7434554973821985

Sarah Lurie structures her workouts in a way that gets your heart rate way up, but like classic weight training, she builds in 30-second rest periods between exercises in a circuit to give you a chance to let your muscles recoup, let your heart rate come down a tick, get a drink of water, and mentally prepare for the next set.

When I take my heart rate between sets, it's often at 80-90% of my max heart rate, but the built in rests allow me to keep going through the whole workout without giving up.

On a side note, my Volume 1 and Volume 2 DVDs are also mislabeled (as other reviewers have mentioned), but it's no matter. The workouts are all excellent, and they make the time fly by.",1359158400,6,809,4.386666666666667

After starting on the first DVD yesterday - I am still sore the next day - found glut and quad muscles didn't know could be exercised with a kettle bell!  LOVE IT!  Great set of DVDs and would highly recommend.  Ms. Lurie does a great job of explaining and then demonstrating.  She walks you through the exercise including breathing and telling you what muscle groups you are working with a particular exercise.  She provided 30 second breaks - and after her first DVD - the entire group was sweating.  Would highly recommend it...by the way did I say I LOVE IT!,1358985600,,902,4.321428571428571

All you have to do in order to make the circuit more challenging to adapt to increased fitness is to increase kettlebell weight, trust me you will be left breathless if you push yourself.

Sara, is a awesome instructor that is always encouraging you to keep your form tight without being annoying in the least, she is simply a natural.

4685657,5,B005FRWTSO,"Brand new to kettlebells, I purchased this DVD set along with the book ""Enter the Kettlebell!"" by Pavel.  I found the book to be extremely helpful to have the photographs reference details of moves like snatches and swings, to ensure correct form.  This dvd set appeals to me because of the basic, no-nonsense instruction. I didn't want all the hype and loud music that tends to go along with some of the other more commercialized trainers out there, because I felt kettlebells to be a little more serious and even dangerous if not done properly.  Other reviews complain about it being boring, but I appreciated the no-frills approach that is demonstrated here.  The instruction is very clear and precise, and the instructor's form is accurate. Most all of the basic kettlebell moves are demonstrated and utilized throughout the 4 dvd's - this is another plus for me.  I did not want to be stuck doing a bunch of aerobic exercises modified to be done holding a kettlebell - I wanted to learn the genuine Russian kettlebell techniques, and I believe this DVD set hits the mark in that regard.  And for the price, you can't beat this 4 dvd set!

Overall, I cannot say enough about the kettlebell, and I wish I had discovered it sooner.  It is as simple as it gets, fits almost anywhere, is basically unbreakable and everything considered a plain iron kettlebell is not too expensive compared to fancy gym machines and memberships. Don't waste your time with the rubber coated or adjustable bells...these simply cost more and do not offer anything different from a normal bell.  You want to develop a good strong grip, so skip the coated handles and let your body adapt to the weights the way it's supposed to.

My background - I am a 30 year old female, and consider myself intermediately fit.  I do a combination of running, interval training and weights and have done so for a few years. I had been specifically doing Les Mills Pump for about a year prior to kettlebells, so felt I was in pretty good shape strength wise.  I started off using an 18lb bell.  After doing the Iron Core workouts for about a month, my strength increased quite a bit, and soon the 18lb bell was too light for just about every move.  I now use a 35 pound bell for swings and deadlifts, and a 26 pound bell for cleans, presses and snatches. I keep my 18lb bell for snatches and presses when I am fatigued. Overall I have made more gains in strength over the last couple months using kettlebells 2-4 times a week than I did with any other weight training method over any amount of time.  I most likely will continue to keep Les Mills Pump in my rotation because I enjoy the barbell work, however I believe kettlebells will be my staple tool from now on.

I highly encourage folks to purchase a set of at least 2 kettlebells of a different weight.  Pick one that you feel moderately comfortable lifing, and then pick the next size up.  I firmly believe practicing with a heavier weight for at least some of your sets/reps will be most beneficial.  Specifically with swings, if you do not go with heavy enough of a weight you will not gain the cardiovascular benefits which come with using a heavy bell.  Remember, kettlebells are designed to be used with your entire body, so once you've learned to make your muscles work together as they were meant to, you'll be surprised with the strength gains you will make!",1357689600,51,3387,4.576158940397351

I just needed another DVD to alternate with the Angie Miller as I don't like to do the same routine 4 times a week so alternating the two breaks up the monotony.  Not to mention the price on Iron Core was superb!

The second two, the boot camp and the longer one, are excellent in a way.  They are tough and have good exercises that are fun, and I like her - she's neither a cheer leader nor is she totally boring, but what I dont' like is that she repeats the same series of exercises four times.  I don't know if that is standard with kettle bells, but other exercise videos and kettle bell videos I've used do only a second round.  I like a bit more variety to keep myself interested.

4685668,5,B005FRWTSO,"This collection of DVDs is really great.  Two of the DVDs are fairly easy workouts that feature a short period of time working with the kettlebell followed by a thirty-second rest.  There are three or four circuits, with a longer rest between each of them.  The other two DVDs feature tougher workouts during which you work for about four or five minutes doing different exercises with the bell, followed by a one minute rest.  I like to pair up one of the easier workouts followed by a more challenging workout.  That allows me to burn a total of somewhere between 425 and 500 calories in a little over an hour.  I work with a 15-pound bell, but will be moving up to a heavier bell before long.  All in all, you canNOT beat the price of these DVDs.

The production values are a bit shaky, but you can see and hear what you need.  The backgrounders aren't necessarily following Sarah, so you are not going to get that precision aerobic feel.

4685670,5,B005FRWTSO,"I think in the time that some of the other reviews have been published, the DVDs have been correctly labeled. My set was fine.

I'll echo the positive statements in the previous review and give a little comparison with the Lauren Brooks Kettlebell app workouts.

Lauren Brooks Kettlebell App:
I really enjoyed the LB app and the workouts are short, fast, and challenging. She also gives great instructions ""keep the shoulders open"" etc that have really helped my Kettlebell form. The workouts on the app are a much faster pace than the Iron Core workouts. This can be both positive if you are short on time, but a negative if you are prone to wanting to keep up with the instructor rather than do a little less but do it properly and with attention to form. Lauren Brooks frequently reminds the viewer that the pacing and number of reps are a suggestion not a rule and to do what you can. The app covers the basic two and one arm swings, suitcase dead lifts, cleans, waiter walks, and some bodyweight only exercises like push ups and plank. Very nice workouts, with a great emphasis on swing variations.

Iron Core
I really appreciated the pacing of the Iron Core DVDs. It was a little slower, the rep range a little shorter and the variety and challenge level of the exercises was excellent. It was less swing intense than the LB app in my opinion (at least the circuits on DVD 2). There are great instructions presented before each exercise. One of the things that will impress you is how strong Sarah Laurie looks- not just slim, but STRONG. As a person focused on fitness, I'm not motivated by wanting to look painfully thin and Sara is a great body-type role model for women that want to actually put on a little lean mass or look more defined. I would caution anybody exercising at home, that these exercises are definitely not just for novices. I've been working with Kettlebells regularly for a few months now (great noticeable results!) and a few presented I wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable doing with my Kettlebell as a clumsy beginner. I used a medicine ball for the deck squats and the Turkish get up to avoid a broken face since I am klutzy. I also practiced each movement with no weight to try to ""feel"" the movement without worrying about resistance. I highly recommend this kind of dry run practice for new athletic activities. It's also a nice dynamic stretch before the actual movement is performed. You can also do the movements with a light dumbbell.

I'm very glad I purchased this, and it is a steal to get 4 excellent DVDS for less than 10.00. I like the very basic, class style presentation (no glam club music and it doesn't look like a Lulumon advertisement).

This is a DVD that can also grow with you from beginner to intermediate and beyond.

A note on form for home exercisers:
 If you feel anything in your lower back, you are doing it wrong. Please don't ignore any signs that your form is incorrect. Get a mirror and check your form. I was surprised to see how I was rounding my back early in my training even though it felt like I was doing things right. Stop if you feel fatigue since that eats away at your form. The Sara Laurie DVD and LB App has rests between sets. Take them. The fresher you come back to a circuit set, the better your form will be. If you can, take a kettlebell class with a certified instructor. I plan to take a few this winter to further refine my technique and form check.",1356652800,33,3439,4.501602564102564

4685672,5,B005FRWTSO,"I am new to kettlebells and while I am enjoying incorporating them into my routine, I am trying to not go overboard and buy up a bunch of DVDs and bells.  I could not however, pass up this 4 DVD set which contains 5 workouts.  Kettlebells the Iron Core Way Volume 1 and 2, Iron Core Warrior and Iron Core Bootcamp.  These appear to have been originally released several years ago, but have been repackaged as a set as the DVDs come in individual sleeves.  The original DVDs appear to be out of print and are quite costly these days, so this set is quite a steal.

Sarah Lurie leads all 4 of these workouts.  For volume 1 and volume 2, she is joined by two background exercisers.  The setting is fairly low budget but it doesn't detract from the workout any.  All of the standard kettlebell exercises are shown here, double arm swings, single and alternating swings, tactical lunges, one arm presses to name a few.  Volume 2 is more advanced than volume 1, volume 2 includes more advanced moves such as snatches, deck squats and turkish get ups but they are both similar in style.  The exercises are accompanied by 30 second rest breaks, which are welcome as some of these exercises really get the heartrate up.

Iron Core Boot Camp and Warrior are clearly more advanced.  Boot Camp is a shorter workout but it's essentially the same circuit repeated four times.  Warrior contains two workouts, one using one kettlebell and the other using double kettlebells.  I see myself advancing to Boot Camp one day, not sure about Warrior though.  It looks quite tough and I need to spend a lot more time with my kettlebells before I get that adventurous.

Sarah Lurie is RKC certified and displays excellent form.  I like her quite well as an instructor and she has also written books on kettlebells, I would say that she knows a lot about the subject.  For those new to kettlebells this would be a great place to start, considering the investment is low but you are still learning from a certified teacher.

One minor issue with the set is that the volume 1 and 2 disks are labeled wrong.  Considering how cheap this set is I am not going to fuss over it.  It really is a good set of workout, albeit a no frills presentation but gets the job done.

4685678,4,B005FRWTSO,"This is my first experience with kettlebells, and in general this seems like a solid set of dvd's. As others mentioned, disc 2 is actually the easiest workout with the most technique instruction. Both 1 and 2 are good workouts, it seems, and they can both be made more difficult with a heavier kettlebell. I haven't done 3 or 4 yet, but I did watch a bit and they seem worthy as well. 4 dvd's for, what, $12? A good deal for sure.

A few items of note: there's no advice anywhere about how heavy a kettlebell to use. I'm sure they are afraid they'll get sued when some type-A hurts himself/herself with an inappropriately heavy weight. After a little research, I started with an 18lb. (I'm a generally strong gal, moderately deconditioned at the moment). It seems light for some exercises, but by the end of a full workout, it seems about right, for now. Dudes will want something heavier, I'm sure.

If you are new to kettlebells like me, there's a bit of a learning curve for some of the exercises, technique-wise. A bit of advice: unless you enjoy mild to moderate bruising/inflammation of the wrist/forearm area, buy some cheapo sweatbands for padding. I did not do this. Mild discomfort during the 1st workout. 2 days later, 18lbs of iron banging repeatedly into already bruised/inflamed flesh a)hurt and b)messed with technique. Now, with aforementioned padding, it's all good. Go ahead, call me a wimp, but last I checked there weren't any awards for suffering needlessly in the name of fitness. Nobody wants to hear you whining about your workout injuries anyway. :)

Lastly, the instructor. Competant, yes. Good at counting, yes. Inspiring, no. On discs 1 and 2, she has a bit of a ""talking to a toddler"" tone of voice, canned cues (""keep going"", ""be aggressive with those hips"", ""keep that back flat""... over and over) with no change in inflection, and then there's this annoying cutesy pose after each exercise. The presentation is very scripted and flat. Not intolerable, but if you prefer more flashy, inspiring instruction you will be disappointed.

I used volume 1 (which is labelled vol 2) this morning and I am beginning to feel the work out.  My only complaint is there are no weight limit suggestions.  I know because of my trainer that I can use 20-30 for swings, lunges, and lat work but I use lighter bells for shoulders and some of the other exercises.

cardio without boredom was why i decided to pursue kettlebell workout and you get exactly that - following one workout or put your own together AFTER learning proper techniques/safety - and you are toned and have gotten cardio at the same time - WITHOUT THE BORING CARDIO SCENARIO as on bikes, treadmill, or elipticals.

Third dvd is the Iron Core Boot Camp , a challenging workout. 4 sets of one arm deadlift/balance combo , cleans, snatch-squat combo, lunges, and swings. 4 sets of swings at the end for abs. 4th dvd has two workouts-  Iron Core Warrior I (one kettlebell) and II (2 kettlebells) ending with variations of Russian twists, even more challenging. We had the kettleworx set but sold it after getting these, prefer Sarah's quiet style and the even flow of these dvd's. Love that she is a strong woman doing real strength and not a skinny minnie jumping around with lighter kettlebells.

Followup (4 months later) : I have gone a bit nuts with other kettlebell DVD's but keep returning to this set, especially the Bootcamp workout, as our favorite. The clustered sets (5 minute clusters with 1 minute rests, repeated 4 times) is a rhythm that i really like and hard to find elsewhere. Most other dvd's offer more interval workouts- 30 seconds on 30 seconds off , for instance. Also, there are not very many double kb workouts out there so I use the Warrior 2 workout a lot also.

Note: I started with a 10 lb kb but am now using 25 lb  KB (I weigh 125 lb) and burn about 10 cals per minute on my HRM for the bootcamp workout including the programmed rests and a short cooldown (done on my own). That's about the same burn rate as running 6.5 miles per hour continuously for me. I use two 20 lb KB's for the double workout and that is QUITE a heart pumper!

Just found out that Sarah was 3 months pregnant when she filmed the Warrior workouts. Yowsa. YOU GO GIRL!",1340236800,256,1658,4.387622149837133
4685688,3,B005FRWTSO,"As a brand new kettlebell user, this was probably the wrong DVD for me to buy.  (That is my fault, though, and not why I'm rating this three stars)  However, just as a warning to other beginners, you need to already know how to do several kettlebell moves - two handed swings, one handed swings, snatches, etc. - in order to make the most of this DVD.  There is no real instruction on how to do these moves, and technique is very important to avoid injury.  It's assumed you already have some experience.

I am rating this three stars mainly for two reasons.  First, the labeling of two of the discs is incorrect, as some reviewers have already noted.  If it hadn't been for them alerting me to this, I would have been quite confused.  In addition, while Sarah Lurie is in great shape and obviously knows what she's doing, I did not find her to be an inspiring instructor.  She is rather wooden in her delivery and I got bored very quickly.  The production values in general are pretty low, so if you are used to somewhat slicker workout DVDs, you might be disappointed.

I did purchase this product at a great price, though, and I'm sure a more knowledgeable kettlebell user could get a great workout using these DVDs.",1339891200,4,1219,4.470588235294118
4685689,5,B005FRWTSO,"This is a great set of DVDs at an excellent price!

That being said, I highly recommend working with a certified Russian kettlebell coach to make sure your form is good.  Plus, a trainer can advise you on which weight you should start out with and a stretching routine for after the workouts.",1338940800,,292,4.490566037735849
4685690,5,B005FRWTSO,I give this DVD set 5 stars!  I love them.  I had already been to a Kettlebell studio and spent 6 weeks learning proper technique when I purchased the set.  These DVDs still showed me some technique mistakes I was making.  Her instructions are very clear and you are able to visually see what to do.  All the other sets I looked at were triple the price.  I was so excited to find a solid set for under $20.  You won't be disappointed.,1337731200,11,435,4.168674698795181
4685691,5,B005FRWTSO,"I ordered these to get me introduced to working out with kettlebells.

The instructor does a good job of explaining the form of the individual exercises.  The workouts are not made for people that are already ripped and just looking to lose those last few pounds.  I know another reviewer stated that Discs 1 and 2 seem to be mixed up and I would have to agree so keep that in mind.  Other than that, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.",1335484800,20,442,4.419753086419753
4685692,5,B005FRWTSO,"I actually thought this series was a mistake.  Four DVD's for less than $18 with free shipping ?  I didn't believe it but it's true.

If these were poor DVD's then any cost would be too much.  In my opinion however, these are hands down the best kettlebell instructional series available.  Most of these kind of exercise series have either a sports jock, or cheerleader-type person acting stupid or babbling on and on, usually with some kind of idiotic commentary.  Sarah Lurie's style is very clear, straightforward and without any hype or grade-school antics.  She tells and shows you exactly how to do an exercise and demonstrates it.  If you want a clear, solid and extremely well done kettlebell series, this is it.  I shouldn't say this, but if it were four times the cost it would still be more than worth it.

My only minor criticism is that the vol. 1 and vol. 2 discs are mislabeled: vol. 1 is actually vol. 2 and vice versa.",1334620800,449,935,4.544910179640719

8470583,5,B005FRWTSO,"Someone warned me that I should only learn to use kettlebells from an in-person instructor; a kettlebell DVD would not provide sufficient instruction to prevent injury.

Throwing caution to the wind, I took a chance on this DVD set.  Why not hurl a heavy object in my basement with low ceilings (Im petite, though), in front of a TV, while being far from an athlete?  What could go wrong?

Turns out, with Sarah Lurie as my virtual coach nothing!  She gives extensive and clear instruction on form, which is key to safely exercising.  Her style is motivating without being demeaning.  If it weren't for the fact that I swing a heavy weight in the air while the DVD is on, Id be very comfortable having my five girls listen to her shes all about promoting strength, health, and proper form.  In other words, Sarah is a fantastic role model for women.

One last note on kettlebells I find that, with a few modifications, this is a very safe and effective way to strengthen your whole body AND get a cardio workout at the same time DESPITE knee problems.  Ive had knee problems for no known reason (no injury, not overweight, etc.) so have always had to be careful.  In the world where HIIT seems to be on everyones lips, this is a fantastic alternative.  While its not the most exciting workout in the world (other than being out in nature, does one exist?) its fast and takes care of your whole self.  A great addition to any fitness routine!

Note: Youll need to add a warm-up and cool down on your own.

This is an amazing value and worth far more than the current price!",1526860800,,1572,4.466666666666667

8470587,1,B005FRWTSO,"For your fitness, health and wellness please do not buy this video!!! I have done Kettlebells off and on for 10 years. I love Kettlebells. I wanted to get a Kettlebell DVD to do in the mornings, just hit play and follow rather, then making my own circuits. I did my research and choose this video because it was affordable, had lots of workouts, and really good reviews. In her first 3 DVDs she executes most of the exercises with improper form, and guides those following in to doing the exercises wrongly and in a way that would cause injury, if not in a few weeks, over time. Her fourth and last DVD, is slightly better with more of her exercises being done correctly. These DVDs are cheap for a reason, you pay money and come away either knowing not to use the workouts or injured from trying them. Kettlebells are a great workout I highly recommend, I have lost weight and gained strength through them. Next time I will be certain to look for someone who is either or both Certified as a Personal Trainer by the American Council on Exercise, or Kettlebell certified by the RKC, not just someone who likes to train and make videos.",1519344000,6,1135,4.461538461538462

8470589,3,B005FRWTSO,"Don't be fooled by 4 DVDs. They could easily have put these on one. The first two are for training purposes. The 1st is just under an hour and the 2nd is about 45 minutes. If you're new to kettlebell, they're both useful and I'd recommend doing them. Sarah Lurie shows you the moves and then there are 3 sets of a series of moves. When you finish each move there is a 30 second break and the next move is described on the screen. This is a good thing. I did jumping jacks, jump ropes, high knees, butt kicks, etc. during each break which gave me a good workout. At the end of the 3rd set she included an ab set which was a nice addition. But they're too boring to go back and do again.

The 3rd DVD includes two 31 minute ""Iron Core Warrior"" workouts. There are 5 moves repeated for 4 sets and then 4 more sets of abs. My only complaint is that each set is the same as the 1st. She puts a minute between each set to get water and ""walk around"" or optional jump squats. I did optional jump squats plus whatever other cardio move I felt like doing -- you're limited only by your capability and imagination. Then there were four 1 minute ab sets. Again the same set repeated 4 times of ""hot potato Russian twists."" That's fine, but it seems like there could be other ab moves instead of same one. Warrior Workout #1 was the best and utilized one kettle bell.

I was not crazy about the Warrior Workout #2 on the 3rd DVD. You need to have two kettlebells of the same weight. I bought one 10 lb. kettlebell to use with a Kelly Coffey-Meyer workout and then decided to get this workout to justify having a kettlebell. So I used two 10 lb. weights with this workout which works fine -- if you've ever done a Jillion Michaels workout you know about renegade rows which are better with hand weights anyway. This was the same formula as the first Warrior Workout but I didn't get as much of a workout because I was fussing with weights and kettle bell to set up for next exercise so didn't get as much of a cardio ""rest"" between sets.  The ab set at the end was once again 4 sets of same moves (2 this time!) regular Russian twists for 30 seconds and hold a plank for 30 seconds with 30 seconds between each set. It was a meh workout. I probably won't do it again.

The final DVD had just one 30 minute workout on it called ""Kettlebell Bootcamp"". It was just okay. She followed the same formula as the warrior workouts. Four sets of 5 moves with 1 minute rests between followed by an ab set.  The ab sets for this one were disappointing because they were just 2 minutes of more kettle bell swings of 20 seconds with 10 second rests between.

I only paid $4.77 so I don't feel too bad about getting this set of DVDs. But I'd recommend to the people who make this to at least combine the training sessions on one DVD and the other 3 workouts on another. You could actually put them all on one with a menu to choose what you'd like (look at Kelly Coffey-Meyer examples).

My other takeaway from this is that I am not interested in buying more kettlebells and I would need to get heavier ones to make this workout challenging enough. Therefore, this is probably a workout I will put on a shelf and not turn to very often -  if at all.",1518652800,,3220,4.182258064516129
