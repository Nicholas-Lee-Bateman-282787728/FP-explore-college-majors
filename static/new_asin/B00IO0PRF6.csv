I think it was made for foreign DVD players.  I did not see anything in the advertisement telling me I would not be able to get it to work in my DVD player.

How can I return it?  If I can view it, please tell me how I can do it with Sony DVD player.",1457654400,,452,3.6666666666666665
8643798,3,B00IO0PRF6,"This film is well made, it is also engaging and it purports to tell the story of Lech Walesa and the rise of the `Solidarity' movement in Communist Poland. To do this we get Lech being interviewed by an Italian journalist and through her questions we go on a tour of the flash points of the past. This starts with the Gdansk shipyard protests in 1970 which were cruelly suppressed by the authorities and killed many people - he was arrested and interrogated.

It documents his struggles and the people he worked with both for and against. We also have his wife and six children and the part they played in his work and life. It is all well acted and directed and the use of archive footage with new work is done extremely well. We follow him all the way through to getting the Nobel Peace Prize and his triumphant visit to Washington DC, with an awful lot of ups and downs in between.

All that aside this has been accused of the being `too official' and basically a hagiography of the man. There is no reference to his work after the fall of Communism - but that is the choice of the film maker and there are no allusions to his collaboration - but we do see him sign documents that he does not read in order to be released from detention.  So as a film it holds up fairly well but it will be seen as propagandist by those who want to see Walesa as the collaborator `Bolek' that he has been accused of and as a reforming hero by others. As such it will cause a polarisation of opinion. I actually enjoyed watching this two hour offering and so as a filmatic experience it does work -as a factual history lesson it is debatable. Either way I would give 7/10 but am rounding down to three stars.",1420934400,,1694,4.271028037383178
