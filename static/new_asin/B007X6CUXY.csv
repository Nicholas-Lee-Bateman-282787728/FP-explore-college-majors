It is worth sitting through for some of the more interesting and entertaining interviews later, though. The trip to the park, and watching and chatting with the street players was particularly interesting. All in all,  this was worth watching, especially if you are interested in Go, China or both.

The disc has some technical issues. It was a DVDr (I knew that when I bought it.) The biggest problem was that I have a fullscreen tv, and instead of letterboxing the image, like normally happens with widescreen DVDs, the sides were cropped, cutting off part of the subtitles. No idea why. As annoying as that was, the disc played properly on the computer, and on the Blu-ray player/widescreen projector at work.

It might also have been cool if someone had proofread the subtitles. And frankly, for the few English-speaking interviewees, it would have been useful if they were also subtitled, as the accents were very hard to understand.

Still, great to see someone making this kind of video!",1336521600,4,1161,4.933333333333334
