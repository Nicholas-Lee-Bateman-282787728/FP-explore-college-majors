988429,5,6305194807,"This Animal Alpabet DVD is the best one i've found so far. I purchased it after reading the review on here.  I have 3 children ages 8,3,and 2.  After watching this dvd my 2&3 yr olds have been saying more of the alphabet and associating it with the animals.. Like A Armadillo, or D dolphin.  I cant get them to stop watching it,and like somone else said, It dosent use the ordinary animals, like q for  quizel .  Even my 8 yr old likes watching the movie. She likes to hear all the details about the animals, and all 3 or them love to sing along with the songs.  I highly recommend this , as i matter of fact i'm going to order another one for my  3yr old neices birthday.",1082073600,8,672,4.083969465648855
988430,5,6305194807,"I have both the animal alphabet and animal numbers.  I do home daycare and the kids just love it. I like the way they did each letter of the alphabet with an animal that starts with that letter. The number video shows different animals and parts of their bodies that go with that number.  They love the singing and also to look at the different animals they have in each video.  I recommend this to any parent who has kids.  I have 3 children of my own ages 1, 3, and 7.  My 7 year old loves it as well.  I guarantee you won't think you wasted your money on these videos!!",1064448000,6,572,4.0625
988431,5,6305194807,"At first I thought the animals the producers picked were sometimes a little off the wall.  However, my 2 and a half year old loves this video so much that she can now easily identify armadillos, bison and hyenas.  We went to a safari park and she started singing ""yak, yak, yak, Y, Y, Y""  My parents couldn't believe she could recognise a yak at such a tender age.  The songwriting is often really corny but the tunes are so catchy I often wake up with ""F is for flamingo"" racing through my head (not always such a good thing I guess!)",1030579200,7,535,4.215686274509804
988432,5,6305194807,"My two children ages 2 and 4 love this video!  It moves through the alphabet singing a song for each letter and choosing an animal that starts with that letter. The tunes are so catchy that I find myself singing them.  We repeat them to each other, too. It's alot of fun. Anyone with little  ones that like animals will love this video.",964742400,11,336,4.301587301587301
988483,5,6305194807,My son who is in medical school learned his ABC's from this video and at the time we got from the library. We have been looking for this for awhile and now we have it,1356998400,,166,3.7714285714285714
988484,5,6305194807,"My 27-month-old is obsessed with animals, so when I received this as a gift when he turned two, I thought it was perfect! Now, having watched it a million times, my son has memorized all the animals that are associated with each letter. Some of the names of the more uncommon animals were hard to understand in the songs (like N is for nudibrank, S is for serval, X is for xenopus), and I had to actually look them up, but overall, this DVD is a great educational tool. If the names of the animals appeared along with the letters, it would be perfect! Everyday in the car, my son and I go through the alphabet and he names off the animals.",1277337600,,639,4.245901639344262
988485,5,6305194807,"Wonderful Video!  I bought this for my son when he was only 1.  He loved it, would sing to the animals at the zoo, and requested ""A for Armadillo"" at Gymboree class.  Now he is almost 7, and will still watch it on occasion when he feels like watching a video before bedtime.

It is a fun introduction to the letters of the alphabet.  Both adults and kids will find it amusing.  The only bad thing about the video is that they don't make it anymore.",1256256000,,448,4.151162790697675
988486,3,6305194807,"Great visuals, catchy songs, unique animals but often hard to understand what animal name is being said! It would've been nice if they had put the name of the animal at the bottom of the screen or a list with the DVD. My kids (6 & 7) kept asking what animal the video was talking about and I honestly couldn't answer for some of them!",1231718400,,334,4.153846153846154
988487,4,6305194807,I ordered this as a christmas gift.  It has turned out to be a great thing!,1229385600,,75,3.6875
988488,5,6305194807,"This is great--all three of my boys LOVED it around ages 2-4.  I just bought a new copy for my 2-year-old and my 8-year-old got excited and experienced nostalgia for the first time.  The songs are great--and not at all offensive  to adult ears (in fact, quite catchy and amusing).  It's only $10--just buy it.",1206576000,,309,4.5636363636363635
988489,5,6305194807,"I have four kids, and they have all loved this video.  The songs are catchy and educational.  Not only do the kids learn the letters, but they learn little tidbits like what makes an insect (6 legs, three body sections) and other fun facts.  The images are bright and colorful and rival anything National Geographic.

The only downside to this show is just how catchy the songs are.  I wake up at two in the morning singing ""Ca-Ca-Ca-Chameleon"".

They started watching around the age of 2.",1188432000,,489,4.627906976744186
988490,5,6305194807,very educational of animals through snappy songs and educational for letter recognition. great for toddler. You may want to consider the animal counting as well. we own both!,1178668800,,174,5.25
988491,5,6305194807,"We originally bought this on VHS for our son and he wore out the tape!!  Now that he is older, we purchased this on DVD for our daughter.  The tunes are catchy and the animals are not the run-of-the-mill choices, normal in ""kids"" movies.  When our son went to pre-school, all the other kids were saying ""D"" is for ""dog"", while he was saying ""D"" is for ""dolphin"".",1174176000,,362,4.294117647058823
988492,4,6305194807,"This video has 26 songs, one for each letter that says something like ""A is for Armadillo"" as the chorus.  My 3-yr old son asks to watch it, although it doesn't hold his attention all of the way to Z....but, as I mentioned he is 3!  I think this is a well done video, the footage is good, the choice of animals is interesting and the songs are cute.",1167782400,,349,4.043478260869565
988533,5,6305194807,"My two year old son loves this video as well as the number video in this series. He knows the difference between a regular monkey and a Gibbon!

He also identifies each animal with its corresponding letter. My five year old daughter loves it too. The animal footage and the music are great.",1163030400,,290,4.471698113207547
988534,5,6305194807,"I checked ""Animal Alphabet"" out from the library once and my [...] LOVED it so much that we had to keep checking it out over and over again.  Finally I found it online and bought the DVD.  They absolutely love the animals and the music.  My husband and I get a chuckle out of the strange animals and lyrics but overall this movie has been a big hit in our family. We learned about nudibranks and armadillos and vipors.... I've ordered this movie as birthday presents for friends and family!",1146441600,,490,4.4222222222222225
988535,5,6305194807,"My son asks for what he calls the ""armadillo DVD"" quite a lot, especially when I refuse to play ""Tom & Jerry"" for the thousandth time.  I like this DVD because it is educational, and it captures my son's attention very well.  He finds the entire DVD fascinating, and he is learning about all sorts of new animals.",1140393600,2,313,4.379310344827586
988536,2,6305194807,I do not like the choices of animals they use for each letter. They use animals that kids have never heard of. Only a few familier ones.,1134432000,3,136,4.074074074074074
988537,4,6305194807,"I don't know how old Jeff Bailey (who provided a wholly negative review) is, but the concensus seems to be that children love this video.  My son is 6 and already knows how to read, but he loves the songs and the video clips of the animals.  It's goofy and corny -- just what kids like.",1132272000,3,286,4.089285714285714
988538,5,6305194807,"I bought this and the numbers version together for my 2 year old to get her started (she loves animals).  The songs are great, the footage is awesome and she enjoys when I sit with her and repeat the names of the animals.  However the reviews lead me to believe they were OK as a first video, since I bought so many numbers and ABCs videos I have to say that for my kid, the best responses have been for those videos that have a lot of repetition. It will be a great song DVD for our car when she is ready to ""review"" what she has learned, and I will definitely NOT be bothered by the songs, they are not at all annoying, the songs are really different from other DVDs and their rhythm varies from song to song.",1126656000,13,711,4.071428571428571
988539,5,6305194807,"All three of my kids (ages 8, 6, 3) love this video.  The animal footage is very interesting and educational.  I enjoy watching it myself.  My 3 yr old is learning all about animals and learning the alphabet at the same time.  My older kids like watching this video too--they like the animal footage and the songs.  There is a new song for each letter of the alphabet and animal.  My boys often sing the songs during the day, such as ""A, a, armadillo...""  They ask to watch this video again and again.  I would highly recommend it.",1125014400,11,531,4.346938775510204
988540,4,6305194807,"If your child loves animals as much as mine does, then they will love this video.  My child already knew his ABCs, but he really enjoys this video - and it is helping him make the connection between letters and objects - reading!  It is fun to watch and it is filled with cute, catchy tunes that we sing a long to.",1122854400,7,314,4.048387096774194
988541,2,6305194807,"Bought this w/other instructional DVD's & this is by far the least interesting any attention catching of them all.  Animals?? one letter per animal & a boring, non-applicable song.  No reciting, just pix and music.

I don't consider this DVD an instructional video at all, look elsewhere (Richard Scary or Sesame Street).",1122595200,5,321,5.134615384615385
988542,1,6305194807,"Geoffrey the Geraph's animal alphabet was done way better & more for kids than this it didn't have ridiculous stuff in it like this one, that makes you think the idiot that made it can't think up rabbit for R rather than rat, what kid wants to sing I'm a dirty rat common now.",1111622400,,276,4.12962962962963

7885142,4,6305194807,"I have 2 young children, that like the movie! A lot of the animals used in the video aren't easy animals for children to say or remember so that makes it harder.",1424304000,,161,4.0625
7885143,5,6305194807,"My family loved this video! Entertaining to watch with catchy songs. They make some unusual animal choices, but we loved that because we got to learn about new animals. Whoever heard of a ""nudibranch"" (sea slug)? Well, now WE have! Highly recommend this video, especially if your children love animals!",1413763200,,302,5.06

7885145,5,6305194807,"First saw this video some 16 yrs ago while babysitting for a friend.  It was her 3yr olds favorite video, and he was singing along, knew all the animals and letters.  Wasn't long before I was hooked too.  Now I'm a grandma, and I never forgot this video.  Excellent.  Kids love it and it's so much fun adults don't mind hearing it over and over and over again : )  Going to buy another copy for my house, and for a friends grandson, and for....",1404950400,,444,4.1647058823529415
7885146,5,6305194807,My grandchildren loved watching this and learning the songs.  It was great too that the animals that were picked to represent the letters of the alphabet were not necessarily the ones you would expect.,1389657600,,201,4.911764705882353
7885147,5,6305194807,"Animal Alphabet: Learning Your ABCs with Animals is a fun video that your kids will surely enjoy.  We got this video for my daughter and son and they loved it.  The animals in the video are super cute.  I would definitely recommend this video.

Thank you for reading my review.",1385164800,,277,4.48
7885148,5,6305194807,"I had the VCR version of this and raised my granddaughters on it. They loved it. Now that I watch my great-granddaughter, I wanted her to have the same learning experience. The old VCR tape was watched so many times and so old that the tape broke. It was time to upgrade to the DVD. I was so happy to find it on line and available for purchase. Same great video in a new format for a new generation.",1383523200,2,399,4.063291139240507
