1964951,5,B00011HIVM,"My five year old son thinks this video is the greatest. The title song is familiar to him, but he is also loving the new songs, especially ""Fill it Up"". He giggles out loud every time the the mouse appears on the bus, and he also gets a big kick out of the wonderful footage of animals from a zoo, a farm and the aquarium. All in all a great video he is learning a lot from, while I have time to cook dinner!",1071532800,2,408,3.869047619047619
1964952,5,B00011HIVM,"Watch this and you'll be humming afterwards!  It's obviously geared to kids the age that would be singing ""The Wheels On The Bus"" (that's from birth on) and there's a fun new song ""Fill Her Up."" Roger Daltrey's great as the voice of the dragon bus driver and the mix of live action and animation is a treat. You can learn to spell ""alpaca"" and count the floating fish. It's just a great fun video!",1070150400,10,397,4.293333333333333
1964953,4,B00011HIVM,"My 5 year old son has enjoyed this video since he was a baby, and his 1 1/2 year old baby sister loves it - EXCEPT for the circus segment with the clown!  For whatever reason, she is terrified of that seemingly innocuous portion of the video and we have to skip it every time.  Aside from this inexplicable horror, this is indeed a cute video that tells the story of two animals and their bus ride search to find their home.  Oddly enough, the bus driver is played by Roger Daltrey of rock legends The Who - how he got this gig I do not know, but he applies himself admirably to the role.  The video features fun songs (that get stuck in your head), the production values are good, and it has a good variety of educational themes for little ones.  Great fun for babies, toddlers, and preschoolers - unless they have clown issues!!!
***8/6/11 My daughter is 2 1/2 now and no longer fears the clown.  The kids watched this in the car during a recent road trip and she actually demanded that we skip to the circus part - the same part that used to terrify her.  Go figure!",1293580800,,1069,4.236453201970443
1964954,5,B00011HIVM,"Bought this for my grandson who was 27 months old.  He had seen on YouTube several versions of the wheels on the bus.  Daltrey was his favorite, so nana bought it.  He watched this over and over, always pointing out different features, correcting words and noticing versus that he knew but were not on the video.  After several viewings we were making up our own verses.  He still sits and watches this video and at times has it playing while he is playing with other things.  Great video and well worth the money.",1266019200,,514,4.473118279569892
1964955,5,B00011HIVM,"The content in this particular DVD was remarkable... the makers made sure to use every minute as an opportunity to teach. I loved that they went to Long Beach Aquarium, the LA Zoo, and even managed to squeeze in a lesson in healthy eating! This movie is loads of fun and so far the best movie I have purchased for my son. I am so glad programs like this exist to enrich my son and prefer it to the mindless babble on television these days. Please try at least of these DVD's... you will not be sorry!",1263168000,,500,4.164948453608248
1964956,5,B00011HIVM,"My 1 year old Daughter loves the constant music in this video.  Lots of puppet action too.  I thought this may be a bit old for her, but turns out that it wasen't.  If you have a child who likes music, and movement this one is great!",1249776000,,233,3.9148936170212765
1964957,4,B00011HIVM,"I had seen this video on utube and my 1.5 years old son used to watch the video many times each day. So decided to buy this so that my comp remains free. It's been 8 months since got this DVD and he still likes it.
It's good - fun & learning combined together.",1237680000,,260,3.8333333333333335

this all the time. I bought the other two cds of the same series.",1221782400,,125,3.8461538461538463
1964959,5,B00011HIVM,"This is just a godsend DVD. We bought it when our daughter was 16 months old and she's now 20 mos, and still loves it. Good for keeping her occupied, feeding and play time when all else fails. Little ones love to mimic the actions of the characters on the dvd, and dance/play along.
I bought this on a whim and have now bought the second dvd on the series.
Very baby/kid-friendly, and has pleasing, music all through the dvd and some great wildlife and outdoor captures. This probably has the best music of all 3 dvds.",1212019200,,518,4.350515463917525
1964960,5,B00011HIVM,This was recommended to me!  I am so happy it was too!  This is a perfect video for children 3 months +!  I started giving it to expectant mothers.  It will be your savior on cranky days and the best sing-a-long at any time.  Kids become addicted.  Mango and Papaya are definitely favorites in our home!,1207526400,,303,4.321428571428571
1964961,5,B00011HIVM,"We bought this video for our 18 month old from a recommendation from my sister-her daughter loves it. We've bought our son the Baby Einstein dvd's and the Elmo's World ones, however this is by far his favorite dvd, he wants to watch it every day.  We highly recommend this DVD for your little one, the songs are extremely catchy, the characters are fun and the video is full of bright wonderful colors. Definitely a must own.",1203292800,,425,4.51948051948052
1964962,5,B00011HIVM,"I love this series!  The kids love the music, the puppets, the animals. It teaches kindness and good manners and the children want to watch it over and over again. What more could you want?  Thank you!",1203206400,,201,4.405405405405405
1964963,5,B00011HIVM,this is a great dvd I found for my one year old who loves the song wheels on the bus. Really nice songs and characters. It just long enough.,1199664000,,140,3.8620689655172415
1964964,5,B00011HIVM,I bought this DVD to entertain my 18 month old twin girls on a 3 hour flight. They loved it. It helped to make for a pleasant trip. When we got home they again wanted to see this video. They can't get enough of it. They love to sing the songs. We have the CD and use it in the car. It is great!,1184716800,,294,3.609375
1964965,5,B00011HIVM,"My son is 20 months & loves this dvd. I got it from the library some wks back  since he really likes the song. He was hooked on it the minute it started . I have not seen him enjoy anything on tv as much as this. He asked for it everyday & missed it when I had to return it. So I went online & ordered both the 1st & 2nd for him. He knows all the animals & the fish, he happily shouts out their names when he sees them, he loves the songs & would watch it over & over again if we let him! He does not usually sit in 1 place for more than 15 mins so we were pleasantly surprised. He remembers & asks for specific sounds like fish - glub, or cat - meaow, when I sing the song for him. I must say I like all the songs too esp fill it up.",1184630400,,734,3.559006211180124
1964966,5,B00011HIVM,"This is really an EXCELLENT DVD! Very EDUCATIONAL, WHOLESOME, FUN and ENJOYABLE! You can't help to watch it and enjoy it yourself too! (At least, the first few times . . .)

My two-year-old nephew COMPLETELY FELL IN LOVE with the CD when we introduced it to him when he was one. We got him the DVD for Christmas and he IMMEDIATELY LOVED it. But then eventually we HAD to get the Second Volume, just so that we wouldn't lose our sanity from having to watch the First one over and over again, every single day! . . . (Believe me, we literally had to hide it!)

I don't think you'll regret buying this DVD. Kids REALLY enjoy it and in addition, they get to learn important values. I already got more copies for the other kids in our family and now we're waiting for the THIRD Volume, which we tried to get my nephew for his second birthday, but it wasn't out yet. We've all been waiting!",1184025600,,884,4.255952380952381
1964967,5,B00011HIVM,"Hands down, without question, the finest video in my kids' collection.  This video has been playing strong in our house for almost 2 years now.  My son started when he was 1 and now we have a 1 1/2 daughter that loves it just as much him.  And the other parents are right, this video is not only adicting to children, but i catch myself singing and watching the video every time i put it on for my kids.  it is so fun to play and sing with them to this video...they abosulely love it!",1181606400,,484,4.063157894736842
1964968,5,B00011HIVM,"I did a search one day for the wheels on the bus song on my pc when my 1 year old was crabby... I found the previews and watched with him and he was hooked.  I just bought the DVD and my entire family is now singing fill it up, and the others songs in the movie.  It's kind of cool to see Roger Daltrey, since I saw him on the first farewell tour with the Who in 1989.  When my wife found out there was a second video, she asked me why we don't have it too... I'm getting it today.  Really god stuff for all the kids...you'll be singing too!",1173312000,,541,3.8035714285714284
1964969,5,B00011HIVM,"My four-year-old loves this video. He's very active and not really into sitting in front of the TV, but this is one he asks for over and over again from the moment he gets home from pre-school. He and even his six-year-old brother have had lots of laughs watching it. Roger Daltry is the voice of the bus-driving dragon, and the video teaches more than just what you might find on the bus.  It takes viewers to an aquarium and a zoo and also does a piece about nutrition as well.  Also, on the bonus features, there's a ""making of"" video that my kids really enjoyed. We actually borrowed it originally from our local library and renewed it to the renewing limit.",1169424000,,662,4.418032786885246
1964970,4,B00011HIVM,Ordered this video for my granddaughter's birthday.  She loved it.  It's a song that she is learning at daycare and she was so proud that she could sing along.  I reccomend this video for toddlers.,1167782400,,197,4.571428571428571
1964971,5,B00011HIVM,"Our toddler lit up when she saw this for the first time. Clever lyrics, arrangements and vocals introduce the youngsters to swing, jazz, a little rap and I swear a country western guitar. The musicians are having fun and the actors are feeding off it. We bought the CD too and the commute to daycare has become a happy ritual.",1157155200,,326,4.45
1964972,5,B00011HIVM,"As everyone else has said this is a great DVD! My son that just turned two loves it! He laughs a lot during this DVD!

The bus stops at different places to try to help Mango and Papaya find their home. Some of the stops are the Aquarium of the Pacific, a farm and finally the LA Zoo.  They make other stops on the way like to get gas.  My little guy loves the animals at the aquarium--especially the sharks! He can even say ""jelly fish"" now.

He laughs when the bus goes over bumps, when the people on the bus go ""Ha, ha, ha"" laughing, when the fish are swimming on the bus and when there are bubbles floating around on the bus.

Nice change of pace from his other favorites like Little Einstein and Zoboomafoo.",1156464000,2,711,4.160583941605839
1964973,5,B00011HIVM,"we got this dvd as a gift and we put it in when my son was about 9 mths old. he is now 28 mths old and we have worn it out! no amount of cleaning or praying will help! as an adult, it isn't as bad as some of the stuff out there, so that is why i am willing to replace it. if you like hearing 'the wheels on the bus' at home, in the car, at the store, in the middle of church and in your sleep...this is the movie for you!",1142899200,,421,3.442105263157895
1964974,5,B00011HIVM,My little one age 20 months loves the songs and the movements made in time to the songs! One of the best-adults will find themselves singing along also.  Has all the words to songs included. Keep the 1-2's interest.  Highly recommend!,1141603200,3,234,4.682926829268292
1964975,5,B00011HIVM,"My 20 mo son will not watch ANYTHING on tv. We have tried the Wiggles, Barney, Sesame Street, Baby Einstein series etc... and he has absolutely no interest! This video is the only thing he has ever watched. He has become obsessed with it and is contantly asking for ""bus."" It has great upbeat music, interesting characters, animals, and a very engaging story line for kids. It is absolutely wonderful. I cannot recommend it more highly!! The best video purchase ever. Even my 4 yr old daughter likes to watch it with him!! You won't be disappointed.",1141430400,,549,4.670103092783505
1964976,5,B00011HIVM,"This children's video is amazing. I teach students with autism and this is the ONE movie that I can put on and all of them have complete attention on the screen. My students learn from music and I have actually been able to generalize the skillls taught in the movie (nutrition, safety) and teach them in the class because they have memorized the songs. I would highly recommend this movie to parents with children with special needs. It is extremely visual with bright colors and animated characters that keep the children interested, while LEARNING :o)  Yeah, I couldn't ask for anything more!!!!",1133568000,5,598,4.862745098039215
1964977,5,B00011HIVM,"I bought this video because it had gotten such great reviews on amazon.com and thought that it would be nice to add to our children's video collection.  My daughter is 2 and can't see this video enough times.  She says ""monkey bus over again please OK"".  We have to tell her no more after 2 or 3 times in a row.  I catch myself humming the original songs ""Everybody on the Bus is Going Somewhere"" and ""Fill it Up"" while I'm at work.  It's catchy, a bit cheesy in the production values, but it's definitely my daughter's favorite thing to watch.  I would highly recommend it.",1110240000,3,574,4.367924528301887
1964978,5,B00011HIVM,"I am so happy we found this video! Our daughter, 16 months, loves it. She will move her arms like the wheels on the bus to let me know she wants to watch it (which is daily). She has also learned how to say ""sh-sh-sh"" with her finger to her lips and so many other things. The locations that they visit are perfect for early learning and the songs are fun to sing. Highly reccomended!!!!",1088467200,4,386,4.16
1964979,5,B00011HIVM,"My sister gave us this dvd as a gift for our 2 1/2 yr old daughter.  She absolutley loves this!  She sings and dances to it with such enthusiasm.  How refreshing to have a video worthy of our child's attention! She even asked us to take her on a bus so that she could sing with a monkey!!!  This video encourages speach development in a musical manner.  The characters are endearing and mesmerizing.  This has actually surpassed the Baby Einstein videos, as far as I am concerned!  I look forward to more to come!",1082419200,4,513,4.3936170212765955
1964980,5,B00011HIVM,"Our 18 month old screams for the ""Bus Video.""  We play it everyday and find ourselves singing to it when it's not on.  We've given this DVD to our friends and family with kids from 6 months to 6 years old - everyone loves it!",1082246400,2,225,3.977777777777778
1964981,5,B00011HIVM,"The sweet songs and gentle characters on the Wheels on the Bus Video keep my kids entertained, even after 15+ viewings.  I got this as a Christmas gift and it has really passed my test as a mother of young children.  I hope they make a sequel to it.
My oldest, 8, likes the songs.  My 5 year old enjoys seeing the Pacific Aquarium sealife.  The four year old and 2 and a half year old really enjoy both the farm as well as the  party sequences.  Even my 18 month old son climbs into a chair to watch the whole story of how Mango and Papaya ride the bus in search of their home.
The 33 minute time length is perfect for helping a busy mom finish short tasks while avoiding an hour an a half feature length interruption to a toddler's day.
No coarse language or rap music.  Characters are all polite and exhibit good manners.  And the whole thing is done with gentle fun suitable for even the youngest viewer.  This is a good, safe video for little ones.",1074643200,3,952,4.186813186813187

8005172,4,B00011HIVM,"My son is in LOVE with this show. He'll be 2 soon. He started watching this less than a month ago. He asks to watch it every. Single. Day. All 3 videos are on Netflix.

FYI - - I hate this show. The music is so obnoxious- I'm not even that picky. Every adult I know that's seen this thinks the same. If you don't let your kids watch or play with certain things for the sake of your sanity, you're going to want to skip these. The songs stick in your head so you will be singing them in your sleep and the characters are nauseating. I didn't review based on adult appeal though.",1352419200,,577,4.017391304347826

We began using it in the past couple months (our house was on the market and we faced a cross country move) with my 9 month old son, and he is completely entranced with it.  It is the perfect length to get a few things done and quite catchy,  My husband, mom and I constantly joke about the lyrics, character, etc.  We love that the dragon is Roger Daltrey!  It is great, truly a lifesaver for this family!  We are literally watching it daily right now as we live in a tiny hotel room in the midst of our move and completely appreciate it!",1317427200,,668,4.061068702290076
