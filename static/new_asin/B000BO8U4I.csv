8090058,4,B000BO8U4I,"Ernie Lovacs has two young daughters who are abducted by his former, somewhat erractic wife.  While his career moves forward, Kovacs
searches for his beloved youngsters.  The final scene in the drama is memorable and thoroughly moving.  Kovans real-life widow (he was
filled in an automobile accident in 1961), Edie Adams, appears briefly in the film (as believe it ot not), Mae West.  Watch for it!",1425772800,,399,5.0
8090059,4,B000BO8U4I,"An interesting piece of entertainment history most people don't know
about Ernie Kovacs.  Too bad they did not continue because Edie Adams, his wife,
raised his daughters after he was killed in an auto accident.  She also paid off all
his debts.",1369180800,,245,4.809523809523809
8090060,5,B000BO8U4I,"I remember seeing this film when it premiered on tv and I enjoyed it then because it starred two actors whose work I've admired, Jeff Goldblum and Melody Anderson, as well as being about Ernie Kovacs.  A comedian whose work I had heard of and I thought this film gave me a good idea of why.  While the film lacked some accuracies I still enjoyed it.",1264896000,3,349,4.2727272727272725
8090061,4,B000BO8U4I,"Jeff golblum does an excellent job playing the title in the film.the films about a hollywood  legend whos wife kidnaps his children and he must do whatever it takes to find them. Well acting job by everybody. Cloris Leachman in an emmy winning performance. Also, Soleil Moon Frye who is in the last ten minutes of the film is charming and probably will make you cry. I thin she was only 7 or so, around that young age. Just a great film.",1000684800,8,437,4.329268292682927
