The film ""Yuma"" is outstanding. If  you are a Clint Walker fan, he is in his element, and really shines in this movie.  You will not be disappointed.  The picture quality is good for the era. The story line is believable and holds your interest.  Barry Sullivan as the Army officer is very good, though he surely looks small next to The Big Guy. Morgan Woodward is excellent, as always. Kathryn Hays gave a very stiff performance as a  prideful young woman playing hard to get.  If the plot had been true to character, a man like Marshal Harman clearly would not be interested in such an aloof woman.
The ending was rather abrupt and needed some good old Cheyenne Bodie romance. For some reason Walker never did any loves scenes in anything but his TV series ""Cheyenne"" and they were few and far between there.  Even in ""Fort Dobbs"" and ""Yellowstone Kelly"" where the script(s) virtually screamed for a good love scene, there were none.

""The Proud and The Damned"" is awful in every way. It is easy to see why they packaged these two films packaged together.  No one would want the ""Proud and Damned"".  I am a Chuck Connors fan but this movie is a blot on his career.  He has played a villain before (""The Big Country"", among others) but he was bland in this film.  Further,the rest of the cast was also boring and predictable. The movie is loaded with profanity and blasphemy--apparently the director was not talented enough to realize that actors actually can portray 'real' men without profanity. He was also not experienced enough to know that blasphemy will offend a large part of the viewing audience. Further, an actor as well known as Connors was well established enough to refuse to allow profanity to substitute for good acting.  Actors do have sway with most directors [unless the directors are stubborn egomaniacs like John Ford].
The potential buyers are strongly advised to purchase ""Yuma"" separately.  [You can find it for a good price separately].",1298246400,,2026,4.667605633802817
8322619,1,B001MZVZHO,I would not buy this product or any other DVD made by Timeless Media Group. Very poor quality. They spent more on the metal box then on the movie.,1291075200,2,146,4.068965517241379
