7959468,5,B000063K12,"GURU, THE MAD MONK is another omni-schlock offering from Director, Andy Milligan (THE RATS ARE COMING THE WEREWOLVES ARE HERE). The story is about Father Guru (Neil Flanagan), a monk who needs dead bodies for his experiments. Luckily, he has a man who works at the local prison, and there are plenty of executions to supply the required subjects. All of the requisite Milligan film elements are present, including- grade school-level, constipated ""acting"", ding-a-ling dialogue, petrified pacing, thrift store costumes, a nonsensical ""plot"", and sub-home movie filming techniques. The torture / death scenes are particularly rib-tickling! Father Guru himself is a living absurdity, complete w/ Wal-Mart wig and paper pope suit! His talk w/ himself in the mirror, is a miracle of idiot cinema! Thankfully, this movie is nowhere near as brain-puncturing-ly dull as THE RATS ARE..., and benefits greatly from its own vast ineptitude! This makes GURU a laugh-out-loud classic! The preposterous hunchback -Igor, of course- is the best sidekick since MANOS' Torgo! The way he just sort of bobbles along is almost musical! There's also a cranky vampire lady, named Olga! she spends her time running around in some leftover Star Trek head-dress, apparently made from curtains and old pot holders! Oh, happy day! As utter stink-burgers go, this one's up there w/ the most horrendous ever conceived! Nothing can possibly prepare you for the dunderheaded, bell-ringing finale! Amen...",1497225600,,1473,5.380952380952381
7959469,4,B000063K12,"Grade-B hilarity. As one reviewer mentioned, while the setting is medieval times, there is traffic noise in the background and modern trash on the streets. Additionally, I noticed standpipes and aluminum downspouts on the building. Lastly, the sign with the name of the church is a piece of printed cardboard hastily pasted on whatever the actual name of the church was. On balance, any movie with a one-eyed hunchback must have something going for it.",1482537600,,452,5.04
7959470,1,B000063K12,"I am not sure of the time period. It is supposed to be 15th century, but in one scene a motor bike is in the background. An island is set up to punish bad sinners and is run by the Mad Monk (Neil Flanagan). There is a story about a woman stolen by gypsies, then escaped with her dead baby or something. The restoration was bad as was the sound, story and acting. Supposed to be a cult classic, I think it is just a stinker. Yes, it did have the Milligan hunchback character.",1448236800,2,474,4.053191489361702
7959471,3,B000063K12,"Andy Milligan's films are uniquely terrible, in a way that Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films never began to approach. Whereas Wood never had an idea in his head except his dream of being a director, Milligan had twisted, convoluted ideas that made Pasolini look like Walt Disney. Warped by his profoundly bitter experiences with his abusive mother, and further deranged by his drug-addled Bohemian New York milieu, Milligan strove to make important films denouncing the corruption of society. Unfortunately, he had neither the budgets nor the patience to make anything good. What he did have was a ""genius"" for horror stories every bit as loopy as Wood's, as well as a pronounced taste for sadism. Add to that his ugly camerawork, inaudible sound, and performances that ranged between the hammy and the catatonic, and you have films that could appeal only to the most hardcore aficionados of cinematic cheese.

""Guru, the Mad Monk"" tells the story of the title character, a schizophrenic 15th-century priest whose bloody misrule turns the island of Mortavia into a living hell. Neil Flanagan, a Milligan regular, is terrible as Father Guru, though not as bad as Jaqueline Wood as Olga, Guru's vampire mistress, or Paul Lieber as Carl, an innocent forced to do Guru's bidding. (After seeing Lieber's flat, disengaged performance, it is amazing to learn that he actually went on to a long and reasonably successful career, mostly in live theater and TV.) The best thing you can say about ""Guru, the Mad Monk"" is that it's short--only 57 minutes. The print quality, as other reviewers have noted, is abysmal. However, this DVD includes a fascinating interview with Tom Vozza, a still photographer who worked with Milligan on his last two films. As Vozza notes, he is one of the few living people who can discuss Milligan's working methods, most of his other cast and crew members having OD'ed long ago.",1391385600,,1892,4.968454258675079
7959472,5,B000063K12,"20th century litter blowing around the grounds of the ""medieval"" setting.  The sound of Manhattan traffic can be heard beneath the tacked on sound effects of sea birds.  Modern scissors used as weapons and store nannequin hands used as severed human hands.  And flower power bed sheets used as curtains.  Add to this the bad acting, trademark hunchback and hate filled characters screaming at each other and you have classic Andy Milligan.",1189468800,3,439,5.055555555555555
7959473,5,B000063K12,"without going into the story line, as it's already been posted i think it note worthy to mention that as far as ""bad films"" go, Milligan was a master. the films he made (that are available) are classics of trash cinema.

i enjoy his work much more than Ed Wood's simply because his work is more interesting. Wood tends to be laughably dumb (with glen or glenda? the exception), but Milligan is so eccentric and morbid that his films can have a considerable effect.

Guru, The Mad Monk is like a morbid fairy tale for adults. the film is blasphemous and all over all nutty. in particulaur, the scene where guru does a monologue with his mirror image to suggest for that one particulaur moment in the film that he suffers from a split personality disorder. then there's the retarded hunchback (cause you gotta have an egor thrown in for good measure) who dribbles and drools all over the girl held captive by guru. the ""actor"" sounds like he's on meth as he babbles and babbles and babbles. but crazy above all is olga, who is guru's vampire hench-woman. this lady is truly batty.

in watching Guru again i will have to remember to make note of how many times people ask eachothers names. seriously, it seems like each character asks at least three or four times each. any way, if you like bad movies and especially wierd movies then go for Guru. and if you like that then check out body beneath (my personal fav.) and a real lame brain zinger called Monstrosity, which is one of Milligan's last films before his death from aids. i'm still going through the films myself but those i would suggest. also, check out Milligan's biography by jimmy mcdonough. i just got it and so far i can say it is awsome. now get Guru you idiot. oh, and by the way, ""what is your name?""",1119225600,3,1766,4.461300309597523
7959474,2,B000063K12,"The DVD version of Andy Milligan's GURU, THE MAD MONK is definitely not GURU-vy. While it's commendable that the anti-Master's films are becoming available on DVD, a certain amount of respect must be paid to consumers when coming up with good source materials. Granted, Milligan's features were never visually arresting, but the print used for the DVD is a worn, battered 35mm blowup from 16mm print. A gray market version of the film I have in my collection is vastly superior, time code at the bottom and all.
The one improvement appears to be in sound quality. You can hear Neal Flannagan's pointy bishop hat crinkle like the hasty paper creation it actually is! A fun 17-minute documentary with set photographer Thomas Vozza (who worked with Milligan on MONSTROSITY and WEIRDO) is included.",1019001600,8,794,4.977443609022556
