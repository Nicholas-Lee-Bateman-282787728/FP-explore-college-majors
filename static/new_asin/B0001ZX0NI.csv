2047378,4,B0001ZX0NI,"When Bob Champion (John Hurt), one of England's most successful jockeys, is diagnosed with cancer given only months to live, the winner never quits: He beats the odds and sets out to win the Grand National Steeplechase in 1981 on the back of his trusty jumper, Aldaniti (played by Aldaniti himself). John Hurt is he usual magnificent self, giving a truly authentic performance that doesn't feel like one. Based on the memoir by Bob Champion.

2047396,5,B0001ZX0NI,"I love John Hurt as an actor and had this on VHS. Between his mount's physical problems and Mr. Champions battle with cancer you really wonder if both are going to be victorious over them.  It's a long movie, but being it's a true story, and seeing the amazing ending, you'll be cheering just as I was!",1398729600,,302,4.298245614035087

2047399,1,B0001ZX0NI,"it was more about the jockey than the horse, or racing.  I love the horse stories,  ie Secretariat and Seabiscuit. However the service you provide is always great.",1386892800,,163,4.785714285714286
2047400,4,B0001ZX0NI,Good movie about overcoming hardships.  I have always loved John Hurt and he gives his usual excellent performance in this movie.,1383523200,,129,5.142857142857143
2047401,5,B0001ZX0NI,"Love this DVD based on real people and events - even the horse, Aldaniti, plays himself in this movie.  When I want to be uplifted, I watch this movie.",1372723200,,151,4.206896551724138
2047402,4,B0001ZX0NI,"I especially loved the scenes of the rider and horse that started this movie, was featured now and then during it then played again at the end.  To me the horse was the true star of this movie and they should have shown more about his recovery - a sort of parallel to the story of the man recovering.  This is a very good feel good story of great courage and the will to live.  I always thought the woman he married had been his physical therapist or something but apparently not. I never did figure out exactly how she came into the story so I guess I'll look at the movie again.  Hurt just looked terrible most of the time and he may have simply been too old for the part when cast.  But, I like him very much and enjoyed his performance.",1368403200,,740,4.111111111111111
2047403,5,B0001ZX0NI,"This is a fabulous movie. The true story of a man who won a fight against cancer and a horse that was nursed from lameness. These unlikely individuals came together to win the greatest horse race on Earth; The Grand National. Their story is told with grace and dignity. The direction, production and photography are superb. The photography of the horses and riders is particularly spellbinding. This is a 'makes you feel good' movie. A refreshing reminder that a good film can still be made without loud noises, computer animation and pyrotechnics.
One reviewer mentioned that it wasn't as good as the book. In most cases it's almost impossible for a movie to capture every nuance of the written word so simply recognize the as a great piece of art in its own right.",1360540800,,766,4.723880597014926
2047424,5,B0001ZX0NI,"I first saw this movie years ago.  Have it on VHS, replaced it with the DVD.  TRUE, heart rending story. A real tear jerker.",1354924800,,124,4.125

2047426,5,B0001ZX0NI,"The racing scenes are breathtaking. Amazing camera work (made before the computer took over). John Hurt is great and totally believeable in all aspects of his role. A great, but not well known, film. Wonderful - if you are not stirred by this film, you do not have a pulse.",1354060800,,273,4.48
2047427,5,B0001ZX0NI,A great story with great acting. A must see. A movie you will watch more than once. Get the popcorn and enjoy.,1333929600,,110,4.045454545454546
2047428,5,B0001ZX0NI,"This is the story of a great jockey and horse that survived great adversity.  As the jockey is over coming his fight with cancer, the horse is recovering from an injury also.  The style of showing them recover side by side really helps to show what can be done to recover if you have the desire.  This can be watched by all ages.",1333584000,,329,4.190476190476191
2047429,5,B0001ZX0NI,"Firstly, sure - a couple of the acting performances are a bit wooden. And, yes, turning a book in to a film will always be a 'hatchet job'. I read the book after the film and felt that the most important fact about the screenplay is that it's as faithful to the book as it could be while holding the viewer's attention right to the end.

The story is not about Bob Champion *only*. It's called 'Champions'. It's about Bob Champion *and* the great Aldaniti (who plays himself in the film). It's about having absolutely nothing left except a small glimmer of hope and holding on to that dream while all the circumstances around you point in a different conclusion to your life.

But it's *true*. Not 'based on' a true story. This one happened as closely to the events as they could make it. And filmed very close to the time when the events actually took place.

One final point - the opening titles soundtrack is magnificent and gets me tearful before the film even starts every time I watch it...",1327104000,,996,4.461538461538462
2047430,5,B0001ZX0NI,Fabulous true story of 2 champions - jockey Bob Champion overcame cancer and its treatments and Aldaniti overcame soft tissue damage to pair up to win the Grand National - love the real race footage and the fact the horse plays himself -,1321747200,,237,4.534883720930233
2047431,5,B0001ZX0NI,"As a former cancer patient I wondered whether I wanted to watch a depiction of someone undergoing chemotherapy.  But I'm so glad I did.

John Hurt as Bob Champion is brilliant.  You feel his pain, bewilderment at the diagnosis and his determination to get back to the thing he loves the most .... being a jockey.  It's nice to see gentle Ben Johnson in another movie.  And the beautiful Kirstie Alley.  AND the amazing Edward Woodward.  Fans of British television will recognize many talented faces.

Bob Champion's story serves as inspiration for anyone facing a difficult time, whether it be an illness, job loss or any one of life's challenges.  While convalescing at his sister's farm Bob rides his niece's pony.  He's so weak he falls off when the pony stops but oh, the joy on his face as he rode and taught that little pony to jump. There is joy in the journey to getting better.

This is a wonderful film.  I'm so glad the DVD was released in North American format.

A note for younger viewers:  The scenes of the Grand National race are heart stopping.  This is a very dangerous sport for rider and horse.  However for those watching with young children didn't fear gory scenes.  There's a little bit of nudity.  Kirstie Alley and John Hurt are seen cuddling up naked but it's not graphic and they are well covered by a blanket.  It's in this scene that Kirstie's character expresses concern about a swelling on her lover's testicle. In another scene Kirstie gives John a massage and you see a bit of his bottom from the side.  Again, not graphic.",1321574400,,1556,4.589090909090909
2047432,5,B0001ZX0NI,i loved this movie when it was first released and though it is a little dated now is still absolutely brilliant. Worth the money spent,1306800000,,134,4.4
2047433,5,B0001ZX0NI,"This is a true story of a steeplechase horse and his jockey overcoming serious illness (cancer) and injury (tendon rupture) to win the most challenging race in the world, the Grand National Steeplechase. It is a film that even stars the actual horse that won that race, Aldaniti. A true story of courage, human snd equine, that overcomes the most serious of adversities. Truly a tale of supreme triumph.",1300924800,,403,4.855072463768116
2047469,4,B0001ZX0NI,"Broken down horse (tendon trouble which most horsemen consider the kiss of death in a performance horse). Broken down jockey (lung cancer, which would appear to be a similar kiss of death for a rider). They both heal, slowly, not without set backs and doubts. Then, together they win the Grand National (think National Velvet-yes, that race).",1298419200,2,342,5.017543859649122
2047470,5,B0001ZX0NI,As a horsewoman most movies about horses are either too silly or too saccharine sweet to be enjoyed. This is different; it is a true story and Aldaniti appears as himself in it - how wonderful to see him! The final race scene is very exciting even though we know the outcome.,1268784000,2,275,4.3076923076923075
2047471,5,B0001ZX0NI,"""Champions"" came on one night when I was very ill on chemotherapy in 1984. The story of Bob Champion and the magnificent Aldaniti became one of my favorites forever. I sent away for the VHS tape and when it came, I watched it over and over for it gave me hope and as you can see, I am still here. John Hurt, one of the finest actors of his time, is absolutely wonderful as Bob. Nobody else could have played the part with such realism and depth and if you plan to see this movie, you may as well prepare yourself. You will see the results of cancer treatments in all their grim reality; depressing, lonely, painful and hard. You will also find yourself cheering on the two heroes of this great true tale. Your heart will pound out of your chest to see the the Grand National steeplechase action, you just won't believe the scenes! If you only watch it because you love horses, you will still  love this movie.  I also highly recommend ""Champions"" as an uplifting gift.",1214006400,,968,4.372222222222222
2047472,4,B0001ZX0NI,"I absolutely love this movie; it's fantastically beautiful and inspiring...but I almost didn't get to see it.  When it arrived, still sealed in the layers of security tape and plastic, there were obviously broken pieces inside the case as it sounded like a baby's rattle.  I was nervous the DVD was broken or scratched, but thankfully once I finally managed to get it open, it revealed only the little button that holds the DVD had broken off in a few pieces.  This could have really scratched up the DVD, but it seemed okay and played fine.

I gotta say that disappointed me.  I mean, how the heck does that happen?? The DVD exterior case wasn't even cracked.  How'd the manage to break an interior part?",1200614400,,705,4.6
2047473,3,B0001ZX0NI,"Bob Champion was a point-to-point, or Huntsman Timber rider from Yorkshire,England. He was a success as a teen in this ""Steeplechase"" circuit and his racing career eventually brought him to America where he rode several winners. In 1979, Champion was diagnosed with cancer and was given six months to live. After enduring grueling chemotherapy in 1980, Champion was ""in the clear"" and returned to riding. His ultimate triumph was the 1981 Grand National Steeplechase aboard the horse Aldaniti. Such is the true and courageous story as told in the 1983 film CHAMPIONS starring English legend John Hurt as Bob Champion. Though I have seen this film several times since it's theatrical release,the screenplay is still a very hatcheted job of the book ""Champion's Story"".The screenplay jumps time zones and countries and characters as if it the the Grand National itself. It is an extremely choppy script. What this film does do well is show the wonderfully exciting yet dangerous world of horse racing ""over the jumps"", and can be viewed for a good,accurate and in-depth look at the dangers that jockeys and horses face. You will be moved by Champion's bout with cancer,but as a film, this movie has better action sequences than it does character development and plot.
Great companion films would be PHAR LAP,SECRETARIAT,NATIONAL VELVET,JOCKEY,BROADWAY BILL,RUFFIAN,BLACK GOLD and DAN PATCH.",1199404800,22,1388,5.256756756756757
2047474,5,B0001ZX0NI,"I first saw ""Champions"" as a theatrical release and then owned it on Beta (yep, one of those!).  I had a horrible time finding it on VHS, even on Amazon, and the only DVD versions were European.  But finally, it's out on DVD on this side of the pond and it's everything I remember.  Fine acting (John Hurt, Edward Woodward, a very young Kirstie Alley) and amazing horse riding and steeplechasing, ending with the most exciting race of all time, the English Grand National, 40 tall, wide, dangerous fences over a four mile course, at a full gallop, of course.  No horses may have been hurt in the creation of the film, but I'll bet you can't say that for the riders!

The story is a little trite: jockey develops cancer that may kill him and prevents him from riding, his favorite horse comes up lame and may never race again, they both recover at the same time, and well, you know the rest.  What's amazing, aside from the racing, is that this is a true story (the horse even plays himself, with full screen credit).

Highly recommended for anyone who likes English movies in general, horse racing in particular, and just a genuinely good, but often overlooked, film.",1198800000,3,1167,4.555023923444976
2047475,5,B0001ZX0NI,"What a great story of survival and triumph. John Hurt made me laugh and cry. It must be an oversight that he is not mentioned as 'The Star' anywhere on this page. Wait, there is his name in the picture of the DVD cover, look close, squint. It was fun seeing Kirstie all young and beautiful too. I love her.
  Bob Champion had an amazing career, winning over 500 races. After his illness he earned great quantities of money for cancer research. You can learn more about him at bobchampion.com
  And, of course, the 1981 Grand National and the horse, Aldaniti. What exciting video of the toughest steeple chase in the world. I'm not an expert, but I believe it is over four miles and has more than 22 huge fences. That any horse and jockey can survive this race when young and healthy is remarkable, to do it, both rider and horse, after fighting back from illness and lameness, is unbelievable. Except that they did, and won! Aldaniti plays himself.
  Thanks for finally bringing this great movie to us on DVD.",1194652800,14,1009,4.516483516483516
2047476,5,B0001ZX0NI,"In 1992 I was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 20.  While in the hospital I watched Champions and took strength from the story.  Whenever my body felt tired and my mind became despondent I would relive the story of Bob Champion and realize that through pain came hope.  I related to the story in many ways as I was/am a rider of horses.  When I was well enough to leave my hospital room, even if only for a short time, I would ride my own mare and pretend to be Bob Champion...  living his Grand National moments.  When my treatments ended and I was declared in remission I returned to college and acquired a position exercising steeplechasers for a training stable in TN. This movie was more than an inspiration for me and to this day I have no idea how it made it's way into my hospital room.  I highly recommend watching this story...  it will help you to find your own strength within.",1193184000,42,894,4.311377245508982
2047477,5,B0001ZX0NI,"We thoroughly enjoyed this ""based on a true story"" movie. My understanding is that the horse plays himself in it, which really adds an extra dimension.  Well enough done movie for any to enjoy, but great for any horse lover like myself.",1191628800,3,236,4.619047619047619
2047478,5,B0001ZX0NI,"Why isn't this movie available? I saw it in 1984. It made me laugh and cry. I purchased the video in the 90's, but the video could not be viewed. I would really like to see it again. I would really like to add a DVD copy of this movie to my collection. I cannot find it in DVD or VHS.

This movie is available all over Europe. You can buy the DVD from Amazon.com.uk. Of course that is in PAL format, which we cannot use. You'll be amazed if you do a search for 'Champions John Hurt'. It is everywhere.
