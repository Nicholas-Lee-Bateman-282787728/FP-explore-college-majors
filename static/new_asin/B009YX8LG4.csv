5373120,5,B009YX8LG4,"Probably Ted Kotchef's finest film, ""Wake In Fright"" (aka ""Outback""), shocked shamed, and enraged a substantial chunk of the Australian population.  It died at the box-office, got one TV screening in the early eighties (where I saw it), and then was forgotten -- or at least given up for dead.

Almost forty years later the negative was rediscovered only days away from final destruction (in the US of all places) and a badly needed restoration was begun.

The story: an endentured school teacher in a tiny outback town heads for Sydney and six weeks holiday.  But only a day into the journey he loses his money gambling, and is left at the mercy of the local townsfolk.

Like Roeg's Walkabout, Kotchef sees the Australian landscape with the fresh eye of a foreigner.  He portrays a society that no domestic film maker would've dared at that time.  And he makes a brilliant film doing it.  But where Roeg found a desert teeming with life and energetic beauty, Kotchef dicoves a desert surface a hard as iron -- and a population even harder.

""Wake In Fright"" (along with ""Walkabout"") started the renaisance of the Australian film industry.  It is beautifully photographed (or at least ""appropriately"" photographed), directed, edited, and acted.  For anyone looking for an insight into the Australian landscape, temperament, or character, this is the film.

So when is someone gonna get of their ass nd make this availiable in North America?",1266192000,4,1440,4.929460580912863

5373130,3,B009YX8LG4,"Wake in Fright is a film based on the 1961 novel by Kenneth Cook of the same title and was directed by Ted Kotcheff in 1971, starring Gary Bond, Donald Pleasence, and Chips Rafferty.  I have seen some references to this film and Mad Max but I would say it more likely inspired Deliverance (1972) based on the 1970 novel of the same title by James Dickey.  Anyway, here are the Pros and Cons as I see them:

Pros:
A realistic horror film about the brutality of mankind and the ignorance of mankind putting low regard to a teacher's worth that may make you uncomfortable but may also make you think (It actually reminds me of certain parts of the US unfortunately).

Cons:
WARNING: Hunting scene contains graphic footage of kangaroos actually being shot.  Producers' Note during credits:  ""The hunting scenes depicted in this film were taken during an actual kangaroo hunt by professional licensed hunters.  For this reason and because the survival of the Australian kangaroo is seriously threatened, these scenes were shown uncut after consultation with the leading animal welfare organisations in Australia and the United Kingdom.""  I would not consider the actual hunters professional since they were drunk and bad shots, but I also can't say it is completely animal abuse (in which case I would have given it a one rating) as kangaroo are actually hunted for their meat which I have had myself and which is actually good eating.  With that said though I found these hunters methods deplorable.",1482710400,3,1495,4.854330708661418

5373132,4,B009YX8LG4,"""Drink up.""

That's the constant refrain, at once friendly, taunting, and menacing, directed at John Grant, the antihero of Wake in Fright, a stunning, deeply disturbing psychological thriller set in the Australian Outback.

An arthouse Oz-ploitation flick of immense power, from 1971 and now rereleased in a restored edition, Ted Kotcheff's film is a confrontational deconstruction of the frontier masculinity that pervades so much of Australian and American cinema.

Grant is a schoolteacher stuck in the one-horse town of Tiboonda. He becomes embroiled in a nightmarish odyssey of alcohol, violence, and self-loathing when he tries to flee his backwater burg.

Wake in Fright opens with an aerial view of Tiboonda, a depressing, dusty village of a few buildings in the middle of a vast nowhere. It's Christmas break at the one-room school, and Grant is eager to join his girlfriend Robyn in Sydney.

His journey goes no farther than the small mining town of Bundanyabba (called ""the Yabba"" by locals) where he was supposed to spend a night before catching his flight.

Stopping at a bar, he's accosted by the local men - there are virtually no women or children in town - whose ferocious, aggressive hospitality and amity put Grant on the defensive. They buy him drink after drink and extol the Yabba's many virtues. By night's end, Grant is too drunk to walk and penniless, having dropped his cash in an absurd game that has folks bet their paychecks on the toss of a coin.

Grant meets a series of odd-and-odder characters, including Jock Crawford (Chips Rafferty) and a disgraced alcoholic former doctor named ""Doc"" Tydon, who is played by a brilliantly deranged Donald Pleasence. Each is plunged in despair, yet pretends happiness.

For fun, the guys drink and goad one another into feats of masculine prowess, and they suck Grant deeper into their collective psychosis.

Things go from bad to worse when Grant is taken on a kangaroo hunt. In a sequence that is difficult to watch, Kotcheff masterfully intercuts footage of actual hunters shooting and stabbing the animals.

Bloodlust is an apt term for what we see next, as the group's ecstasy of violence slides uncomfortably into the sexual.

Wake in Fright is essential viewing for anyone interested in the roots of male violence.",1474588800,,2291,5.034391534391534
5373133,5,B009YX8LG4,"This movie was Awesome- or should I say Aussome!!! Hey, I made a funny!!! !!! My hat Off!!!!! - To the people who saw the ""Deliverance"" parallel!!! With, of course, some contrasts and parallels!! I saw another parallel, oddly enough, with a film by another Aussie director: Nicholas Roeg. Apparently, this is one of the ""big three"" of Aussie New Wave films. The others being ""Mad Max"" and ""Walkabout"". But I see a parallel with another of Roeg's films: ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"".
Moreover, many are bothered by the slaughter of the kangaroos; and I was as well. I am an animal lover, although not a vegetarian. But apparently they were going to slaughter the roos anyway. So I do not condemn the filmmakers for using it for artistic purposes. Of course, the point in the film is that it is condemning this kind of behavior by macho A&%holes!! One could question why the government was performing the cull in the first place. By the way, another film that came to mind was - ""Cannibal Holocaust""!! This film is notorious for the killing of many animals. Also a 70's exploitation film!!

But besides animal lovers, another echelon of society should avoid this film, and those are - recovering alcoholics. There is so much alcohol consumption in this film, mostly beer,  and others have noted this,  that it starts to get to you after a while. I am an alcoholic, I have not had a drink in 4 1/2 years, and it did not bother me that much. But I can imagine a more hardcore drinker ( I just thought of something: that is what the film depicts: hardcore drinking)  than myself, who is trying quit, this would be brutal. This is another theme in the film - concerning too much drinking in the society. There is even a funny scene in the film - one guy questions how another guy would rather talk to a woman rather than drink.
Finally, again, This films Rocks!!!!!! Tense, atmospheric, sweaty, dusty, violent, realistic. And although billed as 70's exploitation (ozploitation) it is not a horror film. Tough to pin point genre!! How about: action/adventure - drama with a dash of thriller??",1468368000,,2084,4.624324324324324

Great actors appear in this film Jack Thompson and Chips Rafferty in particular stand out, it also has a British cast and was a co-production with Canada/England I think?!

5373154,4,B009YX8LG4,"The Australian film society dug this gem up and remastered it. It was worth the effort.

Here's the scoop. John Grant (Gary Bond) is a teacher in a bust-out town in the Australian Outback. He heads out for his six week summer vacation to Sydney. The town he stops in on his way to the airport proves to get the better of him and he spirals down into a pit of filth and degradation.

This is a rough ride. The group of guys he befriends, including an alcoholic ex-doctor (Donald Pleasence) don't seem to have much to do so they drink, drink, drink, hunt kangaroo and fight. This is an ugly existence. It's a barren, ugly landscape and the people mirror it. The kangaroo hunting scene made me uncomfortable. These were not special effects. They were really shooting these creatures. There was also a homo-erotic shade to parts of this. And given that it was made in 1971 that was some pretty heavy stuff. But the characters make this movie. This is a world apart. If you don't have money they will buy you a beer knowing you will reciprocate when things turn around. They might also take offense if you don't let them buy you a beer. These are some strange folk.

The acting is very good. It was a hoot seeing a young Jack Thompson. It took me a bit to recognize him. Also, this was pre-""Halloween"" Donald Pleasence. He was trim and much more physical back then. Ted Kotcheff helmed this outing. A couple of the scenes were a bit heavy handed but most of it was spot on. The soundtrack is also of note. One of the more interesting I've ever heard in a film.

As much as I might know film, this one never crossed my radar. I'm glad it's been reconditioned and released. It's a must see for any film buff.",1401494400,2,1701,4.356466876971608
5373155,1,B009YX8LG4,"Wow. This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It was recommended by many people/sites but I can't figure out why. Maybe I missed something but this movie was not at all what the description makes it sound like (the Mad Max and Walkabout references).

This movie was extremely slow-paced and boring but I forced myself to watch it because I was trying to see why so many people seemed to like it. [SPOILER ALERT, SORT OF] I got to a scene near the end where the people, for no reason really, decide to go shoot kangaroos. Unfortunately this is an old movie and this was before animal rights groups monitored things like this and so they used real animals to shoot, injure, and torture. At one point a dog attacks one and in another they hit one with a car.

I skipped that scene only to find out it was the end of the movie. That was all. No point. Nothing. Just senseless animal cruelty and a terrible movie to hold it together.

My recommendation would be to avoid this one.",1399507200,8,999,4.275132275132275

It's was a fun and yet dramatic thought-provoking film about one man's vacation letting go. Of course, if hunting bothers you, you might want to skip that part. All in all, a great little Aussie film. Nice print with plenty of extras about this film. Kudos to Image and Drafthouse Films.",1391990400,9,695,4.568
5373158,3,B009YX8LG4,"I'm having a little trouble giving this 3 stars but I think many of you, that will look at this, will be avant  gaurde viewers; You find acceptance for a movie set to -not just- a different drum beat but a beat that's a bit disturbing.  Over all it's not a fast paced movie, and the little action is sparse.  The filming is good.  I think that the acting is fine, and some might say that Donald Pleasence is superb.
  ***There are a few scenes- real filming- of animal cruelty.  This film probably sets a stage for a huge philosophical discussion with friends.  It will leave you with many questions about whether you 'got' the film's meaning, and only if you are sure about your take will you feel that you know.  But the others will be just as 'right'.  I feel that it's either dark existentialism or nihilistic.  For those of you that saw ""The Grifters"" and wanted to take a shower after, this will make you want to take a shower and get an inoculation.
  This is not a fun film, this is not a happy film, this is a film about a terrible vacation that is the result of poor judgment.  A man says: ""You know what?  I'm going to walk into a hell- which I do not need- and ruin my life, today.""
  My definition of FILM NOIR is different then you usually hear.  I say FILM NOIR is: ""Nothing will ever come of this.""  And all main characters will forever be lessoned from the experience.  This film is thus: 'film noir'.  Many seem to feel that this is a jewel but I feel that it's a contaminated scab.

5373173,4,B009YX8LG4,"Wake In Fright (1971) is an edgy and occasionally violent drama, set in Australia, that follows a school teacher's bizarre journey into a world, where fueled by alcohol, his inhibitions are lowered, and his darker nature emerges.  Recognized at the time of its release as a significant contributor to Australian cinema, this interesting and thought provoking film, originally titled ""Outback"", had somehow become lost for many years, until a print was fortunately discovered.  The restored movie, then became the source for this Bluray release.

John Grant (Gary Bond) is a teacher in the small town of Tiboonda, a dusty speck located somewhere deep in outback country.  On holiday for the summer, he takes a train to the city of Bundanyabba, planning to stay for the night, before heading to Sydney.  While drinking in a tavern, the teacher is befriended by Jock Crawford (Chips Rafferty) the local constable, and soon finds himself drawn to the town's major source of entertainment, gambling.  Initially a big winner, Grant's fortune reverses, and he finds himself flat broke, and dependent on the kindness of strangers.

With few options, Grant ends up at the home of a local, and after a night of heavy drinking, awakens in the cabin of Doc Tydon (Donald Pleasance).  Joined by two other locals, the four men drive off into the bush to hunt kangaroos.  In some memorable stomach turning scenes, kangaroos are brutally gunned down, and the wounded animals are then maimed or killed.  Graphic footage from an actual kangaroo hunt is featured, and watching the helpless animals being massacred, is not a pleasant experience.

Constantly drinking to excess, a frequently inebriated Grant, finds himself swept along by circumstances, into participating in some barbaric acts.  Disgusted by what he has become, Grant attempts to make his way to Sydney, but his journey seems to follow a circular path, which nearly proves fatal.

Based on a book by Kenneth Cook, and directed by Ted Kotcheff (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Blood/dp/B000H5TVKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Blood</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uncommon-Valor/dp/B00AEBB86U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uncommon Valor</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fun-With-Dick-and-Jane/dp/B000BITVA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fun With Dick and Jane</a>), Wake In Fright attempts to reflect in an accurate way, some of the bleak aspects of life in the outback, during this time period.  With little hope, most men turn to drinking, gambling, and other vices.  Although the film only briefly touches on the subject, with even fewer options, and greatly outnumbered by the male population, life for many women, is even more desperate.

Not a horror film, Wake In Fright plays it straight, showing how a few bad decisions lead to a very educated, civilized, and dignified man, losing sight of his core values, and heading down the road to depravity.  Were this tale told today, Grant might receive the ""Wolf Creek treatment"", and become a victim of a homicidal deviant.  Although subject to peer pressure, in this case, the destitute Grant's fall, is largely due to his own decisions.

The acting performances are generally quite strong, with many characters in the film often under the influence of alcohol.  Gary Bond is quite an engaging actor, who undergoes a dramatic transition, and seems to be channeling Peter O'Toole at times.  This is a physically active role for Donald Pleasance (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000UR9QHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Only-Live-Twice/dp/B00AZFECJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Only Live Twice</a>) one that even features him shirtless, and involved in love scenes.  Pleasance has a tendency to overact at times, but that's just part of his charm.

The image quality of the Bluray may not be that impressive, but it is probably the best the film will ever look, and it does a good job of conveying some sense, of the rugged, dusty, arid environment.  Among the extras is a commentary by Ted Kotcheff, and an enlightening Q&A with the director, at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival.",1370649600,3,4355,5.909090909090909

5373178,4,B009YX8LG4,"There's a great old Temptations song that goes ""you make your own heaven and hell right here on earth."" That would have made a perfect tag line for this rarely seen, one-of-a-kind 1971 drama. Restored in 2009 for a successful revival in Australia and considered a great lost film from that country's ""new wave"" of the early to mid-1970s, it was helmed by the eclectic Ted Kotcheff (""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz"", ""Fun With Dick and Jane"", ""North Dallas Forty""). As someone who is a huge fan of Aussie cinema from that era (""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", ""Walkabout"", ""The Last Wave"", etc.) I'm ashamed to admit that this film was under my radar until its belated domestic release on Blu-ray in 2013.

Here's the film's actual tag line: ""Have a drink, mate? Have a fight, mate? Have some dust and sweat, mate? There's nothing else out here."" That actually could work as a plot synopsis. Sort of a cross between ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and (speaking of the Australian new wave) Peter Weir's ""The Cars That Ate Paris"", it's a relatively simple tale about a burned-out teacher (Gary Bond) who works in a one-room schoolhouse somewhere in the Outback. Headed back to Sydney to visit his girlfriend over the school holiday, he takes the train to Bundanyabba (the nearest town with an airport) where he will need to lodge for one night. At least that's his plan. ""The Yabba"" is one of those burgs where the clannish regulars at the local pub take an unhealthy interest in strangers, starting with the (too) friendly town cop (Chips Rafferty) who subtly bullies the teacher into getting completely blotto. This kick starts a ""lost weekend"" that lasts for five days.

Without giving too much away, let's just say that the ensuing booze-soaked debaucheries have to be seen to be believed; particularly an unnerving and surreal sequence involving a drunken nocturnal kangaroo hunt that I can pretty much guarantee no film before or since matches for sheer audacity (a strange, lengthy disclaimer in the end credits may not assuage animal lovers' worst fears, but at least acknowledges viewers' potential sensitivities). That aside, this is a unique and compelling film; dripping with an atmosphere of dread and tempered by sharp, blackly comic dialog (Evan Jones adapted the script from Kenneth Cook's novel). Splendid performances abound, especially from Donald Pleasance as a boozy MD. Oh, and one more thing. In all sincerity, I hope that no one is foolish enough to devise a drinking game based around the film, because somebody in the room will surely drop dead of alcohol poisoning long before credits roll.",1360713600,4,2614,4.925170068027211
5373219,5,B009YX8LG4,"This film (set in the Australian Outback) is at once an hallucinatory nightmare and intensely realistic - so bizarre and yet utterly believable.  The acting is very fine - everyone disappears into their roles, and the cinematography and montage are excellent.  Donald Pleasance is especially good as the crazy old doctor.  The climax is unbelievably intense.  If you are a member of PETA you will not be able to watch the final Kangaroo hunt sequence.

Like The Hired Hand, The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid, Walkabout, and Don't Look Now, from that era, it came it under the radar, but it was surprisingly strong. The lead looks like James Franciscus, and he was very effective; but it was Donald Pleasance--I'm a big fan--and the woman who played his daughter (Sylvia Kay?) who impressed me. The film tracks a downward spiral in the glaring Australian sun & heat & night, relentlessly, the way Stephen Frears'  Dangerous Liaisons does-- oh no ! it can't be, but it is... I can't watch, but I can't turn away. No escape, no rescue. Pay the price; and it will be a steep one: everything. Well crafted given the relative unknowns in the cast and the subject matter. Glad it's out there. Flaws? I don't remember any. Maybe too specific to be universal, maybe the title; not a date movie, tough to recommend to your folks--they'll think it's about you.",1355184000,8,964,4.670588235294118

5373226,5,B009YX8LG4,"I came across a description of this film a while ago which made it sound like an overwrought B Picture, a format to accurately represent the world it depicts - melodramatic, crude and brash. It is much more than that. From the opening 360' panning shot around the tiny wooden platform of an Australian outback station, taking in two shabby and rusting buildings dwarfed by an endless vista of red sand, to the brilliant portraits of a range of characters who inhabit this barren and malevolent landscape, it constantly surprises and delights with visual power and human complexity. It is no surprise to discover that the underlying material on which the film is based, a novel by Kenneth Cook, was to have been a project for Dirk Bogarde and Joseph Losey at one point in its development. The film ended in the extremely capable hands of Ted Kotcheff and screenwriter Evan Jones and is beautifully constructed and paced. There is throughout a sense of threat and a sustained tension, but the tensions are those that exist within the central character and which this environment magnifies into threats - they are never simply imposed in a mechanistic fashion. Apparently the film was initially very well received, being lauded at the Cannes Film Festival and achieving some degree of commercial success in certain markets, but in Australia it was seen understandably as a fierce critique of the country and its dominant ethos at a sensitive time and so it disappeared seemingly for ever. The DVD is the result of a long search by the original editor who managed to unearth cans of footage in a warehouse in Philadelphia after many years of fruitless effort - and we should all be extremely grateful to him for preserving and restoring such an important and seminal work of the Australian New Wave.",1281398400,42,1795,4.850162866449511
5373227,5,B009YX8LG4,"Digitally remastered ""Wake In Fright"" (aka ""Outback"") is an intentionally forgotten Australian classic, The Cannes Festival shocker applauded and its lauvreat.

What happened to John Grant, a handsome young schoolteacher turned in two days into a dirty drunk, gambler and penniless sex object?
Outback happened - both a movie and its creators themselves state in DVD extras asserting this work, thirty years on, is still actual for and in Australia.

This depicting of civilization imported is really a rude awakening from an official icon Australia has been sold worldwide, and a modest reviewer might find it difficult to quarrel with such a statement as boxing kangaroo, for instance, is used to representing a country not in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mighty-Boosh/dp/B001EHF3RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mighty Boosh</a>&nbsp;only but as a national sports symbol officially.",1267747200,3,936,6.3046875

8545410,3,B009YX8LG4,"First off, I actually took the time to look up kangaroos and Australia and the latest statistics available showed that as of 2011 there were an estimated 34 million, which was significantly higher than 2010, which had an estimated 25 million. Many ignorant people will watch the movie and assume that kangaroos are being killed off in Australia by drunken hillbillies drenched in the filth of masculinity and alcoholism. According to the filmmakers they filmed an actual drunken frenzy of licensed kangaroo hunters on a legal blood crazed hunt. They said this was done to bring awareness to kangaroo extinction back in 1971. I myself am not a hunter and don't agree with alcohol fueled animal slaughter, which is why I took the time to actually find out fact and fiction. Besides the propaganda, the film was interesting by keeping you intrigued in what exactly is going on in this town. All good movies have a hint of the familiar combined with fiction, which this movie portrays by showing things people can imagine happening in far away place. Really, how different is it between what happens when this teacher comes into town and the average party-goer who has a wild time in Las Vegas.

Uninteresting.
I can use all three of those and many more, but after watching this, the question foremost in mind is, ""Why was this film made?"" Were they attempting to show the absolute most depressing side of life in Australia?
For all of the films I have seen, ""Wake In Fright"" joined an elite group of pointless films that not only avoided telling any particular story, much less have a point, but did absolutely NOTHING in developing any particular character.
The only rock-solid conclusion I can draw from this film is that Donald Pleasence either had the WORST agent in the business, or the most bipolar one. For as many great films as he was in, he also signed-on to appear in turd heaps like this.",1515801600,,728,4.6953125

There are no redeeming values to these people.  For all the time it took to make all this, there is nothing to be gained by watching this movie.  It doesn't tell a story.  This is one of the most retarded things I have seen in a very long history of watching retarded movies.  I see there are several FFF (fake, family, friends) reviews which is a true shame.

8545418,5,B009YX8LG4,"A sort of horror tale where the monster is one's own unquenchable impulse to self-destruct. Heat, the brutal sun of the outback, sizzles orange unto the sparsely populated dust flats of Australia. Protagonist John Grant, a teacher on vacation leave, travels through the outback to Sydney but is ultimately stranded on route in the small nowhere town of Bundanyabba where a sequence of trivial events leads him into a nightmarish frenzy of booze, hangovers, and madness. No binge or bender put to film has quite equaled the terror of the one depicted in Wake in Fright. Fans of boozy cinema will appreciate the increasingly maniacal hijinks Grant endures as he falls into alcoholic despair with an empathy for waking in strange places confused and aimless. Startlingly dark, the film smolders with intensity, pulling you deeper and deeper into Grant's unpredictable spiral. The acting is quite believable and Donald Pleasance is a treasure, perhaps giving his best performance. The hellish fear of getting lost in the depravity of vice has never been so honestly explored as it is in this film adaptation of the novel of the same name. A masterpiece of Australian cinema, Wake in Fright is a thrilling ride that haunts long after the credits.",1510185600,,1241,5.029126213592233
