8434833,5,B004LUFKIM,"Roy Harris is an excellent video instructor. As a 45+ year old purple belt with a lifetime of sports injuries that make getting out of bed most mornings a chore, I incorporated the fundamentals from this video set and went from trying to keep up rolling, to guiding the course of each and every roll. The injury protection alone was worth every penny. Rolling in class mainly from the knees, is very common, this video gives many takedowns that fit into the class atmosphere, especially for the 40+ crowd. Fine tuning the bent armlock is an indepth veiw of many overlooked basics, that turn them into high percentage submissions.
Takedowns from the knees:9
Bent Armlocks:9

8434834,5,B004LUFKIM,"Worth the price for the one over 40 DVD. Then you get two other awesomely detailed DVD's with it, seems like a bonus! Great work as always Roy Harris.",1399593600,2,150,4.206896551724138
8434835,3,B004LUFKIM,This is great for people just getting into BJJ. If your a more advanced BJJ practicioner you may not get a great amount out of it.,1373241600,2,130,4.038461538461538
8434836,5,B004LUFKIM,"I love this DVD set.  Anyone over 30 who has recently started BJJ will find a ton of knowledge in the BJJ over 40 dvd.  It is designed to help us older Jitsokas survive and win against that Twenty something ball of energy and strength across the mat.  The chapters focus on: Fundamental Movements, Defensive Postures, Defensive Positioning, Fundamental Techniques, Submission Escapes, and How to Train. The other 2 dvd's Takedown from the Knees, and Armlocks: Volume 2 will give you a bunch of techniques that you can slowly and successfully add to your game.
I found BJJ Over 40 worth the money by itself.  The fact that you get 2 more great instructionals as well makes this set a steal in my book.",1370649600,4,700,4.620967741935484
