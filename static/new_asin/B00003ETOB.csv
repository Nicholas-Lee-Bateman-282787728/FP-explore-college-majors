8562099,5,B00003ETOB,"Because 1) this DVD contains so many 'Quotes of John Muir', most of his famous quotes from his immortal writings and books about Yosemite, high Sierra, and Nature. These narrating quotes we could not find in any other DVD,  2) We could understand more deeply and dramatically Muir's philosophy of pure and spiritual love for Nature, contrasting to Roosevelt's utilitarianism. We could not find this essential story in any other DVD. This is the story of Vision (Muir) and Power (President), This is the drama of Poet (Muir) and Politician (President).",1211241600,2,551,5.054945054945055
8562100,2,B00003ETOB,"This DVD contains three features.  The first ""The Poet and the Rough  Rider"" is a dramatization of a meeting that took place between Sierra  Club founder John Muir and President Theodore Roosevelt.  The second,  ""John Muir's Yosemite"" contains miscellanious scenic shots of  Yosemite Valley with a voice-over of an actor reading passages of Muir's  writings.  The third feature, ""Falling Waters"" contains shots of  Yosemite scenery with a musical background.
When I purchased this DVD, I  was primarily interested in the ""Poet and the Rough Rider""  segment.  Unfortunately, this segment left me disappointed.  I suspect the  script bears little resemblance to what actually occured nearly 100 years  ago.  Actor Lee Stetson has performed one-man performances of John Muir in  Yosemite Valley for many years, and was convincing in this feature, but he  is shown arguing to close Yosemite to human visitation, a position I doubt  he would have taken.
The feature also suffered from a lack of budget.  Muir and Roosevelt were the only characters.  I would have liked to see the  look on the faces of Roosevelt's entourage when he insisted he would travel  into the wilderness alone with Muir.  I'd like to see the near panic at the  hotel when an unexpected storm drops a light snowfall overnight and the  President is out somewhere in it, then a cut to Roosevelt awakening to the  scene a beauty around him and shouting ""Bully!""
""John  Muir's Yosemite"" was my favorite of the three segments.  I judge these  videos according to how well the recreate the peaceful feeling I have when  I am actually in Yosemite.  Random shots from Yosemite Valley cut to Muir's  words pleasently brought me back to my own personal Yosemite memories.  Surprisingly, the voice-over is not Stetson.
""Falling Waters""  is best viewed on its own, not after the first two features, as it contains  scenery shots from the same stock as the first two.  The music is nice and  the scenery is second to none, but the editing is too fast.  Yosemite  gazing is best done at a slow pace.  During May visits I have gazed upon  the ever-changing upper Yosemite Fall for 10 minutes at a time.  Yosemite  videos should allow you to thoroughly soak up one image before moving to  another.
Yosemite lovers are better off with Sundance's ""Yosemite -  The Fate of Heaven"" (VHS only) or one Sterling Johnson's DVDs,  ""Acending Rhythm"" or ""The Seasons.""",968371200,21,2409,4.9075
