8222989,5,B000WE9IHU,"I have seen only partial segments of this amazing show and was truly touched by the stories that were shared.  I lived in Israel in 2006 for two months, returning to the USA just before the shelling and kidnapping of the Israeli soldiers began with the borders of Lebanon.  Israelis are a tough breed and do not give way to fanciful stories and pretend made up tales.  When soldiers and army commanders tell you this and thus happened, it is from a factual and real experience.  To have been able to stand at the Western Wall, the Kotel, and pray as a Jewish American woman and to hear the first hand accounts of the soldier, Kammali, sp? who led this brave re-capturing of Jerusalem, the Old City  and this Wall, back in 1967, when I was just a teenager was inspiring.  My family was expulsed from France in 1691 as Jews and although I do not know all my ancestral relatives and their stories, I knew there was something very special for me to personally being able to be at the Wall!  And to hear about President Richard M. Nixon's part in helping Golda Meier out at the time makes me want to go back and research more about his role in American & World History.

Please let us know when this DVD is available, this is definitely one of the best being touched by the Hand of G-d accounts, for the IDF, Israeli Defense Force and the country Israel.  You will be amazed at your new understanding of Hashem's caring for the nation of Israel, that took place within your lifetime! Real History, not a made up movie!
Humbly touched, Martela",1210032000,38,1537,4.421985815602837
