8318982,4,B001LNON3K,"The dubbing is awful, particularly while the woman sings Jingle Bells for what seems like a year, and the acting is sub par, but Klaus Kinski saves it, and because of this the movie somehow becomes really good. This Italian western, though, is really for fans of the genre. I think a non fan might have trouble getting through this one. I am a big fan of Kinski and while this is no Aguirre or The Great Silence, this flick has always been a favorite of mine. A remastered R1 blu-ray release would be very welcome.",1392249600,2,514,4.364583333333333
8318983,5,B001LNON3K,Shoot the living and pray for the dead is a masterpiece a classic one of the best spaghetti westerns ever made. Only downfall is finding out it's not the full 2.35:1 CinemaScope version but a 1.85:1 version of the film which wasn't all that bad nothing major is really missing most of the action is on screen I didn't notice any panning or scanning of the images the film has a great music soundtrack 2 goods songs by Ann Collins the opening song is awesome. Klaus kin ski is the best thing as usual in this violent spaghetti western masterpiece there's only 2 locations in the film a way station and the desert. The movie has a couple of pretty spaghetti western beauties some of the prettiest women in the 1960's and 1970's come from spaghetti westerns. All in all this a great movie a good way to spend 95 minutes of your time I highly recommend this film to everyone who loves movies not just spaghetti westerns.,1388275200,,916,4.458333333333333

***PLEASE NOTE MY REVIEW & RATING ARE FOR THE FILM ONLY-NOT THE DVD-R TRANSFER ADVERTISED HERE***

Klaus Kinsky and his outlaw gang rob the Phoenix bank and need to escape to Mexico to evade the law. A mysterious stranger (actor, Paolo Casella credited as Paul Sullivan), meets up with the gang at an out-of-the way saloon and kindly offers to be their guide for half of the gold. But is that his real motive? Giusseppe Vari directs this amazing Euro Western which has a plot that fits the description of a simple revenge story yet the movie manages to keep the viewer engaged with suspense, reasoning and character development. SHOOT THE LIVING, PRAY FOR THE DEAD has a lot going for it. Many of the supporting characters including the two females are more than just one-dimensional figures and have backgrounds and motives which help maintain interest and keep the story real. The shining star here is baddie, Klaus Kinsky who is completing engaging as the psychotic, unpredictable, misogynistic, foul-mouthed, bandit who can go from quiet and sympathetic one moment to loud and violent the next. The sets and cinematography are wonderful and there is a nice transition from the first half, which takes place inside a dark, claustrophobic rundown bar, to the remainder of film which was filmed in the hot, bright, sparse & rugged outdoor terrain. The bleak landscape helps emphasize the uneasiness of the characters as the group travels to Mexico. Mario Migliardi's diverse music soundtrack is perfect for film with piano & harmonica instrumentation and highlights action with interesting sounds at the right moments. I highly recommend seeing this film.

As noted above: I did not purchase this particular DVD-R. The copy I bought on Amazon is a Portuguese import by OCEAN but was listed as no longer available after I bought and received my copy. Hence, I'm sharing my assessment of this excellent film here and hope that it will encourage other Euro Western fans to check it out.  I rate this film 5 out of 5 bullets, but the 4 star rating listed is a compromise, since I haven't seen this transfer.  Thanks!",1383004800,,2157,4.882513661202186

8318986,4,B001LNON3K,"It's been a long time since this movie has seen the light of day, and Sinister Cinema has done an excellent job of delivering it on DVD.

It's made to order, so you'll be receiving a DVD-R burned with the film. Make sure your DVD player can handle computer-burned DVD's. My PS3 played it perfectly, however my buddy's older player had some issues with the disc and didn't play back properly. It's packaged very professionally and delivered promptly (1 week to LA).

For a film that's almost 40 years old, made by a production company that folded right afterward, it's a miracle enough that this title is even available. The quality of the burn is very good. Some artificating is visible in the blacks, and the original Cinemascope aspect ratio appears to have been lost. But the picture is only noticeably cut off in rare, select shots.

This film was notable in S-Western history for it's rare attention to story and plot. Most S-Westerns are low on story, high on violence. 'Pray for the Living..."" is the opposite. Great plot twists included into a solid western storyline. Klaus Kinski, if you're familiar with his unique approach to acting, is as crazy and unpredictable as he ever was. Well shot and well acted.

Order with confidence (as long as you check your DVD player) and enjoy a rare find. 4 out 5, coming up short only on the DVD-R aspect and loss of original aspect ratio.",1291680000,9,1387,4.648979591836735
