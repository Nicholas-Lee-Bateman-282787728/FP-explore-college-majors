8129700,1,B000GAKI6K,"I was so excited to find this set of DVD's on amazon - I'm raising my child bilingual and wanted her to be introduced to these stories in spanish.  However, I couldn't have been more disappointed.  The picture quality is the worst that I have seen in a DVD.  However what made it such an unacceptable DVD was the audio.

Pathetic.  Did any important figure in this studio even took a glance at the cover prior to distributing?  Good Lord...",1321833600,,306,4.735849056603773
