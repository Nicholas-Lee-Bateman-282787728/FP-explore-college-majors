8121612,4,B000FFJ8NU,"Gankutsuou is one of the finest adaptations of Alexandre Duma's The Count of Monte Cristo. It is also seasoned with some sci-fi element and gundam-like mobile-suit plot in it. Gankutsuou follows many parts of the setting the Duma's novel had but in some parts the animation series has some slightly different character settings such as:
In Gankutsuou Eugenie and Albert are truly love each other, but Duma's novel they are not.
In Gankutsuou series the count of Monte Cristo serves as something like the last to beat as you may find in role-playing games and Albert is ultimately the true protagonist. In Duma's novel Albert is merely one of the sub-characters nothing more or less. Such slight modification to the main plot is part of the reason why this animation series was applauded by younger generation who are grown up with gundam series and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Albert is never a hero type in western dramas but such character setting for protagonist is not rare in Japan as you can see in Evangelion series.

Because of the reasons I previously mentioned the ending comes in different way from Duma's novel. I do not want to give some spoilers. I hope you find out about it yourself.

Verdict: A bit different ending from I imagined but done nicely
Rating: 86 out of 100
Recommended for: Japanese animation fans who also love Gundam or Evangelion series.",1354406400,,1367,4.837606837606837
8121613,5,B000FFJ8NU,"It is a testament to this series that I am buying this DVD after I watched it  through Netflix (though I had purchased all the others up until that point).  Gankutsuou has been an inspirational series for me, getting me to read the original Count of Monte Cristo and reminding me that even though there is a lot of garbage to sift through when it comes to anime that is available in the US, it's worth it if you can find gems like this one.  The voice acting in both versions is amazing, and Taylor Henry's Count is superb.

The end of this series seems to leave things unresolved, which is actually refreshing.  Is the Count redeemed?  Is he saved by Albert?  Ultimately, as Maeda says in the extras, this story is about Albert.  The last episode simply focuses on him and how he's dealing with life.  At first I thought the final episode was a bit unnecessary, but it left me with a good feeling and looking back it makes sense that the episode was what it was.  Life goes on for Albert, and that's a good thing.

I really enjoyed this series, and as someone who's love of anime has decreased in recent years, I am so happy I found something as good as this.",1188777600,2,1160,4.299539170506913
8121614,4,B000FFJ8NU,"IMO this series could have ended with episode 23; it completes the story and would have let the story end on a high point. Instead, it ends on the next episode which really doesn't do anything for the story other than show you the characters after time has passed.

Despite my complaint, I urge you to watch this series. It is probably one of the best I have seen and is a pretty good interpretation of the classic novel. In fact, after watching this I went ahead and read the book all over again.

Highly recommended!",1169683200,,518,4.385416666666667
8121615,5,B000FFJ8NU,"As I watched through the final episodes, The exitement was almost too much to bear.  So much happens in just the first two episodes of this volume (21 and 22).  Although the exitement peiters off after this, you aren't left with that ""So what just happened?"" feeling that most anime's give.  You get a sense of relief that the characters have kept on living even after their lives were turned upside-down and seemingly torn apart.  There's not much more to be said about it except, well, watch it.",1161820800,,497,4.613636363636363
8121616,5,B000FFJ8NU,"I just finished watching all the chapters. I LOVED everything about this anime: The characters, settings, plot, and tiwists. It is one of the best I have seen in awhile. It stays realistic in that not all stories have a happy ending but yet can be entertaining. I became really attached to this story so much that I didn't want to reach the end. I promise that if you watch the first two or three episodes you WILL BE HOOKED till the end. In closing I just highly reconmind this anime if your into dark stories.",1158192000,2,511,4.333333333333333
8121617,4,B000FFJ8NU,"For those of you keeping up with the anime version of Le Comte, you won't be all that suprised with the revelations concerning the supernatural origins of Edmund's symbiotic relationship with Gankutsuou... though, the truth behind the Chateau d'If is a little odd. I was expecting a little more ""substance"" to Abbe when he showed up... this version was a little pale in comparison.

The last four episodes bring everything to a head... Danglars is off planet trying to escape scandal and financial ruin, Villefort is taken to court, and Morcerf impliments a military coup against the Parisean government after being disgraced by Haydee earlier in the series.

All the while, Albert can only plea with The Count to give up his revenge, a plea that falls on deaf ears... or does it? The series sums up with a spectacular duel underneath the Champs Elysees with a definite ending that I REALLY didn't see coming and a denouement episode that takes place five years after the ultimate climax.

The art direction/design is, of course, as spectacular as it has been throughout the entire series... both alien and familiar at the same time; vibrant, beautiful and disturbing.

The choice to go as far afield as they did from the original work doesn't detract from the series itself, as it does an admirable job at staying true to much of the spirit of Dumas' work, while going its own way concerning the character's ultimate fates... but, for nostalgic romantics such as myself, it hurts a little to see certain people die whilst others were renewed and forgiven.

Now... I call upon the production company to give us a sequel! ""Space Rogues: Benedetto and Edward Strike Back!""",1157932800,5,1670,4.866197183098592
