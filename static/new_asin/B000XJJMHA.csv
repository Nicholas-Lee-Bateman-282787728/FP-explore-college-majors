3488859,5,B000XJJMHA,This is a great anime and a must have. If your into great story lines and some comedy this is the perfect anime. It is one you can watch over and over.,1236038400,3,151,3.75
3488860,5,B000XJJMHA,"This anime series is first rate.  The animation is flawless and maintains a steady pace throughout.  The storyline is top notch as well.  The series concerns a man who has been found badly injuried and without any memory of his past or how he got to the village he is found near.  He is taken in by a family who gives him a name and is considered a brother.  There are several wars as he helps the people of the village and other villages obtain their freedom from a tyrannical emperor.

The music soundtrack is also first rate.  Even though the opening and ending songs are sung in Japanese, the beat makes you want to tap your feet.

I have many different anime series in my collection and I plan to add this one to my growing list.

I would not recommend this series for children under age 14 due to the extreme violence of the battle action.  But adults should enjoy the series due to the constant surprises in each and every part.",1228953600,16,935,4.32183908045977

3488877,4,B000XJJMHA,I very much enjoyed this series. I liked seeing hakouro rise to power and watching how he handled with the problems of the kingdom. I also like it that the main character rose to power rather soon in the series so most of the series is him as the emperor. I only have a few things that i think kinda keeps this series from being really good.(this might be a spoiler so i'm saying it now though i personally don't think it is) You never really find out about his mask. Why he's wearing it or why it won't come off Or what does the mask mean or how he got the mask? None of these are answered. That doesn't annoy me that much a few things are shown that gives you some possible answers but nothing is definite. There are a few more unanswered question to (i'm not the type to be bothered by that to much i tend to fill in the blanks myself if no answer is given ha). The ending was okay i was over all satisfied though i feel that it could have been better (though that could be just my wishful thinking of how i kinda wanted it to end),1456704000,2,1034,4.024271844660194
3488878,5,B000XJJMHA,Great show! My order came quickly. Packaging was great. No damage and my product was safe. I would buy from this company again. So this is a must by.

3488879,4,B000XJJMHA,Can say it's a good anime series of the Fantasy anime genre.  Recommended to any fan of this.  Also I think there was either a sequel or a prequel made for this.  Though not in this form as of yet.  Things are really hectic with anime licenses.,1452556800,,244,4.127659574468085

3488902,5,B000XJJMHA,Arrived on time and in good shape. Interesting show. I like how they replaced common things in our world with what could have been if our world had evolved somewhat differently.

I picked an anime that I never seen before to mix things up and it was really slow and kinda dull with the execution, like you would expect hard hitting twists and scenes that make you sit on the edge of your seat but I didn't get that with this anime. I'll keep it just because it's something my nephews can watch that n might entertain them but unless your familiar with this title don't purchase it as a mixer if you're not",1428710400,,488,4.202127659574468

3488910,5,B000XJJMHA,"okay, First thing to say about this anime is its not your usual quirky cat girl type, or trope, but the condition i got it in it played perfectly and every disk was in new condition, and naturally still wrapped, i do recommend a watch of this series because of the twists and personally i did get  immersed in the world and story. it is something of a dramatic story with a HUGE twist at the end that will leave you wishing they would have done something different but as far as my thoughts the series is well written, and if your a fan of the voice of edward elric you'll like his performance in one of the side characters in this one. (sorry the name of the voice actor is slipping from my mind.) but i have to say i am very satisfied with this buy.",1411516800,,751,4.108843537414966

3488922,3,B000XJJMHA,I'm terrible at writing synopsis' on shows so you can go elsewhere for that information. As for my opinion of the show I found it rather boring but suffered through til the end and wasn't too let down. I actually liked how it all concluded. Give it a shot if you like old-time/furry/identity-issue/daddy-issue type shows.,1401062400,,321,4.8545454545454545

3488925,5,B000XJJMHA,"Words cannot describe how awesome this anime is. The animation is beautiful and the battle scenes are interesting. If you like action anime (i.e. Rurouni Kenshin, another of my favorites) then this is a good anime for you. Also, I like how I got the complete series for a cheap price :D",1389225600,,286,4.519230769230769
3488926,4,B000XJJMHA,"Utawarerumono is an anime whose focus is really centered on the interpersonal relationships of the main protagonist, yet it is far from a romance story. The anime has a very strong first four episodes, which I can easily give 5 stars. We are dropped into a new world, not knowing anything about the setting, and the amnesiac main character really works to the viewer's advantage here. As the main character uncovers more information about the setting, the more we too learn about the world and its inhabitants. The first few episodes also feel very self-contained and satisfying in and of themselves.
However, passed episode 4, the five star setup starts to get peeled away by villains who do not receive as much fleshing out as the main protagonists and inconsistencies in logic. It becomes immediate by the middle of the series that the creator had high expectations for his work, but didn't think things through as well as he should have. Still, the flaws do not take away a great deal from the enjoyment, since the real focus of the story is on the characters. Its just too bad that the political and war-like elements aren't as well thought out as the characters themselves. The ending works well enough, although it tends to create a bunch of new questions in its attempt to answer the mysteries built up throughout the series.
Regardless of its shortcomings through, Utawarerumono's strengths outweigh its flaws. A proper rating for Utawarerumono would be either 3.5 or 4 stars. It's a good character focused anime with a mystery on its shoulder that unfortunately drops the ball one too many times to get the full 5/5 rating.",1386115200,2,1633,4.835714285714285

 All 4 discs come in a single standard size DVD case,
 On the inside flap(left side) is a convenient episode list by disc, on the right side is the main cover but without the green S.A.V.E. edition on the binding, so this allows you to easily reverse the cover and have a clean cover and spine and a simple episode list on the back.",1377907200,6,509,4.08

  What a joke...I do have this series and would buy it on blu-ray, as would I buy... Kanon..Ergo Proxy..Darker than Black...Bacanno is just a bit to high at 62 bucks.
 As for myself, I enjoyed the series but will not pay this amount. If you can afford it...go for it I guess. Let me see.....

The story is a nice refreshing story, with a twist. This show is full of action, drama, excitement, and heart felt moments worthy of being shared. The series follows a more serious tone and is not chalk full of fan service, silly humor or thin plot lines. My kids enjoyed, I enjoyed it and that is what truly matters.

3488944,3,B000XJJMHA,This anime reminds me of Samurai warriors the video game. Conquering other lands and having different generals. Animations was good but story line starts out slow and not enough action for me.

I was actually pretty satisfied with the ending, normally i never am. the only thing that bothered me was the fact that the song that plays on the last episode wasn't heard. Basically it was just the sound/music, no words, if you watch the episode in Japanese, then the full song (music AND lyrics) does play so i had to change the audio to Japanese. It made that scene so much more powerful with the lyrics included. all in all, a great anime, has its great comedic moments and truly worth the watch and buy! :D",1371254400,,688,4.180451127819549

3488971,5,B000XJJMHA,"A masked man is found by a girl named Eruru. Along with her Grandmother and little sister, Eruru nurses him back to health. When he awakens, he has no memory. Grandmother gives him the name Hakuoro. He is, however, well educated in many ways. He decides to stay with the villagers and help them in their tough time. An oppressive emperor rules over the land and brings hardship to his people. In a sad twist of fate, Eruru's Grandmother is killed. The villagers rally behind the masked man, now known as Hakuoro, and begin to launch a rebellion against the emperor, whom they soon defeat. After Hakuoro becomes emperor, his past comes back to haunt him. His friends are loyal and stick with him no matter what he has done. Eruru becomes his anchor, and gives him the strength to fight for what's right. As their success grows, more nations join them and fight with Hakuoro and the others. The action and drama are fantastic.

This anime got weirder as it progressed. It's kind of like a cross between Inuyasha and Record of Lodoss War. I really enjoyed it. It has a great story, great voice actors, a great soundtrack and great animation. As I said, toward the end it gets kinda strange. All of a sudden, mecha, high tech research labs and cloning are taking place in a feudal age world. It doesn't get too far out though. It's easy to follow at least. The drama and action are amazing. The only complaint I can really have is that Hakuoro and Eruru didn't realize each others feelings till the end. There was plenty of time to develop that, but they didn't. It did have a good ending though. Overall, this anime is excellent. I recommend Utawarerumono to any anime fan over the age of 10.",1354579200,4,1689,4.519607843137255

The animation is great, the music complements the story and the characters are excellent.
A lot of great action and sword fighting.
If you enjoy this series.... check out ""Moribito"" as well. Another great series to own.

3488977,4,B000XJJMHA,"So after reading some of the other reviews, I decided to watch the anime as I had just received it from Amazon to see how different it was from the game (Which I have played and completed), the game is a visual novel/strategy game so theres alot of story in it, which is perfect to make an anime adaptation, I had seen some episodes before but never really watched the whole series until now, heres my review.

The setting is what appears to be Feudal Japan, the genre is a mix of fantasy with sci-fi and plenty of drama as there is constant war among countries so theres plenty of death to go around.

The story is about a man named Hakuoro who one day wakes un in the house of a family of healers, the man is suffering from amnesia and apparently is the only human in the village as all the other residents have tails or animal hears, but he is no normal human himself as he is wearing a mask that he cannot take off,  life seems to carry on peacefully however that soon changes as their emperor seems to be out of touch with people, Hakuoro (named by the village chief) has to step in and lead is village into battle against their emperor and later on against other countries emperors. still the questions remain, what is this mask he can't take off? what is his past? and what is this world he is living in?

The first 2/3 of the series is quite easy to follow, the story concentrates on the war effort of his village/country and securing his people from attacks of other countries, however on the last 1/3 of the series the Sci-Fi kicks in, and this is where the anime suffers /get confusing, what was well explained in the visual novel was not so well explained in the anime, a few key elements to help understand viewers who some characters were, are omitted (Mitsumi) and the light from the sky, and thus leaves the viewer questioning who the heck is she and what is that light.

Now lets talk about the quality of the anime, as story goes I would give it a 8/10 I'd give it a 10 if it were explained like in the game which I loved, as music goes its pretty generic though It does have a few good tracks, I especially love  the song played in the last episode, being a war anime there are plenty of fights, about half way into the anime the characters start getting some great fight animations, unfortunately during the span of 3-5 episodes these animations are repeated quite bit thus if have less impact each time you see then.

I'm pretty happy with this set, my only real gripe is that its missing the bonus episodes, I think they were 3, these are comedy episodes and don't affect the story, these were made from the comedy parts in the game itself and are pretty good actually, but alas they were not included here on this S.A.V.E set, I may sell it to get the other set which I assume has them (please do tell me if they do have them).

If you want to look for an action anime (not in the veins of Naruto or Dragon Ball) then I recommend this series, you may get a bit confused near the end, but if you patch it up with wikipedia you will find the story to be quite good.

Story 8/10 (anime) 10/10 (visual novel)
Music (6/10) (few memorable tracks though its all subjective to each person)
Animation (6/10) I don't usually care about this but since they did recycle a few animations in a few episodes I noticed it and while good, its also annoyinh.

For the price, definetely get it, even with its flaws its a very enjoyable anime, heck I definetely want to get the other box set just to have the extra bonus episodes.

If anyone want to know what was missing from the anime compared to the visual novel contact me, I'll gladly spoil you :)",1309478400,,3655,4.282608695652174
3488978,3,B000XJJMHA,"this isn't a bad anime, mostly your run of the mill fantasy anime. not bad for the price, and if your bored and have nothing new to watch, why not? :P",1306886400,2,150,3.870967741935484
3488979,2,B000XJJMHA,"Do you like epic war scenes?  Do you like harem shows with no comedy?  Do you like funky ears?  Do you like it when all the non-important characters look almost exactly the same and die off in droves?  Do you like your villains to have sexy silver hair?  Do you like strange and unexpected plot twists that don't make a lot of sense?  Then this is the show for you!

When I bought this I had no idea what it was about other than what it said on the box, but hey, cheap anime.  And it starts off pretty decent.  There's this guy, and he doesn't know who he is, where he came from, what he's doing, or how he came to be passed out in the middle of a forest with severe injuries.  The show starts there, with his recuperation with the aid of a couple cat (or dog?) girls and their wise old grandma.  Through his gentle but authoritative persona he gains the trust of the village and eventually (about 3 episodes in) the leadership position of a rebellion against the repressive emperor of their country.  So far so good.  Then he wins!  Hurray, good show!  Wait, no, that's not even close to the end.  The real meat of the show lies in following the mysterious Hakuoro as emperor of a country, fighting to keep it free while struggling to remember his own strange and mysterious past.  And also the show is about the activities of his collection of fine ladies.  Okay, there are three or four other guy characters who get a chunk of time, but that's mostly in the show's first ten episodes.  They get pushed to the side pretty early in favor of the ladies.

The show basically has three plot arcs, and while the first two are entertaining, with epic wars and stuff, the last one is pretty disappointing with its slow moving start, surprise mecha, and frustratingly dumb conclusion.  The mystery of his mask is solved, but it is a disappointment, mostly because of what it does to the setting of the story.  It raises more questions than it answers, but these are the kind of questions that make you start picking apart the mechanics of the world and setting and shake your willingess to invest in the plot.  Just for example: how does magic work if this is in fact a science fiction setting rather than the epic fantasy it had been for the first 24 episodes?  A bad ending can ruin a show, and this one has a lot riding on the resolution of what's behind that mystery mask.  And in this case, what's back there is, well, if you watch a lot of  anime or play JRPGs, you can probably guess from the first teaser flashback in the very first episode to a degree what his secret turns out to be.  Except more silly somehow.

At any rate, animation wise this is pretty solid for the most part.  The characters generally stay on model, but there is quite a bit of conspicuous CG in the wide battle scenes, and that can get distracting if you dislike that sort of thing.  The character designs are pretty cute overall, though you can always tell the bad guys by their pretty silver hair.  Seriously.  As far as voice performances go, the dub is decent and the music is all right.  The ending song in particular is actually pretty pleasant.  The dvds are incredibly basic: the main menu is just a list of episodes and a language menu.  The clean opener and ender are part of that list on the third disk, though they don't play automatically like the episodes do.  Trailers are on the fourth disk.  Very, very basic stuff, but this is the cheap set, so you get what you pay for.  The cover, by the way, is reversible so you don't have to have the S.A.V.E. binder sticking out if you don't want to.

Once I saw it was in this cheap set now as oppose to how it was originally released, I had to pick it up to watch again.  This time around I watched the dub of it since I always saw the Japanese version and it was very good.  A very good show and a very good price to go with it.",1294531200,2,358,3.6842105263157894
3489001,3,B000XJJMHA,"While strolling innocently through the forest one day, Eruruu finds an injured man with a mysterious mask. She takes him to her grandmother Tuskuru, the village healer, and the two of them nurse him back to health. When he wakes up they are surprised to find that he is unable to answer any of their questions - he just can't remember anything! He doesn't understand why he is wearing a mask or why he is unable to remove it. But despite his oddities, the man, now dubbed Hakuoro, is a natural leader and soon the villagers look to him to guidance.

When I heard the premise of this show I thought it sounded intriguing. And it was curious - who was Hakuoro and what was that mask for? The characters were not very deep, but they were entertaining. The world the series is set in is interesting. Why do all of the girls have animal ears and tails? Hakuoro proves to be an unexpectedly interesting character and his rise in power was particularly fun. But there were times in which the series moved slowly and they spent too much time on the cute little girls with tails. But it was still fun to watch. Except that you start to get frustrated with the main plot line. You start to wonder if you will ever lean the secret behind that darn mask and such. For about 24 episodes you are left in the dark, with only small flashes of memory from Hakuoro to give you hope for an answer. Then bam! the end hits and things are thrown all topsy-turvy. What you thought was a fantasy story turns out to have mecha. Historical setting? Ha! But worst of all, when the series ends, you have more questions then when it started! If it hadn't been for the stupid ending, this series would have been a solid 4 star anime.

If a confusing and pointless ending doesn't bother you, then by all means, go ahead and get this series. It isn't very expensive and for the most part it is entertaining. The Omake are hilarious and you should make sure to watch them (NOTE: I originally watched this series on the individual DVDs, then bought the SAVE edition. So I only recently noticed that the SAVE edition doesn't actually have the Omake... Too bad!). The English dub isn't bad, but I would recommend the Japanese dub 'cause it is better.",1291334400,18,2214,4.424019607843137
3489002,5,B000XJJMHA,"If you are one to enjoy a cool cast of characters running around doing awesome stuff, then this is an anime series for you. From the very beginning moments when Suara's song during the intro credits kick in, you know this is going to be a fun series. five stars may be a little generous, but i think it fits.

The story follows a protagonist who has lost his memories as he makes friends, dares great things and tries to lead a people to peace and prosperity. While doing so, by force of his character, he draws in a number of side-kicks who are intriguing and engaging.

My only two gripes with this series were: (1) things get a little nutty at the end and what was a simple fantasy story eventually brings in all kinds of weird from large monster battles to weird futuristic past flashbacks and religious complexities that take a lot of thinking to keep up with, and (2) while i understand the aesthetic of suffering and stoicism that are so tied up with Japanese mythic narratives, i still am a big fan of quasi happy endings. this one is mostly happy...but still.

In all, i found myself racing through this series, not being able to control my desire to see what would happen next. I loved it.",1290124800,11,1199,4.416289592760181

3489007,5,B000XJJMHA,"This is one of my favorite anime. The story description on the box really doesn't do it justice. I wasn't interested in seeing it at all until I put it on netflix for back ground noise while I did laundry. It starts off slow but picks up with some strategy, fighting, and humor. There is never a battle in every episode, there are breaks which help to get to better know the characters and add a more realism to the story. I will agree that the story line is good up to the point that the giant robots come in. Then the story goes from feudal fantasy to weird high tech. To be quite honest I usually only watch up to that point, but I have seen the end three times. I have a bit of understanding and a bit of 'what the hell?!?!' type of confusion. Reading online story comparison to the game actually helped me better understand what was going on... I still prefer the first 3/4 of the series. I really love the mini stories! The first one with Oboro and Hakuro is my favorite... but they are all too funny. I wish the anime (first part) was longer it was really good.

The animation is top notch and the character designs are charming.  The story line is full of ups and downs.  And for once, I agree with the choice of American voice actors, they fit their roles perfectly.",1252800000,,380,4.529411764705882
3489009,4,B000XJJMHA,"First of all, let me say that no aspect of this series is outstanding. Rather than being brilliant at one thing, it's more of a good all-round series. It's a solid series; one that fans of war stories set in the ancient past will get into from the get-go. And, despite the main character having his own harem, it's safe to say the series can be enjoyed even by those who dislike harem series.

The story starts with a man getting found injured in the forest near a small farming village. He has a mask, no memories and doesn't have a clue who he is or what he was doing in the forest. He quickly becomes friends with Eluluu, the young healer who found him, and her little sister, Aruruu. He gets given the name Hakuro by the village chief - the name of Eluluu and Aruruu's father.

At first all is well but the situation quickly turns ugly. Hakuro has to come up with a tactic to save the villagers from being eaten alive by the angry 'God' of the forest. He does so, and earns the respect of the entire village. Then the local feudal lord pays a visit to the town in order to collect taxes. One of the guards kills the village chief, resulting in Hakuro being named chief, and he helps the angered villagers lead a rebellion against the feudal lord. Hakuro kills him, which leads to the Emperor getting involved in an attempt to avenge his brother.

From there, the series takes a path fans of the Suikoden video game series will be familiar with: armies fight, new, super strong allies join and, bit by bit, Hakuro's army grows in power. Soon a mere rebellion transforms into a war between nations, with war after war following Hakuro as he rises to power, as if caused by him. As he continues to become more powerful, staining his hands with more and more blood, the questions of who he is and if what he's doing is right become increasingly troubling.

Where the story falls short, after an involving opening and enjoyable middle, is the ending. Prior to the last section of the story, it had been fast-paced bows and arrows warfare. Aside from a few winged magic users, there'd been nothing to suggest the ending would be quite so ridiculous. All of a sudden robots come into the picture, with one nation destroying all others with these machines, and Hakuro's true identity is revealed during the mecha action. In an attempt not to spoil the story, I'll just say that Gods, evolution, space stations, hi-tech science labs, blob monsters, reincarnation, a Godzilla style final battle and all of the usual anime ending stuff you can think of comes into play. I'm not quite sure how to describe it, actually... It's best just to say it ends in a horrible manner and leave it at that. It's a shame because if the series had ended like it started, without all of the seemingly random rubbish, it could've been a top anime.

The ending aside, my other story issue lies with the battle tactics. Hakuro's tactics usually come down to him telling people to go left or right and him letting his elite soldiers slaughter the enemy soldiers. With the main character playing the role of tactician and the story being about him quickly rising to power, I expected in-depth, jaw dropping battle strategies. Maybe I was expecting too much? I don't know, but it's fair to say the battles could've been more complex.

While on the subject of battles, if you've played any of the Dynasty Warrior games you'll have a good idea how the combat goes in Utaware. The generals are all powerful, killing the grunts with one blow, and the proper, more intense combat involves one on one battles between opposing generals. But the combat isn't very exciting, with some animation recycling occurring and the important fights just simply failing to get my blood pumping. It's a shame because some dodgy, out of place CG aside, Utaware is lovely to look at. The art is appealing, the colours vibrant and, as far as I'm aware, the backgrounds were all drawn by hand, giving them extra charm.

To end my story comments on a positive note, I'll end by saying that, if nothing else, the Utaware story is an entertaining one to sit through. The story is always on the move, with there rarely being episodes not focused on the on-going struggles of Hakuro, and it flows excellently from episode to episode. Another story positive is lack of perverted content. I may be little off when I say this but I think the game the anime was based on was an erotic one, involving Hakuro picking one of the female characters to be his girl. While there are elements of this in the plot, in the anime it comes across more like a straight-forward romance that develops in a logical way as the series progresses. The only scene that comes close to crossing the line is one where Karula - a warrior with a HUGE sword and big boobs - offers herself to Hakuro in exchange for his help and almost gets accepted. Overall, the series was highly enjoyable and surprisingly tasteful.

In terms of the huge cast of characters, Utaware is a little hit and miss. The cast are more likeable than well developed. The main cast members all stand-out, with most of their names and personalities sticking in my mind straight away, but not many get fleshed out. You learn their quirks and that's it for the most part. Hakuro gets the most time, as you'd expect with him being the main character, but you never see a lot of his past, and what's shown isn't very clear. Eluluu, the female lead, is cute and likeable enough and her interaction with Hakuro and her little sister, Aruruu, adds depth to her character but she very rarely came across like a real person. Aside from those two, only Oboro and Karula get decent development. Oboro fights whilst constantly worrying about his blind and bedridden little sister (some early episodes focus on this subplot) and Karula has her own little story relating to her past. In short, the cast have a lot of likability but fairly limited development, with a lot of the blame for this laying with the series length.

As for the music, Utaware has a solid soundtrack. There are some memorable tracks and lots of fitting music that, while unlikely to be listened to outside of the anime, improves the viewing experience. The opening and ending themes are very good, the opening in particular sticking in my mind.

All in all, Utaware surpassed my expectations but still ended up disappointing me because of how it ended. Until the final volume I was prepared to score it in the 9-10/10 tier, but it'll have to make do with a solid 8/10 instead. I respect the series for not being perverted despite it being based on an erotic game and having a large cast of attractive females. At worst, you could say it panders to the moe market a little, but there's nothing included that made me think the series was aimed more at perverts than people looking for a good story. I recommend anyone looking for some primitive, bows and arrows war look the series up.

Rating: 8/10

-----------

There's one last, non-vital thing I'd like to touch upon: the DVD extras.

Included on the Utaware DVDs is a four part omake series. These short episodes focus on light-hearted fun - very different from the usually serious main story, and I rated the omake series 9/10; one point higher than the main series. Why the rating, you ask? Because the omakes are hilarious. I'm not the sort of guy who roles around laughing, but even I laughed during the third episode when, after Oboro had broke her doll, Touka went insane, beating the crap out of Oboro and making some of the most weird and amusing screams I've ever heard. I loved how Hakuro left the room after seeing Touka's bloody hand and crazy expression, leaving Oboro to his fate (once again!).

Do yourself a favour and watch the Utaware extras. You won't regret it.",1248307200,36,7779,4.582314881380302
3489010,5,B000XJJMHA,"This story is enthralling! The characters grow and relationships blossom, pulling in viewers who love stories about believable characters(the writers make the character's quite lovable!).
  It is easy to see how this story could have formed from a game, with the main character's having to survive one assault after another; the plot never stops moving. When the tale starts to swing too violent or to sappy for too long, it starts to move back the other way. So in spots that get too predictably sappy; then you know the plot's about to twist.
  A viewer can enjoy this continual struggle for survival while watching the army battles and the personal duals! The story stays true to war and some of your favorite characters die, but the action rarely stops to even grieve.
  But the story goes way beyond a simple battle with it's surprisingly beautiful and rich depth contained in the main characters. If you like action, or soft touching drama, this anime is it! Oh, and it's got fox tails, feathered wings and such are here too...",1236124800,12,1033,4.775280898876405
