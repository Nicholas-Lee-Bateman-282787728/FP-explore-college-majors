1231321,4,B00000J11L,"WWF IYH:  Backlash followed WM 15.  The main event was the rematch for the WWF Title between Champion-Stone Cold Steve Austin(yawn!!!) and Challenger-The Rock.  Shane McMahon is the special referee.  Some funny  spots surface when the Rock decides to use the people's camera.  For the  first time you will see the Undertaker take on Ken Shamrock in an actual  WRESTLING match.  The same can be said for the HHH vs. X-Pac match...a  WRESTLING match.  Fans seem to have forgotten what real WWF action is.  In  an action packed match you will see Mankind vs. the Big Show in a Boiler  Room Brawl.  Plus, Owen Hart's last PPV as he teams with Jeff Jarrett to  take on the New Age Outlaws.  The Godfather defends the WWF  Intercontinental Title against former champion Goldust.  The WWF Hardcore  Title is on the line when Hardcore Holly defends his title against Al Snow.  Also included is a six-man tag team match between the Brood (Gangrel,  Edge, and Christian) and The Acolytes & Midian of the Ministry of  Darkness.",937526400,,1016,4.745664739884393

1231325,4,B00000J11L,"The Brood vs. The Acolytes & Mideon

Good opener.  It's fun to look back now at the partcipants and see how they've progressed professionally.

Hardcore Championship

Hardcore Holly vs. Al Snow

These guys had some battles back then and this is no exception.  They go everywhere and use everything.  Very good match.

Intercontinental Championship

The Godfather vs. Goldust

Well you certainly can tell this is the attitude era.  Decent for entertainment value but otherwise a very subpar title match.

New Age Outlaws vs. Owen Hart & Jeff Jarrett

Owen's last ppv appearance.  Not too bad but the usual mid-card tag team affair.

Boiler Room Brawl

Mankind vs. Big Show

Best match of the night.  There's no one like Foley.  Lots of action and the obligatory brutality.  Great match.

X-Pac vs. Triple H

My how Trips has come a long way.  His first singles ppv match as a heel.  Great match and even better ring psychology.  The finish is excellent too.

Undertaker vs. Ken Shamrock

I'm not sure what the crowd and others here were watching but I saw an amazing technical match.  The reversals and holds applied in this were great.  It was too long but still a good match.

WWF Championship

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Rock

They did it again!  This is mostly a brawl and there isn't much happening in the ring but this was a great match.  Unheralded in the Rock/Austin canon.",1106697600,5,1385,4.70464135021097

Providence Civic Center

Providence, Rhode Island

The Brood V. Acolytes & Mideon

Ok opener. Could have been better. Acolytes & Mideon win. **

WWF Hardcore Championship:

Hardcore Holly (Champion) V. Al Snow

Great match with the two going everywhere in the Civic Center. Snow finally wins the Hardcore Championship with a head shot with, well, Head. ****

WWF Intercontinental Championship:

Godfather (Champion) V. Goldust

This match wasn't your classic catchus-catch-can wrestling match, but it was pretty damn funny with the Godfather retaining. **1/2

New Age Outlaws V. Jeff Jarrett & Owen Hart

The winners of this match get a WWF Tag Team Title shot. Pretty good match with the Outlaws winning. **3/4. Sadly, this was Owen Hart's last Pay-Per-View match. R.I.P. We all miss you.

Boiler Room Brawl:

Mankind V. The Big Show

Great match with some sick bumps in there. I don't think you can fake being Chokeslamed through glass! Mankind wins. ****

Triple H V. X-Pac

Another great match. This was a classic NWA style match with a WWF ending. Triple H wins. ***3/4

The Undertaker V. Ken Shamrock

I don't care who says it, I think this was almost the showstealer. This was a technical masterpiece in my opinion. Great wrestling. Taker wins in a very underrated forgetten classic. ****1/4

WWF Championship:

Stone Cold Steve Austin (Champion) V. The Rock

Great match, maybe even better than their WrestleMania XV match. Austin retains. ****1/2

Overall, a great show. The Main Event didn't disappoint, the Triple H/X-Pac match was great, the two hardcore matches were awesome, and the underrated Taker/Shamrock match was a war. A Great Pay-Per-View. It was better than WCW's April Pay-Per-View, Spring Stampede, but that's not saying much.",1095033600,,1782,5.128919860627177
1231327,2,B00000J11L,"Triple H vs. X-Pac
Triple H needed Chyna to help him beat X-Punk. The only reason Kane interfered was to even the odds,but it was too late. If Triple H is ""that damn good"" then why does he need everybody to intefere for him. I am glad he tore his quad, because then I didn't have to see his monkey face for 9 months. Now RAW has become ""The Triple H show""

WWF Title.
Stone Cold Steve Austin(c) vs. The Rock with Shane McMahon as the guest referee. Another great Austin/Rock match messed up by Vince and Shane interfering. Anyway Austin retains the title after the Stone Cold Stunner.
Ken Shamrock vs. The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer. Another lousey match with The Undertaker winning(thank goodness).
Two stars and that is me being generous.
Boiler Room Brawl
Big Slow vs. Mankind
the only encounter that saved this event. once again interfernce from Bossman and Test. Mankind wins it.
#1 contender's for the Tag Team Titles
New Age Outlaws vs. Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart w/ Debra. An ok match The Outlaws win by pinfall.

1231328,4,B00000J11L,"I can't believe Brahma Bull had the nerve to say this PPV was a waste of money and time and saying that the Boiler Room Brawl was the only good match on the card.  What was he smoking when he watched this?!?!  Yes, the boiler room brawl was the best match on the card, but it was not the only good match on the show. Hell, 6 out of the 8 matches on the card were very good.
The one thing I liked about Backlash was the variety of matches.
It covered just about every aspect of wrestling.  It was entertaining, had tons of hardcore wrestling, techinical wrestling, and fast-paced action. Here's a breif run-down of the card and my opinions of the matches.
1. Brood vs Acoloyes and Midian
 Not an excellent match, but a good way to start off the show.  Visceria interference was a little lame but it still a decent match 6/10.
2.  Al snow vs Hardcore Holly
 This was the third PPV in a roll where these two battled for the hardcore title.  They use hockey sticks, frying pans, table, and snow tosses holly into the roof of a car which left a huge dent in the car.  Good match.  8/10
3.  Godfather vs Goldust
 This was for the IC title and was basically just for laughs.  Neither one really showed off their abilities but it was entertaining when goldust tried to throw salt in the godfather's eyes only to have it backfire and go in his eyes.  He accidentally attacked the blue meanie and give meanie the shattered dreams while the crowd was laughing hysterically.
I give it 5/10 only for the entertainment purposes.
4.  New Age Outlaws vs Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett
  This match was for the #1 contender for the tag team titles held by kane and x-pac.  It was entertaining and very fast-paced.
The fans really didn't get into the match because they were all focused on debra and wanting her to show her puppies.  Anyway, very fast-paced and enjoyable considering that tag team matches are usually not all that good.  I give it a 8/10
5.  Mankind vs Big Show
  The boiler room brawl was next and man was it brutual.
As usual, Foley took some hard bumps in this one.  He was chokeslammed into tables with glass on top of them and had a table fall on top of him.  Again, real brutal and good effort by both men. 10/10
6.  Triple H vs X-Pac
 Very emotinal and good techincal match.  I don't know if people have been so used to hardcore wrestling that they forgot what real wrestling action is all about.  X-Pac has suffer some real severe neck problems and Triple H uses that has his target.  Of course the idiots in the crowd chanted boring and some of the reviewers didn't think to highly of it, but it was a good actual wrestling match.  X-pac fought back until when the ref got knocked out which allowed chyna to jump x-pac and give HHH the advantage until Kane came out and chokeslammed both Chyna and HHH and set them both up for the bronco buster.  X-pac did just that!  First he gave it to HHH and then chyna but HHH quickly got up and delivered the pedigree.  Match over.  9/10
7.  Undertaker vs Ken Shamrock
 Another basic wrestling match.  I have to admit I did got a little bored watching this.  Undertaker did alright but Shamrock really stunk this match up by constantly trying to go for the ankle lock.  'Taker wins and Bradshaw lays into Shamrock with the baseball bat.  Rating 3/10
8.  Stone cold vs Rock with Shane O Mac as ref
On heat, shane made it a no-holds barred match.  After Austin beat the rock at WM 15, Austin became heavyweight champ but still wanted back his smoking skull belt which was in the possession of shane o mac.  Anyway, Shane promised he would be fair and he does that in the opening part of the match but in the end showed his true colors.  Lots of Action in this one. They tear up the enterance way and austin gets rock-bottomed threw a table. Rock tried to add insult by grabbing a camera and talking trash to the Austin.  As Rock has the camera to the fans, Austin gets up and stuns Rock on the announcer's table.
Vince comes out and clock his son in the face with the smoking skull belt and Austin finishs off the rock to remain champ.
As Vince was watching Austin celebrating in the ring, Undertaker kidnapped stephanie.  Match gets a 9/10.
Overall a good show by WWF after a disappointing WrestleMania 15.
I would recommend this tape to any wrestling fan.  Mainly, for the variety of matches that it had which is very hard to find in PPV's these days.",1044316800,3,4395,4.34809348093481

1231331,5,B00000J11L,"Although there were some really boring matches, like the Undertaker vs. Shamrock match, I absolutely love this PPV.  There are really three good reasons for you to buy this tape.  These reasons are, Boiler room brawl, hardcore, and Wrestlemania return match.
Boiler Room Brawl: Mankind vs. Big Show
I was in awe at this match.  The first one (Undertaker vs. Mankind) was one of my favorite matches.  This one had a lot to live up to.  It did a pretty good job.  It was a really physical and violent match.  Everyone needs to experience viewing this.
Hardcore title match: Hardcore Holly vs. Al Snow
These two were probably the best the WWF ever had in their hardcore division, and at the time, they had put on some ECW worthy matches.  This one went everywhere in and out of the arena.  They eventually ended up in a dumpster, and on top of cars.  It was great.
Wrestlemania re-match: Stone Cold vs. The Rock
Both of these men put on legendary matches when they are pitted against eachother. I personally thought the WM 15 match was awesome, and this match is equal, if not better, than the WM one.  One particular highlight is ""the Rock's Cam"".  Believe me, it's great, and I hate the Rock.
All in all, this tape is great.  BUY IT!",1005436800,,1232,4.495495495495495
1231332,4,B00000J11L,I rented this tape and really want to buy it soon. I thought every match was good. Every person who said this was not good and only worht renting was wrong. I listened to them though and they were wrong it was pretty solid. The rock austin and the hardcore match between al snow and hardcore holly was good. The boiler room brawl was exactly wat it says a great brawl. It really brought out the best in both of them. You should buy this know.,989280000,,442,4.151162790697675
1231333,3,B00000J11L,"The Brood vs. Acolytes/Mideon was a watchable opener but nothing more than that. The hardcore title match between Al Snow and Hardcore Holly was really good for a hardcore match... both guys worked very hard. Godfather vs. Goldust sucked a** but if you're into wrestling more for a laugh than for good actual wrestling then you might like it. The New Age Outlaws versus JJ and Owen tag match was quite weak because well the outlaws are horrible wrestlers. The Boiler Room Brawl between The Big Show and Mankind was very entertaining with some cool spots (even though the match was recorded earlier in the day of the event). HHH vs. Xpac was quite the good match with some solid psychology. I don't mind seeing submission holds and matwork at all but when it's done through the entire match I tend not to enjoy it... that's all the Ken Shamrock vs. Undertaker match was... submissions, mat work and reversals through it all... I found it to be boring... maybe it's because Undertaker is a brawler but was trying to be a mat technician. As for The Rock vs. Steve Austin main event I was pretty much impressed... a very good brawl.
Not a bad show... worth a rental but not worth buying in my opinion.",973814400,,1197,4.572093023255814
1231334,5,B00000J11L,"This was a fantastic PPV.  The first match was slow but the rest were great.  The Hardcore match between Al Snow and Hardcore Holly was great.  The IC match between the Godfather and Goldustwas funny.  The Boiler Room  Brawl between The big Show  and Mankind was awesome. They pulled out all  the stop in a brutal match.  The Title match between Stone Cold Steve  Austin and The Rock stole the show.

1231336,4,B00000J11L,"""Backlash"" has three standout matches.  I enjoyed Bob Holly vs. Al Snow, mainly for the fantastic table bump near the end.  The boiler room brawl was simply amazing.  I've never been a fan of Paul Wight, due to his  horrible workrate and overall ackwardness, but he took a fair share of the  bumps.  Mick Foley, as usual, took some sick bumps (the chokeslam off a  ladder through two tables and glass comes to mind).  The main event was  also an excellent match, enjoyable to say the least.  Now, most of the rest  of the card was simply horrible.  Ken Shamrock vs. Undertaker was basically  just one long resthold, and the same could be said for HHH vs. X-Pac.  But  what are fast-forward buttons for?  If you're the type of person that wants  a video great from beginning to end, avoid this one, but if you're looking  for a tape with a few classic matches, and a great number of average at  best matches, go for ""Backlash"".  I'm certainly glad I did.",950918400,,953,4.461988304093567
7911795,5,B00000J11L,"1.) The Ministry (Bradshaw, Faarooq, and Mideon) vs The Brood (Edge, Christian, and Gangrel)

This match all took place after Undertaker became very abusive towards Christian after being forced to reveal to Ken Shamrock the whereabouts of Stephanie McMahon on a previous Raw. The Brood became tiresome of Undertaker's abuse and got kicked out of the Ministry of Darkness. Not a bad match but could've been better in some areas. Viscera interferes at the end and takes out Christian. Bradshaw hits a Clothesline From Hell on Gangrel for the win.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Al Snow vs Hardcore Holly (c)

The 2 start off with back and forth action, beating each other with just about any kind of weapon they can grab. Eventually a hockey stick comes into play, which Snow uses to pulverize Holly with. The match ends up heading to the backstage area, where Holly tosses Snow into a zamboni. Holly attempts to throw a sink at Snow, but Snow blasts a water hose in his face. The match heads out to the parking lot and even inside the production truck for a quick minute. Snow knocks Holly off the ledge of the truck on to the roof of a truck, followed with an elbow drop off the ledge onto Holly for a close 2 count. The match heads back to the ring with Snow getting Holly set up on a table. Holly gets up in time and nails Snow with a frying pan before suplexing him off the top turnbuckle through the table for a close 2 count. Snow gets to his feet and grabs Head and nails Holly with it before making the pinfall for the win. Great match and one of the best Hardcore matches to take place on a PPV

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Goldust w/The Blue Meanie vs The Godfather (c) w/The Hos

The Blue Meanie tries to taunt The Hos, distracting Godfather, allowing Goldust to get a slight advantage. Godfather comes back with the offense but it's halted after Blue Meanie grabs his foot. Blue Meanie hands Goldust powder to toss in Godfather's face, while he distracts the referee. Goldust's plan backfires as Godfather sends the powder, flying back into the face of Goldust, blinding him. Blue Meanie jumps in and tries to help a blind Goldust, but the Bizzare One accidentally hits him, thinking it was Godfather. Goldust, still blinded by the powder, continues to pulverize Blue Meanie over in a corner. Goldust sets Blue Meanie up in a corner and nails the Shattered Dreams on his protege, much to the humor from The Godfather and the crowd. Godfather superkicks Goldust and goes for the pin, only to block a pin break from Blue Meanie. Godfather throws Blue Meanie into Goldust in a corner and hits a Ho Train on both of them. Godfather hits a Death Valley Driver on Goldust for the win to retain the championship. Average, short match. It was more comical than anything but still enjoyable

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) The New Age Outlaws vs Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett w/Debra - Winners become #1 Contenders to Tag Team Championships

Phenomenal tag team match-up from these 2. This match had a nice work rate, had some nice back and forth competitive tag action from both teams, and got a nice amount of time on the card. Billy Gunn counters a Figure 4 Leg Lock from Jarrett and hits a Fameasser on Owen who had Dogg in a Sharpshooter for the win. Really good tag team match. It's unfortunate looking back on it though to know that this would be Owen's last PPV appearance ever. Billy Gunn moons the crowd after the match

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Boiler Room Brawl: Big Show vs Mankind

This was only the second Boiler Room Brawl to take place. The last one happened at the 1996 SummerSlam which was won by Mankind. Mankind jumps Show the moment he enters the boiler room and tries to force him inside a high voltage closet. Damn. Show escapes and throws a table at Mankind. Mankind comes back and comes close to knocking Show down with several boards, but a boot to the face from Show stops his momentum. Lots more competitive back and forth brawling. Show looks to be on his way to leaving the boiler room, but Mankind gets up and forcefully slams a plate of glass over Show's head. Mankind grabs a ladder and starts climbing it, trying to reach something, but Show is up and Chokeslams Foley through a table of boxes and glass. Both Foley and Show are now bleeding from being cut from the glass. Mankind grabs a pole and breaks off a pipe with it that sends steam or freon blasting into Show's face. Mankind buries Show under a load of pipes and crawls (leaving bloody hand prints behind) out of the boiler room for the win. Mankind is immediately jumped by Big Boss Man and Test who beat Foley back into the boiler room. Show rises from the pipes and knocks out Test and chases after Boss Man. Mankind revives and puts Mr. Socko on and puts the Mandible Claw on Test to end the segment. I'd say this Boiler Room Brawl was much better than the one from 1996. There was so much going on here, a whole lot of bumps, and incredibly violent. One of the bloodiest brawls I'd say I've ever seen in WWF.

7911799,5,B00000J11L,"Another old tape from the WWF Attitude Era that I found in my collection of wrestling events in the first ever WWF Backlash. The thing that I remember most about this event was that this event had something to prove due to the fact that WrestleMania XV failed to live up to all the expectations that it had. During this time, Stone Cold Steve Austin had regained the WWF Championship but wanted his original ""Smoking Skull"" Belt back that was currently in the possession of The Rock...which leads to this rematch with the twist here being that Shane McMahon will be the guest referee. Also, Shane's dad, Vince McMahon was removed from his own Corporation by his son, Shane, while at the same time battling the Undertaker's Ministry of Darkness & for those don't remember, Taker announced that there would be a tradegy before the night is over.

The Acolytes & Mideon vs The Brood. The story here was that Christian dropped the ball according to the Undertaker's orders when kidnapping Stephanie McMahon that lead to him along with Edge & Gangrel being removed from the Ministry. Good opener here as Edge & Christian had a good chemistry with Faarooq & Bradshaw while Mideon & Gangrel did just enough to contribute but not slow down the action. With interference from Viscera at the end, this was a good match to start the show.

Hardcore Champion Hardcore Holly vs Al Snow. Just like their previous & future encounters, they picked up right where they left off as they brawled around the arena, went backstage & even ended up going outside to fight in the parking lot to the point where they ended up fighting in the dumpster. They eventually returned to the ring with weapons like trash cans, a fire extinguisher & even a table that lead to the moment where Holly suplexed Al off the turnbuckle through it before Al Snow used his ""Head"" to win the title.

Intercontinental Champion The Godfather vs Goldust. Unlike how the Intercontinental title is usually showcased, this was more of a comedic match with moments like Blue Meanie getting involved that lead to a moment where Goldust was blinded but delivered the ""shattered dreams"" to him thinking it was Godfather. Again, just a comedic but entertaining match.

New Age Outlaws vs Owen Hart & Jeff Jarrett. Unfortunately, this turned out to be Owen's last WWF PPV match as he would die a month later at Over The Edge. Anyways, this was a great tag team match that really showcased how underrated of a team that Owen & Jarrett were at this time while during this period, the Outlaws were perhaps the best tag team in the WWF.

Boiler Room Brawl: Mankind vs The Big Show. These two heavily made up for their dull WrestleMania match as this one was allowed to stand out in a different way in comparison to the first one. They battled around the Boiler room with moments like Mankind sitting on a carriage & literally being thrown into a wall that lead to a platform landing on top of him, Mankind hitting Show in the head with a glass window, Mankind getting chokeslammed off a ladder through a table with a glass on it, & Big Show being thrown into a pile of steel pipes. Again, this really delivered what was advertised.

Triple H vs X-Pac. At WrestleMania, Triple H turned on X-Pac so this was X-Pac's chance to get some redemption. I don't recall these two ever facing off at this point past their KOTR qualifying matches a year prior so this was a really good match with Triple H focusing on X-Pac's neck for a majority of the match that lead to him using submission holds that he hadn't used before along with Chyna getting involved from time to time. X-Pac showed heart & with a cameo from Kane towards the end, this was a solid encounter between these two.

The Undertaker vs Ken Shamrock. This feud was based off Undertaker's Ministry not only kidnapping Stephanie but also Ken's sister, Ryan Shamrock along with Ken showing his alliance towards Vince McMahon. Honestly, I have no idea what was wrong with this crowd because this was a great technical wrestling match with Taker focusing on Shamrock's back while Shamrock targeted Taker's leg with various submission holds to the point that you could hear the screams of pain from Taker. Unlike how the Hell In A Cell match was at WrestleMania, this was a better performance for Undertaker & one of the more underrated matches of the night.

No Holds Barred: WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Rock w/Special Referee Shane McMahon. This was the match that topped their WrestleMania match as these two are always entertaining to watch & really took advantage of the ""No Holds Barred"" rules. They brawled around the arena to the point where they went to the entrance way & began to take turns in breaking down the set before they went back to ringside with moments like the Rock Bottom through the table that lead to the hilarious debut of the ""Rock-Cam"" along with Shane clearly showing favoritism to the Rock. The ending came with Vince McMahon doing something that most fans didn't think he would do before Austin was able to not only win the match but get back his belt.

Overall, this event had a better match quality than WrestleMania & considering how most of the events of 1999 turned out to be, this was one of the best events of the year & great way to start the Backlash series. I highly recommend.",1208131200,,5325,4.632415254237288
