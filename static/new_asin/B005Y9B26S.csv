A well written musical score that works very well. This film won't disappoint. If you're a fan of ""Indie"" films a must see.",1325980800,3,281,4.73469387755102
4905327,5,B005Y9B26S,"Not really a Horror Film (by today's blood-n-guts standards).  Even Redbox lists it as Drama.  Acting was first rate.  Story was ""out there"" but that's what I REALLY liked about it.  Much better than I expected.",1324857600,,211,4.777777777777778
4905328,2,B005Y9B26S,"The cast does the best it can, but this story is just too wacky to believe or even to make the viewer suspend disbelief.  A grieving woman who works in a hospital revives a dead man with a violent history and then the ghost of the house she is renting inhabits the body until the dead guy repo's his body.  Did you get that?

Um.....yeah.",1324252800,,338,4.1692307692307695
4905329,2,B005Y9B26S,"I was in the mood for a good 2 1/2 star movie (sometimes they're just what you need), and rented this one. (As I write, it is out of stock on Amazon, it's the first day of the movie's release to DVD). The plot concept was interesting to me, but the movie is so implausible, that I ended up stopping it well before it was half over. Implausible even for a ghost movie? That's pretty implausible. And didn't mind the low-budget look, mostly refreshing actually, but shouldn't doctors wear badges and have stethoscopes? Liked the acting, though, and very realistic main character, Barbara.",1323820800,,586,4.699029126213592

4905338,2,B005Y9B26S,"I wanted to like this. I like Robin Wiegert of Deadwood and Lost fame, and Wes Studi of Dances WIth Wolves, Last of the Mohicans, and Mystery Men fame, but this movie was just plain silly and uninteresting, like a second-rate, throw-away Harlequin romance put on film. The premise might have been interesting had the plot details, dialogue and story been handled more carefully. It ended up feeling like an After School Special for bored housewives. Truly a shame, as the talents of the principal players really went to waste. I watched it through to the end anyway, because I love the cottage and the setting, which is why I gave this two stars instead of one. But I would never repeat it, nor can I reccomend it to anyone.",1481241600,,724,4.576923076923077

4905344,3,B005Y9B26S,"I couldn't decide whether to give this a 3 or 4. This wasn't bad...it just was not really ""horror"". It reminded me a Lifetime TV Movie version of horror. Or possible a romance novel with a supernatural twist. Very dramatic and a bit inexplicably thick emotionally. The background music throughout was a killer for how much better it *could* have been though. That music was so cheesy that it ruined and distracted from an otherwise decent script and good acting. If it would not have been marketed as horror or had the awful music, I would have given it a 4 even though I am not a romance novel reader. Again...not awful, but just go into it knowing it is more like a romantic supernatural drama and do not expect horror.",1480204800,2,721,4.511450381679389
4905345,3,B005Y9B26S,"This movie seems more like a made for TV movie... It's watchable if you have nothing better to do,  but not worth paying for.",1480204800,,125,4.208333333333333
4905346,4,B005Y9B26S,This movie is to die for. As long as a wealthy surgeon chick can bring you back and pay all your bills while you stay at home and pretend like you got PTSD,1479945600,,155,3.727272727272727
4905347,3,B005Y9B26S,"This would have been great if I had watched it in the 1960's. Now it is too slow, too predictable and too many clichs. Acting is credible and the directing is also good but the movie is a little boring. This could have been a good 30 minute 'twilight zone' episode.",1479600000,5,265,4.215686274509804
4905348,5,B005Y9B26S,"I'm surprised and disappointed at how few reviews there are of The Undying, a tale of the gentle soul of a Confederate soldier who is given a new life .... in the body of a psychopath. The doctor, Barbara, without malice, sneaks a braindead killer's body to her house and waits for the soldier's ghost to take possession. The title is unfortunate and makes this sound like a low budget B movie.  However, it's well acted and her little rented house is quaint, surrounded by pleasant scenery.  No spoilers here ~ just a 5 star recommendation for this lost gem.",1479254400,7,559,4.58

4905353,4,B005Y9B26S,Loved the theme as it is hard to find civil war/paranormal/romance.  A movie you can really get lost in if you are into civil war era and ghosts.,1391990400,4,145,4.178571428571429

4905355,1,B005Y9B26S,"The fiance of a female physician, while taking a photo of her, steps back off of a curb and gets killed by a passing truck. If all that seems unlikely, improbable and movie made up then you are in for a treat because the rest of the movie follows that script obediently. The physician decides that she needs an isolated cabin to live in when she starts her new job and it so happens the cabin comes complete with the ghost of a civil war soldier. The physician is caring for a not-so-nice patient who eventually dies so she carts his body off to her cabin hoping that the ghost will have a new bodily home.

Robotic TV soaps' style acting, i.e. filmography consisting of TV series, shorts and junk movies didn't help the script out at all. It's hard to connect with the character physician when she acts like a child with a new toy with regard to the newly inhabited body. The script didn't help it self out either with effects like someone pressing their face against the shower curtain to represent a ghost or a cheap CGI of a face appearing in fireplace smoke or the eyes moving in a photo of the soldier. Cheap production indicator of no subtitles to help with poor audio or for those with hearing issues.",1333152000,,1209,4.397321428571429
4905356,3,B005Y9B26S,"This is an interesting film that I recommend for genre fans.
The performances are fine and it has a macabre atmosphere.",1329609600,,119,4.714285714285714
4905357,3,B005Y9B26S,"The Undying is a film that tells a very simple story; thankfully, it does not pretend to be more than it is. It just quietly tells its story.

The film, marketed as a horror movie, appears at first to be exactly that. Barbara Haughton, seeking to put the tragic death of her fianc behind her, moves to a new home to get away from the past. Soon, strange things begin to transpire as it turns out that the house is haunted by the ghost of a Civil War soldier. The film must be praised for its subtle uses of fear: there's no blood and gore here, but uncanny occurrences - such as the reflection in a shard of glass of a man who isn't actually there - that actually turn out to be terrifying in their realism. Soon, Barbara begins to investigate, even venturing online to search ""how to help a ghost,"" just as, in every scary film, the main character goes online to research the supernatural.

Then the movie takes a turn: Barbara arranges for the ghost, Elijah, to take over the body of Jason Donovan, a man who recently died in the hospital she works at. From a scary film, this movie becomes a romantic drama. Through the centuries, Barbara and Elijah reach towards each other and help each to forget their past and find love. Anyone who's ever read anything about ghosts knows that they are usually trapped on earth through a tragic death that they must come to peace with, and such is the case here. Barbara helps Elijah accept the events that led to his end, and, in the process, finds a new life for herself.

This isn't a particularly complex or a particularly innovative idea, of course. It's an unassuming story. The movie does contain plot and even suspense: the looming question of whether or not the personality of the man whose body Elijah has taken remains, whether it'll show itself, and the police on Barbara's tracks about the missing body from the hospital. But, for the most part, the story focuses on the love between the two characters. It's simple, sweet, predictable, and well done if that kind of thing is one's cup of tea.

Robin Weigert (Barbara) - who mostly has TV roles to her name - isn't exceptional in her role, but she does what the part demands and she's believable. More importantly, though, she looks normal. She doesn't look like she comes from Hollywood, and it's a refreshing change. Anthony Carrigan has the challenge of having to balance two personalities - Elijah's and Donovan's, a gentleman's and an abusive husband's - and he rises to that challenge. The story is supported by one of the most beautiful soundtracks I have ever heard: melancholy, poetic, lively, and haunting. In the end, however, the film can be characterized by its unassuming simplicity.

4905358,5,B005Y9B26S,"Excellent movie, highly recommended. The supernatural theme created lots of tension and suspense without the excessive gore typical in this genre, while my wife ws fascinated by the romance that developed between Barbara and the ghost. There's something in this film for everyone.",1326499200,3,280,5.534883720930233
4905359,4,B005Y9B26S,"I liked this movie a lot.  It had some scares, an interesting take on the Frankenstein mythos, good fight scenes and a cool cast.  I especially liked the ending but I won't spoil it by saying anything.  Hanging a romance on a horror movie frame kept me involved and it's what my girlfriend was really into.",1326326400,5,306,4.428571428571429
8489157,3,B005Y9B26S,Don't have lifetime movie channel? This is your fix. The acting was good but the overall movie was meh at best.  Watched it for free but wouldn't pay money to see it.  Not even at redbox.,1529193600,,187,4.166666666666667

8489159,1,B005Y9B26S,"Terrible.  Slow, overacted.  Very slow, predictable ""love story"" with a lame ghost tossed in.  The chemistry between the two actors is nonexistent.  And the accent of the ghost is cringe-worthy.  Also, the music = the scenes were so unmoving that whenever ANY slight drama occurred, the music chimed in with a piercing piano and violin.  After a few times, it was laughable.

It takes a really great or really terrible film to get me to bother to write a review.  Even free, this movie isn't worth it.",1498262400,,501,4.67816091954023
