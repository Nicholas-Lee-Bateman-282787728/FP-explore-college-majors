8124110,4,B000FKP23U,"Another great episode of the best showcase of mansions I've ever known. The mansions featured in this episode of America's castles ""Windy City Estates"" is not as exciting as the episodes which feature the far more opulent homes of the people like the Vanderbilts, Post, Flagler or Hearst, but still a great show perhaps of special interest for those in the Chicagoland area. An interesting aspect of this installment is the fact that 2 of the homes featured came to their owners as a result of the Great Depression. The story of the Cuneo estate is a good one because the home was at one time owned by Samuel Insul and because of John Cuneo's relationship with William Randolph Hearst. Robert McCormick's Cantigny is a relatively humble interior with a classic, beautiful exterior. I recommend this episode.",1293926400,,807,4.897810218978102
