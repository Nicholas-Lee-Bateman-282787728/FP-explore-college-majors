7907935,5,B00000F8ON,"This film is an absorbing panorama of pointless lives and decaying society - as symbolized by people throwing away their money in a state of hypnosis at a Las Vegas casino. However Q of D is distinguished by the warmth of its colors and images - and by its mostly non-actor cast, who come off as nice people for the most part. This element gives the film a dimension which is lacking in purely satirical works like Fellini's 8 1/2.  When the main character leaves the wedding and gets into a car with a stranger - I could not resolve whether it was a death wish - or her hope that somewhere there's a better world.",1334966400,,614,4.293103448275862

7907938,1,B00000F8ON,"As I progress with this Amazon review thing, I will try to give every break I can to independently made films.  Because they're well, so independent, I guess.  I've seen my share of them, and liked quite a few, but with this film, one can see why a studio would be reluctant to drop a few mil because some director wants to show her sister being a total mope for over an hour.
I guess I'm supposed to appreciate that something in this person's life caused her to lead a non-existence, and because it's an ""art"" movie, of course we're not going to be told what it is.  And I guess in order to appreciate her pain, we have to experience what she has to endure in her day-by-day life.
I would also guess that Las Vegas was chosen as the location for the film because of it's reputation as a soulless, money-grubbing town.  This is illustrated in a scene, that lasts about 1/3 of the film, that just shows her at work.  All the closeups show her taking the customer's money, but never paying out winners.  Through this entire scene, she does not smile or relate to the customers once.  In fact, she does not smile once in the entire film.
I live in Las Vegas, and it took awhile to figure out where she worked.  We get a quick ""product placement"" of her change apron showing Bob Stupak's Vegas World.  Now this film was shot over a dozen years ago, and I will admit that Vegas World was one of the most Godawful, gaudy casinos in town.  And of course the director picks the dumpiest, most desolate places in town where she lives and does other things with her life, which is not much.
But tell you what.  Vegas World has since been replaced with the much more interesting Stratosphere.  And yes, there is a part of Vegas that can be Boulevard of Broken Dreams, but there is a much bigger part of the town, then and now, that's a rollicking fun place to be.  None of this, of course, is conveyed here.
Finally, a dealer's job can be repetitive, but it's a way for a person with minimal skills, and no goals in life,  to earn a decent living.  Our party chick of a main character certainly qualifies here, and should be grateful she's got a job.  A good dealer can earn more tips by at least conveying friendliness, but with this one, I would have changed tables after a few hands.  Part of a dealer's job is to help the customer have a good time even if you are taking their money.  If I were the casino, I'd say, here, go clean some toilets for lower pay if that's what you want to convey. I'm not forcing you to take this job, so leave your problems at home.
I'm sure I'm missing the point.  I'm just supposed to try and understand her pain.  But unless you've been through the Holocaust, and even if you have been, get on with your life.
I have a moody, pouty six-year-old.  I think I'll follow him around for a few days and try to release it as art.",1015372800,2,2848,4.256505576208179
7907939,4,B00000F8ON,"Produced, written and directed by Nina Menkes, ""Queen of Diamonds"" is a demanding 77-minute film, which requires attention and contemplation to arrive at a semblance of meaning. The director labels it ""a minimalist post-pop emotional x-ray of the U.S.,"" and clearly the first half of the description applies.  For the most part the camera remains quite static, framing a scene with minimal attempt to influence our perceptions of what is transpiring.  The rare close ups are of the faces of the gamblers or of the hands of the ""heroine"" dealing cards at the black jack table or picking at her food.  If we get close to seeing her face her arm invariably covers it; clearly we are not supposed to get close enough to see.  The dialogue is also almost maddeningly sparse throughout the film, often heard indistinctly, and never provides any meaningful information for unraveling what is going on.  Made in 1991, ""Queen of Diamonds"" reveals a Las Vegas black jack dealer, portrayed by Tinka Menkes, and treats us to a bleak but compelling portrait of alienation, which for me is best captured in the shot of her standing in front of the ""Wheel of Fortune"" at the casino waiting dispassionately for someone to come up and play.
This is film where we are told nothing and are never quite sure what we are being shown at any given moment.  However, there is a rhythm to the scenes that begins to provide some framework for accessing the film's meaning as we alternate between the quiet of her apartment and the bustle of the casino.  Even when the film moves beyond those two primary settings the patterns remains constant of alternating scenes of sound (she sits in a bar drinking while ""Moonlight Serenade"" plays loudly) with those of eerie quiet (she is part of a crowd that watches a dead body being carted off the street).  She works mainly as a black jack dealer.  Eventually we discover she has a husband who has been missing for several months and sometimes she makes an effort to find him (she is neither clear on the details nor especially motivated to search for him).  She also takes care of an old man who lives in a motel.  Then she goes back to dealing black jack and the routine continues.  Against this relentless cycle the attempts to break away from the routine stand out starkly, for both their oddity and their failure to produce a spark.  Sitting on a bench waiting for a bus a man sings to her, to no effect.  On the shores of a lake she another man asks her to go for a walk and we cut to the pair watching a burning palm tree.  After a while the man walks away, but she continues to watch it burn.  Is she barely going through the motions out of a sense of routine or simply resigned to her fate?  Does she feel any pain or take any pleasure out of anything she does?
""Queen of Diamonds"" is a cinematic Rorschach test, where the meaning and significance is going to come from the viewer, provoked by what is being shown on the screen.  Those who demand explanations, who want obvious narrative structure and crystal clear resolutions, are going to be extremely frustrated by this film.  This film plays around the edges of a life that is being lived on the periphery.  ""Queen of Diamonds"" is not for everybody, but rather for those who enjoy an above average example of the contemporary American art film and who are willing to be involved in the viewing experience.  I have changed my mind several times as to what I think is ""really going on"" in this film, but then I have no problem with a fluid reading of a cinematic text.  Does the fact the end credits are in a gothic type hint at an ironic frame of reference?  Certainly the turning Queen of Diamonds card at the beginning reflects the film's rhythm, or is that pushing the symbolism too much?  As I said, this is a most demanding film, but not without its rewards.",1009065600,4,3842,4.534782608695652
