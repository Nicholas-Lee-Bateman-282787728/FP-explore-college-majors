8663080,5,B00L1GKV6U,"The movie is about a typically curious and playful young boy who wants to know about his mother.  His father is an exceptional detective and he takes what he learned from his father and puts it to use to find the clues about her.  In his journey he meets his grandparents who lead him to more clues about his mother.  In the end he not only finds out about his mother, but he also finds out where he was born.  All this happens right before his Bar Mitzvah.  Very entertaining and with fun action scenes, I do recommend to anyone.",1492646400,,530,4.26
8663081,5,B00L1GKV6U,"This was a fun movie! It has an interesting storyline with many twists. The 60's style music was great too. And there was no sex, nudity, or profanity. At one point there is mention of the famous criminal who had ""a thousand different lovers"".  At another, there is a short discussion of a suicide. But overall, it makes for a nice family movie. The only thing is that the dialogue moves between Dutch and English. During the Dutch parts, there are subtitles and they move at a pretty quick pace, so younger kids might get frustrated if they can't keep up. But I would think that most kids 12 or above should be fine with reading the subtitles.

I also liked the fact that Nono's father's girlfriend was not a typically slender, beautiful actress. It was refreshing to see an average looking person in a main role. Her character was great--funny, smart and loving. Finally, there is a happy ending. All in all, a wonderful, apparently, hidden gem of a movie. I hemmed and hawed for a while about getting this movie. I'm glad I finally did.",1492646400,,1039,4.550802139037433

By far the best Dutch film I have ever seen.",1429488000,,131,5.285714285714286
