3610968,4,B001GFBO0S,"A funny yet poignant and provocative film, filled with facts, that causes all but the most narrow-minded, small-minded, simple-minded, conservative Lemmings (like those featured in Bill Maher's film, ""Religulous""), and those who are obtuse enough to believe in our federal government's propaganda that attempts to indoctrinate people about the ""horrors"" of drugs: folks like another reviewer of this DVD - maxGamer.

At the end of his ""review,"" he wrote: ""We had a big anti-smoking (tobacco) campaign and it worked.
When will we see the big anti-weed campaign?""

I'll provide the answer - NEVER!

You see, comparing tobacco to marijuana is like comparing apples to, well, giraffes' tongues, or anything else so patently ridiculous that it has absolutely no reasonable connection.  For example, tobacco has no useful benefit, causes incredible addiction, and ultimately kills and/or sickens a large percentage of its addicts.  Marijuana, on the other hand, possesses a plethora of uses - medical and otherwise - is NOT addictive, and does not sicken or kill its users.  maxGamer would know this if he had read any of the definitive books written on the subject (i.e. ""Waiting to Inhale), or the numerous medical studies conducted across the planet.  His typical, conservative, knee-jerk, I-believe-everything-the-government-tells-me reaction - thankfully - is NOT held by OVER EIGHTY PERCENT of Americans.

In a time when the U.S. education system ranks somewhere around 24th in the world (Costa Rica - a Third-World country - has a lower illiteracy rate), it's heartening to see that the vast majority of our population is still smart enough, and informed enough to not be fooled by Big Tobacco, Big Pharmacy, and Big Brother, all of whom are just about the only entities still trying (without success) to convince us otherwise.  Ultimately, they are losing this foolish, profit-driven, propaganda campaign just like the ""War on Drugs"" has been a losing proposition since the day it began.

I'd suggest that if maxGamer is truly interested in becoming enlightened about marijuana, he should 1) smoke some, and/or 2) read the previously mentioned ""Waiting to Inhale,"" and watch the documentary ""American Drug War: The Last White Hope,"" and ""The Union: The Business Behind Getting High"" just for starters.  He should then Google numerous pieces of research and studies done by people who actually KNOW about which they speak - scientists and doctors, and study both Eastern and Western history of the past six-thousand years.  Then, once he actually has the FACTS, he can write another review.  Hopefully, that review will begin something like this...""I apologize for wasting the time of those unfortunate souls who actually read my previous review.  Furthermore, I actually can now write an informed review, and it goes something like this....""  (I will refrain from wishing cancer on him so that he can obtain first-hand knowledge of marijuana's usefulness and benefits: I'm not so fanatical about conversion to my point of view as to employ the use of cruelty as a learning tool.)",1250640000,5,3081,5.246435845213849
3610969,4,B001GFBO0S,"Has a lot of good facts and information but the arrangement does seem a bit biased towards pro-cannabis. I would of liked to see more anti-cannabis quotes, videos, etc. to help balance and show the outrageous ""factor"" of why cannabis is illegal. Overall it was a good film but seemed a little bit dated to me and I prefer the newer ""The Union"" documentary. The film comes off as a student's argument for the consequences of a current U.S. policy. I would of liked to see the inclusion of medical/scientific studies surrounding Cannabis.",1235001600,6,536,4.774193548387097
3610970,1,B001GFBO0S,"I should get an award for sitting through this. This movie should be lumped in with the old Marlboro man ads of the 70's and shown to kids.

Then fast forward to the days of lung cancer, paranoia, and dementia.

Before and after pictures would make all these ""Go smoke a little weed, its harmless!"" thinly veiled advertisments a little less damaging for my generation. We had a big anti-smoking (tobacco) campaign and it worked.
When will we see the big anti-weed campaign?",1233619200,3,473,4.686746987951807
3610971,5,B001GFBO0S,"I started watching this film with a whole lot of doubt and skepticism.  I am by no means radical in any way, and until recently was also anti-legalization.  John Holowach is a new filmmaker with a lot to say, and he does it without condescension, and with plenty of wry humor and wit.  Some parts of the film pissed me off, and others made me very sad.  It wasn't a boring, typical documentary by any means, and I highly recommend you check it out, if only because it's the first serious look at the War on Drugs that doesn't cop out to either extreme of the argument.",1226620800,17,568,4.280373831775701

8305248,1,B001GFBO0S,"This documentary though well narrated by its director is rather dim-witted in its arrangement and craft. There are a lot of interesting facts shared but what I found preposterous was the fact that the film postures its self as a pro Marijuana propaganda vehicle while this sites description seems to indicate that the film explores all sides of the subject, the positive and the negative. I my self was a serious Marijuana smoker in my teens. Even I know that though it may be somewhat safe for the casual user, it does pose serious risks to the over all health of long time heavy users. And there are many documented cases of long term brain chemical embalances resulting from chronic use of the drug over long periods of time. Many users will also admit that the drug causes extreme apathy, paranoia, anxiety, and other mental problems that can result in many years of emotional embalances and the need for treatment through therapy and numerous medications such as aprazolam(Xanax) and Seretonin re-uptake inhibitors(SSRIs Prozac, Zoloft) to treat mental problems or chemical brain damage that results. This documentary chooses to flaunt every opportunity to praise Marijuana and downplays the obvious negative impact of the drug. Dont be fooled, Marijuana is not a completely safe drug. While it has obvious health benefits for those with medical conditions such as glaucoma and Carpel tunnel syndrome, there are many ex users who are more than willing to discuss the darker side of Marijuana. Few ever listen sadly, until of course its too late.",1367971200,,1550,5.011627906976744
8305249,1,B001GFBO0S,"Don't waste your time on this one.  Beyond the fact that most of the information is out of date, it's uninformative for the time it was made.  I do not respect a documentarian that only hides behind a camera and carries the weight of public opinion who gives the answers they want to hear for their narrative.  A family from the south visiting the White House is not public opinion and should not be solely showcased.  Also the prison sequence is unrelated to the topic, and cheaply used for shock value.",1338940800,,504,4.5054945054945055

8305253,5,B001GFBO0S,"This is a well researched documentary on the history and plight of America's greatest illegal past time. Beginning with its origins and inception into American culture, this title explores the downward spiral of public acceptance as it was stigmatized by a new drug czar with ulterior motives. Overall, I learned a lot watching this, albeit my interest waned in some of the end parts. With so many goofy films regarding marijuana, this one is a worth watching more so for its objective stance than production value.",1282867200,,515,5.0
8305254,1,B001GFBO0S,"Rather than focusing on marijuana, its effects, uses, and the political & economic motives behind criminalizing it, and presenting any kind of coherent argument for legalization or decriminalization of marijuana, this scattershot documentary runs the gamut of showing human rights violations in privately run prisons to exposing a defunct drug treatment program to explaining the effectiveness of needle exchange programs in reducing transmission of AIDS to telling the unfortunate story of a physician prosecuted by the DEA for prescribing pain medication for his patients. The few minutes that are spent discussing marijuana either lump pot in with all other drugs (in an interview with a visiting professor of Economics at Harvard, which is presumably supposed to impress the viewer enough to accept his argument that ALL drugs should be legalized) or presenting the UMass professor who has been denied a permit to grow marijuana for medical research.

The title is completely misleading, and as any kind of a contribution to the argument for decriminalizing marijuana use in the United States, it is a serious disappointment. Save yourself 90 minutes and watch the far superior ""The Union: The Business Behind Getting High (2007).""",1265414400,23,1235,5.432291666666667
