3781475,5,B001RXB49K,"The negative reviews all say that they didn't know it was an animated series and thought it was the live action one from the 60's. That being the case, it's not fair that they give this set a bad review, when they probably never even watched it. It's an entertaining and high quality series that reinvents the main character and the villains. Compelling characters, well paced action and of course new gadgets for Bats. It has just the right mix of manga and traditional style animation. It may seem trivial in most animated series but the soundtrack to this one really adds to it's style and is done by none other than U2's The Edge! Characterwise we get a new, more physical Joker, a high tech hacker in Riddler, a super powered Bane and The Penguin gets a pair of scissorhanded female assassins as sidekicks. A couple seasons in we are introduced to a modern Robin and Batgirl with recurring roles as well as some new villains. The final season even has Superman, Green Arrow and other Justice Leaguers as Batman faces off against threats larger than Gotham's underworld.
A must own because you'll want to watch them again and again.",1371686400,24,1136,4.656716417910448
3781476,5,B001RXB49K,"Ignore the bad reviews, they all thought this was the 60's tv series. This is the excellent mid 2000's series that reinvented Batman and his rogue's gallery of villains. Strong animation, action packed stories and phenominal soundtrack by The Edge himself ! Batman fans should definitely pick this one up !!",1371686400,4,307,5.03921568627451
3781477,1,B001RXB49K,I put the batman complete series on my wish list with amazon.  The series I picked was for the original series batman tv shows.  What I received was cartoons and not the tv series of the original batman.  I am totally upset because amazon was bogus on the actual merchandise.  I have spent a lot of money on something I did not want. The worst part is that you have to jump through hoops to get a refund or exchange.  This is totally bogus...,1367366400,,442,4.214285714285714
3781478,5,B001RXB49K,I am so glad that i brought it . I was very happy about what i got and i watch over three times,1365379200,,95,3.1739130434782608
3781479,3,B001RXB49K,Good product. I like it.  Good DVD. Good . Good . Good . Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good !!,1361577600,,94,3.7
3781480,4,B001RXB49K,"I bought this series recently through Amazon.  FIRST OFF: This is the series from around 2003-2008.  This isn't the classic series from the 90's, so don't look here.

A friend of mine advised me to check it out.  I was skeptical at first by the DVD covers, but when I started watching it, I enjoyed the adventures.  The animation takes a more kiddy/cartoony approach (As best as I can describe it).  It's probably why some people aren't interested about it.  On the other hand, the story lines aren't bad at all.  There are some entertaining episodes in this series.

The creator of this series also takes an interesting spin on villians such as the Joker, the Riddler, & Bane.  It's a different approach, but it works for this series.

I prefer Batman: The Animated Series, but honestly The Batman isn't bad.  I won't sit here and compare the two since they both have their own takes.  Is The Batman the best series based on the iconic superhero?  No, but a solid approach to this dark defender of justice. Watch The Batman, and make your on conclusions.  If you like it, then own it.  Hopefully you'll enjoy it.",1346371200,,1113,4.573604060913706
3781481,3,B001RXB49K,Had to return unopened. It was not what was advertised. The cover photo led one to believe that you were getting the original series.,1337299200,,133,4.583333333333333
3781482,5,B001RXB49K,"This is not Batman:tas, but I am happy to find out it is the WB series ""the batman"". This was a completely different look at the batman universe, and always stood out to me. It was deffinetly my favorite batman cartoon series, and was hurt to find out of its cancel. I am glad to finally find this box set, rather than have to buy each season separately. Thanks amazon",1332028800,13,368,4.271428571428571
3781483,1,B001RXB49K,"I would hate for people to be fooled by the image like I was.

While the display art shows a picture of ""Batman the Animated Series"" the actually product is the cartoon from the WB
""The Batman""

(Which since this is technically a review, let me say, is NOWHERE near as good as ""Batman the Animated Series"")

I was confused why it said 5 seasons but I figured maybe amazon broke the seasons up to make it seem longer.
iTunes is known for doing such things in order to increase sales for ""more seasons"".

Please don't waste your money you can find the complete series brand new like I did on eBay for around 100-120 bucks!

REVISED!!!!!! 11/26/2012

I see some commentors getting on my case about being able to tell its not the animated series. When I brought it originally it WAS the picture of the animated series. I actually contacted amazon and pleaded that the picture be revised so nobody was tricked like I was. I was just trying to look out for fellow Batman fans as I wish someone had for me!",1303257600,37,1006,4.376344086021505
3781484,1,B001RXB49K,"This is not the 1960s, live-action Batman TV series starring Adam West and Burt Ward. This is an animated series from Warner Brothers ""Kid's Collection"".",1275609600,35,153,5.16

3781488,1,B001RXB49K,"The 1 star is for the DVD release, not the series. As much as I like the series, Warner Bros. decided to release these sets at 4:3 [Full Screen] aspect ratio instead of the original 16:9 [Widescreen] aspect ratio. Disappointing. To watch it in it's correct aspect ratio, go to Netflix.",1456963200,3,285,4.607843137254902

3781493,5,B001RXB49K,"My daughter is obsessed with Batman and this complete collection was perfect for her.  We can watch this show together and the complete collection is a good deal.  Some of the villains are overused and the introduction of the sidekicks is a bit strained (especially Robin's introduction, as Batgirl was introduced in the previous season and is clearly put on the back burner once Robin is in the picture).  It's a good animated series, with some great voice acting and interesting animation.",1453334400,,491,4.963414634146342
3781494,4,B001RXB49K,"In my opinion this is a stand alone batman animated set it does not go with batman beyond, batman the animated series, superman, justice league now, nor most of the movies. I purchased this item simply because it was once a Sat morning cartoon and now that they have canceled the WB I am trying to obtain all the animated shows that once aired in the early 2000 late 90's.",1451865600,,372,4.328571428571428
3781495,5,B001RXB49K,"I kind of like this version of The Batman which tells the origin of The Batman what happened before from this batman 2004-2008 to Batman animated series, then to then to batman beyond.",1445731200,,184,4.606060606060606

3781524,5,B001RXB49K,"It's a slow starter.  But in season one you get more characterization of Alfred (he's sassy) than in most Batman series.  Also they change the origins of some villians. Whether that's good or bad I leave up to you.  Season 3 we get Batgirl and she's a well rounded character who I found very engaging.  Season 4 sees Robin entering the picture and it is fun to see all the characters  working off each other.  Season 5 is where we get to see the  appearances of other favorite comic heroes.
Some of the villians I felt the changes to their back story took away more complex reasons to be criminals.  But some of the villians did get good back stories or at least remain very interesting.  This Batman isn't as disconnected (depressed) as other Batmans which leads to some relarionship dynamics shifts.  He's still got all the key Barman aspects, though. All things considered I was glad to get the series. And I will be rewatching it.",1440028800,2,934,4.538922155688622

  I specifically ordered 3 seasons of the live action series!!!  Upon investigation I learn the 1966 series has never been released on DVD, too bad I didn't know that a week ago!!

3781562,3,B001RXB49K,"I watched ALL five seasons, and, wow... This show while watchable, I cannot believe as to how childish and watered down this was compared to the 1990's version, and how ridiculously bad certain things were, like when The Joker (his voice sucked by the way) turned into Bane, yeah, anyways, I think what really got to me was the look of the show more than anything, it reminded me of an anime movie or something, which I HATE anime, I confess that I don't HATE this show. I was just VERY, VERY disappointed, being a Batman fan I expected more.

3781563,5,B001RXB49K,Wicked sick bad whatever you want to call it. This series is a modern side of batman never seen before not to childish yet not to adult. Just right for all ages. A lot of talent and time was put into this series love the old school batman 60's music mixed with modern day music. Excellent series even for the hardest to please concerning batman. Just wish they would have continued making an additional series would have bought them too. I consider this series a classic some day hope this was helpful hope you as an adult or child will enjoy them to. A must for all batman fans! Ps loved the episode when batman got his new whip (car) never expected it loved the villain in this episode to. Get ready for action if you buy this series!!!,1387584000,5,738,4.316546762589928
