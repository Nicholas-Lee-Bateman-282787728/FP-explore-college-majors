4684349,4,B005FQ1ONG,"By George! Shout! (along with Classic Media) presents onto you the Mr. Magoo on TV Collection! What will you find on it? You'll find the complete series of all 3 Mr. Magoo TV Shows (The Mr. Magoo Show, The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo, and What's New Mr. Magoo?) plus the TV Movie/Special Uncle Sam Magoo and all new extras! What it won't have? Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (but I found a listing that Classic Media will re-release it this year and I hope it has extras from the CE Blu-Ray). Now, I want to bring this to attention: The Mr. Magoo Show on this release might be the same from the previous individual and OOP set which means that some of the episodes featuring Magoo's houseboy Charlie might feature the dubbed soundtrack. That is, unless we help Jerry Beck stated on the August 10th 2011 airing of Stu's Show (radio program) that if we have original prints featuring Charlie and his original non-dubbed voice, we contact him immediately at Cartoonbrew.com. So your support counts to hopefully have the original versions on DVD! I've also heard on the August 10th 2011 airing of Stu's Show that the shows MIGHT be remastered though I'm not sure. Anyway, if you don't have Magoo or the previous Mr. Magoo Show set, then buy this now and you'll be a happy camper! And as for the theatrical (UPA) shorts, well they won't be on this set but, Shout! is looking into releasing them on DVD soon!",1313020800,57,1402,4.567460317460317

4684351,5,B005FQ1ONG,Great collection of Mr. Magoo.  I especially love the literary specials that were done like movies. Moby Dick and even stories like the Count of Monte Cristo where Magoo is not so bumbling.  All very well done.,1455148800,2,210,4.648648648648648

Just to specify, the original 1949-1959 theatrical shorts are not included in this. This is the the series that aired on television only.",1409961600,8,249,5.097560975609756
4684375,5,B005FQ1ONG,just great,1405555200,2,10,4.5
4684376,5,B005FQ1ONG,"Shout Factory did a great job putting all of the various Mr. Magoo TV shows together in one DVD set.  This is a perfect companion to the other Shout Factory ""Mr. Magoo Theatrical Collection"" DVD set.  They also corrected the voice of Charlie in the first 2 discs of the ""Mr. Magoo Show"" discs.  Unfortunately, the other two discs still have the annoying re-dubbed voice.  The delay in releasing this set was due to Shout Factory's search for the original un-dubbed voice.  I know others will still complain about the discs with the dubbed voice but I really appreciate Shout Factory's attempt in trying to restore Charlie's original voice on these cartoons.  Other companies wouldn't have cared less what the collectors wanted and we wouldn't have gotten any of the original dubs at all.  They probably would have eventually found the rest of them but who knows how many more years that would have been.  I'm glad they put in the time to restore these and that they went ahead and released these classic cartoons.",1405382400,24,1013,4.748571428571428
4684377,5,B005FQ1ONG,Sadly this represents many of todays politicians & family members.,1405036800,2,66,5.7
4684378,5,B005FQ1ONG,Better purchase this before the liberal PC crowd bans it. Contains a generous amount of political INcorrectness including guns!!! OH NO!!!!,1399593600,5,139,5.666666666666667
4684379,2,B005FQ1ONG,"Other than the rampant very heavy handed censorship this Mr. Magoo DVD set is awesome. I took off three stars for the horrid censorship that effectively ruins an otherwise awesome Mr. Magoo collection. Mr. Magoo was not always a NICE Politically Correct Man.  Anyone who knows and loves Mr. Magoo knows well his flaws and short comings.  Editing out all of Mr. Magoo's politically incorrect statements is like editing out all of Archie Bunkers politically incorrect statements.  What made Archie Bunker funny was the very fact that he was a man full of vile stereotypes, ignorance and socially retarded veiws. Without Archie Bunkers weird ignorant hate All In The Family would not have been worth watching.

Likewise Mr. Magoo was an old rich retired white man absolutely oblivious to the changing world around him.  Mr. Magoo was a man of privledge who drove where he pleased, said whatever he wanted and did as he deemed fit no matter what the consequences to himself and or others.  Face it Magoo like Archie Bunker in All In The Family was in part a racist, sexist politically incorrect white guy but thats part of what made him fun and funny.  Mr. Magoo was an old rich retired white guy with a strong 1940's racist mentality who seemed to live alone in his own world.  The world of social evolution and technical revolution had passed Mr. Magoo by and he was completely oblivious to it all which is, the essence of what makes Mr. Magoo totally funny.

The political correct movement has things all wrong.  Politically correct fools think you create a better world by pretending racism, sexism and homophobia never existed. The politically correct police edit out ugly things as if they never happened. The kind of Political Correctness that edits Mr. Magoo is more dangerous  to society than hate speech it censors because; it revises history as if the earlier hateful times never happened. Leave every hateful word in Mr. Magoo and other cartoons that show the United States Entertainment industries overt racist era. Let our countries racist history speak honestly without the muzzle the politically correct police would place on such speech. Cartoons like Mr. Magoo shaped and twisted minds of some white children teaching hate and hardened the hearts of minorities. Mr. Magoo was a funny but crude small minded man but even he has a part to play in revealing the real face of US culture in its more obvertly racist time.

Mr Magoo WAS NOT A NICE MAN by the todays stupid standards of political correctness so warn people like Warner Brothers does at the beginning of its animated cartoon shorts. Warner Brothers informs audiences that racial and other political incorrect content was left in to properly reflect the culture at the time the cartoons were made.  Warner Brothers further states it does not condone or support any of the statements but leaves them intact for historical accuracy or words much to that effect.  That same thing could have been done with Mr. Magoo disavow the vile things but leave them intact to speak honestly of the times in which they were made.  Just admit Mr. Magoo was a political incorrect man created in a politically in correct time. Mr. Magoo should have been left to speak for himself something he was good at. In the interest of preserving the history of his time Mr. Magoo should not have been censored. Politically Correct ideas have their place but they overstep when they muzzle the voice of history as has been done so tragically and effectively with Mr. Magoo: The Television Collection, 1960-1977.

Mr Magoo had an awesome lesson to teach us about culture in the far more racist hurtful United States culture I grew up in as a child. Mr magoo was anhonest man until the Politically Correct police silenced him here and we all lose because of it. Mr. Magoo was the best kind of teacher, since he reveals the culture of the 1970's using humor and humor is the best teacher. We remember long those things that make us laugh.  Unfortunately in this PAINFULLY CANSORED version of Mr. Magoo the politically correct police decided our nation is not mature enough to bare truthful witness to the realities of our shared racist, sexiest and homophobic past.  The political Correct nanny State Police to censor Mr. Magoo and other artwork like him forces us all to live slightly deminished by another teacher silenced and sacrificed on the blood soaked alter of political correctness.

I know this posting will get me many negatives so bring it on.  If this review gets published I've never remove it because; Censorship even in pursuit of the lofty goals of political correctness is still ALL WRONG!",1398038400,32,4647,4.836065573770492

4684394,5,B005FQ1ONG,Mr. Magoo is an iconic cartoon from my childhood.  I grew up watching this show and still love it even as I approach senior citizenhood.  This is a great product at a great price for anyone who still likes to re-visit the better parts of their childhood and for those who have never seen it....it's a treat that is well worth the price.,1384819200,4,336,4.317460317460317
4684395,5,B005FQ1ONG,"Big Shocker, Bloss! You're not missing that much without all of the original 60's Chinese stereotype dub. Fussy people. Complaining about censorship of an old cartoon. An inherently politically incorrect cartoon. A cartoon that basically is about a senile old man who is a menace to society because of his negligent blindness. One of the shows has a Chinese caricature which is actually an invention of the 1960s WASP imagination. Magoo's houseboy's speech impediment says more about American Anglos than it does Chinese. It seems silly but it is understandable how offensive it is. Or not. Is its total political incorrectness naive and charming or just ignorant and dated? Who cares, the real gold is on another series in the set altogether- Moby Dick Magoo, Robin Hood Magoo and Merlin Magoo-that makes the set worth it right there!

 It's so much Mr Magloo, it's really mind numbing. I say go for it, Charlie! Then get me a million dollar salad and a hot sauce cocktail!",1378166400,5,974,4.8969696969696965

4684405,5,B005FQ1ONG,I was a Woody Woodpecker fan when I was little. I didn't hear of Mr Magoo until I first heard of Jim Backus through his hit song Delicious. Or at least his name. Id been watching Gilligans Island for years and was quite surprised to find out he was Thurston Howell III. Theese are very funny which I know first hand because I ordered them. I also preordered the movie shorts and cant wait for June to arrive so I can get them. Jim Backus was a genious voicing him just as Mel Blanc was voicing all the Looney Tunes Chartors. All three shows are very funny and I recomend that you get them. Youll be disappointed if you dont.,1328313600,3,624,4.208333333333333

8470438,5,B005FQ1ONG,"I purchased this set because it included the Famous Adventures of Mr, Magoo, A series that digests many literature classics... My grandson and I started with William Tell.  What is really impressive is that the background details are included.  (Did you remember that this adventure happened in 1307... My grandson can tell you that, and more-  if you asked).
Mr Magoo's Famous Adventures makes for an easy and fun way to introduce the Classics.... we've enjoyed all we've seen... His favorite to date is The Three Musketeers and he can tell you that originally there were Three, but  d'Artagnan came later to make them Four.
My grandson says ' It's an example of what all Educational Kids shows should be like....Fun and exciting and not boring or FLUFF like so many kids shows today!'",1525219200,,786,4.843283582089552
