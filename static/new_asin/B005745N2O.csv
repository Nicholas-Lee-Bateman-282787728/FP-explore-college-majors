8460240,4,B005745N2O,"I think it was good and Bronson who i think played his role nice. Some good music from Ennio Morricone. I think Bronson is cool in this film. He has that stoneface or pokerface if you wish. It is not a Action film as the cover might suggest. It`s a crime film. Very little action in this. Not the best crime film i have seen, but you like Euro crime, i recommend it.

Picture quality: 4/5

I liked the image quality. Pretty clear and detailed with no signs of DNR. It looked sharp in my opinion.

Audio quality: 4/5

It has only the English/Italian Mono sound in a 2 channel LPCM track with English subtitles. The music and dialog sounds good and clear on the English track, except in a brief scene where Bronson Telly Savalas talk in a car where they sound obviously like they sit in a dubbing room with a bit tinny sound. Of course the gunshot lacks any bass, but the music have some bass.

Film: 3.5/5
