8392336,4,B0039UU3KK,"Warner Bros. Pictures/First National Pictures presents ""TIGER SHARK"" (1932) (77 min/B&W) -- Starring Edward G. Robinson, Richard Arlen, Zita Johann, Leila Bennett & J. Carrol Naish,

Directed by Howard Hawks

Here we have a story of an older man with a physical handicap falls in love with an attractive young woman who owes him a favor. She marries him, more out of a sense of obligation than for love. Then she becomes attracted to a handsome young man who works alongside her handicapped husband. The young man returns her attraction, and they start having an affair. The husband discovers his wife's infidelity, and then (in the climax of the film) he and the younger man duke it out. That's the plot of this film, and it's also the plot of two dozen other Warner's films which are uncredited remakes of ""Tiger Shark"".

Warner Brothers recycled the plot of Tiger Shark in other locales. But actually Robinson had done a version of They Knew What They Wanted back in 1930 entitled A Lady to Love. That's the real origin of this plot.

Tiger Shark was shot in the early 1930s and there are some interesting scenes of men sailing their boat into a school of tuna, guided by a lookout, then lining up in the leads and pulling the fish in using flexible poles, one at a time. The scenes are authentic and exciting. Alas, they are history.

Very notable for its exciting fishing sequences especially the rather grisly for it's time shark attacks - the scene where Robinson loses his hand to one of the marauding beasts is particularly effective. The fishing boat scenes are realistically handled and the principal players do a good job. But this story has been told better and told better by Mr. Robinson himself.

Excellent direction by Howard Hawks. Edward G, gives another outstanding performance and Richard Arlen is unfairly forgotten nowadays, Arlen gives a good performance here. Zita Johann is excellent here, hampered only by her thick accent. She retired early from films to marry the producer John Houseman, long before Houseman became an Oscar-winning actor.

Special footnote -- Zita Johann's most famous role is the female lead in ""The Mummy"" (1932) opposite Boris Karloff. When Johann published her autobiography in the 1980s, the publishers' promo material played up the fact that Johann had co-starred with Karloff, but they managed to avoid mentioning which Karloff film she'd been in - apparently the studio did not want us to think that Zita was an actress who only starred in horror films. She was a strong woman in Hollywood and once phoned up a major studio executive to ask why he made such rubbish.

Good film all around. But the highpoint is the truly remarkable footage of tuna fishing in a stormy sea.

8392337,3,B0039UU3KK,"The Warners Archive series are very expensive no frills DVDs.  The prints are unrestored and the only extras sometimes are original trailers.  If all of this sounds negative, it is but at least some rare films are now available to view.

""Tiger Shark"" is an early Howard Hawks buddy movie, typical of so much of Hawks more famous output - a triangle with a woman in the middle of 2 mates. This one is set around fishing and there are excellent documentary style inserts of the mechanics of the industry. Edward G Robinson plays a braggart Portuguese fisherman with a heart of gold but lonely. He marries unusual Zita Johann who admits she does not love him. The triangle is completed by Richard Arlen, Robinson's first mate, who falls for Johann. The acting by the principals is excellent. Robinson provides a striking contrast to his Little Caesar persona. Johann has a disturbing presence. Her unusual looks and silent underacting using her eyes makes her way ahead of her time. She should be better known.

If you like Edward G Robinson as I do, you will want to view this gem of a film. The print is variable and there are no extras.",1264204800,4,1137,4.6138613861386135
