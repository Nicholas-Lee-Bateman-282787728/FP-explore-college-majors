8599605,5,B00DZVOLOC,"Maynard Seider's ""Farewell to Factory Towns?"" is a beautifully crafted analysis of what goes wrong when deindustrialization devastates a local economy, despite the good intentions of optimistic planners.  It's a story of late capitalism played out repeatedly in contemporary America. When North Adams' major employer, Sprague Electric, is shuttered, an innovative new museum, MASS MoCA, is seen as a solution to the economic and social implosion wrought by the closing of the factory.  Although the museum is a success, North Adams continues to erode.  Seider's film shows us why good intentions often miss the mark, and why a WPA-style intervention by government is desperately needed.  This is a film that needs wide distribution.  It is riveting and deeply moving, and it is something that students in the social sciences should not miss.  Very highly recommended!",1379462400,,867,5.385185185185185
8599606,5,B00DZVOLOC,"Seider is one of a handful of scholars investigating the labor history of Berkshire County, Mass., where local historians normally build careers writing about the wealthy families who built vast ""cottages"" in the area during the Gilded Age. The important history of working people and their struggles in Western Mass. has until now not been brought to a wide audience.

As someone who taught in North Adams and who currently works in another struggling mill town in Connecticut, I'm glad this story is being told. As another reviewer put it, this documentary should be ""required viewing"" for anyone who cares about class issues in America. The film would fit perfectly in a sociology or economics class at either the high school or college level.",1376524800,,746,5.016129032258065
8599607,5,B00DZVOLOC,"""Farewell to Factory Towns?"" focuses on North Adams, MA, a community that has experienced some of the most devastating impacts of deindustrialization and is undertaking community revival through the arts.  These are processes that are increasingly important to understand, but there are few resources I know of that bring them to light as clearly and accessibly as does this film. It is appropriate for both community groups and university classes. I can't wait to show it to my urban politics students.",1374537600,,503,5.209876543209877
8599608,5,B00DZVOLOC,"As a historian of U.S. social movements and a longtime activist for social and economic justice, I have never been more deeply affected by a documentary about a community's struggle to recover from economic devastation. Maynard Seider, a progressive sociologist who has long studied the interrelationship of community and labor, has produced a passionate, poignant, and powerful portrayal of how the citizens of North Adams, Mass., built a relatively prosperous factory town over several generations until they were hit by the departure of Sprague Electric Co., which had employed half of the town. Through dogged determination and creative resilience the citizens made strides toward economic alternatives but ultimately understood that North Adams could not recover on its own. They needed help from the larger society, from government. They are still waiting. A riveting film that will lift your spirits in our troubled times.",1374451200,2,929,5.503496503496503
8599609,5,B00DZVOLOC,"In the 1980s the town of North Adams lost its biggest employer when Sprague Electric shut down, devastating the local community. Unlike the years of the Great Depression when the federal government supported failing economies and displaced workers, this factory closure was well into the era of government cutbacks (which began in the 70s) adding to the hardship of displaced workers.  This film looks at how key players in North Adams tried to get the economy going again, mostly through development of an art museum and the tourist industry. But is this enough?  In dozens of interviews with local politicians, developers,  entrepreneurs, students, artists, scholars, Farewell to Factory Towns plunges deep into this question. The collage of interviews, archival footage, and analysis is fascinating, compelling, riveting. If you want to understand what is happening to our economy, see this film. The story of this one town sheds light on what is happening across America.",1374364800,,975,5.318181818181818
8599610,5,B00DZVOLOC,"This film is riveting from beginning to end.  While focusing on the devastation visited upon a small factory town in northern Massachusetts, its message extends to thousands of such towns throughout the United States.  Powerful without being preachy, it allows the viewer to understand the history behind the globalized deindustrialization of the U.S. and the ongoing elite assault on working people through globalization and neoliberal economics.  Anyone interested in the continuing and expanding class divide in the U.S. should watch this film. Those not interested should be required to watch it and see how the heart of this country is being torn out.  Just a great documentary.",1374192000,,683,5.355140186915888
8599611,5,B00DZVOLOC,"The film is the story of mill towns everywhere that have fallen victim to deindustrialization.  But rather than leaving the audience wringing their hands at the intractable issues, the filmmaker ends with a provocative
framework for viewing the issues and exploring innovative public solutions.  I've shown this film at a public event in the small Connecticut factory town where I live. It provoked a wide ranging discussion afterwards that was written up in the local newspaper.  This film would work very well in classrooms too.",1374105600,,530,5.211764705882353
8599612,5,B00DZVOLOC,"Starting with one town and broadening out to what's wrong with the entire political economy, this excellent documentary brings alive the human implications of policy decisions by elected officials and corporations, and inspires viewers to action for real, bottom-up economic development.

Everyone should see Farewell to Factory Towns!
