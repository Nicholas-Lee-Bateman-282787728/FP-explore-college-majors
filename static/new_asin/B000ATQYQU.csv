2393806,4,B000ATQYQU,"In the summer of '81, Kansas 8-year-olds Neil and Brian are both sexually abused by their Little League coach, but their reactions could not be more different. For the sexually precocious Neil, it's a sexual awakening, setting him on the path to becoming a gay hustler and a life of such emotional numbness that he looks back on Coach as his ""one true love"".  For Brian, it's a hellish experience his brain all but erases with 5 hours of lost time, leaving him shy, remote, unable to engage romantically with anyone, and floundering through adolescence struggling to make sense of what happened to him.  It's only when he finally reconnects with Neil after a decade of searching that all the pieces finally fall into place... Gregg Araki's significant achievement here is to make a movie that is as moving as it is pitiless in the depiction of abuse and its consequences.  The writing is crisp, the performances brave and convincing (Joseph Gordon-Levitt especially), and it's so brilliantly structured and edited that the only time any abuse is actually ""seen"" is in the minds of the audience during the moving final confessional sequence.  It's hard to believe that this bold and tender film could be criticised for its masterful handling of a difficult subject, yet it aroused the ire of ludicrously conservative film and literature classification bodies here in Australia.  Members were apparently alarmed that it might be used as some kind of training video for paedophiles in how to ""groom"" their victims.  On the contrary: rarely has a film so powerfully and effectively argued against abuse by showing its devastating consequences.",1125273600,54,1639,5.029520295202952
2393807,5,B000ATQYQU,"This was one of the best films of 2005. All of the actors are outstanding, but Joseph Gordon Levitt really carries the film in a breakout performance both haunting, sexy and tender in his realism.

This is independent American film at its best- very absorbing, it lingers in your mind for days even months afterwards.",1124668800,15,317,4.763636363636364
2393808,5,B000ATQYQU,"Watched Mysterious Skin two days ago. Somehow I didn't have the compulsion to write anything about it, like I usually would when I have watched a (good or bad) film. It was because I was reeling from the disturbing effects the film had on me even after two days.

""The summer I was eight years old, five hours disappeared from my life""? so runs the catchy opening to the adapted film. The boy grows up believeing that he was abducted by strange aliens the five hours he was lost. The other grows up to be a gay hustler until he has a tragic and violent encounter. The material wasn't groundbreaking; it talks about paedophilic gay child abuse and the effects it had on the two boys involved in it long after it was over. However, it was the realism portrayed by the leads Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock From The Sun) and Brady Corbet that really shook me inside. It also revealed the stereotypical American gay society in the 80's and early 90's. The two little known actors and the supporting cast of Jeff Licon and Michelle Trachtenberg who play Levitt's best friends also lent great depth to the movie.

I really loved the scene where the snow fell and God was heard. Watch it for yourself, but it's not for the faint-hearted. (A)",1124582400,22,1235,4.533632286995516
2393809,5,B000ATQYQU,"This is a tough, intense movie about the results of child abuse.  Two boys, age 8, are abused by their Little League coach.  One of the boys is traumatized, he can remember nothing about the incident.  Five hours has disappeared from his life and as he grows older he believes he may have been kidnapped by aliens.  Sounds comical--it isn't and it works.  The other boy, probably destined to be gay in any event, loves his memories of his coach and what the coach did to him.  The first boy grows up to be sexually neutered, on a quest to find out what happened during those missing five hours.  The other boy grows up to be a teenage hustler ""with a black hole where his heart should be.""  The acting throughout is superb, both Brady Corbett (Brian) and Joseph Gordon-Leavitt deserve five gold stars each.  You cannot take your eyes off Gordon-Leavitt when he is on screen.  The directing is remarkable; totally unlike anything Gregg Araki has done in the past.  You have to be ""up"" for this film; if you're out for two hours of simple minded entertainment, forget it.  On the other hand, if you think that perhaps movies should be ""about"" something, this one is definitely for you.  It had a limited release in art theaters.  I sincerely hope it gets a much wider acceptance on DVD.  It deserves it.",1124409600,5,1301,4.523605150214593

2393886,5,B000ATQYQU,"Sensitive, profound portrayal with great acting and an intelligent treatment of people's belief in alien abductions, without being condescending. It suggests psychological responses that are worth exploring. The characters are compelling and the situations believable.

2393887,1,B000ATQYQU,I purchased this without really looking at the subject matter.  It is a completely disturbed movie and belongs in its own category of disgusting films.,1461974400,,151,5.04
2393888,5,B000ATQYQU,"This is a great movie about two boys who suffer from when they were abducted to a man and end up being prodtitute even they went back home safe.
One of them are played by now a well know actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the other by Brady Corbet.
While Joseph is understanding what has happened back then pretty well, Brady was kind of all blanked out during that period when he was 9. He has the bloody nose and thinks that he was kidnapped by alien and was experimented by them But he does remembered that he was with Joseph and he is desperately looking for him to find the real answer to what really happened back then since his life is not so smooth even when he is now.
He sometimes faints, bleeds from his nose. Life ain't easy for him.
Brady on the other hand became a prostitute and sometimes he got bitten by older guys but he seems to manage pretty well.
He got a girlfriend that is the only one who understands him. (Not a girlfriend girlfriend byt just a friend).

This movie is showing how it effect boy's life when they were kidnapped and experience sex from another man later how they suffer in life.
They either become a hooker or outsider in this world.
For the man who did this to the boys simply do this for their one minute of pleasure and forget it for good.
What a pitty.

We should have a better law something like cut off their thing or something when we find them out.
Not just put the electric ring thing in their feet to watch them.

The ending was a really memorable when finally Brady Corbet finds out that it was not an alien who did this to him but the man who did. With the music of the Sigur Ros following, it was more then sad. It was like sulimation of anger and pain.

I first saw Joseph Gordon-Levitt from the movie <The Lookout> or <Brick> he was a guy whom I cannot deny. Then I saw him again in a bigger budget movie  <(500) Days of Summer>. Now he is a star being in movies like  <Inception> <50/50> <Looper> <Dark knight Returns> <The Walk>.
From the beginning I think most of all knew that he will make it.",1461715200,,2048,4.211734693877551

2393931,1,B000ATQYQU,I saw this film on Hulu. The description did not give any details on how perverse this film actually is. If the graphic scenes were left out I would have given it a better rating. They were not necessary. Child molesters would probably enjoy this film because of the explicit molestation scenes and the manner that the director or writer made it appear that the 8 year old victim named Neil was attracted to his perpetrator. Perverts would also likely enjoy the idea that their sick acts can ruin a persons life. These types of films are not necessary and all child molesters should be executed. One good thing about this film is that it may give people the insight that this sort of thing really happens in this world.,1445212800,,719,4.538461538461538
2393952,5,B000ATQYQU,"This is a little known movie made early in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's career. He certainly isn't playing the kind of character he did in Third Rock From The Sun on TV.  This is a brutal film dealing with the aftermath of some kid's encounters with an overly affectionate Little League coach. One kid ends up in the sex trade. Another harbors the idea that during the period's he was being molested he was actually being kidnapped and probed by aliens from outer space. One boy knows the truth and eventually exposes it to the ""abductee"".
This is some heavy stuff, and JGL does a great job with it. I imagine he much more enjoys his roles in the Dark Night movie, and Inception and the time travel movie he co-starred with Bruce Willis in. This is role that demonstrates he is was always a serious actor not afraid to take risks.",1443225600,3,824,4.493333333333333
2393953,4,B000ATQYQU,"This is an interesting film about two boys that were abused by their coach as children and how they coped with it over the next ten years and finally came to grips with each other after meeting up again after all that time.

2393954,5,B000ATQYQU,This film is a work of art in so many ways.,1440633600,,43,3.0
2393955,5,B000ATQYQU,"Disclaimer: This film is not for the faint of heart, or anyone who may be easily be offended by excessive adult themes. This film takes a very in-depth and unabashed look at pedophilia, sexual relations between children, prostitution, and more.

However, I still believe that this is one of the best films I have ever seen to this day.

At the heart of this movie is a tragic loss of childhood innocence, and the consequences that it can have on a person as he or she develops. And in this case, those consequences are devastating and heartbreaking. It also takes a look at how two people can react to the same event, and cope with it in radically different ways. This film will leave you with an intense sense of remorse and possibly deep disgust; leaving you questioning how some people could possibly do the things they do and still carry on from day to day.

Most importantly, this film is honest. Its portrayals of life in a small town and the effects of horrible events on people are deep and complex, thoroughly thought out. It does not whitewash the awfulness of pedophilia, or try to romanticize the ignorance and intolerance that can be pervasive in small towns. And by the end of the movie, you will want nothing more than to be able to reach through the screen and comfort the two broken little boys that the film is based upon.

""I wished with all my heart that we could just leave this world behind. Rise like two angels in the night and magically disappear.""",1440028800,11,1473,4.526315789473684

Up until this point he had kind of been  type-casted as an actor, but Mysterious Skin is certainly not 10 Things I Hate About You. Gregg Araki movies are not for everyone; they are raw, gritty, and 80% of the time have homosexual characters. He is definitely not your average director. I watched this with my parents the first time which was awkward to say the least, but I bought it soon after. Great story, great characters, great plot twist, not so great to watch with your parents.",1431302400,3,585,4.625
2393974,5,B000ATQYQU,"Was not surprised to learn Greg Araki directed this, since it was so good. I consider it one of his best performances,. the ""kid"" from the tv show 3rd Planet From the Sun steps out of his old typecast role as a teenager in a stunning performance that shocks you with plot twists and some grit of real-world-living & the (wide) breadth of his ability to perform. we can only hope this actor is as good as this in real life. Defiitely too graphic in at least one scene (or 2) for any others than adults. You would be hard pressed not to cry in the one scene where he is assulted & beat up & then afterword. A movie you will never forget, but also a bit disturbing, like all of Araki's-directed movies, * almost as good as Araki's unrelated predecessor, Nowhere (1987). I told a friend & they had to own a copy too. Most assuredly you want to get this unrated director's version. One of the scenes, the actor is playing announcer at a little league game while getting blown under the counter in the private room overlooking the diamond, then you realize he needs the money to care for his younger sibling and is forced to parent-- people often have to do all kinds of things for money. You will be entranced and drawn into the plot  the entire movie. It also reminds you a little of the British film Fishbowl, about the adolescent girl growing up too fast that does mean things to others but only because she feel she has too, this all-time favorite actor of mine in Mysterious Skin, Joseph-Gordon Levitt will shock you with his acting ability, to fully absorb and be enveloped by his role.

The initial dvd arrived promptly, but there was a little rattling noise coming from inside the dvd package, before I even opened it.  Upon opening the dvd package, I noticed that a little broken, plastic piece was lodged beneath the eve inside.
When I took the disc out, I could see that it was heavily scratched, & I knew it was going to cause problems. However, I put the disc into my dvd player,& tried to play the video.  IT SHOWED:""NO DISC"" & tried again, but no go!  Obviously, these scratches ruined the dvd & its ability to play!  HOWEVER, the awesome people @ REFINED DESIGNS, of VENICE, CA, got on the go & actually sent me a new, shiny disc of ""Mysterious Skin,"" & it looks like new!!  I am so satisfied with these people & how they handled this regrettable situation, that I am writing this to tell every potential customer that this is one place that backs its product up-& when something goes wrong, they are there for their customers!

2394043,5,B000ATQYQU,"Elephant in the room - there's no getting around the fact that child abuse is sort of front and center in this particular story. Neil is sexually abused at the age of 8 and those scenes may be a little uncomfortable to watch for anyone. It's interesting to note that the movie was filmed in a clever manner that isolated the child actors and kept them in the dark about the abuse aspect of their character roles. And this aspect to things is hardly a tasteless depiction of the whole thing. If anything, the whole movie acts as sort of a demonstration (or perhaps an analysis?) of the effects of child abuse long into adulthood. Neil's character has a particularly shady life all because of that first instance of exploitation.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is pretty brilliant in this movie and he's a character that you feel for even if you don't necessarily approve of his life choices. In the larger scheme of things, it's clear to us as viewers why his life has turned out the way it did starting with the abuse and including his somewhat distant mother. But this movie wouldn't have been the same had Levitt not been involved to share his unique brand of emotional intensity to the production.

When you look at the whole production, Araki's often quirky style seemed a bit muted here, but in a good way. When he's given source material to adhere too, his style actually turns into something that is amazingly complex and rather involving. This is not to say his other movies aren't complex - if anything they tend to go a little overboard right into complicated and confusing. So this was definitely one of his better movies, at least in my opinion.

The rest of the cast was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. That may be because of the way they were written or perhaps everyone just paled in comparison to Levitt. To be fair, they may not have had the chance to really shine given how much screen time the character of Neil gets throughout the movie. There's no doubt who the primary protagonist is despite the counter point of Brian's story. If anything, I think that side of things could have been developed a wee bit more.

This is a rather short review, but there's not much else to say beyond this: it's an intelligent, well-performed movie that has a strong message to deliver. And it's totally worth seeing.",1403740800,,2318,4.618932038834951

2394045,5,B000ATQYQU,This movie should be seen by everyone with children and older teens as well. It will stay with you long after it is over.

2394046,5,B000ATQYQU,"Anyone that ever wants to make a low-budget gay indie flick will have to try and topple the king of the mountain. Say what you will about Araki's other films (weird, surreal, snarky, cool) but he nails this film in a way few will ever come close to doing.  It's probably going to be his masterpiece for his career.

This is the film that really transformed Joseph Gordon-Levitt into an adult actor, paving the way for all those Christopher Nolan films or 500 Days Of Summer.  He attacks the role of Neil without hesitation, giving him a sexuality that is dangerous and alluring. In all the ways that other sexualized teen movies get it wrong, this does not, to the point of discomfort. On the flip side, Brady Corbet as innocent Brian is so traumatized by his own sexual awakening, he can barely function.  Watching their two journeys collide by the end of the movie is hard to watch but strangely beautiful.

Anyone who wants to make a better film in terms of acting, period looks, scoring is going to have to pull off a miracle because this is a perfect film.  I doubt I'll see a better gay-themed film ever.",1401926400,,1110,4.497512437810945

I think that everyone should see this movie because it shows how pedophiles manipulate and spin a web of false love and caring for their victims, leaving the victims confused, traumatized and scared for life.
Mysterious skin allows the audience to get a glimpse of how all victims deal with sexual abuse differently and how parents need to be aware of personality and behavior changes.

After watching this film I hope no parent will ever allow a child to be alone with an adult. Most pedophiles are not strangers to their victims (i.e family, friends of the family or educators).

Having been a victim like the character, it was very difficult to watch but compelling at the same time.  I enjoyed the two different characters (Brian and Neil) and how each carried the burden of the pedophile who molested them.  It was very hard to watch in parts, very touching in others and in the end, a good cry as Neil is holding Brian and filling him in on the past he blocked out.  Mr.  Gordon-Levitt delivered a truly great believable character and if this hadn't been such a ""taboo"" subject in the main stream of cinema, it deserved to be a ""nominated"" performance.

I tend to agree with the rest of the reviews - well done without being exploitive. I found the story able to come to a close, with the explanations that you need, all the while keeping you as a passive observer able to say ""of course - I knew it, sort of.""  Great acting.  One of J.G.L's best.  Well written and scripted.  Left me hoping that the character's lives can get better after the credits roll.

2394120,5,B000ATQYQU,"If you have been sexually abused and/or raped, be careful about viewing this film- lots of potent trigger material for flashbacks, overwhelming emotions etc. It definitely got to me emotionally. If you are not sure, split viewing it into two or three parts.
This movie is probably about someone close to you.  Chances are high that one or more in your inner circle- your closest friends including work or school, your significant other, parents, grandparents, siblings and other close family members- was sexually abused. Of those 10-20 people, the females are more likely but, as this movie portrays, the male numbers are not far behind.
This is a powerful, disturbingly authentic portrayal. ""Grooming"" shown by the abuser was typical. The use of one boy in the abuse of the younger is also quite accurate. Note that one boy came from a highly supervised family, but was still abused. It is impossible to totally protect a child. Also, one boy was gay, the other abused boy wasn't. Abused males are only slightly more likely to be gay, and many hetero males survivors remain uncomfortable around other men.
If I have it complaint, it is the ""alien"" story line. I understand why the scriptwriter used that device, but it gives a skewed impression.  It is a dramatic way to portray the misunderstandings children come up with when abuse way beyond what they can understand, feelings so powerful they distort reality and the mind's most potent defense mechanisms intersect.
In the final poignant scene, we see the beginning of healing as the boys face what really happened and begin to communicate. My road to healing began with honesty also, and no matter how long and difficult the road may be, only one thing matters: There is HOPE!",1385942400,,1733,4.891156462585034

2394132,4,B000ATQYQU,"Although it is sometimes listed under gay and lesbian interest, or even under erotica, MYSTERIOUS SKIN is in fact a dark, often painful movie leavened with rare flashes of perverse humor and sexiness that only serve to make the rest of the film seem even darker.

Two eight year old boys are in the same little league baseball team.  One, Neil, is already beginning to identify himself as gay; the other, Brian, is a complete innocent with few, if any, ideas about sexuality.  Both children are molested by their coach, and the molestation touches off very different reactions.

As a teenager, Neil becomes a prostitute, constantly trying recreate the relationship and he had with the coach; Brian, however, blocks the memory entirely, and gradually becomes obsessed with the idea that the lost time arose from a UFO abduction.  Eventually Brian recalls Neil, andbelieving that Neil too was a victim of UFO abductionsearches him out, hoping that Neil can remember what he does not.  And Neil has not forgotten a thing.

The movie runs on parallel tracks, detailing Neil and Brians lives in separate fashion until the two again meet more than a decade after their molestation.  Although Brian does not remember the molestation, there is never any question about what actually occurred, so the film is not so much a what happened as it is a what it did to us.  Brians fixation on UFOs is actually thematic: he is convinced that he was abducted and examined by an alien, and in a sense he was, although the alien in question was not from outer space but a small town kids baseball coach who probably did more damage to the children than any self-respecting outer space alien would.

Although the story is interesting and the script well-written, the film lives on its performances.  The child actors, especially Chase Ellison as the young Neil, are astonishing, and their accomplishment is all the more impressive when the director states, on the audio commentary track, that the children were kept oblivious to the nature of the story, with most of the molestation scenes created in the cutting room.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet are flawless as the teenage Neil and Brian, and Bill Sage is remarkably powerful in the small role of Coach, who appears only briefly in the film but seems to dominate it.

MYSTERIOUS SKIN is not going to please everyone.  It is as sexually explicit as it can be without going into X territory; the seduction and molestation of the children is painful; and a fairly graphic rape scene equally so.  And at the end of the story there is no escape from the past, only darkness faced with more honesty than there was before.  The film includes several extras, including deleted scenes and an audio commentary.  Recommended, but strange and painful.

2394133,5,B000ATQYQU,"How on earth did this film end up in the gay and lesbian section?

This is about Child Abuse and not Homosexuality, unless you want to call paedophillia or male rape, and the abuse of rent boys, homosexuality?

Companies like Amazon have no idea of how this movie plays, it is a straight drama, where one of the main characters happens to be gay, not made gay but gay.

It needs to be put in with mainstream films where straight people as well as gay people will find it and hopefully the World might start to understand how sexual abuse destroys.

The film itself was beautiful, brilliant and achingly moving.  Some of the scenes can trigger and Amazon should be making a warning about that but trigger or not any boy or man who has been abused should be watching this film then telling their own secrets to the World.",1384560000,,819,4.433333333333334

2394135,4,B000ATQYQU,"First, I have to compliment the reviews written by the Amazon viewers I. Sondel, Jennifer Heath, and Steven Reynolds. I couldn't agree more with their comments...well done people! Big kudos to the director. This is one movie, to echo the reviewers, that could have been mangled from a lot of different directions. Instead, the movie provides a compelling treatment of a subject with insight and yet with enough objectivity so that the audience can sympathize with a character who dives headfirst into risky behaviors that become progressively worse. A big surprise for me was the superb acting of Miss Trachtenberg. I've only seen her in one other move, 'Ice Princess,' which was filmed the year after 'Mysterious Skin.' From foul mouth, tough, small town girl surviving in the big city to incredibly intelligent and graceful skater...Holy Toledo, what a range of acting chops she has!",1382659200,,885,5.110344827586207

Turns out she has an important role throughout the movie, but we don't see a lot of her. What this movie is really about is Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) being seduced at around age 8 by his baseball coach, then growing up as a male prostitute in New York. He encounters fellow ball player Brian (Brady Corbet) ten years after the experience, to learn that Brian is suffering from psychogenic amnesia and night terrors.

2394179,5,B000ATQYQU,"Unfortunately there is no shortage of movies about child molestation since the crime is so common in our society. However,  this one was different because I truly FELT what the characters felt. It was as if I were experiencing it firsthand rather than viewing it from a safe distance. Yes, it was hard to watch. The subject matter of the movie was very intense and so the portrayals needed to be intense. The director did an excellent job of creating a brutally honest movie about child molestation and the after effects of it. The entire movie had been building up to a revelation that was expected but gripping and raw when it was finally revealed.
As for the graphic scenes and dialogue, I didn't feel that any of it was gratuitous but that it contributed to the realness of the movie. Without them, the viewer would not have seen how jaded, matter of fact, and even nonchalant one character was about the molestation's impact on his life. There would have been no mirror of the two boys' past and present experiences either. But I can't explain that without having a spoiler.
This would be a wonderful movie for discussion. I can only imagine what a great read the book is.",1372464000,3,1177,4.604761904761904

As an abuse survivor, I found there were a lot of triggers that had me shaking, but it reached me on a level that I've often had trouble explaining to others.

2394200,5,B000ATQYQU,I really liked this movie. It starts out without revealing its ultimate secret. There is one gruesome scene (but no killing). Others  just sent shivers up my spine through excellent use of camera shots. It follows the two main characters with the viewer unsure at first how their lives intersect. This movie brings out a number of emotions in the viewer. It is certainly for mature viewers and I enjoyed it very much. Highly recommended.,1362182400,,437,4.826666666666667

2394213,4,B000ATQYQU,"Mysterious Skin is the story of two boys and an event one summer, that changed their lives forever. Both had different reactions to it and both had their whole lives consumed by it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Neil, and does an outstanding job. Neil is a male prostitute, cold and heartless on the outside, but lonely and miserable on the inside. JGL does a great job of portraying both to the audience. Be warned thou, this is one graphic film, not for the faint of heart. There are a lot of raw scenes featuring Neil, in fact, I don't think I've ever seen someone get undressed as many times in one movie as JGL does in this one. As for the film, it starts out strong, then in the middle, it seems like your typical, weird, indie flick. Don't turn it off just yet, because it gets better and better, building up to one of the strongest endings I've seen in a long time. This isn't something that hasn't been done before, but a combination of a great cast, top notch acting, and a brutally graphic depiction of events, makes it unique and something that you're going to want to see.",1361577600,,1082,4.415

2394218,5,B000ATQYQU,"This movie should definitely be on the list of top gay related films. It is a very important film that speaks to a boy's life experience with the 'dark side'. This stuff happens far often to too many kids growing up and they/we have to live through it and hide it because we're just kids and don't know what else to do. Watching this film brings back troubling memories but more importantly it may be the first time we see our/this story being told in an 'in your face' way. No one wants to hear it first hand, from the victims. No one wants to believe its happening right in front of their faces. No one stops and asks the right questions in a loving and safe way. It's like no one really seems to care - ignorance is bliss.

It is very important that when victims grow up and see their story having been written and made public that we can say to our selves: ""I thought I was the only one this was happening to. I thought I was just a bad/weak kid. I thought I brought all this upon myself. Now I know it was not all my fault. Now I understand a whole lot better what made me this way.""

It is the very people who have given this film low reviews due to it being too graphic and raw who should take notice. Maybe then they will better understand where a lot of these 'bad-boy'survival behaviors come from. When boys and girls don't feel emotionally protected and don't know who, if anyone, truly loves them - then they have to try and figure those two things out for themselves. If they ever find out the answers you can bet they found out the long and hard way. 'Mysterious Skin' is trying to open your eyes, not shut them. I guarantee you that someone you know well is livin' in that skin. What are you gonna do? [Watch the film again!]",1359763200,,1740,4.191044776119403

Both Joseph Gordon Levitt and Brady Corbet did an amazing job of taking on and portraying these roles and I hope that the actors and Gregg Araki know what an impact this movie had for certain audience members, including myself, who have dealt with our own traumas in the past.

But in the end, after be sexually abused by their baseball coach, both were physically and emotionally hurt that their lives would always be filled with pain. This movie showed a realistic view of what sexual abuse of young children does to them as they try to mature. Brady seemed to be almost stuck in a fantasy which helped him to block out what happened, and Joseph decended into being a gay male prostitute - which I believe he did because he was punishing himself.

I rooted for the young male prostitute. He was not ashamed of being gay and making some money on that fact. He was resilient and a fighter. But a big heart as well.

Mysterious Skin is intense, brutal, and will deepen your understanding of the emotional and mental aftereffect of enduring an experience or several episodes of sexual abuse and how it can influence later behavior.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is excellent as the victim with the only ability to cope is to be emotionally stunted while leading a promiscuous lifestyle. Brady Corbet is spot on as the asexual and delusional victim who is socially awkward. I appreciate the fact that the sexual abuse was shown or explicitly discussed and was not sugarcoated. Some scenes are heart-wrenching and uncomfortable to watch but this is one of the most realistic portrayals of sexual abuse survivors I've ever seen.",1319760000,2,783,5.314516129032258

2394269,5,B000ATQYQU,"It all starts and ends with a little league's pedophile coach and two kids: Neil and Brian, who unbeknownst to their parents are the victims of a sexual predator. But what is the authentic aftermath of this encounter between the man and the 8-year-old children? The repercussions of sexual abuse will affect greatly the lives of Neil and Brian, but in so many different ways that one could almost wonder if they shared the same experience. As a matter of fact, being sexually abused is such a traumatic event for Brian that he blocks it out of his mind unable to cope with the real, and he then proceeds to fill in the memory gaps with a fantasy of alien abduction. Recurring to such self-defense mechanisms is quite a normal psychological strategy, but it also mingles well with a recurring theme in Araki's cinematography.

Neil, on the other hand, fills in the gashing void with an idealized image of the pedophile. After all, during an entire summer the two of them spend many nights together. Neil actually functions as an accomplice, helping the coach to lure in unsuspecting boys, thus creating a perverse bond between them. Perhaps one of the greatest accomplishes of Scott Heim's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mysterious-Skin/dp/B00166YCD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mysterious Skin</a>&nbsp;is to invert the roles, creating a pedophile that seems to be nicer and more caring than the boys' parents, while at the same time embedding at least one of the victims with an attitude that one would find difficult to sympathize with. Araki's film, of course, thrives because of that: the complexity between the characters relationships. This is not, after all, a lesson of morality. Here the coach leaves the town, with an untarnished reputation, and leaves behind Neil, a very obsessed boy who admits later that ""it's a huge part of me. No one ever made me feel that way before or since [...] I was his one true love"".

Perversion seems to be the one predominant constant throughout Neil's life, but as Lacan would define it, a perverse individual is the one who assumes the position of the object-instrument of the ""will-to-enjoy"" (volont&eacute;-de-jouissance), which is not his own will but that of the big Other. In this case, Neil accepts to serve as a garish tool of pleasure for the coach, and years later, as a teenage hustler, he has no quandaries when it is his turn to be the instrument of joy of the other (namely his clients). Emotionally detached from everyone, only a girl, a friend from childhood, remains as his one and true humane anchor. His mother, after all, has always been a carefree woman, constantly hooking up with men, and paying no attention to his son; that's why when Neil is about to depart to New York, she looks at him and utters ""my baby, all grown up"", not as a typical motherly affirmation but rather a discovery: time flew by, and she wasn't there at all.

Brian's dreams are a reminder that another boy was with him the night of the alien abduction, consequently the insecure boy starts the search for Neil, and learns of his whereabouts just after Neil has left for the big city. It is then that Neil's friend, Eric, a very flamboyant gay kid, befriends him. Brian is quite a timid and introversive teenager, perhaps as a result of having a very dominant mother and an absent father (even before he abandons the family, he was only there to state how disappointed he was at his son). Eric describes him as ""weirdly asexual"" (even without knowing how Brian had violently rejected a UFO obsessed woman that intended to caress his penis); indeed, Brian is unable to reclaim sexuality for himself, and after having always lived in a world of his own he finds in Eric's friendship everything he needs to break out of his shelf.

As a male prostitute, Neil finds the horror of the real in New York, and he will soon realize how dangerous his line of business can get. Back in town, Eric is preparing himself to let go of the one reality that has sustained and nurtured his psyche, but can he embrace the real if Neil tells him exactly what happened that fatidic night? Araki brilliantly depicts this honest, heart-wrenching and unruly story, taking advantage of the exceptional acting qualities of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Neil), a daring and talented actor that has worked in many interesting independent films, such as Brick, The Lookout or Latter Days (a gay themed movie). This actor finds in Brady Corbet (Brian) the ideal partner; Corbet creates a subtle but fascinating character, completely different from his roles in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-Games/dp/B00187FPC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny Games</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thirteen/dp/B00013RC2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thirteen</a>, proving not only that he is a great actor but that he also knows how to choose the best directors to work with.",1317686400,8,5014,5.201732673267327

It takes on the harsh subjects of prostitution and pedophilia with no fear or glamor, and it shows two different reactions to child molestation versus just the one people expect those molested to feel (disgust). I loved Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character because he showed that sometimes victims do become enamored with the person causing them harm, and sometimes they don't always get that what they're doing is wrong. And his character also hit home for me because I have a friend who went through something similar as a child, and she came to react in a similarly promiscuous way as she got older. There is something so unnervingly real about this movie that I honestly can't decide how I feel about it, but I would definitely recommend watching this film to anyone interested.",1311984000,,840,4.840277777777778
2394283,4,B000ATQYQU,"Most other reviews have covered the plot - two boys seriously affected by separate events in their childhood, one becoming a hustler and the other convinced against all reason that he was abducted by aliens. It's no secret the key to both is child sex abuse but the film - with more sensitivity than I expected, especially once I realised the director was Gregg Araki whose The Living End was not so subtle however watchable it was - explores the what, when, and how, and how has it caused them to behave the way they do.

Abuse can lead a young person to treat their body cheaply and almost as separate from their own self; in a sense both boys are doing this. One (Neil, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) was the abuser's 'favourite', not knowing there had been others before and would be others afterwards. He feels pleasure but guilt. The other (Brian, played by Brady Corbet) was not so picked; without spoiling the film, it can be said his abuse was opportunistic. It so appalled him he escapes from his body.

It would have been easy to focus on Neil, the boy turned hustler, but that is not an unknown route, and though the moves Neil makes are graphically portrayed and progressive along the route to riskier and riskier pick-ups, it would have been a relatively dull film if that was all the film offered.

Brian's nose-bleeds, blackouts and alien-abduction obsession, clearly after the event attributable to the sex abuse (and I'm really surprised that no medic had the wit to ask searching questions to get to the root), are more intriguing. One when he is out with a girl friend (also alien-obsessed, and one wonders whether she too had been abused at some earlier stage) offers a hint of what so traumatised him. Eventually Brian finds that Neal was also a Little Leaguer and together they explore just what happened, and what that was is revealed graphically so that the horror is only too clear. Possibly they will find peace when this is done - the ending is slightly enigmatic.

The boys as 8- and 10-year-olds are brilliantly acted, with the viewer reading into their often blank faces the emotions which the characters they play must be feeling. Gordon-Levitt is very good in his portrayal of a soul-deadened youth; unaware of his own good looks. Corbet plays Brian as a kind of young John Denver; we don't learn much of his character so much has the obsession swamped him, but can admire the doggedness. it's been suggested by other reviewers that the adults are mostly stereotypes. In a sense this is fair - the abuser is not a creepy man in a dirty raincoat but a 'wholesome all-American jock'; that's just the point - he's the kind of guy a parent might trust (though I wouldn't). The unconcerned father and babbling mother fit the mould of the insensitivity of adults to vibes their children pass. An interesting and somewhat undeveloped role is that of Neal's heavily-made-up and gay friend, whose teenage image appears on the cover (of the version of the DVD which I bought) sharing a car with Neal and Neal's then girl friend.

My version of this DVD came in a different wrapper to that portrayed by Amazon, so I'm not sure if I have bought the 'Deluxe Unrated Diretor's Edition' or what. The extras included a dire reading from the original book, which only goes to show that actors cannot always read books aloud well. Given the material, I rate this a 4+, and recommend it. It is NOT for viewing by children under 14 and even those under 18 might benefit from having a cool gay guy on hand to explain certain things.",1307318400,,3545,4.629570747217806
2394284,5,B000ATQYQU,"I had wanted to see this film for some time, but kept putting it off. It stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Neil McCormick who is seduced by his Little league baseball coach when he is eight years old. He develops into the small mid town (Hutchinson) gay whore. He is clearly marked by the whole affair but felt as though he was truly loved.

The story rides along side that of Bryan Lackey who has suffered blackouts and nose bleeds since he was eight. He feels that he may have been abducted by aliens and sets off on a path of discovery that leads to Neil. Meanwhile Neil has run off to be with his fag hag soul mate in New York.

This all sounds like a basic plot but the story unfolds in such a way to make the 140 minutes drift by. With an 18 cert this is a challenging film, with scenes depicting paedophile activity as well as gay sex on occasion through out the film. It is a story of how children can be changed and ruined by abuse and how different people chose to handle severe trauma of this nature. It is also a very human tale which is told with great care and even warmth. It is even funny in places. This is not a typical gay film, and if you are looking for cute boys etc, then you are probably best to avoid.

2394290,5,B000ATQYQU,"Some reviewers have said that, although favorable to this film, they would not watch it more than once. I have watched it a few times now and have gotten more from it and acquired a greater appreciation for it each time. It is certainly the finest film that TLA has released up to now. Whether or not it is classified as an ""Indi"" film, I don't know, but I find it a thoroughly professional film for several reasons. The screenplay and direction are of a level not often typical of films of this kind. The superb music score by Harold Budd and Robin Guthrie is haunting and unforgettable. And if that's not enough, there's one more: Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

Gordon-Levitt, 24 at the time, brings a believable and three-dimensional quality to the chraracter of Neil McCormick that is overwhelmingly genuine and mesmerizing. The rest of the cast does excellent work here, but this is really Gordon-Levitt's picture. Of the three or four films in which I've seen him, this, in my mind, is his finest.  In the most violently harrowing scene of the film, Gordon-Levitt playing a young male prostitute, encounters more than he can handle and for the first time in the film is not in control of his situation as he always has been.  He realizes that the man who has taken him home clearly intends to violently rape him.  He tries to get away by locking himself in the bathroom by means of a hook on the door.  The man slips a knife through the crack in the door and flips up the hook.  The look on Gordon-Levittt's face, and particularly in his eyes, is exactly that of a trapped animal.  How he managed to convey this expression, I couldn't say, but it will give you nightmares or bring you to tears.  He and Brady Corbet create two characters who finally meet in the final 15 minutes of the film which becomes terribly heart rending; but this is a film well worth watching because it is an important and unforgettable film dealing with the subject of child molestation that is an issue of increasing public awareness in these times.

The closing voice-over lines given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Neil) to Brady Corbet (Brian) after explaining what was done to them when they were children that is the most touching moment in the film.  Brian has collapsed, weeping, in Neil arms;

  I wanted to tell Brian it was over now and everything would be okay.
  But that was a lie, plus, I couldn't speak anyway.
  I wish there was some way for us to go back and undo the past.
  But there wasn't.
  There was nothing we could do.
  So I just stayed silent and trying to telepathically communicate...
  how sorry I was about what had happened.
  And I thought of all the grief and sadness...
  and f----d up suffering in the world...
  and it made me want to escape.
  I wished with all my heart that we could just...
  Ieave this world behind.
  Rise like two angels in the night and magically...
  disappear.

ps: I more recently discovered that there is an excellent commentary track on this disc with director Gregg Araki, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet. It made me even more aware of the dedication and depth of feeling they and entire cast and company had for this remarkable film. The director explicitly points out that the two young actors who play the two boys at the ages of 7 and 8 were always protected from knowing what the subject matter of the film actually was.  A specially prepared script was created for them, while their parents saw the complete script and only after being assured that their sons would always be protected from knowing the full subject matter of the film gave their approval.  In most of the scenes involving the young boys, they were not playing to other actors, but to the camera with some innocent props while the highly sophisticated editing of the film led audiences to believe they were seeing things that they actually were not.  Only after realizing these details does the intelligence and artfulness that went into this film become apparent.

More recently I purchased the Blu-ray disc of this film and the improvement in video and audio are striking and well worth the investment.  Also there are many interesting extras with the Blu-ray edition that the DVD does not have.",1296086400,4,4212,4.640054127198917

2394294,5,B000ATQYQU,"Mysterious Skin, put simply, is a story depicting the long-term effects of child sexual abuse. Two eight-year-old boys find themselves in the clutches of a predator, one for an entire summer, and one for two evenings over the course of two years.

Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), son to a single and perhaps too sexually casual mother. Even as a child Neil was always very sexually active with or without his little league coach initiating a relationship in his eighth year of life. After his coach disappears, Neil meets his best friend Wendy, but quickly develops an unhealthy penchant for harming and molesting other children. He grows up to become a teenaged hustler, tipping into a spiral of endless men and self-destruction, clinging to the belief that his coach was the only man to ever truly love him.

Brian (Brady Corbet) woke up one night in the crawl space of his home, a nosebleed dripping down his face, unable to recall how he came to be there after the cancellation of his little league game. Five hours of his life had been reduced to a pitch black void of nothing. He begins to have reoccurring nightmares, black outs, nosebleeds, and even wets the bed several times, but neither of his parents ever bother to ask what's wrong. He grows up to become a book nerd and sci-fi geek, convinced that he was abducted by space aliens during that five hour void.

At first glance, the two young men's stories appear to be only linked by the man who abused them, but as Brian's dreams, disguised behind the masks of space aliens, deepen in detail it becomes clear that Neil was present during his first memory lapse. Unaware, Neil continues his fast-paced game of Russian-Roulette, disregarding every warning, every reminder to ""be safe"" from his friends, meanwhile Brian is hunting him down, desperate to know exactly what happened to them that summer.

Adapted from the novel by Scott Heim (which will hopefully be sitting in my mail box come next week) and directed by Gregg Araki, Mysterious Skin is fearless with its potentially nausea-inducing subject matter, but always appropriately delicate at the same time. How anyone could think that this film condones pedophilia truly disgusts me, because it is made unquestionably clear that the abuse the two main characters endured profoundly messed up the both of them.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives the performance of a life-time as Neil. I can't think of a single scene of his in the film that could be categorized as ""easy."" He attacks the difficulty of the role head on without cutting any corners, smacking you in the face with the character's callousness and heartrending vulnerability.

Brady Corbet is equally compelling. It would be an understandable mistake to think his role as the sweet, soft-spoken Brian is the ""easier"" of the two leads, but in fact I would say that his emotional arc is far more challenging; travelling from innocent fallacies explaining the trauma of his past, to horrifying revelations of truth, he gracefully captures it all without once stepping over that line into melodrama.

The rest of the cast all give solid to amazing performances, flushing out the characters that comprised to two young men's increasingly overlapping universes.

Beautifully filmed, honestly written, acted and directed, I can't find much wrong with Mysterious Skin.",1281225600,10,3331,4.989189189189189
2394295,3,B000ATQYQU,"That's a pretty big statement coming from me, but there is just something about this subject that turns my stomach in a million different directions, and the way it is depicted on screen is far more graphic than I anticipated.

The film revolves around two boys, Neil and Brian, who happen to both experience abuse at the hands of their soft-ball coach.  Both boys are traumatized, but in drastically different ways.  As we are introduced to them on the outset of the film through voiceover, we realize that Brian doesn't remember the attack at all and comes to believe that he was actually abducted by aliens.  Neil, on the other hand, remembers almost too well.  While it is apparent that it has altered his life in disturbing ways, he holds that `summer' in high esteem as a big part of his life.  He felt loved and important and special.

My stomach was turning.

As the boys grow up they struggle to make much sense of their life.  Brian is haunted by nightmares that scare him, causing him to keep a dream diary that he only shares with another young woman who claims to have been abducted too.  Neil turns tricks, sleeping with every man who will look at him twice, sabotaging his own growth by his careless actions.  Brian's search for the truth about his childhood eventually brings the two boys together, and gives them both the opportunity to heal; sort of.

I have a few technical issues with the film.  For one, every adult in this film is a mere stereotype, and the acting on the part of those adult actors (aside from Elisabeth Shue, who manages to keep some dignity) causes these characters to come off like caricatures.  The coach, Brian's mother, Brian's father...and then you have some of the younger characters like Eric and Avalyn who also come off as stereotypical props.  Still, my biggest complaint is the blunt way in which the abuse is depicted.  I just have a very hard time considering this entertainment.  Now, before you jump on a high horse, understand that this is my personal opinion.  I have watched quite a few films dealing with controversial subjects and found them breathtaking in their gritty sense of realism and consider them masterpieces.  There just has to be SOME line, right?  I am very happy to read that the scenes were shot in such a way that the child actors didn't know what was going on (and with that being the case, those two young boys turned in BRILLIANT performances) but when you watch the film it almost seems far too realistic.  When it comes to subjects like child abuse, subtlety is far better in my opinion.

There is nothing subtle about `Mysterious Skin', unless you are talking about Joseph Gordon-Levitt's masterclass performance.

So, with all my issues here, I must say that Gordon-Levitt is brilliant here.  He understands the complexities of his character and he balances them out effortlessly.  You see the guarded insecurity that laces his outlandish and childish behavior.  The way he slinks around, his limbs almost moving in any given direction, give off an air of carelessness that is so layered and so detailed.  His defenses begin to crumble as he begins to realize that everything he thought lifted him up eventually brought him to his knees.

He hates himself.

I could never see this movie again, and I have a hard time even recommending it, despite Gordon-Levitt's OSCAR worthy performance.  This is just such a hard film to watch, and I have such an issue with the depictions of abuse.  It's odd because I was having a discussion with some friends the other day about films and artistic liberties and one friend asked if any film had ever gone `too far'?  I said no, because art is art and it serves a purpose.  Even if it is hard to stomach, it doesn't mean that it is `too far'.  That was before I saw this.  While I can't say that this film serves no purpose, I can say that this film went `too far' for me.",1276473600,28,3893,4.62536443148688

The second boy Neil lives a complete different life. He was molested by his baseball coach and has in his teens found an ""easy"" way of making money, hustling.

2394301,5,B000ATQYQU,"The film follows the lives of two boys who, at the age of 8, were molested by their little league baseball coach.  The divergence in their personalities as they grow older is quite telling: one boy embraces what happened and longs to feel loved by a man, while his counterpart represses the scenario and becomes (as one character in the movie describes him) ""asexual.""  Their reunion some 10 years after the fact ends in an intense and heart-pounding confrontation, amplified by a scene that can only be described as an exemplar of catharsis.

Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbett deliver amazing performances, exploring a range and depth of emotion often missing in film.  Both young men portray their character's unique perspective on the world perfectly: Gordon-Levitt in a numb and even nihilistic fashion, Corbett as a naive and trusting soul who has been gravely injured at a deep, psychological level.

The film rests in the same category of cinema as works such as ""The Mudge Boy"" and ""My Own Private Idaho.""  This is perhaps the most phenomenally dark gay-coming-of-age film to date!

The themes and issues of child molestation stand apart from those of homosexuality and the two are not confused, even in the minds of the protagonists.  Gordon-Levitt's character is avowedly gay while Corbett's is not.  The clear distinction between pedophilia and homosexuality is both welcome and refreshing.

Personally I am appalled at the 1-star rating some users have given this film for its content.  The film is graphic, disturbing, and shockingly provocative.  Yet the characters are believable and likable over-all, the direction is superb, and the whole work is enthralling.

Michelle Trachtenberg and Jeffery Licon deliver sound performances in their respective supporting roles.

2394306,4,B000ATQYQU,"The Bottom Line:

If homosexuality or child molestation are themes that disturb you then avoid this film, for it raises uncomfortable issues and steadfastly refuses to sweep them under the rug; however, it should also be noted that this is a very good character piece with fine acting (especially by Gordon-Levitt) and the courage to take the viewer to places that he or she almost never goes while watching an American film.

2394308,3,B000ATQYQU,"For all its focus on sexuality and abuse, the film's strongest points come in portraying teen angst in a real manner, better than even Stand By Me, as well as the loneliness children feel in small towns, especially the pointless frustration that talentless youths feel. This is because, for all the idolatry bestowed upon him by the three other teens: Wendy, Eric, and Brian, the fact is that Neil is utterly run of the mill and forgettable. And, at some level, he knows this, and reviles the others for their worship. The film has moments that evoke the best in films like My Dog Skip, My Life As A Dog, The Curse Of The Cat People, and Godzilla's Revenge, all terrific films that deal with often overlooked aspects of childhood. The film suffered many slings along the road to production- from bad reviews to attempts at censorship and banning, and, at a cost of $10 million made less than a tenth of that in box office, according to online sources. It's too bad, because films like this, despite their flaws, should be made in Hollywood, not by self-marginalized directors like Araki (who seems to revel in gay and sexually bizarre subcultural themes).

Mysterious Skin is a film that, upon rewatch, and even just after letting it settle in, will inevitably leave one wanting for more, but it does show that Araki is a filmmaker with potential, mostly via the screenplay aspect of the film, although Steve Gainer's cinematography also shows potential. It is not a film that, like those of Michelangelo Antonioni nor Akira Kurosawa, will dazzle you, but it will leave something within, and that's all to rare these days. If Araki can rein in his worst tendencies (such as the belief that sex is easy for anyone to get- including nerds like Brian and Avalyn, and that there are a plethora of buff gay men willing to pay for anonymous sex with strangers), which likely emanate from his own unresolved sexual issues, his art can soar. Here's hoping things work out, for him and us.",1231718400,3,1980,4.706051873198847

All said and done, this is a good, if not great film. I would lean towards great, and do lean towards great.

2394310,5,B000ATQYQU,"""Mysterious Skin"" was adapted for screenplay by director Gregg Araki from Scott Heim's novel.  Araki's reputation for bold films continues with this tale.  Araki was nominated for Best Director for the film by the Independent Spirit Awards.  He won the same type of award from the Seattle International Film Festival (Golden Space Needle Award), from the Rotterdam International Film Festival (MovieZone Award), from the Bergen International Film Festival (Jury Award) and from the Brisbane International Film Festival (Interfaith Award).  I found the theme of child abuse made this a very difficult film for me to watch.  The performances and the film's final frames made it rewarding.

Two child actors do excellent jobs in the film.  The wide-eyed George Webster who plays young Brian and Chase Ellison as young Neil who recently filmed with Julia Roberts in ""Fireflies in the Garden"" both do excellent jobs, despite the difficult context of their performances.

Brady Corbett who has been on TV's ""24,"" plays young blond Brian who has blotted out the memory and ""loses time,"" even though he is haunted by it.

The film, however, belongs to Joseph Gordon-Levitt who did such a great job in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stop-Loss/dp/B0013FSL1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stop-Loss</a>&nbsp;and was from TV's ""Third Rock from the Sun.""  He was nominated for ""Beakthrough Award"" by the Gotham Awards and won a Best Actor award from the Seattle Film Festival for this film.  As the teenage Neil, Joseph plays with great distrust to the world.  He is harsh and angry.

The most difficult to watch was Bill Sage as the baseball coach who takes advantage and abuses the children.  My reaction is that anyone who takes advantage of child in this way deserves capital punishment.  That said, Sage's good looks and pleasing smile spin a web in which these children fall due to parental neglect.

Brian's parents are played by Lisa Long who has worked on many TV shows including ""Desperate Housewives,"" ""Eli Stone"" and ""Dharma & Greg.""  Chris Mulkey who was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-Country-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000CQLZ8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North Country (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and works frequently on TV always has this look like he could flip you off or swear at you given the least provocation.  While he may be the greatest guy in real life, he excels at these roles.  Elisabeth Shue who was nominated for an Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" in 1996 plays Neil's single mother who is as centered on her social life as she is on her son's.

Jeffrey Licon plays Eric, Neil's best friend & eventually Brian's.  His flamboyant hair & makeup make him a standout in this small-town setting.  Some may recall him playing the Goth Kid God on TV's ""Joan of Arcadia.""  His role in the film is interesting, although one wonders at his unrequited love for Neil.  Perhaps his function in the film is to show how much Neil toughens up during his sojourn in New York.

Three supporting roles should also be recognized.  Michelle Trachtenberg from TV's ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" & who won a special Jury Prize for Breakthrough Performance from the Sarasota (I think that's right) Film Festival for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beautiful-Ohio/dp/B001DJ7PSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beautiful Ohio</a>&nbsp;does a good job as the flamboyant Wendy who moves to New York City and brings Neil there.  Mary Lynn Rajskub who plays on TV's ""24"" and appeared in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Miss-Sunshine/dp/B000K7VHQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Miss Sunshine</a>&nbsp;plays Avalyn Friesen who is on crutches and believes she was abducted by space aliens.  Of the guys who patronize Neil's personal business, the best performance is by Billy Drago as the AIDS-infected Zeke.  Drago often plays creepy characters, but this is one creepy guy who displays his bliss.  It was a weird mix, but a memorable performance.  (I hope that was makeup on his yellow teeth!)

""Mysterious Skin"" is a difficult but powerful film.  It repels even as it fascinates.  While I'm returning it the day after I watched it because I want it out of my house, it was an excellent film to watch.  The strange DVD extra where the two leading young men read excerpts from the novel point out to me how valuable a class in Oral Interpretation can be.

2394313,5,B000ATQYQU,"'Mysterious Skin' definitely tackles a wallop of a subject, and in doing so, it fearlessly portaits an utterly heart-breaking, though moving, and quiete often disturbing story that is ultimately powerful, and yes, mysterious.

The story is about two 18 year old boys, Neil and Brian, who were victims of sexual abuse 10 years ago by their little league coach (Bill Sage). The film focuses on each boy as Brian desperately tries to remember what happened to him while the other, Neil, can't forget. In Brian's search for answers, he comes across Neil in a group picture from their little league team whom he believes has the answer to what Brian calls his ""lost time"".

Directed by Greg Araki (who also adapted it from Scott Heim's novel of the same name), I expected something pretty sensational, even exploitative considering Araki's previous work. However, I was extremely impressed to see that Araki's direction and writing had really matured. The film was focused, complete, and controlled. In other words, it felt like I was watching something a vetran filmmaker had directed which is quite an accomplishment. Even with a small budget, the film never felt cheap or badly made. Araki uses many interesting camera tricks and placement that really make the film feel fresh and new.

The acting, especially from the film's two leads, is fantastic! Joseph Gorden-Levitt really proves he has some serious acting chops. Brady Corbet is equally wonderful but this is Levitt's moment. The suppoting cast is also great and, well, supportive.

It's no surprise that in dealing with this tough subject matter that the view will experience some difficult scenes to digest. However, rest assured, none are exploitative nor are they sensationalized. They are delt very delicately with and are there for a purpose. In fact, many of the unsettling scenes are remarkably powerful and leave the viewer an indelible impression.

2394315,1,B000ATQYQU,"From the trailer, I thought Mysterious Skin would act as an ample morsel in my dietary ""artsy-fartsy film"" plan. What I received in return was a film that documents the bitter residual effect of child molestation, and one that inflicts far too emotional pain in the viewer. One could argue that it's done in a tasteful way, as was the way the film was described to me by a clerk at Blockbuster (who was quite cryptic on the subject matter before I rented the film), but I would have to disagree. 'Mysterious Skin' boorishly attacks us with flashbacks that, while not overly graphic, do enough to the viewer to leave you asking, ""Why did I rent this again?"" This was certainly the case with my friends and I, who could do nothing more than shake our heads as we fast-forwarded through gratuitous nonsensically graphic scenes that could have been left out of the film completely while still accomplishing the goal of the director. There are some seriously hard-to-take portions of film and it often seems like the director is attempting to force-feed us the horrors that child-abuse will produce down the line.

The plot is based on two young men who are dealing with their shared pasts in different ways. One thinks he was abducted by aliens while the other still has a psychological bond with the man who took advantage of him. Both end up confronting each other as they confront their tragic past and form a common union that will eventually help lead to their healing.

There are plenty of films out there that are of high quality work, and Mysterious Skin is well-made on the art front, but the theme is far too strong for most to deal with, especially if you have experienced the trauma that comes with child-abuse. A solid soundtrack by Robin Gutherie adds to the desired ambiance, but is not enough to make this any type of film I would recommend.",1208304000,20,1853,4.646341463414634

2394317,5,B000ATQYQU,"But I have owned this movie for over two years, so I thought I should at least give some personal reactions(I don't think another rehash of the plot is necessary).

The ""tagline"" (I think that means the line that appeared on many of the original posters) is ""One can't remember...and the other can't forget."" Not many have pointed out that in a sense, Neil (Gordon-Levitt) is just as stuck back there in the past as Brian (Corbet) is. Neil knew he was gay before ""Coach"" picked him out, and, in fact, thought of their relationship as a ""love affair,"" and the feeling he had for Coach as ""love."" When he starts hustling, he tries to pick men who are middle-aged (like Coach), a bit chunky (like Coach), and whom he can trust, as he trusted Coach. He has NO romance or love in his life, and no sex, except insofar as he gets sex from his johns (which considering that they do the paying, is a fair amount!). So while Brian (Corbet) has blocked the (one night stand--with Neil, the thing lasted all summer) out of his mind, substituted an alien abduction, and feels no sexual attraction for anyone, Neil's life is, in spite of its adventurousness, a certail sense of accomplishment,  and, eventully, brutality--just as stuck as Brian's is. So while Araki shw us the widely-veering away from eachother lives of the two sexually abused children, it's clear that that, in a sense, the abuse has stopped the emotional development of both.

Their coming together, at the end, with Neil explaning to Brian what happened to him that night (which he has by now partially guessed), is a kind of a miracle, and we are left with a feeling of hope. Neil realizes what a destructive force Coach was, not only for Brian, but for him as well, and Brian accepts the reality of what happened to him, and (especially in the movie) seems to feel a real warmth for Neil.

I tried for months to get my transgender friend to watch this movie, but as soon as I told him what it was about, he said, ""No. I don't want to see it."" He slowly chanaged his mind, and we finally did watch it together. He never laughed (not even when Neil is getting blown under the table while annuncing a local baseball game), and said Neil didn't do anything for him (considering our similarities in taste in other similar matters, I'm not quite sure I don't take this with a grain of salt). What impressed him most about the movie, aside from its exquisite direction and acting, was that ""neither of the two eight year old actors--or perhaps even younger--would have to know ANYTHING about what the movie as about."" That is absolutely true. (Of course, they may have learned about it from older friends; I don't know),. But watch it carefully. With seemless editing, what seems to be a violation, and what seems to be a seduction, of two small boys, never involves either boy directly (""Here we go."" But Coach's face moves toward the camera, not the 8-year-old Neil). Compare this to, for instance ""The Innocents,"" in which Miles has to kiss his governess full on the mouth, recite a morbid and suggestive poem, and says some fairly nasty thing to her.
We never see any real sex; we never see an improper kiss (unless you count Eric's and Neils!). The language is way, way out there, and it leave no question as to what is going on, in words that I probably can't print here. For the viewer, this language makes every scene utterly real.

 Things and scenes i especially liked:

the way Neil's mother ""doesn't know"" what he does for a living; yeah, I bet she doesn't!
Avalen calls Brian out to her farm in the middkle of the night. There in the field lies a dead cow, drained of it's blood (aliens of course have done this, according to Avalen). It is slit up the center, and she urges him. ""Put your hand in!"" Eventually he does...and then, puts it in deeper, and deeper, until only his elbow shows. ""You didn't have to do THAT,"" says Avalen. Yes, he did.
The rapist and batterer of Neil uses a bottle of Johnson's Baby Shampoo to hit him with (among other things),. It says ""No more tears"" on it.
The way we follow Neil's thoghts in the final scene, as the camera pans up and up, until the two boys are little more than a speck on their couch. ""I wished I could tell him everything would be all right now, but I knew it wouldn't, so i didn't. I just tried to make him understand how sorry I was. I wished we could rise out of there, like two angels in the night..."" (Sorry, this is from memory; it's probably better in the film).

However, those who are able to handle it will find a disturbing, emotional journey in progress as the two boys, who lead disparate lives, eventually redisover each other and the complete truth is revealed about what happened to them so many years ago.  It's both amusing and sad that one of them thinks he was a victim of alien abduction; that's how his mind explained the trauma to him.

2394320,5,B000ATQYQU,"This movie is the best and the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but the film it turned out to be was not it at all.

Child molestation, rape, prostitution, drugs, fear, anger, love, hate, all play a important role in this film. Parts of it are ridiculous, and other parts of it are so horrible that you can't take your eyes off the screen.

The one scene that made this film worthy to me of 5 Stars is the scene where one of the main characters (who is a prostitute) gets violently raped. That scene is one of the most powerful and real scenes I believe to have ever been filmed. The domination, fear, and surrender are almost too real. I know people who have been raped, and rape scenes are always difficult to watch in films, but this scene has to be the most gut-wrenching rape scene I have ever seen.

The ending left me wanting more. The film was ok, it had you wanting to understand and help the characters, but the company that produced this film has done better. Yes it is a powerful story, and because it is so powerful I highly doubt I will ever watch it again. It will stay with me for a long time.

(And other reviewers have said that there is full frontal male nudity, but I do not recall seeing it. There is [...], and there is implied male nudity when one of the characters watches his mother have sex with her boyfriend, but I don't recall seeing his genitalia.)",1204416000,2,1410,4.25

2394322,5,B000ATQYQU,"I just saw this movie last night and felt compelled to write about it.  This movie shows how two boys deal with the very same sexual abuse from the same little league coach very differently.  Although both are adversely affected, the way their little minds (8 yrs. old) dealt and processed all of it sent them on very different paths for the next 10 years when finally they met up to help each other understand.

I can't say enough about the quality of the production, the acting in each role, the directing, and the story itself.  You can really feel each character on both sides of the abuse.

Words that come to mind are thought provoking, intriguing,  aware, captivating, artistic (the directing / framing shots), and emotional.

I love movies that do something that has never been done before.  Abuse may have been done before, but this movie's uniqueness lies in how the characters are developed; both the kids and the coach to give a perspective that has never been displayed in a movie.  The acting and directing are of the highest quality.

In rating this movie on it's own, I have to give it the 5 stars.  If I was rating the DVD, it would get 4 stars.  There is commentary and a a few extras of the actors rehearsing lines and reading the first 2 chapters of the book but I would have liked to see more behind the scenes footage and information as well as getting actor feedback on the film.

Also, do not be fooled by people who tagged this film with ""male full frontal nudity"" because you never see the front on the actors.  You see full nudity from the back, but front shots are waist-up and thighs-down.

I first watched this movie without reading the book, and I have yet to read it (though I hope to do so soon). I'd known about the main leads, namely Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet, from movies like Brick and Thirteen, respectively. Both outdo any other performances of their careers in this movie, however. It's haunting, chilling, entirely too disturbing to watch at times, but yet I found myself having to watch because I was so drawn in. Not a single moment went by when I wasn't completely fascinated, or when I wasn't feeling as though I was in the story myself. Beautifully written and directed, perfectly acted, and just the right amount of drama/action/all those other things movies tend to become too muddled with.

2394325,5,B000ATQYQU,"I did not know what to expect when I read the write up on this film or the reviews. As far as quality goes, I was pleasently surprised. I have a wide variety of movies in my collection. This , is by far one of the best. Perhaps that is because I have seen similar behaviour in real life. Jospeh Gordon-Levitt shows he is not just a ""one pony show"" as he stretches to the other end of the acting spectrum, comedy being at the other end. His tormented ""my pain is mine-just deal with me, this is how I ge male acceptance"" is done to perfection, never overdone. You never know where his character is going next emotionally. An entire movie could have been written around his characters' abuse by the coach, abandoment by his father, permiscuity  by his mother and deep feelings for his best female friend.

Abused by the same coach, the character of Brian(Brady Corbet)reacts totally different to his early childhood circumstances, including an emotionally detached father, a dominant mother and sexual abuse by this same coach. His path leads to a very interesting and understandable journey, as he has blocked out his abuse in an interesting way. The results of his abuse physical and emotional present themselves allthroughout his upbringing and launch him on a journey to find ""the other kid"".

Linking both abused teens is a gay friend who draws on the viewers' sympathty as he seems to fall for  both.

This is an ""-A-"" movie in every aspect. There was not a part that one could think might not be actually true. Someone behind the pen or camera on this book/film clearly lived this pain. This movie could not have come from anyone's imagination. Never boring, how anyone could rate this move a -B- or less , I cannot understand. Taken from pain, everyone delivers.

Corbet and Levitt (from TV's ""Third Rock From the Sun"") are strikingly credible in demanding roles, while supporting players Elisabeth Shue (as Neil's loose, permissive mother), Michelle Trachtenburg (as his New York friend, Wendy), and Bill Sage (as the Coach) turn in exemplary work.

The movie was satisfying but only when you factor out the prosepect of it having the potential to be better.  It could have been just as phenominal as the book if only it were slightly truer to it.
I wasn't completely dissapointed though.  The actors threw on the roles with impressive grace, slipping them over themselves as if they were truly their own new mysterious skins.  The direction is another thing I'd like to give a credit to, breathtaking and well-suited with the film's pace.

2394330,5,B000ATQYQU,"Mysterious Skin- Sensational, controversial, intense... so many words can describe this movie by Gregg Araki based on the novel by Scott Heim. The first time I watched this film, I was blown away by the display of raw emotions of the two young lead actors- Joseph Gordon Levitt (who plays young hustler Neil McCormick) and Brady Corbet ( who plays Brian, the shy teen who believes he was abducted by Aliens). There is a special, albeit disturbing connection between the two young men and the film captures the journey towards their reunion and the ultimate discovery of that particular event that connects them.

Gordon-Levitt delivers one of the most unforgettable performances I have seen in recent years. As a young hustler, his dark and secret past, allowed him to mask his emotions, and live life as if what he does for a living is something ordinary and mundane. With his eyes showing off nothing, and staring blankly into space, he goes from one job to another just as if he's replacing parts in an automotive shop or sorting out letters in a mail room. There are certain sex scenes that are graphic and disturbing, but it captures the world of Neil- dark, violent, uncaring... It's the only way he can go on- the absence of emotion and with it, the inability to truly love the people who care for him. Corbet also delivered an amazing performance, as Brian he is the shy, trusting and unassuming young man who is so obsessed with recording his periodic episodes of forgetfulness, that he opens himself to anyone who cared enough to listen...

There is a certain fulfillment in watching this movie and see it towards its end, it opens up a world that is there, perhaps a world apart from your own, but it's there and you may need or may not need to protect yourself to discover it.",1182124800,14,1788,4.655063291139241

This movie is a shocking look at pedophilia and its effects on the lives of two children.  It is at times difficult to watch, but the actors' performances are flawless.  Gordon-Levitt is stunning as the young hustler who lives a zombie-like existence, and Corbet is appealing as the naive boy who thinks he was abducted by aliens.

2394332,3,B000ATQYQU,"Mysterious Skin (Gregg Araki, 2004)

A good deal of my problem with Hollywood can be summed up by one unfortunate set of scenes in Gregg Araki's adaptation of Scott Heim's intriguing novel Mysterious Skin. All of these scenes concern Brian (Thirteen's Brady Corbet)'s relationship with Avalyn Friesen (Mary Lynn Rajskub of 24). Every time she appeared on the screen, I couldn't help but think ""this is the conception of `grossly overweight' [as she's described in the book] in California?"" That alone was enough to throw off my enjoyment of the film; the feeling was exacerbated by a number of small changes, the kind of thing I'd normally assume was done to preserve the film's R rating, but with more involved in each case. (For example, the lovely scene in the novel where Neal (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his mother (Elisabeth Shue), and Eric (Jeff Licon) go picnicking the day before Neal leaves for New York is torn to shreds; the portion of it that might have messed with the film's rating is there, in abbreviated, almost prudish, form, but all the rest of the scene has been dispensed with.)

Not a terrible movie, but do yourself a favor: see it before you read the book, so you don't know what you're missing until afterwards. ** ",1180137600,3,1237,4.7981220657277

2394338,4,B000ATQYQU,"Here is an unusual piece from infamous director Greg Arraki, who is known for such works as Nowhere, Splendor, and the Doom Generation.  This is the adaptation of the novel Mysterious Skin.  It deals with two young boys who are molested by their baseball coach.  They both take radically different paths in life, but both bear the scars of their oredeal.  This is a very deep and emotional work, but definitely not for the squeamish.

The film begins with the two characters(Brad and Neil) as children in the same baseball team.  Neil has begun to develop sexually, admitting to finding men attractive and basing his attraction of his single mothers lovers.  The other, Brad, is a shy and nerdy child, whose father wants him to join the baseball team despite his lack of interest.  Neil ends up becoming closer and closer to the coach, already attracted to him, and the coach ends up taking advantage of this and molesting him.  Though Neil in his naivity glorifies this, thinking of it as his first love.  The damage done to him is obvious in the images shown of him interacting with his peers.  Brian on the other hand isn't sure what happened to him.  He has vague memories of baseball practice, rain, a blue light, and being found at home wet with a nosebleed and no memory of what happened.

When we cut to the future the two kids have taken radically different paths in life.  Neil has become a rebel and a street hustler in his small town.  He abuses drugs and has unprotected sex with almost anyone he can.  He works as an announcer part time for the baseball field.  His close friends are often concerned about his dangerous lifestyle and nihlistic look at life.  Brian on the other hand is a college student and very straight laced. But he is strangely subdued, nearly asexual, and doesn't appear to have any friends.  He lives with his mother and goes to college.  His father left when he was young and has little to do with him.  He puzzles over his lost memory and nosebleeds, and is eventually convinced he was abducted by aliens.  This isn't done in a comedic fashion as he pursues it with unusual zeal.  Going as far as to contact stangers to compare stories.  Though they take different paths, the damage is obvious, and their worlds start to slowly draw together.

This was an unexpected movie for filmaker Greg Arraki.  He is known for his bizarre take on teen sexuality, surrealistic imagery, and fetish for alien abduction.  This is a much more subdued film, abandoning the surrealism and complex dialogue of his normal fare.  It still shows his fascination with alien abduction, but it portrayed in a very innocent fashion.  His interest in teen sexuality is there, but on a serious note.  Showing the damage done to two children and how their lives where changed because of it.  The portrayal is graphic, and will make you uneasy, but it feels less like a fetish of the directory(i.e. Larry Clark), and more an unflinching view of a traumatizing event.  The acting is excellent; Joseph Gordon Levitt makes a suprising turn from the youngest son on Third Rock From the Sun to the sleazy hustler Neil.  His portrayal is very believable, though Neil is cocky and arrogant but has a restless and desperate nature, seemingly scared of downtime and less sure of himself than he acts.  Brian was well played by Brady Corbet.  Playing a young adult that has shut off part of himself.  He pursues his life with a childlike innocence that is at times charming and sad at the same time.  As well as showing the deep torment he doesn't understand when his curiosity drives him to explore his past.

This film is well worth watching, but defintely not for squeamish.  From the uncomfortable scenes of Neil and his coach, to the damaged to the damaged youths they both become.  But beyond it is a quite remarkable movie worth watching for many reasons.",1177027200,4,3861,4.662222222222222

2394341,4,B000ATQYQU,"This is almost certainly the best Gregg Araki film to date, and one of the best independent films of recent years. Two young, Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Brian (Brady Corbet), find themselves transfixed by the past: Brian cannot remember everything that happened to him in the summer of 1981 when he played in Little League, and Neil remembers it all too vividly. Neil has become a hustler in his hometown of Hutchison, KS, while Brian is convinced he was kidnapped by aliens and has lost his memory as a result. It doesn't give too much away to say their paths coincide by the end of the film, as they find they knew each other that summer so long ago.

Araki has always been praised for his stylistic approach to films and his vision, but he's never had a film before that could well employ his themes of nihilistic youth, confused sexuality, and middle-class anomie quite as well as this one (in large part due to the fact that for once this film is based on another writer's material). Corbet and Gordon-Leavitt are both terrific in the leading roles, although the showier part of the tough charismatic Neil allows Gordon-Levitt to shine more than Corbet can with the meeker role of Brian. And shine Gordon-Levitt does: his is really a star-making performance. The actors in smaller parts--particularly the always welcome Elisabeth Shue as Neil's trashy mother, and Jeff Licon as his best friend, the sweet and less confident Eric--do very fine work, although the only real failing of the film is that Araki seems a bit unsure what to do with the smaller parts (they seem underwritten).

The movie then forwards to when the boys are about 18 or 19 and one of them cannot seem to remember what exactly happened to him.

 Neil is now a [..] charismatic teenage hustler and Brian is a nervous introvert obsessed with the idea he was abducted by aliens. Both boys were abused by the baseball coach but Brian instead thinks this trauma he remembered experiencing had to do with being abducted by aliens. All Brian can remember is having a bloody nose and finding himself somewhere else. At first he only remembers bits and pieces of the trauma.. Though he does happen to remember Neil and thinks he was also involved in this 'abduction' as he puts together the bits and pieces of what happened. He eventually ends up tracking Neil down and they both end up confronting the pain of what happened to them.

The ending is very heartbreaking and somewhat disturbing. This film is not just for shock value, it has a deeper meaning and is an eye opening look at child sexual abuse.

Though relatively short, the movie should have been even shorter for the alien abduction sub-theme gets way too much attention.

2394351,3,B000ATQYQU,"Though I'm now at age 18, I was initially introduced to the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt through his hysterical work on ""Third Rock from the Sun"", a television sitcom revolving around the concept of aliens coming to Earth to study human life.  Finding both his acting talents and comedic timing astounding on the series and finding him a bit attractive, I decided to persue reading about his other material and watching some of his other work.  I was floored when watching, ""Brick"", probably his greatest achievement yet.

I was very skeptical about watching this motion picture from the very start;  being a victim of unrecognized, verbally-unconfronted abuse, I was strongly afraid of the potential content and any memories it would bring back.  However, I had seen ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" countless times and decided it was truly time to face my own demons.

I cannot emphasize enough how the film effected me in both negative and positive forms.  I realized how much I cannot STAND children because of what happened to me at such a young age, and yet, children have NOTHING to do with it.  I realized how much being touched by a female might have changed my outlook on dating, now only fulfilling any desire to be with a male-partner.  I realized how much I took just non-sexual-contact for granted, thus now slowly becoming a bit more human in a relationship.

I hate how the Coach was presented as a mere human; he's NOT.  He's worse than a theif of personal items, and yes, worse than a murderer, because the victim has to live with the after-effects of the traumitizing event for the rest of their life.  The victim has to learn to COPE with the facts, and I can tell you this isn't an easy thing to accomplish.

It's an amazing but highly disturbing movie.  I'll never watch it again as long as I live, and I hope one day Joseph Gordon-Levitt will film a basic lovestory between two men as one of the leads.  THAT is what I want to see.

2394354,5,B000ATQYQU,"Movies about homosexuals, teenage hustlers, and child molesters have been being made for years. For some reason, they've suddenly surged in the past two years and became some of the most acclaimed films of the year. You've probably heard of movies like Brokeback Mountain and Transamerica, but here is another film...""Mysterious Skin."" It was one of the most acclaimed films of 2004 and proved furthermore that Joseph Gordon-Levitt can, in fact, act. I'm heterosexual, but when I heard about the movie...The premise sounded interesting. The film is interesting and contains great performances,

disturbing scenes, and is (probably) one of the best films of 2004. In the beginning, we meet two kids. One is Brian, a fairly normal kid who lost 5 hours of his life before waking up in his cellar with a nosebleed. Brian thinks that he was abducted by aliens. The other kid is Neil, who is quite different from Brian. Neil, on his first day of little league baseball, sees his coach for the first time and via voice-over admits to having feelings for him right off the bat. We, the audience, sense the minute we see the coach where the story is going and we're right...Coach molests Neil and sets up the chain of events leading to the remainder of the film. 10 years later, Neil (Levitt) is a gay teenage hustler who longs to get out of the ""hick town"" he lives in. Brian (Brady Corbett, who played Evan Rachel Wood's brother in Thirteen) is obsessed with his ""abduction"" and is searching for what really happened that night. Elisabeth Shue (who looks as beautiful as she did in ""Leaving Las Vegas"") plays Neil's clueless mother and there's Brian's dad who is really a completely useless character. The movie is deeply disturbing, some of the scenes involving Neil and his johns hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm not sure if the writer/director of the film was trying to shroud Brian's ""abduction"" in mystery, but if he was...It didn't work. Before I even saw the film, I explained the synopsis to a friend who guessed what actually happened. It was the same thing I had thought, we were both right. The movie is entertaining and will keep your eyes glued to the screen, especially it's stars. Levitt has proved himself in this film, Manic, and Brick to be one of the best young (he's 27) actors around right now. Corbett proves talent as well, but barely holds his own against Levitt. Great performances, disturbing subject matter...Great movie.

2394363,4,B000ATQYQU,"The independently produced ""Mysterious Skin"" is a poignant and certainly different coming of age movie, written and directed by Gregg Araki.  The film represents an account of two young boys growing up in tiny town of Hutchison, Kansas, Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey.  McCormick played by both Chase Ellison(as an 8 yr. old) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt(as a teen) and Lackey played by George Webster and Brady Corbet both played on the same Little League team.

Neil was the product of a single parent household namely his free spirited mother played by Elisabeth Shue.  He was shrewdly seduced into an aberrant sexual relationship by his pedophilic baseball coach.  Years later has seen his evolution into a homosexual teenaged male prostitute who flees to New York to increase his chances for action.

Brian, meanwhile, was a shy, introverted child prone to nosebeeds and bed wetting.  An unexplained episode as an 8 year old in which he had a five hour memory lapse apparently patterned his adolescence.  While growing up he believed that he'd been abducted by aliens.  This conviction shaped his existence and caused him to reach out to another who apparently shared his experience the peculiar Avalyn Friesen played by Mary Lynn Rajskub (who plays the quirky Chloe on TV's 24).

Brian meanwhile had a strong belief that an experience shared by Neil and himself had a major impact on their lives.  Brian looked forward to Neil's return to Kansas at Christmas time to enlighten him.

Araki portrays the lives of the boys in a gritty, revealing fashion.  No holds are barred as Neil's hustling lifestyle filled with violence and abuse is graphically portrayed.  The fragile psyche of Brian is revealed to be the product of a horrific and tabooed encounter in his early childhood.",1154736000,2,1780,5.010204081632653

2394365,5,B000ATQYQU,"A must-see masterpiece, ""Mysterious Skin"" is Gregg Araki's brave, brilliant and soul-shattering film about that touchiest of all subjects - pedophilia.  Based on the novel by Scott Heim, ""Mysterious Skin"" is brutally frank and honest in its approach to the topic, forcing us to face the issue head-on without comforting filters and without concern for offending audience sensibilities.  Yet, it is a supremely humane film, illuminating the darkest corners of its characters' psyches in an effort to help us better come to terms with the devastating consequences of this sadly all-too-common tragedy.

Set in a small town in Kansas in the early 1980's, the story focuses on two seemingly unrelated youngsters:  Neil, who knows he's gay at a very young age and turns to male prostitution at the age of 15, and Brian, who starts experiencing strange, unaccounted-for ""blackouts,"" which he naively attributes to his being abducted by UFOs.  But the boys share a far more sinister past, inextricably linked together by a molestation experience that continues to haunt them and that has marked and scarred them in radically different ways.

Because of its refusal to flinch at or turn away from the sordid reality of its subject matter, ""Mysterious Skin"" is not a film everybody will be able to sit through.  It is ugly and harsh and almost impossible to watch at times, for there is no denying that what it shows us is deeply and profoundly disturbing and that it disgusts and offends us - as indeed it should - at the very core of our beings as humans.  Yet this is no cheesy exploitation film, but rather a heartfelt and compassionate work of art that makes us see the horror of the situation in a truly empathetic way.  We come to care very deeply for these boys as we are forced to see what it is they're going through and to share in their pain.

Moreover, Heim and Araki have populated their world with unforgettable characters, all beautifully enacted by first rate performers: Michelle Trachtenberg as Neil's closest friend, Wendy, the one anchor of support Neil can count on to always be there for him even in his darkest moments; Jeffrey Licon as Eric, a gay teen with a warm heart whose unrequited love for Neil provides some of the most touching moments of the film; Mary Lynn Rajskub as a sad and lonely young woman also convinced that she has been abducted by aliens and who reaches out to Brian in love and friendship; Elizabeth Shue as Neil's well-meaning but tragically self-centered mother whose carelessness in leaving Neil alone with his coach is the catalyst that gets the tragedy rolling; and Bill Sage, in a very brave turn  as the coach himself,  whose actions have far-reaching consequences for both the boys involved.  Without exception, all these actors, including the ones playing Neil and Brian  as children, turn in mesmerizing, stellar performances.

But the real acting honors go to Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet, two extraordinary young men who, as Neil and Brian, make a tremendous mark on our hearts.  Gordon-Levitt, in particular, is phenomenal in capturing the many moods of his character, beautifully conveying the sweet innocence that lies so deeply buried under a harsh, unemotional exterior that even his closest friends have a hard time locating it.  Corbet is also terrific as the nerdish Brian, a good-natured lad who slowly but surely comes to remember and understand the devastating event that has shaped and defined his life.

The movie shows how, in Neil's case, the early childhood experience has made it impossible for him to view sex as anything but a ""business transaction,"" thus explaining his turn towards prostitution.  He acts out his anger and confusion by indulging in self-destructive behaviors and by shutting himself off from any kind of rich emotional attachments with anyone other than his platonic friend Wendy.  Brian, for his part, has responded by becoming, essentially, asexual, a means of subconsciously recoiling from the personal violation that occurred to him as a child and of avoiding having it ever happen to him again.  Their final scene together, in which long-festering wounds are at last opened and the ""healing"" begun, is devastating and unforgettable in its power and intensity.

For, despite the darkness of the subject matter, ""Mysterious Skin"" is, finally, an optimistic, hopeful film, one that acknowledges the power of self-acceptance in making a fractured person whole again.  Beautifully written and directed by Araki, ""Mysterious Skin"" provides a heartbreaking experience that will burrow its way into the deepest recesses of your heart and stay with you for a very long time.  It is one of the few truly great films of the past several years, a complete work of art.  See it.",1153094400,8,4768,4.997471554993679

2394367,5,B000ATQYQU,"I found this film to be really excellent even though I personally found the scenes involving child sexual molestation very disturbing.

I would like to point out several strenghts of the film:

First, this film demonstrated the paths that different people may take after being sexually molested. Neil McCormick (wonderfully played by Joseph Gordon Levitt) was sexually molested by his little league coach when he was 8. He was used to help seduce other boys and he quickly learned many sexual tricks and ways to manipulate his molester. This leads him to be a male prostitute, totally in control of his older clients. The path for Brian Lackey (well played by actor Brady Corbet) was a very different path with Brian having a complete lapse in memory and yet feeling some very dark secret has happened to him which he attributes to being abducted by aliens.  The film perfectly captures the impact of molestation on a child and the way this impact is carried into their later years, behaviors, and relationships.

Second, this was just excellent film making. The actors are superb. Elizabeth Shue is a bad but loving mother for her son Neil. I found it interesting that Neil's mother had poor supervision skills and Brian's mother had over protective supervision skills and yet both boys were sexually molested.

Third, this film does an exceptional job of creating the world of a child sexual molester. The coach, played by Bill Sage, has all the signs of a child sexual molester. He makes friends with the parents and gets their trust. He had toys and other child friendly objects in his home to play with the kids he is seducing. He has a house full of pin ball machines and computer games and kid food. He gradually seduces Neil, using photography, play, and games in the seduction process. These scenes made me very uncomfortable because the child is under the power of the adult who has much more ability and resources to manipulate the situation.

This is probably the best psychological exploration of child sexual molestation and its effects on film. A difficult film at times but well worth it.",1152748800,3,2104,4.830555555555556
2394368,5,B000ATQYQU,"The title sequence begins on an alien washed-out palate with streaks of color that airs the feeling of a Pollock painting, and then the camera focuses on a kid we know nothing about before fading away to ""their stories.""  They are the main characters of the movie, Brian and Neil, who have an emotional journey to contend with.

When Brian's story begins, it is fragmented, both by his painful memory loss and the editing.  He doesn't know what's going on, but he feels it has something in particular to do with UFOs, and starts hunting down information on his repressed memories.  Neil's story is much more stable... at first.  His is an accepting and nonconfrontational viewpoint into the world of homosexuality and prostitution, yet strangely surrounded by artwork: Pollack, Rothko, Vermeer, etc. As Brian's story progresses, his life will begin to fall into a bit more order, while as Neil's story progresses, it's going to get more messy and off-kilter.

The ""mystery"" designation on the genre of this film is a bit of a misrepresentation: it really doesn't take long for the audience to understand what happened to both of them.  However, rather than watching it for any kind of twist, it's much more inspiring to watch this movie with sympathy, because for some reason I can't quite understand, every character in this movie is amazingly sympathetic.  The two main boys' emotional takes on life keeps the movie flowing wonderfully while the supporting characters' additions keep it from becoming too static.  Sometimes there's an aura of inevitability, but mostly throughout the movie the real surprises come from trying to figure out where the characters will go next in such a bizarre landscape.

The cinematography is wonderful.  The composition of the shots almost always perfectly fit the internal musings of the characters, and things are left just enough confusing when confusing and revealed when revealed that the audience is almost always on perfect equal ground with the characters. The acting supports it well.  I didn't even really see actors, I pretty much accepted the characters as who I was actually watching, Neil and Brian.

Finally, the soundtrack is pretty good and keeps the tone of the movie under control.  Music as well as cinematography create graphic matches that tie two seemingly different characters pretty well together.

2394369,5,B000ATQYQU,"A most powerful and poignant look at the effects of pedophelia.  In the beginning ""Mysterious Skin"" feels like it is two different movies playing out simultaneously.  Neil McCormick's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) story unfolds in an disturbingly realistics fashion, while that of Brian Lackey (Brady Corbet) comes across as so sci-fi that it initially seems not to connect to the other tale at all.  However, as the movie progresses and one begins to realize the terrible connections between the young men, it's unsettling nature deepens and the discomfort the viewer experiences grows more ominous.  By the end of the film, Neil's revelation is a surprise only to the character of Brian, the audience having already figured it out and having been frustratingly helpless to prevent it.

""Mysterious Skin"" is brilliantly directed.  Many full front close-ups of characters speaking directly into the camera draw the viewer into the souls of the troubled boys.  A few naked backsides and some hands grabbing at the waitbands of pants are all that is shown of the sex.  The rest of the sex is filmed in tight shots with the details being left to one's imagination.  This is as it should be, for the subject matter is so disturbing, that to have shown any more would have rendered the film intolerable to view.

The entire cast does a fine job, but it is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's exceptional performance that moves this film from the very good category into that of great.  It is only in helping Brian to begin the process of healing that Neil himself realizes how broken he, himself, is.  ""Mysterious Skin"" is a phenominal movie that is very difficult to watch.",1149724800,13,1649,4.934782608695652
2394370,5,B000ATQYQU,"As the issue of pedophilia and child predators becomes increasingly prevelant in our culture, Mysterious Skin provides a disturbing, heart breaking, and ultimately hopeful portrayl of the after affects of such tragedy.

Everyone deals with psychological trauma differently. Whether one acts out or retreats into an inner shell all depends on the individual, and as we saw in the film, each consequence has its set of unique obstacles.

Both Neil McCormack (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and Brian Lackey (Brady Corbet) were molested by the same man. While Neil has turned this ordeal into an ongoing case of self deprecation through prostitution, Brian is convinced that he was the victim of an alien abduction--while in reality he was so traumatized by the events that his mind simply blocked them out.

As the two protaganists paths finally cross, their secrets are revealed in a series of flashbacks that while not graphic, are equally disturbing. A series of events after Neil's move to New York City prove that his line of work is downright hazardous, and in the end, it is up to him to pick himself up from ruin and claim a new lease on life.

The performances from both lead actors as well as supporting roles from Michelle Trachtenberg were outstanding--far and away superior to their peers in every respect. Director Gregg Akari shot the film in a dreamy and downright beautiful manner, with mesmerizing sunsets and lush scenery being plentiful throughout.

In conclusion, if you are not offended by such subject matter, this film is highly recommended. While clearly not appropraite for young children, it is indeed about them, and the fight for their innocence and well-being, all against our often unpleasant world.",1149638400,4,1719,5.081560283687943
2394371,4,B000ATQYQU,"Be forewarned: This film takes a frank look at pedophilia, prostitution, and rape from the perspective of two sexually abused boys. If you are honestly interested in understanding the long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse, director Gregg Araki's film is an extremely thoughtful and non-exploitive examination of a painful and relatively neglected film topic.

In Hutchison, Kansas, during the summer of 1981, Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Brian (Brady Corbett), are molested by their little league baseball coach (Bill Sage). Brian's response to the abuse is to blackout and to forget what happened to him. In order to account for his two blackouts, Brian imagines that aliens abducted him. Neil, however, becomes the team's star player, and develops a summer long relationship with Coach. Unlike Brian, Neil both remembers and attempts to control and re-experience his exploitation by becoming a male prostitute.  Eventually, Brian, haunted by bizarre dreams, seeks to end his general sense of malaise. After a fellow alien abductee encourages him to follow the clues from his dreams, Brian discovers that he and Neil share a common past.

So many of the things in this film are spot on. In point of fact, boys are more often abused by babysitters, coaches, and teachers.  And while Neil tells his best friend Wendy about the abuse (after making her witness his abuse of another boy), neither boy tells his parents.  Also, there is no recognizable symptom of sexual abuse; the two boys respond to their experience in remarkable different ways. Neil identifies with his abuser; Brian disassociates himself from his sexuality. Though both boys develop compulsive behaviors, the film skirts clear of oversimplifying their psychological distress. And probable the most painful scene in the film, the revictimization of Neil at the hands of a client, reminds us of one horrible after effect of childhood sexual abuse; abuse victims are more likely to be raped as adolescents and adults.

The weakest links in this film are the portrayals of Wendy (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Mrs. M. (Elisabeth Shue). Both Trachtenberg and Shue are too wholesome for their roles. The ""edge"" that both Wendy and Mrs. M. should have ( after all, Mrs. M is a single mom who works as a cashier by day while entertaining herself with an ever changing stream of bedmates by night, while Wendy insinuates that she lacks parental care and attention) is conveyed through visual gimmicks (the ubiquitous cigarette, tough make-up and wild hair styles) rather than compelling acting.

Unlike others who have seen this film, I do not think that Araki was seeking to portray Coach as a nice guy, or even as a morally ambiguous guy. Rather, Araki is showing us a true sexual predator - a wolf in sheep's clothing, as it were.  Sexual predators work very hard to establish trust -- which requires at least a veneer of niceness - since trust is necessary in order for them to do what they want to do to their child victims.  If anything, I thought Araki showed how deeply confusing and painful it was for Neil to grapple with what he wanted to believe about Coach -- that Coach loved and cared about him -- with reality -- Coach's interest in Neil was limited to Neil's usefulness as a means of sexual satisfaction.

The film's final scene, in which Brian and Neil begin to heal a traumatic betrayal of trust by trusting each other, will stay with me for a very long time.",1148860800,99,3442,4.949740034662045

This rendition of the man-boy sexual abuse theme highlights the differing (though both pathetic) responses of two different boys.  It also distinguishes between two approaches of the male-on-male pedophile: the ""grooming"" and seduction of Neil versus the one-off (or maybe two, counting that Halloween) rape of Brian.  Survivors of childhood abuse will recognize many elements of Brian's experiences: the fragmentary and peripheral recollections (e.g., blue porch light), the nose-bleeds and fainting years after the fact, the desperate preoccupation with improbable, fabricated ""screen memories"" like the UFO abduction, and the absence of resolution at the end of the film. Finally, let me add: (1) Survivors should not watch this film unless they are VERY stable.  (2) Some viewers may find a few of the rent-boy sex scenes a bit repulsive.

As adults, one is a hustler, the other obssesed with UFO's and his childhood blackouts.  At the end the ""big secret"" about the nature of his blackouts is revealed....I bet you can already guess what it is.  Well, its no secret in the movie either, and the pretense of a secret or a mystery is laughable.  Its obvious.  So there's no real secret or mystery, what about the characters?  The two protaganists, beyond the fact that they were victimized, are not likeable.  One is a perp himself, the other is shallow, introverted, and withdrawn.  Yes, these are two basic routes that people take when dealing with this kind of abuse, but these characters are painted too broadly to be sympathetic.  Well then, what about the overall theme of abuse?  Is there anything redeeming or instructive for the viewer?  The answer is a resounding no.  What the film amounts to is watching two kids get abused, watch them act out in screwed up ways as adults, wrestle with the emotions, and ultimately, come to no insight or resolution themselves.  Nothing is stated about the ultimate fate of the abuser or the two victims.  So what's the point?  I'm not sure.  You do feel horrible for the two main characters, but beyond that, there IS no point.

Now for the worst part.  Near the end of the movie, one of the characters describes in graphic detail exactly what was done to the boys.  Worse than that, he describes the events in weirdly gleeful terms.  As he describes it, we see the events acted out...not in detail, but still.  Now, I have no problem with this if it is to serve some greater artistic end.  Unfortunately, here it doesn't.  The only point I can see is perhaps if someone didn't realize that this type of sick stuff goes on, they may have some realizations.  I DO know that it goes on, I DON'T need to hear it described UNLESS it serves some greater purpose.

This is very very potent and sensitive material, and in the right hands it can make for a powerful movie.  In this film, it has a disturbing hint of compassion exploitation.

Let me just say finally that just before I watched this, I watched a film called Tarnation that touched on some of the same topics in a much much deeper way....",1145836800,16,2307,4.493975903614458
2394377,5,B000ATQYQU,"I read Scott Heim's novel ""Mysterious Skin"" a number of years ago, and found it powerful and challenging.  When I learned that Gregg Araki was making a film based on the book, I was apprehensive.  ""Msterious Skin"" deals with the long lasting effects of child abuse.  The last thing one wants when approaching this subject from an artistic stand point, is to be in any way exploitive.  The good news is that Mr. Araki's has triumphed - his is a brilliant film.  The performances throughout are outstanding - especially that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an in-your-face gay teen who uses sex as a means to an end - whether hustling or simply giving it away.  Brady Corbet delivers in the quieter role of Brian, who has so effectively blocked the memory of his abuse that he has come to believe that he may have been a victim of alien abduction.

This is a tough little film, dealing with topics that most people shy away from - child sexual molestation, drug abuse, prostitution and homosexuality.  Araki doesn't flinch or shy away from any of them.  It is a testsment to his incredible talent that he has made a film from this material which is both palatable and compelling.",1144713600,130,1172,4.6231884057971016
2394378,5,B000ATQYQU,"When Brian was eight years old, five hours of his life disappeared.  One minute he was at a Little League baseball game somewhere in the middle of Kansas, and the next thing he knew his sister found him hiding in the basement with his nose bleeding.  By the time he is a teenager, Brian is convinced that he was the victim of an alien abduction.  He even has a clear memory of a flying saucer passing over his house, but the becomes consumed by dreams that may unlock the secret of what happened during those missing hours.  Eventually he remembers another kid being there that night.  That would be Neil, who was the star of the Little League team, while Brian was the worst player.  Dazzled by his coach (Bill Sage), Neil ends up going home with him after a game one day and after being seduced with video games and cereal, is sexually molested.  This situation continues throughout the summer.

The tagline for this 2005 film says that one boy cannot remember, while the other cannot forget.  The truth does not become clear for Brian (Brady Corbet) until he finally meets up with Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) again, but we end up putting the pieces together early on in this one.  Gregg Araki (""Nowhere"") adapted Scott Heim's novel and directed the film, and the result is an unsettling film about child abuse.  To be clear, you no more see any actual child abuse in ""Mysterious Skin"" any more than you see Janet Leigh get murdered in the shower scene in ""Psycho,"" but Araki films and cuts these scenes so that you are convinced that what you are not seeing is right beyond the frame of the camera.  It is not gratuitous to say that Araki gets right in the face of his characters, which means he gets right in our faces as well, so do not be surprised if you feel compelled to stop the film from time to time because it gets intense.

""Mysterious Skin"" is about what happens to the victims of pedophilia, and in that regard it takes its two characters to the extremes.  Brian remembers nothing, but is subject to nightmares and blackouts, and when a woman expresses a sexual interest in him he freaks, knowing none of the reasons for any of these aberrant behaviors.  But it is Neil who is the central character of the narrative because he not only remembers what happens, his psyche is defined by it and he is recklessly seeks opportunities to repeat the experience.  Having learned to please an older man, that becomes Neil's sexual identity, and if that means selling himself to every man in town two times over, then that is what he will do.  When they becomes boredom for him, Neil heads for the big city, oblivious to the warnings of what can happen there by his friend Wendy (Michelle Trachtenberg), who knows he has a bottomless black hole where other people have a heart.  Neil tells her everything, so she knows why, but she is not the one who gets to make it clear to him as to why the last ten years have been a descent into the abyss.

This is a disheartening film because it documents the damage down to these two boys without a hint of what is to be done about it.  Gordon-Levitt deserves the same sort of accolades that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal received for ""Brokeback Mountain,"" but those were not forthcoming because ""Mysterious Skin"" is not about the love that dares not speak its name.  It is not any type of love at all.  These two characters learn how they are linked together forever because of what was done to them and that their lives are ruined because of it.  In the end they do not learn that there is a light at the end of the tunnel; they simply that they are in the tunnel and why it is that the light has gone out from their lives.",1144540800,10,3675,4.444113263785395
2394379,5,B000ATQYQU,"I expected to dislike this movie, since the scenario which I had read sounded very bleak and disturbing... not to my particular taste, but perhaps, appealing to someone else.  Nevertheless, the good reviews persuaded me to purchase the DVD and see it for myself.  Although at many points in the story I was greatly saddened and even disturbed, taken as a whole, the film was an excellent, profound and provocative portrayl of a sensitive and extremely difficult subject.  The story was presented with great integrity using a stark and unblinking style which avoided the obvious maudlin and didactic pitfalls of the subject matter.  The acting was excellently done and the film, which could have been hopeless and depressing, was ultimately an uplifting and rewarding experience without betraying the very negative and saddening realities of the story.

2394380,5,B000ATQYQU,"Gregg Araki's ""Mysterious Skin,"" based on a novel by Scott Heim, is a film that is extremely difficult to watch in places, but those who stick with it will be rewarded with one of the most powerful endings of any film in recent memory. The protagonists are Brian and Neil, two eight-year-old boys who are teammates--though not friends--on a Little League team in their small Kansas town. Ten years later, the shy, immature Brian (Brady Corbet) is convinced that he was abducted by aliens during the summer he was on the team; meanwhile, Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has become an icy, closed-off New York street hustler, openly admitting he was the sex slave of the team's coach, turning tricks in the vain hope of recapturing what he had that summer. The sci-fi mystery aspect of the plot is dispensed with quickly. It becomes obvious in the first half-hour what really happened to Brian; the real suspense lies in when Brian and Neil will finally meet again, and what will happen when they do. That meeting comprises the film's final scenes, and it will twist your heartstrings into knots. In the end, this isn't even so much a film about pedophilia as it is an indictment of a society that carelessly chews up and spits out children. Brian and Neil aren't the only victims on display here; Avelyn (Mary Lynn Rajskub), the handicapped young woman who shares with Brian the belief that she was kidnapped by aliens, is if anything even more pathetic than he (the film doesn't spell out what really happened to her, but it's all too easy to guess). Neil's friends Wendy (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Eric (Jeffrey Licon) are also sad cases in their own way, unwanted and unappreciated. All of these performers are superb, especially Gordon-Levitt, who gives as Neil one of the great tragic performances of the modern cinema. There are scenes in this film--particularly one toward the end between Neil and a sadistic john--that are harrowing almost beyond belief. But if you can come through them, you will be filled with admiration for Araki for making a film of such unflinching honesty and power, and with love for the sad, brutalized teenagers he portrays. Steve Gainer is the cinematographer, his camera brilliant and insinuating. The extras on this DVD include Corbet and Gordon-Levitt, as themselves, reading sections from Heim's novel. It doesn't really enhance our understanding of the film, but it's a blessed relief to see the happy, healthy young actors on screen.",1144108800,6,2471,4.928057553956834

Greg Araki directs with the same visual flair seen in his previous films, but this time brings emotional clarity and warmth as well.  The acting in this film is spectacular, and gives the audience a complete understanding of experiences they (hopefully) might not otherwise know.  Unfortunately this film has been niched as ""gay cinema,"" but this film eschews the usual sexual titillation and hackneyed plotting of that genre.  I was haunted by this film long after the credits rolled.

Mysterious Skin features subjects many films won't even touch and is filmed mostly in closeups leaving you unable to avoid sevral uncomfortable moments. Director Gregg Araki has made plenty of stylish cartoonish films like The Doom Generation but in this film he oviously respects the book he's adapting so much he tones down his excesses letting the actors shine. Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a starmaking performance is great in the difficult part of the hustler looking for love in all the wrong places. Some of the sexual encounters are harrowing but they are never trashy. A beautiful score by Harold Budd and Robin Guthrie give the movie an often dreamlike feel so it never gets too harsh. Mysterious Skin eventually brings the two very different characters together in the end leading to a haunting finish.

The characters were well played and they touch your heart each in their own way.  I can not forget to mention how cute some of them are both guys and girls(which is always a plus in a really good movie).  This movie is not for those with weak stomaches, homophobia, or sensitivity to sexual abuse issues (rape, child molestation, prostitution).  There are some scenes that many would find uncomfortable.

2394391,3,B000ATQYQU,"Inner demons being what they are, and seeing how they are inextricably bound to the drive to create art - something outside oneself - it was only a matter of time until we had a movie about the devastation that child abuse brings into the lives of children.

  This movie is horrible to watch, because it does not shrink from the pain of pulling off an unhealed scab.  This movie is beautifully done for the same reason.

  From the arrogant, abusive, self loathing of Neil (Joseph Gorfon Levitt), a teenage gay prostitute, his emotionally self-involved mother (Elizabeth Shue), the UFO obsessed Brian (Brady Corbett), every single role in this film is superbly acted and nuanced.

  This film is awful in content, truthful in the telling, raw in story, and given a light hand in directing that makes you feel you are there.  The aspect of the plot that gets repeated, a point that is for others to discuss is that it implys that child molestation is sexually gratifying and pleasant for the child.  That implication creates an unspoken complicity of the child that I don't think any society wants to delve into, and I'm not sure it is even a good directoral choice for this film.  It muddies the message.

  Still, the message is unmistakable, that these characters will absolutely never recover from what was done to them as children.  It is too bad that in all these years of filmmaking, we have never been able to get a filmmaker to make a similar message regarding the rape of women.  I've actually had filmmakers say that rape is irrelevant to character, a plot device and nothing else.

  I can not give this movie 5 stars, because one of the qualities of a great film to me is that it is entertaining.  This isn't.  It isn't even cathartic.  It is fantastically realized, but it is predominantly a trip down the sewer with (Neil) someone you don't like and can not trust.  You feel sorry for him, but no real solution is forthcoming.  It is real... but then, is that really what anyone wants in a movie?  No wonder movie theatres are dying.

  It goes down to 3 stars because I can not unreservedly recommend this film.  I will be surprised if I ever recommend this film to more than 3 people in my life.  So ultimately, it means that this incredible talent of storytelling, acting, directing, and all other aspects of this film are wasted on something that may only be viewed by the artsy intelligencia, and voting members of the Academy of Motion Pictures.  What a waste.  A really fantastically well done, truly ""horrible"" film.",1139097600,12,2539,4.631460674157303
2394392,5,B000ATQYQU,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt annoyed me tremendously on 3rd Rock from the Sun, mainly because the entire show was just stupid. I had heard, however, so much acclaim for his acting. This movie redeemed him. I have seen many ""teenage hustler with a bad past"" movies, including several from TLA or similar movie houses. This one was so different. Gordon-Levitt's portrayal was so much more complex than the norm. His ability to portray someone with a facade of a ""bottomless black hole"" where his heart should be, yet to subtlely reveal his sorrow, hurt, and tenderness was amazing. I felt what he was feeling, even though the friends in the movie did not always feel his emotions. That to me was very effectively done. He got into the walk, the talk, the attitude and feel of a hustler. And, by the way, he was not really a hustler, he was a prostitute. There is a difference!

The children actors were phenomenal. I was shocked that they found children that were able to so effectively portray the trauma and psychology of child sexual abuse.

The imagery was well done, including a scene showing the innocence of young Neil in a kitchen with his coach eating cereal and throwing it around the kitchen. One of the most painfully powerful scenes was of cereal all over the kitchen floor with male sexual fluids in the middle of the mess.  Innocence corrupted. Childhood interrupted.

As for the sexual scenes:

While there were a couple of graphic depictions of sex, I think they were very tasteful GIVEN THE TOPIC. That said, don't make this a family movie night picture.

Sadly, this movie presents a reality that is horrible and unforgivable. It will, therefore, leave you thinking a lot, emotionally drained, and just ... it's hard to explain.

Ok, so a few negatives (no impact on the film, but have to point it out):

Not quite sure why Elizabeth Shue got so much credit in the movie. The box emphasizes her ""moving portrayal"". That's just crap. Her role was simple and unimaginative and I suppose she brought the straight white men to the theatre and made them feel less guilty about watching teenage boys have sex.

Likewise, the mother and sister of Brian were like shells, almost as if they grabbed two people off the street and told them to read a few lines into a camera. Pitiful.

Watch the movie. It is truly a great film and I am not sure why I had never heard about it before. I am planning a movie night with friends and this will be a candidate.",1138752000,7,2453,4.605504587155964
2394393,4,B000ATQYQU,"I bought this movie based on the reviews I heard on LOGO.  One critic went as far as to say it was superior to Brokeback Mountain.  So as I sat down to watch this movie I quickly realized the subject matter.  Child abuse.  I was quickly turned off by the attitude of the character Neil played by Jason Gordon-Levitt.  The movie is about two boys who have a similar experience of being molested by the same man, their little league coach.  Neil goes on to turn tricks with men as a teen and Brian forgets those few hours of his life and now thinks he forgot because he was abducted by aliens.  Brian begins his search for Neil thinking he may be the key to learning about his alien abduction.  These are two completely different characters.  Neil who is self destructive, going with men despite the warning of his friend to be safe.  Brian the more innocent and gullible boy just trying to find his way.  When they finally meet and Neil explains what happened, I was completely taken in by the movie.  As far as 1/2 way through the movie I was thinking to myself, why am I watching this.  By the end of the movie, especially the end, whe Neil is explaining and very tenderly comforting Brian I was thinking Wow, what a movie.  It's very emotional.  This movie is not for everyone.  Certainly the graphic sexual encounters by Neil will turn a lot of people off as it did me as I bought into the fact that this was an underage teen.  However it was definitely worth sticking with it till the end.",1138579200,5,1493,4.351449275362318
2394394,5,B000ATQYQU,"I think by it's very nature and subject matter this movie is not for everyone but this movie overwhelmed me. I hadn't read the book or seen Araki's other movies.  I didn't expect that much but if you were molested as a kid and have tried to deal with it you will understand this movie and its two main characters. Why aren't there more movies that deal with the harsh realities of life that don't become TV melodramas?  The two boys represent two sides of the same coin in terms of their  personalities and directions in life.  The amazing part of this story is in showing the effects of abuse over time and the growing need of the characters to understand it. The obsession of it. The obsessions of the two characters, one to comprehend what happened to him and the other who has made sexual obsession the guiding aspect of his life.  That's a hard thing to do in a movie but somehow this movie and especially it's actors pull it off.  They are incredible and it doesn't matter if they represent extremes of behavior brought about by sexual abuse, (and that is debatable) there is something deeply symbolic about both of them that connects to anyone who went through similar experiences. I have doubts that a lot of people who haven't had similar experiences could fully understand this film.

  There are people who will view this movie as sympathetic to pedophiles (since it's about the obviously devastating effects of child abuse I find that hard to understand), pornographic(abuse rape, and sex are realities),titillating, sick, whatever.  But the reality is that events like this occur all the time and there is no easy way to show it in an intelligent, thoughtful movie, but this movie is subtle.  Listen to the way Neil's voice changes towards the end of the movie. There isn't really a weak actor or actress in the entire movie. The ending captures something about beginning to understand the depths of  your own life's experiences and the fact that your life can never be the same once you have.",1138060800,12,2006,4.667613636363637

However, he was amazing. Same with Michelle T. Unfortunately I got flashbacks about Mysterious Skin everytime I saw a preview for her inane ice skating movie. Talk about a variety in movie roles.

  One of the boys believes the experience was wonderful, even a wish fulfillment of sorts while the other goes into total denial..with devestating results.

  Based on a noted book, the film stands on its own although it was a rougher experience for me, more ""real"", since the visuals were so detailed, so hard to watch (at times). Joseph Gordan Levitt is stunning in his portrayal of Neil McCormack as a teen hustler, and he has a special charisma that leaps from the screen.

The other actors do a fine job as well and Michelle Tractenburg reaches new depths in her acting, although she is playing the teen she so often does, but with a harder edge...this isn't the little sister of Buffy. In Mysterious Skin, she is a perfect accomplice/friend to Neil, grounding him when he starts to get crazy, nurturing him when his tough facade wavers.

 Viewers who can't handle graphic male/male sexuality should avoid this film and even those who can may find it a tough ride at times but it never loses its integrity - or heart.

Joseph Gordon Levitt's character actually makes this movie ten times harder to watch because you really see the harshest of these realities running rampant in his character.

2394403,3,B000ATQYQU,"'Mysterious Skin' examines child abuse by looking at its aftermath. It tells two stories; one of Neil, who grew up to become a rent-boy, the other of Brian, who believes he was kidnapped by aliens when he was younger. Both were sexually abused by their baseball coach but Brian doesn't really remember it. When he hears about Neil, he feels an instant connection to him and the tow gradually discover the truth of their past.

I can't say I really cared about the Brian storyline. Neil's was more interesting, and frankly, more believeable. Neil isn't a really likable character but he is more charasmatic. He is the character who suffers the most after the abuse as he deals with his need for constant sexual expression in the form of degrading prostitution. In the moment when he is raped in the shower and finally breaks down, any slight interest I had in Brian vanished. You can just tell that Neil will have an interesting, and probably traumatic future.

This movie was almost impossible to watch in some parts because of its very real portrayel of child abuse. There were some moments when I felt like I was watching a horror movie because of the sense of impending doom I felt. I guess that this is a warning that this movie contains some rough material that will be difficult for any sane viewer to handle. Be prepared.",1135209600,4,1328,4.646808510638298
2394404,5,B000ATQYQU,"I've yet to read the book this film is based on, and I plan to.  My main commentary is on the acting, mainly that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michelle Trachtenberg.

Michelle Trachtenberg plays Wendy, best friend and soulmate ot Neil, played by Jospeh Gordon-Levitt.  I had grabbed the box recognizing Gordon-Levitt, and really dind't pay attention to the rest of the cast; the synopsis on the back caught my eye, and so I rented it.  WOW.

If you're like me, you're familiar with Joseph Gordon-Levitt from ""3rd Rock From the Sun"", and Michelle Trachtenberg from Seasons 5-7 of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".  Let's face it, neither of them developed much more than a fanboy following based on sometimes canned performances on network televsion.  Gordon-Levitt was the cute teen comic relief in his show, and Michelle Trachtenbergs' ""Dawn"" character was mostly dull, and at times downright annoying.  So imagine my surprise when I first hear Neil's voice and realize that it's Gordon-Levitt.  Imagine my shock seeing little miss priss playing a young girl doing drugs, smoking cigarettes, and helping her best friend, Neil, turn tricks!

The depth of these two alone makes the film worthwhile, especially Gordon-Levitt.  His self-loathing Neil, desperately trying to reclaim his status as ""Coach's favourite"" with older, unattractive men who remind him of Coach, is an emotionally void character with so much depth once you get past his outside.

It's painfully obvious he is trying to reclaim something special, in a warped sort of way, and some of the scenes he finds himself in when he gets to NYC are frighteningly intense.  His first trick is with a rough-and-tumble stud who demands to be penetrated by the teenage Neil, who has to be shown how to use a condom (and has obviously never topped a guy before).  His second encounter is the most intense, moreso than his third because of the impact it has.  The ever-creepy Billy Drago plays this second trick, and when he disrobes and you see the tell-tale Karposi's Sarcoma, you don't know what to think.  Even the act of giving this man a backrub was made so disturbing, it's obvious that this encounter has changed Neil in some way.  But not enough, because he does one last trick, and ends up raped by his john.  It was frightening, but it wasn't as intense as the second scene.  Not sure why though.

Trachtenberg's Wendy is there supporting Neil all the way.  where he is somewhat stuck in his childhood, she has moved on, encouraging him to find a job and playing his conscience.  She shows an edge I didn't think she possessed, to be honest.

Brady Corbett (Brian) and Mary Lynn Rajskub were also excellently cast, but by about halfway through the film when it hits you like a ton of bricks that Brian was also molested by Coach, the ""alien abduction"" storyline gets a bit old.  It's well-played, and the introduction of Eric isn't as odd to me as it was to some.  After all, Brian isn't comfortable with women, he isn't a sexual being, and being friends with Eric puts him that much closer to Neil.  That part worked out very well, at least in my opinion.

The last scene of the film, when Neil reveals to Brian what happened when they were mutually abused by Coach was one of the most disturbing and moving scenes of the film.  There was an emotional rawness to Brian; his pain was so obvious.  Neil was cold and matter-of-fact, almost as if just telling a story about a day at the part instead of a story of molestation.  IKt made the film, and took it to a whole new level.",1135209600,7,3535,4.700813008130082
2394405,4,B000ATQYQU,"Director Gregg Araki's adaptation of Scott Heim's novel about child abuse is entirely true to the novel.  In fact, having just read the novel before seeing the movie, I could predict every on-screen action, and the movie just became a vivid and larger-than-life version of the haunting elements of the novel.  Every character was true to the novel, and the plot barely diverged from the novel's action.  Would I have enjoyed this without reading the novel?  I think I might have been a little confused about all the hype, because it was the novel truly brought home the real-life impacts and emotions surrounding child sexual abuse.  Brian was a much stronger character in the novel, and came across as ridiculously innocent and confused in the movie.  Neil, on the other hand, was strengthened by his on-screen portrayal, because his conflicted emotions over his hustling behavior were really driven home by Joseph's Gordon-Levitt's acting.",1134864000,3,941,5.117647058823529
2394406,2,B000ATQYQU,"I never read Scott Heim's source novel, but regardless, I am genuinely bewildered by the praise heaped upon director-screenwriter Gregg Araki's amateurish 2005 feature about child abuse and recovered memory. Granted the overriding themes are valid and worthy of exploration, I just find Araki's approach exploitative and relentless. The plot revolves around two eight year-old boys traumatized by incidents that affected them in completely different ways. Brian is a geek who thinks he was abducted by aliens, while surly Neil has become a male prostitute in a futile attempt to recapture the intimacy he felt with his Little League coach. That the boys' parallel stories converge over the next decade becomes pretty obvious when Brian's journey takes on increasingly contrived dimensions, especially as he connects with Avalyn, an obsessive farm girl who claims to have had a similar alien encounter. However, it's Neil's journey that Araki chooses to present in disturbing detail with one scene of sexual degradation after another ending with an act of violent sodomy in a bathtub.

Obviously distancing himself from his ""Third Rock from the Sun"" character to develop some indie cred, Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays Neil with passive hostility in a hollow attempt to look cool. Brady Corbet certainly captures the awkwardness of Brian, but his unchanging naivet gets tiresome. Only in the final minutes does either actor achieve a sense of poignancy. I was amazed and somewhat saddened to see Elisabeth Shue in the role of Neil's blowsy mother, though her role is gratefully brief. Michelle Trachtenberg and Jeff Licon actually manage to elicit some sympathy for their oddball characters, though Mary Lynn Rajskub takes the cake for her portrayal of Avalyn. Other roles are acted atrociously like a snuff film, which may have been Araki's intent. It's obvious that he is trying to compensate for a weakly developed storytelling technique with scenes that are designed to provoke and shock. I have to admit that when the plot strands come together at the end, the movie improves considerably. But by that point, it is too late as I became far more numbed than moved by the conclusion.",1134604800,6,2184,5.204545454545454
2394407,3,B000ATQYQU,"""Mysterious Skin"" was adapted by director Gregg Araki from Scott Heim's novel about the aftermath of childhood sexual abuse. The story is recounted in the first person by 2 young men who shared a fateful experience as children but  have led disparate lives since then. Neil McCormick (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a hustler, a prostitute, who drinks too much, drugs too much, and is generally goal-less, though self-possessed and charismatic.  Brian Lackey (Brady Corbett) is a kind of semi-reclusive social misfit who experiences frequent blackouts and is preoccupied with discovering what happened to him during 2 episodes of ""missing time"" in his childhood, which he is inclined to attribute to alien abduction. The story begins in 1981 when Neil and Brian were 8 years old and members of the same Little League team, whose studly coach (Bill Sage) was the object of precocious Neil's childhood crush, and picks up in 1991, when the two 18-year-olds are struggling with their past and trying to  make a future.

I suppose ""Mysterious Skin"" is intended to be a character drama and a lesson in the long-term consequences of sexual abuse, which manifest themselves differently in these 2 different personalities. But I'm not buying it. The film's pace is unbearably slow, and it is emotionally flat until the end, at which point it shifts gear into melodrama. But the biggest problem is that Neil's storyline is credible while Brian's is not. Brian has repressed memories of 2 events from his childhood. But repressed memories are very rare and occur only in cases of trauma repeated many times. Brian's memory apparently disappeared after only one event. And he has psychosomatic blackouts and nosebleeds for a decade because of it. Preposterous. If someone blacks out all the time, there is a physical reason for it. Brian's psychology is pure fantasy.

And Brian's storyline is plagued by sloppiness. We see the UFO that he believes abducted him -which was not in the book- yet it's not supposed to be real. I believe director Gregg Araki is implying that another woman who claims to have been abducted by aliens, Avalyn (Mary Lynn Rajskub), was also the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of her father. But, if this is so, why did her ""missing time"" incident occur when she was in a car with her grandparents? The friendship that develops between Neil's flamboyant friend Eric (Jeff Licon) and Brian would never happen. Neil's statements at the film's conclusion come out of nowhere. They're out of character. ""Mysterious Skin""`s characters don't act organically. Their behavior doesn't follow a reasonable progression. This might have been an interesting film had it been solely about Neil. He has a strong personality, which Joseph Gordon-Levitt conveys with a certain charisma. The film's best scenes are those between the pedophile coach and clever, egotistical 8-year-old Neil. Hats off to both of these actors, Bill Sage and young Chase Ellison. But the whole Brian storyline is sloppy nonsense.

The DVD (TLA 2005): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (2 min), a ""Book Reading with Brady Corbet and Joseph Gordon-Levitt"" (1 hour), in which the actors read sections about their characters from the novel, and an audio commentary with director Gregg Araki and actors Brady Corbet and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in which they recount some filming anecdotes and Araki talks about the film's visual style, the actors, and the characters. Araki does most of the talking in the commentary. My DVD had some menu problems: I could get to the set-up menu, which contains the commentary, before viewing the film but not after.

2394410,4,B000ATQYQU,"Mysterious Skin delivers on all cylinders as a film about child abuse and the effects it has on the children who have been abused.

That is absolutely NOT what I thought this film was going to be about. It made me enjoy it all the more - though this is not a particularly enjoyable film to watch all the time.

Two young men in a small town in Kansas are unconsciously dealing with the effects of former sexual abuse a young boys at the hands of their little league coach.

Neil (absolutely played to perfection by Joseph Gordon Levitt) and Brian (played not quite as effectively by Brady Corbet)are both in their late teens. Neil was the ""favorite"" of the child molesting coach and spent almost every day of an entire summer in the coach's grasp, whereas Brian suffered only twice over several years at the coach's hands.

Neil, we know from the start, acknowledges that he felt sexual urges for other boys prior to the molestation. After the molestation, though, he burgeons into a streetwise, emotionally unavailable street hustler, who hides his profession only from his somewhat slutty, but loving mother (Elizabeth Shue).

Brian, was the worst player on the little league team. He was timid and scared of his own shadow to begin with. The molestation pushes him further into an introverted, inhibited life. Further, he doesn't remember the molestation. His life has been full of black outs, nose bleeds, and seizures, which, he is convinced, are the results of being abducted by aliens - since he has no memory of the molestation.

Neil seems to know that he is a hot item. He has no problem displaying his lithe and sinewy body for any and all men willing to pay. In his small town bar, he tells his friend Eric, that he has slept with every man in the bar. Eric, a gay young man who moved to the small town from California, finds it apalling that Neil seems only attracted to older, fatter, and unavailable men - since Eric is in love with Neil.

Neil moves to New York to join his best female friend, Wendy (Michelle Tractenberg) in the city that never sleeps. It isn't what he thought it would be.

In his little Kansas town, he was the town's only male satyr and he was completely protected from the truly kinky lifestyle of the out homosexuality that a city like New York offers. He was also fairly protected from AIDS - it just wasn't something he had to worry about. In a telling scene, in New York, one of his first tricks insists Neil use a condom. From Neil's expression, not only does he not how to put one on, but it is doubtful he's ever seen one before.

In a scene that I found terribly frightening, until I realized what was going to actually happening, Neil picks up a creepy looking trick, Zeke (played by the ever able and creepy actor Billy Drago), and is not sure he should have done so. The reality of his mistake is evident when Zeke disrobes and even naive Neil becomes aware of what his sexual promiscuity can result in: Zeke is covered with Karposi's Sarcoma lesions. Fortunately, Zeke is benevolent enough not to want Neil to actually have sex with him. It is an intense scene.

Neil and Brian don't know each other. They didn't really know each other as young boys. However, Brian is encouraged by a fellow ""alien abductee"" to find others who shared his abduction. He is convinced that Neil (though he doesn't know his name) was abducted with him.

Finally upon meeting Neil, when Neil returns to Kansas beaten and horribly battered by a New York trick gone bad, Brian learns the truth about what happened ten years earlier. This scene, too, is very poignant and painful to watch.

Mysterious Skin is a painful, but believable film. It is not joyous, but is is insightful. Having worked with abused kids before, I found this movie very very realistic in its depiction of the two dichotomies of the abused boys portrayed in this film: one a sexual deviant after his abuse; the other sexually repressed and in denial.

This is brilliant filmmaking from Greg Araki, whom I've not been impressed by in the past.

Get this film to get a dose of sad reality. Don't get it expecting to see something uplifting and joyous.",1132185600,11,4149,4.581646423751687
2394411,5,B000ATQYQU,"Succeeds on so many levels - as a work of art, as a study in fine acting, and as a true-to-life look at a scary, hidden but all-too-common aspect of the world.",1131321600,4,159,4.0
2394412,5,B000ATQYQU,"""Mysterious Skin"" concerns two young men in 1991.  One (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a gay hustler who seems headed toward self-destructive oblivion; the other (Brady Corbet) is a repressed community college student convinced that he's been abducted repeatedly by aliens.  Told largely in flashback, the story relays how these two characters were profoundly affected by their childhoods.

The acting is uniformly good.  Casting Gordon-Levitt in this role could have been gimmicky, much like Jonathon Taylor Thomas' role in the inferior ""Speedway Junky.""  However, Gordon-Levitt pulls off the role spectacularly, with a performance full of subtlety and shading.  Even though his character is off-putting and seemingly amoral, he manages to be likeable.  That the audience can sympathize with and even understand this character is a testament to Gordon-Levitt's work, as well as the terrific screenplay, adapted by the novel by Scott Heim.  Greg Araki's direction is also superb.  Many of the flashback scenes in particular required tremendous sensitivity to protect the child actors, which Araki manages with some inventive filming.  I haven't seen any of Araki's previous films, but I look forward to doing so.

The movie is very good until the final scene, which is so profoundly affecting that it elevates a solid movie to an outstanding one.  The denouement is brilliant and haunting without resorting to cheap melodrama or fake catharsis - you don't get the feeling that ""all is well.""  Again, credit has to go to Araki and the stars.  Overall, this film is a superb examination of how the past can dictate our futures.  Most highly recommended.

Extras include a somewhat awkward filmed reading by Barry Corbet and Joseph Gordon-Levitt of the first sections of the Heim novel as well as a highly informative commentary track with Araki, Corbet, and Gordon-Levitt.",1131148800,17,1864,5.310580204778157

His screen adaptation of Scott Heim's fine book is tough, insightful, balanced, challenging, and wholly successful.  Few other directors, except possibly Gus van Sant and the Stephen M. Ryder/

Michael Cuesta team ('L.I.E'), would be brave enough to make a motion picture that presents a story that includes pedophilia and there find a moving study of developing sexuality in youngsters that becomes an important and sophisticated drama.

1981, Hutchinson, Kansas.  Neil McCormick (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is 8 years old and finds fascination watching his rather loose mother Ellen (Elizabeth Shue) have sex with multiple partners.  Neil is attracted to and desires the males Ellen brings to the house. He is a hang loose guy and the star member of a Little League baseball team coached by ruggedly handsome Bill Sage.  Also on the team is a another 8-year-old, Brian Lackey (Brady Corbet,) who is from a neighboring town and is the easily distracted, bespectacled, non-athletic son of Mr and Mrs Lackey (Chris Mulkey and Lisa Long), whose sole reason for being on the team is at the demand of his macho father.

Some time lapses and Brian becomes convinced he has been abducted by aliens, the only way he can explain a loss of 5 hours of time and the presence of subsequent nosebleeds and fainting spells. In Hutchinson, Neil's attraction to his Coach results in a close friendship that just happens to evolve into sexual play, something Neil treasures as he has fallen in love with his Coach.  Neil's best friends are Wendy (Michelle Trachtenberg) in whom he confides everything, and gay Eric (Jeffrey Licon) who happens to be in love with Neil.

1991 and the two boys have matured - Neil has become a fulltime hustler, receiving pay for sex from older men cruising the park. Wendy moves to New York after gently warning Neil to always play safe in his 'occupation'.  Meanwhile Brian has grown up into a lad obsessed with outer space aliens and discovers a friend Avalyn (Mary Lynn Rajskub) through a TV show about people who claim to have been abducted by aliens. They bond much to Brian's now-single mother's concern, and Avalyn pledges to help Brian find the people who haunt his dreams about the missing five hours of his life at age 8.

Neil moves to New York and becomes a full time hustler, falling in with all manner of johns and becomes disturbed when he is confronted by an AIDS patient john followed by a sadomasochistic john.  Wendy encourages him to leave hustling and find a 'real' job.  Neil's mother lovingly sends Neil tickets to return home for Christmas and Neil departs New York for a meaningful trip home.  While Neil has been away Brian has discovered with Avalyn's help that Neil is the strange person in his nightmares, becomes friends with Eric - his connection to Neil - and Brian awaits Neil's return to Hutchinson to confront Neil and find his missing 5 hours of years past.  Aided by Eric, Neil and Brian bond and Neil agrees to reenact a significant moment when they were eight years old, a transformative time that includes the coach and the effect of the Coach on the two boys' lives.  It is a powerful moment has monumental consequences.

Araki directs this story with such grace and finesse that he makes each of the main characters not only credible but also multidimensional and loveable.  There are no good guy/bad guy polarities in Araki's vision, only a spectrum that feels as real as the air we breathe.  Every member of this large cast is superb, without exception, but the work of Joseph Gordon-Levitt anchors this film with wholly natural and brilliant acting.  The others (Brady Corbet, Michelle Trachtenberg, Elizabeth Shue, Bill Sage especially) rise to the same level.  Kudos also go to the young actors Chase Ellison and George Webster who portray Neil and Brian at the age of 8.  And the musical score unlerscores the action well.

This may not be a movie for everyone, though I wish it were as seeing this film provides deep understanding into some of the sexual spectrum too many people refuse to address.  It is a wholly successful film on every level.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, November 05",1130803200,7,4263,4.836088154269972

A great independent film with controversial subject matter, viewers should know going in that the child actors involved in the prologue scenes had no idea the true meaning of what was going on and were filmed in a way to shield them from the sordid acts being committed to celluloid.

Re: the main stars: Brady Corbet was seven years younger than Joseph Gordon-Levitt when they filmed this, yet the age difference is unnoticeable. All the supporting characters are memorable and entertaining. MYSTERIOUS SKIN is everything an Indie flick should be: interesting premise too dark for mainstream cinema; established stars slumming it in thankless roles (Elisabeth Shue) and an open-ended finale that doesnt tie everything up in a pretty bow.

In a way, this kind of reminds me of a companion piece to FUN (1994, another of my favorite Indie films) and the special attraction shared by the two young leading ladies (Alicia Witt, Renee Humphrey) in which the characters are bonded together by tragedy and circumstances.
