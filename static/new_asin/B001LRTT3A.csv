3691167,5,B001LRTT3A,"Yes, it really got to stinkin' when Rick sang along........and when the camera kept cutting to the smiles of the family as he did so.  But I still love this show and how I'm able to return to that time in my life whenever I watch it.  I always found it kind of sad when the characters of my favorite shows began getting older.  I know it's the natural progression of life, but feelings are feelings and it's hard to let go of that sometimes.  Happily, the past can be recaptured by popping in a dvd from any season I want.  As for Season 4, I liked the episode where Keith, a college man now, develops feelings for a married classmate as they work on an assignment together.  I credit David Cassidy with his ability to convincingly portray sensitivity, whereas some of the other cast sounded like they were reading their lines.  I also enjoyed the episode where twin brothers fall in love with Laurie.  The twins wore syrup-smiles for sure, but they were very nice-looking guys and I had a crush on them.  Yeah, I had a crush on Cassidy, too.  What girl didn't?  Several of the shows and songs in this series bring back those retro emotions.  They're a gift.",1444435200,,1158,4.410377358490566

3691175,5,B001LRTT3A,"Great as usual, just too bad that there fewer episodes in this the final season than in the other three seasons (22 as opposed to 24 or 25.)

3691188,5,B001LRTT3A,"I watched The Partridge Family in the 70s but have not seen it in reruns, so this DVD set took me back to my teenage years, with many episodes that I didn't remember seeing.  I still want to be like Susan Dey and still am in love with David Cassidy - but now I am also noticing the rest of the cast, the clever lines, the scenery and sets that could only have been made and used in the 70s. Shirley Jones demonstrated the patience of mothers in that day, along with the ambition to keep her family going, ""it all came together when Mom sang along.""  I love the music and I love the memories.  It's nice to be able to watch whenever I want.",1377216000,3,639,4.055555555555555

3691193,5,B001LRTT3A,"Be still my beating heart :) David Cassidy at the very height of his fame in the fourth and final season of The Partridge Family is a breathtaking sight to behold! Therein lies one VERY good reason to buy this box set and enjoy being transported back to your youth to a time when David was on every schoolgirls' lips and bedroom walls (in poster form, you understand)! Another very good reason is the fact that this TV series is so inoffensive, it's sugary sweet, and any kid of seven years upwards would still surely get a kick out of it today, no? Personally, I love a 'DVD and duvet' day on the sofa watching back to back Partridge Family episodes and having a little sing-a-long to the catchy songs which graced every episode. Oh happy days!",1369699200,2,745,4.445255474452555

3691198,5,B001LRTT3A,This season was all it was meant to be. The same silliness and laughs. The same songs. No surprises. That's why you buy it. I enjoy the fun of this show. Good viewing.,1358640000,,167,4.090909090909091

3691201,4,B001LRTT3A,"Any die-hard Patridge Family Fan, as my son and I are, have to have the fourth season to complete the library.  But, as with all sit-coms, it seems that they start messing around with the formula that works and end up with a jump the shark scenario.  In this case, the shark is a annoying singing neighbor child in the form of Ricky Segall.  At the end of every episode, he comes over to the Partridge House to sing a song.  YUCK!!!!!  Some people may find this extremely cute (the montage of the Partridges find them smiling happily and laughing) but I am not one.  He destroys the show for me and I find myself fast-forwarding over these parts.  Other than that, they are great.  Keith is in college, Reuben has a moustache, Laurie is still as socially aware as always, and Shirley is simply fabulous.  Not as good as the others because of the addition of Ricky but still great.",1327795200,,880,4.416149068322981
3691210,5,B001LRTT3A,"I have been looking for a song for a long time.  It was one sung by ""Little Ricky"" on the Partridge Family.  I was so happy to be able to get this set.  There are a few more songs I am anxious to hear. Thank you!",1319241600,,212,3.5652173913043477

3691212,1,B001LRTT3A,"Unfortunately, the 4th season was a real let-down.  Like all shows of that era (which I had forgotten about), as the writers struggled to meet deadlines, invariably one would come up with the idea of ""Let's introduce a new character"".  In this case it was a neighborhood kid, about 3 feet tall, who wants to join their band.  Two problems with that - His last name wasn't Partridge, and secondly, he had no talent.
I have seasons 2 & 3, and they were very funny, but this 4th season was just uncomfortable.",1304380800,2,506,4.478260869565218
3691213,4,B001LRTT3A,As a younger person I used to watch this show when ever it was on to see it again brings back simpler times in my life so to me this was a great investment in happiness,1304294400,,168,3.6944444444444446
3691214,2,B001LRTT3A,"I didn't grow up watching the Partridge Family (it was before my time) but have loved watching the first 3 seasons. I found season 4 to have a very different feel to it. In part due to the annoying Ricky addition, and in part to the other various changes that happened. Each of the characters had a slightly different appearance while they had remained (for the most part) consitent. The other very large change, was their home. It appeared to have gone throught a complete remodel. Changes are not a bad thing, but when all of those changes happen at once, it causes a feeling of detachment from the viewer and the show.

I will be watching seasons 1-3 over again, but will skip 4.",1297641600,4,682,4.456
3691215,5,B001LRTT3A,I have all of the Partridge Family DVD's.  I enjoyed the show when it was on TV and I liked watching it now.  I enjoy hearing the songs that were sung.,1296000000,,151,3.838709677419355

3691217,4,B001LRTT3A,"I loved the Partridge Family as a kid growing up. This was the final season and was up against the powerhouse of the era, All in the Family!!!!How could the Partridges compete! The downfall this last season was introducing the annoying kid Ricky!
Maybe keeping the show still on Friday nights may have saved it from cancellation??????",1278633600,3,334,4.87719298245614

3691219,5,B001LRTT3A,Bring back this kind of TV and maybe kids would be different! I love this show not just for David Cassidy but its entertaining. Many out there I know are not fans of this but at leaset it is good clean humour and the whole family can watch it unlike many of the shows on TV today. My twenty year old daughter loves it as much as I do. And you have to admit David Cassidy is sucha spunk. I also like the way he is with his step mother Shirley Jones I think this series made them closer. Great family viewing.,1264982400,,507,3.980392156862745

3691221,4,B001LRTT3A,"Get rid of Ricky, and it's a five-star rating.  He detracts from the shows, except MAYBE the first one, where his presence in the story is relevant.  But the rest of them are great.",1246406400,3,181,4.294117647058823

3691223,3,B001LRTT3A,enjoyable but ruined by talentless ricky segal felt sorry for the cast who had to endure him and smile. Songs by the others were enjoyable,1244764800,4,138,4.56
3691224,3,B001LRTT3A,"I have to agree with the first reviewer about Ricky Segal. He is horrible and voice is like fingernails on a blackboard. I could have stood it if it was just one time, on one episode. These numbers seem to last an eternity and as he said, the cast have these hokey smiles plastered on them all the way through. They must have cotton in their ears and are laughing because they can't hear him--yes it's that bad.

I love the show and was praying we would see all four seasons. It is a must own for fans and I understand the Ricky crucible only last half a season.",1244764800,6,562,4.155963302752293

3691227,5,B001LRTT3A,"I ordered this for my 5 year old daughter. Many of the current family 'sitcoms' really aren't geared for kids under 9. Call me unrealistic but I like the idea of my daughter having more options to be a kid. The Partridge Family allows that. A bit campy, but a lot of fun! Revisiting the music, the clothing and the simpler times makes this purchase well worth it!",1243123200,2,363,4.352941176470588

3691229,4,B001LRTT3A,"To this day, The Partridge Family is still my favorite TV shows.

AS I did when I wrote the review for the 3rd season in 2008.

WHAT THE HECK TOOK SO LONG TO RELEASE THIS?  Seasons 1 & 2 were BOTH released on DVD in 2005.  Took till 2008 for season 3 & FINALLY this last season in 2009.

It is my least favorite of the shows 4 seasons.

The bringing in of Ricky Segall.  What a mistake & a waste.  Just because the younger kids weren't as cute as they used to be because they grew up.

2 episodes in the season PART of them had to do with missing/stolen jewelry.

The show needed a kick & did NOT find it in this last season.  It had lost it's spark.  Most of the music did not work by this point.

TO this day do any of us around at this time remember exactly what the Williams brothers did for 15 minutes of fame that got them this episode based on them?

Disappointing, as with all the previous DVD releases NO EXTRAS, NOT A ONE.

Hope in the future when the 4 seasons are re released a better job, not as much time between release dated & GET SOME SORT OF EXTRAS ON THEM.",1239667200,2,1075,3.957943925233645
3691240,5,B001LRTT3A,"Viewing this family series after close to 35 years it is interesting to see the witty dialogue is still quite clever. David Cassidy is a very talented and creative performer even though he apparently felt quite stiffled doing that particular style of music. The music in this 4th series changes in nuance from earlier series and is edgier, you can see that he has definitely matured and was struggling with trying to play a teenager at 24. The producers should have moved forward with the times a little more, but it is still entertaining.
The only problem is that it is set for region 4 only and computers can only be set for one region which cannot be changed back and forth to suit different regions, could the product identify the region of play? All the other series are playable in any region.",1239408000,4,799,4.594405594405594
3691241,2,B001LRTT3A,"Even though this is not one of the better seasons of the Partridge Family, I still enjoy watching it and listening to the music that is on this dvd. I am glad to have this series on dvd and recommend it highly.

3691243,1,B001LRTT3A,I so love the Partridge Family but this final season ends each episode with the new 5 year-old character singing a song instead of a Partridge pop song. So don't get it unless you're prepared for tooth-achingly sweet songs sung by an unbelievably cute kid instead of the cheesy pop you love.,1237680000,6,291,4.615384615384615
3691244,5,B001LRTT3A,"This Fourth Season of The Partridge Family is ""OUTSTANDING""  I really enjoyed watching the tv series while I was in High School and the episodes are still has funny as they were when the series aired.

3691247,4,B001LRTT3A,"I've always LOVED the Partridge Family.  Watching season 1 thru 4 has brought back such fond memories.  Except in season 4 we have to watch that annoying ""Rickey"" kid in almost every episode, and even worse we have to listen to his annoying dumb songs!  I just ""fast-forward"" when that kid sings.....can't stand to listen to him.

3691249,5,B001LRTT3A,"I didn't see this series first time around in the seventies, though I did see some of the others. I think this is finely honed as we now know the characters so well and they have developed and after so long together they feel like a real family. Highly enjoyable and amusing.

3691261,5,B001LRTT3A,I have all of the seasons of the PF it is so great to go back and relive the teen years when your middle aged. I can remember what I was doing and memories of my boyfriend when I hear every song on the discs. This is a must for anyone who is a true David Cassidy fan and loves his music.,1235433600,,287,3.6451612903225805
3691262,4,B001LRTT3A,"The Partridge Family is from an era before cable TV, when just about everyone in school watched the same shows (and talked about them the next day).

In the current age, with the internet, tons of satellite channels (not to mention metal detectors in schools), it is so refreshing to watch shows like the Partridge Family - when a timely song by David Cassidy can make things all right in the world.

For me, the best part of the fourth season is the abundance of songs from the PF's ""Bulletin Board"" album.  10 of its 11 tracks appear during this season (only ""Where Do We Go From Here"" doesn't turn up).  ""Bulletin Board"" is a great LP and that's one big reason why I was looking forward to getting this season on DVD.

Unfortunately, season four also saw the addition of precocious little Ricky Segall as Ricky Stevens...  His appearances are shoe-horned in, and they are just as grating as you remember..!  He turns up in 10 episodes, and the only positive thing I can write about that is it's still less than half of the 22 episodes included...

As far as technical details go, the transfers look and sound great.  There are no special features, but there is one tiny thing that Sony included on this set (but not on any of the first three season sets) that surprised me due to the fact I didn't expect it - the original Screen Gems logo!  This logo used to be at the end of all the classic Screen Gems-produced shows of the era (Partridge Family, The Monkees, I Dream of Jeannie, etc.), so I was happy to see it back in action.  (The way I look at it, if you're going to relive your youth, small details like that swirling ""S"" with its eerie electronic music are just icing on the cake!)

All in all, the fourth season of the Partridge Family is well worth buying for its fun stories and great pop songs - just remember to keep your finger on the mute button when little Ricky comes a-calling...",1234656000,16,1901,4.4
3691263,5,B001LRTT3A,"Regardless what other people think Ricky Segall was the best part of the last season. He was precious. He was cute and adorable. But most of all he was very, very talented. I wish he had sung on every episode of the last season. He was only on 10 episodes. I can't figure out why he wasn't on more episodes. I usually don't want any bonus material except maybe extra episodes of other shows or cartoons, but in this case I wish they had put a bonus of Ricky singing. Where you could ""play all"" his songs.",1233964800,,504,4.206185567010309
3691264,3,B001LRTT3A,"I waited a few years for the release of seasons three and four of the Partridge Family and had completely forgotten about the introduction of Ricky Segall in final season. For some dumb reason, Screen Gems decided to add this little pain in the neck to ""perk things up"". My question is, what on earth were they thinking? For many fans of the Brady Bunch, the addition of cousin Oliver was a thorn in the side but at least his character was added near the end of the season and he never sang. From the first episode of Partridge season four, Icky Ricky is all over the place. You remember that kid who sat next to you on the airplane and wouldn't stop screaming for nine hours? Same thing. It's fine when he is simply sitting around throwing out his doinky one liners but when he launches into one of his supposed-to-be-cute-off-kilter-tone-deaf-hokey-songs, I find myself wanting to shove quick drying cement in my ears. What makes it worse is- as the kid screeches through these throwaway numbers- everyone's got a cornball smile on their face (as if?). Thank goodness for DVD remotes.

That aside, the shows look fantastic, the colors are vibrant and the songs are groovy as ever.......um, that's the Partridge tunes thank you.

UPDATE: Just finished watching the entire set and lucky for us, the little brat disappears half-way through the season. Good for us.",1233792000,63,1363,4.746835443037975
3691265,5,B001LRTT3A,"I was 12 when the Partridge Family first came out and immediately fell in love with David Cassidy!  At age 50 now, when I watch these DVDs, it just brings me back to that nostalgic time.  It allows me to remember the times when my 5 older brothers and sisters all lived in the same house, both my parents were alive, we had a dog and a bird, and I had no responsibilities other than household chores and doing my homework.  PF was just a great, wholesome show.  When Rueben Kincaid started getting more and more face time with the family, I thought it added a good boost to the show!  And as other reviewers have mentioned, it is fun now to pick out some of the stars like Farrah Fawcett, Arte Johnson, Maryann Mobley, Rob Reiner, etc.

A few years ago, I found David Cassidy's book in a bookstore for about $5.00 so naturally, I bought it.  The first thing I thought of as I thumbed through it to first check out the pictures, was that scandal that he had gone through when he had posed nude for Rolling Stone!  I will never forget my girlfriends and I going from store to store to see if we could find that issue.  We were too shy to ask the store clerk if they had it, so in the end, we never were able to obtain one!  I was in for many surprises when I sat down and read his book.  Back when you are such a young, innocent age, you obviously don't think of your idols as being anything but ""pure"", for lack of a better term.  So years later, I am all grown up and reading the things that went on not only in David's life back then, but the rest of PF cast!  I was horrified to find out that Susan Dey was suffering from anorexia and for days on end would eat nothing but carrots.  So much so, that Danny Bonaduce was quoted as saying his first sight of her in a bikini was shocking -- she was nothing but skin and bones and her skin took on a faint orangey color from her consumption of the carrots!  And of course, reading about Danny's brushes with the law and the temper on him that would always get him in trouble.  We never knew back then that Danny had come from a broken home where his father would beat him all the time.  David's telling in his book of how he tried to be the older brother and guardian to Danny was heartwarming to say the least!  He would try and shield Danny against the drugs and alcohol and fast women that were seeming to become a part of David's life as he took his singing act on the road.  I do remember seeing David in concert when I was 13 and that one of my sisters grudingly took me at my mother's insistence.  She said to her ""how quickly we forget when your older sister took YOU to see the Beatles!""  True, true!

David was also very candid in things that had happened to him back in the PF days.  How he and his long time friend, Sam Hyman, were ""guests"" of the ""plaster casters"" who were known for making plaster molds of male performer's private parts!  Or the many, many female fans who would accost him either leaving the set after a day's work on PF or leaving his house to go to work.  He was adamant in the book about wanting the reader to know that he never EVER took advantage of the very young girls and that he was in no way, shape or form a phedophile.  He said he was always courteous and gracious to these young girls but sent them on their way.  Maybe there are some people out there that would doubt this but for some reason, as I have gotten to know the grown-up David Cassidy, I tend to believe him.  There is a classiness to this guy that maybe wasn't really all there back then, but he has seemed to embrace it now. I like the man he has become.

So......I watched the show faithfully until it went off the air.  I bought each and every album and played them until there were too many skips and scratches to enjoy them (and even then I would still listen to them for a while!)  I remember being 14 and one day just quietly taking down each and every picture of David and the PF from the walls of my bedroom.  In the back of my mind, they all would stay from the many hours of enjoyment I had listening to their music and watching their show.  I guess I was growing up.  Then at 15, my mother suddenly passed away and everything changed.  I mean EVERYTHING.  My family fought and all left the house to leave just my father and I to weather this storm of great sadness and deep depression that her passing brought on.  I had no idea how to heal his broken heart and he had no idea how to heal mine.  So we stayed away from one another in that big house and dealt with our grief the way we each saw fit; he, in alcohol, and me in my PF re-runs and albums.  I had played David's album ""Cherish"" so many times that I knew each song back and forth, and when I would play it then at age 15, it made me smile for a little while and brought me back to that better place and time.  I knew from then on that things were probably not getting much better but David and the PF filled that void at the time of remembering how great my life had been back then and how young and happy I was.  I will admit that even now, I still put on the DVDs and/or the music when things are getting me down.

Wonderful memories.  Thank you all for listening.",1233187200,56,5193,4.089920948616601
3691266,5,B001LRTT3A,"I liked all of season four, what makes this show fun is that the actors, aside from David never hid the fact that they could not play music. Unlike the Monkees everyone could play and sing, the Partridges just looked like they were having fun, and the music is great. ""Walking in The Rain"" from thier ""Notebook"" album, is excellent. It also goes to prove that David Cassidy was an excellent singer. Plus looking at Susan Dey was a highlight of my day when I saw it aon television. The comedy duo and somtimes trio of Reuben, Danny and Keith is legendary. In the last episode fo the season when they are trying to to hide from the mystery writer, Reben's exchange with Shirley is great. ""Shirley can I give him one little hit""? Can't wait for Season four. Ok, fellow fans I have all theri cd's and I still listen to them. Fess up who else does as well?",1232409600,8,851,4.325

3691268,5,B001LRTT3A,"The Partridge Family finally came to an end in 1974, in their fourth and last season. The writers knew the show was coming to an end, as they introduced child actor Ricky Segall in the first episode of this fourth season. The Brady Bunch had the exact same ending, when their writers ran out of things to build a show around, they added a child actor to the show, cousin Oliver. Of course adding these cute little children did not save either of the shows, but it did keep the shows going for one more season. ABC television network also moved The Partridge Family to Saturday nights at 8:00 p.m. opposite CBS' All In The Family. All In The Family was a show that no one wanted to be up against, as it was always in the number one ratings, so this move just added to this fourth season definitely being the final of The Partridge Family.

The Partridge Family was based loosely on The Cowsills, a real life pop music family in the late 60's. The Cowsill's children were actively approached by the producers of The Partridge Family to be in the show, but the Cowsill children rejected the offer when their real life mother Barbara would not be included in the cast. The casting for The Partridge Family was then put together in the same style The Monkees were, ""created"" by the studio. Although the studio wanted professional singers and musicians used for The Partridge Family's songs, David Cassidy proved to the studio heads that he and his step-mother Shirley Jones really could sing the pop tunes. The studio did allow them to do their own singing, and the songs always made it to the pop charts, many in the top ten, propelling David Cassidy to being an instant pop idol.

In this last and fourth season the following were The Partridge Family regulars:
Shirley Partridge (mother)......Shirley Jones
Keith Partridge (son)......David Cassidy (Shirley's real life step-son)
Laurie Partridge (daughter)......Susan Dey
Danny Partridge (son)......Danny Bonaduce
Chris Partridge (son)......Brian Forster
Tracey Partridge (daughter)......Suzanne Crough
Reuben Kincaid (manager and family friend)......Dave Madden
Ricky Stevens (4 year old next door neighbor)......Ricky Segall

Plus David Cassidy and Susan Day, although playing siblings, always looked like they'd rather be somewhere else making out. with each other. euwww! And Danny and Mr Kincaid one of the best odd couple vaudeville pairings of all time. As for the music, David and Shirley could actually sing, they were supported in studio by the best session musos and engineers in the business, and more often than not they had great song material supplied by some of the best songwriter's for hire. so the albums are not bad either.",1524441600,,604,4.761904761904762

8319714,3,B001LRTT3A,"The Partridge Family is a great show for the first 3 seasons, and the music is actually of good quality (written by seasoned songwriters).  However, season 4 is nearly ruined by adding Ricky to the cast.  They make a point of fitting in a song performance by the precocious squirt in about half the episodes and the song belongs more on Sesame Street than it does on the Partridge Family.  Not only that, his song performance lasts longer than any PF performance ever does in any episode of any season and makes you want to throw tomatoes at the TV.
