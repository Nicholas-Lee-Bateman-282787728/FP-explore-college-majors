8150247,5,B000JFXBZ2,"Clinton Anderson is one of the truly great horse trainers of our times. His instruction is easy to follow and he demonstrates his ""Method"" in simple and easy to follow directions. I love his books also, but when you watch the DVD you can really see the flow of the patterns between horse and trainer. He has pearls of wisdom to share with his audience done with gentle firmness and humor. Great series!",1384646400,,402,4.52054794520548

8150251,5,B000JFXBZ2,"I like the way Clinton Anderson teaches. He makes it easy to understand and demonstrates what he's teaching while telling what he's doing and why, as well as giving tips that stay in your mind. I also like how he demonstrates with a person who's trying to teach her horse and they both are ""green"" at this, as it shows what common problems with the horse and the trainer can be and how to correct them. And then he shows the round penning exercise with his own trained horse so you can see what the results are when you follow his training. I just got a new round pen and am anxious to use what I've learned on these DVD's!",1307404800,,623,4.2
