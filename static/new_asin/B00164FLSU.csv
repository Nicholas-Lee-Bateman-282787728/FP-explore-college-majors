8260755,3,B00164FLSU,"I preface this by saying that I LOVE The Alphabet vs. The Goddess and find his premise to be strong in that book even if some of his supporting arguments are thin.

While Sex, Time and Power is an intriguing read, I find the central premise that women historically needed dead meat hunted by the primitive man to replace their iron stores to be thin at best.

An alternate theory could go more like this:  Men currently (and I'm guessing, historically) eat far more meat than women, seemingly to recharge more quickly after a greater expenditure of energy.  It is a denser form of stored energy, innately most desireable to men or women who have expended a great amount of energy in a short period of time.  Biologically, as caretakers and nurturers, women find the IDEA of eating dead animals unappealing.  Personally, I have found that eating too much meat decreases my sensitivity and energy levels.  I have found that my iron levels are not adversely affected under normal exertion by eating only vegetarian sources of iron.  The female biological tendency is to conserve energy and resources rather than expend energy, so our caloric needs are much smaller than simply the difference between a woman's weight and a man's weight.  A guess would be instead that men discovered that successfully hunting meat increased their physical power and--in a certain ways--their intelligence (reaction time, awareness, etc).  Since the male impulse to have sex was really greater than any long term desire to raise progeny, from a short-sighted perspective, becoming stronger would increase their chances of ""getting laid,"" either by coercion, force, or by displaying abilities that a woman would see as a strength and know-how that could keep her and her children safe from predators.  ""Bringing home the bacon"" was a heroic enterprise that could bring admiration from the tribe, as capturing a wild animal was not an easy task.
