8310487,1,B001I6TA88,"I have had previous instructional contact juggling videos but unfortunately they are in VHS format.

Pros:
*None. Worse than any other videos I've purchased

Cons:
*Poor instructional quality. You're better off with YouTube videos.

Not recommended. Look for alternatives.",1352851200,,272,5.923076923076923
8310488,5,B001I6TA88,"IT'S A BALL. Its exactly what it says it is. It is near indestructible, it's not a fake ball of plastic like the ""fushigi"". The only part i'm mad about is the first one my friend bought for me got lost in the mail, so he had to buy it for me again :/",1300406400,,250,3.6481481481481484
8310489,2,B001I6TA88,"I got this video in hopes that it would teach me more then the video that came with a Fushigi Ball, well even though I would tell most people to pass on a Fushigi, and get a Sil-X ball, I gotta say this DVD was a let down.. First off it's only 42 min's long, the price ain't too bad for a Tutorial DVD, but the fact that you can buy the F-ball and get a better DVD, plus a ball to practice with for a few bucks more, I hate to say it but I'd go the Fushigi route...  Like stated in other reviews, If you've never done Contact Juggling, and don't have access to Youtube then this would be a good beginner dvd for single ball tricks.. There is a Multiball section, but it's just the guy with 2 stage balls showing off for a min, and telling you to basically go figure out how to do anything with more then one ball elsewhere. He doesn't even cover double or triple Hand Spins, which was one thing I was hoping to see on the DVD.. In conclusion, I have been CJ'ing since Dec of 2010, and honestly there was nothing in this video you can't get on youtube, or if you buy a Fushigi Ball, just remember I only recommend the Fushigi as a practice acrylic, with a better tutorial dvd, as a contact ball the thing has major flaws, metal ball off center, chips, and scratches really easily etc..",1298505600,2,1284,4.095238095238095
8310490,1,B001I6TA88,"I had done my research on Contact Juggling and wanted to pick up and practice the skill. I wanted a little more in detail instruction beyond what I could find on the internet, and so I purchased this DVD. I ended up being quite disappointed with this instructional DVD. It does well in showing you the tricks and inspiring ideas, but that's about it. The actual technical instruction is VERY lacking. Some people are able to see the move in slow motion with a few comments on how it's done, and pick it up this way, but not me. There is no detailed technical instruction or conceptual tips to go on whatsoever, which are the components that I need in order to be instructed successfully.

In the end this DVD left me completely frustrated!! I feel like I paid for a DVD of a guy SHOWING but not TEACHING me Contact Juggling- therefore it does not fulfill it's purpose. I have learned more from YouTube videos. VERY disappointing!",1297036800,,929,4.529761904761905
8310491,3,B001I6TA88,"If you're new to the concept of contact juggling, this product gets the job done.  It provides good basics and shows many cool tricks and trick ideas.  However, the technical instruction is sometimes inadequate.  Some people do well with seeing a trick and simply working to emulate it, but I much prefer when a trick is explained in thorough detail as it is demonstrated so that I can have conceptual tips to go on.  In other words, the video does a nice job of showing tricks but not as good a job explaining how to learn them.  Admittedly I was not a total beginner when I purchased this product, so I may be a little harsh, but I own MagicGeek's Ultimate Diabolo, and it does a fantastic job in every department.  In comparison, this product was slightly disappointing.",1294963200,,773,4.565217391304348
8310492,5,B001I6TA88,"this is actually a great instructional dvd for contact juggling. there's not a whole lot i can say about the dvd that isn't written in the product description. It includes great informative instruction, slow motion, diagrams, and some punk music. plus the guy is easy on the eyes with a nice voice- that may sound like a stupid point.. but come on... do you really want to be looking at an ugly guy who can't enunciate for 42 minutes?
