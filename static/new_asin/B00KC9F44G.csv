8657522,3,B00KC9F44G,"After Office Hours is a typically well-made trifle from MGMs glory days in the Thirties that coasts on star power without threatening to stay in the memory. Clark Gable is the standard issue fast talking newspaper editor who thinks that a newspaper should print any news that can be found or bought who fires Constance Bennetts society girl from the reviews page but has to woo her back onto the staff when he discovers shes an old friend of the key players in a society divorce scandal hes desperate to get the scoop on  especially when it turns into a murder. Gable may surprisingly be second billed but he gets the better character even if it is a clichd one, the writers not able to flesh Bennett out beyond the odd society reference and standard issue battle of the sexes banter with the odd bit of tongue-in-cheek class warfare thrown in: you certainly get the feeling that MGM wanted to catch some of It Happened One Nights magic with another tale of a streetwise newspaperman and a society heiress, but didn't really know how and certainly didn't want to take them out of the drawing room. The dialogue rarely sparkles but the stars play it as if it did and at times do it so well that they almost convince you theyve got better material than they do. Henry Travers and Stuart Erwin don't really have enough to do as Gables sidekicks (nor does William Demarest's cop on the case) while Billie Burkes on hand to do her usual shtick as Bennetts naturally pixelated and well lubricated mother and you can even spot an unbilled Margaret Dumont as a guest at a society party.

Warner Archive's DVD-R offers a decent transfer with the original trailer as an extra.",1454630400,4,1666,4.587248322147651
8657523,4,B00KC9F44G,"The biting wit of Herman Manckiewicz's dialogue got good reviews from movie critics for this comedy in which Clark Gable is a newspaper editor and Constance Bennett as his reporter. Harvey Stephens plays the unsuspected murderer in this juiciest crime story. In supporting role are Billie Burke, Katherine Alexander and Stuart Erwin. This is well directed by Robert Leonard and produced by Bernard Hyman.",1439942400,2,404,5.328125
