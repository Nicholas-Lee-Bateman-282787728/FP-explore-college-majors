8714586,3,B00WY8ISIC,"A really trashy, low budget, German remake of an Italian gore classic. This movie has some of the ugliest actors I've ever seen in any movie, including the director himself, Andreas Schnaas, playing the part of the Anthropophagous. Pretty decent gore scenes, with really ugly actors including some dork with a mullet. Andreas Schnaas is a German trash titan, a German garbage man.",1523318400,,380,5.0476190476190474

8714588,5,B00WY8ISIC,"Great re release uncut must have for all fans would love to see a total remaster but looks very good.  And is un cut if u have the cut version of man eater a def. Up grade.  If u have the original red edition nothing new and that is better quality.  But wanted an extra copy its still not English dub.  If Andrea's people would get smart and re release all world wide.  In a dubbed and sub title totally remastered quality upgrade that would rule.  But if u don't have original like most grab it. It's a killer flick if u hate subs.  Just play music great flick.  Andreas please re release all hd re masters V.S. 1-4 ,UNCUT ,NIKOS ,DELIRIUM,ATHRO.2000 ALL OF THEM DAMMIT.",1438041600,3,671,4.26984126984127
8714589,5,B00WY8ISIC,"Exactly what I expected!  If you're familiar with this German filmmaker's other work, like Zombie Doom or Zombie '90, you might dig this.  This is almost a literal re-play of Joe D'Amato's Anthropophagous, on cheap German filmmaking crack.  So if you can imagine a head-on collision of Joe D'Amato and Schnaus, and you want this to happen, then you'll enjoy yourself.  Not high art, and not supposed to be.  Had hoped for more extras.  Kind of lacking on this DVD.  Still a good release, though.",1435968000,8,495,4.752941176470588
