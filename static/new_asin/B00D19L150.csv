Great insights into his character from the interviews with fellow composers, musicians and friends who knew, loved and worked with him. A must for any Delerue fan. Very few of his fine period scores are mentioned, however.",1457222400,,348,4.8

What a wonderful release In The Tracks Of - greatest film composers series in our film music world! Pascale Cuenot of Prelight in France did a fantastic job and her effort in making it happen is highly admired and appreciated.

It's very ironically that France leads the way instead and exhibits artistic value in outlining film composers' different perspectives in approaching film score during pre & post scenarios. Making this kind of documentary is very challenging and tough. It's not an easy task at all as it involves tremendous time with rights during the process particular the composer is no longer with us.

Mozart of Cinema Georges Delerue (1925-1992) was 1 of the 3 composers under the series including Gabriel Yared and Maurice Jarre (1924-2009). We love to see more release in the near future. In fact, the other documentary of Georges Delerue - Music for the Movies (Total 59 mins) was firstly available in 1994 which directed by Louis Comolli who addressed films like Women In Love (1969), Two English Girls (1971), Le Mepris / Contempt (1963), Shoot The Piano Player (1960), Salvador (1986), The Story of Adele H (1975) and A Walk With Love & Death (1969), etc., but technology-wise (ie: sound with music editing, color illustration & photography, etc.) is less exciting.

In the Tracks Of Georges Delerue is a collector item for anyone who loves film score and French New Wave (active era 1958 -1964) movies especially to the great director Francois Truffaut (1932-1984), Philippe de Broca (1933-2004), Jean Luc Godard and Agnes Varda. This wonderful DVD tells us the composer how to approach mingle and fulfill directors' expectation via his unique way and vice versa how directors, music professionals and record producers demand or look at the musician through their individual interviews (Bonus 94 mins). In addition to this montage of composer, his graceful music never and ever over react in the movie in which make you feel warm and add a strong feeling of sentimental - romance & sadness.

This excellent DVD (Total 192 mins / D9-7.35G) value for money and provided quite a number of rare photos & clips included part of BBC documentary ""Don't Shoot The Composer"" filmed by legendary director Ken Russell (1927-2011) in 1966. How many film composers have such privilege? DVD also included a very decent booklet (16 pages) featured both French & English liner notes together attractive narration by Truffaut's companion French actress Fanny Ardant plus unreleased recording session (26 mins) - Premier Quatuor a Cordes No1 (1948) / movement by le Traffic Quintet.

It's ironically Oliver Stone appeared in both documentaries Music for the Movies and In The Tracks Of although they collaborated in Salvador and Platoon in 1986. During this interview, Stone apologized that he abandoned Delerue's original score in Platoon. Stone obsessed and killed the talent of Delerue by replacing Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings in which used before for numerous times in other movies! Perhaps it was one of Stone's mistakes or stains in his film career!?

In addition to other rejected score Regarding Henry (1991) directed by Mike Nichols, it'll be more consummated if it included interview with Nichols and we could know more background story of this unfortunate incident for both Nichols & Delerue because they had good collaboration in The Day of The Dolphin (1973), Silkwood (1983) and Biloxi Blues (1988).

Popularity-wise, it's very interesting to tell Delerue is less awareness than others - Continental Stylist Vs Hollywood Craftsman. Maybe it's all about Delerue's humble blood and his conservative Agents which do not know how to marketing or promote his unique music over the decades! Admittedly, most of his outputs do not much involve ""commercial movies"" but Delerue's a ""truly international"" musician who could work with many great directors in his career, able to compose, orchestrate and conduct his music.

I feel sad & happy every time when I watch this gorgeous documentary. Sad because I'll never be able to meet Georges again and enjoy his new music anymore. Happy because I had very good fortuned with honor come across with this rare French master & his wife Colette in 1990. ""You don't have to seek friendship with Georges because he would offer it to you first"" - I truly experienced as a film music fan!

It's glad to see our film music world and more record producers aware Mozart of Cinema Georges Delerue who's the first or perhaps the only one marked the history in gaining ""3 consecutive"" Cesar Awards in 1979/80/81 together 1979 Academy. Talented Pascale Cuenot breakthroughs the block in presenting this wonderful documentary series to salute our unsung hero should be credited.

To appreciate film score and introduce the music of Georges Delerue is one of my hobbies. Delerue's a giant among giants in film industry. Hopefully this wonderful Series could be shared not only in the film music world but also in all major universities or public libraries.
