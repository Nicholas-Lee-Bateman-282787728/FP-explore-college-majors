5994064,5,B00FJX96U8,"If you like La Corda d'Oro: Primo Passo, you will love Uta No Prince Sama 1000%: Season! This anime is based on a video game series only released in Japan. Yet, the anime has a great storyline, well-rounded characters, hilarious moments and a dash a drama. This isn't your typically high school musical as the main character, Haruka, a hard-working, kind, naive girl, enters into Saotome Academy for the Performing Art to become a composer so she can achieve her dream of writing songs for her favorite singer, HAYATO. Along the way, she meets six handsome male singers, a crazy staff and a black cat, as she works to make her dreams come true.

PROS:

If you like musicals and romance you love this series as every episode has one character or another singing a song, confessing unsaid feelings for the naive character, Harkura.

If you like slice -of -life anime this series is also for you as it looks into each of lives of the main male characters and how Haruka helps them along the way.

If you like amine where six guys all fall in love with the main female character and you the viewer like to try to figure out who she will end up with or who you hope she will end up with.

CONS:
 If you hate musical anime, this series is not for you.

If you had subtitle anime, this series is not for you.

If you hate slice-of- life anime, again this series is not for you.

If you do not like mushy, romantic or feel good anime, this series is not for you.

If you want to find a  magical violin or fairy in this series you will be disappointed.

I, for one, really enjoy this series and I hope the company who produces the series will bring out season 2 of Uta Prince Sama!",1390780800,,1672,4.306709265175719
5994065,5,B00FJX96U8,"If you like anime with music, or reverse harem anime, you'll love this anime.

What can you expect from this anime? Many emotions, and music that just might stick with you forever. Haruka dreams of writing music, and the boys that surround themselves around her, want to sing music. This is a story about their school life to becoming idols and the crazy things they have to do for their principal.

The character development and story backgrounds are well done, and the music is well composed.

Before Uta no Prince-sama came out, I never had any music I enjoyed listening to every day, and this anime brought me that.

This anime is not for everyone, but for me it was and is one of the best. It makes you feel all sorts of emotions in a slice of life sort of way.",1389225600,,766,4.373239436619718
5994066,5,B00FJX96U8,"If you like Japanese music and bishounen as much as I do, then this anime is definitely for you!

I have seen both seasons already and I love it. It contains humor, catchy tunes, amazing dance moves, and a sweet touch of character development. Haruka (the main character) is trying to find her own path through music with the help of her idol friends. In doing so, she composes beautiful notes while earning a special place in the hearts of those she composed the music for. The second season is like this one, except with a few new faces of course. Just watch it and be amazed my friends. ;)",1384992000,3,592,4.381818181818182
5994067,3,B00FJX96U8,"Uta No Prince Sama is a cute, funny, and endearing animation. It's about a girl who dreams of being a songwriter and several guys who want to become pop stars. They support and work together to make their dreams come true. However, the songs are quite cheesy as well as the facial expressions when the guys are singing. Which made it a little difficult to watch. It's worth watching at least once though.

The second season adds another character to the pop group and some magic too. The show is still funny and cheesy in the second season. But if you like the first season, you'll like the second too.",1384646400,,602,4.472727272727273
5994068,5,B00FJX96U8,"I don't write these too often, but I just felt like I had to sing the praises of this amazing reverse harem anime. I also don't usually like English subtitles, because yes, I'm kind of lazy and also makes my head hurt to read words and follow along with the scenes at the same time. But I really, really enjoyed this and can't thing of anything but positive things to say. I'm familiar enough with some themes of J-Pop culture to where the seriousness and importance of idols in Japanese culture (what they call their pop stars), makes sense to me. I'm not a huge fan of J-pop tunes that listens to them all the time, but these songs were catchy and even dare I say, moving. The idea of a school just for rising idols and composers isn't at all unbelievable for that reason. I enjoyed the wide cast of characters personalities, and how they each find their hope after the herioine, Nanami Haruka, shows them the magic of music with her exceptional song-writing. The comedy and romance parried with the occasional dramatic twist was well-balanced. There was never a dull moment and I'm sad it wasn't longer. So if you're like me and were hesitant to jump in....don't be shy and take the plunge! You won't regret it!",1435190400,3,1214,4.5227272727272725
5994069,3,B00FJX96U8,"I love the anime, it claims to be the ""Complete Collection"" but it's missing the Christmas episode, and the DVDs aren't Dubbed and it's Sentai Filmworks, so it's a slim chance that it will ever be dubbed :(",1433376000,,206,4.447368421052632

5994075,5,B00FJX96U8,"I'm so glad I could get this! This series makes me so happy because of how super cheesy it is. xD And the songs are so catchy.

I have to say that I really liked the whole packaging design for this. The DVD menu designs really fitted the anime and having the ending theme in the background got me really excited to re-watch the episodes again.",1408233600,,343,4.196969696969697
5994076,5,B00FJX96U8,"First, I wish there was a Dvd/Bluray combo.

I am not a harem fan, or a reverse harem fan. So obviously I was shocked at how much I loved this. Haruka enrolls at a school for becoming an idol, and she writes songs. Haruka is....well, special. The first thing you will notice is her glaring headlight eyes. Other than that, she's your typical kind, cute girl but unlike most harem protagonists, she has enough of a personality to distinguish her from cardboard.

The men are what makes this show. Or rather, the relationships they have with Haruka and each other (in a friendship way) and how they change. There's your obvious ""choice"" the anime tends to highlight, but he surprisingly didn't play too much of a role. I marathoned this and Season 2, so I can tell you right now that Tokiya starts off as your bland obvious final choice, but later becomes more than that.

Oh, did I forget to mention that the students are FORBIDDEN TO LOVE? Hahaha, cheesy, but it WORKS. No kissing...yeah, it's so difficult not to want Haruka and one of these eligible man-candies to kiss. In harems we see kissing so much that it gets repetitive. Now that we are forbidden to have that here, it's rather exciting. You see how they feel about each other better than if they kissed.

In the end, it is a show for the girls and women who are tired of the fanservice the men get. We get lots of sexy men. LOTS. And a story, and laughs, and dokidoki and nosebleed inducing moments. A guilty pleasure anime that just might surprise you:) You naughty you, you know you want this show.",1407628800,3,1561,4.485915492957746

I borrowed it and I can't wait to purchase mine on my next paycheck! It was so cute, I loved the colors and the music, the storyline was cute too. I really hope they decide to bring it out in English in the future. I highly recommend this show!",1402272000,,403,3.9876543209876543

I do hope season two will come out soon, I've heard that they are indeed making a season three so I also hope that they hook her up with one of those boys at the end. I hate open endings in anime. The animation is nice by the way the songs are good and the characters are very lovable and yeah I like the main character she does have more character then the nameless block of wood from Amnesia.",1401062400,,499,3.9019607843137254

5994087,5,B00FJX96U8,"Uta no Prince-Sama or ""UtaPri"" as its called by the fans and referred to at some points in the actual series is an Anime that anyone can watch and truly enjoy.  Why?  Well there's a number of reasons so what's say that we get into them.

First off the Animation:

The animation was done by a studio called ""A-1 Pictures"" whom did the animation for ""Black Butler"" ,""Blue Exorcist"" ,""Sword Art Online"" of course this series.  There are plenty of other series' that they have done the animation for but those are jut some of them and yes I will be reviewing both seasons of Black Butler that are currently available.

The animation in this season (and the season after) is honestly some of the best that I have seen in a good many years.  I've been watching Anime since Sailor Moon in 1997 and I kept wondering what it would look like years later.  Well this studio along with ""Studio DEEN"" have definitely ramped up the attention to detail that much is for sure and it definitely raises the bar for me as to what I expect to see in my Animes for years to come.

Now let's get on with the story:

The story starts based around Haruka Nanami whom dreams of one day becoming a top composer in Japan.  To accomplish this she ends trying to get into the Saotome Academy along with her friend Tomochika (we'll be calling her ""Tomo"" for the rest of this review) but you see she appeared to be late for the exam and wouldn't be allowed to get into the school to take the entrance exam!

Enter Ittoki Otoya and Ren Jinguji with the former appearing at the gate to try and help her get into the school to take the test and the latter entering by Limo explaining the reason WHY she was late in the first place.  Despite this the security wouldn't allow her in until one phone call took care of that and the rest as they say...is history!

The story through these 13 episodes takes the viewer on a roller coaster of emotions both with the highs and lows that make this season (and series as a whole) special.  There is enough comedy watching this series as the students she encounters have to resist asking her out because the school has a strict ""No Love"" policy which makes some of the interactions that happen throughout quite amusing to watch.  As a viewer you feel bad because you KNOW that the students she meets want to date her but they can't due to the rule in place there.

Oh but its also not without the typical story at the start when students believe she only got in because of ""favors"" or whatnot.  This story quickly gets dropped however within the first three episodes while we find out that Haruka can play the piano somewhat but reading the actually music...not so much (this is the cause of the talk from the other students)

You also find out that one of the students in the school is secretly leading a double life.  When I saw this story my first thought was Endo Kazuki from Gakuen Heaven (one of my first reviews on this site actually) when he lead the double life of student and Chairman.  In THIS case it has to do with a student going to school learning to BE an Idol when they already ARE one (and also became the motivation for Haruka to even WANT to go to Saotome in the first place).

The way the story builds up is that the first few episodes are used to introduce each character separately with some kind of pairing or ""issue"".  You got Ittoki and Ichinose ,Masato and Ren and Syo and Natsuki (although Nats houses a ""third"" person that you do NOT want to meet!) and each of the episodes essentially helps you learn about each of the characters and the fact that they have one singular motivation to have Haruka write songs for them.

As with any Anime you need solid characters and this series has them as I have mentioned throughout so far.  From Otoya to Tokiya everyone of them is very much a likable character while you have to try and get used to Saotome and Ringo....the less I say about him the better off I am.

The music is also a joy to listen to especially the OP (""Orpheus"") and the ED for this season (""Maji Love 1000%"") as those songs make you want to watch the next episode.  That sounds weird to say but sometimes after the song plays from a series I kind of just want to stop watching for a little while (and yes that's happened to me in the past).

Want to know the BEST song in the season?  ""Mirai Chizu""!

Why?

I'm not telling :-p

Seriously the reason that song became a favorite of mine you have to see the episode it comes in because its one of those moments that if you were kind of ""meh"" on the series before the final episode of Series 1 then you are in for a treat come the end of it I promise

If you aren't watching Uta no Prince-Sama then I actually feel bad for you because its one of those Animes that NEEDS to be watched and appreciated as one of the best out there at this point in time!

take care",1392508800,9,4854,4.28039430449069

The artwork for the characters and the songs were in perfect sync with their personalities and feelings. I love English dubbed like other people but shows like this is what makes you feel as if you can be a part of these worlds and its very moving. The Japanese voice actors are very talented and you don't have to speak Japanese to realize it. The story revolves around a girl, Haruka, whose dream is to become a composer and write songs for her music idol, Hayato. However, along the way she befriends a group of  people which she comes to live in her own way and writes songs for them and encourages them to be themselves and never give up on their dreams. I think this show is perfect for all anime lovers. It's mixed with romance, friendship, and dreams that never die.",1454803200,,858,4.39622641509434
