8453082,4,B0051QS1O0,"Forensic Files is an American documentary-style series which reveals how forensic science is used to solve violent crimes, mysterious accidents, and even outbreaks of illness. The show takes a ""whodunit"" approach, making each case a mystery to be solved. Every 22 minutes episode follows one case from initial investigation until conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or sometimes even the suspects themselves are all interviewed about their roles.

This set is about cases of poisoning. All 12 investigations are very interesting. Here are the 12 episodes you'll find on this set:

1. Bad Medicine: The story of Anthony Pignataro, a plastic surgeon who became a TV celebrity as the creator of snap-on hairpieces, who poisoned his wife with arsenic, leaving her with reduced feeling and mobility in her limbs.
2. A Bitter Pill to Swallow: The story of firefighter Michelle Baker is related. After meeting ""Mr. Right,"" she became pregnant by him - and ill whenever they were together. The coincidences led her to suspect that he was doing her harm, so she set out to prove it.
3. Cold Hearted: This episode talks about the case of Randy Thompson an ex fire-fighter. Thompson had several health problems, and later he developed a stomach virus. Lynn, his wife, helped him, but Randy later died. However, suspicions grow when it's uncovered that Randy had a life insurance of which Lynn was eager to collect. The reports show that antifreeze was used as a poison.
4. Dessert Served Cold: The Richard Alfredo Case. When a Massachusetts man dropped dead of an apparent heart attack, no one thought foul play was a possibility until police looked into his girlfriend's odd behavior in the days before his death.
5. Freeze Framed: A man suffered a slow, agonizing death over a period of days. His wife maintained he killed himself but police were skeptical... especially when they learned her first husband died when he was only 38-years-old and she refused to consent to an autopsy.
6. Hair Line: Doctors don't know why a young scientist is gravely ill. When tests finally reveal the cause, it's too late to save him. Police hope that lab analysis of his hair, showing when attempts were made on his life and what was used, will lead to the killer.
7. The Metal Business: The story of Phillip Rouss is related. In 1997, the 60-year-old Tennessee resident seemed to be dying and doctors couldn't pinpoint why. In time, however, Rouss came to believe that his partner in a car restoration business might be poisoning him and took his suspicions to the police.
8. Political Thriller: Kathy Augustine was a top elected official in Nevada. During a political campaign, she suddenly fell ill and died. Her husband then attempted suicide, and blamed her political opponents for her death. Two quick thinking nurses preserved evidence that later foiled a murderer's clever plan.
9. Sunday's Wake: When a college co-ed disappeared without a trace more than a decade ago, the case remained unsolved. But when new scientific testing became available, a man who had been a suspect all along was cast in a different light.
10. Water Hazard: Police investigate the murder of a man who died through ingesting cyanide. They find a clue in a mailing envelope which leads them to a dangerous killer.
11. Without a Trace: The puzzling deaths of two dinner guests in Nebraska in 1978 which confounded police until they realised both victims had consumed lemonade laced with poison - the discovery of which led them to an embittered killer.
12. Writer's Block: A brilliant young architect became ill and died just before she was to testify in a criminal trial.",1352160000,8,3776,5.011146496815287
8453083,5,B0051QS1O0,"A very interesting series that deals with the subject of poison, and tells of victims who did live through this very painful experince, and of others who did not. The poison may be given to them by a family member, and in small doses over many months, causeing permanent damage to vital body organs. These people would go to the doctor when they were feeling ill., their doctors weren't looking for poison in their system, that was the last thing from their mind. One woman Poisoned both her husbands.  Another woman tried to poison her daughter. A husband poisoned his wife, as he was in love with another woman, but didn't want to go through a messy divoice.  A man tryed to kill his business partner through poison. They used Arsenic and Mercury, to get rid of the people who they consider were a nuisance to them.  Arsenic leaves the body after a time.  But it's interesting to note, that it remains in the strands of hair  FOREVER.  This is how they are able to detect that a person has been poisoned. Death by arsenic is the most painful death imaginable. You will see a few who eventully did recover from lt, but are now living in a useless body.....How evil some people can be !!!",1347062400,3,1188,4.476851851851852
