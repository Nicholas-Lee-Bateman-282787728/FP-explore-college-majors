8230971,4,B000Y4ON6O,It's the man with the light-bulb head. Hitchcock fans know they must own this.,1473120000,,78,4.642857142857143
8230972,5,B000Y4ON6O,"Note to other reviewers here:
I have been a Hitchcock fan since before any of the REM gang came on board. It is
his songwriting that is the star of his music not(!) REM even though I love Buck's
guitar work. Hitchcock is one of the most under-appreciated songwriters (along with
Richard Thompson and David Olney) who has given us 3 1/2 decades of great
music that is still in ascent--while most artists that gained traction in the early 80s
are either selling used cars or still singing the same songs. He has outlasted REM
and is a more interesting songwriter than Stipe & co. ever were (even though I
am an REM fan). This DVD is a chronicle of HITCHCOCK (and good company) recording,
playing,  touring and yes ""hamming it up"" for the camera as only Robyn can do. He
trips out on words and puts them in mostly Surreal--Psychedelic/Folk/Rock musical idioms, He plays
these songs perfectly well solo sometimes as he is also a very adept guitarist. He is generous
in crediting his musicians, but with or without ""3/5ths"" of REM it is HIS work that is the main attraction.
He is also an interesting painter which is probably why his songs are so ""image oriented""
 These other reviews are an insult to a great artist.",1403654400,4,1213,4.559633027522936
8230973,4,B000Y4ON6O,"This is a nice glimpse at how the album was put together.  If you are an REM fan, you get to see 3/5ths of the band here.

This originally aired on Showtime, but this is a nice crisp digital transfer.

The live show was filmed at Maxwell's in Hoboken, NJ.  I was there, in 2006.",1219708800,2,278,4.0
8230974,4,B000Y4ON6O,"Most REM fans are blissfully unaware of the fact REM's guitar player, Peter Buck, has been playing with Robyn Hitchcock for more than 20 years.

Hithchock, for his part, has opened for, and played with, REM for a long time as well.

In this great documentary, Hitchock muses that Buck has sold millions of albums with REM, yet seems just as happy, if not more so, playing to a crowd of 75 people as he does to one of 100,000.

Peter Buck himself confirms that he much more prefers being in a ""small"" band than putting up with all the BS that comes with the territory of being a member of one of the biggest rock bands on the planet.

In the film, Hithcock invites the viewer and listener into his house in London, and gives fans an intimate and rare glimpse into his creative process.

Hitchock is truly one of the greatest living songwriters.  But don't take my word for it. Peter Buck of REM, the legendary Nick Lowe, and John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame are in the band and documentary to tell you themselves.

The only reason I didn't give the film 5 stars is that at least to me, Hithcock comes across a little bit self absorbed or ""hamming it up"" at times.

Other than this very small complaint, this is a highly recommended film for Hitchcock and John Lennon fans.",1210291200,14,1275,4.372881355932203
