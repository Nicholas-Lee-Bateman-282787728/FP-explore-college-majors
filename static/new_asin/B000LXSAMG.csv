2717365,4,B000LXSAMG,"So I ordered this film in the hopes of being able to see and compare SK and SRK  acting/dancing/character development in the early stages.  So far, I have not been a fan of SRK and after this movie I still am not. I can see why SK was nominated for awards for his portrayal as Karan. When put side by side - I think it's apparent that SK has "" it-ness.""  Clearly SK is a better dancer and projects believe-ability in this and other roles. Aside from the quality of the copy which wasn't that great the movie itself was enjoyable. The plot and the theme worked well; the music was adequate nothing that you would hum later - but the dance sequences were fun. Other reviewers have mentioned the violence - there is a lot of fighting - but the sequences are laughable.  I found myself laughing more at the the continuity issues of the fight scenes than the scenes themselves.  There is sword play - but in the context of all the fight scenes they are not done that well.  The "" western "" attire in the film was right out of  "" Saturday Night Fever "" which - was on target for the time of the film... For me the best part of the movie were the villagers.  Loved them - they were supportive, caring, and involved in cleaning up the mess and bringing retribution to the "" Landlord "".  I was a bit uneasy about the Mother/Sons relationship in the beginning of the movie - it almost seemed  "" oedipus-like"" - but as the movie proceeded it explained the mother's intensity and faith and her request to Kali to have her sons re-born and brought back to her.  Ok , that whole scene was kinda cheesy - but it worked.  So, if you're looking to add to your Hindi movie archive and you're a fan of SK and/or SRK - this movie will do.  I've given it a 4 because SK was in it or it would have been a 3.",1360972800,,1785,4.139130434782609
2717366,5,B000LXSAMG,Can't get any better than a full length movie starring SK and SRK together! Great story line well played. Puri was the vision of the devil himself as the murderous money-hungry bad guy. I have watched it several times and look forward to another viewing this evening!  Used to watch it on you tube with no subs and now enjoy fully understanding what was being said on my big screen! It's that good of a movie!,1360713600,3,409,4.381578947368421
2717367,2,B000LXSAMG,"This movie is way over the top with unneccessary violence(done terribly by the way),
and such awful acting by ShahRukh Khan too! His problem was over acting in every bit of the movie, he should learn that less is more sometimes but I think it's inherent in his style of acting. Kajol wasn't too bad except that someone should have told her to lose that mono-brow of hers before filming! The saving grace of this movie was the story line and some dignified and believable acting from the mother, the bad uncle and Salman Khan, thus the 2 star rating. Will I watch it again? Nah, unless it's to perversely amuse oneself by watching what bad acting is all about!",1319587200,2,659,4.5
2717368,1,B000LXSAMG,"I usually love Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, but this was a terrible movie. I thought Salman fared better in it than Shah Rukh did. I really liked the two female costars, one of which was Kajol and I don't know the other one's name, but she was Salman's romantic interest. To me, she was the star of the show--what an incredible dancer! This movie is full of violence and blood. In almost every scene with the boys' mother, she was being beaten up and I got used to seeing her with blood on her head all the time. Even children were being beaten and killed. The only good thing in this movie was the dancing--that was it. The dancing was very traditional and very entertaining. But the movie itself? Awful, awful, awful. I give this movie one star for the dancing only.",1283644800,3,771,4.361111111111111
2717369,5,B000LXSAMG,"I love the scenes in the Kali temple;  The sorrows endured by the mother and sons demonstrate a love and beliefs that grief can transform and manifest healing to broken hearts.  Will watch again.

Only minor fault - the subtitles do not always come across on the screen.  This would make the movie a lot more enjoyable if you can understand fully what is been discussed; however, it does  not take any of the enjoyment away from the movie's plot.

Loved it!!!!",1280793600,5,460,4.548780487804878
2717370,5,B000LXSAMG,"very good script...  one of the best of salman... im not big fan of SRK, due to his acting style(he is same all the time, ka ka ka ka ka kiran...) sorry SRK, this movie belongs to salman...",1240876800,3,189,3.973684210526316
2717371,5,B000LXSAMG,"I liked this film veyr much, although some scenes were violent and unnecessary. The actors have played their parts superbly, especially the acress playing the Mother's role. SRK is fantastic, as usual and plays any roles with great ease. The dance sequences were great! I would have liked a slightly different ending.",1203292800,3,317,5.115384615384615
2717372,4,B000LXSAMG,"Note: Hindi with English subtitles.

'Karan Arjun' released in '95 is a wonderfully entertaining 151 minute mixture of action, comedy and romance starring a cast of some of India's biggest stars; Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan (not related), Amrish Puri, Kajol and Rakhee Gulzer. This is by no means a big budget Bollywood production so some of the action scenes are shall we say a little cheezy, but the acting is excellent and you'll soon find yourself so absorbed in the storyline that you won't notice the shortcomings.

Synopsis: The film begins with the brutal murder of two brothers, Karan (Salman) and Arjun (Shah Rukh) by their dispicable Uncle Thakur (Puri) who desires the family fortune for himself. After their deaths their Mother Durga (Rakhee Gulzar) pleads to the Goddess Kali to return her sons to her alive and well. Kali answers her prayer through the vehicle of reincarnation and when the two reborn brothers return to the village twenty years later revenge is not far behind.

'Karan Arjun' offers great entertainment, high caliber cast, intriquing plot and a fascinating look at the most feared and misunderstood deity in the Hindu pantheon, Kali.",1182124800,2,1166,5.0310880829015545

8165124,1,B000LXSAMG,"The video quality was extremely BAD. I do not recommend other people to buy this video in such poor, horrible quality.
I had plans to buy other videos, since I like Indian movies a lot, but based on the horrible quality video I decided not to, since I am afraid of getting same BAD quality.",1501804800,,290,4.290909090909091
8165125,4,B000LXSAMG,"Durga Singh (Raakhee) has two sons, Karan (Salman Khan) and Arjun (Shah Rukh Khan) that are the joy of her life.  When they are murdered, she prays to Kali to reincarnate them, and restore them too her, so that they can take vengeance on her enemy.

This is both a poignant story of a mother's love and faith, and an action packed tale of revenge.  The music and choreography are average, but the costumes are spectacular.  The fight scenes are well staged and exciting.  The supporting cast is quite good.  Khan and Khan are both great in their roles, and it is fun to see the superstars act together.  (Though, in my opinion, seeing them together shows that Salman Khan is a superior fighter, dancer, and actor.)  It's a solid movie overall, and will please fans of either Khan.",1501113600,,780,4.561151079136691

8165130,5,B000LXSAMG,"I Really enjoyed this movie and happy to have bought it. One of Shah Rukh Khan's better early films. He is a very good actor and a pleasure to watch. Great dancer and performer too. I find it hard to believe he does not consider himself a good dancer. HE IS AN AMAZING DANCER! He has so much energy and you can see if loves to act and dance. Salmon was good too. I loved the music. Had to put up with watching the evil mean spirited people around Arjun, Karan and mother. If I lived in a town with people like some of those characters I would leave town if I could not kill them. People without a conscious (like my ex).",1382400000,,620,4.048780487804878
