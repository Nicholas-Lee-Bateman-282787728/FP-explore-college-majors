8015921,5,B0001OGURM,"I've always been an avid Zatoichi fan.  For some reason this movie (#15) appears to be the hardest to find, and when you do find a seller the price is out of this world.  I was lucky to find a seller within what I was willing to spend and I'm glad I got it.
""Zatoichi's Cane Sword"" keeps pace with all of his other movies.  When ""The End"" comes on I feel like watching another of his flicks.  A great actor makes another great movie.  Nobody can make a better blind swordsman than Shintaro Katsu.",1417737600,,496,4.178947368421053
8015922,5,B0001OGURM,"See my reviews for Zatoichi 17, 23, and 25 for brief comments on the excellent sword play dramas starring Shintaro Katsu.  You may also want to get the tv episodes he produced after starring in the 26 Zatoichi films produced in the 1960's--to mid 1970's.  Consider also the great Baian series with the strong presence of Ken Watanabe as a medicine man who wields a mean acupuncture needle when necessary to dispose of a nefarious character.",1403568000,,440,4.776315789473684
8015923,5,B0001OGURM,"With an unpredictable plot full of intrigue and mystery centered around the origins of Zatoichi's seemingly magical sword, I think that Volume #15 Zatoichi's Cane Sword is one of the best Zatoichi episodes I have ever watched. Shintaro Katsu's genius comes shining through with his portrayal of the humble, bumbling, blind, master swordsman struggling to survive in the unforgiving world of feudal Japan. The acting. directing, expensive costuming and detailed movie sets are very convincing to any viewer of this action movie. I am so glad that I purchased this jewel. Zatoichi is the bomb and the gifted Shintaro Katsu is at his top form in this one. I highly recommend this Zatoichi episode.",1362700800,,694,5.0964912280701755
8015924,5,B0001OGURM,"A classical story - of greed, duty, and a sword maker.  Well, maybe not that classical, but it has all the elements of a wonderful Zatoichi moive.  Also the old ex-sword maker, who likes to drink, is played by Eijir Tno, who is a star in his own right.  You should know who he is unless you do not watch old Japanese movies.
As you can guess, the focus of these film is really about Zatoichi's sword and what may happen in his future.  Zatoichi is truly scared for the first time - worried about his future, his life, his choices.  Can he live without a sword?  Can he stop killing and go straight?
My DVD had a few trailers but not much in the way of extras - just a good movie.",1308700800,,679,4.067669172932331
8015925,5,B0001OGURM,"One of the finest of the Zatoichi series, the subtle and wild sides of his character are thoughtfully examined. And the bad guys really get it!",1202860800,,143,4.538461538461538
8015926,5,B0001OGURM,"Director Kimiyoshi Yasuda does a great job of building up the tension in this film. Adding to the tension is the possibility that Zato's trusty cane sword may soon fail in battle, as it is slightly cracked. The final fight takes place in a gorgeous snowy set with Zato carving his way out of a wooden barrel to slaughter a gang of criminals. This is otherwise a slow-paced film in terms of action.",1198800000,,397,4.4520547945205475
8015927,5,B0001OGURM,"This 15th entry into the Zatoichi series is a truly superb one. I highly recommend this episode. As this Zatoichi episode opens up, we find that Ichi has run afoul of the local gangs when he is gambling. Therefore, Zatoichi finds shelter in the local blacksmith's place. It is here that he discovers that his cane-sword is about to break. The blacksmith tells Ichi that if he uses the sword one more time it will snap.

What is poor Ichi to do? Long the companion of the blind masseur, the cane-sword must now be retired. Further, Ichi decides to give up the sword, and live a straight and narrow life. Really? Well, he tries to anyhow. But this is a Zatoichi movie right? Now, with all these ""bad-guys"" lurking all over the place how is this possible? Well its not. And when the locals are terrorized who else is there to help? You got it--Zatoichi. Not to let a bad sword stand in his way, there will be plenty of action to go around. Besides being a good drama, and action film, this Zatoichi episode is also a very humorus one as well.

The cinematography and acting are excellent--as usual. This Zatoichi episiode is a true delight. I do not wish to give away too much of this film, because I think that you will enjoy it, whether or not you are a Zatoichi fan. This is a great episode and most highly recommended.

8015928,5,B0001OGURM,"For 14 film's Zatoichi's trusty cane sword has been his constant traveling companion.  An extension of his body, it is what keeps the blind masseur from being a victim of his own handicap.  And what should happen if it should fail him?

That is the question of ""Zatoichi's Cane Sword""  (""Zatoichi Tekka Tabi"" or ""Zatoichi's Violent-tempered Journey"").  Through his usual gambling shenanigans, Zatoichi finds himself on the wrong side of a group of local gangsters.  Seeking shelter, he hides with an old blacksmith, who reveals the secret of Zatoichi's famous cane sword.  It was forged by a master swordsmith, the blacksmith's former master.  But Zatoichi has tested the strength of the forging for too long, and the sword will break if it is used again.  Zatoichi leaves behind the useless sword as a token or remeberence for the blacksmith's former master, and seeks a new path.

Feeling helpless and weak without his protection, and fearing for his handicap for the first time in years, Zatoichi abandons his violent, wandering life and takes up a position as a masseur in a local inn.  All seems well for a short while...but this is a Zatoichi film, and it isn't long before his good heart drags him into the inn's troubles, and he needs to arm himself again.

""Zatoichi's Cane Sword"" is a good chambara flick, with all the elements that make the series good film after film.  Seeing Ichi brought to a state of helplessness with out his sword is an interesting twist, as is seeing him afraid for perhaps the first time.  As always, Shintaro Katsu brings out the heart in the character, and even though the ending comes as no surprise, the journey is a good one.",1125014400,21,1666,4.7595818815331015
8015929,5,B0001OGURM,"First and foremost I would advise that any viewer who wants to add Zatoichi to their list of movies , do so by watching the first one. There are many values from this , the main one being the character outlines mean little if you have not followed him as he strolls through life, being the man he is I beleive it is crucial for the viewer to first understand much about him before watching this one. Zatoichi's Cane Sword was a very exciting film with lots of  plots and twists around every turn,duckhunt dancing and of course the beloved kindhearted yet deadly Zatoichi. Need I say more?  I awaited this one for a long time and was mighty pleased with it when I first saw it and any Zato fan would be advised to add this one to the collection. I will not give away any of the movie because I had to buy it as well. Regardless what some might say about the man verse the myth I would say that these are plainly ,some of the best films I have ever seen. Some like to spend time putting down a man's life work with a few harsh words when the true fact is that they themselves are the ones they speak of. In Shintaro Katsu's case let us relish in the true beauty of one man's work and the undying gift he left all of us......ZATOICHI..............",1091923200,14,1244,4.200836820083682
