I'm just going to be totally honest and say it's not rocket science - it's all power chords,  and combining them along with different rhythms to produce a punk style sounding (along with a guitar with humbuckers and appropriate gain on your amp to distort, of course). It's all about attitude, and producing sound that reflects that attitude. This isn't some virtuoso shred master really complex fingering stuff here. So I would say almost any guitarist should be able to pick this up and run with it.

This guy breaks down some really nice power chord combinations and rhythms for you. Practicing what he gives you will allow you to play. Then once you can do that well the next step would be taking that knowledge and coming up with your own chord and rhythm combinations. But he for sure gets you off to a good running start, and it's very doable in 8 weeks.",1490486400,2,982,4.536723163841808
