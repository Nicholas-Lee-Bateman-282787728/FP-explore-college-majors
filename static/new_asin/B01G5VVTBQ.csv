8762342,2,B01G5VVTBQ,"Veep is an intermittently funny show.  I have the complete 6 season set which I don't see currently listed on Amazon.  We were able to watch about half of the series and then gave it up.  All the characters in it, including the V.P., are so relentlessly stupid, dumb in almost everything they do or say, that none of them would have been able to keep their jobs for a day.  I know the show is meant to be a wicked satire, so to speak, but if satire is to work it must have some grounding in plausibility.  This show lacks that altogether.  As a consequence, it is far more often irritating than funny.  Unless you are a fan of the Stooges, dumb deeds don't make for good wit.

Furthermore, everyone in the show, no matter the character is, as relentlessly, vulgar.  The number of four letter words per sentence is astonishing and grows very quickly boring.  The remarks they all make to one another are usually sexual in one way or another, mostly aspersions and innuendos of various kinds, often homophobic and always degrading.  There is nothing intelligent or witty or perceptive about any of this.

Veep is throughout mean-spirited and ugly.  The characters are not only stupid in everything they do and say.  They are also quick to betray one another whenever they can.  There are no morality or ethical principles in sight anywhere.  Perhaps politics is a vile as this show depicts it to be.  But, even if that is so, to watch it is to feel, far too often, corrupted by it.  If there were deeper perceptions or underlying cogent motives to it, Veep might be better.  But it is a mindless show that relies nearly all the time on the worst of what people are capable of in politics to make its puerile points.",1506902400,,1713,4.485436893203883
