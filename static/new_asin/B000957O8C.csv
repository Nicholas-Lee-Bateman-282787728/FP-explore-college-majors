Anyone who is on the brink of buying this, I say dive in head first

Every single episode makes me crack up and no doubt you will love each and every episode...Kevin, Leah, and Jerry all work together so well

Best comedy, right up there with Honeymooners...a must buy!!!",1118880000,3,344,4.34375
2265322,5,B000957O8C,"First seen this comedy last year while on holiday in florida,absolutly amazing. It is my ambition to be Doug Heffernan. As soon as i got back to the UK i ordered series 1,now have up to series 3 and i am waiting for this,number 4!If any of the cast or crew read this,thankyou for making me piss my pants. It is better than any comedy shown on British Televison,thank god it is shown on paramount on cable over yuh. CLASS.",1118534400,5,421,4.275
2265323,5,B000957O8C,"King of Queens has been one of my favorite shows for some time and one of the very few good comedies on TV.  Problem is that CBS has just screwed with the time and date so much that it's made it lose momentum.  I see that CBS has now moved the show back to Monday nights where it started and where it ALWAYS should have been left.  This is one of those shows I love because they never take things too seriously.  Like other greats such as Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond, I don't think we'll ever see a ""Very special episode of King of Queens"" that's played for drama.  NOTHING kills a comedy more than drama.  This a wonderful show with a fairly small, but crazy ensemble cast of characters.  Nicole Sullivan, fresh from Mad TV would become a semi-regular this season as a dog walker who walks Carrie's Dad Arthur!

Here are the highlights of season Four

""Walk man""  Holly (Sullivan) a dog walker is hired by Doug to occupy Arthur's time as she pretends to be interested in his boring war stories.

""No Retreat"" Doug and Carrie are invited to her company's retreat for a weekend and Doug isn't happy about it.  Doug ends up lying to Carrie's boss when he claims to have climed Mt. Everest.

""Tricker Treat""  A classic episode.  Arthur it seems has a phobia about Halloween decorations and forbids Doug to put them up.  Doug puts them up anyway and Arthur is so frightened by a paper ghost that he ends up in the hospital.  Hilarious!

""Life Insurance""  As Doug and Carrie check out life insurance plans, Doug is terrified that he might have to take care of Arthur if Carrie dies first.  They install a camera so they can keep an eye on Arthur in the basement and Deacon and Spence have fun watching Arthur.

""Food Fight""  Carrie is upset with Doug when he is infatuated by Spence's new girlfriend.  Turns out she's a chef and Doug is infatuated with her cooking.

""Bun Dummy"" - Doug is anxious to show off his beautiful wife at his high school reunion but hates Carrie wearing her hair in a bun all the time and tries to make her change it.

""Eddie Money""  Doug and Deacon win $5,000 gambling on a boxing match but Doug doesn't want to tell Carrie because he stole the $100 for the bet from their emergency money fund.

Those are my favorites but there's really not any sour notes in this season.  It's a great show and hopefully the move back to Mondays will boost the ratings.",1117065600,31,2385,4.395881006864989

Shortly after, I saw a bulk pack available for the complete series for approx. $35 and bought that for the price.  The only draw back on the bulk package purchase is that the descriptions and nice packing you get with the individual season purchases is not that great with the bulk package set.

Other than a few changes with some of the co-stars, the core humor is always present, and everyone (even the revolving door of side-kicks) are perfectly cast & extremely entertaining. Season 4 is one of the best, but choosing a bad or mediocre season is actually impossible. The ""feel-good"" factor rates a 10!!",1345420800,,419,4.833333333333333

Even though you can see the Heffernan's, Arthur and their friends develop with each new season, each season can stand alone as Dough gets himself into a different situation in each episode!! James, Remini and Stiller are excellent together, a perfect comedy team and they just keep getting better.

Seinfeld is too slapstick'ish' and I hate Everybody Loves Raymond. Romano is such a lame actor.

2265525,4,B000957O8C,"This show is great.  Completely agree with the previous reviews on how CBS screwed with it's momentum.

The only thing I'd change is that by season 4 the show becomes just a little bit predictable.  Doug becomes dumber and hungrier with each episode and Carrie becomes angrier and bitchier.  I wish it was more like the first couple of seasons where Carrie would be really sweet some times and totally explode other times.  Kept you guessing.  By the time I got to season 4 you knew what was going to happen.  Doug was going to do something not so smart, and Carrie was going to Whip him into shape.  The only character that continues to be unpredictable in his antics is Artie.  You can see seasons one through 4 all in one shot and still not get tired of Jerry Stiller in this role.  The Deacon Character is great too.  Still a great show and will be getting season 5 when it finally comes out.",1139788800,,896,4.36969696969697

2265527,5,B000957O8C,"As I said in my review of the series ""Charmed"".  Why are these shows released so slowly when they have been around so long and are popular?  Recent, stupid shows have released their DVD's faster.  That stinks and it's irritating.  When are we going to get Season 5 of this show?!!!!  Of course, then we'll just be waiting another year for season 6 and so on (ugh).  Anyone else agree?

Still waiting to see ""Mamma's Family"" released on DVD, but I have a feeling I'll be holding my breathe 'til I'm dead. lol",1138665600,,507,4.387096774193548

Jerry Stiller is ok but the chemistry between Kevin James and Leah Remini is really underrated--these two, whether trying to dance the salsa or cope with Carrie's cheap lasik at Vision Village or any of their other antics--are almost funnier than The Honeymooners.",1135036800,4,366,5.220338983050848

2265546,4,B000957O8C,"I wish I could agree that the video transfer of this is  perfect, but I can't. Maybe it's because I'm watching on a big screen TV but I've seen the same thing in all of  the first four seasons released on DVD so far. And although it isn't enough that anyone shouldn't buy it, why should this be on a current show? This isn't an older show and I've seen others that are that have less grain. I guess it's compression but why isn't the studio giving more care to what's been one of few really funny shows that been on TV in quite a few years. Some look fine and some  go from good to grainy in the same episode. This show  deserves a lot more respect than it gets, maybe even  from its own studio. The ""Shrink Wrap"" episode has so much grain when Carrie goes back to watch herself as a a child that it seems like a third or fourth generation copy. But I've now noticed it also looks sub-par in theon air reruns. Watch this show. It's great. Buy the DVDs. Doug and Carrie and Arthur and all the  rest are great. And the DVDs still look bette than what we see on the air, but I hope the studio gives it more care in future releases. It deserves it...And I'd love to see someone do a behind the scenes book and episode guide to the show with comments from the cast and writers. This show is gonna last a long time in reruns.

8057245,5,B000957O8C,"This hilarious comedy stars Kevin James and Leah Remini as married couple Doug and Carrie Heffernan. During their days, Doug's a parcel deliveryman and Carrie's a legal assistant; during their nights, they come home to Queens and Carrie's widowed father Arthur (Jerry Stiller) who lives with them.

Storylines follow the usual marital dispute route (e.g. home responsibilities, money and sex), dealings with the eccentric Arthur or Doug's best friends Deacon, Spence and cousin Danny. This season, Doug and Carrie are also trying to conceive. There's also sure to be some rather bizarre moments, such as when Doug hires Holly (Nicole Sullivan) as a dog-walker -- to take Arthur out each day.

As a bonus, the final episode ""Shrink Wrap"" includes a cameo by Ben Stiller -- playing Arthur's father in a flashback.

For an engaging and true-to-life show with lots of laughs, be sure to check out this series!",1486339200,,905,5.060402684563758
