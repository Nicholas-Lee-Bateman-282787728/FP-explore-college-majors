348824,4,6301706498,"Release date ""I MARRIED A WITCH"" DVD: March 24, 2006.

April 4, 2006: this morning the sealed ""I MARRIED A WITCH"" DVD arrived, finally.

However... a big disappointment, in regards of the video & sound quality of this DVD: very, very bad:

a. the audio: the sound is like medium-wave, or a 78 rpm record, noisy, hiss, hum; a ""nosy sound"". Music with disortion.

b. video: like a VHS copy. Faces are often difficult to recognize; some drop-outs too.

c. less important: scene selection: 8; no subtitles, no extra's.

It's not a restored and/or a remastered film; in my opinion the manufacturer copied a VHS tape.

A pal bought this DVD also, the same results, and he is disappointed too. We look forward to a restored version; this nice comedy deserves it!

Summary: the film is OK, Veronica Lake is a great actress, but this DVD release is a big disappointment.

A couple of witches are burned in Salem during the pilgrim days, but they first put a curse on the Wooley family and all of their heirs: they will all marry the wrong women.  A curse, indeed!

Then Wallace Wooley (Fredric March), in modern times, is running for Governor at the same time that the spirits of the two witches resurface, at the very time that Estelle Masterson (Susan Hayward) and Wally are about to be married.  But things go awry when Jennifer, the witch (Veronica Lake) takes a love potion by mistake, and falls for Wally.

This is a funny movie, and was the inspiration for the TV series
starring Elizabeth Montgomery based on the same premise.

348826,5,6301706498,This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is hilarous and the character of Veronica Lake is sooooo great. I have seen this movie at least 10 times and it does not loose its wonderful quaint humour and overall movie viewing joy. I would give it 10 stars out of 5 if I could.,1061856000,8,289,3.9152542372881354
348827,5,6301706498,"I first saw this film as a small child on the Late Late Show. I have never forgotten how funny it was or how beautiful Veronica Lake looked in this film. In the end she is suppose to go back in the magical tree that she came from when it was hit by lightning in the beggining of the story. She must leave Fredrick March and seemingly go back broken hearted because of her feelings for him. Nothing could stop this sad ending.  However when the moment comes that she is to return to the tree, she is able to stay and she said the words that have been with me since I was seven years old, ""There is no power stronger than Love"",  Her acting ability and her humorus character were excellent. Never miss a chance to see this movie!",1057795200,7,727,4.148936170212766
348828,5,6301706498,"I first saw the film in France (and in French) some 30 years ago. Oh my Gosh! The plot is funny, enthralling and well-build. Veronika Lake is absolutely gorgeous, as a witch and as a loving woman. She makes you dream all along the pictures. At the end, her old drunkard of a father is jailed in a bottle of gin or whisky and his witchcraft is supposed to be out of order, love wins over witchcraft...but the sight of the kid on a broom suggests that the power might rise again some day. It is a must, with ""Laura"" from Otto Preminger.",1047340800,5,534,4.194174757281553

348830,5,6301706498,"I once did a list for a friend of the ten sexiest female characters in the movies.  Veronica Lake's lovely witch ranked very high on that list.  Although she starred in several other classic films from 1942 to 1946, this movie is easily my favorite.  Much of her reputation today is based on her several appearances in film noir classics (THIS GUN FOR HIRE, THE GLASS KEY, and THE BLUE DAHLIA), but I actually preferred her in this film and to a lesser degree SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS.
The rest of the cast is just as delightful.  Fredric March is everything you could ask a romantic lead who is descended from Puritans to be, and Cecil Kellaway and Robert Benchley take turns stealing scenes.
Of all the European directors forced by political turmoil in Germany and Italy to work in the US temporarily in the thirties and forties, Rene Clair probably had the most successful record.  While his best work remains the extraordinary films he made in the early thirties working in France (SOUS LES TOITS DE PARIS,  NOUS LA LIBERT, and, my favorite Clair film, LE MILLION), he nonetheless managed to make some exquisite films both in England (THE GHOST GOES WEST) and the US (IT HAPPENED TOMORROW and the marvelous comic mystery film AND THEN THERE WERE NONE).
Much is made of the fact that I MARRIED A WITCH inspired the sixties TV show BEWITCHED, but I think this can be overdone.  BEWITCHED was a situation comedy, whereas I MARRIED A WITCH depends much more on the irony of a witch falling in love with the ancestor of the Puritans who had cursed her a few hundred years before.  In BEWITCHED, it is immaterial who Darrin and Samantha's forebears were, whereas the heart of the movie depends on ancestry.
All lovers of classic comedy, classic Hollywood, or classic directors should definitely see this film if they haven't already.",1009497600,64,1825,4.716981132075472
348831,5,6301706498,"Rene Clair's greatest American film, with the old Surrealist turning what could have been merely a supernatural comic romp into something truly plangent.  Veronica Lake plays the spirit of a witch burnt by Puritans in the 17th century, cursing the descendents of her denouncer to eternal marital malaise (the wonderful period prologues predate Monty Python by decades in their anachronistic lampooning of history).  Fast forward to the present where the latest sap, Fredric March, is about to be married to a REAL witch (a fabulously imperious Susan Hayward), on the eve of running for governor as puppet for her media-baron father.  Lake decides on some spirited revenge, attempting to destroy March's life by making him fall in love with her; only, through a botched spell, finding herself smitten.
'I Married a Witch' is more than an antique precursor to the incomparable TV series 'Bewitched'.  it is one of Clair's most expertly constructed farces, full of his recognisable art-deco geometry; with the mixture of sex, magic and politics provoking irresistable set-pieces, such as the pair's introduction in a burning hotel; Lake's pointed attempts to seduce and compromise March by commandeering his bedroom; or the glorious, sustained fiasco of the wedding sequence, a real shotgun wedding, complete with hurricanes, kitsch operetta and murder.  The corruption of 'interests'-dominated America and the impressionability of the electorate are satirised, while serious points are made about the country's historical legacy, the ghosts of its past materialising to avenge long-forgotten crimes.  Lake has never been more purringly lovable - I can believe her as a sorceress, sliding down curved bannisters, unpeeling her fur coat in taxis; March is one of the few dramatic actors who could excel in comedy while retaining serious pathos; only Robert Benchley could manage to make selfless friendship seem like lecherous self-interest.
But 'Witch' offers even more.  The whole project of Surrealism was based on a very simple principle - the desire to make life, the everyday weighed down by banal routine, seem magical, fresh, new.  Before Lake comes into his life, March, a kind of Everyman, was depressed and helpless, on the threshold of all kinds of prisons, domestic and professional.  Lake's magic in this case is not simply the fantasy of genre, but a genuine transformative power, a spiritual enchantment, an offer of freedom through new insight, new sight.  Where once fire was a political tool of oppression, here it is purifying and engendering.  This is why the supernatural scenes here have an uncanny force you simply don't get in most fantasy films, that haunt you long after you've seen 'Witch'.  The last ten minutes are hard to beat in American film, comedy or otherwise.  Fantastic.",1004572800,50,2804,5.274157303370787
348832,5,6301706498,"I used to enjoy this movie as a child. I made my daughter watch this movie against her will at the age of 9. Now at 18 she still loves watching this movie.
Recently I had my nieces over for the weekend after I had purchased this movie and Bell, Book and Candle from Amozon.com. I asked my nieces (both 10) if they wanted to watch these movies. Both were very reluctant to watch a black and white movie. As the movie got further into the story I could see the look on their faces..(brought back a lot of memories.) We only had enough time to watch this one...both have requested this movie for their Christmas list.
I really can't say enough about this movie. It has a very charming quality.",1002585600,13,690,4.2748091603053435
348833,4,6301706498,"A delightful ghost-witch film which spoofs the genre. Kellaway and his fetching daughter Lake are branded witches in 1690 and condemned to a New England stake. In 1942, Lake comes back to life and marries Fredric March and the results are hilarious! Veronica Lake does amazingly well condsidering she had been in films only a year and Susan Hayward is both pretty and surly at the same time, no small feat of acting. This is indeed a film to keep on video, for it would repeatedly soothe away a wakeful night.  Almost carelessly, it use the most professional means to entrance eye and ear throughout its running time.  It's not the kind of film which requires roars of approving laughter: the occasional quiet chuckle is much more in its line, as it dispenses a delightful sense of oddity and enchantment.  The film's only sin is that it more or less wastes Mr. Benchley, though he has one delightfully confused exit line after light has dawned on him that his friend's wife is really a witch:  ""Oh well, it's late, I've got to be getting into my strait jacket. ""I'll call a broom"".  Rene Clair's direction is swift and sure and this is Hollywood moonshine, impeccably distilled.",946857600,2,1179,4.703883495145631

348966,5,6301706498,"Fredric March of ""Seven Days in May"" (1964) fame gets to quickly play several descendents of the pilgrim Wooley (Jonathan, Nathaniel, Samuel, and Wallace.) That is the pilgrim that burned witches, Jennifer (Veronica Lake) and Daniel (Cecil Kellaway) in the 17th century. On their way up in smoke, a curse is placed on the Wooley descendents, that they should me unhappily married.

It was inevitable that the evil father and daughter witch team would return to do more mischief. Will this backfire and will he or she learn from not to be so evil or will they keep it bottled up?

You may be able to identify with the curse. So you need to be sure your spouse sees you laugh at this.

This is one of those situation comedies that you just assume they end up to grater. Don't be too sure.

There is really very little resemblance between this story and the situation comedy ""Bewitched"".

I have has several copies as they slowly improve the picture and even the sound. The best copy at the time of this review is I Married a Witch (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]. They used a 2k restoration process. There are a couple of times that it looks like they missed; however for the most part it is a perfect restoration.

349329,4,6301706498,"This Film and the film Bell Book and Candle are the Grandparents of the TV show Bewitched according to the creator, Sol Saks. I Married a Witch stars Veronica Lake and Frederic March. Lake was the famous blonde beauty of the 1940's with her flowing locks always draped over one eye. Frederic March is better known for his performance in Inherit the Wind, but in this film, he plays the love interest of Veronica Lake, which is nice work if you can get it. Lake plays a New England witch who was burned at the stake along with her father in the 17th Century. Their ashes were buried under an oak tree so that their spirits would be trapped forever. Yes, I know, Oak trees don't last forever, but in any event their spirits were finally freed in 1942 by a lightning bolt which struck the tree, splitting it asunder and freeing the two witches. They are understandably miffed at the man who imprisoned them and vow a curse on all those born in the future who bear his name. Naturally, they seek out the living family member and plot to make his life unbearable. I won't reveal more so as not to spoil the fun. The film is essentially a lighthearted romantic comedy with some hocus pocus thrown in. I found it to be very entertaining and especially enjoyed the charm of a film which didn;t try to impress me with its intellectual superiority by giving the characters snarky, condescending lines so common in films today. After you see the film you'll understand why it gave Sol Saks the idea for Bewitched with Elizabeth Montgomery. Bell Book and Candle with Kim Novak and James Stewart also gave Saks ideas for Bewitched. It's another film I recommend you own, rent or download.",1469232000,3,1675,4.549668874172186

These older movies did not rely on lots of one liner's and profanity to be funny.  The set up humorous situations.  Veronica Lake is Jennifer, a witch, burned to death along with her father, back in the day of the Salem Witch trials.  Frederic March, who plays the main character and his own ancestors is cursed to marry the wrong woman.  In the present day Wallace Wooley, is about to marry, Estelle, Susan Hayward, when lightning strikes the tree holding the spirits of Jennifer and her father prisoner.  They escape and Daniel, her father, sets an old building on fire to give Jennifer a body.  She is rescued by Wooley, and things get crazy from then on.

349709,5,6301706498,"This is one of a few films that I can go to when I want my spirits lifted ( no pun intended).It is eminently watchable, and totally charming. I wish I had bought it on Blu-Ray in retrospect but I had overdone my budget on that area. One of the reasons I was buying it was to find out the pre-cursors to Bewitched, and since I had seen BRASS BOTTLE years back, I also bought BELL BOOK AND CANDLE. When I watched this film for the first time in this DVD format, I realized I had seen it in the 70's albeit edited. As much as I have heard some of the names in the film, I don't really care when it comes to watching it. Dissecting the film is not going to make the film any better, not will I understand why it has this fabulous ability to touch my heart. It is a romance with a beautifully done backdrop and it is eminently enjoyable. The DVD pack has an essay that I must admit I have not read yet, so it has one nice extra for those who enjoy reading about the film ( some Blu-Rays are done in Book or Booklet form, and depending on the Movie, this makes for an expansive enjoyment in my view, and I have read some of those). I Would suspect that you have to be of a particular mindset to take this film on board, or just basically experience it for what it is, a classic piece of cinema crafted by a team of people who evidently appeared to know what they were doing. I enjoyed it years ago on TV, and I enjoy this film now. I am not surprised that there is apparently many layers to this film, since the artists of this world can entertain and do that with a message ( or is the message more about what you see as the viewer ? ). Anyway, lovely on multiple levels, and an enjoyable work of cinema in the fullest sense.",1430611200,,1720,4.017492711370262

349777,4,6301706498,"A fun little film you'll enjoy if you don't get your hopes up and know exactly what it is:  a soft-hearted, slightly romantic light comedy that will fit perfectly with your expectations for the time (1942).  If that is what you are looking for, it is an easy buy.  If you're looking for sophisticated fair or something more modern go elsewhere, but director Rene Sinclair still had enough of a touch for it to be very well executed.  Sinclair knew what this film was and what it wasn't, and for the most part struck the right chords.  If it was put in a niche today, it would equally vie for being a good date movie and ""the feel good movie"" of the summer :)

Although leading actors Veronica Lake and Frederic March were fighting like cats and dogs off-screen (and apparently, hard drinking Lake fought with everybody), their on-screen chemistry hits it stride about 1/3 into the movie after a slow start. Basic premise revolves around an aspiring politician whose family has been cursed by a warlock since the late 1700s, even though the warlock and his daughter remain ""trapped"" under a puritan oak tree, until it is struck by lightening at the beginning of the film. Running for governor and marrying for the wrong reasons, March gets ""sidetracked"" by a mischievous Lake who takes turns hurting and helping him, as he continues to fall in and out of love with her. Surely whoever later came up with the TV show 'Bewitched' saw this film. Even features a little ""Tabitha to be"" at the very end.

This is not slapstick comedy, but there are definitely four or five good chuckles and many smiles along the way.  Criterion has done a fairly good job cleaning it up, and it looks well even on a large screen TV if one can ignore a few spots of bad film here and there (overall, still very good).  Interestingly, one of the bonus features includes an audio commentary, radio interview with Clair from 1950, in which he laments that all of the good copies from some of his 1920s films have gone missing, and how he wishes someone would take an interest in preserving old films for posterity.

Black and white, 77 minutes, 1.33:1 (old TV) aspect ratio.  You'll enjoy this movie as long as no one tries to oversell it.",1423958400,2,2213,4.563131313131313

349858,5,6301706498,"Excellent film about a 16th century witch who places a curse upon her lover who denounced her as a sorceress to be burned at the stake. The curse causes the Wooley family men to marry insufferable shrewish women to torture them for life. Which, as seen through a series of vignettes, comes to pass for the next several centuries. The spell cannot be broken until a Wooley descendant willingly consents to marry a witch to break the curse. Jennifer (the witch) and her father Daniel (a warlock) were burned and their ashes were buried beneath an oak tree on the Wooley family property to trap their evil spirits - three hundred year later, the tree is stuck by lightning, freeing Jennifer and Daniel as 'Witch's Smoke'. Finding the Wooley family manor and discovering what changes the centuries have made, they find ""Master Wooley"" is running for office and is engaged to be married to a suitably shrewish woman. Upon hearing about the curse that his daughter cast, Daniel remarked it was a foolish curse ""for all men who marry, marry the wrong woman"" ""True suffering comes when a man is in love with a woman he cannot marry"" Hearing this, Jennifer decides to ensnare Master Wooley and make him fall in love with her for she would not marry him to truly torture him. Upon getting a body by burning a building (Fire was the same way she lost her old body) she sets out to complicate his life but gets caught in her own spell in the process. This film and Bell, Book And Candle are credited as the inspiration for the ""Bewitched"" T.V. Series. A fun film to watch, and a very nicely restored print transferred in 2K makes for a crisp picture with good sound. - This review is for the Criterion Blu-Ray Disc.",1423353600,,1703,4.550488599348534

The potion she conjures to get Frederic March to love her is totally superfluous because any hot blooded male wouldn't need it to fall head over heels for her.

350081,5,6301706498,"Classic story of desire and punishment -- with supernatural overtones.

A young Frederic March plays the protagonist who has ancestors antagonized Veronica Lake's character and her father, played by Cecil Kelloway -- the angel from ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  Lake and Kelloway are supernatural beings -- witches -- and live in a tree on March's family estate.

March is engaged, of course.  Lake seduces him away from his fiancee, marries him -- against Kelloway's wishes, and the fun begins.

The special effects are wonderful for their time.  The story is fun, the acting superb, the transfer by Criterion^^ is fabulous.

350140,3,6301706498,"Humor is subjective and no doubt there are many who would consider this film funnier than I did. I knew going in that Preston Sturges produced the film, but to me it doesn't measure up to any of the films Sturges wrote and directed. I don't know the filmography of the French director, Ren Clair. Apparently he made more experimental films in the 1920's and 30's.

This film, however, is a pure Hollywood star vehicle for Veronica Lake and quite successful judged by that criteria. Lake plays a 200+ year old witch who cursed the Wooley family in the Puritan days, only to find herself falling in love with the current Wooley (Frederick March). Her warlock father, meanwhile, wants to continue the curse. All of this spellduggery takes farcical turns as it affects Wooley's impending marriage and his political campaign for state governor. Lake is super-sexy; March and Robert Benchley (playing the best friend) earn some grins as straight men. But in general I was expecting a spoof about sexual mores and politics to have a lot more bite.

The setup was better than the execution. Technically, the film is beautifully shot and as usual Criterion makes a fantastic presentation. Not everything is pristine with the print Criterion used. I don't know if that was because they didn't have the budget to search out more pristine elements or if they tried and none better existed. I've certainly seen other studio films from this period in better condition.

Historians of fantasy films and old Hollywood visual effects would probably find this film of interest. Clair took a special interest in optical printing and clever practical rigs to create the witchcraft, although most of it is subtle, rather than dazzling. As excellent as the special effects were for their day, they are cheesy by today's standards.

The bonus features are pretty light for a Criterion release. There is one very basic archival radio interview with Clair and a more insightful print interview. The essay, by Guy Maddin, is great. And I say this as someone who is not a fan of Mr. Maddin's films. I would have liked to get a feature-length commentary from an old Hollywood historian who could point why exactly, of all the excellent comedies that came out of Hollywood in the early 1940's, this one is worthy of a Criterion treatment.",1395878400,,2309,4.867684478371501

350144,4,6301706498,"In the 1600s, two witches (a father and a daughter) are to be burned at the stake on the accusation of Puritan Jonathan Wooley (Fredrick March). The daughter curses Wooley and all his descendants--they will be unhappy in marriage. We see Jonathan is already about to be yoked unhappily to a shrewish Puritan girl who's come to see the witches burn. We also see a vendor selling snacks to the crowd like a hot-dog vendor at a ballpark. The Puritans plant a tree over the witches' grave to keep their spirits from wandering and causing mischief. This doesn't prevent the daughter's spell from ruining the marriages of the Wooley family as we see in a montage.

The movie moves forward 270 years to Wallace Wooley (also Frederick March), descendant of Jonathan who is about to be married (unhappily) and be elected governor (his bride-to-be's father is a newspaper owner whose been orchestrating the election). One fundraiser just before the wedding is near where the witches were buried. A lighting storm comes up and strikes the tree. The tree breaks and the two spirits escape. They float over to the party (they're just puffs of smoke) and discuss what is happening (and also the shocking behavior of the modern people--dancing so close and dresses that show arms and backs!). The father says his daughter's curse would be much better if the fellow falls in love with someone else and then marries the shrew.

The daughter agrees and they fly off to do the spell that will give her a body. They have to burn a house down as part of the spell, so they burn down the Puritan Hotel. Wallace and his finance are driving back and get caught in traffic caused by the fire. Wallace goes into the hotel because he hears a woman's voice. He finds the witch Jennifer (Veronica Lake) and saves her from the fire. He doesn't recognize she's a witch because...well...the spell only grants her a body, not clothing. He gives her his coat and they escape the building. Romantic entanglements begin!

The movie is entertaining with some nice twists and a few contrivances. It isn't super-funny like Bringing Up Baby or It Happened One Night, but is funny enough. The comedy is fairly broad but still works. March and Lake are a fun couple. The special effects are fairly impressive for 1942. The movie is a fine-looking light supernatural comedy.",1391385600,,2331,4.750617283950617

More perky, than bombshell ( she was barely 5'0 tall, I believe), nonetheless, she knows how to deliver her lines with just the right lilt and intonation to be suggestive. Frederic March as her love interest was still considered a leading man at this time, but I think just barely. He was a little middle-ageish for this role considering Lake was only 20 years old in 1942, and she looks it. So not really much believeable chemistry from this pairing.

I don't have much to say other than this is a great transfer of a charming old movie that is just as good as I remember it from late-night TV many years ago. I chose the DVD rather then Blu-ray and have no quibbles at all about the quality. It's at least as good as all my other Criterion editions.

On the movie: I wanted to wring Cecil Kellaway's neck; he's that good. Fredric March was an extremely talented actor whom time has relegated to less-than-top-tier actor status, and I'm not sure why. His performance as the tortured vet in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was haunting, and his performance here in screwball comedy was lighter than air. Robert Benchley in the supporting role of best friend was a delight, as usual. I wouldn't be surprised if he wrote most or all of his dialog just as he did for Alfred Hitchcock's ""Foreign Correspondent."" If you aren't a fan of  Veronica Lake, you will be after seeing this film. (Her noir films are da bomb, too.)

On the extras: Loved the booklet with the essay by Guy Maddin and the (old) interview with the director, Rene Clair. I really didn't know much about him before. I haven't listened to the audio interview with Clair yet.",1388448000,,1204,4.488584474885845

It begins in the crowd; the town has turned out for the burning of two witches, and they were witches in the oldest stereotypical meaning.  Smoke rises from the hill, the deed already done, the pop-meze vendor is trying to hawk the last of his wares before the crowd disburses, and the camera moves in to hear a conversation between a man, Mr. Worley, and his mother.  We gather the man turned the woman and her father in, and she cursed him and all of his male progeny who will always marry very, very badly.  His mother calls another woman to them, we find she is his bride-to-be, and receive a glimpse of how very bad it will indeed be for him and his descendants.  A man of authority moves through the crowd with a sapling, telling us they are planting it on the site to trap the spirits of the dead within the tree forever.  This is the beginning, and we jump forward in time from unhappy Worley, to unhappy Worley until present day, where we find the current Mr. Worley will marry badly tomorrow.

So where does the Witch he married come in you ask?  We see the tree struck by lightning, releasing the spirits of father, and daughter.  Now the fun begins, forsooth it is a comedy after all, and to say more would spoil to fun.",1384646400,6,1598,4.223684210526316
350340,2,6301706498,"70 reviews! 47 of the 5 stars! Why not mine?

Because this isn't all that funny. Oh, it has some laughs; but it is not up to ""madcap comedy"" standards. If you want to see what a ""madcap comedy"" was like, take a look at /His Girl Friday/ or /It Happened One Night/. One problem is that the ""finds herself drawn to one of them"" suggests that she falls for him all on her own, which might have been more effective, but which is not the case.

I don't doubt that this film provided audiences with a welcome diversion at the start of WW II. And it does get a little hectic in spots. But nothing like as hectic as /One, Two, Three/ or /Some Like It Hot/ get.

I rented the standard definition video file, so I cannot comment on the DVD or BluRay quality. I can say, however, that many of the Criterions I have purchased over the years on DVD have appeared rather skimpy on extras. This is not a problem as such for me as I don't consider extras to have any economic value, but some Criterion DVDs are priced higher than most DVDs are (not this one, however), and the lack of extras does make them appear skimpy.

Still, if you want an older film or a film the studio doesn't want to put out for some reason and it is on Criterion, at least you know you will get a competently done movie. For example, an el-cheapo DVD of /Charade/ that I tried was missing two minutes of film because the owner of the print used had clearly been watching his favorite scenes over and over again until the film broke and they were lost. And what were his favorite scenes? The same as my favorite scenes, and probably yours as well. Still, to be fair, it was letterboxed and (unlike the VHS I replaced it with) had the colors right. I replaced it with the Criterion version and got the entire film. Which, being Criterion, was also letterboxed and also had the colors done correctly, expected.

(Personally, I'd love to hear all the details of Lake's shenanigans; apparently, she was quite the practical joker).  It's sad though, to think that's how she was remembered, as someone few wanted to work with and those who suffered through a movie with her rarely wanted to work with her again.  Even if she did nothing else of importance, she still had this to claim as a minor masterpiece.  This is a fun, sly film.

I saw this movie more than 35 years ago and enjoyed it a great deal.  It was the first movie that  I ever saw Veronica Lake.  I am now hard of hearing and must rely on captions.  While there are a number of DVD manufacturers who do a shoddy job of transferring movies and never have closed captions, there is absolutely no reason in the world why a company like Criterion, who prides itself on production values, not to include closed captions or subtitles.  Shame on them.  This movie comes on TCM every so often, but it is never closed captioned.  This was my last shot of ever seeing it again.

350442,4,6301706498,"There are many reviews available which will tell you about ""I Married a Witch"": that Veronica Lake and Fredric March star and loathed each other; that the French director Rene Clair brought his visual flair and romantic appeal to the film; that Paramount sold the film to United Artists in a package; that Veronica Lake is perfectly cast as an ""out of this world"" vamp etc etc. I will only add that Fredric March is much too old for his role but being the consummate professional, his problems with his co-star are not really evident. A young Susan Hayward plays his fiancee and is very strident. The film is charming rather than funny - there is a difference.

The most important thing to note is that this is a Criterion production which means the print is first rate, the theatrical trailer is included but, by Criterion standards, the extras are only adequate. There are 2 really excellent essays about the director and the production enclosed in a quality booklet. There is also a radio interview with the director from over 50 years ago. This is only fair because Claire's accent is quite thick and the interviewer has the irritating habit of putting his own verbose interpretations into his loaded questions. More than once Claire simply disagrees.

In revenge, Jennifer cursed all future generations of the Wooley family, that the sons will always marry the wrong woman and be miserable. In the 20th century, a bolt of lightning frees Jennifer and her father from the tree that had kept their souls imprisoned. Jennifer assumes corporeal form and decides to make up-and-coming politician Wallace Wooley, then unhappily engaged, even more miserable by getting him to fall in love with her before his wedding. Wallace is a straight arrow, though, and Jennifer has to resort to a love potion. As we all know, love potions tend to backfire, with comedic results.
If, you want just Great Movie Fun and no analyzing, this is it.  Lastly, for me this was an Outstanding performance by her.  Tell me you can take your eyes off her.  Unlike Sullivan's Travels with Joel McCrea, which was Great, this movie showcases all of her Talent.

350550,3,6301706498,"I MARRIED A WITCH (1942) is a cute comedy-fantasy from director Rene' Clair.  It has some funny moments and, for the period, its visual effects are impressive.  The film was probably an inspiration for the popular BEWITCHED television series.

In it, Veronica Lake plays a sultry witch.  Centuries after cursing the male descendants of the Salem puritan who sent her to the stake, she finds herself drawn to one of them.  He's a prospective governor (Fredric March), about to marry a spoiled rich girl (Susan Hayward), but Veronica is determined that that marriage will never take place.

I know that many people consider I MARRIED A WITCH to be a comedy classic, but I am not one of them.  And, I think that the primary problem with the picture is that the two leads are miscast.

Fredric March was one of America's finest dramatic actors, a two-time Academy Award winner.

The key word in that previous sentence is ""dramatic,"" because although March did do other comedies during his career (e.g. NOTHING SACRED), comedy was not his forte'.  He did not possess the ""comic touch"".  Indeed, his role in I MARRIED A WITCH called for the deft timing of a Cary Grant or a Fred MacMurray.

The same criticism applies to Veronica Lake, a perky actress of limited talent, who was better suited to play second fiddle to actors like Alan Ladd or Joel McCrea.  Hers was a role that needed a Jean Arthur or a Ginger Rogers, both of whom were no stranger to comedy.

To make matters even worse, March and Lake have no on-screen chemistry and, according to legend, their off-screen relationship was anything but cordial.

On the other hand, I MARRIED A WITCH co-stars comedy veterans Robert Benchley and Cecil Kellaway, and when they are on screen the picture really comes to life.

I'm certainly not saying that I MARRIED A WITCH is not entertaining.  It is, if nothing else, a pleasant way to pass 77 minutes.

The new 2K digital restoration from The Criterion Collection features an audio interview with director Clair, the theatrical trailer and it also contains a booklet with an essay by filmmaker Guy Maddin and a 1970 interview with Clair.

Her films stand the test of time and she is always beautifully dressed..Adrian or was it Howard Greer or perhaps it was Edith Head??? Perhaps all 3 of these famous designers were used to make Veronica's costumes...not sure??

In any case, I love her films and her acting. I think she was/is just wonderful. I Married a Witch is cute, funny and just a marvelous film to watch over and over. Frederick March is just too adorable for words, his performance in this film is often disregarded because Veronica was sooo lovely, but he is a cutey too and very high Hollywood.

Veronica Lake is stunning as a witch who puts a curse on the descendants of the judge who convicted her of witchcraft in Puritan New England. Cecil Kellaway is charming. Fredric March plays the descendants from the 17th century until the present day (1942), doomed to suffer miserable marriages. Great sets, great costumes, great hair, great story by the writer of Topper. Lake must have been quite a diva. She and Fredric March loathed one another.

Frederick March's dramatic accomplishment gets no worthy lines. Veronica Lake is well cast, but the direction makes them all look like amateurs, including the support of Robert Benchley.  Cecil Kellaway carries the movie as the witch's bibulous father.

Kellaway is cast as an 800,000 year old warlock burned along with his young daughter on the accusation of March's Puritan ancestor.  But not before the vindictive witch curses her accuser and descendants with bitter marriages.  Comes our time, the evil spirits are released by a lightning strike, and the witch adds to her curse by making the present descdendant love her as she spites him.  But, she drinks the potion by accident.  Her judgmental father must punish her for loving a mortal, but she tricks him into a bottle of rum that she will keep corked.

350691,5,6301706498,"Cecil Kellaway makes I MARRIED A WITCH a scary film indeed, and I suspect that John Huston must have recalled Kellaway's portrayal when he undertook the role of the evil, incest-driven patriarch in Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN.  Against all odds, Kellaway has kept his daughter to himself for 270 years, thanks to the Puritans who have condemned him to live, as a ghost, in the form of smoke, under a giant oak tree on the ancestral property of the Wooley family.  And in turn Kellaway has cursed the Wooleys, ensuring that, in each generation, no man shall find happiness in love, all will be married to plain battleaxes.

Meanwhile Daniel (the warlock played by Kellaway) had Jennifer (his lovely daughter, played by the uniquely talented Veronica Lake) right where he wants her--he's the only man in her universe.  When a lightning storm topples the tree, releasing father and daughter, it spells trouble for Daniel who risks losing the undivided love of his daughter, as, like Miranda in THE TEMPEST, she discovers a brave new world of cute guys and sort of begins to neglect dear old Dad.  Daniel's fury is right out of the Chinatown playbook, and he tries everything he knows to break up Jennifer and her new love interest, Wallace Wooley (Fredric March, looking pretty dumpy only a few years after his killer sex appeal in the Wellman version of A STAR IS BORN).

Some will love Veronica Lake, some will be puzzled, but everyone must admit that in her early scenes, before love makes her more ""human,"" she makes some of the oddest acting choices ever captured on film (Surrealist or otherwise).  She employs a squeaky, oltrano voice, as though entrapment in an oak tree for centuries has blanched away her voice to mere oxygen.  In her memoir, Lake told the story of how French director Rene Clair directed her from moment to moment, coaching and acting out her every phrase and expression, every mincing step.  It is a performance more in bits and pieces than a whole, but it is extraordinary nonetheless.  Readers of VERONICA, Lake's memoir, will also recall that she got tired of Freddie March always feeling her up during their scenes together and she arranged a rocking chair scene in which she managed to steer the rocker part right into his most vulnerable area.

She also had an explosive temper which she unleashed on those bigger than she, in size and power, resulting of course in the destruction of her career... But in her youth these qualities supplied her an electric current that switched a lot of people on...

Veronica resented being known for her long blonde hair, but fame draws on strange things to single out one person for the attention of others: with Bette Davis it was acting; with Crawford it was staring; with Hayworth it was dancing and with Lake it was her silky hair...
