I am going to tell you this film will change your life. The teens ages 15-19 talk about issues that most of us adults are to afriad to speak on. Their passoinate delivers will have you on the edge of your seat. I don't want to spoil any of the movie but their is one poem that touched me the most and that is ""Cruches"". all I have to say is wow. I want you to get this film ASAP! This one is a life changer! Trust me you will want more after it is finished.",1276128000,,604,3.84
3867928,5,B0027PA09M,This DVD is an outstanding example of what reality T.V. could and should be. The series follows several poetry slam competition teams on their way to the Washington D.C. finals. Russell Simmons has presented a great cross section of the talented young people involved. Their coaching sessions and competitve performances will serve as inspiration to youth and adults alike. At times extremely moving; it is always thought provoking. The set includes extra complete performances of edited recitations. I have recommended this to teachers in my area and they are as excited about it as I am! I'd recommend this to their students too! Be aware that there is language and imagery that some may take exception to. I thought it was thrilling!,1256256000,6,736,5.040983606557377
3867929,4,B0027PA09M,I saw this on HBO and I got a few of the extras off itunes. This was a great show. glad to see the youth so passionate  about something and their issues. I remember when I was in high school writing I had no idea a brave new voices existed i don;t even think anyone in my school did either. This set of shows were just awesome and to see these kids in my own city bringing it makes me proud. I wish we saw more inspirational other than just what the news shows.,1255132800,2,461,3.904255319148936
3867930,5,B0027PA09M,"I watched all 7 episodes and even ordered HBO on Demand just to hear these young people from all across the country spit about the various topics affecting their lives.  This was an awesome series and I hope that all the  youths who missed the series are able to get the DVD set. So often we see the youth of America portrayed negatively.  These young poets are definitely role models for other kids. A must see for all, not just youths.",1251676800,9,437,4.37037037037037
3867931,5,B0027PA09M,"Don't be put off by the language, study this and learn from the youth of this country.  This is the way it is in the minds of the youth, probably brought on by us their perents.  Hopefully these kids and others will remember their own youth to pass something better on to their own kids, like we didn't.  Or does it just have to be this way with every generation.",1251244800,2,363,4.1571428571428575

8355022,5,B0027PA09M,"Our student creative writing / spoken word club has really taken inspiration from the heartfelt stories and performances featured. There is some graphic language, but it is appropriate for high school/older teens.",1426204800,,213,5.6875
8355023,3,B0027PA09M,"I liked it, but I think its more appropriate for teens, as the artist are teens themselves and often display emotions in a heightened manner.  It could be an venue for your teen to discover what is a conflict as well as a need for them.  Its can allow your teen to see what is important to other teens and how it affects them.  Just be prepared to walk them through their emotions, as its so fickle, and they might not realize that!  Also, be warned it is a competition but it fits right into  society's ""everyones a winner"" idealogy!",1398038400,,534,4.3
8355024,2,B0027PA09M,"I like the idea of youngsters expressing, emptying their mind but poetry is not what i'd call it. not recommended dvd unless you're really into ... ""poetry""",1387756800,,156,4.814814814814815
8355025,4,B0027PA09M,"Excellent performances but unfortunately I didn't get the disks I wanted. I only received Episodes 1-4. Despite this I enjoyed what I saw immensely. These are some powerful poets, but like some people beneath me, I too was misled.

8355026,4,B0027PA09M,The items came in quickly with no problems. I have watched the video and I plan to have my English students watch them in class to get them introduced to the concept of spoken word and poetry.,1294444800,,192,4.216216216216216
8355027,5,B0027PA09M,"I bought this video to add an audio-visual component to my students' poetry unit.  It did have some profanity, but not so much that they would feel uncomfortable nor anymore than some of them use on a daily basis.  They REALLY enjoyed this video.  It worked out great.  The concepts of tone, mood, & some other literary elements really came to life for them.  I was very pleased.  They were even more excited at the fact that these poets were in their age range.",1287705600,,462,4.440476190476191
8355028,4,B0027PA09M,When I originally bought this I expected it to be straigiht poetry but it is more documentary type. It is a good DVD though,1280707200,,123,4.166666666666667
8355029,3,B0027PA09M,"Received DVD in an ample amount of time but was disappointed when I received the 2nd of a 2 disc set. Per the product description I was suppose to get a 7 part HBO series, instead I got 5-7 parts...no 1-6 parts at all.  Again, I was disappointed because I did not see the Youth Speak group from my immediate area perform.  They would have been in the 1-6 episodes.  Guess I can't complain too much considering how much I paid for the DVD...I just will not use this business in the future because I was given misleading information.",1280275200,,531,4.343434343434343
8355030,4,B0027PA09M,"I LOVE SPOKEN WORD! This was wonderful being that it was a video of our youth reading and writing mindblowing poetry. I loved it! The only problem I had was that this should have been a three disk set instead of two. Reason being is that one of the disk should have been the commentary disk where they could explain all that they had to explain and to detail the lives of the youth and what motivated them to write such poems, and the two other disk should have shown more of them reciting the poems that they were performing. The way it was done, was commentary throughout the whole movie. It was very annoying to try and concentrate on the poetry they were perfoming then being cut short to listen to the commentary.",1278720000,2,718,4.365671641791045
