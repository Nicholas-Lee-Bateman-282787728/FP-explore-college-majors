The most difficult aspect of both these sets is that they are not presented in chronological order-- both seasons are all mixed together, and the finale of the series is in Set 1.  I really wish BFS would do a better job allowing us here in the U.S. to view these series as they were presented originally.
Interesting that in the Filmographies, neither Jennifer Saunders or Dawn French mention their work in the Young Ones.  It'd be nice to get ahold of the older Comic Strip Presents series as well (MTV did show several of those performance pieces.)",1047340800,10,778,4.791044776119403
1799392,1,B00006ZLNO,"Although I loved the cast, the material was WAY beneath their usual brilliant resumes. What a waste. For true fans only. I for one had to get it because I am a fan, but I cannot recommend it in good faith. Good luck.",1047081600,3,216,4.046511627906977

Aiee, his glances...

7973804,5,B00006ZLNO,If you're big French & Saunders fans then you'll like it. It's of it's time but still cracks me up.,1466467200,,99,4.0
7973805,4,B00006ZLNO,"I just can't imagine how this series got away from British television. It's not the smartest sitcom nor does it pretend to be. The rarity is that how many series can count five distinct personalities in 1985 (Tracey Ullman, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, Ruby Wax, and Joan Greenwood) played four unlikely roommates and an eccentric landlady. The late Joan Greenwood was terrific as the eccentric Lady Carlton, their landlady in a Chelsea building.

The four roommates have colorful eccentric and even loud personalities. Dawn French's Amanda is the feminist journalist. Ruby Wax's Shelly Dupont is the American aspiring actress in London. Funny how Shelley came from Los Angeles (Hollywood) and didn't stay there where she probably would have been more successful. Shelly has the money. Saunders played the moody heiress. Ullman plays the blonde roommate.

The two discs only feature eight episodes and no features like a recollection of the short-lived series. It is no surprise why the series was panned by critics. It can be a mess sometimes but it's worth watching for light entertainment and to see four of Britain's rising stars in 1985 before they became Absolutely Fabulous and Ruby's career in broadcasting and Tracey Ullman's own success in America.

I enjoyed Ruby Wax despite her Shelly's obnoxious stereotypical American behavior as loud and overbearing. Her Shelly becomes endearing anyway during the short run.",1449619200,,1427,5.277533039647577

7973807,5,B00006ZLNO,"The series is funny but the writing is dated of course. Great acting and writers. It's great seeing a lot of highly talented people together in one spot at such a young age. Allan Rickman is in the first episode as a sleazy guy. If it hadn't been for his voice and profile, I wouldn't have known. Almost makes me miss the '80's.",1388793600,,328,4.222222222222222
7973808,5,B00006ZLNO,"These girls are very funny. There are not very many episodes. It is not laugh out loud funny, but is it funny. Reminds me a little of the Facts of Life. This is a great show.",1369612800,,174,3.861111111111111
7973809,5,B00006ZLNO,"It was my first time ordering from amazon. I am positively pleased  with the product I purchased and the vendor's speedy shipment. I believe it was about 7 days wait, my dvd arrived in great conditions. Thanks again and I look forward to more purchases from this vendor:)",1281744000,,271,4.645833333333333
7973810,3,B00006ZLNO,"I thought that overall, this series was worth buying.  The sound problem is fixed..for those of you wondering.  As for the series, Ruby Wax's character is the only complaint I have..she was a bit irritating, the series is not laugh out loud funny like Ab Fab, but if your a hardcore Ab Fab or French and Saunder's Fan, then you'll want to add this to your collection.  The episodes and characters grow on you after you watch them a few times.
It's not completely lacking..more of a ""collector's item"" but worth having..but just so you know the episodes are not in order..the company that made this dvd (BFS), is not the brightest..
The dvd quality is fine, the sound is fine, but the picture flickers  a few times here and there..nothing really noticeable except that the same trivia is on set one and two.",1081468800,10,806,4.576388888888889
7973811,4,B00006ZLNO,"Since I'd been hoping to find this show on video or (better) DVD, I was delighted finally to be able to buy the complete series. Other reviews that mention poor quality audio should not concern you: I have both sets and the audio is fine for the age of the program.
Video quality is satisfactory.
If you haven't seen this show, you won't find the sophistication of AbFab, but if you like Rude Girl shows in general this should appeal to you. Ruby Wax is brassy and loud (revealing a lot about her real upbringing, too, if you read her autobiography ""How Do You Want Me?""). Dawn French is bossy, and Jennifer Saunders catatonic. My favourite is the perenially shallow Candice, played by Tracey Ullman.
If female comedy is your thing, you won't be disappointed.",1054252800,5,759,4.62962962962963
7973812,5,B00006ZLNO,"I just want to let you know that these two dvds are great' you get the complete 2 series and although I was worried that the quality was going to be [poor] I can tell you that they are great' they must have sorted out the sound problem that is mentioned in the other reviews' this is a program that I have wanted for ages as I never missed it when it was first shown when I was a kid; all the actresses are well established now and its nice to see them when they where all unknown' anyway they are two dvds that you can buy and if you are a fan then check them out' I highly recomend them (the only problem that I have is that they are not in order but that don't matter they are great and as I said earlier you get all 13 episodes on the two seperate dvds for sale)
The only thing that I don't understand is that they are not avalible in England' this is the only place that I have found them' but who cares Ive got them now.
I hope you enjoy them.
