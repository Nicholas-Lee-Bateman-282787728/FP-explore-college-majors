8212073,3,B000U3LYK2,"NANA 2 (2006) is, at 130 minutes, longer, slower, and sadder than NANA 1 (2005). While the first movie, based on a popular manga about two girls named Nana striking out on their own in Tokyo, was filled with smiles, joy, laughter mixed with tears and tears mixed with laughter, as well as occasional bursts of anger, this one is mostly tears. Both Nanas cry a lot here. Granted, it deals with more serious subjects as the girls grow up and make life-altering decisions, not all of which may seem very wise to the viewer. ""Hachi"" Nana must confront issues of pregnancy, commitment and marriage while rocker Nana has to deal mainly with career choices and some of her own commitment issues, as well as the gnawing feeling of failure at protecting Hachi.

Many fans were dismayed by the decision to recast Hachi with a new actress, Yui Ichikawa. Aoi Miyazaki had that force-of-nature quality that was so prevalent in the manga and which galvanized the rest of the cast and pumped up the first film with humor, cheer and abundant infusions of ""kawaii"" (high cuteness). Hachi seems more beaten down in this one, more passive, reactive rather than proactive. Still, if you liked the characters from the first film, it is quite an emotional journey here for them and I'd say it's worth seeing at least once. Even though she lacks Aoi Miyazaki's sparkle, Yui Ichikawa handles the more intense dramatic requirements of the role well. (Scheduling conflicts reportedly prevented Ms. Miyazaki from returning to the role.) J-rock star Mika Nakashima owns the role of rocker Nana and excels again, especially in the many dramatic scenes.

Again, as with the first movie, there's hardly any music in a story where most of the main characters are rock musicians. There are four songs total, although none of them are played uninterrupted. The one hit song on the soundtrack, ""Hitoiro,"" gets played near the end at an outdoor concert by Nana and her group, the Black Stones, and it plays the longest in what is arguably the best scene in the film, but we have to wait two hours for it. Two of the three earlier songs are performed by Yuna Ito and Trapnest, a rival group. I like the songs here better than those in the first NANA, which I've also reviewed on this site.

This 2-disc edition features a bunch of extras including a ""Making-of"" piece that's 62 minutes long! None of the extras here have English subtitles. One piece, entitled ""New York,"" covers the screening of the film in New York City in December 2006 at which Mika Nakashima and Yui Ichikawa appeared in person and includes English spoken by Mika fans at the post-screening Q&A. I was at that screening and when I looked real hard (the pause and frame-by-frame features come in handy here)--there I was!",1201478400,,2754,4.733333333333333

If you MUST have subtitles, I would wait for another option.
