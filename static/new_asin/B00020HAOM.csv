Even more futile is a bunch of peacekeepers with guns mandated to insure the peace- but directed not to shoot any one. This DVD certainly demonstrated the quagmire the UN peacekeepers found themselves in.",1278633600,,367,4.935483870967742
8019521,5,B00020HAOM,"When i bought this i'd thought it would be stupid.  After i saw it, i thought it was badass.  The music goes with the movie well.  The action is there,  and the acting was overrall good.  If you like blackhawk down, or other well known war movies I would recommend this one. I give it 5 STARS*****",1091318400,5,297,4.140350877192983
