6509401,5,B00LXC8WEK,"""Running for Jim"" has a special place in my heart, and it's a film that I would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with an interest in the indomitable will of the human spirit.

First, I should mention that this film has a special pull for me. I work in the field of ALS research, and it is that devastating disease that Jim Tracy - the central character in the film - is battling over the course of this compelling documentary. I had the privilege of having met him, and the filmmakers, before the film was public. This is the kind of documentary that the ALS community is grateful for, because it captures so many facets of what this disease is about.

But the film is much more than a film ""about ALS"" - or even about one man with ALS. It is more than a film ""about running"" and the determination of championship athletes. ""Running for Jim"" touches on themes that are broader and deeper, such as the compassion that we are capable of displaying when we genuinely care for one another; or what fierce determination can accomplish when we embrace a purpose greater than ourselves or our own self-interest.

By showing a life, and an illness, in some of its most challenging aspects, ""Running for Jim"" also captures the human spirit -- of both a person and a community -- at its best. It's an inspiring film.",1435276800,4,1310,4.518987341772152
6509402,5,B00LXC8WEK,"This is a movie that will grab you, draw you in, turn you inside out and then release you full of renewed belief in the capacity of humans to reach extraordinary heights in their care for those who care about them.

Take one crusty old amazing coach. Mix in a set of high school girl runners who not only can take, but demand 'old school' style coaching. Flip things upside down by the introduction of a terminal disease. And then watch the incredible outcome of a race that hopes to mitigate the inevitable cruelty of a situation that cannot be changed.

Anyone who has ever coached has to see this movie! Anyone who has ever had a great coach has to see this movie! And anyone who does not understand why high school athletics are so much more than wins and losses, has to see this movie!

If great movies are measured by their ability to make you care, to make you feel or to make you think, then this is a great movie. It is funny, incredibly poignant, exciting, illuminating and ultimately powerful in its ability to remind us all just how powerful the relationship between a great coach and young people with all the right stuff can be.

8668718,5,B00LXC8WEK,"Incredible story for anyone who has experienced the value of a coach who cares. The movie does a great job of showing Jim Tracy's impact on his athletes through his humor and his toughness. The respect they have for him is evident, especially as the disease becomes more and more a part of Coach Tracy's life. They will do anything for him. Also welcome is the way the directors are able to educate about ALS beyond Coach Tracy's ordeal without it taking away from the narrative of a coach and his team. Jim Tracy was a wonderfully independent and original man. I was glad to ""meet"" him in this film.",1438041600,5,600,4.463636363636364
8668719,5,B00LXC8WEK,"Deeply Inspiring! Every athletic coach needs to show this movie to her or his team!  This is indeed a movie filled with the challenges of against all odds and the courageous determination of the human spirit!

I am so personally inspired by the story of Coach Jim, struggling heroically with the debilitating effects of ALS, his fierce determination to bring his runners to victory and the story of their fierce determination to win for their beloved coach, diagnosed with devastating ALS.

We hear often the heart-warming, inspiring stores of impoverished, disenfranchised teenagers who rise to athletic glory, winning against staggering odds, through the dedicated efforts of a coach or mentor who believes in them.  The story of Coach Jim Tracy and the students of University High School is a story of a different kind.

When Jim signed on as track coach at University high, he faced the challenge of inspiring privileged teenagers who looked on track & field as more of an exercise than a competition.  His dedication and belief that they could be winners in their own right, his focus of training tuned to each students progress in practice, and his absolute honesty, became that needed inspiration.

Under his direction the University girls cross country team won 12 league titles, 12 North Coast Section championships and 10 state cross-country championshipsthe most in California history. In all he would lead Universitys boys and girls teams to a combined 34 North Coast Section cross-country titles, the most by any NCS coach in any sport. Stricken by ALS, he coached the last two NCS and state crowns from his wheelchair.",1437177600,4,1632,5.067164179104478
