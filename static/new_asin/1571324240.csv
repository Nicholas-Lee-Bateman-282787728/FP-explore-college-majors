188300,5,1571324240,"This first-rate production, which features catchy songs, bright costumes, colorful lighting, to say nothing of the ever-popular circus theme, successfully kept our three and four year olds spellbound, even with repeated viewings. This video does not have an overt educational message, but, as with a circus, it provides a fun break from everyday monotony.",998352000,,355,5.592592592592593
188301,5,1571324240,"We have over 30 Disney videos and other cartoon videos, but this is the only one she cares for.  I was stunned when I saw her sit through the whole movie at 2 1/2.  She's a very active child and nothing would keep her still.  At the end of the tape, she starts wining ""Barney.""  I couldn't believe I was finding myself rewinding and playing this tape six times a day.  It would be more if I hadn't told her that Barney was going to sleep.
The funniest thing is that I wondered why children love him so much, still do...back then I had no children...now my daughter is crazy about him and I'm finding myself buying Barney videos to keep her entertained and let mommy relax a little.",984096000,15,681,4.248062015503876
188302,3,1571324240,"As a parent of two, I guess you could say that I am somewhat of a Barney officianado!!  The premise behind this Barney video is truly wonderful, but poor Barney (with a new voice provider) sounds like he has the worst head cold that a dinosaur has ever experienced.  The two gentlemen taking over Bob West's role have big shoes to fill (no pun intended) and are falling somewhat short of the mark.  The video is nonetheless entertaining, and my 3 year old dances and sings as if nothing were amiss, but I know differently!",982108800,4,522,4.473684210526316
188303,5,1571324240,"This is definitely the Best Barney video yet.  My 18 mo. old son was introduced to Barney by his 2 yr.old cousin.  She watches the circus video at least once a day.  My son is now totally obsessed with Barney.  Compared to other Barney videos, this one has lots of action and keeps his attention with songs and dancing. I enjoy watching it myself.",973555200,3,347,4.375
188304,4,1571324240,"Being a parent, we all want to provide our kids with great educational content that we can easily defend - but this happens to be one DVD that our  daughter loves to watch.
I cannot say it is of much deep educational  value (if you include teeth brushing and sharing, then you might have some  arguement), but for pure entertainment value it's a winner.
Our daughter  loves the costumes and songs - so excited by the circus - we're now on the  search for the real thing.",969235200,,470,4.35632183908046
188305,4,1571324240,Excellent entertainment for children. My 4 years old boy loved the way Barney and his gang where acting at the circus and actually he learned all songs by heart. I myself was charmed by the way imagination is put to work  and was attracted to the screen during all the show. The abilities to use  the DVD additional features enables us to repeat some of the more cheerful  parts of this beautiful production. The sound quality was a little bit  under what we were expecting for such a production and that's why I didn't  go and gave this film a flat 5. But it is one of the best children film I  ever saw and my children would not pass a week without watching this one at  least twice.,962841600,8,685,4.263565891472868
188306,4,1571324240,"My Daughter (2) has watched this several times (more like 5 or 6) since getting it this past weekened - it's only Wednesday - she really seems to enjoy it. She's even getting into some of the actions that go with the  songs. It has replaced her favorite Wiggles video - this is a big deal  since we've been watching Wiggles for weeks. I am always amazed at the sets  and costumes. Barney, for all it's worth, I am grateful that you keep her  entertained and learning.  I'm sure we'll be watching the ""silly  clowns and puppy dogs"" for days on end.",961545600,6,547,4.313725490196078
188307,5,1571324240,"My daughter loves this video, she can watch it over and over and never get  bored with it. Her favorite part is the monkeys when they are singing  ""Boom Boom Ain't It Great To Be Crazy"". This is one of my  favorite Barney videos also. I can watch it over and over, and I do!!!",960681600,5,276,3.981818181818182
188318,5,1571324240,My daughter loved it. She would dance around and sing with the movie. I would recommend buying! And great for the price.,1399939200,,120,4.5
188319,5,1571324240,"We have a Barney addicted 1 1/2 year old granddaughter.  She LOVES all things Barney, and this DVD is included. She can even take the DVD out of it's case, toddle over and put it in the DVD player all by herself...it's kind of crazy lol.

I know some people aren't Barney fans, but the Barney shows teach so many wonderful things, and its such a positive, fun show, I can't imagine her watching Barney is doing any harm. She is even learning colors (although most things are pink :) and she is imitating the songs and dances to a certain extent.

Her parents monitor her tv watching closely, so she doesn't overdo, but boy, she would if she could. I think she would have Barney playing round the clock if her parents let her. Great tape--just wished they were still making more Barney shows...",1388620800,2,793,4.455172413793103
188320,5,1571324240,Our son has worn out at least two of these DVD's so we ordered 2 more.  He loves them and plays them every night.  Barney is good for all children especially those who have special needs as our children do.,1387843200,,206,4.125
188321,4,1571324240,Not as nicely made as the first I bought. This copy/edition seems to be of cheaper quality as the original I bought close to 10 years ago.,1384905600,,138,4.148148148148148
188322,5,1571324240,"Granddaughter, age 2, loves this movie!
Way to go, Barney!  A good, entertaining movie for little ones.  She can watch over and over.",1383177600,,133,4.739130434782608
188323,5,1571324240,Great movie we watch it through amazon prime which is a fabulous idea if you don't belong to prime you should join,1380844800,,114,4.2272727272727275
188324,5,1571324240,My little girl loves this video...she is 1 1/2 and is starting to really dance and march along with the kids in this video,1372291200,,122,4.125
188325,5,1571324240,One of my 18 month old daughters favorities!... She loves Barney in general but this is a GREAT one!.  Holds her attention.,1360713600,2,123,4.590909090909091
188326,3,1571324240,this is not what i expected.. too many real kids putting on an act and it repells me..  but little ones will be o.k. with watching other kids. there does not seem to be much singing and dancing.. and not of barney in it either.. he pops in and out on real kids shenigians. im sure a 4 or 5 yr. old would like it better then me and my great grandaughter..,1355443200,,354,3.9166666666666665
188327,5,1571324240,This is  a great resource for teaching.  I am a special education teacher and I have a downs syndrome student.  He loves this video and watches it over and over.  Great for the imagination and very entertaining.,1350518400,,211,4.621621621621622
188338,5,1571324240,"My 3 year old loves this particular Barney show and I am happy to watch it along with my son as well. Very talented kids, excellent clowns, good music, a lot of humor. My son particularly cherishes the ""roar"" joke as well as the Boom Boom song. Highly recommended.",1338336000,,264,4.408163265306122
188339,3,1571324240,"This DVD is 50 minutes long.  Most of it takes place at the same location, as the characters are putting on a circus.  There is a lot of singing and dancing, which my 2-year-old daughter loves.  Boring for me, but my daughter enjoys it.",1322524800,,236,4.318181818181818
188340,5,1571324240,This is by far the best Bareny video that we have (and we have a lot)!  I'm not even tired of it yet :-),1191196800,,104,3.3333333333333335
188341,5,1571324240,This item is vertually impossible to find in stores. We tried for 5 years toreplace the tape we once had and this is the only place we could find it!!,1187913600,,150,4.033333333333333
188342,4,1571324240,my three year old daughter loves this DVD. it is extremely entertainig and keeps her glued to the TV. she especially likes the music. the songs are new and different.she just cant get enough of it. my two year old loves it as well.,1156723200,,231,4.2727272727272725
188343,3,1571324240,This was just OK for us. There was a lot of talking and it lost the interest of my 18 month old. It starts out in the treehouse and then moves to the imaginary circus (that is where it gets better) but even that did not hold his attention because of the long spaces between songs. The saving grace of the DVD is that there is a menu option for 'sing along' and it just plays all the songs back to back. If you want less talking try Colorful World Live show. Our favorite by far!,1108684800,,478,3.9895833333333335
188344,5,1571324240,I got this for my daughter in Spanish and she loves it.  I was kind of doubtfull at first thinking that she might not like that Barney spoke with a different voice but the songs are great and it's full of non-stop dancing.  Even though she already has it in Spanish I would buy it again in English if she wanted. Not as annoying as the regular TV episodes.,1035936000,,356,4.144927536231884
188345,1,1571324240,"Kids and Barney talk most of the time.
Sing the same old songs they do in other shows.
They take more time to show the preparation for the show then the actual show (circus). Then, when they finally show you the circus, it is plain boring to watch. They sing, primarily, their old songs and dress in costumes. That is it!
It is not funny or entertaining, I had to fast forward through it most of the time.
I cannot understand how other people had rated it with more than 1 star?? Must be the promoters.",1034467200,5,502,4.239583333333333
188346,5,1571324240,this was a good time cassete!! men and children may enjoy and find fun for both adges! you are be found to sing songs whilst driving a car later. verry goode! many than 5 stars!,1013126400,2,177,4.085714285714285
188347,3,1571324240,"It is colorful. It is a fun hour to spend with the big purple guy. But that is it. There is zero educational value (except what a circus is like) and Kristin and Kim, two of the kids on the video, are looking a little grown up to me. They just don't fit. (sorry girls!)
Some of the songs are repeats from ""More Barney Songs"" but they are well produced. It is entertaining, but lacking what some of the other Barney DVD's have to offer.",1010966400,13,435,4.129411764705883
