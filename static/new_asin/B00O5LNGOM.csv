6724884,5,B00O5LNGOM,"Robert Johnson, best known of the Delta blues singers, synthisized a personal style out of the raw country blues of Son House and the urban stylings of Lonnie Johnson.  His lyrics made him the Delta's Poet Luareate.  There are several Johnson lessons out there but with all respect to other instructors, Tom Feldman would be my go-to choice for getting into Johnson.  First, its comperhensive. Tom covers all of Johnson's recorded numbers, breaking down his many variations in A std and bottleneck moves in open G, then going on to cover his  ocassional forays into Drop-D (Malted Milk), Vestapol (Preaching Blues) and Crossnote (Hellhound on my Trail) tunings.  Secondly, Tom explains everything clearly and in detail, first walking you through the structure of a song, the working in the variations, all clearly shown by SGGW's excellent production. Impressive.  Helps to have some fretboard knowledge and fingerpicking ability.",1417132800,7,930,5.292517006802721

8682292,5,B00O5LNGOM,"Ive been playing guitar for over 25 years and recently got into Robert Johnson. I got this set and I cannot recommend it enough. Ive seen a lot of how to guitar lessons on video and for this style of music, it cant be beat. Within days I was able to incorporate the new techniques into my own playing and learned 2 songs.

Tom Feldmann is an excellent teacher and these videos are not only informative, but also entertaining as he plays the songs for you.

Only video series that rivals his teaching is Paul Gilberts - but that is more for hard rock and metal.

Feldmann gives you the tools you need to play all of Johnsons songs. Much more fun to play along with him.

Also, the DVD comes with tabs on pdf to all the songs covered. I actually prefer these tabs to the Robert Johnson songbook I bought. They aren't as meticulous but the thing is, once you get the idea of the songs, they tend to fall into place on their own. The RJ songbook is so detailed that it makes getting the basics of the songs harder.

If you are really intent on learning Robert Johnsons guitar style, this DVD set will get you there while having fun doing it!

Very well done and highly recommended!",1509408000,,1177,4.2792792792792795

8682295,5,B00O5LNGOM,Tom Feldman is a great instructor really like his style and take on Robert Johnson he is easy to follow as far as getting Johnson down there is only one Robert Johnson and he lets you know that. He points you in the right direction and its up to you to make it your own. One of the best instructional dvds I own!,1472947200,,312,3.9682539682539684
8682296,5,B00O5LNGOM,"This is by far my favorite Robert Johnson instructional. Tom Feldmann breaks down the songs in more detail than any other instructional DVD out there. One reviewer complained it's not ""step by step""...well it almost is but to actually go step by step would take 40 hours. What Tom doesn't go through step by step you can pick up by using the split screen and slowing down the playback speed (although I never found this necessary and I'm an intermediate player) as well as using the included tab. Tom also gives some cool insights into the folks who influenced Robert Johnson's playing (Son House, Charley Patton, etc.) This is just a fantastic instructional, it will change your life!",1460332800,3,685,4.813559322033898
8682297,5,B00O5LNGOM,"My mom bought me this for Christmas. (not from Amazon) Im now very close to being able to play every damn song RJ recorded. Already having some open tuning and slide experience is a definite plus but in any case, if you spend 30 minutes a day with one of the discs, its going to make its way to your fingers. Id play along and get the general outline though I would initially gloss over some of the more complicated bits. With every subsequent pass, Id pick up more of the demonstrated techniques. Stick with a disc until you have those tunes down.  Move to the next one. Review, repeat. Tom has got it going on.",1457654400,4,612,4.275862068965517
8682298,5,B00O5LNGOM,"This is a great dvd. If you like blues, and want to learn how to play them, then this is a great place to work on them. It will help if you are already familiar with guitar though, as this seems to be for people who've played guitar for awhile. He breaks down the songs of Robert Johnson clearly. It would be useful for beginners as well, if they'd like to know more about blues structure.",1456099200,3,389,4.131578947368421
