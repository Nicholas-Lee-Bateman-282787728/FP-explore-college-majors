2690964,5,B000KGGJ04,"I will only review one of the films: Black Widow. This is one of those brilliant films which does not get as much recognition as it should. The performances of Winger and Russell are captivating, as well as those of the relatively minor characters. The setting and the dialogue also add to a flawless piece of work.

Synopsis: Winger, an ambitious federal agent, doing paperwork on a Mafia boss' death, and sick of her desk job, becomes intrigued with Ondine's Curse, a painless, nonviolent, death that occurs when sleeping. She then stumbles on a couple of similar cases where the now-wealthy widow suddenly disappears afterwards. She follows up several leads. One of them goes to Seattle, where she meets a potential victim, a good, shy, and kind wealthy newly married anthropologist. He dies soon thereafter and Winger blames herself for his death. She then follows the black widow to Hawaii to her next victim. The rest I leave up to the viewer in order not to spoil the movie further.

Both women are portrayed as being very intelligent and driven. Winger is at first obsessed with leaving her desk job and later in catching the black widow. Russell is a master (mistress?) manipulator (who could have been a chess champion), but who nonetheless is ""cracked."" She repeatedly states that she truly, honestly, loved all her previous husbands and her facial expressions accent her declarations. And, although calculating, she momentarily goes berserk whenever she realizes that somebody is on her trail.",1335398400,3,1505,5.016
2690965,3,B000KGGJ04,"Of these two films in one package, Black Widow is the better drama.  It's a mystery in the classic style.  The guilt of the killer (played to the hilt by a sultry Theresa Russell) is not in question.  The issue is how the investigator (Debra Winger) will catch her, after tracking her across the country.  The plot is clever, the narrative moves along nicely, and the direction by veteran Bob Rafelson features some beautiful visuals, particularly after the action moves from the Pacific Northwest to Hawaii.  By comparison, the Vanishing is a remake of a European film, with some differences in the plot.  The events are, however, curiously implausible.  Distraught after the disappearance and apparent death of his girlfriend (a then-unknown Sandra Bullock), Kiefer Sutherland makes sustained efforts to find the killer, only to fall under his spell when he finally meets the murderer in person.  In sum, Black Widow works well; The Vanishing falls short.",1276041600,8,957,5.089743589743589
2690966,5,B000KGGJ04,"My copy DOES have the full-screen/wide-screen options and both are working fine - wish all dvd's had this choice.  Two great movies, if you enjoy thrillers, at a great price!",1233273600,6,174,4.8
2690967,3,B000KGGJ04,"Claimed to be in both full and wide screen. But, not so. Either side is full screen!",1201392000,9,84,4.0
2690968,4,B000KGGJ04,"This is an excellent double set. Both are excellent thrillers. In ""The Vanishing"" while Keifer Sutherland and his fianc Sandra Bullock are at a gas station she suddenly disappears. He believes she is kidnapped and searches relentlessly for three years before beginning another life with a new lady played by Nancy Travis. When he is about to completly give up on his previous girlfriend, the kidnapper contacts him. Beau Bridges is effective as the scientific kidnapper that is merely conducting a deadly experiament. His family life can not keep him happy enough so as a scientist he must try something against the laws of good. After Sutherland meets him it looks like he will meet his fiancs same fate. His life hangs on the fact his new girlfriend has followed him and taken the kidnappers daughter for a ride. What happens next is very suspenseful. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""Breakdown"".

In ""Black Widow"" Theresa Russell is effective as a woman that marries wealthy men and then disposes of them in clever ways that look like normal deaths.  A detective played by Debra Winger starts suspecting the string of deaths when she finds an unusual blood test from one. She relentlessly tracks Russell but can't prove anything. When she finally trails her to Hawaii she gets overly zealous and gets to close to the next victim to be. She then gets herself into trouble with the law and thrown into jail trying to prove Russell's guilt when he is killed. How will she prove her own innocence and the Widows guilt? I recommend this DVD set. It is a good value. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""American Gigolo"".

8156684,4,B000KGGJ04,"THE VANISHING (1993)

Directed by George Sluizer from a novel by Tim Krabb, The Vanishing is a crime drama/mystery/horror about a man (Kiefer Sutherland) whose girlfriend goes missing during a trip in Washington State (Sandra Bullock) and he searches in vain for her for years. After he starts a relationship with a new girlfriend (Nancy Travis), the abductor (Jeff Bridges) finally contacts him. Will he find his former girlfriend?

This is the second time the director shot this same story; the first time was the 1988 Euro film of the same name. The stories are identical except for the final acts and the fact that this newer version has a better character/part for the new girlfriend (Travis). Both films are worth catching, but I prefer this one for reasons explained below. Fans of the first movie object to the changes, arguing that the producers of this version were pandering to North American tastes. While this may be true, its also likely that the director didn't want to make the same exact movie. After all, we already have the first version, why make an exact duplicate with different actors and locations? Besides, whats wrong with appreciating BOTH versions? My comments below reveal why Sluizer wanted to change things up a little with this version.

Audiences may have rejected the film at the box office on the grounds that they weren't used to Bridges playing a contemptible villain or Sutherland playing the good guy, but they're both fine in these roles, particularly the former, whos great and fascinating to observe. One thing that keeps you watching during the drama of the first two acts is to find out what his motivations are. But, as hinted above, its Travis who steals the show, at least as far as protagonists goes. Perhaps audiences didn't receive her or the movie well because her characters merely a waitress whose story arc doesnt end in a reversal of fortune, which is in contrast to the typical movie heroine. Who knows? I think shes awesome.

In any case, if you like psychological drama/thrillers like Fatal Attraction (1987) and Single White Female (1992) youll appreciate The Vanishing.

The movie runs 109 minutes and was shot mostly in Washington State, but also Cody Tunnel, Cody, Wyoming (the tunnel sequence) and La Canada and Long Beach, CA (the diner and pool hall scenes respectively).

GRADE:  B+

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further unless youve watched the movie)

While the first film could be interpreted as a commentary on nihilism, since the villain wins and the hero loses, it doesnt HAVE to be interpreted this way. After all, its a simple fact of life that sometimes evil wins a battle now and then; and sometimes A LOT of them, but this doesnt mean evil wins the war, so to speak. If theres ultimate good then evil will eventually have its day of reckoning.

In any event, the 1988 movie ends on a decidedly downbeat note. And this is why I appreciate this newer version: While it is also downbeat, and evil wins to a point, the changes in the final act show good triumphing over evil, not to mention perseverance over intellect and love over absence of love. The subtext is all about freewill  freewill to kill for no good reason and freewill to kill for good when absolutely necessary. The theme of the first movie is limited in that it drives home the first point whereas this version drives home both, and is the better for it.

***END SPOILER***

=========================

BLACK WIDOW

Released in early 1987 and directed by Bob Rafelson from Ronald Bass screenplay, Black Widow stars Debra Winger as a federal investigator who goes after a gold-digging femme fatale (Theresa Russell) who moves from husband to husband, killing them and collecting the inheritance. Sami Frey plays a French lothario living in Hawaii, a target of the Black Widow and potential love interest of the heroine. Dennis Hopper and Diane Ladd have small parts.

The plot is akin to Columbo in that we know who the murderer is right away and its just a matter of the sleuth cleverly catching him or her. At first, I thought Winger was a newspaper reporter, but by the second half it becomes evident that shes a government agent. They shoulda been clearer on this.

This is one of those movies I can take or leave. I acknowledge its good points and enjoy it when I see it, but theres not enough oomph to make it a must-see. Like Columbo, the plot is decidedly made-for-television, but the location shooting distinguishes it as a theatrical film. Winger makes for a fine heroine and there are little things thrown in that smack of real-life, which I appreciate, like the poker game at the office and the colleagues mild flirtations with the protagonist. Russell has the requisite looks that kill, but whatever body double they used for the naked buttocks scene lacked any curves to get excited over.

Nevertheless, if you appreciate 80s period pieces, film noir and the two stars, Black Widow is worth catching, just don't expect greatness.

The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in Seattle, DC and Hawaii.
