This film is nothing like the anime. It's bad on so many levels that I wasn't sure I was even watching the same anime brought to live-action.
As example, skip this and watch the anime of the Death Note series, and then watch the live-action film versions (2) of the same title.
Where Death Note is a 10 for both versions, this live-action version of 'Leapt' is a -10. It makes me want to watch the original anime again to wipe this film from my memory (time travel;).",1487808000,,704,4.595238095238095

4894212,4,B005UNI2U2,"I haven't seen the anime yet, so no comparative expectations here!  The reason I was interested in this was due to two factors: (1) The highly rated 'Girl who leaped through time' anime and (2) I lived in Japan for 2-years, and was a pleasant reminder of how much I adored the the Country, Culture and the People of Japan.  If it wasn't for these reasons, I would probably not have been interested.  The conversations of characters is a prime example of the people and culture.  Folks with no Japan experience may not recognize and follow the quirk-e-ness of the Japanese.  As some have noted, this is not a sci-fi film, but essentially a chick-flick (due note before you invest 2-hrs).  I did enjoy it, and the subtitles (via steaming) were well paced and transferred from Japanese to English in 'simple form'.  Jap to English does not translate 100% - so conversations tend to be boring and flat (at time).",1486425600,,908,4.6375

Rating = ***
Director:  Masaaki Taniguchi
Producers:  Iwao Abe et al.
Streaming
2010

Film = three (3) stars; subtitles = four (4) stars;  cinematography = 3.5 stars; CGI/effects = three (3) stars.  Director Masaaki Taniguchi's tale is crafted to appeal to a much broader audience than what the usual teenage chick flick targets.  Taniguchi cleverly blends romance, science fiction, comedy, heart-rendering emotional drama, and suspense.  (Mercifully, there are no scenes of Japanese cuteness!)  One of the Director's objectives is to illustrate just how messy time travel can be (except for ants?) due to the creation of alternative time lines, and, especially, when it involves teenagers from different times who happen to meet up and share a romantic adventure.  Leading actress Riisa Naka's performance is a tour de force of emotional highs and lows.  Supporting cast members are also very good with the possible exception of the actor who stiffly plays a memory-wiping, bland character from five hundred years in the future (what ever romantic appeal he might have had as a real/virtual teenager in the 1970s seems to have been lost in time!).  Cinematography (semi-wide screen, color) is good but could benefit from a deep-focus process where both background and foreground can be clearly seen simultaneously (the back and forth shift in the camera's focus during close-ups can be distracting and lessen the impact of dialog exchanges).  Within and between scene lighting is good.  Music is a bit on the heavy side for such a minor picture (it would seem to be more suitable for a larger-scale production?).  CGI/effects  are modest, but not cheesy.  Subtitles strike an excellent balance between literal and literary translations.  They are just right in length and screen duration.  However, song lyrics are not translated.  Recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1479254400,,1989,5.287539936102236

I lack knowledge or experience to judge how well that last element was handled--wondered about a couple of possible anachronisms--and I wanted an even more meaningful and satisfying ending, but would still recommend this film to friends.",1478390400,2,519,5.117647058823529

4894243,5,B005UNI2U2,"I went into watching this movie not knowing anything about the manga/anime that is is supposedly based upon (later I would read that it is a totally different storyline), but figured it would be light hearted and whimsical.

That assumption was incorrect, but I was totally happy about it.  The construct of the movie involves time travel, but in the context of the discovery of complex personal connections and star crossed love.  That's about as much as I can try to describe it while not specifically giving away any of the story (and even then I feel like I've given away too much).

The acting is great, and while some feel the pace of the movie is slow, that's just how it works with japanese cinema. If you really take the time, you will very much appreciate how the 'slow' places in the movie are definitely designed to be that way, and it adds to the emotional build up.

I haven't watched that many Japanese movies lately, but this definitely makes me happy to have seen, the emotional build up and pay off at the end is heartfelt.",1467331200,9,1041,4.51595744680851

4894248,4,B005UNI2U2,"The movie is about as deep as Back to the Future.  In fact the story is not really a lot different than that old Michael J. Fox film.  The dialogue, of course, is in Japanese, but it had English sub-titles when I saw it.  The cinematography and the acting are so outstanding that I have no hesitation in recommending it to others.  I enjoyed the film from start to finish, except for the brief episode when the title character makes her leap through time.  It was absurdly campy the way it was handled.  But even so, that one scene was not enough to spoil the entire film for me.  Risa Naka, by the way, is an amazing actress.  I hope to see her again on the screen soon.",1464566400,5,671,4.1875
4894249,5,B005UNI2U2,"I cried a few tears. I'll admit it, tears of compassion for the main character. I've only cried during two other movies other than this one. One of those was Titanic, when Jack sacrificed his life for Rose, and the other was the Scene in Forest Gump when Jennie was trying to explain her feelings to Forest after throwing rocks at her father's house. This movie has lots of aspects I like, such as Time Travel,Alchemy,futurism,a deep and well explained story line, and a lot of heart and emotion.

Just like the current fad of live action remakes of Marvel characters, the Japanese equivalent can be made equally as bad. Our main heroine is cute, but it looks like that could not overcome her lack of talent. Pretty much bad acting across the board; at least it was all on the same level. A case reinforcing that most voice actors should probably stay in front of a mike -- unless its just for blatant fan service, of course.

4894266,5,B005UNI2U2,The screenplay isn't very surgical. It has many logic holes that keep you from getting fully into the story. The tempo is on slow side which is rather typical with Japanese films. Nonetheless the main character Riisa Naka plays Akari really well and the romantic story of her at the destination of time travel is good enough reason to watch. The setup of Japan's 70s was very realistic and nostalgic. Recommendable to those who care for alternatives to Hollywood glamour.,1451001600,2,471,4.9
4894267,5,B005UNI2U2,"I think the one thing lacking from the other reviews about this movie is to say that the plot of this movie has nothing to do with the anime.

It is a little slow in parts, but if you watch a lot of these kinds of movies, you come to expect that. Otherwise, it was a very enjoyable two hours, especially for something that is Free on Amazon Prime.",1448582400,16,486,4.170212765957447

If you're a science fiction fan, a nihongophile, or just an enjoyer of off-beat romantic movies, this is a great way to spend some time.",1448409600,,435,4.2926829268292686

4894294,5,B005UNI2U2,"Riisa Naka is charming, sweet, and adorable in this sentimental SF film.

The scene where she sheds a tear without knowing why was a nice touch (and it felt strikingly similar to Honoka Miki in the role of Aihara Kotoko in Itazura na Kiss where she also sheds a single tear without exactly understanding why).

Yes, it's a bit slow at times, and it reprises a lot of themes that appear in other time travel movies (especially the ""go back in time, meet your parents when they were younger"" one that so often makes an appearance - for example, in 'Back to the Future'), but it makes up for that with a storyline that lets you savor the ache of lost experiences and missed opportunities.",1437177600,,685,4.472

I like the film for one reason, two fell in love that they knew that relationship could not continue.  That happened to me, not the time traveling, but fell for someone that was so much younger than me.  There were to  many differences.

The subtitles were a pain in the beginning but I got use to that.  I did not read all but when the film got interesting.  One has to be patient.  There is several places in the film that is very boring.",1436832000,,545,4.02803738317757

4894298,5,B005UNI2U2,"I had seen a preview of the movie and had it on the wish list. I finally had some time and decided to watch the movie.

At first I thought I made a mistake as it started out with Japanese racing much faster than the sparse English subtitles. There was background sound that did not match the pictorial scenes. For the first ten minutes or so I was sure I made a mistake. Then the movie and the acting and the story started to show through. I completely forgot that I was reading subtitles. I started kibitzing. Many stories are very transparent and you can anticipant the next step. This one was fresh at every turn.

A woman (Narumi Yasuda) who invents a time travel liquid finds herself in a coma from an accident. She gains consciousness just long enough to send her teenage daughter Akari Yoshiyama (Riisa Naka) on a mission from 2010 to 1972 to hold a chemistry student Masamichi Hasegawa (Munetaka Aoki) to his promise.

4894301,2,B005UNI2U2,"This came as a disappointment to me. I like time-travel films, as a rule, but TIME TRAVELLER was too kitschy for me to suspend disbelief. The CGI is amateurish, almost as bad as the Ed Woodish movie-within-a-movie depicted in the story line. Riisa Naka is wonderful as the 18-year-old leading character, an adorably buoyant teenager who is also able to register true anguish when the situation demands. Worst of all, for me, was one scene that seemed to be mistakenly edited in from another film entirely. It involves Akira's first meeting of hippie cameraman Hasegawa""Gotetsu"" Masamichi (Aoki Munetaka). All of a sudden, this family-friendly movie is discussing a hard-on/boner and using the word sh! t, right in front of sweet Akira. What in the world was the director thinking here? That killed it for me, and I lost all respect for TIME TRAVELLER's endearing sense of innocence. The movie is not disastrous, but neither would I recommend investing more than two slow hours of your lifetime to it.",1434758400,,1000,4.958333333333333

It was slow with a really good build up that just fizzled out in the end. My feeling is this the first of a trilogy or some kind of film school project from a good director.

There is some romance involved, and of course, science fiction. The plot of the story was overall good in my opinion. It made me more curious to read the novel and watch the other movies based off of it.
However, all I ask for everybody is to not have big expectations of it and just go with the story. I was probably disappointed that it wasn't similar to the anime that I have always watched. By then, I learned that this and the anime's story are loosely based on the novel, so don't get any big expectations. Appreciate the story as it's own.",1424390400,2,714,4.107142857142857

4894330,3,B005UNI2U2,"I liked the original, anime version somewhat better- though not a great film, it was faster paced and more exciting, suspenseful.  This moves slowly- an hour long story seemed drawn out to two.  There were aspects I liked a lot- the look of the 70s decor, the attention to detail.  The lead actress is believable, winsome (all the acting was good, if understated).  But for me, this wasn't a tight enough time travel story and that marred it for me, along with the fact that it was so different from the original, which I ordered from Amazon UK years ago.  Why give it the same name??  The plot is utterly different.  Here, the relationship is the core of the tale.

There's something I find almost magical and soothing about some Japanese anime and anime-inspired films- I think it has to do with innocence and utter sincerity (combined with the music)- a relaxing breath of fresh air and very different indeed from American films, especially those featuring young people.  Hayao Miyazaki's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>&nbsp;is one of my favorite films, and this one, too, has moments of tenderness and charm.

I tend to not like foreign films much because I am used to American-quality films-and it's easy to notice how the camera angles and shots are bouncy or shaky or just strange in foreign films. I quickly became immersed in the story however, and ended up really liking this movie. I suggest you all to give this a shot, especially if you are just venturing into the world of foreign films, because it does a very good job with story, characters and sound. I will admit that they overplayed their soundtrack-though it wasn't open to many options, so I have to give that a shot. The second half was exceedingly well done, and I was very pleased with this. I hope to find more foreign films that are as good as this one was.

In case you didn't read the title-THIS IS NOT LIKE THE ANIME. The mother, I would assume is supposedly the protagonist in the anime film, and while she isn't necessarily the main character, she does play an interesting role.

This is loosely based on the anime, perhaps attempting to be a sequel of sorts.  As with Japanese (vs. American-style) movies, it was more deliberate, not flashy and definitely character-driven.  That was fine.  There were a few parts that beg you to throw away what is realistic and jump into this fantasy with both feet.  Otherwise you couldn't get through some parts.  I personally hated what she found her father to be and how he treated her, esp. at the end.  Only a handful of scenes I would say were humorous, quite unlike the anime. And the movie that was being directed (a character was filming a movie), I just didn't get it.  Maybe it was symbolism for what was happening to the characters, but I just don't get it.  Maybe if I was Japanese I would know a bit more of what it all meant (cherry blossoms being apart of it).  Anyway, it was ok.  If I had known a bit more I probably would have skipped it, nothing esp. stood out for me in this movie except being able to hear the lovely Japanese language for 2 hours straight!  ...and of course it was -somewhat- like the anime I thoroughly enjoyed in the past.",1390780800,,1416,4.286792452830189
4894364,3,B005UNI2U2,"I guess this is a re-re-re-make of an original movie from 1983. The original story was written in 1966, so it predates ""Back to the Future"". The storyline of this movie is modernized to 2010, and the main character goes back to good old 70s.",1389571200,,241,4.377777777777778

4894366,5,B005UNI2U2,This film was excellent. It has lots of emotional ups and downs and an excellent story. I was very moved by it. I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking a good romantic adventure. Naka Riisa does a wonderful job in it.,1386806400,7,226,4.404761904761905
4894367,5,B005UNI2U2,"I'm glad that Amazon had this movie as part of their Prime Instant Video.  I normally only watch Japanese anime, but I loved this live action film.  I'm not a crazy movie buff, but I enjoyed the different feel of the movie and how the story was told.  The acting was as good as any film I've seen made by Hollywood.  I only wish it was dubbed in English versus subtitled.  I'm not going to say much about the story cause I don't want to ruin it for anyone that hasn't read the book.  If you get a chance, watch this movie.  Make sure you have some tissue handy.",1383955200,,561,4.091743119266055
4894368,5,B005UNI2U2,"... because your heart remembers someone whom you loved and who was erased from your memory.

This is the best summary I can think of for this movie. It is apparently a comedy but it hurts a lot seeing the girl desperately screaming and running after a speeding bus and being powerless to change the fate of the one she loves... And all of this just to be left with no memory of the tender love she'd had for a short while...

I haven't seen the anime version of this story, but after watching this live movie, I kept wishing there was a sequel to that, in which she could somehow remember the one she loves.

The story goes slow at the beginning but when you are about to stop watching it, it hooks you up and you cannot stop until it ends. And you are left wanting more... Wondering what would happen now for she was brought back to her time without taking the second dose of the elixir her mother developed to travel through time. So, in theory, she could still jump back in time and meet him again.

Even with all the spoilers in this review, I still would encourage you to watch this movie. It is worth it.",1382832000,,1111,4.226415094339623
4894369,4,B005UNI2U2,Enjoyable story that makes you pay attention. You must also be able to read the story line unless you speak and understand Japanese.

4894370,4,B005UNI2U2,"I was engrossed throughout the movie. The surprises came at the right moment. Twist and turns not too great a leap, just enough to cause a moment of confusion then enjoyment at the reveal. But like all Japanese Manga / anime / movies, they all end like an Italian Opera; those you like die and the rest move sadly along with their lives. This one has them doing so blissfully unaware of the events they just experienced.",1379721600,,420,4.467532467532467

Not so.  The movie is very slow, and the acting is at best OK.  The story itself is not a bad story at all.  Had there been a better director, better acting, better camera work, better pacing of the movie, this could have been another good time travel movie.",1371686400,2,436,4.481012658227848

4894379,5,B005UNI2U2,"What is primarily different in American and Japanese storytelling is that the story itself IS the most important element...PERIOD.

If you're looking for special effects, it's actually got a few that are sublime, such as the timecode for freezing the elements within a frame-but I digress.

What's also important within this genre is the emotive response of each of the main characters as the story unfolds; the plot twists are intended to keep you moving along, but not give away the ending.

I won't spoil it. But what I will tell you is that once again, there is a fantastically complicated emotional story that's sporting a bittersweet ending that's fitting the scheme of the writer's original intent.

The director made the film as if he really wanted to tell the story the way it was written...isn't that worth the price of admission?

While the video quality may not be stellar, it's the story that's important.

Perhaps what's also really great here is how the minglings of humor, sarcasm, and pure ingenuity leave you saying, ""Wow, I didn't see that one coming...""

Akira's development from a girl celebrating her 18th birthday, to watching herself walk through the cherry blossoms is nothing short of a transformation of your perception of her.",1366848000,31,1254,4.971291866028708

4894381,3,B005UNI2U2,"This movie is one of those that left me feeling unsatisfied. I was re-writing the story as it went. It ended up feeling like a TV movie to me. This movie could have been great but fell short for me. The story never let the love story grow, it cut it off prematurely and was over the top sad. It did get my creative juices flowing though, makes me want to go and write my own fictional story.",1363046400,,391,4.0256410256410255

4894385,5,B005UNI2U2,"I love the concept of the original story called ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" by Yasutaka Tsutsui (the book from which this movie jumps off). I've read the book and seen the manga version of ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" that was released in 2006.

Unlike the anime, the protagonist in the movie doesn't play around much. She is on a mission to find someone from her mother's past. There are, of course, complications, but what good story doesn't have any? The movie has a really good ending, but I wouldn't necessarily classify it as happy. That's one key way in which Japanese movies can differ from American ones.

As another reviewer said, the quality isn't perfect, but I think the story and the acting is good enough that watching this movie is totally justified. There are plot twists that I never saw coming, and it kept the movie very interesting. I highly recommend it!",1347408000,24,887,4.643312101910828

8486969,2,B005UNI2U2,"Spoiler review:
Time Traveller or ""Your Soulmate Probably Died A Long Time Ago: The Movie"", has a lot of problems. Directionally, and cinematographically the lense spends way too much focus on close ups of the protagonist, Akari. By the way, they try to sell her as a high school student, and while she is indeed youthful, she is clearly closer to her 20s or mid-20s. I admit, she is a good looking girl, but the time spent with the lens lingering on her face and mouth are bordering on obsession. The lighting and shoots is particularly low budget, mirroring the directorial ambitions of the past-romeo, Ryota.  So there is some weak meta-meaning sloppily hidden there. The story is unexpectedly, but delightfully grim, with its ultimate message of the past being unable to reverse itself and that as we look upon past tragedies in humanity, we can only do so as observers. This is where the film fails to execute on its message, Akari towards the end has her memories wiped, erasing all that she has learned about the past and the futility of mortality. As we observe the past, we are able to carry with us the ability to know how to move forward, whereas Akari will not be able to. What then, was the point of the movie without the character developing in any meaningful way? The movie attempts to band aid this by adding a retrospective scene of Akari being moved by an old reel of the very same movie she had shot with Ryota, whom we have learned perished in an accident prior to Akari returning to present time. We already know she has had her mind wiped, with the implication that her mother has experienced similar treatments by ""time agents""(I have no other name to describe them). Long story short, the movie has a good message, but fails in its execution, yet it is a message nonetheless and that deserves an additional star.  I have seen the anime, which is a different story with different characters, but set within the same universe. This is not a romantic-comedy ala Blast From The Past:Anime Edition with unrealistic and longstanding expectations for a person to wait for their lover to be born(creepy). Yes, I am saying the anime had its own problems despite the animation itself to be substantial as an art piece.",1499126400,,2232,4.66243654822335

This is the story of the daughter of the original girl who leapt through time (but you don't need to have seen or read the first storyline to watch this).

I think one of the coolest parts is it kind of has a happy ending - 5 years after this movie was made, the 2 main characters got married in real life.  The chemistry was real :)",1495843200,,559,3.9642857142857144
