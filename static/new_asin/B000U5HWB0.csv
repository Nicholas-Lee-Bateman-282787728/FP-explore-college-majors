First off this video is only thirty minutes long which may be a that big of a deal for some. When you first watch the video you watch a ""sexy dance"" for the first ten minutes, which uses very little and I mean very little of the pole. When I first watch this I thought it might be some kind of adult film, however this is not the case.  And the dancing is very medicore at best.  The only positive is that the video is English, however the video has two or three videos of how to dance I think?  These dances range from 8 to ten minutes so that's a lot of the video.  The pole dancing is very basic, like a couple of simple leg spins basic.  Then you have the editing and that's the worse part the editing.  I have no idea what they were doing but it's edited like a home film movie.  Also their are parts of the video where they interview them, this comes out of nowhere. So please, oh please don't buy this.",1523404800,,1010,4.015
