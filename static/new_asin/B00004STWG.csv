8371581,5,B00004STWG,"In the tradition of Pokemon and Digimon, we can now watch Monster Rancher.  If you have a Pokemon or Digimon fan at home, they will enjoy Monster Ranger just as much.  Our new hero, Genki (which means energy, and he's  full of it) is mystically transformed to the world of Monster Ranger while  playing the new ""Monster Ranger 200x"" on his Sony Playstation.  He joins a party of monsters and a fellow human (girl -- can't recall her  name) to find the mystical Pheonix monster who will turn all the bad  monsters, ruled by the evil Mu, into good monsters.  There's enough variety  and uniqueness for any ""Mon"" fan to enjoy these.  In the second  DVD, the party gathers new allies during various adventures.  I recommend  the actual Sony Playstation (Monster Ranger 2) game as well.",960854400,,781,4.654411764705882
