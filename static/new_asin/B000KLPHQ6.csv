8157971,5,B000KLPHQ6,Flo is an excellent musician with great speed and control. The DVD is really well presented and worth owning for any metal drummer looking to improve technique and speed control. Flo and Cryptopsy are awesome!,1191110400,,209,5.0
8157972,4,B000KLPHQ6,"so you want to play death metal, but that fast double bass and blasting just seems impossible, and you have no clue how flo, derek, and the rest got to those speeds. well, flo here will show you how to do it, and that's a great service. (btw the big secret is...lots and lots of chops drilling to a metronome, every day for the rest of your life. exactly what any drum teacher would tell you to do!) flo offers the viewer precise exercises that will definitely, with a lot of work, make you an extreme metal drummer. Conversely, Flo doesn't talk about advanced beats at all; the instruction is all chops. If you want to get into the really weird stuff he likes to play I imagine he'd just tell you to take Jazz and Latin lessons, like he did!

I wouldn't recommend this for experienced grinders, however. Like I said, the video is oriented towards beginners; aside from the much-anticipated discussion of the gravity blast I actually didn't learn anything I didn't know already. But I think it would have saved me a lot of time when I was starting out, having to put together my own practice routine for death metal. This isn't a fault, actually. The Derek Roddy dvd was the first death metal instructional, but it was waaaaay too hard for most people. Flo is filling in the gap for beginners. If you can play death metal already and want to learn about becoming a real monster on the kit, get Derek's dvd instead.

Flo put a lot of time and effort into this thing; it looks and sounds great, and what he teaches is very clear. (unlike the tim alexander dvd, which will teach you nothing) there's a bonus dvd that is all soloing, and it's a lot of fun - extreme metal drummers are usually terrible soloists, but Flo shows that it can be a really cool thing.",1171152000,8,1757,4.403076923076923
