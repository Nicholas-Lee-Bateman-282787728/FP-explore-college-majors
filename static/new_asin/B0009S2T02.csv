But don't take my word for it... Look up ""This Isn't Art"" by Rahman Jamal on ewetoob. This is one of the songs in this movie.

I'm sure you will come directly back here and purchase this DVD.",1378252800,,425,3.988235294117647
8065797,5,B0009S2T02,"The movie mixes the gritty street feel with true hiphop flows, a movie that any TRUE hiphop head should watch and definatly enjoy...the flows in the movie alone are worth seeing it definatly 5 stars",1237334400,2,198,4.685714285714286
8065798,5,B0009S2T02,"This movie deserves some recognition.  It's a great film that mixes music and story in a lyrical, interesting and compelling way.  Although it's not a suspense movie, the characters are strong enough and sympathetic enough that you truly want to know what's going to happen.

The best part of this movie is the mixing of the music into the context of the movie.  It's really interesting how rap is used in a narrative, lyrical and musical way to add depth and body and interest to both the story of the film and the characters.

Well done, I look forward to seeing more movies like this.",1158710400,5,587,4.552380952380952
