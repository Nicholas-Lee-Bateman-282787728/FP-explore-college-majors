7607632,5,B01AORSSTI,"**This review is for the steelbook edition of True Detective, not for the actual show.

This is one of the best steelbooks I've seen. It comes with a slipcover, so the actual artwork of the steelbook itself is just the black and white branches with Cohle and Hart standing in the black hole, right beneath them it says true detective. The back is the same just without our two main characters. Picture it without the red ""TRUE DETECTIVE'"" and all the other letters and you got yourself a grim dark tone that matches the series perfectly. It does come with the Digital HD code in case you were wondering. Inside of it, you got some more neat art and your 3 discs.
I recommend buying it if you enjoy collecting steelbooks, or even if you just like this one. You won't be disappointed.

NOTE: This is a Target exclusive, so if you don't feel comfortable buying from this seller you can just visit Target's website and check if they have one at your local Target and then go pick it up yourself or have it shipped to you.",1433808000,12,1017,4.404255319148936

8747941,5,B01AORSSTI,Woody and Matthew. My God. These two beautiful men were MADE to make this show. Absolutely captivating. The Woody/Matthew duo seriously make this show. Highly recommend. I've watched this at least 7 times now since I was introduced to it last year!,1520640000,,248,4.928571428571429

8747944,5,B01AORSSTI,"One of the best series I've ever watched, Matt is totally off the charts mesmerizing. Woodie is as always, amazing. I had planned to watch an episode every day or two, forget it. Had to watch two at a time ! Intense ! More twists and turns than a roller coaster ! Highly recommended, but beware this was an HBO presentation so basically contains some soft porn scenes, language and adult content. Not for kids. One of my top Five all time series. Right up there with Justified, Fargo, Sopranos , it's that good !",1499644800,,512,4.4

8747947,5,B01AORSSTI,"Pay attention; it's rare you get two actors (Woody and Matt) play their part with gusto and so believable. Woody stole the movie and Matt's performance went well above the cost of the production.  Recommend watching with no distractions so you can keep up with all the different suspects and plot(s), the ending was different and I wan't unhappy the way it closed.  Great movie and screenplay was top notch.",1484006400,,407,4.8
8747948,5,B01AORSSTI,Brilliant and chilling to the bone.  The acting is at a brilliant level.  Fascinating always.,1480636800,,93,5.133333333333334
