8394747,1,B003DCLGAK,"I saw this program on the History channel and had to look it up to review it. It is not good reporting. It uses selective evidence tactics to make hasty generalizations about any sort of conservative view of sexuality. Undergirding biases overrode any attempt to simply report the facts. Key biases that I could detect were: Political Progressivism and Liberalism, Secularism, Anti-supernaturalism, ""Free-love"" idealism (ie: that there is a real and accessible sex-without-consequences), religious skepticism, and a general distaste towards any traditional approaches to sexual morality. A lot of ""interpreting"" and opining inserts itself like it were scientific fact. This video set is propaganda. Don't take my word for it. Look it up for yourself. This video cites authoritatively Alfred Kinsey, Margaret Sanger, and Hugh Heffner. Look up who Kinsey's test subjects were (largely incarcerated criminals, and he reports data about inducing orgasm in 1-3month old babies). Look up Margaret Sanger's ""Negro Project"" (a racist attempt to phase out negroes by selective breeding tactics). And look up Hugh Heffner's funding efforts for ""No Fault Divorce"" between 1970-1980 (he profiteered off of legislatively destabilizing traditional marriage). If this program had any sense of responsibility, it would take seriously the consequences of the ideas it tosses around. Sure, there's some true information in here. But it's cherry picked in obvious avoidance of contrary evidence, so that viewers have their mind made up for them.

I suppose those who agree with this video may not be as upset as I am. But if you are going to agree with the conclusions put forth in this video, do so after seeing the big picture. I recommend West's ""Darwin Day in America."" Also, Michael Craven has some good work on the subject of the history of sexuality. On Kinsey's bad science see Judith Reisman's ""Sexual Sabotage,"" and Jeffrey Santinover's ""Homosexuality and the Politics of Truth."" And, look up the topic of ""Eugenics"" and you'll see some pretty hideous connections with Planned Parenthood and modern Abortion legislation.",1301097600,6,2111,5.377643504531722
