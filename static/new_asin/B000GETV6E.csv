8131092,1,B000GETV6E,"I purchased 2 of Bob Kato's painting dvd's. Painting the head in color, and painting the head in monochrome. The monochrome dvd worked like a charm, and was very enjoyable to watch. Bob was generous in his instruction, completing a total of 6 demonstrations. I would strongly recommend the monochrome dvd. This dvd, painting the head in color, on the other hand simply will not play. When loaded into my dvd player, a ""Bad Disc"" message appears. I contacted Amazon. Their response was superb. They expedited a replacement quickly and efficiently no questions asked, simply an apology, for my inconvenience. The problem is, the replacement dvd also will not play. I tried playing both of them in my computer and my dvd player connected to my television. Now, I have two copies that I will be returning to amazon. It's been incredibly frustrating, because I'd much rather own the dvd, rather than a get issued a refund. Gnomon Studio, the producers of this item, really needs to look into their quality control. What are the odds of receiving 2 brand new copies of a disc, and having both of them be defective?

*update*

After speaking with a Rep from Amazon and deciding that I would like to try one more copy before getting a refund, I was issued a third copy of this DVD. The third copy failed to play as well. I'm clueless, as to why this is happening. Every DVD I own works just fine in both my players. I've never had this happen before. I can only conclude that the merchandise is defective.",1368748800,,1497,4.62406015037594
