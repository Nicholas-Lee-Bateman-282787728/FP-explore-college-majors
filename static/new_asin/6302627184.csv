7829919,4,6302627184,"I thought the Tango portion was great, very entertaining, and watched it over & over.  Great skating choreography to the Tango.  The Tango music arrangement was great.  Some of it I recognize to be arranged by the great Viennese conductor, composer, & song writer, Robert Stolz.  Looks like fun to do and would make for a great local ice show for a skating club. The Carmen portion not so good.",1393545600,,394,4.585714285714285
7829920,3,6302627184,This is one of the first figure skating tapes I've bought.  I love skating and I thought I'd enjoy it.  I did.  There are no big name stars here with the exception of Tatyana Tarasova.  It's a fine addition to any figure skating fan's video library.,1129680000,2,249,4.3478260869565215
