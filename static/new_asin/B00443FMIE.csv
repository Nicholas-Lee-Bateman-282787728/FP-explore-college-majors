8415766,5,B00443FMIE,"This was a well-done history of Chicago, its planning & development after the Chicago Fire, especially the effects which Daniel Burnham had on it architecturally. He was an amazing planner for that city's destiny as well as for a number of other cities.
I was born in Chicago in late-1943 and lived there until I entered the Marines in late 1962. Sure, I had seen many of the wonderful buildings for which the City is known, many of its wonderful park lands, and even ""leftovers"" from the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, but I never knew many of the why's and wherefore's and this video brought much of that together.
I now have a much better appreciation for the post-Fire to pre-Depression history of my hometown, the planning and development thereof, and the influences of some truly great, farsighted men like Burnham.",1368489600,9,825,4.858156028368795
8415767,5,B00443FMIE,"A good documentary. I visit Chicago a couple of times a year, and I enjoy history, architecture, and a good human interest story. This has all three, and I highly recommend.",1297382400,5,173,4.612903225806452
