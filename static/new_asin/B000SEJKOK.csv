2884172,5,B000SEJKOK,"This was an excellent adaptation of Dominick Dunne's best-selling novel. The all-star cast gives wonderful performances in a story of wealth and privilege verses truth and justice. Patrick Dempsey gives an excellent performance as the 'star-struck' scholarship student brought into this world for a price of his character and honesty to support a crime of murder.  As an adult author; he is recalling the events that have haunted and poisoned his life and family.  Playing the wealthy family are Blair Brown as the matriarch, Brian Dennehey as the patriarch-both giving convincing performances of parents who will go to any lengths to protect their children; no matter what it takes. A movie you will not forget.",1195344000,15,712,5.182608695652174

I recorded it on VHS when it aired on t.v  but haven't been able to watch it since I don't have a VHS player any longer. I sure wish Amazon would take an interest in this wonderfully portrayed movie so we could purchase it! I also agree, 5 stars just aren't enough! I've even tried to watch it on you tube, but no one has posted the full movie

8205177,5,B000SEJKOK,"First, ""A Season In Purgatory"" should rate more than 5 stars!!!  I have searched and searched for this movie and I am in the process of going thru the local newspaper for help from the readers.  This is how wonderful a movie and the lengths I will go to get it.  ""A Season In Purgatory""
will keep you on the edge of your seat for the 3-4 hours
watching for the next moment of action, suspense, murder,
lies, truth, decency, etc...wondering who and what will win out.  Patrick Dempsey is the ""poor"" talented college young man who gets wrapped up in the rich powerful Brian Dennehy's son's family, but really ""wins"" out in the end.  It's worth finding and watching over again and again.  It's truly an awesome movie only Dommick Dunne can write.  I pray I have helped someone with my first review. I know I could go on and on, but I don't want to give too much away.  *****IF SOMEONE FINDS THIS 2 PART MOVIE PLEASE LET AMAZON KNOW, THANKS****",1195862400,18,940,4.393063583815029
