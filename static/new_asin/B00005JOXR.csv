1546820,5,B00005JOXR,"I never watched this series when it was on from 1990-1994~

I purchased this set because of the reviews~ I AM 100% THRILLED WITH THE DVD SET~ this series is very very good~

Burt Reynolds is a VERY former winning football HERO returned home as ""very"" LOOSING hometown football coach MOST FUNNY~  ADD wife Marilu Henner as his DA wife~ the humor is LOW key so it has timeless humor~ the main couple are great fun~ but the side characters have depth and are great~ add Charles Durning~ Elizabeth Ashley~ Ossie Davis~ and many more~ FANTASTIC WRITING~

The hometown HUMOR and feel makes this series still FRESH and enjoyable over 14 years later~ very like the Newhart in feel.

BETTER than I expected~ I can hardly wait for the next three Seasons but no doubt CBS video will take years go them out~

I GIVE IT A SOLID 8 OUT OF 10 FOR HUMOR, ACTING AND VERY EXCELLENT WRITING~ GREAT SERIES~",1215475200,2,886,4.472049689440993
1546821,4,B00005JOXR,"""Evening Shade,"" a CBS-TV series that ran from 1990-94, holds a special place in the Burt Reynolds canon... Reynolds acted prodigiously on TV and in film throughout the 1960s, '70s and '80s, but this was one of his best and longest-lived roles, playing Wood Newton, a retired NFL player who has become a high school football coach for a perpetually losing small town team. The show was a half-hour sit-com dramedy with a high-powered cast that also included Ossie Davis, Hal Holbrook and Marilu Henner -- Reynolds directed almost half the episodes, but one of the show's strengths was how well he shared the spotlight. Reynolds is unhurried and relaxed, a mature actor in a mature, middle-aged role.  The show's rhythms are familiar: in its cosmopolitan-professional-settling-in-a-small-town premise, it strongly recalls the second Bob Newhart show, including the large cast of wacky locals; there is also a domestic aspect of the show that recalls shows like ""Family Ties,"" et al., but with an occasionally adult, raunchy edge (in the pilot episode, for example, Coach finds out that his late-in-life vasectomy failed, and that he and Marilu are now expecting another child) While the show conformed to some of the formulas of network TV, it also had its own unique tone and charms.  Fans will be happy to see Season One out on DVD; newcomers may be charmed as well. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1214697600,,1403,5.017167381974249
1546822,5,B00005JOXR,"Evening Shade is a 1980's throw back to the great TV of the 1960's. Burt Reynolds leads a cast veteran actors in a modern day Andt Griffith show.

 Wood Newton  (Reynolds) is a former pro American Football player who has retired and returned to his childhood home with his wife (Marilu Henner) and his kids, the small town of Evening Shade, Arkansas. He's now the coach of the local high school football team. His assistant Herman Stiles (Micheal Jeter) acts like a Barney Fife to Wood's Andy. There is his friend Ponder Blue (Ossie Davis, who looks like he is having a ball doing this), The town Doctor and his wife (Charles Durning and Ann Wedgeworth) and Wood's Father in Law (Hal Holbrook)

One could wish this DVD would have Reynolds, Holbrook, Durning or Henner doing an audio commentary track. However this aint happening

We have lost the talents of Micheal Jeter and Ossie Davis. This show is a showcase to their  acting talents.

so go get some shade and bask in its laughter

1546823,5,B00005JOXR,"Evening Shade was the comeback show for Burt Reynolds and the follow-up show for Marilu Henner.  As a rule these shows are usually a disaster but Evening Shade was beautifully written with a supporting cast to die for. Produced by Linda Bloodworth Thomason at the height of her Designing Women success.

The show focuses on Wood Newton (Reynolds), a former pro football player who has returned to his home town of Evening Shade, Arkansas to be the town's high school football coach and his wife Ada (Henner), a lawyer who becomes the town's DA.  The following cast of supporting characters round out the show:

Herman Stiles (Michael Jeter)- Wood's assistant coach

Frida Evans (Elizabeth Ashley) - Ada's free thinking sister

Ponder Blue (Ossie Davis) - The owner of the local bar and grill

Evan Evans (Hal Holbrook) - Ada's father

Merleen Eldridge (Ann Wedgeworth) - Evan's younger girlfriend

Dr. Harlan Elldridge (Charles Durning) - The town doctor

Burt Reynolds received an Emmy Award fot this season - his only career Emmy.  Plus Charles Durning, Michael Jeter and Elizabeth Ashley receive nominations for this season.

This show brought together some of the finest actors from Broadway including five Tony Award winners.

Michael Jeter was fresh off his emotional Tony Award win for Grand Hotel and this show made him a star. He won the Emmy for the second season.

Charles Durning also was fresh off his Tony win but he had been a major character actor in all mediums for the last twenty years. He received two Oscar nominations in 1982 & 1983. And prior to the show, received 4 Emmy nominations.

Ashley had been a confirmed Broadway star since her 1975 Tony Award win.

Ann Wedgeworth also received a Tony Award for Neil Simon's Chapter Two.

And And of course Holbrook (Tony winner in 1966) has been working in all mediums for longer - including working with his wife, Dixie Carter, on Designing Women.

Ossie Davis was a two time Tony award winner with over 30 years on Broadway, Films and Television when he joined this show.  Prior to this show he received two Emmy nominations.

As you can see, this show brought together a great cast of stars.

The DVD set contains all 24 episodes of this charming comedy series' first season.",1210291200,45,2246,4.81201044386423

The characters feel real. The jokes are truly at no ones expense. Every episode left me smiling. Having grown up in a small community, I can relate to the characters: their foibles, eccentricities and often misplaced but true good intentions. About every two years I re watch the show - enough time to forget particulars, but not enough to forget how truly real and affectionate the characters (and most probably the actors) are towards each other.

It is unfortunate that the show didn't ""live"" longer than it did, but perhaps THAT is part of the reason for its consistent briliance -- not dragging along for years after the best ideas are gone.  This series really IS the best that TV has to offer, as far as I am concerned, and I have been watching TV sitcoms since the 1950s.  ""Thank you, Burt Reynolds, Marilu Henner, Hal Holbrook, ""The Lovely Fontana Beausoleil"" Linda, Charles Durning (the funniest sitcom doctor EVER), Ossie Davis with his gorgeous voice perfect to narrate, Ann Wedgeworth as the sweetest Southern Girl of all, Elizabeth Ashley, the NOT so sweet Southern Girl -- really EVERY ONE ON THE CAST could not be better -- intelligent, witty, sweet, funny, charming in every way. And that doesn't even BEGIN to mention the amazing cast of guest stars, ranging from Terry Bradshaw, Tammy Wynette, TONY BENNETT, Willie Nelson, Richard Simmons in an extremely charming segment -- just AMAZING in every way -- television at its finest.

The characterizations are well played by all, although Henner is just saccharin sweet and too gushy for a Mom of three. Either Burt and Hal Holbrook aren't too happy in their roles or else their humor's become a lot drier than it used to be. Elizabeth Ashley's the sparkplug of the whole works and is really funny. All in all, it's a good, clean comedy sitcom and entertaining although we tired of it after 4-5 episodes. But, at 83, we tire of most everything except naps.",1401235200,,618,4.517857142857143

How can they NOT put out Seasons 2-4?  It's ridiculous.  One of the finest ensemble of actors and they're not going to keep their work alive?  The studios are doing this over and over again.  I don't get it!

1547256,3,B00005JOXR,"Do you ever remember a show more fondly than it deserved. That is the case with Evening Shade. Makes me remeber why I did not like it when it was on prime time. Marilou Henner is awful, and Burt Reynolds, a favorite, really is stiff in this production. Some of the cast are good, and make it a more pleasing show. Too bad the performances of the lead characters bring it down",1369699200,,375,4.222222222222222

1547327,5,B00005JOXR,"Evening show had a tremendous cast and was very well written. It's a story about small town life and the charming people in that town. I wish they would come out with the rest of the series on DVD. I don't know if they ever will because the first season came out a long time ago. Probably didn't sell that well, that's why they haven't done the rest. Its not a show that everyone knows about, but its truly a great show. It was funny, and it touch on the social issues at the same time. Come on guys, give us the second season already! Give us the entire series in a box set!  One of my favorite shows ever.",1359072000,,607,4.058333333333334

1547329,4,B00005JOXR,"The Burt Reynolds sitcom set in Evening Shade, Arkansas was produced by Linda Bloodworth Thomason and her husband, avid supporters of President Bill Clinton. They also produced Designing Women. The cast is first rate with top talent featuring Reynolds as a small town football coach, Wood Newton, and his wife, Ada, played by Marilu Henner. They return home from the big city with their growing family. They are surrounded by talent and laughs with this cast.

Hal Holbook played Evan Evans, a newspaper owner in a small town. His feisty sister, Frieda, is perfectly played by the wonderful Elizabeth Ashley. Michael Jeter played the assistant coach. Ossie Davis played the restaurant owner. Charles Durning played the mayor and Ann Wedgeworth played his wife. Despite some silliness, the cast is simply wonderful, first rate, perfectly casted to dispel stereotypes about Arkansas.

The series had a nice run but it could have lasted years with the talent on it's show. Reynolds and Jeter earned Emmy awards. There were plenty of Emmy nominations in the supporting actor and actress categories for the cast as well. They don't make shows like this anymore. This was a show of substance where they could be funny, clean, and learn something about life especially the  children.

The only drawback is the lack of special features from 5 DVDs. It is still a beautifully crafted family oriented show with a first rate cast.",1357603200,,1419,5.025531914893617
1547330,5,B00005JOXR,I have been a big Burt Reynolds fan and enjoyed this comedy when it was on TV.  I wish they would put season 2 on DVD also.,1356220800,,123,3.5555555555555554
1547331,5,B00005JOXR,"Let me start off by saying that I just loved the first couple of seasons of Evening Shade. However, The video quality on this DVD was just awful. Even if I had known that at time of purchased, I may have not gotten it even at the outstanding Amazon price of $13.82 of which I paid. To be listed retail at $39.98 is simply criminal. Based on Quality, this should be sold for $9.99 at best. If it was up to today's standard, I would not hesitate to buy future seasons.

Again, if you are a fan of Evening Shade as I am, don't let this review discourage you from buying it. I seriously doubt they will be releasing anymore if they put so little effort into this one.",1356134400,,663,4.1395348837209305

1547394,5,B00005JOXR,"I saw this series, sparingly, in the early 90's and loved it, but always remembered it FONDLY,. So when I saw it offered, I got it immediately. I wanted to buy the full collection, but only season 1 is offered now. It starts off slowly, but after a few programs, picks up. MICHEAL JETER is a complete TREASURE and is so very. very FUNNY. He's so PERFECT. MARILU HENNER is WONDERFUL as coach Newton's wife. Their chemistry is great. Charles Durning as the town doctor is great. Ann Wedgeworth is perfect as the doc's dizzy, sexy wife. Elizabeth Ashley (really good), Hal Holbrook, and Ossie Davis make up much of the rest of the cast in this wonderfully written, very sweet, warm, heartfelt and funny story of small town life. (writers also did Designing Women) I just finished watching it and can't wait for season 2 and 3. The introduction to the cast of Billy Bob Thorton is eagerly anticipated. This series is PRECIOUS!

1547435,5,B00005JOXR,"From September 1990 through May of 1994 those of us who managed to find this delightful show and chase it around the CBS schedule (it went from Friday at 8 to Monday at 8, then Monday at 9:30, back to Friday at 8 and finally back to Monday at 8, all in the first twelve months it was on!) felt we were part of that little town in Arkansas called Evening Shade. The people there were people we knew and cared about because they cared about each other. We laughed with them and, sometimes, we cried with them. They were the families we wanted to be like and the town we wanted to live in. In today's world of endless ""reality"" shows that bear no resemblance to the reality most of us experience, a retreat to Evening Shade soothes the nerves and sweetens the outlook. The people of Evening Shade, like all of us, are not perfect, but they try to enjoy life and do the best they can. They are kind to each other.  What better standard could there be for any of us?",1282521600,7,961,4.194594594594594

My favorite show was the one where they all went camping and somehow lost their clothes and the guys had to find items like tin foil to cover up so they could walk home.  That was hilarious.  Can't wait!,1278892800,,377,4.027027027027027

1547440,3,B00005JOXR,"The first disc in this set seems to be out of focus.  about the 3rd disc it gets better.  The quirky characters still hold up surprising well.
I believe the writers also wrote Designing Women, which to me is a far better series.  The Delta Burke role against Dixie Carter along with Jean Smart and Annie Potts with occasional spots for Alice Ghostly in the show just are so well done they could be run as a new series today.

I was excited when this 1st season was released, unfortunately my memories of the show were better than the show actually was.",1247875200,,552,4.382352941176471
