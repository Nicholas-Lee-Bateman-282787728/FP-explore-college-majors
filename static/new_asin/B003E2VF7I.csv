4112976,5,B003E2VF7I,"I was unfamiliar with the Director and knew little about the film, but saw that it was presented by Film Movement, so I decided to give it a watch while recovering from surgery. You really can't go wrong with any movie presented by Film Movement, they have excellent independent films from around the world. I was not disappointed. This little French Canadian film was a trip down memory lane when it came to hair, clothing, and early 1980's cultural icons like calculator watches. It was funny, touching and a reminder of what it's like to be on the cusp of adolescence: trying to fit in, make friends, have your first crush all while trying  to figure out just who you are and what is important. There are the inevitable clashes with parents and siblings which make you realize your parents aren't perfect and everything in life might not be what it seems on the surface.

This film is worth your time. Watch it.",1400544000,,914,4.601226993865031
4112977,4,B003E2VF7I,"This French film is based upon director and writer Ricardo Trogi's early childhood focuses on his coming of age antics at the age of 11.  The French film is set in Canada  during 1981.  The setting is so true to 1981, that the viewer is instantly and authentically taken back to 1981.  The film is a wonderful film, very well done, well directed, and continuously  interesting throughout, humorous, and sensitive.

Eleven-year old Ricardo enters a new neighborhood and realizes he doesn't quite fit in with the classmates.  His parents are not well off financially, and his father is between jobs.  Young Ricardo is observant to the clothes of the wealthier students, gets caught up in the materialism and makes up some lies to get by.  In one funny scene, he chastises his parents for living beyond their means and his mother gives him one helluva verbal scolding.

It is often in children's lives that they become embarrassed about their own family, who do not meet the standard the child's views as acceptable.  Plus, another complication sets in...Ricardo has a crush on the pretty girl from school.  But, on top of all his deception and lies to fit in, he learns something about his friends.

This film is labeled a Film Movement, a production that makes available foreign film that includes quality movies, quality directing...... Rizzo",1321142400,3,1342,4.911111111111111
4112978,4,B003E2VF7I,"Let me start by stating that I have become a huge fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies, released on a monthly basis. I have seen quite a few of them lately and have rarely been disappointed.

""1981"" (102 min.; 2009 release from Canada) is a delicious coming of age movie, briging us the story of 11 year old Ricardo Trogi as he settles into a new school after his family moved. Among other things, Ricardo develops a crush on a girl in his class, and he tries very hard to fit in and to befriend several of the 'cool' kids in the class. This movie does for the late 70s/early 80s what ""Stand By Me"" did for the 1950 and ""The Wonder Years"" for the late 60s/early 70s. The tone during the entire movie is bitter-sweet, and a smile ic never far away when you are watching this.

It should also be noted that the movie is spoken in a decidely French-Quebecois accent, which is quite hilarious at times. Last but not least, the movie was directed by... Ricardo Trogi, yes the title character in the movie. I only caught on to this when the credit were rolling at the conclusion of the movie. Quite the autobiographical film, indeed, and very much worth seeing.",1302998400,3,1179,4.378995433789954

What is it to be a young person on the cusp of adolescence? To sense that there's a great big adult world out there that you're not privy to. To feel those first stirrings of romantic desire. It's a stage we all go through at one point in our lives. Some of us prefer to ignore that part of of our past. Ricardo Trogi chose to make a movie about it.

The film is called 1981 and centers around his life growing up as a recently-relocated eleven-year-old boy living in Quebec. It tells the tale of young Ricardo adjusting to life in a new school, dealing with his family (including a sister who is obsessed with the family cat), making new friends and developing his first crush on a beautiful girl who knows how to write in long-hand...

This is an all-around entertaining film! Ricardo is a very sympathetic character, and even when he does something rather cruel, we sense that it's not out of cruelty that he does it. His parents are both hard-working individuals who are trying their best to provide for themselves and for him. His friends all come off as realistic and the one boy who is something of a bully is still shown in the end to be a decent lad with some issues.

I've never seen any of Trogi's films before, but after seeing this one I'll definitely be seeking out more. This was an entirely enjoyable, entertaining movie and I'd love to see some follow-up films a few years down the line. Truly excellent!

== Short Film ==

This month's short film truly is short, coming in at only a few minutes. It's a few great minutes, however! It's called ""Lupe & Bruno"" and is a delightful stop-motion movie showing a young girl who has a crush on a young boy who doesn't seem to know she exists. It's vastly entertaining and very funny and adds to the value of this disc. A really wonderful short!",1286150400,6,1873,4.430232558139535

Very slow and not much ""coming of age"" except for the very end when the main character and his 3 friends start telling each other the truth. Definitely a star for the inclusion of the song ""Hard Times"" by the Human League. Other than that, not very reflective of the time period.",1496188800,,352,4.268656716417911

8395252,4,B003E2VF7I,"I teach middle school French, and this is one I show to my students if I skip the scene where the boys are gossiping about Anne's past.  I pause at 42:50 and skip right to 44:08 and it's a more-or-less subtle transition.  You don't miss anything important in the plot and avoid an uncomfortable conversation about sexual acts.  It's a little irrelevant to my students because it's set before they were born, but they still say they enjoy it.",1490572800,,441,4.556962025316456
