2203802,5,B00077G60O,"Don't say no ... if you are interested in an in-depth analysis of the beliefs of those who claim to have been abducted by aliens or channel messages from them.  Statistically, the average person only reads/views content that ""already supports"" their pre-existing beliefs.  However, the wise read/view alternative points of view to sift-through new views to challenge what they currently accept to be true.

Although the documentary was created ""from the beginning"" to support christian views vs aliens' existence, I absolutely was fascinated by the thorough research and comparison of the beliefs of those who reported alien contact to BOTH common christian and eastern philosophical beliefs.

If life is simply a buffet of beliefs from which you can choose from and you would like to explore the psychology of those who report alien contact while discerning the producers' views, - you'll enjoy the movie.

As a professional psychic medium, many clients wonder if insightful channeled messages come from God, spirit guides, our higher-self, or even interplanetary consciousness.  However, if specific, accurate, & timely channeled messages result in calm & reassurance, would most people need to know ""exactly"" how & where it came from ?

2203803,1,B00077G60O,I was very disappointed with this movie. It is a cheap make of what could be an interesting topic. I don't recommed anyone waste their time with it.,1389312000,,148,4.321428571428571
2203804,1,B00077G60O,"I have rarely been this angry over a movie - enough to write a review - something I NEVER do!!

This was utter fundamentalist religious garbage disguised as a documentary on the UFO phenomenon.  It was SO CAREFUL to hide the intent of the makers to spring the revelation on the viewer near the end that ""Many experts in the world agree - UFOs are NOT from space but instead are demons from HELL!!""

O.
M.
G!!

I am sick and tired of these sneak attacks by the religious right who think that if they hide their intent behind a subject that the viewer may have an interest in the BY GOD we got 'em and now we can convert 'em to the TRUTH!!

The makers of this film spent the bulk of the film going through all of the evidence in such a way that it seemed to be a thoughtful discourse - until they started trotting out the wing-nuts at the very end.  Now they start quoting from books that no one in their right mind would ever take seriously.  They were describing these last ""experts"" saved for the end as highly regarded and esteemed - they just don't tell you that they are only highly regarded and esteemed in the religious fundamentalist circles they travel in but not by any true UFO researchers.

They saved the final insult to our intelligence for the very last where you listened to a preacher preach inside his church at the camera explaining how it is right there in the bible that UFOs are the fallen angels of the bible.  Then they end the film with a biblical quote.

I am not angry that they made the film - am angry that they hid their true intentions in making this film in such an underhanded way - worse than the deceitful ""demons"" they vilify.

You people should be ashamed of yourselves!!!

2203805,5,B00077G60O,"If you are looking for a spiritual explanation for the existence of UFOs and alien beings, then this is a must watch. In the secular making of other such documentaries you will only hear how the presence of alien life can come from some distant planet or solar system. This video touches on the numerous fallacies and myths of this claim.

For Christians who have tried to reconcile the assertions that aliens are from other worlds with their faith, this will help to clear the air by pointing to some more obscure passages in scripture that help answer that question.

For a more comprehensive understanding of this connection, one may want to read, ""Lights in the sky and little green men"" (Ross), or a more extensive scholarly work, ""Exo-Vatincan"" (Horn and Putman). In the coming years it will be imperative that Christians are able to understand, and - more importantly - explain the correlation between 'space aliens' and the demonic forces described in the bible.",1368230400,,970,4.872727272727273

2203807,2,B00077G60O,"""The UFO Conspiracy"" is a Christian fundamentalist film arguing that the UFO phenomenon is demonic and Satanic in character. However, this somewhat contentious message only enters the picture frame (or is it the radar screen?) after about 45 minutes, and this in a documentary that's around 70 minutes.

The first part of ""The UFO Conspiracy"" is a boring and somewhat confusing overview of the UFO phenomenon at large. Once again, we meet Condon, Project Blue Book, the foo fighters, and what not.

In the second part of the documentary, all caution is thrown overboard. Abduction cases, including that of Whitley Strieber, are taken as hard evidence for the demonic nature of the UFOs. John Keel's and Jacques Valle's books are quoted. Finally, I.D.E. Thomas (author of ""The Omega Conspiracy"") reveals the pertinent Bible passages, including the story of the Nephilim in Genesis. ""The UFO Conspiracy"" ends with two verses from Paul's second letter to the Corinthians, 2:9 and 11:14.

My problem with this is not that alien abductions are recognized as evil. The problem is rather the selective use of evidence. Contactees who claim that UFOs are benign explain away the bizarre alien abductions in various ways, while groups claiming all aliens are malign explain away the Space Brothers with their long, flowing hair and golden beards. Another problem becomes obvious when the narrator quotes channelled messages from the *good* aliens. These deny that Jesus was unique, claim that ""ye are gods"" or that Jesus was an alien himself. Thus, the real proof for the demonic character of Orthon, A-Lan, Aura Rhanes and all the others, is that they didn't adhere to the Nicene creed as interpreted by the likes of I.D.E. Thomas.

Somehow, I don't consider that conclusive evidence.

But even apart from that, ""UFO Conspiracy"" is simply too boring...",1351900800,,1844,5.112956810631229
2203808,3,B00077G60O,"The second part of the film, starting at about 25 minutes in, is especially worth watching. Until then, it is very typical of what you often can see on TV, with a lot of time spent discussing UFO sightings so as to convince us there's something out there. In that time for me, I didn't see anything new that I haven't already seen in other similar movies and TV shows (except for the mention that they thought that what happened at Fatima--the sun coming out of the sky--was a UFO). It's only the second part of the film that gets to the analysis of what may be going on and to the ""conspiracies."" I thought the ideas about hypnotism ""loosing the spirit"" was especially interesting. I originally gave this film two stars due to its dull beginnings (and straightforward dullness to begin with) but then changed it to a three upon watching the second half a couple of times.",1345680000,,872,4.490566037735849
2203809,5,B00077G60O,"I recommend this DVD.  I disagree with only a few small points, but overall, that we are being visited by aliens, and that they have evil intent, I agree.

2203812,3,B00077G60O,"I found this movie to be disappointing on many levels. I found the first part of the movie to be very information, where they documented famous alien encounters. Then, the movie really went downhill. I was expecting to hear a lot of information on how these UFO sitings were spoken of in the Bible, because I have heard a lot of really great talks on this subject, but the movie barely spent 15 minutes on this.

The movie also referenced accounts people had given while under hypnosis. These accounts are absolutely unreliable. Hypnosis has been proven to cause false memories..

There is a great deal of background information, a bit of scientific information and several short interviews.  The result is a clear and concise presentation.  The graphics and pictorial evidence done well enough to keep your attention, too.  This is clearly based on IDE Thomas' ""The Omega Conspiracy.""

Prior to viewing ""The UFO Conspiracy,"" I hadn't given much thought to UFOs, aliens or abductions.  However, these days, the popularity of UFOs is undeniable and many people seem to believe in ET.  The prevalence of these beliefs is important, whether or not you agree with them.

8045466,4,B00077G60O,"Originally published in 1995 and titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UFOs-The-Hidden-Truth-VHS/dp/0005445825/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UFOs : The Hidden Truth [VHS</a>], for many this film is now a classic in the Christian documentary genre. While this may be true, and the video still worthy of viewing (I've owned a copy for years), for the Bible-believing Christian the film leaves several loose ends and presents a somewhat confusing conclusion.

For example, the back cover of the DVD asks the question; ""What on Earth are UFOs?"" Unfortunately, this is never answered. Instead, (---SPOILER ALERT---) at the 37-minute mark, the documentary goes off on a tangent and begins addressing rare encounters with CREATURES sometimes associated with UFOs. Sightings of unexplained life forms which many today wrongly identify as ""aliens from other planets"". After this, the documentary never returns to address the UFO question. The problem with this, is that the majority of all UFO sightings NEVER ENCOUNTER an unexplained creature. The vast majority of UFO sightings are just THAT - sightings of arial phenomena that remains unexplained. The ""alien"" question is another subject completely.

Secondly, (---SPOILER ALERT---) the conclusion to the film suggests that the creatures witnessed during ""close encounters"" are, in fact, another round of offspring produced by a return of the fallen ""sons of God"" (Gen. 6:1-4). While this may be a HALF TRUTH, it is not completely true, for it ignores the fact that the scriptural record describes the original children of the fallen angels as ""giants"" - creatures which LOOKED LIKE GIANT MEN. [NOTE: The idea that modern aliens are ""Nephilim"" is mainly presented by I.D.E. Thomas, author of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omega-Conspiracy-Satan-s-Last-Assault-On-God-s-Kingdom/dp/0978845358/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omega Conspiracy: Satan's Last Assault On God's Kingdom</a>"" (1986). Bill Alnor, author of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ufo-s-in-the-New-Age-Extraterrestrial-Messages-and-the-Truth-of-Scripture/dp/0801002265/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ufo's in the New Age: Extraterrestrial Messages and the Truth of Scripture</a>"" ( 1992) also acts as story consultant. Both of these books are good materials for the Bible-believing Christian].

In other words, the ""Nephilim"" of Genesis 6 were not 3 and 4-foot-tall ""little green men"" with over-sized heads, and big, black, buggy, almond-shaped eyes. This is not the Bible's record. Instead, biblical examples of giants include ""Og of Bashan"" (11ft. tall or more) and ""Goliath"" (9.5 ft tall) [NOTE: These two examples are part of the company of giants which appeared ""also after that"" (Gen. 6:4)]. The half-breed children of the fallen ""Sons of God"" became renowned, ""mighty men"" precisely for the fact that they LOOKED LIKE GIANT MEN. Similarly, angels are described over and over again in the Bible as looking exactly like ""men"", yet they are NOT HUMAN MEN, but a different life form altogether. This is how the Genesis 6 ""giants"" can be referred to as ""mighty men"" while not being REAL HUMAN MEN at all.

And finally (---SPOILER ALERT---), to ask the question ""What on Earth are UFOs?"", and to answer by suggesting that they are demons produced by the fallen sons of God, makes no sense. I understand the ""point"" the video is trying to make, and I agree, but they're asking the wrong questions. UFOs are not demons. UFOs are undoubtedly connected with the demonic, but the flying crafts themselves are not ""demons"". Demons are not fat, round, shiny blinking lights that land in people's backyards or are chased by fighter jets. The scriptures show that demons cannot manifest themselves in living flesh, they can only ""possess"" living flesh. This means that neither UFOs nor aliens are ""demons manifest in the flesh"". Undoubtedly the creatures witnessed during ""close encounters"" are ""demon possessed"", but the physical bodies they inhabit are not their own. Nor are those bodies ""giants"" like the direct offspring of fallen angels (Gen. 6). I agree with the video that the modern ""alien"" phenomenon is connected with demonic activity. Amen to that. But pointing to the ancient Genesis 6 account as an explanation for something that's happening again is not enough. There's more to it. This is so, because the PHYSICAL APPEARANCE of modern, so-called, ""aliens"" does not match the scriptural record of the Genesis 6 account.

This review may sound like a ""knock"" against this video, but it's not. In a very, very broad and general sense, especially in regards to the deceptive spirit behind the modern alien phenomenon, this is a good Christian expose'. The question the video should be asking is not ""What on Earth are UFOs?"" (the video never answers this), but ""What on Earth are aliens?"". This question would be more in accord with their solution. But regardless, Bible-believing Christians need to realize the scriptures present much more detail than what's presented in this short 70-minute video. This DVD is good. I still consider it THE BEST Christian video on the subject. But it's nearly 20-years-old. And being such, it was first published at the infancy of the internet. Today, Christians and non-christians alike are much more savvy in regards to the UFO/alien phenomenon than they were 20 years ago. An update of this presentation and an expansion of its scriptural underpinnings would be great.

8045467,5,B00077G60O,"And I still recommend it to people to this very day.

As a truth seeker, my one disclaimer about the film is that it does not at all go into the aspect of ufology that is decidedly human... that which deals with the existence of top secret, experimental craft hearkening back to ""lost"" and forgotten Tesla technology.

But this is hardly a reason to shy away from the film because there are many layers to this topic as there are to any area of in-depth study.
Where this movie really shines is in its analysis of the UFO question from a Christian worldview.  No small feat, especially considering that it does so in a manner that is still gripping and compelling all of these years after its original release under the title of ""UFO's: The Hidden Truth""--that fascinates any student of the topic whether religious or not.",1399507200,,822,4.578231292517007
