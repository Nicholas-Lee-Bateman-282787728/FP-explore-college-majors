8602937,2,B00E9BY5AM,"This was a very expensive training video, compared to the golden information found within. If you have never shot in a practical pistol or multigun match, then you should just go watch one. You will learn everything this video mentions with a little practice and a few conversations with other shooters. I would give this dvd 5 stars if I get half of my money back.

If you have any experience shooting multi gun or practical pistol, do not buy this.
If you think you need to watch this before you try it for your first time, then it will help.",1390953600,,544,4.3861386138613865
