Andrews Blu-ray Review: Here we are again with another entry in my Alien Invasion Films of the 1950s series, this time we have this Sci-Fi classic from 1956 called EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS. This is an interesting film in that has a typical 1950s fun feel to it made all the better by the amazing special effects by animation master Ray Harryhausen! This is actually the first time Ray Harryhausen animated something other than a living creature showing how creative and versatile he was. Stop-motion animation is done by photographing models one frame at a time to give the illusion that they are in motion when the film is played back and the models are normally constructed around flexible armatures, and then optically combining the results with live action, often using a technique known as the traveling matte. This Sci-Fi film was influenced by a book written by Major Donald E. Keyhoe entitled Flying Saucers From Outer Space.

When live action is combined with the animated miniature, tricks can be played with scale, so that a model less than a foot tall can appear to loom up like a colossus. The first film with Ray Harryhausen in full charge of technical effects was The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms [1953]. The filmmakers learned that a long-time friend of Ray Harryhausen, author Ray Bradbury, had sold a short story called The Fog Horn to The Saturday Evening Post, about a dinosaur drawn to a lone lighthouse by its foghorn. Because the story for Ray Harryhausens film featured a similar scene, the film studio bought the rights to Ray Bradburys story to avoid any potential legal problems. Ray Harryhausen soon met and began a fruitful partnership with producer Charles Schneer, who was working with the B-movie unit of Columbia Pictures.

With the Sci-Fi film EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS [1956] we find the space scientist Dr. Russell Marvin [Hugh Marlowe] rushes home from his honeymoon with new wife Carol [Joan Taylor] because alien androids have been shooting down his satellites. Dr. Russell Marvin soon discovers that the evil extra-terrestrials plan to take over the Earth, so he tries to come up with a weapon that will stop them. Full of spectacular sequences involving huge flying saucers, ray guns and weird aliens, the film climaxes with an exciting battle between Earths military and the saucers over the city of Washington D.C. during which a number of famous landmarks are destroyed by the saucers. So impressive is the destruction that, for a time, we find ourselves rooting for the aliens.

When the Russian Sputnik was only a year away from being launched, alien invaders descended on Washington D.C. with their terrifying death rays in director Fred F. Searss EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS one of countless films of the 1950s period to come out of a social fabric defined equally by interest in the unknown and mounting Cold War paranoia. Here, however, such social significance takes a backseat to pure B-movie matinee fun, albeit without losing any of its implicit self-examinations of moral questions in the process; the film lacks the weight of works like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Thing from Another World, but its thrills never want for intelligent examination of human behaviour under duress.

A series of rocket ships designed to collect information while orbiting the earth have been falling back to the surface almost as quickly as theyve been launched, an occurrence soon explained by presence an extra-terrestrial species hovering nearby. Secretly planning to take over with as little force as necessary, the invaders only use force when fired upon by a typical belligerent knee-jerk US military, and quickly, their malicious intentions send scientists scrambling to discover a means to defend the earth against such technologically superior beings. Nuclear power is never explicitly invoked in the film, but a question of what if hangs dreadfully over the proceedings as the destruction ensues, begging reflection on the effectiveness of first attack versus the necessity of weapons as a means of self-defence.

Admittedly, to some people it is a very silly film, but to me I totally disagree, especially as it has some really spectacular special effects, so I feel it is a great deal of fun to watch, thanks mainly to the genius of Ray Harryhausens superbly animated saucers, yet in his autobiography he makes it quite clear that this was his least favourite film: A prime fascination to me was the challenge of seeing just how interesting one could make an inanimate object such as a rounded metal spaceship. Although the variations were limited for stop-motion, they did provide the potential for doing something a little different than the other flying saucer pictures of the time. The film can also be seen as a counter-argument to The Day The Earth Stood Still [1951], in which Hugh Marlowes character was wrong not to trust the alien who landed in Washington D.C.

The credible cast also includes Donald Curtis, Morris Ankrum and John Zaremba, but right now Id like to focus on the voice of the aliens, the talented Paul Frees who, from the fifties to the seventies, was kept busy dubbing dialogue for other actors: He re-voiced Humphrey Bogart (who was suffering from throat cancer) in his final film The Harder They Fall [1956]; replaced Tony Curtiss Josephine dialogue in Some Like It Hot [1959]; and re-recorded Toshiro Mifunes voice for The Battle Of Midway [1976]. Unlike many voice actors who worked mainly for only one studio, Paul Frees worked extensively with some of the greatest animation companies of the last century, including Walt Disney, Walter Lantz, UPA, Hanna-Barbera, Filmation, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, DePatie Freleng, Jay Ward and Rankin-Bass. In fact, Paul Frees was still actively working until his sudden death in 1986 from heart failure.

Animator Willis OBrien, who passed away in 1962, lived long enough to see some of his former pupils success, though most of the early films on which Ray Harryhausen worked were comparatively minor. But in the late fifties Ray Harryhausen, along with the producer with whom he nearly always worked, Charles Schneer, had a breakthrough film, The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad [1958].

EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS [1956] is certainly not the first film to show elliptical spinning ships buzzing around bewildered researchers. But it does achieve repute from Ray Harryhausens memorable stop-motion animation and photographic effects, as well as the archetypal designs for wrinkled spacemen in stiff-armoured suits. Thanks to this forefather of science-fiction, many of todays CGI extravaganzas have a foundation for crafting their own twists on the concept of sadistic creatures from the unknown bent on world domination.

EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS was well received by the audiences and critics alike at the time of the films release and the Variety publication noted that the special effects were the real stars of the film and now viewing this Blu-ray disc, I agree with that comment. The simple-minded story of the alien invasion being thwarted by a scientists sonic solution that looks to modern audiences a very basic scientific technique to fight back against the alien invaders, but it is still has a very entertainment value, especially of the master works of the genius of Ray Harryhausen, who went onto play a major role in subsequent fantasy and Sci-Fi genre films, many of which are still considered to be great classics and remain memorable examples of his work. They include: The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad [1958], Jason and The Argonauts [1963], The First Men in The Moon [1964],  The Golden Voyage of Sinbad [1973], and Clash of The Titans [1981], to name but a few. I would like to thank the genius of Ray Harryhausen for his inspired profession work in Stop-motion animation.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment brings you this wonderful Blu-ray with an equally wonderful 1080p encoded image, with an equally superb 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Also you have the choice of either watching the film in Black-and-White or in the Colourisation processing which I really enjoy viewing and I cannot understand why people are so negative about this process. Restoration has been successful, running damage out of the frame. Specks of dirt or scratches have been relegated to stock footage. All of that aside, this Blu-ray disc looks to come from a relatively high resolution source, the master was capable enough for the format with some grandiose texture on the saucer models and facial close-ups. The effect is similar to noise reduction at its peak, although lacking the usual aggression of that process. The grey scale affords the images with great. Blacks are superb, and contrast vivid without blotching sections of the video. Shadow detail is totally preserved and as for the colour and leaving the Colorization processing debate aside, saturation is clean especially with the usual pastel quality to the flesh tones.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment brings you this wonderful Blu-ray with an equally wonderful 5.1 TrueHD Master Audio. The hums of spaceship technology pan overhead in this wholly wonderful sound experience, making it feel as though saucers are really there, so making it totally fun and very enjoyable. The Alien machines are all over the sound field, spreading to all of your speakers. Explosions really breach the high-end, although there is a slightest hint of muffled sound activity when they crash into the water to give them a modern splash. Laser blasts sweep through the newly mixed channels without hiding the original mono sound track. Static, hiss, and pops are all cleaned up from the ageing material, dialogue is preserved from its low-budget roots. All of it stays in the centre without the mixers breaking from the frontal nature of the camera work.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Feature Film in Colour and Black-and-White.

Audio Commentary with Ray Harryhausen, Film Producer Arnold Kunert, Visual Effects Artists Jeffrey Okun and Ken Ralston: Here Arnold Kunert introduces himself and informs us that he is with three of his friends, who introduce themselves, and also inform us that they are here to talk about the colourization the classic Sci-Fi film EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS that was produced by the genius that was Ray Harryhausen who of course chats about his involvement with the film as they all watch it. They all talk about the use of seeing the flying saucers at the beginning of the film, which Ray points out it is very unusual early on with most Sci-Fi films that seeing the flying saucers in films are very reluctant to do so until about half way through the film. They all ask Ray who made the flying saucers and Ray informs them that he designed the saucers that were made out of Aluminium and his father made them on his Sears, Roebuck & Company Lathe. The biggest saucer was 12 inches in diameter and there were three medium size saucers and three very small saucers for the long distance shots, and they were only 3 inches in diameter. They of course get on to talk about the screen credits and of course the business of Bernard Gordon who was blacklisted and now his name has been reinstated on the credits on this Blu-ray release. They also talk extensively about the stock shots used throughout the film and of course ray tells them that the reason they were used is because of the studio heads had a tight grip on the budget for making the film. They ask Ray about all the photographic images of The White House, Washington D.C. and the Pentagon and asked Ray if he was given permission to take these photographs and to be allowed to use them in the film and Ray answers them back with a big emphatic NO. But Ray also informs then he had to take the photos himself, as he could not afford to pay for a professional cameraman to take the photos. When we see Hugh Marlowe and Joan Taylor go down into the basement where all the pipes are featured, Ray informs us that this facility was actually a redundant sewage plant and even at the time of filming, sewage was still entering the pipes, which the three in the room thought that the smell was terrible, but Ray never commented about this. But one thing Ray did inform us that he suggested he record the noise of the pipes and that is what was used to give the sounds of the flying saucers, which amazed the three other people in the room with Ray. They talk about the different stock music score you hear in the background which were uncredited and we are told that it was from other Columbia Pictures films that included compositions from people like David Raksin, George Duning, Max Steiner, Mikls Rzsa to name but a few. As we get to the end of the film, they all say, thank you for viewing this colorized film with us and we hope you enjoyed our running commentary like we did. Well I say to that, that it was quite interesting hearing everyones comments, but sometimes they go very silly and a bit over the top, whereas Ray Harryhausen was really the only sane and sensible person who came out with the most intelligent and sensible replies out of the group. But despite this, it is still quite an interesting audio commentary.

Special Feature: The Hollywood Blacklist and Bernard Gordon [2007] [1080i] [1.78:1] [29:27] We hear why the screenwriter Bernard Gordon [1918  2007] American screenwriter and producer and for much of his 27-year career, toiled in obscurity, prevented from taking screen credit by the powers-that-be who were the Hollywood Blacklist for his political beliefs, and therefore his credits were removed from the films, and his best-known works are screenplays for the films Flesh and Fury, Earth vs. the Flying Saucers and 55 Days at Peking. In this look at this ludicrous situation, Del Reisman of the Writers Guild of America explains the ins and outs of Fifties communism inspired paranoia. Through his friendship with writer/entrepreneur Philip Yordan, and Bernard Gordon found regular work as a writer and producer in Madrid for the Samuel Bronston Productions. At first, however, he was still denied screen credit, with Philip Yordan frequently listing himself as sole author of films like Circus World, Battle of the Bulge, Custer of the West and The Day of the Triffids. Bernard Gordon did receive on-screen credit for 55 Days at Peking, and the first screen adaptation of The Thin Red Line. As a producer, Bernard Gordon made a number of westerns in Spain and the well-received sci-fi thriller Horror Express, co-starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Another film he wrote, Cry of Battle, was playing at the cinema in which Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested by Dallas police on 22nd November, 1963. Bernard Gordon's blacklist-era work remained relatively anonymous until journalist Ted Newsom happened upon the man behind the assumed name Raymond T. Marcus (a name under which Bernard Gordon wrote or co-wrote). When the Writers Guild of America took up the task of correctly crediting pseudonymous screenwriters from the 1950s and 1960s, awarding retroactive screen credits to them, Bernard Gordon received more after-the-fact credits than any other blacklisted writer. His first film to receive posthumous credit was The Day of the Triffids, originally credited to the film's producer, Phillip Yordan. Bernard Gordon subsequently wrote two autobiographical books detailing the 20-year surveillance of him by the FBI, and often spoke publicly about his experiences. He helped lead the fight against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Lifetime Achievement Award to Elia Kazan, who cooperated with HUAC during the blacklist era. Sadly Bernard Gordon passed away on 11th May, 2007 in Hollywood, California. All in all this is a fascinating look at the life and times of the genius people that lived and worked in Hollywood and especially Bernard Gordon and Del Reisman is very articulate on telling us about the great black stain on that period of time in American history, which was The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) that was created in 1938 to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having Communist ties.

Special Feature: Remembering EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS [2007] [1080i] [1.78:1] [21:25] Here we find Ray Harryhausen [1920  2013] talking about the good times he had and the hard work into bringing his pet projects to fruition. Ray Harryhausen talks about his dear friend Charles Sneer [Producer] who use to cut news items out of the newspaper about sightings of flying saucers, and wondered if they could make a film about this phenomenon, and Ray Harryhausen was very enthusiastic about the project. We also get to hear from John Canemaker [Filmmaker, Author & Historian] and talks extensively about the genius that was Ray Harryhausen, and how he was also a very generous person, but most importantly how Ray Harryhausen wanted to make the flying saucers look realistic, and in this interview Ray Harryhausen has two of the small models in front of him and demonstrates how with his Stop-motion animation made the flying saucers look like they were actually flying and was a very time consuming process. We hear that Ray Harryhausen designed the alien space suites, and who coined the term solidified electricity in reference to the external suits that the aliens wear, and also informs us that it was all a load of old hogwash and just wanted to come up with a name to sound very scientific. We see Ray Harryhausen and a book signing convention and especially signing books for very young fans and really enjoyed attending these special conventions. Stan Winston [Special Make-Up Effects Artist] talks about his inspiration on why he want to pursue a career in films and it was all down to the genius of Ray Harryhausen, who he really admires and especially being the genius he was. Frank Darabont who is a French-Hungarian-American film director, screenwriter and producer who has been nominated for three Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award, and also gives great praise to Ray Harryhausen and who he also thought was a total genius and inspired Frank Darabont to work in the film industry. All in all this is again a very fascinating insight into the life and times of Ray Harryhausen and is a must watch.

Special Feature: Interview with Joan Taylor [2007] [1080i] [1.78:1] [17:29] Joan Taylor the actress talks about her life and career with this very nice personal interview, and first talks about the two specific Ray Harryhausen this actress appeared in and mentions that it is now well over 52 years ago the films were first released and now being retired has not done any acting for a very long time. But one thing Joan was very surprised that anyone wanted to being asked to do this personal interview and was very happy and a nice gesture to be asked. When Joan was a very young child, dreamed of being a Shirley Temple and was a very keen tap dancer. We find out her father owned a cinema and at the weekends always went to the cinema to watch the films being shown and was totally enthralled to see all the Hollywood actors up on the big screen, and of course dreamed of being up their also with the stars on the silver screen. Over time Joan studied very hard, especially at music, dancing and did lots of shows for the USO [United Service Organization] which is The USO Show Troupe and is part of an American tradition that goes back 75 years to its beginnings in the muddy camp shows of the South Pacific, but the USO shows that Joan appeared in was where she lived in Illinois that was between the great lakes and the troupe would perform in the Military Hospital Wards for the young men who were badly injured very badly and it use to upset Joan very much. Eventually Joan moved on and moved to Pasadena in California and was warned there was no chance that Joan would not be allowed to perform at the Pasadena Playhouse, which is a historic performing arts venue located 39 S. El Molino Avenue in Pasadena, California, but with grit and determination, eventually performed in the Pasadena Playhouse, and this was in 1946 and performed there for 3 years and at the time met her husband and admits it was the best thing to happen to Joan in getting married to her husband. Eventually Hollywood beckoned and with her friend Victor got a part in a film with Randolph Scott, and this is where Joan learnt her craft, especially with all aspects of her acting career. Suddenly we get a notice appear on the screen, where it states, Joan Taylor reminisces about working at M-G-M on its 1954 musical Rose Marie, which was directed by Mervyn LeRoy, with choreography by Busby Berkeley and starring Howard Keel, Ann Blyth, Bert Kahr and Fernando Lamas. Joan tells us that she had a great time working with Howard Keel and bert Lahr, who Joan thought was a really very kind and lovely man. When Joans contract with Paramount Pictures, went freelance, and came into contact with the producer Charles H. Schneer and of course got a part in the film EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS, and found Hugh Marlowe a really wonderful actor, and one key thing Joan learnt from Hugh and especially being involved with the SAG [Screen Actors Guild] because he was a very big in the union business, and because Joan was asked to do some extra scenes in a her lunch break, Hugh stepped in and would not allow Joan to do that extra work, but overall, Joan really liked Hugh Marlowe, because he was very professional in his acting career and a joy to work with. Joan remembers the time in EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS, and working in the locations of Washing D.C. and the Pentagon and had a marvellous time, but there was a downside because having to be delayed because of a hurricane, was not able to attend her daughters first birthday celebration and vowed this would never happen again. The following year Joan appeared in the film 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH [1957] and appeared with the actor William Hopper, who was the only child of actress and Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, who was the American actress and the newspaper gossip columnist, and Joan also had a great time working with William Hopper, who felt he was also a very professional actor. Joan finally gets round to mentioning her family and especially her husband Leonard Freeman and the father to their three daughters and also was the man who created the TV series Hawaii Five-0 and Joan was very proud of her husband being involved in the very successful TV series.

Special Feature: The Colourization Process [2007] [1080i] [1.78:1] [11:02] Ray Harryhausen and folks from Legend Films discuss the colourization process in films in general. Here again we meet Ray Harryhausen and talks about his films to be finally turned into the colorization process, and how pleased he was with the more up-to-date process, compared to when colorization first started, which was not very good at the time, but now have gone into leaps and bounds, and Ray Harryhausen that if they had a bigger budget they would of shot the films in colour. We also meet Barry B. Sandrew, who is the founder of Legend Films which is a San Diego-based company that was founded in August 2001. The company specialises in the conversion of feature films, both new release and catalogue titles, and commercials from their native 2D format into 3-D film format utilising proprietary technology and software. We hear all about the very intricate technology process details on how via a computer they add the subtle colours to a black-and-white film and we meet Rosemary Horvath [Creative Director] at Legend Films. All in all this a really nice and fascinating insight into the company that is the pioneer and recognized leader in the restoration and colorization of classic black-and-white films.

Special Feature: Original Screenplay Credits [2007] [1080i] [1.78:1] [3:16] In the 1950s, hundreds of actors, writers and directors were blacklisted by the Hollywood studios for their political beliefs and forbidden from working within the motion pictures and television industry. The actual co-writer of EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS, along with George Worthing Yates, was blacklisted writer Bernard Gordon, whose credit has been restored with the original DVD release, and now with this Blu-ray disc release. As the following original credit roll shows, film audiences in 1956 saw the name Raymond T. Marcus, a Bernard Gordon acquaintance, receive co-writing credit for the film EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS. So what you get to view is the beginning of the film until the actual film starts after the credits have finished.

Special feature: FLYING SAUCERS vs. THE EARTH Comic Book [1080p] What you have to do is use the Left and Right arrow keys on your remote control to navigate through the 15 pages of the Comic Book. Enjoy! If you press the centre arrow under the Comic Book images it takes you instantly back to the menu. What you view looks really fascinating, as it is a totally different story to the film and it was a shame they could not have been allowed to turn the Comic Book images and storyline into an actual film.

Special Feature: Galleries [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [23:20] Here you have two different categories that consist of Advertisement Art Photo Gallery and Production Photo Gallery. You can either play each category separately or Play All. What you get while viewing the images is the audio soundtrack of the film EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS.

Blu-ray Trailers: Here you get to view a selection of four Blu-ray trailers, which are as follows: SONY Pictures Home Entertainment Blu-ray Disc is High Definition [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:24]; 20 Million Miles To Earth [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:00]; It Came from Beneath the Sea [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:03]; The 7th Voyage of Sinbad [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:41].

Special Feature: BD-LIVE: BD-LIVE is a feature on Blu-ray discs that allows new content to be downloaded to the Blu-ray player. BD-Live features include movie trailers, automatic firmware updates, featurettes, games, and more.

BONUS: ChromaChoice: You have the facility to use the Angle button on your remote control to toggle between the colour and black-and-white versions at any time!

Finally, EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS [1956] is of its time and the acting is slightly stiff, and the Mischa Bakaleinikoffs film music score helps to move the film along. Overall though EARTH vs. THE FLYING SAUCERS is well put together and is a lot of good fun from beginning to end, and feel it has its place in the Sci-Fi genre and of course in 1956 things were so different to what we see in the cinema today and I personal think it is a Sci-Fi classic of its time, that was helped with the genius that was Ray Harryhausen and it has now gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

These improvements in restoration have afforded preservationists and conservationists an opportunity to do more than remove scratches and improve the image quality. It is now possible to restore a film and make it look as if it were done in color to begin with. That's the case with ""EvFS.""

I simply cannot tell, watching the color version, that this was not the way the film was shot to begin with. And the best news of all is, that if you don't like the color version, you still have the original black and white version on the same disc. The best possible compromise is no compromise. You have both formats available to you.

The film itself is a little silly in places. It was, after all, designed to be popular with a young audience. But the seeds of today's advances in computing and space travel are there. Finally, Ray Harryhausen lent his talents to the stop-motion effects and no Harryhausen film should be missed. Overall not quite a five, but darned close.",1465516800,2,1099,4.7486910994764395

711647,4,6303686850,"Personally, I think it'd be rad were we to meet any armed and threatening power with tea and cookies. So I'm at odds with the military figure who dropped that above remark. Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers released in 1956, during an era redolent with sci-fi invasion flicks. A top shelf production, Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers is refreshing in that it shies away from the somber and message-y vibe of, say, The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and It Came From Outer Space (1953). Sorry, but, most times, I prefer my extra-terrestrials to be incredibly nasty and ill-intentioned. Which they are in this one. You can keep your ""Klaatu barada nikto,"" thanks. When the weird alien voice broadcasts in simultaneously multiple languages and repeats the same message over and over - ""People of Earth, attention... look to your sun for a warning."" - I get no sense of peaceful overtures.

What's Project Sky Hook? It's a scientific stab at addressing what man's bump of superstition has been long subjected to: the strange lights in the sky, be they St. Elmo's Fire or will-o'-the-wisps... Project Sky Hook is an ambitious endeavor by which man - or, specifically, Americans - embarks, on baby steps, on a mission to explore the outer reaches of space. Spearheaded by Dr. Russell A. Marvin (Hugh Marlowe), Project Sky Hook launches twelve unmanned probes in continuous orbit around Earth, their purpose to gather all manner of astronomical data. But, ominously, one after the other, the probes crash back down to earth. Soon, the terrifying culprit surfaces: flying saucers armed to the teeth with destructive energy rays. Can man's science and military might stave off extinction at the hands of an advanced and hostile alien race, these survivors of a disintegrated solar system? We have a  deadline of 56 days.

This is a neat movie. The acting is serviceable and Joan Taylor as Dr. Marvin's bride of two hours sure is stunning to look at. The film acquires a feel of authenticity, of that documentary vibe, with its liberal usage of stock footage of military bases and rocket tests and such and by Paul Frees's dry, authoritative voiceover narration. But, all that aside, the primary hook - and the real star - is stop-motion animation wizard Ray Harryhausen whose brilliant technical effects lend these saucers sleek motion and a sense of predatory menace. Harryhausen's saucer design has become so iconic that it's the image we reflexively come up with whenever there's mention of spaceships or UFOs. But credit the man, too, for sculpting convincing miniatures of landmark structures like the Capitol Building and the Washington Momument. His fantastic attention to detail delivers that extra impactful frisson when the saucers swoop in to demolish them. But fret none. Thanks to our troops and to good ol' gumption and know-how and an outlandish destabilizing device and a power outage that allows our scientist hero to decipher the aliens' language, we come out on top. I'm gonna celebrate with tea and cookies.",1443312000,,3011,4.9821073558648115

This movie stars one of them, I saw it when I was a kid. I think I saw it a the Capitol theater on F street in Washington DC.  But I was sure it was a Richard Carlson flic, so I could be wrong.

When this first came out the special effects were pretty impressive. The reason this was so was because movie goers want to believe that what they are seeing is real, It is only much later when we have all seen much better visual effects that a movie such as this begins to look cheesy.

712857,5,6303686850,"First off, unlike some of the posters here, I found that there is a menu option to see the film in the original B&W.  As for the colorization, that was overseen by old Ray Harryhausen himself who selected the blue green colors for the alien ray guns.

This was a favorite from childhood and I never saw it on TV.  The flying saucers were so slick!  The premise wasn't bad, either.  The remnant of a civilization only about 100 years ahead of us decided that conquest was their best bet for survival even though our environment was barely tolerable.  UV light and high gravity seemed to be a problem.  They could barely walk around.  Their translation computer gave away too much -- the clue that their gravity control and time dilation necessary for interstellar travel were from characteristics of magnetism we had not suspected.  That meant that while we could not compete with their technology we still had the means to interfere with it.

The premise is good enough to supersede the inconsistencies in the film.  Were they married the morning of the launch or the night before?  Why are they so domestic as if they were a long standing married couple?  This was the 1950s and living in sin aka shacking up was very, very bad.  Sneaking to a motel and signing Mr&Mrs John Smith was the right thing to do.  When the afternoon meeting is over at the Pentagon Dr. Marvin is taken to his hotel and we see people wandering in and out in the early evening.  When he gets to his room he starts the radio and from the Greenwich time cited it is 3:30am EST.  This is confirmed when he leaves to meet them at 6am.  That elevator ride up to his room must have taken 10 hours.

But I like the way the script writers handled the characters after a flying saucer got right in their faces.  With as few words as possible they decide they are not people who see flying saucers and whatever and they will try to continue as normal and not talk about it so they won't think about it or think about not thinking about it.  It's much better than if they had said, ""People will think we are crazy!""",1416355200,,2080,4.406824146981627

Everyone should see this one. It's on a par with the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, 'The Thing (1951)', THEM! and almost with 1953's War Of The Worlds and The Day The Earth Stood Still.

What's not to love about the great, one and only, deservedly legendary Ray Harryhausen?

The ability to skip instantly back and forth from original B/W to Colorized is an interesting feature. If your dog can work the remote, that feature can keep your dog entertained for hours.

Seriously, this is a classic and also a lot of fun. If you enjoyed the DC-smashing mayhem in MARS ATTACKS!, well, here's the original of all that Washington monument-wrecking.

Almost as much fun are the general scenes of 1950s America-- clothing, cars, and social manners. It's a great time-capsule of American life in the '50s.

A wonderful couple of hours, endlessly re-watchable, and time well spent. The perfect 1950s alien-invasion movie.

This is one of the lesser entries of the Harryhausen animated films with a substandard script and shallow acting, especially from the lead, Hugh Marlowe.  The point of the film is its special effects, which in this instance, aren't anything very special and this picture looks hurriedly made on the cheap.  Many aspects of the movie are unabashedly borrowed from superior films such as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953).

713483,4,6303686850,"This movie is one of my favorites from when I was a child.  The images of flying saucers attacking Washington DC stuck with me for decades (and in fact, the scenes are basically stolen again for ""Mars Attacks!"").  While Mars Attacks! is a bore, Earth vs. the Flying Saucers has a distinct 1950's charm to it.  From the idea that 1950's technology could somehow match the civilization of an interstellar race to the boss marrying his secretary employee,  it's a snapshot of an optimistic yet paranoid time long gone by.

One of the more interesting scenes involves a ""differential analyzer,"" a primitive type of computer seen both here and in ""When Worlds Collide"" (another great classic sci-fi movie).  Today, we have phones that are way more powerful than a device that took up half a room.  There's reel to reel tape recorders, V2 style rockets, and some primitive but effective special effects miniatures.

The plot is fairly simple:  aliens intend to force the Earth to surrender, and make contact with a rocket scientist to act as their go-between.  Earth decides to resist of course, so it's up to the rocket scientist to come up with a way to drive the invaders away, culminating in a spectacular battle in Washington, DC.

Today, we know far more from movies about things like lasers, kinetic energy weapons, computers, etc. so this movie definitely will feel dated to today's more sophisticated audience.  But it's still enjoyable as a classic and as a snapshot of the life/society was like back then.  It's practically begging for a modern remake that isn't a boring parody (I'm looking at you, Mars Attacks!).  Definitely a must own for fanatical movie sci-fi fans, for someone looking for something to entertain young kids (a few people do die though), and for people who just like older movies.

713654,4,6303686850,"This is one of the better sci-fi films from the 50s.  Really good effects for the time but not much emotional impact- the aliens are monotone and dumber than the humans. I wish more vintage sci-fi films were available to rent or stream.  It's fun comparing the best of the current films to the pre Star Wars.  Actually, they can be compared only in terms of the state of the art at the time of their making. Some of the alleged sci-fi films today are little more than action movies (in the tradition of the 1930s Flash Gordon serials) wrapped in computer-generated special effects packages.  In other words, a lot of the current story lines and dialogues are less than stellar. Starship Troopers is first class formula big action; the storyline involves earth's demise at the hands(sic) of alien bugs. Plus the characters are appealing and the dialogue fits.  Ender's Game has bugs that had tried to do us in, but bares little relationship to Starship Troopers other than the sci-fi genre classification. For Orson Scott Card newcomers, the Ender's Game film as it was made would be hard to get a feel for. If it were 20 minutes longer, the makers might have been able to render it appealing to a broader audience. On a one to five system, I'd give the following films 4.5 stars: When World's Collide; The Day the Earth Stood Still; The Thing (circa 1951); War of the Worlds (1954); This Island Earth; Them!; It Came From Outer Space; Star Wars (first three); Close Encounters of the Third Kind; Alien; Starship Troopers; The Matrix; Ender's game. There's a lot of dystopian movies set in the future, some of which I'd rate 4.5 ( Children of Men; Road Warrior; Terminator;- maybe a 5 on the last two). However, they don't involve sci-fi so much, but rather the actual or soon-to-be dytopian circumstances. For anyone who likes vintage sci-fi,the 1950 film Rocket Ship X-M is a must see- it was one of the first post Roswell sci-fi films. Amazon sells the dvd cheap. Crude effects but good enough for a Hugo nomination 50 years later (2001). It's a 4.5 film for me, but the IMDB rating is 4.9 out of 10. I give the Earth vs  Flying Saucers a 3.5.  I just can't put it in the same class as the likes of The Thing et al. Or even Rocketship X-M.",1385510400,,2241,4.532178217821782

You sure would have to be on patient guy to film much of this in stop-motion.

I liked the plot and the acting was pretty good as well. Cinematography had a few interesting angles, etc. This is considered a B movie by some but if's B it sure is a very good (and famous) one!

No special effect can give a story that underrated trait.  The influence this piece had on such films as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) and ""Independence Day"" (1996) is clearly evident.  Above all else, this movie is fun and serves as an example of one of the few science-fiction films before Stanley Kubrick's ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" (1968) & George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" (1977) that brought legitimacy to that genre.  {Indeed, the blu-ray comes with a substantial amount of bonus material that will satisfy fans.

The story is not much to brag about. Aliens come to take over the world. A scientist invents a ray gun of sorts to shoot them down. Personally, I was kind of rooting for the aliens while they were destroying DC. :)

Yes, the plot and the dialog cry out to be MYSTI-ized (maybe it has been). But the colorization, which I normally abhor, is done deftly and improves this classic, leading to something like a suspension of disbelief.

714398,5,6303686850,"I would like to weigh in on the two-disk set of this 1950s cold-war extravaganza about UFOs that fuel our fears of the unknown. Many documentaries about UFOs are now available, and Amazon offers some excellent ones: OUT OF THE BLUE, DAN AYKROYD UNPLUGGED ON UFOS, and the Ancient Mysteries segment titled UFOS -- THE FIRST ENCOUNTERS which is hosted by Leonard Nimoy. Since I already gassed on about this last entry, and since others gave brilliant reviews of OUT OF THE BLUE (unquestionably the best of the lot), I won't dwell on those here. Nor will I give a straight critical analysis of EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS as a film in itself; the other reviews here on Amazon are so well-done that I find little to add.

As a kid, I saw the monochrome version of this excellent alien invasion film in my father's small-town movie theatre, just as I saw 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH and IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA -- all Columbia releases and all given the Ray Harryhausen treatment in the special effects department. Usually, I am not in favor of colorizing a film. Even Ray himself said he would not favor colorizing the all-time classic CITIZEN KANE because the moody black-and-white cinematography by the venerable Gregg Toland is an integral part of the cinematic experience. Some films need to remain in black-and-white, like many film noir productions. I mean, how would the dark vision of Hollywood told from the first-person perspective of Joe Gillis (Willian Holden) who has been murdered -- SUNSET BOULEVARD -- appear in color, or even such hard-boiled tough-guy thrillers like OUT OF THE PAST? Even another film about Hollywood, THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, narrated in a manner similar to CITIZEN KANE, would lose its texture if colorized. The list -- including but not limited to other 1950s sci-fi giant creature films like TARANTULA, THE DEADLY MANTIS, THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD, THE BLACK SCORPION, BEGINNING OF THE END, KING KONG, etc. -- could go on forever. However, Ray says in an interview that he not only favored colorizing EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS and the other two black-and-white monster movies mentioned above but actually sat at the computer to assist in the process. The result, as we have seen here, is remarkably more subtle and convincing than those black-and-white films rendered in color by Ted Turner and company years ago. In this regard, I have to agree with Ray.

As I mentioned at the outset, I would like to comment on the two-disk set which I purchased, particularly extolling the virtues of the companion disk. Like the two-disk set of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES (my favorite horror/sci film which I reviewed elsewhere on Amazon), the companion disk is as compelling as the main feature and certainly quite informative. Although it features interviews with the master himself -- interviewed at one point by none other than Tim Burton, the most unkempt-looking but singularly unpretentious director in recent history -- it also includes interviews with actress Joan Taylor who appeared in two of these films, a discussion of the musical score and how Columbia had no similar sci-films in its library to draw from, and even a discussion of how press-books or press-sheets were printed and utilized by theatre owners. This last addition was particularly a treat for me. As a boy, these press-books that arrived at our small-town theatre which showed ad layouts for the newspaper, lobby posters that could be ordered from National Screen Service, and even news stories that could be run in the local paper were a treasure for me. I clearly remember the lobby cards, the 14 x 36"" sheets, and the black-and-white 8 x 10 still shots from the films. After all, it was my job to put them up in our lobby. Later, I became acquainted with the one-sheet and the three-sheet posters, although the latter were too large for our small venue. What an exciting trip down memory lane to watch the narrator explain these to the viewers of the DVD. If possible, I would like to use this segment from the companion disk to show to my students when I again teach a film studies course here in China. Since there are no subtitles to accompany this second disk, I will no doubt have to do some considerable explaining. As I tell people, however, when they thank me for pointing out errors in grammar on papers or when I write letters of reference for colleagues, that is my job.

Ray Harryhausen's job was to be an animator, and he did his work by hand -- using stop-motion techniques that pre-date the CGI effects that we see in films today. Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam, primo directors who use their own style of animation in their films, extol the virtues of this pre-CGI method of making the unreal come to life on the screen, so I don't need to add my appreciation here. All of the fans who continue to view his films on DVD know about his genius, and the many filmmakers like Steven Spielberg, Burton, and Gilliam acknowledge his influence on their work. Even Tom Hanks has expressed his praise for JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, listing it as one of his all-time favorite films. As youths, we were all blown away by such Dynamation color fantasies like JASON, CLASH OF THE TITANS, THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD and its many sequels, MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON, THE VALLEY OF GWANGI, et all.

If you are not only a fan of Harryhausen's films but also a film scholar (amateur or professional) interested in what went on behind the scenes, you will find the companion disk to be as valuable as the main feature. Of course, EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS is no 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or even CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND; however, it is still a worthwhile piece of 1950s memorabilia. If you are a behind-the-scenes junkie, the companion disk is icing on the cake. You don't even have to put your brain on hold while watching.",1276732800,2,5865,4.730205278592376

A scientist (Hugh Marlowe) struggles to convince authorities of an imminent alien invasion after he's contacted by sinister beings who threaten the entire planet.

Typical 1950's B-movie fodder, with stock characters and a predictable narrative arc, directed with humdrum efficiency by Fred F. Sears (THE GIANT CLAW).

I refuse to buy this product.  Colorizing black and white films is childish.  Refusing to watch a film because it is in black and white is even more childish and reveals intellectual laziness.

What can this encounter mean?  What are the consequences if they do not figure it out soon, as ""Earth vs. The Flying Saucers""?

Why brain teasers? Watch when Maj. Huglin, Liaison Officer (Donald Curtis) is fool enough to look up when he is inside the saucer.

This movie has just about everything you need for a good sci-fi film.  It has a 50's feel (probably because it is a 50's movie.) It has Ray Harryhausen effects Vs nondescript CGI.  And you recognize Hugh Marlowe from ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"".  At one point you can say don't look up (oops too late).  More to the point, it is just down right fun to watch.

Of course, this film was made before Blu-ray yet it is a perfect candidate for the big screen and high definition. There is no fuzzy filming in this presentation.

714529,4,6303686850,"The term ""B Film"" covers a lot of ground considering it includes practically all genres and has varying degrees of quality(there should honestly be different letter grades of film).  In the realm of 50s sci-fi/horror, there are endless amounts of B films.  Earth vs. The Flying Saucers has always been considered one of the best of those, even enjoyed by critics and people who wouldn't watch a film like, say, The Crawling Eye.
The title pretty much describes the plot to a ""T""-Saucers are circling the Earth, and in the tradition of 50s films, the army simply open fires on them, no questions asked.  The aliens attempt to make contact in order to engage in a friendly takeover of Earth(in most films, the aliens don't try to be civil about their takeovers in the beginning.  These guys have a bit more class).  When they realize that Earth isn't gonna simply roll over for them, the gloves come off.  Earth gets it's tail kicked by evil alien saucer technology until the Earth people gradually learn more about their technology and through brainiac Hugh Marlowe, begin to develop weapons that can be effective against the invaders.
This is indeed a very fun movie.  The Ray Harryhausen saucers look great.  This was probably the Independence Day of the 50s in terms of visuals.  The story, while simple, is above average, the acting is also good.  What's also interesting is that the science and science babble isn't as corny and unbelievable as it tends to be with other films of this type from this time period.  The aliens themselves are cool, sporting very smooth, bland, faceless and stiff looking metallic suits.  Not to mention the sinister death ray!
This new DVD edition is a good value as well.  The picture is nice and clear, and you get a Ray Harryhausen interview conducted by fanboy, Tim Burton.  This is one of those Sony discs that has that ""ChromaChoice"" option of watching the film in it's original Black and White, or in a new colorized version(It Came From Beneath The Sea and 20 Million Miles To Earth are the other two so far).  Personally, the only thing I hate more than remakes are colorizations.  Though I would never watch this colorization more than once out of curiosity, it is probably the best colorization I've seen.  So, the (Chroma)choice is yours!
For fans of 50s sci-fi, this is a must must must see.  For fans of the film, this DVD is a very worthwhile purchase.",1240790400,,2402,4.705741626794258
714663,5,6303686850,"Having seen all of Ray Harryhausen's films 50 to a 100 times, I welcomed an edition that featured a color version(overseen by Harryhausen) and including the black and white version as well. This film is typical 50's sci-fi, but Ray's wonderful effects take it to another level. The saucers that Ray animated have a very unique quality and once seen are unforgettable.

I remember seeing all of these films on Saturday afternoon Creature Features through my youth. Long before I knew who Mr. Harryhausen was, It was obvious that films featuring his effects were always a cut above the rest!

This edition looks very good and seeing the film in color is a treat for fans who have seen these films a number of times. The edition has some very good special features, but does not carry over any of the features from the last edition, which would have been nice and would make discarding the older one much easier. The good thing is most of the stuff on the older edition is on many of his DVD's, so more than likely you'll still have them.",1240444800,4,1035,4.559139784946237

Directed by Fred F. Sears and starring Hugh Marlowe (Dr. Russell A. Marvin) and Joan Taylor (Carol Marvin),  the 1956 release has solid special effects that features a number of iconic landmarks crashing down due to the flying saucers essentially being destructive Frisbees.

Dr. Marvin coordinates a project to send rockets into Earth's orbit, which will ultimately assist with the exploration of the universe. But the rockets begin to disappear and it turns out that some wily aliens are causing the turmoil in space and are also itching for a fight with the Earthlings.

The power of the aliens is incredible and the Marvin's may end up the only people left alive after the one-sided brutality is over. With the focus on bogus negotiating ploys, sneak attacks and the unleashing of ultimate weapons of mass destruction, the movie masterfully mixes elements of the Cold War into the Sci-Fi thriller.",1234483200,,954,5.057324840764331

They look pretty primitive.

The acting is respectable considering the three stars - Hugh Marlow, Joan Taylor and Donald Curtis - are anything but ""stars."" I do think the story could have used a bit of humor to spice it up a bit, but you can't always get everything.

714669,4,6303686850,"First thing's first, as a movie it has many flaws, but of course you can't expect perfect Hollywood cinema here. But in terms of just plain sci-fi fun, this movie triumphs. Harryhausen's effects are as wonderful as always.

Now to ease your curiosity, I'll be the first to admit that while I'm 100% against the colorization of classic B&W films, they did a rare and remarkable job here. Every scene was carefully supervised by Harryhausen himself to make sure the colors are as authentic and sensitive to the film's integrity as possible. He also points out in the DVD extras that he also hates the idea of colorization, but this movie, as well as 20,000,000 Miles to Earth (another classic Harryhausen picture also colorized in the same process) were always meant to be filmed in color. Budgetary constraints made color filming impossible. The fact that this movie was filmed in B&W was not an artistic choice, but an economic one. So from that perspective, you can appreciate what they tried to do. Of course it's nice that you can get to choose from color and B&W. I would have knocked off another star if that weren't the case.

The actual video quality looked a bit soft to me though. I don't know if this is how the original film looked but I was expecting a bit more detail because it's from a new high-def master (clips from 20,000,000 Miles to Earth in the bonus material looked much crisper). This is nitpicking though. It certainly still looks great and the slightly soft nature of the video quality never detracted from the enjoyment of this film.

As for the sound... it ROCKS! Of course don't expect Lucasfilm quality sound, but considering this is a remix of a monophonic source, it's quite enveloping and effective, and really took me by surprise. The saucers truly swoosh over your head and there's an adequate amount of subsonic rumble when appropriate. Of course the original mono source is included for purists like myself, though I found the new 5.1 mix to be far more effective and I highly recommend it over the mono track.

Bonus material is just adequate. Nothing terribly worthy of note, but most of it is definitely welcome and interesting material.

All in all, it's a decent package, though in my personal opinion, a tad overpriced. It should be $15 at most. I bought this for $7 at Walmart around Halloween and they had the other colorized Harryhausen films at that price. I was shocked to find out it was only a Halloween special price and that they actually retail for $22 (with the Blu-ray versions costing only a dollar or two more!). I should have picked the other ones up when I had the chance... but oh well. It's your call.",1227657600,3,2661,4.665245202558635

714822,3,6303686850,"EARTH VS FLYING SAUCERS-(Special Color Edition) was a good old sci-fi movie that I would consider a 3 to 4 star film. The great DVD transfer and new color process provided for a great show on a large screen TV and was very enjoyable. Those not in favor of colorized old B&W films should hear Ray's opinion on this matter, as he now says that if the low budget had permitted it, all of his films would have been in color.

The commentary was also very enjoyable as were the opinions expressed that today's more up to date sci-fi thrillers could learn a thing or two about making effective use of time and saving money by using stock film shots, and other tricks of the low budget trade at which Ray was a master.

However, who is kidding who? Ray turned out masterpieces of hand crafted and lovingly made movies that never could be produced today for the price of his labor. He made these films for next to nothing and was happy to do so for the same reason that other artists have been successful. He loved creating these movies and employing other people in larger financial circles to get them onto the big screen.  In doing this he was demonstreating what he was capable of doing with his technique.

On the other hand, today's films are truly mind blowing and are the result of bringing together teams of talented people working for a combined financial fortune. Hollywood doesn't have to be told that they could learn a thing or two from Ray. Hollywood pays what it currently does in order to make a return on their investment, and the results (with all its inefficiency, unused footage and redundant shots) are worth it.

I am happy to see a product where money is almost no object, coupled with the fact that it pays for itself in the end.  This is the reason we can expect to see great future sci-fi films supported extravagantly by Hollywood, and paid for by the fans at the box office.

In this way top notch talent (acting, direction, film editing, set design, special effects, CGI, music, etc.) can be brought to bear producing the best possible result without the sorry constraint of cost. Modern sci-fi films are a good example of capitalism at its best, and I say bless it. I have been told by marketing people that the public will gripe about the cost of bread and fuel, but are often willing (when able) to pay almost anything for their entertainment).",1216944000,,2369,4.521028037383178
714823,4,6303686850,"Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers is pure 1950's B movie fare.  The plot and acting are campy, the budget is minuscule, and it's filled with 50's sci-fi clich&eacute;s, but the film had one thing going for it, and that was the stop-motion wizardry of Ray Harryhausen.  Harryhausen's incredible talents made this film rise above other similar films of the era that have been long forgotten.  Make no mistake about it...there's no way this movie would be released on a two DVD special edition over 50 years later without Harryhausen's involvement.  The newly-remastered set comes with an incredible array of special features that puts most new films to shame.

The thin plot centers around Marlowe's character of Dr. Russell Marvin, a scientist working with the U.S. Army.  Martin is launching rockets into space to begin gathering information for man's eventual travel into space.  However, almost as soon as the rockets reach space communication is lost and the rockets come crashing back to Earth.  Marvin and his wife, Carol (Taylor) have also had an encounter with a flying saucer and they soon put one and one together and determine the aliens are shooting down their rockets.  The aliens relate their tale to Marlowe when they explain they have come to Earth to take over...in a nutshell.  Dr. Marvin and a group of other scientists rush to complete a weapon that they hope will disrupt the alien's gravitational fields.  This all leads to an all-out battle in Washington DC with some of the Capitol's most well known landmarks being destroyed.

In truth, Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers is a fairly slow moving picture up until the final fifteen minutes or so.  Saucers are seen flying casually around, barely creating a panic as if people see them every day.  Occasionally they land and unload a group of plodding aliens in suits who shoot out death rays as soldiers.  It's Harryhausen's effects that are the star of the film.  His saucers have a spinning action with the top of the saucers moving one way and the bottom moving the opposite which truly made them appear as if they were flying, compared to the usually ship on a fish line type of movement.  The explosions and destruction of the Washington Monument and Capitol building are the landmark scenes from the film.

The movie doesn't have the all-out death and destruction of War of the Worlds and it certainly didn't have the same caliber of acting, but it also didn't have nearly the budget of that film either.  While the film was shot in just a few weeks, Harryhausen continued to work on the effects for months afterwards.  This isn't a great film from a plot or acting standpoint.  There's little in the way of character development and the science is laughable by today's standards.  It's still an entertaining film for those that appreciate Harryhausen's unique talents.

Extras:  Wow!  Where do I begin?  This is one of those releases that make you rejoice in the DVD format.  First, the film comes in either the original black & white or new colorized format.  This new Chroma-Color process is vastly improved over the old colorizing process of 10 or 20 years ago.  The colors are not gaudy but look natural, especially the skin tones.  When you see shots of the sky you don't just see a solid blue with white clouds but subtle gradients of color.  What's cool is that you can toggle back and forth between color and B&W by pressing the ""Angle"" button on your DVD remote.
The film comes with audio commentary with Harryhausen and visual effects artists Jeffrey Okun and Ken Ralston.

Harryhausen was noted for using stop animation and this was one of his earlier efforts. The effects would be nothing special today but, in their time, they were considered amazing. The destruction of Washington DC is nothing like that from INDEPENDENCE DAY but it does get the point across.

This is not great art but it is a trip down memory lane. Be sure to check out the special features on Harryhausen. They are worth the price of the DVD.",1175558400,,1064,4.446153846153846

715104,5,6303686850,"This film does not need more reviews, but I can not help myself.  It is one of my all time favourites.  Unlike many of Ray Harryhausen's films, it is not just a special effects vehicle, but a very solid science fiction thriller, straight out of the paranoid 1950's sf school.

This was one of Harryhausen's earliest films, coming just before he went into colour with The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.  It benefits from solid (if unremarkable) acting, and even more from a basic script that covers every base it should.  As a result, it has been copied (i.e., ripped off) about a zillion times.  Even Tim Burton paid it homage in his Mars Attacks (a film I find almost unwatchable).

The fifties was a paranoid era for the US, with an overriding fear of communism coming just after several yeras of horrific war.  Just as the Japanese used Gojira (Godzilla, in the US version) to personify certain fears and themes, Harryhausen and crew used flying saucers. Where the Japanese film was somber and sad, however, this effort was strictly an entertainment.

The film works just like the best science fiction short stories and novels from the period.  Odd things are seen in the sky, leading to alien contact (misunderstood) with Dr. Marvin and his sweetie.  Misunderstandings with the aliens leads naturally to them attacking.  The movie's plot is fast, believable (as long as once accepts the premise) and full of steady surprises, skipping quickly from one major plot point to the next.

As noted, Harryhausen was really coming into his own here, with his budgets increasing after the success of The Beast from Twenty Thousand Fathoms and It Came From Beneath the Sea.  The saucers are excellent, in particular for the sense of movement he gave them.  The most is made from a small budget.

For my money, Harryhausen's handcrafted special effects rule!  Today's CGI work looks increasingly like toons, with little individual character.  If you've never seen this film, buy it--you're in for a treat.",1168732800,,1993,4.880952380952381

715107,3,6303686850,"One of the things I argue about with my kids is the need for scifi/fantasy to have perfect effects, which is the disease of our nearly plotless formulas that come out these days.  There are great exceptions, of course, such as Star Wars and Harry Potter.

This film is one of those old wonderfully raw ones, which I used to watch afternoons after school with a sense of fear and awe.  While the effects are light years from what we expect as a minimum today, they are fun if you let yourself enjoy them, which occasionally my kids do.  It is kind of campy for us, and we do talk about them as well.

However, the 1950s shiboleths notwithstanding, this is a flawed film.  First, the plot isn't all that great:  the aliens are simply evil, though there are some fun subtlties to their technologies and methods.  So there are few surprises.  Second, the acting in my view was awful:  wooden dialogue delivered without style, stereotypical characters that are easy to label, etc.  I mean, the acting really is abysmal.  Third, the effects are not nearly as fun as those in RH's later films, as this was so low budget.  Nonetheless, they are far better than the Ed Wood style films in that they aim for serious scifi and they do have atmosphere.

Recommended with these caveats in mind.  It is all in fun.",1149033600,,1300,4.495726495726496

715200,4,6303686850,"In the mid-'50s, Columbia released a trio of nifty black-and-white ""monster"" movies:  It Came from Beneath the Sea, Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers and 20 Million Miles to Earth. Aimed squarely at the youth market, each of these films run less than an hour and a half, and are brave and spunky as they feature a human race that always survives and is better as a result of the battles with the monsters. Most importantly, each has spectacular special effects by the master, Ray Harryhausen. In the years before computer-generated graphics, monsters were either created by very sophisticated cartoons, or, in the case of Harryhausen, a technique called ""stop action,"" in which models would be shot a frame at a time; natural movement was suggested by moving the figures slowly, frame by frame. This was time-consuming, painstaking arduous, and for non-fans, pretty cheesy.  But the cheesiness is, in a way, more than half the fun. Populated by such grade B through Z performers as Hugh Marlowe, Faith Domergue and William Hopper, these movies are a comfy as a pair of old slippers and a well-worn robe. These quick morality tales are a hoot and holler; a campy, yet and faintly embarrassing, art form that demands the clich ""so bad that they're good.""",1136160000,2,1247,4.877358490566038

715205,5,6303686850,"""Earth vs. The Flying Saucers"" debuted in July of 1956 and it's easy to see why it was a fairly successful film for it's time.  Capitalizing on the wave of UFO sightings that were sweeping the country at that time, ""EVFS"" had to have had an impact on a large number of paranoid Americans.

The strength of the film, of course, in found in the believable saucers concocted by the great Ray Harryhausen.  So believable, in fact, that the viewer slowly forgets that the saucers are only an effect and not really in the picture.  Harryhausen was a master at mixing light and background with his effects and displays that genius in this film!

Rather than go into the plot of the movie (which has been done and overdone by previous reviewers), let me suffice to say that this film needs to be judged by the technology that was available at that time.  Sure, it special effects are primitive compared to today's computer-generated blockbusters, but that shouldn't detract the viewer from appreciating the film on it's own level. One can definitely see the effect that this film had on the production of films like ""Independence Day"".

Unlike many of the DVD's of the 1950's Sci-Fi films produced today, ""EVFS"" contains some great extras.  In particular, the ""Harryhausen Chronicles"" are almost worth the price of the disc alone.  This semi-documentary gives the viewer some great insight from first-person interviews with Harryhausen.  His great imagination and wit jump off the screen as he gives the viewer the background secrets to the creation of some of his greatest special effects.  Also included are vignettes on the ""making of"" EVFS with Harryhausen and Joe Dante and ""This is Dynamation"".

This is great stuff and should be a part of every Sci-Fi collection!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1108857600,2,1783,4.903333333333333
715206,4,6303686850,"The 1956 Columbia Pictures presentation of ""Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers"" plopped itself down into the midst of an America that was largely on tenterhooks because of very real Communist expansionist activities around the world (hence the spectre of an ""invasion"" mentality), as well as an America steeped in the awareness of strange things being seen in the skies since the mid-1940s (sporadic signtings of weird ""airships"" or ""flying chariots' go far back into history, but EN MASSE incidents dated only to the Second World War in the skies over Europe...to little silver disks sailing through Allied bomber formations, to larger light balls soaring about everywhere, seemingly with ""intelligent guidance""...things called ""ghost rockets"" and ""foo fighters"" that the Allies thought were German secret weapons, and the Germans thought were Allied secret weapons).
In June of 1947 an Idaho businessman named Kenneth Arnold was
involved in a Civil Air Patrol search near Washington's Mt. Rainier, helping the US Air Force in searching for a downed cargp plane, when he saw a group of strange aircraft sail past the mountain in an echelon formation like geese or ducks. He was close enough to tell they weren't birds, but crescent shaped metallic ""whatzits"". Arnold reported them, but believed they were some sort of classified, experimental aircraft on maneuvers.
The government denied this. In talking about these things he'd seen, Arnold said the ""craft"" (crescents, mind you) kind of moved forward through the air in a skipping sort of motion ""like if you spun a saucer out (frisbee style) across the top of a pond and it skipped scross the water"". Well, he used the word ""saucer"", and the things were supposedly flying, so the media put the two concepts together and the term ""Flying Saucer"" was born.  The implication being these ""must be"" the craft of some kind of people from outer space. But what did they want? Why were they here? Imaginations were left to run wild with that...as well as memories of H.G. Well's novel ""War of the Worlds"" and the terrifying radio program done of it in the 1930's by Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre Players.

  People got a little ""antsy"" over these things (justfiably so) and interest in them was high (still is). The Air Force was charged with investigating this situation and set up several projects to investigate them, the most famous being Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio. Early on the AF had somewhat of an open policy with the public about ""these things"". but in 1952 that changed radically. In the summer of 1952 the greater metropolitan Washington, DC, area was besieged by ""saucers"" for several days in July. They were all over the skies over Washington and on out into the Virginia and Maryland countrysides. Jets took them on and got outflown and outmaneuvered. Rumors persist to this day that there were ""shootdowns"" on both sides. Maybe. Maybe not. In any event, after that wild summer the government cracked down big time on UFO reporting. The policy became ""Deny it. Deny it all"", the same policy that exists to this day. Project Blue Book was turned into nothing more than a ""discrediting agency"" for ""PR"" purposes and the real AF UFO investigation switched to a NEW unit, the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron, a group whose existence was only discovered in the past decade or so. It has operated under various code names, ""Moon Dust"", etc., ALL ALONG, while the public was told that THE ""investigating agency"" (Blue Book) had been SHUT DOWN in 1969 on the recommendation of a spurious, CIA-controlled ""Scientific"" Investigation at the University of Colorado. All this Colorado horseplay did was write official ""finis' to Project Blue Book, the OFFICIAL AF UFO research project. But ""deep black"" clandestine government UFO investigations continued...and continue NOW...in full swing...under various covert code names. Surprise, surprise, the government lies! But not just ours...they ALL do!

  The 1952 D.C. incident was made prominent in a classic expose book called ""Flying Saucers From Outer Space"" by Marine Corps retired Major. Donald Keyhoe, and this later formed the basis for the screenplay of ""Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers"". ""Earth"" , in cranking out an exciting SF adventure for the younger crowd, does a sizable bit of exaggerating on what what really went on...with saucers destroying national landmarks in DC while the AF and the Army use newly brainstormed rayguns to shoot them down. Its an Us-vs-THEM shoot-em-up showdown in the sky.
The war-of-the-worlds scenario of a dying race looking to relocate on Earth was the basis for this invasion plan, and it works fine enough in this capacity in this film. The stop-motion animation effects by Ray Harryhausen are excellent for their time and technology level. Harryhausen's work is always a treat and is no less spectacular here than in any of the Sinbad series entries or any of his big gorilla or dinosaur work.
  Hugh Marlowe (From ""Day the Earth Stood Still"") stars here and does a fine job in one of the few SF movies of the period that doesn't star either Richard Denning or Richard Carlson (or both). All supporting roles are handled competently.
  ""Earth"" delivers all the thrills, chills, excitement and goosebumps you could ask for in a B-level potboiler and if you want to stuff yourself with hot chocolate and popcorn in front of the old idiot box while it rains a river outside sometime, pop this oldie-but-goodie in your DVD player, kick back, relax, and enjoy. It's a lot of fun.",1103068800,6,5547,5.005422993492408
715207,4,6303686850,"Almost 50 years ago (1956), Fred F. Sears (1913-1957) directed one of the more memorable sci-fi B-movies entitled ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"", which was based upon the book ""Flying Saucers from Outer Space"" written by Donald E. Keyhoe (1897-1988).  (A retired marine officer, Donald E. Keyhoe became an advocate of government alien-cover-up conspiracy theories.)  At only 83 minutes, film audiences were treated to a fictional scenario that focused on the U.S. being invaded by strange, powerful, humanoid aliens that arrive in seemingly unstoppable, spinning flying saucers (about 100 feet in diameter).  They are first encountered by a husband & wife scientific team, Dr. Russell A. Marvin (Hugh Marlowe, 1911-1982) & Carol Marvin (Joan Taylor), who are testing high-altitude rockets.  After Carol's father, Brig. Gen. Hanley (Morris Ankrum, 1896-1964), is kidnapped by the aliens, they realize that they must find a way to combat the aliens to stop their impending invasion of Earth (by attacking Washington, D.C.) using their powerful disintegrating-beam weapons.

Though the film is entertaining, it does suffer from several obvious flaws that are due, in part, to a weak film budget:

1. The armored aliens walk stiffly like robots, or if they are suffering from severe arthritis.  This doesn't make them seem very menacing, except for their disintegrating-beams that can emanate from stiffly raised arms.

2. The notion of a spinning flying saucer does not seem like a very comfortable way to travel. Unless the aliens can counteract basic physical laws of motion (as described by Sir Isaac Newton, 1642-1727), it would be very difficult to maintain a non-spinning interior with a fast-rotating exterior of the ship.  This was the basic physical law that had to be overcome in order for helicopters to be feasible.

3. Though quite entertaining, the alien attack on Washington, D.C. includes a supposed, nearby U.S. military counter-attack.  However, the stock footage used was of rockets being launched from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and anti-aircraft artillery that is located in a mountainous desert-southwest location.

4. The alien invasion itself appears stopped after only about half a dozen (or slightly more) alien flying saucers are downed.  Given the amount of effort that would be necessary for an invading alien force to successfully invade and subdue an entire planet, a successful invasion seems rather ostentatious, foolhardy and fruitless with only a handful of ships.

Despite the flaws, the film's ability to entertain was due in large measure to the visual effects supplied by Ray Harryhausen; whose other film visual effects include the 1963 ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963), ""One Million Years B.C."" (1966) and ""Clash of the Titans"" (1981); as well as a descent script written by George Worthing Yates (1901-1975) & Bernard Gordon.  (Bernard Gordon was one of the unfortunate victims of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's, 1908-1957, House Un-American Activities Committee.)  Though memorable as a B-movie, ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" is not on the same par as some of its better contemporaries that include ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951, which also starred Hugh Marlowe), ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953) or ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956).  It was, however, one of the inspirations for Tim Burton's humorous 1996 sci-fi spoof, ""Mars Attacks!"".  Overall, I rate ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" with 3.5 stars out of 5, rounded up to 4 stars.",1098144000,6,3482,5.288566243194192
715349,4,6303686850,"To add to what FlickFlack (NM, USA) said previously:  The most obvious evidence of top and bottom clipping can be seen early in the movie when Dr. Marvin (Hugh Marlowe) is describing, with the use of an animated graphic, how his ""birds"" (satellites) will be orbited around Earth.  In the original film and the VHS tape, you can see the complete circular orbit paths.  In the ""widescreen"" DVD, the graphic has been significantly butchered.

The IMDB ( [...] ) says that ""Earth vs"" was originally shot at a widescreen 1.85:1 ratio, but they've been wrong before.  E. Lentoni (Long Island) in the preceeding message says that it was filmed at 1.33:1.  I don't know who's correct, but I do know that I've never seen a true widescreen version on either tape or disc.  Although many 1950's films were shot at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (the same shape as a TV picture tube, as a matter of fact), there were a lot of wider formats after about 1953.  With the introduction of the DVD, I've certainly seen the ""shortscreen"" version.

Here's an irritating fact:  Assume that the original film really was 1.85:1.  Then trim the edges to make a fullscreen 1.33:1 image for the VHS tape.  You have just removed 28 percent of the picture, leaving 72 percent.  Now take that reduced image and trim the top and bottom off to make a ""fake"" widescreen 1.85:1 DVD image  This is what Columbia did.  You have now reduced the image to 72 percent of it's already shrunken size, and 52 percent of the filmed size.  That's what you get with the DVD- only about 52 percent of the original filmed picture remains.  You've lost essentially HALF of the picture information!",1097193600,12,1644,4.633217993079585

As reviewer FlickFlack (NM, USA) pointed out, the top and bottom of the film were basically chopped off or 'blacked out' giving the impression of a widescreen version.  I have this film also on vhs.  I used an A/B switch to compare the versions while they played concurrently.  The vhs vesion, which is in the original aspect ratio, has MORE to see.  Respectfully I disagee with FlickFlack that not much important info is lost on the dvd.  To my eyes I believe some pertinent information WAS lost by changing the aspect ratio of this film.

  Anyway, I'm just trying to help.  I wouldn't have bought this dvd had I known what Columbia Tristar did to this movie.

715351,4,6303686850,"""Earth Vs the Flying Saucers is a classic - read most of the other reviews.  The Columbia Pictures (Columbia Tristar) release of the DVD contains a very good transfer, with picture quality as good as one could get from a 50-year-old film, and the sound quality is much better than the video tape, so it's worth buying for those reasons.  BUT...

The IMDB (Internet Movie Data Base) says that the film was shot at an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and the image seen on the TV screen does indeed seem to be about that shape.  However, Columbia's claim that this is a wide screen DVD is false.  The DVD's image is exacly as wide as my full screen (1.33:1) VHS copy (from Good Times Video).  The difference is that Columbia has just chopped off the top and bottom of the full screen version to make it look like wide screen.  The full screen VHS actually contains more picture ""information"" than the ""wide screen"" DVD.  If you are buying the DVD thinking that you'll see a wider picture than is on the full screen tape, you'll be disappointed.  You will see nothing new.  I must say that you don't really loose much important stuff, but on the other hand you're certainly not gaining anything- the information that was cropped from the original film to make the full screen tape is still missing from this ""wide screen"" DVD.",1094256000,11,1314,4.529661016949152
715352,5,6303686850,"Released in 1956, ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" was the second film visual effects genius Ray Harryhausen did with producer Charles Schneer. They had previously worked together on the gigantic octopus vs. San Francisco film ""It Came from beneath the Sea,"" and would go on to craft a long series of color fantasy movies that remain favorites with all ages today. ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" (or ""E v. FS"" if you prefer) arose from Schneer's interest in the flying saucer-sighting craze of the day. Curt Siodmak, author of many of Universal's classic monster films, hatched the original story of a full-scale invasion by alien craft, but the final script is credited to George Worthing Yates and Raymond T. Marcus. Harryhausen found himself animating not monsters, but futuristic spacecraft. Thus, the film is quite a departure from his usual fare, but nevertheless Harryhausen infuses the movie with his genius and personality. ""E v. FS"" is the ESSENTIAL alien invasion flick of the decade, far more entertaining than George Pal's stuffy ""The War of the Worlds."" Everything you want from 50s science-fiction flick is here, and with Harryhausen's visual effects, it all looks damn cool too!
The husband and wife science team of Hugh Marlowe and Joan Taylor (both fun performances) investigate a rash of saucer sighting. The aliens have come to Earth to seek aid, but when they land the trigger-happy military opens fire and the aliens retaliate with a ruthless war of destruction. But don't fear, our peppy scientist couple have come up with a wild invention that may stop the destructive alien visitors. It all concludes in a wild scene over Washington D.C., and not all the monuments end up in good shape.
Ironically, Harryhausen doesn't have very positive feelings about the film: ""It remains for me the least favourite of all our pictures. There is a dividing line between science fiction and fantasy, although they can occasionally overlap.... Fantasy has a poetic appeal radiating romance and warmth, whereas science fiction, with all its preoccupations with machines, politics and scientific apparatus, has a tendency to reflect coldness and indifference.""
Well, Ray is certainly entitled to his own opinions about his work and his preferece for fantasy, but I think ""E v. FS"" works amazingly. There's a general giddiness about it, and a sense of invention, that speaks directly to modern viewers tired of the overblown and grim action and science fiction films of today. Harryhausen's flying saucers astonish, moving with jittery speed and very animated motions. The aliens themselves wield awesome technology, like death rays, brain probing beams, and vibrating shields that protect their ships (stunning effects, all of them). The budget limitations resulted in alien suits that are bit simplistic, but they still work. And the finale in Washington is a humdinger. Harryhausen's models and the intricate portrayal of the destruction still look astonishing. He even manages to make creative use of stock footage, instead of merely relying on it for a cheap shortcut as so many other 50s science fiction pictures did.
This excellent DVD presents the film in its original 1.85:1 format (I'll bet you didn't know it was a widescreen film) enhanced for widescreen TVs. Also included is ""The Harryhausen Chronicles,"" a feature-length documentary on Harryhausen's work; it appears on all of Columbia's Harryhausen DVDs, so you might have seen it before. New for this DVD is an interview between Harryhausen and director Joe Dante (""Gremlins""). It's short, but you learn some great secrets about the film straight from its creator's mouth, and you also and get to see the original saucer models. Dante also shares his personal memories about seeing the film as a child.
This is a must for any Harryhausen fan or anybody who loves the 1950s Golden Age of alien invaders.",1082505600,76,3873,5.1394611727416795
715353,4,6303686850,"""Warning! Take Cover! Flying Saucers Invade Our Planet! Washington, London, Paris, Moscow Fight Back!""  That's the tagline for the film Earth vs The Flying Saucers (1956) directed by Fred F. Sears, who also acted in and directed a whole mess of B westerns throughout the mid 40's through the mid 50's.  This film stars Hugh Marlowe as Dr. Russell Marvin, head of the military operation called Skyhook, a project involving launching a series of satellites into orbit around the Earth, paving the way for manned expeditions into space.  I remember Marlowe best as Tom Stevens from the 1951 quintessential sci-fi film, The Day the Earth Stood Still.  Joan Taylor, who is very easy on the eyes, I might add, plays his secretary and recently wedded wife, Carol Marvin, and was in another Harryhausen classic, 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957).

The plot involves flying saucers coming to Earth with nefarious purposes...does this sound familiar?  It should, as we've seen it so many times before, in films like Independence Day...the plot for that Emmerich film is basically lifted from here, with main difference being the inclusion of tons of special effects to dazzle audiences (which they succeeded, even with this viewer).  Anyway, there is miscommunication, things happen, words are said, and the aliens start blowing stuff up...blowing stuff up real good.  Bad aliens...but they didn't want it to be this way.  They were hoping for a friendly takeover, but us Earthlings don't take kindly to technologically advanced beings from outer space in their fancy-schmanzy flying/spinning discs throwing their weight around our neighborhood.

One thing that really surprised me about this movie is that it was really well scripted.  The whole story was intelligently written, and almost believable.  The writers, dealing with the fantastic elements of the story, didn't seem to over reach their grasp, and seemed to allow for enough detail to keep the viewer from saying ""Yeah, right..."" in disbelief.  Also, there were no real over the top performances, drawing the viewer out of the story.  I have to admit, though, the appearance of the numerous saucers didn't seem to illicit the reaction I would have expected, one of terror and fear of this great unknown...the effects by Harryhausen in this movie, considered by some not to be among his best, worked most effectively for me.  The saucers, the destruction of various Washington institutions and monuments, really looked wonderful.  They displayed a charm you just don't see anymore with computer-generated graphics nowadays.  The aliens might have seemed a bit hokey, in their metal, robot-like suits, and the production values may have been lacking at times, but the well-crafted story, tight dialogue, and superior acting compensate nicely for this, allowing for most viewers to enjoy this science fiction classic.

There are numerous special features, including an hour-long documentary, ""The Harryhausen Chronicles"", detailing Ray Harryhausen's career in films, from his earliest days working out of his parents garage to his latest achievements.  There is also a featurette called ""This is Dynamation"", which basically shows what 'Dynamation' is, and how it was used in various movies.  Also, there are some trailers and a neat little photo gallery.  The picture is in wide screen format, and looks beautiful.  I am unsure if any restoration was done for this release, but Columbia should get credit for releasing such a fine print on DVD.  Oh yeah...if anyone ever asks to show you their 'Knowledge Index Accumulator', take a pass...alien no goodniks...

Several sattelites have been lost in strange ""accidents"", causing concern, but not enough to postpone another launch. Marvin and wife encounter a flying saucer on their way to the space-lab, which they inadvertantly record on tape. Later, the saucers appear at the launch site, causing military types to open fire immediately (of course). Both men and guns are obliterated by the invaders' superior firepower. Marvin finally figures out that the burbled noise on his tape recording is actually the aliens trying to communicate with him. Too late! The invasion is under way. Mrs. Marvin's father (an army general) is abducted and zombified by the aliens, after they've sucked his mind dry (We get to see the ship interiors. Check out the cool, ultra-modern viewscreen!

Filmed in gorgeous black and white, and coming out two years before the Technicolor blitzkrieg of War of the Worlds, EVTFS is still superior on just about every level.  The special effects, laughable to some who judge only by today's standards, are still eye-popping.  The first half of the movie is mostly dialogue driven and is designed to up the suspense ante by stages.  The second half is the reason to see it as the flying saucers (and Harryhausen!) pull out all the stops and go whole-hog on the invasion.  The painstaking model work is just extraordinary, especially the destruction of the capitol building.  Although an obvious product of the coldwar and the McCarthy eras, the movie, with its Us vs. Them mentality, is still very relavant today.  You need only look at the headlines about American foreign policy to see this.  Although EVTFS may come across as an exercise in coldwar paranoia, I would like to think that it is an exercise in optimism.  For anyone living in those times and having to face the fact that almost two thirds of the world was on the way to becoming communist, if not already there, those must have seemed like dark times indeed.  Like its modern day version, Independance Day, Earth shows that any problem can be overcome if people just put down their differences and work together.

715358,4,6303686850,"I have heard a few people opine that EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS is their LEAST favorite Ray Harryhausen movie (Ray being the director of special effects).  I disagree for one main reason -- I saw this movie on first run, and it was a blast at that time, and at that age.  The poster for this movie is now among the most valuable in the world, along with those for KING KONG and FORBIDDEN PLANET -- because, I suppose, the artwork outside the theater promised gaudy, wonderful invasion goings-on inside.
The movie delivers flying saucers -- boy, does it.  The only saucer ever to come close to these is the one in FORBIDDEN PLANET.  It's a testament to the excellence of Ray Harryhausen's effects that the camera lovingly lingers over these magnificent machines, which have spinning internal parts and fly the way saucers should fly -- in formation, at crazy angles, and fast -- up, up and away fast!  These are saucers in all their glory.  It's no accident that clones of these saucers down to the last detail (except for the landing gear) turn up in MARS ATTACKS.  They've never been outdone.  As another reviewer put it so succinctly, the saucers are the main character.  Oh, Hugh Marlowe (who also appeared in DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL) and the rest of the cast are good, but the point is aliens and saucers, and very little time is wasted on anything else.
The other wonderful and fascinating thing about this movie is that Harryhausen chose to set the final battle in Washington, D.C. and have his saucers crashing into the various monuments -- making for some sensational imagery for viewers in 1956.  Since the scenes were mostly filmed using Ray's own miniatures, they actually look far better than some of the effects in other films of the period which attempted the same stuff -- the fall of the Washington Monument onto some unlucky tourists is particularly ""cool!""
This is a personal favorite of mine, despite its silly science and its brevity.  Frankly, my own least favorite Harryhausen film is either 3 WORLDS OF GULLIVER or even IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA -- which offer less screen time for their special effects.  And after all, at a Harryhausen movie, effects are kinda the whole point...!  ;^D",1051401600,4,2217,4.6976744186046515
715507,4,6303686850,"Ray Harryhausen, the genius behind Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, the Sinbad movies and countless others, tackles flying saucers instead of fantastic creatures in this tale of man versus aliens.
Really nifty flying saucers begin to be spotted around the world.  Who are they?  What do they want?  Our hero manages to decode one of their signals (slows it down) and determines that the aliens are peaceful.
But peaceful aliens would make for a much different story, and their true agenda is soon discovered and the Earth finds itself at war with the flying saucers.
Ray Harryhausen's special effects showing the saucers and crumbling buildings (the US Capital Building being one of the best) are some of the best he has done (although his sword-wielding skeletons are still better than any CGI attempt made so far).  Harryhausen is a true artist as well as technician and few movies have the impact that his battle of the saucers has.

715509,4,6303686850,"_Earth vs. the Flying Saucers_ is vintage sci-fi from 1950s cold-war America.  Plotwise, the title says it all.
The film's acknowledged highlights are the impressive special-effects sequences by stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen.  Harryhausen manages the difficult task of giving these flying saucers a personality of their own.  In fact, these spinning machines display more nuance and character than any of the film's human actors.  But perhaps that's as it should be.  After all, if you plan to watch a film called _Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, you're not really looking for taut psychological drama.
The extras on this DVD are adequate, but no better.  Two of the disc's three featurettes have been featured on other Harryhausen discs, so if you already own a title in the ""Harryhausen Collection,"" you'll discover quite a bit of overlap.  A photo gallery and some trailers round out the package.

715511,3,6303686850,"Although not one of Harryhausen's best efforts, Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers is better than most films from the same time frame. The script has a number of nice imaginative touches (the alien's are so frail despite their technology that they whither away if their suits are removed; the way they communicate initially with Hugh Marlowe's character is interesting).
 The effects work is top-notch although not as showy as other efforts (interestingly, when one of the buildings explodes to save money there's a quick cut to a stock shot of the destruction of the Los Angeles city hall from Paramount's War of the Worlds). Harryhausen manages to give the flying saucers character (something that can't be said about the performances by the lead actors). Made after The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and It Came From Beneath The Sea, Earth demonstrated that Harryhausen was ready for something far more ambitious.
The script is a bit stodgy and the acting capable if uninspired (Hugh Marlowe's one dimensional acting style fits well into the  static direction by b movie vet Fred Sears). Fred Sears' direction does keep the movie moving along. This was just a stepping stone for Harryhausen to his future classic films. The DVD picture is pretty good given the age of the negative and the extras are nice. Harryhausen has wisely chosen not to do an auto commentary as he has always feels it robs a movie of its magic.",1047686400,2,1410,4.870833333333334
715512,5,6303686850,"Here is a list - for people jaded by ""Star Wars""-type digital special effects and Bruce Willis-type smart-aleck dialogue - of what the classic science fiction film ""Earth versus the Flying Saucers"" (1956) does not boast: it is not processed in Technicolor but only in (glorious) black-and-white; it does not show whole cities sprung sky-high by death-rays or fleets of numberless star cruisers nuking it out among the nebulae; its aliens do not look like the dripping unsought-for results of recombinant DNA experimentation, nor are they invulnerable so that stopping them depends on a hasty ""deus ex machina"" tacked on by the screenwriters; its scientist hero and his wife are mature people, not teenagers or ""twenty-somethings"" escaped from prime-time television; they act with deliberation and do not pump air or dance a jig when their efforts prove effective; when people die in the film, they die without bravado. People who insist on such things should know in advance that their particular adrenaline-addiction will not be fixed by this film. Intelligent and discriminating viewers, on the other hand, can expect the superb model-work of Ray Harryhausen deployed economically but satisfyingly throughout the film. They can also expect thoughtful, jargon-free dialogue from screenwriters George Worthington Yates and Raymond T. Marcus, working from a story by Kurt (""Donovan's Brain"") Siodmak, and taught direction from Fred F. Sears. ""EVFS"" gratifyingly violates one of the formulas of 1950s sci-fi cinema: it does not make the audience wait to see the alien nemesis, continually postponing a disappointing appearance, but exposes its first saucer within two minutes of the opening segment. As Dr. Russell Marvin (Hugh Marlowe) and his newlywed wife (Joan Taylor) drive down a California desert highway toward the rocket test-site where Marvin directs his earth satellite program, an enormous craft swoops down on them, maneuvering around the speeding car. Both are fazed by the experience and don't quite believe their senses. When Marvin tries to launch another one of his ""artificial moons,"" a saucer lands on the grounds; soldiers fire on the robot-like aliens, whereupon the craft takes to the air again and uses its ray to blast the installation. It is while waiting to be rescued from the bunker where they have been caught that Marvin and his wife discover that their tape-recorder contains a message from aliens, beamed at them during their close encounter on the highway. The message is apparently friendly, but the aliens turn out to be intent on taking the earth by force. Marvin and his scientist cronies race to develop a weapon to neutralize the saucer-fleet, which makes its attack on Washington D.C. in the film's brilliant finale. Supporting performances come from the ubiquitous Morris Ankrum and from Donald Curtis. Ankrum appears in nine out of ten 1950s sci-fi ""B"" movies, or so it seems. (See ""Flight to Mars"" or ""Kronos."") Midway through the film, Marvin and his wife, in company with his wife's father, an Air Force general played by Ankrum, board a saucer that has landed on the beach, ostensibly on the Virginia shore. The location is actually Westward Beach, in Malibu, about a thousand feet from where I lived as a teenager, looking as deserted an alien as it is possible to imagine. It is a remarkably stark scene. The interior of the saucer is sparsely and therefore effectively conceived. The aliens regard themselves as supermen, classically ""beyond good and evil."" In the assault on D.C., Ray Harryhausen contrives to destroy every major national monument in the city. That the alien hardware is not indestructible lends the story credibility: the implication is that humanity is equal to the battle, provided that it does not panic. The DVD of ""EVFS"" includes two featurettes, ""This is Dynamation,"" about Harryhausen's signature technique, and the more specialized ""The Making of Earth versus the Flying Saucers."" Presentation is in wide-screen, a real boon. (The VHS was in pan-and-scan television format.) This is a terrifically entertaining item from the black-and-white ""alien invasion"" genre.

715514,5,6303686850,"Many of the science fiction movies of the 1950s had an effective combination of surprisingly good acting and swift pacing that runs competitively with the big budgeted but far less interesting counterparts of today. In EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS, director Fred Sears manages to use the superlative special effects of slow-motion master Ray Harryhausen as a backdrop for a tale that points the way for such future and similar movies as STAR WARS and STAR TREK.
By the the time this movie was filmed (1956), the Second World War had been over for more than ten years, but the movies of this next decade still retained the harsh, documentary film style that demanded a ubiquitous use of soldiers, tanks, and warplanes.  Typically, monster films of the 50s required a military type solution to an alien invasion, usually resulting in a reverse storming of the beachhead of Tarawa, with the defenders as the valiant but overmatched earth soldiers.  It was just three years earlier that earth's stalwart defenders failed to repel invading Martians in WAR OF THE WORLDS.  In EVFS, earth's initial defense is led by a face familiar to science fiction movies of the period--Hugh Marlowe, who had similar such roles in WORLD WITHOUT END and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  Here he plays a scientist whose technical wizardry forms the basis for a defense against an aggressive race of aliens who look like pint sized versions of the robot Gort from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  The aliens wobble along stiff legged, blasting into smithereens all opposition.  One of the most interesting parts had nothing to do with combat but everything to do with what happens when alien and human finally talk face to face.  Morris Ankrum, another well-known second banana type of the 50s, plays an army general who is kidnapped so that the aliens can pick his mind apart with a brain scanner.  The scene in the saucer in which Ankrum stands before his daughter as a modified zombie is chilling in its intensity.  Up til this point, the confrontation between human and alien which had been strictly business morphed to brutally personal.  The battle scenes that culminate in the Armegeddon type destruction that lays waste the national capital at Washington still resonate even with a generation that expects the latest cutting edge in computer-assisted special effects.  Finally, there is the believable interaction in the love interest relation between Marlowe and the lovely Joan Taylor, who plays his wife-science partner.
In judging the relative merit of any movie, the critic ought to focus on how succesfully and seamlessly that movie accomplishes its implied goals.  In EVFS, director Sears promised to deliver a thrilling movie that featured terrific special effects, a competent script and acting, and a subtext that suggests that human beings had better co-operate in the face of a common danger.  He delivered, and that is why I give it five stars.",1040774400,15,2939,4.985685071574642

It always amazes me how much cleaner and crisper the DVD version is. BUT...as I've noticed on many, many DVDs, this appears to be the common full-screen version--but with black bars superimposed on top of it. Am I missing something in movie-making? I always thought (and you can see it in truly widescreen presentations) that a full-screen cut simply is the widescreen with both ends chopped off to fit the squareness of a TV screen. On a lot of DVDs that I've bought over the past couple of years, the so-called widescreen (compared to a full-screen version) is actually missing portions of the film (the top and bottom). This DVD is the same. The sides of the screen did not yield any extra picture than the full-screen, but images at the top and bottom of the full-screen were now covered by the black bars. If someone can explain this to me other than to say that the studio is leading you into believing that it's widescreen when it actually isn't, please let me know. If not, the only reason I can think of why they do this is to save money. It must be a lot cheaper to take the more common full-screen version and digitally impose black bars on it than it is to dig up the original widescreen and digitally animorph it. I don't know.

The plot is straightforward enough: Aliens attack our planet, and it's up to the miracles of modern science to save us.  Sure, there's the requisite scientist-in-love-with-the-general's daughter subplot.  But there's also Ray Harryhausen's spinning saucers, laying waste to everything in their path.  In fact, Earth vs. the Flying Saucers is one of the few films of its kind that actually DELIVERS on the promise of an all-out alien attack.  Yes, there's a b-movie budget, complete with some stock footage of planes and such.  And the aliens' death rays aren't terribly convincing.  But such are the limitations--and charms--inherent in 50's drive-in sci-fi flicks.

As for the DVD, it's a first-rate job all the way.  A whole extra disc is devoted to numerous bonus features.  Harryhausen--still spry well into his eighties--offers detailed recollections of working on the film (he also provide audio commentary for the film on Disc 1).  There's a very interesting documentary on screenwriter Bernard Gordon, a Harryhausen interview conducted by a somewhat gushing Tim Burton, an engaging inteview with star Joan Taylor, a featurette on the film's music, and various still galleries.

Now, for the curious. . .I must address this colorization issue.  Earth vs. the Flying Saucers was filmed in black & white.  I, like many of you reading this, I suspect, grew up watching the film in black & white.  And having watched the new colorized version, I still prefer the film in its original form.  Despite the offical approval of Harryhausen, as well as documentary on the supposed improvements in colorization technology. . .I still don't think it looks that great.  Specifically, no one has ever been able to get caucasian flesh tones exactly right, and fire always comes out too yellow.  For those that think Harryhausen's ""seal of approval"" is enough to justify this change in the film, I refer you to recall the comments of two other fantasy-film masters: George Lucas and Steven Speilberg both felt modern technology could improve existing prints of STAR WARS and E.T.  But you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who agrees that end-products were improvement upon the originals.

But, color or b & w are ultimately personal preferences.  Either way, this is a terrific treatment of an often-overlooked classic sci-fi film. Buy it!",1017705600,,3033,5.840909090909091

As far as the script goes,Everything In This Film Is Explained! It requires a suspension of disbelief to buy into it but that just adds to the charm that makes these movies so great. Think of it as being written by Michael Crichton as a young boy and you'll get the idea.

If your just starting your collection of 50's sci-fi I'd say to wait on this one but if you already have War of The Worlds then this would make a great companion piece for a late-night double feature.",1010620800,4,1117,4.978609625668449
715666,3,6303686850,"So far as story goes, the title says it all, and you won't find any brilliant performances, acclaimed writing, high-concept storylines, or big budgets here.  But you will find Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion special effects, and that counts for a lot.

This is not among Harryhausen's more elaborate works--those would come a bit later in his career--but even so he creates some very interesting effects.  Unlike most sci-fi efforts, including recent ones with computer-graphic effects, Harryhausen's flying saucers actually move in a way completely unlike anything you've seen anywhere, suggesting completely alien intelligence and machinery.  In fact, the saucers are so interesting to watch they assume the role of the film's main character!

Kids weaned on Star Wars-style special effects will probably be bored by the film, and the even more forgiving fans of 1950s science-fiction flicks will find the over-all movie tepid.  But the Harryhausen fun-factor cannot be denied, and fans of his work won't want to miss this one.

715776,5,6303686850,"To begin with, I never saw this movie. And the first time that I saw it was only a small piece of it in a documentary about Sci-Fi movies on HBO back in 1980. And since VCRs were not invented yet-and even if they were I could not afford to buy one I soon forgot all about the movie.  Then back in 1996 I was fortunate enough to purchase a copy of same and I still watch it from time to time. Now as far as the movie is concerned, just like all of the other Sci-Fi movies from the 50s the special effects alone are worth a five-star rating. And the movie itself also deserves a five-star rating; because they don't make them like that anymore!",1004832000,,642,4.05511811023622
715777,2,6303686850,This movie isn't to impossible.  Starting with a content that is more believable than you could ever think.  Focusing on an event which possibly be truer than we can consider.  However man could not controll situations that are above our limited way of total and complete controll.  (But the movie has good has good story line until the end.)

715779,4,6303686850,"Alien survivors of a disintegrated galaxy attack the Earth in saucer shaped spaceships armed with death rays. Despite its pulp magazine origins, this film exceeds expectations due to Ray Harryhausen's magical special effects and a literate script. The astonishing stop-motion animation by RH is the real star of the film. The constraints of the B&W photography are a hindrance, but RH rises to the occasion. The only thing missing is a rampaging radioactive beast from outer space. The generic spaceships alone don't satisfy this wish. The aliens are covered by body armor that supports their atrophied muscles and conceal their withered facial features. Things get intense when the spaceships attack Washington. Familiar landmarks and buildings suffer explosive destruction. Conventional military hardware has no effect on the force field protecting the alien craft. Earth people suffer alien abductions, brainwashing, and thought control. McCarthy style, '50s paranoia creeps into the story. The script is otherwise intelligent, and avoids many of the typical cliches. The action moves swiftly along and doesn't waste time on subplots. Fans of Ray Harryhausen's animation definitely need this classic sci-fi flick for their collection. This is great Saturday matinee fun for 12 year old kids of all ages. Enjoy the ride. ;-)",997833600,5,1326,5.504901960784314
715780,4,6303686850,"This movie has it all:  50's special effects, lots of property damage, and a high (if mostly unseen) body count.  The aliens want to take over the world, and we won't let 'em!  Of course, the solution doens't come until we almost lose, but that's just the formula you gotta follow when you make this kind of movie.
This movie has its many imitators, but perhaps the most obvious is ""Independence Day"".
A true Hollywood ""B"" original that has heavy rotation in my home.",997228800,2,467,4.535714285714286
715781,3,6303686850,"This movie was entertaining to watch. I liked a lot of the details and concepts presented in the story, even most of the acting was all right. The storyline seemed to be fairly well developed although there were a few flaws. I did like the talk of satellites years before anyone really had them (especially the proposed satellite with a TV camera and transmitter) and the science stuff (even if it was technobabble). Our guys shot first, asked questions later at first contact all because they didn't understand the first attempted message, something that has turned up in other stories since then. In this case they were right to shoot, which is a switch. The alien ships appeared all over the world then converged on Washington D. C. for the final battle, I'd call that a low budget solution for a way to end the war. Our weapon would probably kill the operator but who knew that in 1956? I wasn't thrilled with the FX, thought that The Day The Earth Stood Still( Hugh Marlowe also in that one)did better on them, both movies good to have.",988675200,2,1041,4.572192513368984

I wish you could hear Benjamin (4 years old) say that while gently patting his mouth to warble his voice to sound like the aliens.  We must have seen this video at least 30 times.  If there's one thing in life you must remember, never stay in the raygun truck if Dr. Marvin gets out and walks away!  They always get zapped by the aliens.  Benjamin has become quite astute at finding Dr. Marvin (Hugh Marlowe) in other movies, ""The World Without End"", ""Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""Rocketship X-M"".",980812800,,596,4.5233644859813085

Whenever I watch films such as ""Earth vs. The Flying Saucers"" I'm reminded of a time when talented men such as Ray Harryhausen created amazing effects without the benefit of computer animation, but rather through labourious hours with complex models. Harryhausen's flying saucers look fantastic, and the destruction of Washington (done on a meagre budget) is equally impressive !!
Hugh Marlow heads up Earth's defence team as Dr. Russell A. Marvin (although I never forgave Hugh Marlowe for turning in Klaatu to the authorities in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" !!) as they struggle to find a way to beat the invaders through scientific methods !
Lots of fun to watch on rainy Saturday afternoons or late at night with the lights off !! Definitely a key contribution on my list of the memorable science fiction films of the 1950's !",974851200,6,1051,5.011428571428572
715784,5,6303686850,"A misunderstood message from an alien race starts a war between Earth and would be peaceful visitors -- or are they really all that peaceful? A classic B&W sci-fi supported by a good story and decent acting, this film is packed with action and sports spectacular special effects (could they be anything less with Harryhausen behind them?).
When I sit and watch this, I find it impossible not to put it into historical context as applied to stories of UFO sightings and abductions. Being filmed long before these were as commonplace in the media as they are today, I am almost convinced that many of the sighting and abduction stories we now hear are, in fact, subconsciously inspired by this film; if not, how do we explain all the similarities between these tales and salient elements of this film? Coincidence?
I must say, it's sad to see how today's kids (assuming they are kids) review many of these classic films.  I will freely admit that many of the sci-fi films of this era sport cheesy effects, and will also admit that I find these not only quaint, but a large part of the attraction. But, when films like this one get ratings like we see below, I've just got to assume that many of today's viewers simply can't tell the difference between good filmmaking and the advanced technologies of CGI.
A ""must see"" for true sci-fi fans and a ""must own"" for collectors into classic sci-fi. This film gets 5 stars from me only because this is the highest possible rating on Amazon.",974073600,,1481,4.6311787072243344
715785,4,6303686850,"Ray Harryhausen did well with his special effects despite the obvious limited budget. The script and setting are typical mid-50s look, but the movie goes along well, particularly in the latter half.
I love these old classics from the 40s, 50s and 60s, and considering all of the blood, gore and shoot-em-up they show today, if I had children, I would much rather have them watch these old movies in the days before Hollywood deemed it necessary to throw about 100 gallons of ketchup per film.
This movie won't win any awards, but it wasn't intended to. It was intended to be entertaining and to make you think ""what if,"" and it does just that.
With all of the corruption going on in Washington today, what happened to it in this movie has probably entered the thoughts of a lot of people in this country.",974073600,7,804,4.551724137931035
