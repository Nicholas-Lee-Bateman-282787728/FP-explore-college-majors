7928879,2,B000050HNY,"I have just seen this mini series, if you need to watch it because you were a fan of the series do so but don't spend this much money. It seems hard to believe that with good actors like Scott Bakula, Elizabeth Pea, Richard Thomas such a mediocre series can be made, this is proof that everybody has to pay bills. Who is to blame? The director and and a very low budget? well my money is on the director. If you must watch it like I did, try to find it anywhere else or watch it on VHS.",1477785600,,486,3.919191919191919
