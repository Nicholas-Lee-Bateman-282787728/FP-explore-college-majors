1380227,5,B00004Z4SE,"This movie is simply beautiful. It ties for best ""Cinderella movie"" with ""Ever After,"" and that's saying a lot, seeing as how I utterly ADORE that movie. I was never fond of the Disney version of Cinderella when I was a child, since it always seemed too ""easy."" But this is much more in-depth. You get to see a lot of character development here, and the strong, diverse personalities really bounce off each other well. Brandy as Cinderella is, in my opinion, an original and wonderful choice. She brings out an honest, true-to-self strength that is rarely seen. Whitney Houston is spectacular as the fairy godmother. She's magic with attitude! And, oh yes, Paolo Montalban as Prince Christopher (I'd love to see what else he plays in). He's just such a sweet dreamer (not to mention hot as all hades! lol), you can't help but smile. As the love of Cinderella's life, he's given a properly large role (he actually gets a name in this one!), more than just ""being at the ball"" and ""sending out servants with the glass slipper."" Instead, he's out there searching, himself (with the help of Lionel). He really shows that he would go to the ends of the earth to find the girl he loves, and all of us fans are there rooting for him. Whoopi Goldberg is absolutely hilarious as the Queen. Her ""enthusiasm"" for poor Chris to get married is sometimes so overwhelming for her, she loses the ability to speak, and I crack up every time. I just feel so sorry for Lionel (Jason Alexander), with everything he has to put up with (he's even pushed off a ladder, and later gets trampled on at the ball, for pity's sake). I'd be tearing my hair out if I were him, really. But, he takes it so well, and I applaud him for it. Victor Garber has a rather small role as the King, but he plays it the full extent. Quite a bit more level-headed than his wife, he uses wisdom and fairness to play ""peace-maker"" when mother and son ""disagree."" I especially liked the part where he encourages Chris to find Cinderella, ""no matter how long it takes."" What more could you want in a king? As for Bernadette Peters, wonder of wonders, a step-mother with spunk? Imagine that! So over-the-top it's comical, and, at the same time, somewhat mysterious about her past, she and her dorky, bumbling daughters add a comic relief that's quirky and unusual. All right, enough about the characterization. On to the music. I love singing along with these songs, I really do. My particular favorites were the Cinderella/Chris duets, ""The Dearest Love"" (even though they weren't ""aware"" of each other at the time), ""Ten Minutes Ago"" and ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?"" I do wish the reprises of ""The Dearest Love"" and ""Do I Love You because You're Beautiful"" were longer, though. (Whoopi's part in ""Do I"" was quite touching, showing that she truly did want her son to be happy, not just wanting him to get and produce an heir for the throne, as it was made out to be at first). The way Brandy's and Paolo's rich, emotional voices intertwine is beyond magical. The costumes and sets are extravagant, just as you would expect for a fairy-tale, yet believable. I don't usually like dresses and such, but I'd love to have that ball gown. It's just so gorgeous! It's like the original Disney gown, but a bit slimmer and more modern. The sheer, simple elegance of her entire costume is as well-presented as it is breath-taking. Very nice touch there, I must say. Oh, a couple of things before I shut my opinionated mouth. I've read a lot of the reviews for this movie, and there seems to be something of a controversy over certain subjects. One being the multi-racial cast, which I think is ingenious, myself. It's the first of it's kind, as far as I've seen. My grandmother, who can be a bit technical at times, to say the least, was a tad confused as to how a white man and black woman can come out with an asian son, but I told her it's all part of the fun. Another argument point is how this ""remake"" compares to the versions from 1957 and 1965. Personally, I've never seen these. I'd never even knew that they existed if I hadn't come to review this one. That said, I don't feel right in saying whether this ""measures up"" to it's predecessors or not. But, even so, from what I've seen from some of the other notes about it, the elder ones seem kind of stiff and formal, and the only real attraction is being taken back to your childhood. This one, on the other hand, is anything but. Spirited and fun-filled, I highly recommend this to anyone who believes in love at first sight, no matter the circumstances.",1046044800,25,4571,4.521739130434782
1380228,5,B00004Z4SE,"Fun fast paced, enchanting update and very enjoyable. Some, who have written a negative review about not being comfortable with the color and diversity of this production, sound like .... Let's see, an African-American Cinderella, strike one. A Filipino Prince, strike two. An evil White stepmother, strike three! How dare they tint a classic fairy-tale with color and diversity, which goes against your traditional vision of virtually all children classics? This production was long overdue and should be commended, not because it breaks stereotypes, but because it is a very well performed and enjoyable movie!
Brandy does a decent job as Cinderella, and evokes the charm and innocence needed to pull the role off. Whitney is fantastic (and Im not a big Whitney fan). Bernadette Peters is great as is the rest of the cast. Compared to the Leslie-Ann Warren, mid 60s version, which is very slow, sparse, and poorly acted, this version is like a breath of fresh air. My daughter has seen both versions and cant sit through the 60s version. I think those who reminisce about that version, think of it kindly because we saw it as children and it takes us back to a time of our innocence. You can find the 60s TV version at most blockbusters, but if you watch it and then watch this updated version of Cinderella, I think youll agree that this 1997 version is an improvement!",1043366400,34,1372,4.817796610169491

1380399,1,B00004Z4SE,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this version of Cinderella! The diversity, the songs, the costumes! Love it!

I didn't know where to find this movie so I was so happy to see it being sold on Amazon! The DVD came as expected, but it's a very poor quality DVD. The DVD cover insert looks as though it was probably printed off a low quality printer. The title/menu screen looks very low quality. The actual movie image is okay, but what's the worst is that during the movie, the sound cuts in and out for every other second in random parts and it's VERY annoying! The DVD is scratch-free and my DVD player plays other movies just fine.

I'm not sure if I just received a bad DVD or this is just what to expect from the product (the back of the DVD cover insert has printed that it was made in Mexico.

What I've started to do is eject the DVD to start it back up and that fixes it a little.",1520121600,3,882,4.086705202312139

The cast is wonderful (Brandy, Whitney Houston, Whoopi Goldberg, Bernadette Peters, Victor Garber and Jason Alexander are the more well-known) and not only talented musically, but also make this an adorable comedy.

1380731,5,B00004Z4SE,"I saw Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella when it first aired on television in 1997, and it is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I mean, who doesn't want Whitney Houston as their fairy godmother?  All of the actors and actresses were splendidly cast.  I was particularly besotted by Paolo Montalban, who portrayed the Prince with a grounded dreaminess (if that's even possible) that made you root for him as much as for Brandy's Cinderella.  Victor Garber and Whoopi Goldberg as the Prince's parents - LOVED their portrayals.  And Bernadette Peters - WOW! She really nailed her performance as Cinderella's stepmother.  Even all these years later, I can still remember the lyrics of the songs  :)  If you haven't seen this version of the classic tale, please seek it out!",1488931200,,775,4.862595419847328
1380732,5,B00004Z4SE,"This by far is my FAVORITE version of Cinderella.  This movie had such an impact on me growing up, to see a princess who looked like me with a Fairy Godmother who looked like me and to top it off the Prince is tall dark and handsome but not in the way that you're used to fairy tale Princes being portrayed. 5-Star all the way",1488844800,8,326,4.015384615384615

1380734,3,B00004Z4SE,"I really like this version of the musical, but many other people do not.  The people who do not like it mostly hate the casting.  They especially don't like the airy tone to Brandy's voice.  If you're expecting the Julie Andrews version, or the Disney cartoon version, then maybe your won't like it.  If you go in to it know that it will be different, you'll probably like it.",1487548800,,376,4.405797101449275

It was a welcome respite from todays uncontrollable urge to make everything edgy, I mean, don't people have enough of that in their real life? After watching this wonderful movie, I kept thinking about another playful rendition of Cinderella, or in this case Rindercella, and finally found it on YouTube (Hee Haw Cinderella Story Backwards). Its just humorous, fun, you know  not edgy!
------------
Once apon a time, in a coreign fountry, there lived a geautiful birl and her name was Rindercella. Now, Rindercella lived with her mugly other and her two sad blisters. Also in this same coreign fountry, there was a very prandsom hince.

Now this prandsom hince was going to have a bancy fall. And he'd invited the people from riles amound, especially the pich reople. Now Rindercella's mugly other and her two sad blisters went out to buy some drancy fesses, you know, to wear to this bancy fall, but Rindercella couldn't go because all she had to wear were some old rirty dags. Finally, the night of the bancy fall arrived and Rindercella couldn't go so she just cat down and scried.

She was a kitten there ascrien, when all at once there appeard before her, her gairy modfother. And he touched her with his wagic mand ... and there appeared before her, a cig boach and hix white sorces to take her to the bancy fall. But he said now Rindercella, you be sure and be home before nidmight, or I'll purn you into a tumpkin!""

When Rindercella arrived at the bancy fall, the prandsom hince met her at the door because he had been watchin' this time behind a woden hindow. And Rindercella and the prandsom hince nanced all dight all night...and they lell in fove. And finally, the mid clock strucknight. And Rindercella staced down the rairs, and just as she beached the rottom, she slopped her dripper!

The next day, the prandsom hince went all over the coreign fountry looking for the geautiful birl who had slopped her dripper. Finally he came to Rindercella's house. Well he tried it on Rendercella's mugly other ... and it fidn't dit. Then he tried it on her two sigly usters ... and it fidn't dit. Then he tried it on Rindercella ... and it fid dit. It was exactly the sight rize!

So they were married and lived heverly ever hapwards. Now, the storal of the mory is this: If you go to a bancy fall and want to have a pransom hince loll in fove with you, don't forget to slop your dripper!

1381055,4,B00004Z4SE,"I am not a person of color and I was a teenager when this came out, but I have always loved it. The Prince was charming, Cinderella was sweet, the Godmother was eccentric, and the stepmother and stepsisters were adorably awful. It's a visually-endearing version of the classic.

C'mon! Bernadette Peters and Whitney Houston in the same production?! It just disregards any question of skin color and allows enduring storytelling and undeniable talent to capture the next generation.",1460937600,,481,5.166666666666667

1381096,5,B00004Z4SE,"What can I say about this version of R and H's Cinderella with Whitney Houston and Brandy? It is amazing. I could not imagine a better cast. The step sisters and the Prince though I have not seen themelse where are really good. Whoopi is amazing as the Queen, Victor Garber is a great contrast as the King, and Bernadette Peters rocks the Wicked Stepmother. Jason Alexzander is hilarious and is amazing in his ""The Prince is Giving a Ball"" song. Brandi is fun and entertaining and really gets in to her imagination while dreaming of being the ""Belle of the Ball."" The magic and sets are beautiful and whimsical (if something could be this would be it). I have loved this movie since the first time I watched it and I am now 26. I am happy that I have finally updated this to DVD. Disney has started making the classics in to live action films and this is one of the earlier ones.
Anyway, I love love love this movie.
To say if it is better or worse than the earlier two I can't say. For one I have not seen the first and while they have the same songs and basic storyline they are so different. I love them both.",1460073600,6,1112,4.225352112676056

This story is similar to the original Cinderella only with a few comical twits. For example when Cinderella is dreaming about the ball, the step daughters get all involved. Realizing what is going on, the stepmother has to intervene. There are many more scenes in which the movie has a small, but funny twits to it.

The acting is great. The cast gets along well with each other and you can see how well all the rolls interact and play as a whole.

The costume design is another favorite. I just love Cinderella's dresses at the ball and in the end. No detail was to big or to small for this film.

Overall growing up, this was one of my favorites and it still is. I love the music and acting is amazing. This is my 8 year olds favorite.",1438128000,,909,4.177142857142857

1381493,5,B00004Z4SE,I love Whitney Houston and to make the cast a multi-national group was ingenious.  Brandy's eye makeup in one scene is too heavy and they corrected it in another but other than that a thoroughly enjoyable addition to my classics to pass on to the next generation.,1430438400,,263,4.595744680851064
1381494,4,B00004Z4SE,"In 1957, Rodgers and Hammerstein debuted their first musical made specifically for TV: an adaptation of the classic fairy tale ""Cinderella"" with Julie Andrews in the title role. However, that broadcast was a live production and done only once, and a kinescope recording aside, it was unable to be broadcast again. In 1965, the book (the script for the less-theatrical out there) was rewritten and a new television version starring Lesley Ann Warren was filmed and became a TV classic. Since then, the play has been adapted for theater as well and in 2013, a newly rewritten version debuted on Broadway.

1997 brought the third and latest TV version. Co-produced by Whitney Houston, it decided to be a fairy tale for the late 20th century. The cast is multi-ethnic (the King is white, the Queen is Whoopi Goldberg, the Prince is Filipino; the stepmother is Bernadette Peters, one of her daughters is black), but this brings a neat charm to the production. It's a fairy tale: anyone can be anything.

I remember seeing this on a black and white TV with poor reception, but when I recently got the DVD and saw it in color for the first time, my memories had pretty much filled in the right colors. It's a colorful little TV movie that almost looks like a cartoon come to life. While not highly-advanced special effects, a nice effect is done on the pumpkin becoming a carriage, and the Fairy Godmother is allowed to fly and create swirls with her magic.

The story adaptation is pretty nicely done. As I said, each TV version of this property uses the same core songs (""The Prince Is Giving A Ball,"" ""In My Own Little Corner,"" ""Impossible/It's Possible,"" ""Ten Minutes Ago,"" ""The Stepsisters Lament,"" ""Are You Beautiful Because I Love You,"" ""When You're Driving Through The Moonlight/A Lovely Night""), but a different script. This one, like the original with Julie Andrews, depicts a bolder Cinderella than Lesley Ann Warren. She goes and meets the prince (dressed as a common citizen) before the ball, and later defends her dreams to the Fairy Godmother. She obeys the stepmother, but does not buckle. In this version, she is about to leave the stepmother's home because she's tired of the abuse. (In the Julie Andrews version, she has stolen away to the palace and the prince has her try the slipper there. Lesley Ann Warren is almost too afraid to leave the house.)

This version fleshes out the story with more songs from the Rodgers and Hammerstein library: ""The Sweetest Sounds"" is sung as Cinderella and the Prince meet for the first time, establishing that both she and the prince are seeking love; ""Falling in Love With Love"" is sung by Bernadette Peters' Stepmother as she and her daughters prepare for the ball, reminding them and the audience that her desire for them to marry the Prince is for them to gain status, not for love; ""There's Music In You"" is sung by Whitney Houston as a much-needed finale as Cinderella and the Prince marry, and it nicely balances ""In My Own Little Corner."" (Cinderella sings of places she's pretending to go and adventures she pretends to have, this song contains the lines, ""Now you can go wherever you want to go, now you can do whatever you want to do."")

The core songs are also nicely used. ""The Prince Is Giving A Ball"" has always been subject to a shifting location in the musical, and here it's expanded with more lyrics, which makes it a little more lively as majordomo Lionel (Jason Alexander) calls for preparations for the ball. While the ball retains all of its songs, it repeats the feeling of perhaps too many songs in that sequence. (A grand total of three in quick succession.) Brandy's voice is rather earthy, but lends itself to Cinderella not being born a princess. Whitney Houston and Bernadette Peters are easily the best singers in the whole lot, the former knocking ""Impossible/It's Possible"" and ""There Is Music In You"" out of the ballpark and the latter wonderfully singing ""Falling In Love With Love.""

Overall, is this perfect? No, the effects didn't all age well, and not all of the writing is on point, but it's fine.",1430352000,,4088,4.742616033755274

This  version has 3 more songs than the Warren version (which is also worth seeing).
If you want to hear additional songs from Cinderella, the CD of the stage show with Tommy Steele provides them, though the woman singing Cinderella in the stage version isn't as good as Brandy or Lesley Ann Warren.",1429747200,,622,5.029126213592233

1381815,5,B00004Z4SE,I remember watching this when it was first broadcast on the ABC Wonderful World of Disney's Sunday Night Family Movie.  I know it's not 100% true to the Rogers and Hammerstein musical but I have a huge fondness for it.  The cast is just as fantastic as I remember and it's a fun and silly movie to sing along to.,1413849600,,312,4.183333333333334
1381816,5,B00004Z4SE,"I mean...look at the cast...look at the talent...forget the naysayers...(it's a sad new low for a certain ""Western"" country who shall remain nameless as the typical populous who cannot stand the look of beauty which has been around longer than most left behinds will ever understand)...okay enough with that....Get it for Whitney, Whitney, and Whitney...oh, and did I say Whitney.

 Truly beautiful and special collection to add to your library.

As a UK person, this is what we expect of beauty around the world and the REAL WORLD tells the other world, to ""get over it""...it is what it is...and this goes for the dig on ""I'm not a ""whitney"" fan"" (to THAT comment we say from the UK...then why bother to have even included that nonsense).

Whitney Houston has an incredible fan base despite what her own country betrayed her as being.

Heck, they gave a man who died on a toilet pushing a hefty one, more kudos and still more folks loved the fat Elvis who cheated, who ate beef by the carloads and who was a walking drug cabinet FAR surpassing WHY the Gorgeous and truly talented Ms. Houston was treated so inhumanely by a unappreciative and low class public who did not deserve to have enjoyed her beauty and talent as the international populous has and OUR side of the ocean out rules what the lesser others thought of her.

This WILL be a collectors' item in years to come based on the overall entertainment value and the apparent hard work devoted to this version. It goes to PROVE that every bloody little girl IS a CInderella and there was never one ""type"" to begin with any way.

A great cast who seemed to have worked well together and well worth the purchase as reflected from the other truthful commentary featured here.",1413504000,,1731,4.637254901960785

Initially, yes, it's a little weird seeing a white man and a black woman have an Asian son (who marries a black woman). But growing up, no one I know mentioned anything about this and my daughter hasn't batted an eye at it either. I think it's more adults who see this while the kids just enjoy the story. Heck, if it bothers you that much just think of it as the king and queen adopted.

different races through out the movie. I didn't have a problem with that because it was all still the same to me as a kid. The story line was still the same, it had some extra funny parts in the movie for its modern day and time when the movie was filmed, so it was an overall great movie.

1381955,5,B00004Z4SE,"I watched this movie the day it aired for the first time on ABC. Instant love! AND I was in high school. I immediately fell in love with Paolo Montalban and his voice. I still look everywhere for updates on where he might be working (understudy on Broadway at the moment). The fact that it was a colorblind cast was what first drew me in. I do not understand why people are so ""affected"" by that. It doesn't matter!! It tells more of the people that are concerned over it than it does of the movie. Focus on the music and the story which is timeless in my opinion. I actually like this version better that the Disney cartoon one (GASP! that coming from me is close to blasphemy).

This prince is determined to not be manipulated by his parents. He wants to be in love with the girl he marries. He escapes the palace to roam the kingdom incognito. He has his own set of ideas, and fights for what he wants. He wants to be in love with the girl he marries. Tie that in with the already known story of Cinderella and BAM! Magic! I own it on DVD and have the soundtrack and yes, I still listen to it. Paolo has a beautiful voice, everyone is great in this movie. It's funny, it's musical theater adapted for television. One must appreciate it for what it is. My favorite song is ""The Sweetest Sound"" but I can sing along to all the songs because I have all the music memorized. No shame.
I have taken it upon myself to make sure that newer generations see this (as well as other lost treasures). Nieces and nephews, friends' kids.... it's a better alternative to some of the crap offered to the youth these days (I won't get specific)... and it gets the idea of ""melting pot"" to the innocent minds so that they do not grow up to critique a movie negatively only because it has a color blind cast. By the way, on the stage, this is common. Please see Broadway's ""The Little Mermaid"". Yes folks, King Triton was Black, played by the amazing Norm Lewis (also Javert from the Les Miserables 25th Anniversary Concert).

In a nutshell. Buy it, Watch it, Love it and share it. It's wholesome, innocent entertainment. Which is very lost in this day and age....
****The DVD has a behind the scenes ""Making of"" that is very enjoyable. The cast and crew put their hearts into this production. Shame to those who can't appreciate their hard work.",1394582400,,2330,4.3663594470046085

1381984,5,B00004Z4SE,Cinderella has been my favorite movie since way back when it was a black and white.  I love this remake - it is a funnier version.. but the songs are still the same with a beautiful song by Whitney Houston at the end.,1391731200,,217,4.046511627906977
1381985,3,B00004Z4SE,"I rather liked this film version of Rodger's and Hammerstein's musical, but I must also agree with some of the more negative reviews: this film is at times just ""too much"". Too many stars, too many settings, costumes, effects. There is no subtletly suggesting a fairy-tale-like, magical story: watching it you almost get the impression ""Hey, this could happen to me!"" (Maybe this was the filmmakers' aim, who knows.)

What I really found annoying was the pseudo-psychological morals applied, in particular during the dialogues between Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother. While the original fairy tale has female virtue for its topic (a girl wanting a guy to search for her, to ensure that he really has serious intentions and that he doesn't mind her being just a poor girl), as well as the fact that the really important things in life are gifts, this film's bottom line seems to be ""follow your dreams"".
I don't want to suggest that this attitude is absolutely wrong, but it did get on my nerves how e.g. Fairy Godmother insisted that Cinderella was only standing in her own way not going to the ball: she had to be reminded that the girl had no way to get there. I mean, wasn't it obvious enough? What is this supposed to tell the viewers - just wish hard enough, and the laws of judgment and physics will just disappear for you, and there will be absolutely no consequences to bear, neither for you nor anyone else? This is going too far, it is unconvincing and illogical. All in all, a nice film, but I liked the 1965 version better.",1391731200,,1538,4.633699633699634

This Roger and Hammerstein production with a color blind cast is a particular jewel with the late Whitney Houston playing the Fairy Godmother and Brandy as Cinderella.  Everyone is pitch perfect and perfectly charming.  There are some great songs like ""Falling in Love"" sung by the marvelous Bernadette Peters playing the wicked step mother that I have not heard in other Roger and Hammerstein productions.  The duet ""Someone for Me"" is also left out of some productions.  The sets, costumes and style of this production add visual interest as well.

1382089,5,B00004Z4SE,"Watching this movie is one of my earliest memories (yes, I just dated myself, whoops), and it's just as amazing now as it was then. The music is fantastic, the sets are stunning, and don't get me started on the costuming because it's brilliant on so many levels, from the opening scene where Cinderella and the Prince are the only people not wearing satin or velvet (no, seriously give it a good hard look. All that shimmer on the general populace is fancy fabric), to the split tulle overskirts on the ladies on the ball that are totally invisible until the music picks up, to the daisy hat on the flower seller.
Bernadette Peters is as brilliant as she always is, and Brandy, while one of the weakest voices on the cast (as far as this particular genre goes, I'm not denying she's good at her usual sort of music, but Rodger's and Hammerstein's music isn't especially easy for people with buckets of theater voice training, which she doesn't have), still manages to pull off the sort of sweetness this part requires. Paolo Montalban is utterly charming as the Prince, and I'm sad he isn't in more film, and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show on several occasions.
Is it campy? Yes, but it's a movie take on a stage musical take on a Victorian England take on a German fairytale, and it carries itself off charmingly because, not in spite of, this.
If you haven't seen this yet, you've missed a gem, and you should stop reading these reviews and go watch it immediately.",1384992000,7,1468,4.5643939393939394

1382287,2,B00004Z4SE,"It's virtually impossible to ruin a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, but the 1997 production does just that.  The ridiculous, politically correct multi-racial casting, the awkwardly (and needlessly) added songs, the cartoonish, campy acting all contribute to the desecration of a classic.  If you want to see what the show was meant to look like, find the 1957 Julie Andrews version or, better yet, the 1965 Leslie Ann Warren production. The Brandy/Whitney Houston version contaminates the simplicity and charm of the earlier shows.  The Rodgers & Hammerstein production company should be more protective of its precious properties.

This was a desecration of the original ""Cinderella"" with Julie Andrews.  Why the producers chose such a bizarre smattering of ""racially mixed"" characters is beyond me.  Either they should've done an all black cast, or all white (or mostly white) cast -- instead we get this awkward pairing of a pasty-white British king and the queen Whoopie Goldberg, and somehow we're supposed to believe they got together and produced a son who looks 1/2 hispanic and 1/2 chinese?  Come again?  It just doesn't make sense!  They even had to change some of the lyrics in the songs to accomodate Brandy's ethnicity (the line that goes ""her neck was no whiter than a swan"" and the one about being a ""slave in Calcutta"" was cut too).  The acting I didn't see a huge problem with, but the new lyrics and dialog were just so stilted and awkward, it left the entire movie to fall flat, a completely failed effort.  This is what happens when you try to please everybody and FORCE onto the audience this bizarro ultra-PC, racially-mixed-to-the-extreme cast.

1382533,4,B00004Z4SE,"Each of the three TV productions of Rodgers & Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" has something to recommend it: The original has Julie Andrews' gorgeous singing and gentle charm, and a great supporting cast. The 1960s remake is a classic, romantic example of that decade's stage-like video musicals. This 1997 version has the slickest production values of the three and - by far - the best script and character development.

For example, it's the only version where I believed that Cinderella and the Prince had anything in common and could conceivably fall in love that quickly. And (spoiler alert:) I love that in this production, he recognizes her *before* putting the shoe on her foot. I always wondered why Cinderella would want to marry a guy who couldn't recognize her except by her shoe size. Here he clearly likes her in many ways. The Stepmother and other supporting roles also get more character development here than the previous 75-minute versions allowed.

Brandy is immensely likable in the title role. Paolo Montalbn looks, sounds and acts every bit the Prince. Whitney Houston makes a strong fairy godmother, and Bernadette Peters is fantastic as the bitter, scenery-chewing stepmother.

I like most of Rob Marshall's choreography. The waltzes are danced beautifully, and the staging of other numbers shows wit and grace. However, the elaborate dance break in the middle of Jason Alexander's song ""The Prince is Giving a Ball"" is interminable, derivative and adds nothing to the film.

In short, although the tone is different from the previous productions, this remake holds up well on its own terms.",1272067200,4,1610,5.133587786259542

Mr Montalban was also perfect. In fact, there wasn't a mis-step in casting anywhere. These are all Broadway heavyweights (with the exception of Brandy & Ms. Desselle) but everyone 'held their own'.

First, the classic music is absolutely addictive. It's beautiful, fun, and performed so incredibly by the stars. The performances tug at your heart and pull you in. The choreography also adds to the joy of this film. The costumes are pure Disney magical, with wonderful color combinations, fabrics and designs.

Their minds weren't conditioned to think of people as so different that they couldn't be members of the same family, paired up as nuptials, or coupled as dancing partners of different races.  The only negative things they comment on are the self centeredness and selfish competitiveness of the characters in the film. This Cinderella story is just like any other great story to them.  They have watched this movie so much that the adults in my family got used to unusal and unexpected aspects of this movie.

Besides, if Disney made an all black Cinderella, chances are no one would have seen or bought it (have you noticed that they've never made an animated fairy/hero tale centered around black people? Lion King doesn't count - those were lions not people). Anyway, this was a fun movie.  Brandy was a wonderfully, beautiful Cinderella.  Her prince was handsome.  Her stepmother was appropriately evil and her stepsisters sufficiently obnoxious.  Whoopie was the Whoopie I love and after seeing this movie I still can't stand Jason Alexander.  For me there were only two weak links in this movie.  The worst character was Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother.  I just wanted to rip her cape or whatever off of her because her twirling around with it was so annoying.  And she came off as just too full of herself to really be caring about Cinderella.  The second weakness was the Broadway type song they added for Bernadette Peters to sing.  It was a totally different style of song and didn't fit with the other songs in the movie.  It seemed as though it was only put in the film to showcase Bernadette's Broadway singing style.",1201910400,,1501,4.745173745173745
1382648,5,B00004Z4SE,"As a young 10 year old black girl growing up I didn't see many people who looked like me garnering Hollywood roles. I had never before seen a fairy tale princess who was even black for that matter.  They all were blonde haired and blue eyed or a red head with green eyes or brunette with brown eyes, but never a beuatiful black princess with braids or anybody that closely resembled me. I can't say that Brandy closely resembles me(except the beautiful ebony skin), but when I saw this movie ten years ago it gave me hope.  I finally saw that it was okay for me to believe in being a princess and to dream about it. If you don't like this movie then I'm sorry. If you don't like Brandy's acting or singing then I'm sorry. If you don't like some of the main characters then I'm sorry. I'm sorry for you! This production was the first of its kind. It had a multiracial cast! What other movie has utilized multiracial casting in movies like this? Before this movie and after? None. Zip. Nada. Not a one, not a one. Don't get me wrong I don't simply love this movie because the lead character is black( I love many movies where the lead characters are most emphatically not black), however, to a young black girl growing up in a place where dreams are few and far between this movie revitalized my love of fairy tales. Fairy tales I once thought were only for a select group of people.

I love the fact that all the characters came from different ethnic backrounds, which made it the movie interesting.

1382652,5,B00004Z4SE,"My first comment to someone was that this later version, with Brandy as Cinderella, is ""more colourful."" No pun intended; the multiracial cast does add flair, a lot of flair. But somehow this version is just more interesting all around. The characters are more rounded out (take Paolo Montalban as the Prince, for example,) seeming less like two-dimensional stock fairytale characters, more like real personalities. There are more little details, more things going on, such as the marketplace puppet show and the stepsisters shopping for (and quarreling over) clothes in the first scene.

As a child I'd loved the 1964 televison broadcast, which everyone got to view about once a year. After seeing this one, however, I felt the 1964 show was a bit tame by comparison...I didn't notice that Brandi ""couldn't act."" To me, it seemed she was just playing a quieter, stronger, more serious, perhaps even a bit more cynical Cinderella (could it be that she learned to be more reserved in order to protect herself emotionally, after all those years of scolding?) than Lesley Ann Warren's timid, wide-eyed and very-easily-hurt character (I always identified with the stepsister who notes ominously, ""And with very little trouble, I could break her little arm..."") Though I've now come to appreciate the special qualities of each of these productions, I would still have to say the second one is my favourite, and my children's favourite as well.",1189987200,,1438,5.093220338983051
1382653,3,B00004Z4SE,"I first saw this production back when it premiered on television. I was about nine years old. I will admit that at the time I did notice that the cast was very diverse, but I never questioned it. I really was not confused. I figured that it was meant to be that way. For me, one of the things that I like, IS the diverse cast. That is probably the only reason that I even liked the film at all.

That said, the colors in this film are way too odd. I understand that it is a fairytale, but they do not need every bright color in the world. Also, they borrowed songs from other musicals. It was not necessary, the show is good without them.

Brandy was probably one of the worst choices that they could have made for Cinderella; especially since Cinderella has to SING. Brandy also cannot act in this. She is so awkward and fake. It is like she is at her first acting class. Whitney Houston was decent, but her singing, of course, was better than her acting. Luckily, she didn't have to act that much. Montalban was fantastic! Then again, he can actually act and sing. Whoopi was funny, but she kind of became annoying by the end of the film. It wasn't her acting, it was just her lines. Bernadette Peters is a good actress, I just didn't like her in this very much.",1184544000,2,1264,4.240663900414938
1382654,5,B00004Z4SE,"Brandy's Cinderella is a miracle, her voice perfection, her acting genuine and touchingly honest.  This 1997 version of ""Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella"" is a masterpiece, a starburst of colorful sets, exquisite costumes,and tantalizing terpsichore.
  The music takes center stage.  It is sweet, soulful and undeniably beautiful. The first view of the Prince's Ball with the the dancers dressed in flowing, shades of blue, the orchestra blooming into a glorious waltz melody is rapturous, the overhead camera capturing the magic of the couples dancing, whirling in symmetry. This is television magic at its best.
  The true beauty of this production, beyond it's acting and music, is that it gives voice to multi-racial America.  Why can't a black girl be Cinderella?  After all, the story of Cinderella originated in China.  If the movie were all black or all Asian, then it could be pushed aside and said it's only for black people or Asian people.  But the movie is inclusive, showing that fairy tales are not the exclusive domain of white people.  Now little black, Asian, white, brown children know they too can be princes and princesses.
  If that doesn't sound very important, imagine watching television during your childhood and never seeing anyone who looks like you.  You loved Oz, but the wizard, Dorothy and even the witch were white.(Ok, the witch was green, but that doesn't count). Your favorite martian was white, Samantha and Darrin were white.  You liked them all, but what does looking at a white world do to young, brown, black, or Asian minds?  It tells you that you are invisible, you don't count.
  Things have changed.  Everybody is on tv now.  But we still need images that reflect people of color in positive ways.  We too are America.  The producer of the production should be very proud.",1180828800,4,1820,4.996666666666667

1382678,3,B00004Z4SE,"I wanted to like this production, and back when it first aired I was looking forward to it with great anticipation.  But it was rather disappointing, overall; having now seen all three televised versions, I have to say that this is my least favourite of the lot.

Oh, it has its good points (the prince is very likeable, for instance) but the production is marred by poor casting.  I can't believe that a more charismatic actress (and better singer) couldn't be found for the title role.  In addition, there are several other primary cast members that I really don't care for (and whom, in a few instances, I actively dislike).  I know, that's a pretty subjective statement, but heck, I found both Whoopi Goldberg and Jason Alexander pretty darn annoying in their roles.

While this is certainly a more polished production than the earlier attempts, what on earth were they thinking with the set design?  I suppose a whimsical look was being attempted, to depict a fairy-tale type of world.  But honestly, the sets are so ugly in many cases as to be distracting to the eye.

But perhaps my main disappointment was with the orchestrations.  I didn't see any need whatsoever to give an updated pop sound to the instrumentals.  Rogers and Hammerstein musicals have a very distinctive, classic sound, and I found I missed it terribly; it was a big mistake, in my opinion, to change the music.

So... what did I like, you are probably wondering!  Well, it is still Rogers and Hammerstein---these are great songs, so it's worth watching for the tunes, despite the lousy orchestrations.",1176076800,2,1579,4.803703703703704

1382683,4,B00004Z4SE,"In 1997, forty years after Julie Andrews performed the title role LIVE in Rodgers and Hammerstein's TV production of Cinderella, R&B singer Brandy brought the role to life in TV's third incarnation of this musical classic, produced by The Wonderful World of Disney and Whitney Houston, who played the fairy godmother. Ratings were huge for the program, and it even won an Emmy.

This new production is different from the previous two in several ways. For one, this one is a made-for-TV movie, whereas the previous two were shot as if they were televising a play. This new version also has three new songs - The Sweetest Sounds, written by Richard Rodgers, The Music's In You, and Falling In Love With Love, written by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Updated special effects, more modern vernacular, a more empowered Cinderella, and a color-blind casting approach lend a freshness to the classic fairy tale. And I'm not too thrilled with all the complaints about the mixed cast. I, for one, am thrilled that little girls and little boys can watch this and see themselves represented, no matter what race they are. It's nice that for once, a little African American girl can see herself as the object of desire. And yes, the black queen and white king have an Asian son. Families like that are not uncommon today. Funny that people don't have a problem with a pumpkin becoming a carriage or mice becoming horses, but they have a problem with this.

A few flaws exist in the film. The CGI effects are sometimes a little TOO obvious, such as in the pumpkin transformation sequence. And although Brandy is sweet and lovely as Cinderella, she's no Julie Andrews. These flaws do not detract from the general charm of this production, and don't put me off at all. I love Brandy's performance, and her more modern feminist approach to the character of Cinderella.

However, Disney needs to release a new DVD version. This DVD is one of the first Disney DVDs ever - in fact, this DVD predates the ""Disney DVD"" brand and logo. The bonus features include a home video release trailer and ""A Cinderella Story"" featurette. I think it's time to update this DVD release. The transfer is very good, but could possibly use a bit of remastering. Maybe some retrospective bonus materials. And, since an official soundtrack was never released, a music-only track would also be a nice idea. Maybe some audio commentary from the actors and producers and such.

Despite all the flaws of this DVD treatment and the flaws of the production itself, it's definitely a DVD I was thrilled to find for $10 at a local drug store, because I've loved this production ever since it first aired in November of 1997 on ABC. It's definitely worth buying.",1165795200,4,2717,4.762208067940552
1382684,4,B00004Z4SE,"After growing up with the Leslie Ann Warren version and adoring it as a child (and singing the wrong words to all the songs all year long until I learned some more the next year it appeared on TV), I was hoping for a magical remake. I was a little dissappointed in how over-produced this version was - especially the dance number when Jason Alexander is telling the town about the ball. I LOVED Bernadette Peters - especially the song ""Falling in Love with Love"" which gives some interesting backstory on her character. Whitney Houston was definitely overdoing it... someone should have reminded her that this was CINDERELLA'S story.

The Prince was terrific and his parents - well, they were a hoot! Brandy LOOKS pretty and sings well, but didn't really come off as all that sweet or real.

Many of the costumes - while gorgeous and extremely elaborate - were not terribly flattering, especially for Whoopi and Whitney which was a distraction. Personally, I'll take Leslie Ann Warren's simple and flowing fur trimmed ball gown over the sparkly Brandy version any day.

The racial diversity didn't bother me at all. The people making a big deal about that have their own issues that do not belong in a fairy-tale movie review.

Many of the scenes were just a little too long, a few were MUCH too long. It would have been a better movie if they had tightened it up a bit.",1165795200,2,1370,4.625514403292181

I wanted to add my two cents, here.  I saw this movie when it first came on tv in the mid 90's.  I don't remember it that well, but remember being stunned and horrified of such a multi-cultural cast.  I agree with the reviewer who pointed out how odd it was and awkward it would have been to try to explain to your kids why the king is asian and his parents are both different races.  I hadn't thought about that.  And Brandy as Cinderella??  Please.  I did like some of  Whitney's singing, but competely disagreed with all the different races in the movie.. and a BLACK step-sister??  Geez. And no, i am not racist.

First, there are millions of families out there that ARE like this!  There are tons of families where the father could be white, the mother could be black, and they could have adopted an asian kid.  Families these days are not standard, you can find every type of families.  So it would be the perfect opportunity to explain that reality to your children and tell them that yeah people of different races can fall in love and that people sometimes adopt children.

Also, this movie has such a positive message because its goal is to show that different races can live together and that we shouldn't even look at races because we are all humans and equal.  For some people who are complaining and can't watch this movie because of the color, you have to look inside yourselves and ask yourselves why?  I personally watch it and I love it, I don't even notice the different races, I see them all as humans.

Also, another way of explaining this would be that this is a fairy tale, a fantasy.  In the movie, there is magic, flying, tons of unrealistic things.  Anything can happen in a fantasy movie including families from different races.  So there are two different ways of explain it:  1. It's a fantasy anything can happen in it, 2. Adoption.

Whitney Houston was behind this project as a producer and she should be applauded for this new refreshing take on this classic.

1382735,5,B00004Z4SE,"I got this DVD in the bargain rack at the local drugstore for my almost 3 year old daughter.  She loved the music and costumes, and I loved it becaues I had grown up with the 1960s version and still remember the words to all of the songs.  Whitney Houston does  a wonderful job as the Fairy Godmother, and Brandy brings a sweetness to Cinderella.  Her acting is just fine, I enjoyed her singing more than Lesley Ann Warren.  (I always found Leslie her a little saccharine and cloying.)  This version includes a new gem when it adds an old Rogers and Hammerstein song (The Sweetest Sounds) as a duet done by Cinderella and the Prince.  Their version of that song was so lovely to me that I wanted to see if it was available on a soundtrack.  Unfortunately, it looks like Disney never released it, and that's a shame.  I was actually kind of suprised at the harsh tone of some of the other reviews.  Brandy is not Julie Andrews, but then again, Julie Andrews was no Jeanette McDonald.  I'm sure if some of the previous reviewers were around back in the 1940s, they'd probably have complained the Frank Sinatra was no Enrico Caruso too.  I loved the fact that this was a multi-ethnic cast, and I believe they did bring the magic of the original score to a new generation.  The stepsisters were goofy and fun, and Bernadette Peters makes a great wicked stepmother.  This production is lovely in its own right.  I think this version is much grander, and I wish the soundtrack was available.  I definitely will buy the soundtrack from the 1957 production to enjoy Julie Andrew's versions of the song, but meanwhile, my little girl has already learned to sing ""Impossible...things are happening every day!"".",1113177600,2,1700,4.598006644518272
1382756,4,B00004Z4SE,"To be completley honest, the Rodger's and Hammerstein version of Cinderella never really interested me, I saw the second incarnation when I was about 6, maybe it was my 6 year old mind, but the sets and actors never really interested me, Cinderella was bland, boring, and the songs just never caught on to me. But about a year or two later (I think in 1987) the Disney version came out for the first time on VHS- and I was completely blown over, I was so excited to see it (and my love of Disney movies still remains to this day)- and the Rodger's and Hammerstein version was a pleasantly distant memory to me.

About a month or two before this version aired, I remember seeing something about it on entertainment tonight, and I was a little skeptical, but was completely in love when I saw it!  It was amazing! Now, the Whitney thing really didn't work for me (Hence the four stars- but I could be placing that on current Whitney events) I was most surprised by Brandy, her acting has never really been BAD- but it's never really been that good, but she made it work, and her voice was flawless, I wish she would sing like that more often! The rest of the cast was perfect, the costumes were amazing, the sets were unbelievable, and the songs were exceptionally outstanding- my personal favorite was the additon of ""the Sweetest Sounds""- it was so beautiful and really brought a little more emotional depth to Cinderella (I've never seen the Original Julie Andrews version, but the second version- Cinderella was a little whiny- but then again- I was only 6)

The contemporary twist, the new music, the actors, it was all amazing, although it still stands a distant second to the Disney telling, it's a beautiful telling, and one of my favorite DVD's in my collection.",1111881600,,1769,4.574132492113565
1382757,2,B00004Z4SE,"The Rodgers and Hammerstein musical has an excellent score, and when it was premiered in 1957, both Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show to promote their musical, explaining that it was a ""traditional retelling"" of the classic story of Cinderella. Fortunately for them, they did not live to see this production, for they would surely have died had they seen it. Somehow even the score was not left intact, as a song from No Strings invaded the score, and the result was something short of catastrophic.

While the performers in the cast are great singers, their acting ability leaves MUCH to be desired. Brandy, who plays Cinderella, is no actress. Whoopi Goldberg and Jason Alexander, while beloved to audiences for what they do well, hardly seemed right for this story. Whitney Houston may be a great singer, but the suggestion of her being Cinderella's fairy godmother just makes no sense at all. There are some funny sequences here and there, but the whole production comes across as bombastic and unconvincing. For all the money that went into making this fiasco, the audience deserved a lot more than it gets. The original 1957 version is by far the best, and the 1965 version, while not nearly as good as the original, still greatly outshines this turkey. Had the various performers just been gathered to sing the score on a recording, it would have been far better than to have made this rather garish attempt at a production that falls far short of its predecessors, because while the vocal talents are excellent, quite simply, they just can't act!",1108684800,8,1591,4.870848708487085

1382759,1,B00004Z4SE,"As a brown mom with a brown child and a FREAK for the '65 version, I REALLY wanted to like this version. However, I hate it.

I loved the sets for this production... Bernadette Peters, Whoopi, Victor Garber, Jason Alexander are all terrific. GREAT camera work on Ten Minute Ago - you feel like ~you~ are waltzing and dizzy with love too...

I, for one, LOVED the multiracial casting... for the techies out there, let's assume, the prince was adopted - okay? I LIKED that my child would see a multiracial world where ~she~ could indeed be the princess who gets the prince (instead of it always going to the blonde or white girl).

The singing is bad. Brandy ruined In My Own Little Corner. Whitney overacts and distracts. Sigh.

I have soundtrack to the original '57 version which I play a lot for my little girl (who loves it).",1103500800,15,827,4.493333333333333
1382760,2,B00004Z4SE,"I am seeing this again -- right now -- for the first time in a while.  Atrocious acting.  Some good singing but otherwise, horrors, what have they tried to DO to this show?  I'm not talking about the multiracial casting, but the sheer lack of chemistry, or joy, or whatever  it is making this seem forced and fake.

And whoever thought the Leslie Ann Miller version was atrocious, let me just say as a 60s teenage girl that the words ""Impossible Things Are Happening Every Day"" were taped across the top of my bedroom mirror for years.  Thank you.",1103414400,4,547,4.474747474747475
1382761,5,B00004Z4SE,"As a young black girl, most if not all the images I saw on televison and movies  of princesses were all white. While the shows were certainly entertaining, they gave me--and I'm sure, many other Americans--the sense that little black girls didn't really have a place in fairytales.  I can't tell you what it means to me (and other  ethnic groups) to see a major Hollywood production using multi-ethnic performers.  And as a mother of  Scottish-Jewish-African children, it's wonderful to see a musical in which color-blind casting is used. That, combined with pretty decent--I'd say stellar--production values and updated sets, costumes and performances, makes for a show that will certainly appeal to new generations--a wonderful example of diversity for everyone.  Who knows--perhaps the kids of today will feel as strongly about this version as the adults do about the Julie Andrews production from decades ago.",1102723200,92,913,5.2620689655172415
1382762,1,B00004Z4SE,"You are all idiots, except for the editorial review.  I am not going to waste more than a few sentences to say that the ONLY worthy version of this classic is the orignal 1957 version that is now available on DVD.  Brandy has no business being anywhere near a stage/camera or anything that has to do with entertainment.  The whole production is a disgrace and an insult to Rodgers and Hammerstein.  This drek makes the movie version of ""Annie"" look like ""Casablanca.""  The only reason I am giving it one star is the computer won't take anything less.",1102636800,9,550,4.571428571428571

Brandy is sweet, but I like it more for Whoppi, Bernadette, Whitney and Victor Garber. Jason Alexander was annoying though and unapealing as the valet/butler.

Ricardo Montalban's son was also very sweet. Not a bad version like I said but Julie's is still the best one.",1102377600,,398,4.513888888888889

It's all glossed up and doesn't have the warmth and innocense of the older version. This is supposed to be a play, and this one doesn't make the movie theme work. The new songs are not at all good, too. I feel so sorry for my peers who have only seen this version! They have truly missed out in the wholesome 1965 Cinderella with the elegant Lesley Ann Warren. In general, the Rodgers and Hammerstein Cinderella is absolutely wonderful. I'm 15 and I still watch and know all the lyrics!",1075248000,9,601,4.327433628318584

1382793,4,B00004Z4SE,"Ok, whose idea was it to cast Brandy as Cinderella? It would not surprise me if she had no musical-theater experience at all. She could not handle the magnificent Rodgers and Hammerstein II songs. However, that one poor decision by the casting director cannot steal the enchantment from this wonderful remake.
Many of the best songs from the legendary team of Rodgers and Hammerstein II appear in this musical. The songs are all enchanting and engrossing, sure to get the attention of all. A great job was done on improving the libretto, the one thing that always flawed this show, despite its wonderful score.
Most of the performances are great, excluding a few. I've probably made it clear that Brandy did not do a great job as the title character. She seems overly stiff and, though a proven singer, cannot handle the glorious R&H songs. One of the best songs from this show ""In My Own Little Corner"" is still entertaining, but not nearly as much as it should have been. It surprised me when Whitney Houston popped up as the fairy godmother. When I first realized that she was playing the part, I got sort of frustrated. However, she actually does an excellent job, making the character her own. She, of course, puts a lot of her own personality into the character, but it seems to work. Her intertpretaion of the character was new and fresh, and her rendetion of ""Impossible"" is super. I'm a fan of Jason Alexander and he does a good job portraying the prince's steward. His theater experience shows in his performance. I must ask though- why the accent? He did not need it at all and it was very distracting! Whoopi Goldberg and Victor Garber are exceptional as the King and Queen, despite their limited screen time. It was nice to have these two veterans show up. The two stepsisters are hysterical. Their rendetion of ""Step-sister's Lament"" was priceless, it had me howling!
However, the performer who steal the show is the great Broadway veteran Bernadette Peters. Her performance and interpretation of the wicked step-mother was fresh and original. She could have easily just made her a typical villan, but gives humane qualities. She is absolutely fabulous, a Broadway legend. I loved her solo ""Falling in Love with Love""! A great added Rodgers and Hart song from ""The Boys from Syracuse""! It amazed how that song so easily flowed into the score. (The remake also added the Rodgers and, well, Rodgers song ""The Sweetest Sounds"" as the opening number, to great effect I might add!)
The sets and costumes seem a little bit much, but they contribute to the enchanting qualities of this remake. It is a great film that your family will love and fall in love with. A great film! Despite the one poor casting decision! Hope you enjoy it.
*******If your family bought and enjoyed this, you might also enjoy the ABC productions of ""Annie"" and ""The Music Man"". Also check out the classic musical ""Fiddler on the Roof""!",1070755200,2,2919,4.748031496062992

I 've been desapointed by the queen (Whoopy) and her husband. The prince too. But Brandy's step mother and her daughters were amazing. I love them.
But the real sunshine is Whitney Houston! She's incredible.
Beautiful as ever, she acts very well, sing perfectly ""Impossible"" and ""There's music in you"". She introduce and conclude the movie with magic! I love that. And she bring so much to the movie. I'm waking up each time whe she appears to Brandy at the first time. Wouaw.....
