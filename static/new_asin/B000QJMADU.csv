8196660,3,B000QJMADU,"I have been looking for information and instructions for different Cavendoli techniques and have not found anything at all except this video, so I bought it. If you are a beginner this video will be informative, but if you want to know about more advanced Cavendoli techniques then you will be very disappointed, as I was. Ms. Babcock just doesn't deliver anything beyond the half hitch, how one combines vertical and horizontal knots for geometric designs, and how one adds cords into a work. These are all good things to know, but I was hoping to find out something, anything about free-form techniques. There is nothing approaching this on the video. Also, the  production values in both the video and book are quite low considering the high price. Paying $27 for a video that has the constant sound of the camera fan whirring in the background feels like a bit of a rip-off. And worse, the video most definately DOES NOT run 66 minutes as advertised -- or at least it doesn't seem like it. I thought I would get much, much more information than I did thinking this was a one-hour video. A lot of this time is wasted talking about the types of cords and beads that are used in macrame, which I would think the person searching for information on Cavendoli would already know quite well. Finally, I contacted Ms. Babcock by email (which she provides) to ask a question about how a certain Cavendoli technique, which was not included in the video or book, was accomplished. In my email I told her that I had purchased her products. She did write back, but she said she ""does not have any information for me at this time"" and suggested I should be willing to pay for this information. Not even a thank-you for buying the video and book. I realize we all need to put bread on the table, but the crafting community I love is one where information is shared freely. I didn't get what I was looking for with this video, but it's currently the ONLY thing out there that I can find regarding Cavendoli knotting. Ms. Babcock needs some competition.",1324771200,3,2041,4.576502732240437
8196661,5,B000QJMADU,I have not done macrame in years and have had a renewed interest in it especially the micro macrame. This is the best book to purchase for that. Clear diagrams and instructions....overall very well done. I would highly recommend this to everyone to buy. I also purchased the companion video which is great also. Buy this and you will not be sorry....if you don't you are missing a great publication.,1244937600,5,399,4.714285714285714
