8052403,5,B0007VY5LM,"This video serries is a must for any student of martial arts.  It is a very technical and a 100% accurate training video made by a master martial artist. This is the form I studied for several years and I can atest to the accuracy of the forms it depicts. There is no holywood board breaking or wana-be ninja stunts in this video serries...  It is all solid feet on the floor mind intensive training.  For those who do not know it, this is the form of Karate chosen by the USMC many years ago (when I was in) and is considered by those who actualy fight to survive, as the best (not Brazillian judo, or tangsudo or jeet kun do). for one on one submission/grapling there are better forms; but to be a police officer or foot soldier I have never seen better. It's roots are legendary, and the video serries covers some of the history as well as the forms.  I've looked for schools to teach it where I live now, but they only have Mc-Karate and Mc-taekwando.  Don't waste your money on those schools.  You will learn more in 1 hour from this video than you will get in a year of karate at the local clown karate school. I know because I paid $1,100 to prove it!",1256947200,,1158,4.217194570135747
8052404,5,B0007VY5LM,"I agree completely that Higaonna's ""Kata"" video is a good choice for the absolute beginner, particularly kids. However,  if you've been training for three months or more and are serious about learning karate, you need to at least start thinking about buying ""master class"" level videos like this.
The production quality of all the videos in this series is superb, it goes without saying that with an instructor of this caliber the karate is unbelievable, and the multi camera studio footage and excellent slow motion shows everything. As any experienced karate man will tell you, if you don't understand by watching, an explanation is not going to help you.
This American produced video is part of a series (Goju Ryu Technical Series) that is a best seller in Japan where it is distributed by the media department of the Japan Karate Federation. Enough said!",1026777600,,858,4.958333333333333
8052405,1,B0007VY5LM,"I purchased this video expecting full, detailed descriptions of the addressed kata, including the history of each of the kata and subtleties of its performance.  I was sadly disappointed. The video does provide a presentation of the indicated kata from different camera angles and in slow motion.  However, there is virtually no narration and bunkai demonstrations are very limited. My recommendation: don't waste your money on this video (I don't know about the other videos in the series), rather, buy Higaonna's ""Kata"" video as it shows all the Goju-Ryu kata and related bunkai - it is one of my favorites!",1013644800,3,609,5.08
