7796554,5,1565859537,"I found this series of lectures mesmerizing because of the books relevance to todays world. From this course, I learned about the earlier years of our country, the nature of democracy, and the personal involvement that is needed to maintain a democratic society.

As Professor Cook said, this is claimed to be the best book on America and democracy. Alexis de Tocqueville, a twenty-five year old from France, came to America in 1831 to study the prison system.  But he was enthralled with the government and culture, and wrote this book to encourage democracy in France.

Below, I summarized a few of Tocquevilles concepts that I found particularly interesting.  The page numbers come from the booklets that accompanied the discs.

Equality of conditions is the most fundamental element of democracy. (Part 1, p 16)
It is equality, not freedom, that is Americas prime desire. (Part 1, p 17)
As in my review of the Great Courses lectures on the U. S. Constitution, this reminds me of Stephen Coveys Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. The quality of relationships that bind people, rather than independence, may be the sign of a more developed and functioning democracy. At the least, independence (e.g., liberty, freedom) and interdependence (e.g., justice, fairness) need to be balanced.

The worlds movement toward equality of conditions is a providential fact. (Part 1, p 16)
As I learned from the Great Courses lectures on Natural Law and Human Nature, the desire for equality may be an innate characteristic in most people, and a source of morality and law.

The most important reason for Americas success with democracy is its mores. (Part 2, p 16)
Tocqueville states that women make mores in a society. (Part 2, p 32)
Of all the reasons for the success of America, the most important is the superiority of its women. (Part 2, p 33)
American women spread democracy through practice in American culture and the home.
As I mentioned in another review, author Donald T. Phillips (The Founding Fathers on Leadership, Lincoln on Leadership, Martin Luther King, Jr., on Leadership) wrote that many past leaders experienced strong bonds with their mothers. Perhaps their mothers were the sources of moral training. In any case, we should balance the ways of men with the ways of women.

Abridged versions of Tocquevilles Democracy in America often completely excluded the longest chapter, that of Blacks and Indians. But slavery and the treatment of Native Americans elicited some of Tocquevilles harshest criticisms of America. (The underlying theme of Phillips leadership trilogy was slavery.)

Interestingly, according to Tocqueville, democracy and equality carry the potential for their own destruction.

Individualism is a new human phenomenon, and in fact, Tocqueville invents the word in Democracy in America . . . In an egalitarian society, there is no privilege. It is common for people to withdraw into a circle of family and friends where they can be treated in a special way. In doing so they abandon public life and public concerns . . . Individualism dries up the source of public virtues. (Part 2, p 26)
Individualism leads people away from being active in public affairs, thus leaving matters for the states involvement. (Part 2, p 27)

In a democracy where there is equality of conditions, there is a longing in people to achieve material well-being . . . People begin to regard political obligations as onerous, because they keep them from their individual pursuits. (Part 2, p 28)
In a democracy where there is equality of conditions, people are, in general, discontented with what they possess . . . This leads them to commerce and industry, because these are the quickest and best ways of improving their fortunes . . . The development of industry could lead to the creation of an aristocracy in America. (Part 2, p 29)

Electoral competition exacerbates the tendency to withdraw.  (Part 2, p 27)
Tocqueville witnessed and heard of very nasty and fierce political campaigns in America.  He felt that this would discourage many people from running for political office.

But there are counterbalances that encourage people to be active in politics.

For Tocqueville, the anchor of democracy is in religion generally and Christianity specifically. (Part 2, p 19)
Christianity is, in its essence, supportive of democracy and its most essential principle, equality of conditions. (Part 2, p 19)
Religion works against isolation and the desire for immediate fulfillment. (Part 2, p 30)

Civic associations prepare citizens to become part of political associations . . . Civic associations are an antidote to the tendency of people to withdraw from the public sphere in a democracy. (Part 2, p 10)

Participation in political associations is practicing what Tocqueville calls self-interest well understood. People recognize that in serving others, they are also serving themselves. (Part 2, p 7)

The jury serves as an important school for democracy . . . The tendency of people to try to avoid jury duty damages democracy. (Part 1, p 29)

The township is the purest institution of democracy . . . Local government becomes a training ground for people who hold higher office. (Part 1, p 31)
""The key to fighting individualism is for communities to have vibrant local governments that can act independently. (Part 2, p 27)

When Tocqueville came to America, he was not convinced of the wisdom of the freedom of the press that existed here. (Part 1, p 37)
Tocqueville realized that free associations (political and civil) are vital to democracy, especially in preventing the tyranny of the majority . . . As greater equality and the resulting individualism lead people to withdraw from public life, newspapers become even more important . . . Without newspapers, there is little chance for common action. (Part 1, p 38)
Today, newspapers, social media, the internet, smart phones, blogs and reviews such as this connect people through the sharing of information.

Alexis de Tocquevilles Democracy in America was a great and important book in 1840, when it was published in full. It is still a great and, perhaps, a more important book as America and the world continue to move toward equality of conditions in the 21st century. (Part 2, p 40)

Based on Professor Cooks lectures, my life experiences, and current events, I agree.

Thank you.",1460246400,,6357,5.049665711556829
7796555,2,1565859537,I would not  recommend this lecture. I watched it and kept waiting for the reasons why Tocqeville is important. Examples were rather specific local politics and  I would have liked the reasons why this man is considered such a major figure. My advise is to stick to Professor Cook's wonderful lectures on Dante and Machiavelli.,1403913600,,327,4.927272727272728
