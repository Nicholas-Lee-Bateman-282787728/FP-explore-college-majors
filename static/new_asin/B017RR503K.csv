7515085,4,B017RR503K,"Admittedly ignorant on the topic, I found the film interesting as a historical piece. Being amateur boxers allowed them to ""one punch"" anyone who got in the way. Their idea was to strike first and strike hard. Of the twins Ronnie(Simon Cotton) was menatlly unstable and was difficult to keep in check by his brother Reggie (Kevin Leslie). They controlled the East end and expanded into the West side once gambling became legal. The film showed their violence, gang wars and influence over politicians. I am eager to see the next installment.

The acting was a bit stiff for most of the characters who were sane, but the film was still enjoyable.

The Krays inevietably make it to the top of any presentation covering the London underground and organized crime in the 50-60 and 70's. This documentary did the finest job of making that presentation,.",1462406400,,292,5.511111111111111

7515229,5,B017RR503K,I have read about these gangster brothers who were the leaders of the London gangs and how they rose to that rather scary place. Twin brothers who loved to fight and one brother was institutionalized for a time because of his violent streak and the rampages theses boyw would go on to secure their place in the London Underworld. This is an amazing story and very well told and also very well acted. Simon Cotton and Kevin leslie are superb. The rest of the cast of their gang are also right on target. Very violent and bloody as befits theses guys. Not for the faint of heart.,1457654400,2,577,4.401869158878505

8740318,5,B017RR503K,"This is the movie Tom Hardy should have been in.  The British cast is totally unknown to me. Simon Cotton who plays Ronnie is too thin and doesn't resemble Ron at all. That said, his performance is perfection. Kevin Leslie who plays his twin Reggie looks a little like Reg but doesn't have the acting chops Cotton has. How strange that so many years after their deaths the Kray twins are hot again!

The music is authentic to London in the 50s and 60s. Would have loved to hear some of the big name groups though. The interiors and exteriors of the clubs and homes are spot on.  That is how I measure a film. How 'Disneyland' did they make it? Legend, sadly, was awash in pretty pastels, soft, flattering lighting and lots of close ups of the main stars. In the end, Ron/Reggie (both played by Tom Hardy) seemed criminal cut-outs or paper tigers.

You get to see first hand why the law enforcement agencies in London could not stand the twins and how they were walking free from serving jail time for their crimes. You understand when they reach the point of no return and go after the Krays with a vengeance.  You understand why the brothers never got out of prison after their last incarceration in early 1969. It must have been humiliating to the cops to have their hands tied for so many years when it came to justice for the victims of the Kray twins.

The acting from everyone involved is excellent.  I think when you are making a film about real people and the times they lived in, it is best to cast unknowns in the main roles. They give far more credence to the scenes.  This film is really well written and well acted.  Events that were eliminated from Legend are in this one. Reg's marriage is not mentioned and the actress playing his girlfriend, Frances, looks nothing like her.  There is a lot of bloody violence and is difficult to watch. It is a gritty film about London in the bad old days. It helps if you know a great deal about Reg and Ron before watching the film. You see the flaws and appreciate certain events that, perhaps, were not covered in previous Kray movies.

I first learned about them the week I arrived in London in 1969. They had just been put in prison weeks before I arrived and the newspapers were full of stories about them. Over the years I have bought every book written by them and about them, and watched every major film.

SPOILER ALERT: This is a film about the RISE of the Kray twins. It ends before they really get into trouble with the authorities and go to prison.  So, if you're expecting to see the downfall it isn't in this one.  Perhaps they will make another one entitled, The Fall Of The Krays. That would be worth viewing I'm sure. I highly recommend it to anyone who saw Legend and was disappointed.  This one won't disappoint, I promise you.",1482278400,,2800,4.409708737864078
