8455132,5,B0053CAX84,"I have to admit that I haven't been able to watch this as it is a Region 2 dvd, but I knew that when I bought it.  I really purchased it for the jacket picture of Joel McCrea.  Pix of him are hard to come by.  If I get a dvd player that handles Region 2 I'll definitely watch it.  However, the picture is worth it!  It was delivered quickly and in fine packaging.",1348012800,,363,3.8513513513513513
