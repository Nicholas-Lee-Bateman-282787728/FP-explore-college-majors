6130939,5,B00H47IWES,"Lots of action here. The fight scenes are good and its not the same old type story line. If you like sword fights and big battle scenes this is movie for you. I haven't been so happy with a battle movie since Red Cliff which is another great film,",1398124800,,247,4.061224489795919
6130940,5,B00H47IWES,I was blown away by the choreography and the cinematography. Worth the purchase. I wish more martial arts films were as good as this one.,1397260800,,137,4.52
6130941,5,B00H47IWES,"it is not that often, that I find a show in my native language . story was great and the acting and effects were good.",1396137600,,118,3.76
6130942,3,B00H47IWES,"I have to admit even though I am Vietnamese I grew up watching tons of Chinese movies. As you can see from my past reviews and also my Listmania that I have watched a lot. I didn't really watch a whole lot of Vietnamese movies because 1) the acting and movies that I remember were over the top and 2) my parents soured me on any experience because every movie they had was not that great. I just remember trying to watch this one Vietnamese martial art film and was not impressed at all by the costumes, the fighting choreography or the acting. It was painful to finish that one and maybe it was unfair- but I never watched anything else from Vietnam for quite awhile. Comparing the 80s Vietnamese films to the 80s Chinese films and you have a huge difference. I would say that the Vietnamese films are about 10 years behind the Chinese ones even back then.
The only other films that I have seen were Cyclo and The Scent of Papaya.  Both weren't martial art films so I would have to say that I approached this with an open mind.
  I watched more out of curiosity since I have read other viewers compare this to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I would have to say that the only similarity to that movie was the wire choreography.  To be completely honest, this wasn't the worse movie I have ever watched. Actually, I would go as far as to say that this was as decent attempt for an martial arts film in Vietnam and probably one of the better films that they have come out with in regards to this genre.
  In a nutshell, we have the main character who is the grandson of a nobleman of the royal court. His grandfather was implicated and framed for the murder of the King and as a result, his family was wiped out, except for the main character Nguyen Vu, who managed to escape with the help of a servant I believe. He is left in the care of an old monk at a monastery who is a friend of his grandfather's. This monk raises him and teaches him martial arts. When Nguyen Vu grows up, he learns the story of his family and of the legend of the blood letter which was written by a close eunuch to the king that witnessed what really happened and wrote down incriminating information in blood before he dies. Nguyen Vu embarks on a mission  to recover the letter and to seek justice and expose the truth. Along the way, he encounters many and he has to rely on himself to distinguish between who he can trust and who he can't. There is the regular assortment of cast members that are present in most martial films. We have the idealistic main character, we have a strong willed love interest, we have several villains, and we have friends.  All in all, the plot line was a tad bit weak. This movie was based on a book by  Bui Anh Tan which I have not read but it seems to be a lot of what has already been made by the Chinese.
  The good: I was actually impressed by how this was filmed. I still think that the caliber of this film is several years behind the Chinese in terms of martial arts and effects, but it wasn't that bad. The scenery was beautiful as well as the colors and lighting. It did feel like a high budget movie and not a low budget one and you can tell there was a lot put into picking out the backgrounds to film against. I have never visited Vietnam having been born here in the U. S and I was awed by how beautiful the country is. I would definitely rate the filming of the countryside as being one of the top highlights of the movie. I was also impressed by the music. It went well with the film scenes and didn't distract but enhanced in a lot of the scenes.
  The Meh:  The story line and plot. Again, it seemed like this was done a lot already in other movies that I have seen. I wasn't too intrigued by the plot itself or the love interest between the characters. Actually, I kinda figured out the plot twists and turns and  felt that the movie took too long on delivering the main storyline. It started out with promise with having the main character go on this important life mission, fizzled out in intensity and then trickled down into an limp ending that left me going, huh? That's it? Very anti-climatic. The movie plot didn't really suck me in or even get me involved enough to care at the end to what happened. I actually felt that this movie borrowed heavily from the Chinese influence in movies. I even saw this one part in the movie that there was a wanted poster for one of the girls in the movie and it was written in Chinese. That threw me for a loop.  And of course, utilizing the wire choreography. Whereas in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon the wiring came off as graceful and beautiful. In this movie, it was slowed down so much that it look awkward at times. And they slow-moed a lot of the choreography so that it looked fake. I mean, people are flying around- it's fake anyway but it somehow looks less fake when  it's not slowed down so much. That was my only deal.  Otherwise, the choreography was a huge improvement on what I used to remember the movies looked like on a low budget. There was a lot of stylized killing- nothing too gory.
  I did like the actor that played the main character, he was pretty natural and did a good job. The girl was okay she was kind of one dimensional but she was not really the main focus of the movie so they did fine casting the bigger roles. The costumes were beautiful and simple and it was interesting to see different versions of the native dress in Vietnam.
  The Bad: some of the actors were very wooden. I'm not sure if they were supposed to be that poker faced or not, but it definitely came off as choppy and unemotional. Namely, the main villain. I honestly am not sure if his voice was dubbed to sound so dead, but his facial expression and acting wasn't helping him either.
  Overall it was a solid production from Saiga Movies and I was mildly surprised by how the movie was. It exceeded my expectations slightly in terms of entertainment. It is by no means, the next Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but still a decent movie overall. If you are a casual martial arts movie watcher, this  will look good to you- but to fellow fanatics...this movie will just be okay.",1395100800,,6156,4.299913569576491
6130943,5,B00H47IWES,"I am a fan of epic Asian martial arts cinema and this film delivers.  It is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Lots of big battles and great scenery.",1392422400,,193,4.333333333333333
6130944,2,B00H47IWES,This is for kids. I saw much better historical movies from that area.,1416355200,,69,4.384615384615385
6130945,1,B00H47IWES,"This is a silly movie. The cast is very uneven. The two principal female actresses are lovely, alluring young women who can't act; they alternately act sexy or pout, do they even know the difference? The villain unconvincingly overacts. He tries but fails to suggests menace and remarkable strength smoldering inside. And the hero is just a boy, callow, naive, no, make that stupid. He is supposed to be an expert swordsman, but he lives in poverty. Huh? You mean to say no warlord who depends on such warriors to prop up his power hasn't discover him, to exploit his killing talents? Unconvinvcing. There are so many Asian films which succeed as modest but genuine tales of these chaotic times. I think the director had a vision for his film but he could not succeed given the limited skills of his performers and a script that settled for the lowest common denominator of movie cliches. What a pity! I hope this director gets another chance with the resources he needs.",1414627200,,971,4.7176470588235295

6130948,5,B00H47IWES,"Enjoy watching a good movie where the hero doesn't take a life that has caused him/her pain and suffering. This one has many plots. I was glad I bought it, And it even has humor in it. The area where they shot this movie is breath taking. Be great to build a house around such a scene.",1407024000,,285,4.017543859649122

6130950,5,B00H47IWES,"This is the first entry of Vietnam into Wuxia cinema, and the movie had a large budget, which shows with the quality of the cinematography, the costumes, and sets. I am not usually impressed with characters in this sort of film, as they tend to be one-dimensional, but in this movie, there was character development, and the quality of acting as good to very good, with the primary hero, and villain being the best of acting, but the supporting characters doing a very good job as well.

There are several plot twists, making it different than many films of the genre. All in all, I would recommend the movie to anyone with an interest in some of the historical legends of Vietnam, and who wants to see something a little outside of the norm in the Chinese offerings.",1403740800,,767,4.557971014492754
6130951,5,B00H47IWES,"Sword of The Assassin was exceptional as an martial arts action, fantasy and the love story touch
matched with the backdrop of Viet Nam scenory... I compare it to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
type epic... It still perplexes me that people can watch American film fantasy like Batman, Thor,
or Spiderman and belittle martial art fantasy film.. Sword of The Assassin moves along with the perfect
timing of telling each characters story... with enough drama and action ... What More Can U Ask For..
See It !!!",1401667200,,508,4.850574712643678
6130952,4,B00H47IWES,"CGI is ok for the most part. In a couple scenes you can tell its computer generated and looks kinda cheap(first scene). The fighting in the movie is nothing great, average at best. Medium speed movements  for fighting and overuse of wires for high jumps and flying make this movie a decent to pretty good movie. There is some beautiful scenery and beautiful woman in the movie. The storyline is your average revenge movie.",1400716800,,422,4.702702702702703

8629688,4,B00H47IWES,"Let me start by saying what I enjoyed the most about this kung fu flick: the soundtrack!  Thats not a knock against the film at all but the music is lush and gorgeous throughout.  It prompted me to search for the soundtrack to this film which, alas, I haven't managed to find.  I put it up there with the soundtracks from The Last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (only better than the last one).  As for the film itself it grew more engaging as it went along but started off slow.  The fighting and action pieces are okay, not exceptionable, but the cinematography is great and the sets and locales are dripping with shades of green and earth tones.  Really beautiful, though the film has an unusual quality that makes it look less like a cinematic motion picture and more like a high quality televised movie.  Youll likely care about the lead characters by the middle of the movie but it takes some time as the acting wants to play it comically toned initially but later shifts to fawning and overreaching emotional charges like a daytime soap opera and finally to a serious drama.  I think it might have been hard for the actors to know how to inhabit their roles with all of the shifts, but they try.

In the end the bad guys are bad, the good guys have done some bad things, and there are confusing double- or triple-crosses?  I started having a hard time following it.  In Vietnamese with English subtitles.  Worthwhile if only for the music, but also for the color palette, and if you're able to be patient enough a story that finally draws you in.",1456444800,,1586,4.506993006993007

8629693,4,B00H47IWES,I've been trying to learn Vietnamese and the easiest way to learn a second language is by surrounding yourself with that language. This is why I was so excited to see this. It is extremely hard to find good quality Vietnamese cinema. I was amazed how well done this movie was. It's sort of similar to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon as far as style goes.
