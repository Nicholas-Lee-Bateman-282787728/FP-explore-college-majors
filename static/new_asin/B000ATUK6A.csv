8079828,1,B000ATUK6A,"I don't care if what Dean Lachiusa did to ""Night of the Living Dead"" is considered perfectly legal because it's a public domain film...it is still a CRIME against cinema and humanity, and an insult to the intelligence of all fans of the original film.

First, he destroys any tension or mystery about the origin of the ghouls with a completely unnecessary new introduction featuring the Venus probe (pieced together from NASA stock footage and animation that has obviously seen better days).  This is amateurishly done (you can even see the pixellation on some of the animation where it had to be blown up--possibly from an MPEG-1 video?), and along with the annoying narration it grates against the rest of the film like fingernails on a chalkboard...far worse than even any of the much-maligned added scenes in the 30th-anniversary edition of NOTLD.

Then he takes a film that was shot in black and white and was meant to be viewed in black and white and adds color tints to numerous scenes.  Now, back in the silent era, tinting scenes was a common practice, primarily to differentiate between times of day, as there was much day-for-night shooting at that time...but here, all it does is get in the way and cheapen Romero's efforts to create an atmosphere of fear and hopelessness within the black-and-white medium. In the summary for this version listed at the Internet Movie Data Base, Lachiusa boasts that he has also ""digitally enhanced"" the film with ""new camera angles.""  Bull.  If it's digitally enhanced, then why is the picture quality slightly lower than that of a bargain-basement VHS copy of the film?  I'll also let you in on a little secret--flipping the picture upside down and backwards and doing awkward and repetitive close-ups does not qualify as ""new camera angles.""  We're not morons, Mr. Lachiusa.  Please do not treat us as such.

The next faux pas is the complete removal of the television from the film, accompanied by an at-best clumsy attempt to gloss over the TV footage by trying to make the audience think that Tom and Ben lugged the radio into another room, and replacing any scene of the TV with repetitive close-ups of the radio...makes me wonder how one can explain how the radio magically returns to its original spot in the scenes during the final zombie attack.  This then created the necessity of cutting the footage of that introduces reporter Bill Cardille, the sheriff played by George Kosana, and the rest of the ghoul-hunting posse, not to mention one of my favorite lines of the film: ""Yeah, they're dead, they're...all messed up."" By the time we do meet the hunting party at the end of the film, they're essentially strangers, deprived of the introduction the original version gives through the TV coverage. Once again, our intelligence is insulted...those who have seen the original film will see right through this hack-job, and those who have not will likely be left scratching their heads.

Speaking of hack-jobs, a great deal of dialogue and supporting footage is excised from this version; while the original clocks in at about 96 minutes, this version is chopped down to 72 minutes; most of this is done little by little throughout the film.  The biggest cut (and the only one that makes any sense) is when Barbara starts to tell her story and the film flashes back to the original beginning in the graveyard (which had been pulled out of its rightful place to make way for the Venus probe intro).  Right before this, however, Ben's dialogue about his first encounter with the ghouls is severely truncated, leaving out some of the best acting of the whole film.  The cuts left me a bit disoriented as I kept thinking of scenes that weren't there anymore or moved around...

Finally, the DVD presentation itself is just laughable...there isn't even a proper scene selection menu--just the option to either play the movie or play the trailer.  Any kid with a mastery of Nerovision Express or some other DVD-authoring software could have done a better job!

Now, there might be those out there who can appreciate the artistic license taken in the making of this edition of NOTLD.  If you are one of those people, I take my hat off to you.  However, I can't help but view this treatment of a film that created an entire genre as disrespectful--to the story, to the audience, and to the genius of George A. Romero.  This movie was fine in its original form; the ""Survivor's Cut"" is a prime example of what happens when you try to fix what isn't broken.  View this one at your own risk.",1177286400,5,4536,4.773657289002558
8079829,3,B000ATUK6A,"I love the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", this version, I'm not so sure.  I like the idea someone else re-edittng the movie and making it their own, but this movie could of been re-editted better.  I am thinking that this is done with a movie editting tool like ""After Effects"", ""Premier"", or ""Final Cut Pro"".  I know a lot of the tricks used to re-edit this film.  The color transitions is a really easy trick to use in ""Final Cut Pro"", as well as the cutting of the film and transitioning it to other scenes.  He even used footage from other sources to tell the story of how the zombies came about.  I really think this could of been better.  I was expecting better, and was really excited to see this version of it, therefore I was somewhat disappointed in this version.  My advice is to see the original first, then see this one.",1127692800,13,839,4.333333333333333
8079830,5,B000ATUK6A,"Professional critics from sources like Creature Corner and Dread Central have given this film a fair shake.  The Survivor's Cut is well done and does justice to Romero.

I'm not ignorant or close minded, and I do not listen to the people that have written hateful critiques.  I think that an objective film audience will appreciate this version.  It's contemporary and fast moving while it also preserves GAR's vision.

 This is not exploitation like what you see in Anniversary, or Colorized versions -- or the many poor-quality prints on DVD and VHS.  Lachiusa obviously has put many man hours into this edit and I think he must have respect for the art of filmmaking to do such a fine job.

Without spoiling the film:  Check out the cool tinted scenes at just the right time...and Barb's shocked state of mind is well illustrated in a really cool ""magical box"" scene.  The colors grow more dynamic as the film moves on, it's really well done.",1127692800,7,945,4.7073170731707314
8079831,1,B000ATUK6A,"""CUT"" denotes the awful re-editing of this film, crappy monochromatice overlays, and use of cheesy filters to add atmosphere.  The added scenes (claiming to enchance the background of the story) are entirely [...]!  *read my reviews of other films, you'll see that I tend to be tolerant.  THIS film was a complete trashing of the original and went into the garbage the same moment I finished it.  It was NOT worth taking up what little shelf space it had been slated for. For the love of GOD, don't [...] on this - buy a powderpuff girls video or anything else, but this pile of grbage.",1126051200,20,586,4.552380952380952
8079832,1,B000ATUK6A,"Save your money and buy the real black and white, un-re-edited original.  This version misses out on the crumbling humanity of Romero's film by cutting most of the pertinent scenes.  A terrible waste of effort.

The Night of the Living Dead disc from Elite is a good buy.",1125878400,20,271,4.604166666666667
8079833,4,B000ATUK6A,"This film is like a whole new movie, but of course, Im a fan of the original as well. Definetly give this one a place in your collection.",1124409600,5,137,3.9285714285714284
