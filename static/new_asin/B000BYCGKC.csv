8690254,5,B000BYCGKC,"For those of you who remember 'The Uncle Floyd Show' (1974-1995), a local television program based in New Jersey, you will certainly  recognize the star of this movie. Michael Townsend Wright is a truly gifted performer whose versatility in every phase of show  business is very seldom seen today. I can only think back to the great vaudeville stars of the last century to describe his many  talents. He is a song-and-dance man with great comic timing, and also a fine actor. Please see his IMDB page and FaceBook page for  more details.
The film is a wonderful mix of comedy and pathos, with an excellent music score, and a director of photography who is inventive and  has a keen eye for detail. The opening credits and first few minutes will bear this out. Kudos to the director for  assembling a cast and crew who do justice to an uplifting story which rises far above the typical Hollywood-type picture. And my  applause to all of them for creating a memorable film that I enjoyed immensely. See the IMDB page for this movie for more details.  Buy it, rent it, whatever you like. But see it. You are in for a real treat!",1370736000,2,1125,4.534653465346534
