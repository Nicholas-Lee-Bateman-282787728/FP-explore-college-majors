There's plenty of fun and inspiration in this film, whether you're a veteran keeper of backyard chickens or your exposure to chickens is limited to those naked ones wrapped in plastic in the meat section of the local market.

In a delightfully light-hearted yet informative fashion, this DVD talks about the how and why we keep urban chickens, introduces us to some of colorful characters and inspires us to take a little bit better control over where our food comes from.

I've had urban chickens of my own for three years, and through my writing the [...], I thought I knew all there was to know about backyard chickens. Yet each time I watch Mad City Chickens, I learn a little bit more and I feel a little more connected to the community of folks who delight in raising chickens in their own backyard.",1269475200,,868,4.660130718954249
4111897,5,B003DDZTHU,"Love this film! It will inspire you to ""take the plunge"" into the world of backyard chickens. You'll be buying a few chicks and building your own coop before you know it. The documentary is informative and funny too. Go chickens!",1269475200,4,229,4.609756097560975

8394766,5,B003DDZTHU,"As backyard chicken-keepers, of course we loved this documentary...totally delighted with the whole creative thing! It is funny, informative and gripping in a very tongue-in-cheek...errr, make that -beak, sort of way! There was enough practical info to enlighten those considering keeping hens, while creating a proper balance of entertainment and serious info to inform a thoughtful family conversation. I suggest previewing it then watching it with the kids! But the quirky, humorous story line and the delightful ""found"" factory chicken are what engaged us 'til the end. We still talk about the lovely Consuela!",1323129600,,614,5.542553191489362
8394767,5,B003DDZTHU,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. In a very entertaining manner, it traces the history and phenomenon of backyard chicken raising. Being that beforehand, I knew just about absolutely nothing about chickens and the art of raising them, after watching this movie, I felt very inspired and encouraged, and have thoughts that one of these days, I'll have a flock of my own. It was definitely a learning experience, as well as life-changing for me. Laugh all you want at me - I never knew that chickens have character and personality and feelings. I used to actually dislike chickens. I thought they were mean animals. This film has shown me that they are not unlike any other animal. This movie has opened my eyes to the atrocities of factory farming, especially in the story of Consuela. As I am a meat eater, it has convinced me that in all fairness to the animal that has given up its life to grace my plate, the least I can do is to not eat factory-farmed food, and to not support such an evil business and way to treat animals.

This is a documentary - I wouldn't recommend it for children, unless they like watching educational shows. Do documentaries ever appeal to children? I'm inclined to say no. As for adults, I highly recommend it to those who have an interest in chickens, and raising them in your backyard, or just an interest in animals in general, and local color in Madison, WI.",1318118400,,1397,4.610441767068273
8394768,5,B003DDZTHU,"I am fortunate enough to live in the town where this movie was made.  When I first heard of it, I had the same thoughts as everyone else... ""Who would ever want to watch a documentary about some stupid chickens?""  Let me tell you my friends, you won't be disappointed.  I got a chance to meet the couple who made this movie and talk to them about the making of it.  What an eye opening experience that was.  As a budding documentary filmmaker myself, I learned so much by watching this movie. After watching it, I just look at the sleeve of the ""Urban Egg"" and giggle.  What a fun adventure.  A+++",1317168000,,597,4.276785714285714
8394769,1,B003DDZTHU,This video is BORING. The write-up would suggest that ideas and suggestions for the backyard chicken owner will be included. It actually is a poorly represented reality show. Don't waste your money.,1310601600,,198,5.21875
8394770,4,B003DDZTHU,"Definitely enjoyed the movie.  It's a nice combination of whimsical, tongue-in-cheek, and informative.  We do a tiny bit of gardening in our household, and we're certainly sympathetic to efforts by those working on a bigger scale than ourselves to incorporate animal wastes into their compost mix as a means of enriching the soil.  And I have no doubt that people who raise small farm animals at their homes treat those creatures far more humanely than the conditions which exist at today's concentrated industrial feedlots.  The movie's ""narrator"" was a grin; in my opinion equal parts Rod Serling and Steve Buscemi.",1285718400,,617,5.14
8394771,5,B003DDZTHU,"It is not often that a DVD arrives in the mail in the midst of a small-town debate on the same subject.  But that was the case here in Medford, WI. Mayor and City Council originally voted to ban backyard chickens outright. But citizens spoke up and now the matter is under reconsideration.

This DVD starts off on a kind of science fiction - 2001  --theme and then works its way into actual case studies of folks in Madison, Wisconsin who at first were part of a chicken underground. Then later the matter went to the City Council, with eloquence on both sides, fitting for the home of the University of Wisconsin.

It tracks chickens from birth to delivery to a happy family. Almost like an adopted child or two, or three (but not more than four in City). And the glow it gives to the family, but also the hard work, day after day.  Manageable, but necessary.  Also sometimes the initial housing for the chickens does not work, so something else required.

There are even foreign perspectives on home chickens. The DVD is put together so well, the viewer might wonder if an Indy Madison area film county had a super large travel budget.

And there are backyard chicken folks included from many areas.

There are some serious points to be made on the emerging backyard chicken experience, and they are made. But, as always, a dash of humor now and then makes it interesting, no matter what side of the fence, or chicken wire, you are on.

Get the movie, and look at it a couple of times. If you still want to try backyard chickens yourself, go for it.  We'll have to see if Medford, WI here follows with approval.
Otherwise, resident chickens will have to cross the road out of town.

8394772,5,B003DDZTHU,"Well, I'm certainly glad I read the other reviews. I was so excited to watch the movie, that I didn't realize there were deleted scenes! I found this film fascinating and heartwarming. It is informative, funny and educational. I loved the chicken that was saved at the garbage dump. Because after they are done being factory farmed, that's where they go, they are gassed and sent to the dump. But some don't die. This little chicken was so ragged looking when they captured her and turned into such a beauty! My baby chicks will arrive in 2 weeks and I am so excited. I have wanted chickens for as long as I can remember and this film just confirmed that having backyard chickens is the way to go!",1275177600,4,697,4.453125
8394773,5,B003DDZTHU,"Mad City Chickens is one of the best documentaries I have seen this year.  Full of information and funny as hell!  Tashai Lovington and Robert Lughai have made a wonderful film that I think ranks up there with the films of Morgan Spurlock and Ross McElwee.  What kind of people keep chickens in their urban neighborhoods, and why?  My Uncle was the only guy I ever knew who kept chickens; he was also a hunter and all around outdoors guy who did not live in a city.  Not so with the people that have been profiled in this documentary.  City Dwellers all.

But Mad City Chickens is not just about people who keep chickens; it deals with all sorts of other issues like making contact with the food we eat.  How the eggs from these chickens are so much better for us than the eggs from the giant industrial chicken farms.

I started watching this film thinking I was going to be watching a bunch of crazy people and came away with a lot of knowledge about the food we eat.  (I still think some of these people are a little nuts, but that's just me.)

I also loved some of the deleted scenes on the DVD extras.  What a hoot.  I give this DVD 5 stars and look forward to seeing their next film.

8394774,5,B003DDZTHU,"I recently saw this film for a second time (I'd attended it's premiere in Madison at the Wisconsin Film Festival) with my wife, who'd not seen it before. It really was a treat for both of us! My wife and I had noticed, with some interest and delight, the appearance of chickens being kept by a number of our neighbors in the past few years. And naturally, one wishes to know more about how one might care for them and/or how this situation might have come about. Well, this movie tells the whole story of the nationally growing phenomenon by detailing the local Madison scene -- and in the most entertaining of ways! My wife and I giggled and laughed while we were being educated. Really well done. It documents all details of the phenomenon with the greatest touches of humor and storytelling. Kudos, filmmakers! In fact, I just heard a radio program on the topic of the backyard chicken phenomenon in this country on Here On Earth (.org) (Friday, March 26th, 2010), in which Mad City Chickens was made mention of as a good source for learning more about certain details of the phenomenon. It's obvious that the season of the chicken (and her eggs) is upon us!",1269561600,2,1161,4.559808612440191
