8533874,5,B0091907SQ,"This program really surprised me, and I am delighted to have it.  Imagine an 1875 V&T locomotive actually under steam and running and with vintage V&T rolling stock to boot.  More than just running, this program is both a history lesson and a primer on 1875 locomotive technology and operation. Very interesting and informative in that it goes in to some of the nuts and bolts of preparing the locomotive for operation, as well as return to display status-but not in a heavy or overpowering way.  It is a pity that the INYO is only under steam twice a year (so the program states).  It is perhaps a miracle that the locomotives and rollling stock shown and operated even exist.  Thank the movie studios for that and thoughtful people who saw to its' preservation and restoration to operation.  A MUST HAVE for any steam fan!",1369872000,,824,4.6482758620689655
