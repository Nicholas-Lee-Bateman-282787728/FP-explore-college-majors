2452765,5,B000C3L2KM,I watched this show faithfully went it was on the Family Channel. This show is a good if not better then I remember it. I hope they release the rest of the series. This is a good clean western show that the whole family can enjoy.,1188950400,6,230,4.021739130434782

2452767,4,B000C3L2KM,"The show itself is great, its just as I remember them to be, but it would have been nice if there was order to the episodes. On all four discs the episodes are in random order so you really can't tell what episodes came first, second, or last. When I order a series I kinda want them to be in the order of production but I guess that was to difficult for them to do. The series overall is GREAT.",1174953600,3,395,3.95
2452768,5,B000C3L2KM,"Long before DQMW there was Bordertown, a half hour weekly western drama on the Family Channel. It ran for three seasons from 1989-1991, and was the Family Channel's highest rated original show. It was cancelled not due to ratings, but due to high production costs. 78 episodes were filmed. For some reason, this wonderful family drama has not been released on DVD in seasoned boxed sets. We only get 2 episodes from Season 1 and all of Season 3 (26 episodes.)

There is a difference between the boxed set and the four single volumes that were released. The boxed set has been digitally remastered. If you do not care about remastering, get the four individual volumes.

BORDERTOWN SUMMARY

Pemmican was a town in the western plains of North America near the 49th parallel (49 north latitude). It took until 1880 until the border was surveyed in the area of Pemmican, at which time it was found that the town straddled the border. In fact, the border goes through the local law enforcement office. In order to have proper and legal law enforcement, both Clive Bennett (John H. Brennan) and Jack Craddock (Richard Comar) have been stationed in the town. Clive is a colonel in the North West Mounted Police, and was formerly stationed in Toronto. Jack is a U.S. Marshal and a former Texas Ranger.

Each of these law officers is courting the fancy of Marie Dumont (Sophie Barjac). Marie and her husband (Jacque), both from Paris, lived in Bordertown until he died leaving Marie a widow. Marie is also the town's doctor and proprietor of the local general store. Marie has adopted Lucy, a girl whose parents have died.

2452769,5,B000C3L2KM,"I guess I should first disclose that I was in this show every season as much as I could be without becoming a cast member.  You can see me in the opening, cheering on the boxers.  I'm the 'farmer' who gets into a fight with the Chinese laundryman in the opening of one episode.  So, maybe I am a bit biased here.  As I recall, these programs were made for the Family Channel (Pat Robertson's channel) and some network in France.  The show was nominated for eight awards; I'm not sure if or how many they won.

All these programs will have some sort of little moral to the story.  To a great extent, they were patterned after the Bonanza shows [TV-Series 1959-1973], with each one focusing on some character who was just passing through Bordertown.  So, each episode has a very real human element, with each visitor having some kind of problem that needed solving.  There is no offensive language or any questionable activity.  It is a Western, so there are bad guys and they do get killed.  A lot of them, however, are given an extra chance to turn good before the lawmen have to resort to violence.  In short, it is a great Western, with episodes short enough that even younger kids can stay interested.  And, many of the shows provide ethical issues that would be beneficial for families to discuss.

A bit on 'inside' info:  Richard Comer was a really great guy and always very respectful and good to me; Barjac, and Brennan were a bit 'standoffish' to me.  The fight scene, which was in one episode (that you also see in the opening), was done when it was really, really cold.  We were freezing and we worked very late into the night to get that done.  In another episode there is a fight in the saloon where a character breaks the stair rail and falls down.  The room looks like it is full of 'smoke,' but it was really made from beeswax so is didn't hurt one's eyes or even smell bad!  In my fight with the Chinese guy, who had spooked my horse, which overturned my wagon load of chickens, after they called 'cut' everybody had to scramble about the town to catch all the chickens that were loose!  Another time, I remember we had a meeting in the 'church' which was at that point just the framing!

As for the town itself, it is made up of real buildings.  Therefore, the interior shots were done in real buildings, not stage rooms.  On rainy days, the streets were pure mud!  Since the show ended production, Bordertown has been used in many movies.  It is still there, so if anyone gets near Maple Ridge, British Columbia you might ask if it is open so you can see it.  I had a great time whenever I was in an episode, and I know you'll have a wonderful family time as you watch these wholesome shows!!",1159142400,57,2711,4.380761523046092
2452770,5,B000C3L2KM,"I agree with others who have commented on this.  The series was great and I love seeing it finally being released on DVD, but I sure wish they had released it in season sets instead of random episodes.  Still, I'll take whatever I can get!  This was a very enjoyable series.  They don't make 'em like this any more.",1143504000,11,315,4.288135593220339
2452771,4,B000C3L2KM,"Took a chance that this would be a new offering - could not find any information anywhere about this set.  Turns out to be a re-release of Volumes 1-4 already available individually.  I loved this series when it was on in the early 90s, just wish additional episodes would be released.",1134259200,32,285,4.568627450980392
8095616,5,B000C3L2KM,Bought this as a gift for someone who enjoyed watching the show back in the 90's. It was quite a hit.,1491523200,,101,3.857142857142857
8095617,5,B000C3L2KM,Loved this series and wished it had been a bit longer. Great interactions between all the characters. Clean family entertainment.,1408406400,,129,5.5
8095618,5,B000C3L2KM,This included part of the episodes for the Canadian TV show Bordertown. It was a show I really liked althought it was only half hour and could have had better stories. And this DVD could have had some more of what I considered the best episodes. Wish there was another one with the rest of the episodes as there weren't that many only 75 I think.,1356825600,,346,4.257575757575758
8095619,4,B000C3L2KM,"All the disks played fine. I will say that first. HOWEVER, the package consists of one tall DVD nipple with the DVDs all stacked on top of each other around it. And, they aren't loose. You have to unsnap them from the nipple, just like with any other DVD casing. In other words, every time you go to get one of the disks out of the package, you're in danger of cracking it...or worse, breaking it.

This is no reflection on the seller or Amazon. It's the manufacturer's issue.",1340150400,2,476,4.348314606741573
8095620,3,B000C3L2KM,"I remember watching Bordertown when I was a kid and I enjoyed it.
Now that I'm older I thought wouldn't be cool to see it all over again and catch the episodes that I missed as a kid.
I was looking forward to see this show from the beginning to it's end, all 3 seasons.

HAH!, yeah right, it doesn't tell you that what you're buying is only Season-3 on 3 discs, and 2 Episodes (FYI, the two episodes are the 2nd & 3rd episodes from season-1, titled ""Runners"" & ""Medicine Woman"" from Season-1 on the fourth disc).

You get none of Season-2 at all and nearly all of Season-1 is absent including the pilot episode.

I would not have paid for this product had I known what I was being shorted.

Also it turns out that this is the only thing that's available of this program, there's no alternate version or release that includes or covers the missing parts from this one.

Now I've seen many products from Canadian TV and Canadian film and show producers over the years and I've never really been unhappy with any of those products.

This Product was a Co-produced by French & Canadian companies.
I can only surmise that this is the result of the French Company's influence.
I can't see the Canadians selling such a sub-standard product.",1329782400,5,1233,4.457777777777777
8095621,5,B000C3L2KM,"I have been collecting western tv series for 3 years. I purchased  bordertown for two reasons,price and the reviews i had read.

8095622,5,B000C3L2KM,I loved this show when it was on in the early 90's and was so happy to find out that some of the episodes had been released on DVD. I would like to see the show in its entirety be released at some point though. This is definitely one of the best westerns I have ever watched.,1269043200,,275,3.8421052631578947
