5020142,4,B006US3UJ4,"Seen this in a movie festival first, then on DVD, and I'm not disappointed.
Sure the style is crude and the effects sometimes aren't perfect, but I think it's part of the experience at this point. Story is what matters in this movie, and character development... and there's lots of both. The mood and ambience are really perfect, though the music is sometimes too hardcore for what's happening on screen. John Glass is a nice protagonist with a very humane, anti-hero aspect to his personality.

This is a slow-paced sci-fi movie, inspired by italian post-apocalyptic B-movies from the 80's.
However, Hellacious Acres : the Case of John Glass proves that the genre isn't limited to half-assed storyline and crappy one-liners. This movie is artsy, tells a story, and finds a twisted way to be both ridiculously funny and incredibly sad at the same time.

5020143,1,B006US3UJ4,"All I can say is this is what happens when Jimmy BeardGuy and Jo Slacker get together to make a movie about Jimmy BeardGuy and Jo Slacker being put in a position where they actually have to do something of importance.  Jimmy BeardGuy and Jo Slacker wake up from suspended animation after the world has been destroyed by war then occupied by killer aliens.  The mission is to get readings from several machines and report those reading to command while evading the aliens then report to a secret location to help activate a device that will start to restore the planet.
First we meet Jo Slacker who whines and complains about his situation and during the process causes problems for himself such as destroying his navigation/information arm piece computer.  In comes Jimmy BeardGuy who whines and complains even more then gets liquefied by an alien.  Jo Slacker then pulls off Jimmy BeardGuy's arm with the computer intact and listens to Jimmy BeardGuy's whining audio logs while continuing to whine about his own mission.  Long story short, the movie goes nowhere and takes almost 2 hours to get there.  Jo Slacker fails to complete any part of his mission and is witness to the destruction of the device that will help restore the planet.  Jo Slacker is then liquefied by two aliens (thank God he did not breed first).  This ends the movie other than a fat half naked man running through a dead landscape.  This movie has no redeeming value: no acting, no plot, no special effects, no lesson (except that Jimmy BeardGuy and Jo Slacker live up to their loser reputations), and no point. I have to say it was a complete waste of $10.00 thus the poor rating.  Save your money on this one and use it to take a chance on some other piece of crap.",1334188800,4,1742,4.608414239482201
5020144,5,B006US3UJ4,its a very different movie and i was very pleased with it. what initially caught my attention was the cover of the dvd. its very low budget but shows what sort of great story can be told without much money,1334188800,,205,4.15
5020145,1,B006US3UJ4,"I read the only other review with the rater giving it 4 Stars - honestly if there was a zero star rating this would be a candidate - the plot is boring, the effects are minimal and crude (why that would be a plus is beyond me) - that the film was made with very little budget definitely shows, as does the lack of talent for direction and acting - this movie was truly a total waste of time.  I agree the heavy-metal industrial soundtrack is over-powering to the point of giving me a headache and really does not offer anything related to what is going on - as far as action - was none - other than pooping and puking thru a tube if that is action?",1333670400,5,648,4.0625
5020146,4,B006US3UJ4,"I had not heard anything about this film until a friend of mine stumbled across the DVD in the new releases for April 3rd where he works at. He liked the cover art and then was intrigued by the brief synopsis on the back of the case. He happened to mention it to me and I checked out some stuff about the film online and was intrigued by all of the positive reviews that I read about it.

Basically, the film is Pat Tremblay's vision as he directed, wrote, edited, co-scored the music and also did most of the visual & practical effects in the film. The film was made for little to no money but it's truly amazing what all Pat was able to pull off with the final product as this is one of the most entertaining, strange and original films that I've seen in a while. The basic plot involves a man named John Glass who awakens in a suspended status chamber in a decrepit barn in a containment suit. The cybernetic female voice informs him that while he has been in his state of suspended animation, the 3rd world war occured greatly decimating the entire world and then an alien invasion occured not too long after that. He is given instructions that he needs to go to a couple other barn locations, gather some data to help eventually try to get the atmosphere back to liveable conditions for humans to exist and then get to a final location in which he is supposed to be told exactly what all is going on but not until he completes his ""mission"" first. He is suffering from amnesia on top of this and is very perplexed to say the least.

The film is very up front right from the start that he's going to have to be walking to the other locations that are on his arm band computer device display and he also has a heads up display in his containment suit's helmet that makes the movie almost resemble a live action of recent post apocalyptic first person shooters such as ""Fallout 3"". As a result, a lot of the film is focused on his journey walking trying to get where he needs to go to and running across the occasional psychotic survivor, teleportation device or alien along the way. The movie is very slow but that is the point. It truly puts you in the same frame of mind as the title character and what he is having to endure. Some people won't like it and feel it's a test of their patience but others like myself who appreciate a good well made slow burn type movie will love it.

The film is presented on the DVD in 2.35 anamorphic widescreen with 2 channel stereo with no optional english subtitles. I mention the lack of subtitles in that my main beef with the film is that the loud pseudo metal/industrial soundtrack sometimes overpowers the dialogue and it can be touch to discern what is being said. I had to back the movie up a couple of times to be able to try to tell what was being said. The movie is very light on plot but there's a ton of moments of the Joe Glass character talking to himself or listening to pre-recorded audio on his suit's computer arm band device. As I stated earlier in my review, since this film was made for next to nothing, the visual quality is very sparse and rough but it suits the post apocalyptic feel of the movie perfectly. When special effects do happen, they're usually very minimalistic in nature and only to serve the story. The camera work is limited in terms of movement a lot of times but resembles in a lot of respects George Romero's Dawn of the Dead style in which he would get a ton of shot setups and then edit all of those together to give a great sense of movement and fluidity in terms of what is going on in a particular scene. The only extra is around 15 minutes of deleted scenes that aren't listed on the box. I would have loved to have had at least a commentary track to hear what all Pat had to say and how long it took him to get this project completed.

The biggest thing that I loved about this movie is the nice sense of humor that is put throughout the film that usually arises out of bizarre situations themselves and not as jokes per se. It's a truly unique hybrid that manages to combine horror, sci-fi, dark comedy and existential drama into something that is a low budget marvel. My only criticism would be the film's 1 hour 48 minute running time. It does tend to lag sometimes in some spots (particularly during the 1st act) more than the filmmaker probably intended for it to and possibly could have seen 15 to 20 minutes trimmed out to tighten it up a bit more. This feels more like an 85 to 90 minute movie at most but that is really the only problem that I had with it other than the audio issue I mentioned earlier with the music drowning out the dialogue in some spots.

If you are looking for something that is original and truly off the beaten path of the usual stuff Hollywood cranks out, I highly recommend this Canadian low budget marvel. Filmmaker Pat Tremblay is a true talent that knows exactly what he's doing in all respects to making a film such as this and I greatly look forward to future projects from him. Highly recommended!",1333497600,5,5029,4.306230200633579
8504657,3,B006US3UJ4,Cool film... the plot is a bit far out there. What they did with the budget is something to be praised though. The film has a post-apocalyptic setting but with a POV rpg video game feel to it... kinda feels like watching Fallout. The film is also pretty light-hearted... so good for a laugh as well. Check it out if the price is right.,1524441600,,335,4.25
8504658,5,B006US3UJ4,"It's bizarre as hell.  I went into this movie expecting nothing.  Watching it made me feel like I was going insane, and actually probably did permanent mental damage.  Nothing made sense for days afterwards and I still feel like I lost a part of myself, to have it replaced with something alien and hostile.

It isn't a comedy, or horror, or sci-fi movie.  It's a despair movie.  The awful despair of a senseless hostile world that no one would ask to be part of.  Absurdity that makes you laugh to keep from crying.  It is a tale of the human condition: brutal and insane.  Camus would run off a cliff after this movie, screaming about what a waste of time L'Etranger was.

Watching this movie will damage you, and not just through it's plot, imagery and music.  Even the pacing will make you realize how much of your life you've pissed away and how little it matters that you even exist.  You'll laugh, cry, scream, want your money back and eventually accept it's dark lessons.  You will not survive watching it, but something new will walk away wearing your skin.

So yah, I guess I'd say I really liked it.",1519948800,,1110,4.485
8504659,4,B006US3UJ4,"Though it is a bit of a slow burn, this is definitely one of the most artsy and tasteful low-budget trash film you will ever see. A perfect satire of the Fallout video game franchise. If you are a huge fan of RPG's, give this a try, you'll really dig the humor.",1475625600,,261,4.038461538461538
8504660,1,B006US3UJ4,"Nothing could have prepared me for this. I have watched some stinkers but this one topped them all. Having a tiny budget is fine but you need some skill to make the most of the little you have. Unfortunately the film rambles on doing almost nothing for 106 minutes when, because it doesn't have a lot to say, it really could have been made as a short film. The worst aspect was it seems to have been shot purposely to have appalling video properties - the quality is worse than watching an old VHS tape. So you can never really see what is happening. What you can see is shrouded in sepia tones most of the time. The problems are compounded by the sound design. The music overpowers any of the occasional speeches made by the actor so a lot of the time it's virtually impossible to hear what he is saying. The result is an unnecessarily long film, light on story, awful to look at and incredibly difficult to hear.",1457913600,2,914,4.350877192982456
8504661,1,B006US3UJ4,Dumbest movie ever a two hour bore fest of a man walking around for two hour movie was pointless and the special effects a kindergartener could have done better,1427155200,,160,4.551724137931035
8504662,1,B006US3UJ4,This movie was strange (not in a good way) no particular plot that I could figure out and extremely boring.,1382486400,,107,4.4
8504663,1,B006US3UJ4,"Nice try...but this one fails on most counts.  There's nothing ""Bloody Disgusting"" about it other than the cinematography, special effects, soundtrack and storyline.  The acting is non-existent.  So far, I've seen all but two of the Bloody Disgusting collection films.  Only ""Yellowbrick Road"" lived up to the promo...so far.  What bothered me most was how S-L-O-W thisk moved along.  In fact, it didn't move along at all.  With a nickel and dime budget, I recommend you avoid this unless it's the only movie available and you have a couple of hours to waste.",1349308800,2,559,4.946236559139785
8504664,1,B006US3UJ4,"This movie is good to get that sunday afternoon nap going. I find anything more than one star suspect. Sometimes reviews get pumped by people with a financial interest or maybe friends involved in the movie. Do not get suckered into paying anything for this one. It is really bad.
But I never eat the green in the lobster so maybe I am just to unsophisticated to enjoy crap.",1345680000,,374,4.434782608695652
8504665,4,B006US3UJ4,"First of all don't listen to the guy who gave it one star. The movie is low budget but it gives the movie that post-apocalyptic feel. It has a real video game feel to it and it is supposed to be poking fun at post-apocalyptic video games which works out. The movie is hilarious and just fun to watch. It reminds me of an 80's sci-fi movie, kind of slow paced but interesting character development and story. And of course epic music to go along with it. The movie is worth watching. And I honestly want to know more of the story after watching it.",1338076800,2,547,4.219047619047619
8504666,4,B006US3UJ4,"I didn't read the background or purpose of this movie prior to watching it...an initial error but ultimately it won't taint the viewing experience if you do it (if you're reading this review without seeing it...stop here).

So I viewed the movie as being a serious micro budget film before researching it.  In reality it actually works in that context despite the horrible costumes and meh effects.  It's not actually a bad movie, it's pretty interesting to watch without knowing what's going on here.

Anyway, see the title of the movie?  Yeah...that's not some post-apocalyptic movie jargon to describe the plot of the movie, it's actually supposed to be hell to watch.  It's long, the guy sits there doing random stuff, some of the plot doesn't make sense, the effects aren't great, the set pieces aren't great, the dialog is bizarre, etc.  It's meant to be that way.  It's an homage to the b movies of the distant past...think a color version of lost skeleton of cadavra that's more bizarre.

On that count (being an homage) it actually fails because it's far too watchable, funny, and interesting (at least to me) to take it's place in the mst3k theater of horrors.  Definitely rent it and see if you want to add it to your collection.  Just um...grab a couple of beers for the show otherwise you'll wonder why the guy is talking to a cigarette butt.

4 and a half stars.",1335571200,3,1376,4.66390041493776
