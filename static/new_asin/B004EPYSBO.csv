4361883,4,B004EPYSBO,"I started watching this show from the Netflix offerings.  It was out of order and presented only HALF of the episodes.  I'm a purist and wanted to see EVERYTHING and IN ORDER.  As long as you can handle Region 2/PAL DVDs, this is a great set.  AND it was just released in 2011!  It's a shame that the BBC ERASED so many of their great early comedies.  Thank you, Mr. Wilson.  You Labour twit!",1309392000,7,392,4.216216216216216

8427572,5,B004EPYSBO,"I love my BBC series. It is my way of escaping my own world for a while. British comedy for the most part is clever and far from dark. In this particular series the star is a clumsy young married guy who gets into the oddest  predicaments... Some I have done myself and a lot that I imagine myself doing. He has a wife that while sometimes frustrated will remain at her husbands side. No matter what. The jokes are not racial, classes or really anything to make someone feel hurt by. This is situational comedy. The only thing that may feel complex to Americans is that life is funny all by itself. I recommended this series. The comedy may seem a bit dry, but so is my life at times. Not everyone of my jokes is a knee slapping, rolling on the floor, choking joke. Good stuff. So grab some tea and some crackers, cheese and grapes. Or grab some soda, chips n dip along with a foot long sub sandwich. This may remind you of the three stooges a little. If that is what you want...you have found it. I have my special BBC time and enjoy a great time laughing at life itself. Join me.",1386201600,5,1081,4.197115384615385
8427573,5,B004EPYSBO,This is one of the funniest series I have ever seen.  I am so glad it is out on DVD but wish it were zoned for the United States.  I will be buying a new Free zone DVD player next so I can play it.  I have the VHS version now.  All of the DVD's should tell you in the descriptions if you need a special player to view it.  When you first see the star it is hard to believe that he is the same Michael Crawford that starred in Phantom of the Opera.  He is wonderful.,1386028800,4,465,3.693877551020408
8427574,5,B004EPYSBO,This series is side splitting.  We've enjoyed it a couple of times over.  The slapstick and timing really showcase Mr. Crawford's talent.,1364515200,2,137,5.181818181818182
8427575,5,B004EPYSBO,"terrific comedy, did his own stunts and they are actually great stunts
