31135,5,0780615573,"I'll just add to what others have said:  this film is a heck of a lot of fun.  Ginger has never been more delightful.  Charles Coburn is his usual magnificent self (and gets off the movie's best line:  ""I don't care  who the father is, I am the grandfather!""  And David Niven, who I have  always found likeable but inexplicably overrated, is much more agreeable  than usual.
Although my favorite Ginger Rogers films are those she made  with Herr Astaire, she would have been one of my favorites merely by the  quality of such films as this one and THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR.",941760000,10,572,4.413461538461538
31136,5,0780615573,I saw this movie when I was young and didn't see it again for years. Now I have the video and watch it over and over again. Ginger Rogers and David Niven do an excellent job of making me laugh in this movie. The story  itself is truly comical. David Niven's father is so convinced the baby  looks just like him in this movie. Everything about this movie is funny in  my books and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh. This is  the way movies should still be made! It's a classic to me!!,940636800,3,500,4.071428571428571
31137,3,0780615573,"At the beginning of the movie Ginger Rogers witnesses someone dropping a baby off on the steps of an orphanage on a winter day.  She thinks that the baby needs to be inside out of the cold so she steps in and does the good  deed of taking it inside to complete the delivery.  When the orphanage  won't accept her story about being a passerby she finds herself literally  left holding the bag, with the baby in it.  The rest of the story is full  of the misadventures that come with trying to juggle a single woman's urban  life with demands of caring for a baby.  Come to think of it, it took three  men (Danson, Selleck, and Guttenberg) in ""Three Men and a Baby""  to equal Ginger Rogers in this movie.  Both of the movies work.
I'd  recommend this movie, but it's certainly not a classic in my mind.",931737600,6,800,4.253333333333333
31138,5,0780615573,"Longtime Fred Astaire fans may not know any other chemistry ever existed for his usual partner Ginger Rogers, but in this excellent Mother's Day special showing (on American Movie Classics) David Niven gets a chance to  draw romantic AND maternal value out of a downcast Polly (Rogers), who has  apparently lost her job selling toys. It works out that if Polly  voluntarily adopts a charming baby boy, she gets to keep her job at  freshman romantic-lead David (Niven)'s family business, showcase her  jitterbug, and even find real romance.  I never realized how delightful and  funny Rogers could be, in this mainly non-dancing romantic comedy. I will  purchase & watch it many times, because it led to settling a big  argument with my own mother, on Mother's Day, no less !",926294400,3,774,4.892307692307693

31142,4,0780615573,"It's nice to see Ginger Rogers with a different male co-star than Fred Astaire.  She shows she has comic talent on her own, without Fred and a dance number.  She is beautiful in the movie, and David Niven and Charles Coburn are worthy support.  You will laugh outlaid in the dining room scene between Niven, as the son, Coburn, as the irate fatter, and E.

31159,5,0780615573,"Polly's friend (staring at the baby): ""Where did it come from?""
Polly: ""I got it for Christmas.""
Polly's friend: ""This Christmas... or last Christmas?""

Lovely and multi-talented, and a best actress Oscar winner, Ginger Rogers may be chagrined to find that, today, she's still best known as Fred Astaire's dancing partner. But there's no denying Ginger's skills. A wonderful comedienne and an accomplished dramatic actress, the girl can sing and dance and, brother, she can even act. Her star ascended with Astaire, but after nine very successful but rigorous films with him, Ginger took a break from musicals. Her very next project was 1939's sparkling romantic comedy BACHELOR MOTHER, made at the peak of her career. We all know how many all-time classics were released in that fabled year, so the fact that this picture was a tremendous box office hit speaks for itself. This movie was remade in 1956 by RKO as BUNDLE OF JOY, starring Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. While a good comedy in its own right, it's not as well regarded and doesn't quite measure up to BACHELOR MOTHER.

It's Christmas time in New York City, and department store salesgirl Polly Parrish (Rogers) has just been notified of her end-of-the-day sacking. Departing from work she strolls by an orphanage and witnesses a woman abandoning a baby at the front steps. With the woman having fled, Polly picks up the baby as, moments later, the door to the orphanage opens, and here comes the mistaken identity. Now no one believes that Polly's not the mother. Her department store, Merlin's, comes to her aid, reinstating her in her salesgirl position. Even young David Merlin (David Niven), heir to the business, drops by to give unsound baby advice. What's a girl to do?

BACHELOR MOTHER is a feel good movie, simply ideal for the holidays. The movie does a good job of balancing its sentimental sappiness with a playful, even subversive, sense of humor. There's even a dig at the stuffed shirt bureaucracy of businesses like Merlin's. The top notch cast manages to keep everything grounded and plausible, in spite of the zaniness that colors the film. With BACHELOR MOTHER Ginger again shows that she does have drawing power without Fred Astaire. As the working class bachelorette who has motherhood abruptly thrust upon her, Ginger's never been more engaging or funny. Her performance is nicely subdued and reveals a tender and vulnerable side. While it's wholly understandable that her young and fancy free character would rebel at being saddled with a strange infant, it's not too farfetched that she soon falls in love with the kid. Ginger is very good here. And she even gets a chance to do some hoofing in a dance competition.

Classy David Niven turns in a performance which shouldn't be short-changed. After various solid supporting roles, this is where he graduated to his first romantic comedy lead, and he's a natural. Chemistry is never guaranteed, but David and Ginger prove to have it in bunches. They make a charming couple, and I relished their back and forth patter and how they played off each other. Meanwhile, a movie can't ever go wrong by featuring Charles Coburn. He's up there on my list of all-time character actors, along with, let's say, Claude Raines, Edward Arnold, Eugene Pallette, S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall, and Walter Brennan. As David's father who longs for a grandson, Coburn brings instant onscreen credibility. And, of course, one must never, never underestimate the cuteness of a baby.

In the Apropos of Nothing Department: What are the odds that I'd pop in two old comedies in a row and hear Donald Duck noises from both? First, in the entertaining 1938 screwball comedy JOY OF LIVING (just finished it some hours ago). And, now, in BACHELOR MOTHER. Coincidence? Well, yeah, probably.",1474675200,,3793,4.9575471698113205

31232,5,0780615573,"This rollicking movie has everything you could hope to find in a rom-com and just don't anymore:  a smart and plucky heroine, a playboy with a sense of decency, a witty, double-entendre screenplay, and a major dilemma.  When holiday temp worker Polly Parrish goes to the aid of a baby left on a foundling home doorstep, everyone assumes the child is hers--and well-intentioned miscommunications and muddles abound.

As Polly, Ginger Rogers knocks the ball out of the park, demonstrating again that she is one of the most underrated actresses of her generation.  Her comedic timing is as superb as her dance timing--she speaks and reacts in such a perfectly natural and likeable way you can't wait to see how she's going to handle the next bump in the road. You're rooting for her from the very first frame and absolutely cheering for her by the movie's end.

She is equally matched by David Niven, who has never been more appealing than in his role as her employer's dashing son. They have wonderful chemistry as they alternately spar and join forces.  Their scene together at a fancy New Year's Eve party is flat-out hilarious. Rogers and Niven seem to have a blast as they pull the wool over the eyes of some disagreeable tablemates, and this sense of fun just zings off the screen. This segues into a more tender moment that manages to have plenty of sexual tension while remaining sweetly innocent.

I think children will love this film (among other things it includes a denouement with a mechanical duck), but adults of all ages will enjoy it because of the acting, the snarl of misunderstandings, the humor, and how niftily screenwriter Norman Krasna flirts with innuendo without ever crossing the line. And the baby is adorable!

Although very different in subject matter and tone, it reminds me a bit of ""Roman Holiday"" and ""While You Were Sleeping"" in showcasing two incredibly personable actors at their charming best and in situations that are both identifiable and yet modern fairy tales.

Here's hoping it will get the first-class restoration it deserves, as the current copy is a bit grainy and offers no extras.

However, it is such a terrific film, it's easy to overlook any technical flaws. ""Bachelor Mother"" is definitely becoming one of my Christmas traditions.",1391904000,,2280,4.883419689119171

It has plot holes you could drive an 18-wheeler through, with room for a motorcycle escort, and the print, while clean, is over-saturated.  And you know what?  My dear, I don't give a damn.  It is simply everything a romantic comedy should be--perfectly cast, brilliantly written and directed, and showing off a comedic flair no one knew Ginger had.  And, for someone who feared for a long time that he would never have grandchildren, the inimitable Charles Coburn almost steals the movie.  ""I don't care who the father is, I'm the grandfather!"".  His spoon-throwing episode, with the poor baffled butler, is a high point of the show.  In short, if you don't enjoy this, you may have all the brains in the world, but you ain't got no heart.

Had Bachelor Mother been released in 1938 or 1940, then it would be widely regarded as one of the best comedies ever made, right up there with Young Frankenstein, which was certainly the funniest movie ever made.

If you are looking for a clean and yet well written and acted movie, this is one of the best. Its pretty funny too.

However, I couldn't give it five stars, because like others I feel the video quality leaves something to be desired. Its not terrible or altogether distracting, but for $20 it should be better. The sound is fine and the video is much better than my old VHS, but for the price I expect a little better quality. Also there isn't much of a menu for the DVD, or even chapters. Seems to be thrown together production wise and then sold for more than it should as its the only one out there.

31257,4,0780615573,"In my attempt to watch every movie made in the year that was 1939 (a goal I think every cinephille should set), I stumbled across this little movie I'd never heard of but I was surprised to hear actually made real bank back in that year.  Yes, Ginger Rogers heads an impressive cast in this Garson Kanin comedy about a young department store clerk who stumbles across a baby being left at an orphanage.  She feels pity on the young soul and bends down to comfort him just as the doors are opened and she is assumed the baby's mother.  She obviously denies this and flees, but the orphanage tracks her down and soon everyone believes it is her child.

The improbability of this film is somewhat irritating at times.  I just find it preposterous to suggest that absolutely no one could come to Polly's defense and prove that this child wasn't hers.  I understand that it was yesteryear and so they couldn't do any DNA testing as proof, but surely the woman had friends or family that saw her regularly and could say ""hey, I've been around her for years and she's never sported a baby bump"".  I know that this is fictional and I know that this is a comedy, which is why I forgive it some of its ridiculousness (and obviously why I still give it a higher grade) but I do like my comedies to have a level of wits about them and I would be lying if I said that that fact didn't glare in my mind's eye throughout the bulk of this film.

That said, Ginger Rogers is delightfully mesmerizing here, and David Niven really steals the young employer who falls madly in love with her after attempting to `help her out'.  I'm a sucker for Charles Coburn as well, and so I was excited to see him have such a plum role here.

There is enough charm to go on for days here, despite the fact that the film is under an hour and a half in length.  It certainly makes the most of its running time, delivering laughs at almost every corner. Honestly, outside of a certain issue, I can't really fault the film at all.  It is fun and sweet and charming and it stands the test of time as well.  There are many memorable scenes here, most notably the dinner scene in which Rogers pretends to be a Swedish heiress who cannot speak English.  Her comedic chops are certainly on full display.  I will note, as I already have to a degree, that David Niven is the standout here.  I just thought he was outstandingly in tune with the internal flow of the film.  He captured the shock and surprise and genuine concern of his character, gradually developing young Merlin with ease.

So watch it.  It's a little known gem of a film that will bring a genuine smile!",1326326400,5,2627,4.335378323108385

She hated the script and had to be threatened with a release from her contract to do it. She went to a pre-release screening of the film, during which the audience was literally falling on the floor laughing. Afterward she said, ""I told you it was a dog."" (I got this story from a PBS documentary.) The film was so popular that Rogers went easier on it in her autobiography, GINGER: MY STORY. It's a rom-com for the ages, with funny slapstick and a great leading man in David Niven at his handsomest. Charles Coburn has perhaps his best line in a film: ""You may not be the mother, and you may not be the father, but I'm the grandfather!"" The film is canny about class differences, but it's basically a Cinderella story at its most sophisticated (the original story by Felix Jackson got an Oscar nomination).

Not until Preston Sturges retired the trophy for good with ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Miracle-of-Morgan-s-Creek/dp/B0009W5J78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Miracle of Morgan's Creek</a>&nbsp;would any American film treat 'sacred' motherhood with such audacity.

Wouldn't it be nice if American film fans could buy all their classic films here in the States, and not be forced to turn to France!

31279,4,0780615573,"One of the best Christmas movies around and Turner showed it last night while we were sitting around addressing Christmas packages to my native France.  At first I was like, meh, since it stars two of my all time least favorite stars in Hollywood, but you know what?  Maybe it was the multiple egg nogs, or the tinsel beckoning on the Dutch elm, but I wound up enjoying both Ginger Rogers and David Niven very much.  They were each more talented than I gave them credit for, though to me, and maybe this is just a personal thing, I just don't see Niven as the sort of heartthrob that all the girls in the department store would swoon over (and the guys too, all falling over themselves to butter him up when he deigns to grace the toy department).

In fact although I wound up liking Niven, I wound up disliking his character intensely.  In one sequence he takes Ginger Rogers to a high society New Years Eve party, and when she expresses nervousness about conversing with her betters at the dinner table, he doesn't say to her, you're as good as anyone else, he just passes her off as Swedish (unable to speak a word of English).  I remember in the Mapp and Lucia books this would often happen--I wonder if Garson Kanin who wrote this screenplay was familiar with the classic comic novels of E F Benson--only difference is if Benson wrote the screenplay Ginger would have been horrified when an actual Swedish speaker came up and tried to talk with her in what he would presume was her native tongue.  Anyhow Niven is thoroughly class bound in this inter-class comedy, and if it weren't for the baby it wouldn't have been half as much fun.  Who played that baby, anyhow?  Probably dozens of little infants, since ""John"" changes every time a new expression is needed to show on his face, but whoever they were, they were darned cute kids.  Probably around 70 now--wonder if any of them are still alive?

Another one who probably watched this movie was Lucille Ball, Ginger's great friend in real life, for one realizes watching it that everything Lucy did on her later TV series, Ginger was doing in this movie.  Ginger also has two wonderful dance numbers.",1198368000,2,2157,4.5595854922279795
31280,5,0780615573,"Polly Parrish(Ginger Rogers), a temp at Merlin's department store, received 2 Christmas presents, her pink slip, since the holiday rush would be over soon, and a baby during her lunch break.

As she told them at the foundling home, ""I wasn't leaving it... I was just picking it up."" No matter, she was stuck. They had her employer's name, and were determined to keep this 'family' together.

With the help of David Merlin (David Niven), and a lot of other do-gooders, Polly manages to get tangled up in diapers(or scarves) and safety pins, rattles and baby books. The whole time, slowly falling for little Joan, I mean John, and an unsuspecting David is getting caught in the playpen as well.

With a superb cast, and a great director, this is a definite must-see.

I taped this movie off TV during an all-day Ginger Rogers movie marathon. I think it was her birthday. Because of Hurricane Floyd and the flood that followed I do not know the wherabouts of my movie.

31281,5,0780615573,"Wonderful movie, I have watched my copy at least 20 times over the years!  I love the sassy verbage used, and the lovely clothes!  This movie is not one of her dancing musicals however, it is funny and superb! This is one of my few all time favorite movies ... great movie to watch with your family on a rainy day with some cocoa!",1138665600,7,330,4.140625
31282,5,0780615573,"Garson Kanin directed this Norman Krasna screenplay and if you ever doubt the magic of Ginger Rogers you have only to watch this film for absolute proof. The always loveable Charles Coburn and a young, dashing and very funny David Niven help this become a true classic. Ginger gives a sweet and comical performance that is a reminder of just how great she really was.

Ginger plays Polly Parrish, temporary Christmas help at Merlin & Son's department store. Charles Coburn is J. B. Merlin and David Niven is his footloose son David. Ginger is given her pink slip along with the other Christmas help and upon leaving the store comes across an old woman leaving a small baby on the steps of an orphanage. Ginger of course picks the baby up as the door opens and from here on in everyone assumes it's hers!

When she leaves the baby there it is traced back to her former employer and Niven agrees to keep her on so she can keep her baby! Ginger gets tired of explaining how it's not her baby and since she is slowly but surely becoming the baby's mother anyway she gives in. A very funny Niven keeps stopping buy to ""help"" and he and Ginger have some truly nice moments together.

When Niven is stood up on New Year's Eve he stops by to get Ginger and once the clothes and fur coat arrive they are off to rub it in the face of the stuffy girl who stood him up. To Ginger's shock he introduces her as a Swedish girl who can't speak a word of english! It's hilarious as they make up a language that's anything but Swedish and Ginger is the toast of the party, dancing with everyone. The scene after the date, as Ginger talks to her baby about it will make you fall in love with her.

When a disgruntled employee tells Coburn that the baby is his son's, he is overjoyed to have a grandson. The attempts of Niven and Ginger to convince him otherwise turns to hilarity when they both produce the actual ""father"" of Ginger's baby, at the same time! The baby really is Ginger's by now and Niven, of course, realizes he loves both of them.

Ginger Rogers was a wonderful light comedic actress and along with ""Lucky Partners"" with Ronald Coleman, ""Fifth Avenue Girl,"" and her Oscar winning ""Kitty Foyle,"" this is one of her finest films. This is a great comedy you'll watch more than once. Ginger Rogers was the sweet American girl next door. She was never prettier than in this film and simply exudes a luminous charm in every scene. This might just be her finest performance.

This is a movie that will have you laughing or smiling all the way through. Anyone who ever questions the importance of Ginger Rogers in American cinema need only be reminded that in the tiny annex where Anne Frank spent so much time, where every inch of space was precious and guarded, was a torn out picture from a movie magazine---- of Ginger Rogers.",1111622400,64,2820,4.434362934362935
31283,5,0780615573,"I have watched this movie every year around the holidays since I can remember.  It is innocent enough for children yet entertaining for adults.

During her lunch our, Polly Parish finds her life will never be the same as she finds herself is a comical chain of circumstances, with all fingers pointing to her as the mother of an abandoned child.  After trying to convince everyone around her that she is not the mother, she finally accepts responsibility for this bundle, eventually becoming so attached to the child that she fights to keep him.

Ginger Rogers is delightful as always, with David Niven fitting in his role like fingers in a glove.  A must-see classic!",1104278400,30,668,4.773913043478261
31284,5,0780615573,"This is a hilarious comedy of assumptions with a very strong cast.  Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn all star in this delightful comedy.
Ginger Rogers is a store clerk who happens to see a woman leaving a baby at the door of a church.  She rushes forward to tell the woman not to do such a thing when suddenly the woman flees and the door opens.  Ginger is assumed to be the mother of the baby and the priest insists that she keeps the child.  And from there the story springs.
The Church, in their role of helping, interferes at the store to make sure Ginger keeps her job so that she can raise the child.  This brings her to the attention of her boss.  Fascination and romance follow.
Ginger is like a rider on a roller coaster. She can not get off or change things.  She must hold on as best she can until the ride ends.
This movie is wonderful and delightful, but only really works if one accepts the innocent nature of films of the day.  Ginger is accused of having a baby.  Even the people she has worked with every day believe it.  All this despite that fact that in the movie Ginger has a waist of about sixteen inches and there is no way she could have been pregnant without everyone seeing her condition.  But that aside, it is a truly wonderful film.",1066694400,10,1274,4.266666666666667
31285,5,0780615573,"There is nothing quite like trying to explain yourself when no one will listen or believe you. It is even worse when you are held responsible for everything you didn't do.

The young and beautiful unmarried Polly Parish (Ginger Rogers) finds herself in just such a comical situation when one day she passes a orphanage and sees a woman leaving a baby on the stairs. Before she can stop the woman, she finds herself picking up the baby for fear it will roll off the steps. The door opens and everyone assumes this is her baby. Frustrated, she leaves and won't assume responsibility for the child. Later the baby is returned to her and she takes a liking to the cute little bundle of fun.

On the same day she is fired from her department store job and this makes everyone believe she has had to give up her child due to her job loss. Of course, it gets even more comical when everyone assumes the department store owner (David Niven) is the father.

If I tell you too much about this movie, it will simply spoil the plot. It is similar to a comedy of errors in which everyone makes the wrong assumptions and takes action on what they consider to be the facts.

I really had great fun watching this movie, although seeing such a cute baby in this movie started to get the maternal clock ticking again.

It is interesting to note that Ginger Rogers ""at first"" refused to appear in this movie, however she was somehow convinced to play the part. This was one of her early attempts at doing straight comedy.

Quite a lovely classic comedy.

31286,5,0780615573,"As a shop girl, Ginger Rogers picks up a tiny baby she finds on the stoop of a foundling home and carries it inside.  The officials inside believe Rogers to be the mother.........RKO's boy wonder of 1939 was Garson Kanin; the unknown novice director was 25 when he brillianty directed John Barrymore in THE GREAT MAN VOTES; he was rewarded by directing the studio's brightest star, Ginger Rogers in BACHELOR MOTHER. The vivacious Ginger Rogers had one of her best comedy roles in this movie, and along with her performances in STAGE DOOR (1937) and VIVACIOUS LADY (1938) she proved to audiences and critics alike that she was indeed capable of doing more than dance beautifully with Fred Astaire.  A slight but dextrously handled comedy, it's story is less than a screen classic, but Garson's neat touches and the engaging presence of Ginger Rogers make it a throughly enjoyable diversion.  It handles a questionable theme with good taste and finesse.",1004659200,3,951,4.93125

31288,4,0780615573,"Director Kanin has been called the Douglas Sirk of comedy: like the German auteur,, he takes a popular genre (here the romantic comedy), subverts it while retaining its pleasures.  This is a film which takes the conservative 'idea' that capitalism is natural and appropriately symbolised in the family, and exposes it as nonsense.  Having a child, making a family, being a mother is the least natural thing in the world, a combination  of cynicism and chance.  The film's ambiguous title suggests the character most in need of a mother is the bachelor, a sensational David Niven becoming, er, David Niven.  That the film remains romantic AND comic confirms its brilliance.",987552000,5,672,5.072727272727272
