8596315,4,B00DQE82UW,Great DVD but I don't like that they use the word queer in it. Even if nothing is meant by it.,1377302400,,94,3.5238095238095237
8596316,5,B00DQE82UW,"This video is great; my son loves it! The ABC song must be very catchy for children as I caught him singing it right after the movie was over the first time we watched it. I really like how the ABC song is repeated three times  (first with upper case, then with lower case, then with both upper and lower case letters).

Also, I found I was learning a lot with the video as well. For instance, X is for xiqua fruit? I had never heard of xiqua before (I actually had to google it after the video was over)! I loved how there were some unusual/different types of examples in the video to help build the children's (and parent's!) vocabulary. It seems like a lot of times you see the same examples given over and over in children's videos and books, i.e. - C=cat, D=dog, etc. This video pulls out lots of different things - G=guava, etc. and helps teach children different objects (that they may not already know) as well as the phonics for the objects. It was so refreshing to see different examples for the letters in the video.

Another great video from Monkisee - we have so many of their products and love them all!",1373673600,2,1117,4.3349282296650715
8596317,5,B00DQE82UW,My grandchildren loved this DVD! It has quickly become their favorite one to watch. And my husband and I enjoyed it as well. It is so entertaining. The songs are very catchy and we end up singing them when there are no little ones staying with us. From the first time I put the DVD on the children were mesmorized. They sat thru the entire videowithout getting up once. I just know your children or grandchildren will love itas much as mine.,1373328000,,441,4.390243902439025
