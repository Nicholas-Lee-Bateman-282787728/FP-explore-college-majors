8373121,5,B002LI6X2I,"Very good presentation...I didn't expect much and thought it was material that I had previously seen but it wasn't.  It's presented like a documentary you'd see in grade school but it's a good, short, compete history you to the early 1900s.  Only two complaints, during the last presentation, there are a couple of spots where the picture freezes.  Also, it would've been nice to make another section to bring it up to the transition from steam to diesel.",1488672000,,455,4.8076923076923075

8373125,3,B002LI6X2I,"Much too short for a good,even a mediocre history. Very slow going and history very narrow and pictures boring and muddled. Wouldn't recommend to anyone interested in railroad history.",1396828800,,184,5.379310344827586

8373127,4,B002LI6X2I,"Once again, it contains material available on videos I have previously purchased.  If you have no other such videos you will undoubtedly like this one.  I keep hoping the History Channel will do another one as they seem to use material that is not seen on every train video available.  I guess the need to view steam trains is a sign of old age and incipient nostalgia syndrome.",1344729600,6,378,4.529411764705882
