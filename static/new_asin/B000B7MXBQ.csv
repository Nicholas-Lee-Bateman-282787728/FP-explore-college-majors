8082807,1,B000B7MXBQ,"I bought the 2007 making of the Du Stade French Rugby Calendar and the making of the firefighter calendar together and you cannot compare the two.

I suggest you get ALL the French making of Calendars before you waste your time on this.

I am very disappointed in this dvd.",1176163200,12,273,4.44
8082808,2,B000B7MXBQ,"The cover model (or firefighter) is beautiful, sexy, and provocative. One may think this video has much to offer. Well, no, it's not. Even if the mission and vision of putting together this calendar may be noble (Firefighter Fundraising - we often think back to 9/11, and the many lives we have lost, among others).

The video is boring and truly disappointing. It just doesn't flow and, unfortunately, it is not in tune with the message the cover is trying to send. If you feel generous you rather send a donation to the firefighters directly. Do not waste time and expectations buying this video. It's not worth it.",1170720000,20,617,4.712962962962963
