4321596,5,B004C03TK2,"I did not know the story of ""Big Red"" aka ""Secretariat"" before yesterday when I went to see this movie. I do believe I was the only one in the theatre who did not know the out come for all through the movie I felt as though I was the only one clapping, or gripping the side arms of my seat..... the movie about made my heart burst due to the anticipation and desire for the underdog to win!  I loved the racing scenes in this film, the beauty of a horse running and running, flexing everyone of it's muscles, doing what it knows it was born to do!  The communication/love between Big Red and his owner is heart breaking and one that a true animal lover can relate to.  This film was expertly done and I encourage everyone to go see ""Secretariat""!!!!  Stay until the end when they show who played who for it is one of those great movies where you just want to know what happened to all of the key players ....the ending will share their whereabouts.
All my best to under-dogs and animal lovers everywhere!!!

4321597,5,B004C03TK2,"I love horses, especially thoroughbreds, and Secretariat, whose nickname was ""Big Red"" was one of the very best.  This film does him justice.  Diane Lane, who portrays the owner of the horse and the stables, does an exquisite job in her role as gutsy stable owner and extraordinarily classy woman.  John Malkovich is perfect as Big Red's trainer, a very savvy misfit who finally gets his chance to find glory in the shape of a horse.  Now that I've seen the movie I can't imagine any other actors in those roles.  The photography of the races, including the closeups of the back end of a horse's hind legs and hooves filling the screen and throwing dirt at full speed, is amazing.  I knew Secretariat's story already, and I wondered if it was worth going to see a movie that just recounted that story over again, but wow! was it ever worth it.",1286323200,248,843,4.5131578947368425

4321600,5,B004C03TK2,"There are movies and there are great movies, and then, there's Secretariat.  Perfect cast; perfectly portrayed; amazingly told.  Penny Chenery is as much a part of the story as the horse.  I'm so grateful to Disney for creating this film and preserving this unique part of history that is a part of my life.  If you enjoy horse racing and history, then take a purposeful watch at ""the horse that GOD built!""  AWESOME MOVIE!",1527811200,,423,4.662162162162162

4321606,5,B004C03TK2,"Great movie about secretariat, with a few wrong historical items. Riva Ridge save the farm. Secretariat did bring in a lot of money which certainly helped. The brother and sister asked Penny to run the farm. In the movie Penny's husband was the bad guy when in reality she cheated on her husband for years with Lucian. Disney obviously did not use her adultery as the real reason for their problems and divorce.",1526947200,,411,4.6438356164383565

4321632,2,B004C03TK2,"As a review of this movie, I cannot endorse it. It portrays emotional reactions only of the ""haves"".There is no relevance to the real world.  It says nothing about the stress, subjugation and ""training"" of a fellow creature. This ""alternative person"" was subjected to the whims of ""human"" beings with their own agendas. I feel no empathy toward the ""humans"" involved with the ""triumphs"" of this radically abused fellow living creature. Thoroughbred racing is an abomination in my opinion.",1522281600,,488,5.177215189873418

4321637,5,B004C03TK2,"Secretariat (2010) tells the true story of a legendary horse, and his Triple Crown in 1973. Im usually not a big fan of Disney films, but this one enthralled me from beginning to end. The pacing, the acting, the music- its all here! I don't care for CGI, but I make an exception for this film, as some shots were simply too difficult to shoot otherwise. The blu ray is superb in picture and sound quality, and the bonus features are very interesting. Overall, Secretariat is a fine film that has replay value; I get more out of each viewing.",1521331200,,541,4.42

4321653,4,B004C03TK2,"I was thirteen years old when Secretariat was making history winning the triple crown.  And I vividly remember his winning the Belmont by 31 lengths.  After not having a triple crown winner in so long.  The 70s were probably the greatest decade of all time for horse racing with with three triple crown winners in five years.  Plus the greatest filly of all time in Ruffian.  Secretariat made the cover of Time Magazine.  As later did Diane Lane who played her owner.
The movie  tells the story of her as her Dad was the real owner of the horse farm but was failing in health.  So she took over the operations and won him by losing a coin flip.  And getting the horse she wanted anyway.  It caused some problems because she had to be away from her family for awhile.  But she didn't just take over the family business and studied horses.  Although I kind of had a hard time when they are washing the horse down while O Happy Day is playing in the sound track.
Any way you feel the emotion her owner is going through.  And the respect of her rivals it turns out she does know what she's doing. This is a stand up and cheer movie if there ever was one.",1518480000,,1150,4.244239631336406
4321654,5,B004C03TK2,"I am a horse girl, so this will forever go down as one of my favorite movies.

It is also great for non-horse people to see the historical significance of horse racing and some of the big business behind it. It gives a glimpse at some of our nation's past and how belief in something can change a nation. This is up there with Seabiscuit.",1518393600,,338,4.2

Talk about stupid....it was so inaccurate and so ""Disneyfied"", and was most certainly not the story of Secretariat....they just borrowed the name of a great horse and turned him into a backyard pony story.  The only reason I didn't walk out of the theater halfway through was because I'd paid for the popcorn.  The people weren't well portrayed at all....and ridiculous scenes like Mrs Tweedy and kids waving their arms and dancing around the horse while giving him a bath.....I'm not sure it could have been any dumber.

4321921,2,B004C03TK2,"We were very disappointed with this movie.  We were also unpleasantly surprised that Penny Chenery would allow this movie to be released.

From the beginning of the movie we were mystified how an ""impoverished"" Chenery family could afford the enormous expense of training and caring for Secretariat and still maintain the horse ranch.  After watching the movie, we researched the story and learned that the Chenerys owned another wonderful horse that came close to winning the 1972 Triple Crown, Riva Ridge.  It was Riva Ridge, Penny Chenery's favorite ""golden boy,"" whose earnings kept the Chenerys in the thoroughbred business.

The movie made no mention whatsoever of the crucial role Riva Ridge played in Secretariat's life with the Chenerys.

The movie depicted Lucien Laurin, Secretariat's trainer, as a bit of a golf-loving kook.  According to Ron Turcotte, Secretariat's jockey, Lucien was a very conservative, dedicated, very professional trainer.  Turcotte never remembers Lucien playing golf.

The worst treatment of all was the depiction of Sham's trainer, Pancho Martin, as a complete, unprofessional boor.  Anything I've ever read about Pancho described him as the consummate professional and gentleman, an everlasting credit to horse racing.  Ron Turcotte was so furious about Pancho's treatment in the movie, he vowed never to watch the movie again.  It was basically defamation.

Artistic license is one thing.  Defaming someone's person and professional contribution to a sport is dreadful.  Secretariat's legacy deserves much better than this movie.  We threw the dvd into the trash.",1480377600,2,1602,5.477551020408163

4321984,5,B004C03TK2,"A great movie for all ages!  I normally do not watch shows that star animals as I am too soft hearted.  Secretariat, however, was about more than an amazing horse.  The sister who ""took a risk"" and stepped away from a secure life with her husband to take a chance on something that she had long ago loved was inspiring.  The movie showed her connection with Secretariat without the tiresome ""horse whispered"" angle.  Just a woman who believed in herself, her abilities and her intuition about a horse.  I really enjoyed this movie and watching the big money world of horse racing was good.  Secretariat's performance at the Kentucky Derbyshire was and still is amazing and this was a beautifully crafted movie.",1474070400,,710,4.770491803278689

4322052,5,B004C03TK2,"I am biased of course having an OTTB that has the same bloodlines (Bold Ruler and Secratariat, multiple times).  Retired from racing.  Make sure and watch the youtube real races as well, full of drama and shows how far they went to be faithful to the story.  Note, there are two confusions that took years to sort out and they do not bore you with it in the movie.  In real life he one the Belmont by 24 lengths because it is a guess and hard to do with that much distance.  With photography and later analysis 31 lengths is the correct number (it will probably stand a long time).  In the movie they had the announcer just say 31 lengths ... not being in accurate, just getting rid of noise.  It is also true that his original Preakness time was not a track record.  The official clock was broken as it turned out.  The secondary clocks had the record time, and it was changed to the secondary clock times which is the record time.  But when he ran at Belmont officially he had only won the top time at the Derby.  As it turns out he beat the track records on all three tracks and won by the largest margin ever.  The Belmont time and 31 lengths are records that will take a long time to beat.  It is fun how the movie shows that these were real horse people, unlike many race horse owners now who own them to show off (like a trophy wife or fancy car).  Which is why there is a lot of abuse.  My horses one 6 figures for their owners and their payment when they were too old to race?  Starvation in crappy conditions.  Not to mention the abuse poured on them when racing (Secratariats jockey never used his whip at all in the winning Belmont, and rarely ever used it, and then lightly).  One of my horses was raced with baling wire instead of a bit ... hope I never meet the previous owner.  I got him at six and he recently passed at 28 on a nice pasture and still doing the occasional shorter rides.  There is a majesty to these horses and the movie shows it very well.",1467849600,4,1973,4.169312169312169

I was fortunate to live in the time of Secretariat's racing career and to have witnessed him becoming a Triple Crown winner.  The movie is very well done and is an excellent representation of the history of his life.

It's similarity in this respect to that other horse movie notwithstanding, who cares? They're both great. But I love this one a bit more because it's a woman. And she goes all in. She's not afraid. And Diane Ladd is one of the most underrated actors - I think it's because she doesn't look like she's trying. She's just inhabiting her character.",1454630400,,441,4.45679012345679

4322289,2,B004C03TK2,"The film is ok, but seemed to much like a Hallmark Movie of the Week and didn't have the epic-ness of Seabiscuit. Secretariat in real-life was a better horse then Seabiscuit and the problem is because he was so great he didn't experience the same tides of fortune, peaks and valleys of Seabiscuit, and thus the film lacks the drama Seabiscuit has. Its more about Diane Lane, and her story just wasn't that captivating dramatically speaking. Secretariat is a solid film, but nothing special.",1452211200,,490,4.845238095238095

4322312,5,B004C03TK2,"Secretariat is a story of having the heart of a champion--both his owner, and the horse. His owner finds herself taking over her father's horse farm, with a couple of fine mares about to foal, both sired by the same stud of strong blood lines. There is a hitch. The owner of the stud gets to flip a coin over which colt he gets. The stud owner chooses badly, and gets the lesser of the two colts. When the colt is 2 years old, he wins six straight races. Meanwhile, the estate is owing the government 6 million dollars, something they don't have. The only way to save her fathers horse ranch, is for the young horse, called ""Big Red"" and later named Secretariat, to win the triple crown. Anything less will cause them financial ruin.

This is a story of courage, and will make you feel good.",1448582400,,791,4.344594594594595

4322324,1,B004C03TK2,Historically inaccurate. Chenery's farm was not about to go belly up. They won the Derby and the Belmont with Riva Ridge a year before they won the triple with Secretariat. Even more disturbing Disney's portrayal of Sham's trainer Pancho Martin who was wrongfully vilified in a disgusting manner by director Randall Wallace. It was unfortunate that Martin had lived to see this shameful portrayal two years before he died.,1447372800,5,422,5.130434782608695

4322369,3,B004C03TK2,"This movie could have GREAT..  However:

I was extremely disappointed in Disney when I read reviews:  Jockey Ron Turcotte, who rode Secretariat to victory, said about Martin's portrayal: ""It wasn't that way.""

The portrayal of the human character's was not accurate...  There were important people missing (Penny had/has a sister) AND it wasn't the Secretariat's Triple Crown win that saved the Chenery family's farm, ""The Meadow"". It was Riva Ridge, who 'only' won the 1972 Derby and Belmont that truly 'saved the farm'.

Although it was a great story, the fact that Disney took such great lengths to entertain instead of tell the truth really bothers me...  That being said, I still watch it.",1443312000,,694,5.035087719298246

4322398,4,B004C03TK2,"In 1969, Penny Chenery (Diane Ladd), a Virginian by birth, is living in Denver, married to lawyer Jack Tweedy (Dylan Walsh) and the mother of fourtwo teenage daughters and two elementary-school sonswhen word comes that her mother has died.  Returning to the Thoroughbred farm where she grew up, she finds her father (Scott Glenn) sliding into dementia and her brother Hollis (Dylan Baker) talking about selling out.  But Pennys a horse lover, and she knows that two of the farms mares are in foal to Bold Ruler, a horse known for his speed but unable till now to sire anything with staying power, a gift she hopes the Chenery mares can provide.  When she learns that her fathers will includes a codicil leaving the disposition of the farm to Hollis but that of the horses to her, she knows she has the leverage she needsbecause what is a Thoroughbred farm without horses, and where are horses to live but on a farm?  Willy-nilly, Hollis and Jack must accept that Penny will run the farm even if it means missing out on much of her familys lives.

The following spring, one of the much-anticipated foals proves to be a chestnut colt whom everyone on the farm calls simply Red, but whose official name (after some wrangling with the racing authority) is Secretariat.  Though he loves to run, he loses his very first race, at age two, but with the subsequent help of French-Canadian trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) and his countryman jockey Ronnie Turcotte (Otto Thorwarth), he wins seven races in four months and is named Horse of the Year.  Although some believe that the longer races in which three-year-olds are entered will be his downfall, Penny and groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis) never lose their faith in him, and in 1973 he sweeps the Triple Crown, the first time any horse has done so in a quarter-centuryand sets records in each of the three races.

The pace of the movie is somewhat slow, but Pennys stubborn resolve and her evident love for her horse are inspiring for family viewing, and the race sequences are thrilling.",1441411200,2,2041,4.729577464788733

So an upbeat story has less appeal.  Good cast and great story and wonderful  visual effects. Also great 70s decor and clothes. Diane Lane and John Malkovich ( ok, probably  not spelled correctly) are  brilliant.  Good movie for kids with  good message about living your life with courage and dreams and loyalty. Racing scenes are compelling. Don't miss it.  Good watch for even people who don't care for horses. If you like horses, do not miss it.",1438819200,3,618,4.554545454545455

But I will never forget just watching him run with such grace and easy while the others were working so had to stay with him, Which they couldn't. I will never forget that horse! There will never be another like him, in my life time, that can match that 2:24 at the Belmont. Super horse! I enjoyed reading about the farm where he grew up.
I will always be grateful to my mom for insisting we watch all three races. She kept telling my brother and I ""You are watching history."" She was right! again lol!",1437868800,,598,4.163793103448276

4322588,5,B004C03TK2,"This is a wonderful and entertaining  movie about a great thoroughbred who defied critics' opinions that he was fast for a short distance but couldn't perform on the long track.  Diane Lane does a great job portraying Penny Chenery who also bucked the odds by sheer force of will and belief in her stallion, ""Big Red"".  John Malkovich who plays trainer Lucien Laurin does a fantastic job balancing his former cynicism of the trainers' world where he had a reputation as a loser with a mounting admiration of Chenery and the awesome ability of Secretariat.  The movie was billiantly cast. The filming of the race scenes puts this movie at the top of all horse racing movies.  It made me want to learn more about the real Secretariat and his Triple Crown triumph.",1434067200,,761,4.69172932330827
4322589,5,B004C03TK2,"After watching American Pharoah win the Triple Crown, I wanted to watch ""Secretariat"" again.  Now, I love horses so there is a bias.  But this is just a great ""feel good"" story about overcoming the odds while hanging in to the very end, not giving up, not quitting.  Since most people already know that he won the Triple Crown in 1973, I don't think I am giving away the end.  Secretariat was such a phenomenal race horse.  He set world records and track records for the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes.  His margin of victory at the Belmont (I won't give that away) was almost unbelievable and is still a track record.  It was such an amazing win, they have a bronze statue in his honor at Belmont.",1433980800,2,705,4.4186046511627906

Issues of her being a woman in a male dominated field are touched upon.

4322705,5,B004C03TK2,"I am very familiar with the story of Secretariat, who is regarded by historians and racing fans as one of the greatest pieces of horse flesh to ever grace a track; perhaps, because of historical significance and my previous knowledge of the industry, I felt like the script was watered down severely in order to accommodate younger and/or less-hardcore audiences.

Too many scenes, including the highly unnecessary conversation about the significance of winning the combined Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont stakes, should have been cut or re-shot. In addition, the somewhat clunky and predictable dialogue lessened the authenticity, particularly Diane Lane's unrealistic certainty, (borderline clairvoyance,) that her horse will win future races, with no shadow of a doubt.

In addition, many scenes felt like it was filmed for a non-ambitious, family film on ABC; on-track action scenes seemed like they had been captured by an iphone.

However, despite these problems, I truly felt inspired by Secretariat and Penny Chenery's gutsy endeavor to succeed. From the horse's vindicating win at Churchhill Downs to the unreal 30-length win at Belmont, filmmakers succeeded in the areas that mattered. I truly felt the excitement and magic of the sporting event; even though the simulated races were filmed exactly 40 years after actual events, I felt something authentically ""1973"" pull through and shine. And because this was the main point of the film, I can conclude that they succeeded nicely.

All that being said, I do love the horse and I like the movie. I have watched it a few times, but I have an obsession with all things horse :)",1430524800,3,1644,5.169172932330827

But, as usual, Disney screws everything up - the story is not anything like what actually happened, with so many impossibilities and so many ""edits"" to make the story ""better"" that all they did, in true Disney style, is take an already wonderful story and skewer it to make it a pretty movie with a syruppy story.

Diane Lane is excellent, as always, and she does a wonderful take on Ms. Penny, THE woman of horse racing. Horse racing scenes, even though you KNOW how it ends, STILL makes you clap and cheer. Otto T. as the jockey- well, you'll fall in love with him. Some scenes still makes me get tears.

WHY must they screw with the real true story? It is far better than Disney's portrayal.",1430438400,,827,4.227848101265823

It was a nice touch that Penny was included in the final race scene. The history represented in the movie is accurate even if it is sometimes uncomfortable.

He's going to kill the horse!"".........Everything was handled extremely well in the film...",1428451200,2,603,5.404255319148936
4322731,5,B004C03TK2,"This movie is thoroughly entertaining and, thankfully, has a happy ending to it. I've read reviewers' comments that it wasn't the way Secretariat's real-life story went, etc. But in my opinion, it captured the essence of the horse's life and racing experiences, and the people who were involved in helping to make him, what many believe, was the greatest race horse of all time.

The movie leaves you feeling very good, and aware of just how special this horse was. One of the most amazing things that keeps coming back to me is: in the Belmont Stakes, which was the longest track in the Triple Crown, Secretariat ran every quarter-mile faster than the preceding one! So on the final stretch, instead of running slower out of fatigue, he was running faster than at other point in the race. And that wasn't put in the movie for sensationalism -- that's what happened in real life, back in 1973. AND, Secretariat set a record time at Belmont that hasn't been broken to this day. One person remarked that it hasn't even been ""approached.""

Sure, there are parts in the movie that didn't happen in the real life story. But the movie does capture the essence of Secretariat's life, his greatness, and his owner's, trainer's, and exercise rider's relationship to him. And it does so in a BEAUTIFUL and JOYFUL way that will make you feel great having watched it.",1428451200,14,1355,4.713080168776371

They seem to feel that the film is very true to his ""real"" story.  As with ""Seabiscuit"", the story isn't so much about the horse as it is about the people who surround him.  Diane Lane is terrific as Secretariat's owner Penny Chenery, who is still alive.  Since ""Secretariat"" set speed records in the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness, and the Belmont - all in 1973 - no horse has broken those records.",1425081600,,520,4.681318681318682

4322929,4,B004C03TK2,"I love remembering the days of Secretariat and this was a nice movie. Must've been hard (impossible?) trying to find a horse for the part as even this fine horse didn't look like Big Red who could be quickly picked out from a herd. Thought they stayed to the events and used the calls from the track well.
Just an aside, Amazon Instant Video now charges tax on movie rentals? Sheesh! Talk about hard up for money. It says rent for $3.99 but no, that's not enough. Also Amazon has switched an aspect of the viewing format and the freeze frames are now grayed-over and written over so I can not enjoy freezing the pictures of the horses running. This will annoy me no end as I like to freeze and read whats on the screen in movies. ( I mean I bought a giant HDTV to see it..) So I'm cancelling my Prime membership effective immediately.
Enjoy the movie!",1415145600,,851,4.325

4322958,5,B004C03TK2,"This is not a true story of Secretariat, E.g., The year before Secretariat won the Triple Crown in 1973, his owner, Mrs. J. Tweedy had a horse, Riva Ridge, that won the Kentucky Derby in 1972, so when you put both horses on the track with Ron Turcotte riding both, it's really not much of a gamble of whom would win the Triple Crown. But it's a great movie for the whole family. Therefore, I'm quite happy to give this movie FIVE BIG STARS. If you would like to own a documentary of Secretariat, Amazon.com has ""THE LIFE AND TIMES OF SECRETARIAT AN AMERICAN LEGEND"" that I bought at Amazon.com and dearly love it. It too, I've rated five stars and watched it about 10 times. Enjoy!",1412553600,,681,4.3700787401574805

It starts out that she its a call from home saying that her mom has past. So they go home, home is a ranch that raises horses. Her father is in poor health. Before long she and her brother have to make the decision on what to do with their dad and the ranch. Her brother wants to sell the horse off, but she is wants to keep the ranch going. She does what ever she needs to. get the help that she needed to have this horse. She got this cranky old loud mouth to train this horse. He didn't know when to keep his mouth shut, so they made a pack with each other. He would tell the people how to handle this horse. What exercise to do and tell the rider what to do. This horse was the fastest racing horse ever. You will fine yourself yelling for the horse even in this  movie. Penny is an amazing woman and was an amazing woman back then.

One story is about the amazing and true events chronicling the rise of possibly the greatest race horse of all time.  There were challenges that the Secretariat Team (Horse + Trainers) rose above.  Amazing.  AND, the Second Story is that of the Feminist Movement making advaces and possibly arriving in the 70's.  Yes, the 70's.  That fomentive time.  These two stories were told to perfection in ""Secretetariat"".  This movie embodied the times (the 70's) as good as any film that I've ever seen.  If you want to know what the 70's was like, watch Secretariat.

The challenges of the daughter and her total determination and creative thinking that enabled her to let this unproven horse show what it could do.  Wow!!!!

It is one of the few movies that I enjoy more each time I see it. Although it is not a Christian movie, it has references to Job and the song Oh Happy Day, and I turn it up each time that song comes on! It is a very inspiring movie without being sappy or unbelievable.

Diane Lane does a terrific job bringing her character to life; makes me want to be a woman as strong and determined as Penny! The supporting cast is also excellently portrayed, and really makes the movie stand out.

4323078,5,B004C03TK2,"Mrs. Penny Chenery Tweedy, owner and manager of Secretariat, made some sagacious decisions that had a substantial impact on those closest to her. Both, her family and she were anguished during those times of separation. Penny had to leave her home in Denver to oversee the training and racing of this gifted colt. Her husband, Jack, pleaded with her to stay home and sell the horse, fearing that it would bankrupt them. A poignant scene in the movie is when the mother calls home to talk with her daughter, Kate. Penny calls to connect and catch up on how she is doing. Kate brushes her off, telling Penny that she is busy getting ready for a political march (parade) with her classmates from high school. After hanging-up, feeling dejected, Mrs. Tweedy breaks down weeping. Perhaps she felt regret and guilt for not being home to develop a closer relationship with her daughter. Some months later, the family, gathered around the television in Denver, watch the win at Churchill Downs. They then fly out to the east coast beaming with pride for their mom in a joyous reunion. To give you an idea of the significance of these events, Secretariat appears on the cover of Time magazine under the caption ""Super Horse."" If the Tweedys could turn back the hands of time and do anything differently, it's doubtful they would. The hardships and sacrifices they would endure all over again for the chance to experience the phenomenal success of this prodigious historical event.",1404864000,5,1471,4.841269841269841

I knew she liked horses, and most of the movies we had attended, over the previous year,  were of the space or time travel, action hero genre -my favorites.  I decided to let her have a break from those and felt she'd like this one and I'd bear through it.  Amazingly, we were both captivated by this film!  So, we just had to get the CD.  When there's not much going of TV, we pop in Secretariat and really enjoy this movie again.  Highly recommended for drama and excitement!",1402876800,3,561,4.235849056603773

4323113,5,B004C03TK2,"The movie is terrific: watch it for the splendid truth of Secretariat, the most magnificent horse ever to run under the silks and be thrilled either again or for the first time. Disney did a great job with the horse actors chosen to represent him: it looks like Big Red again! Ron Turcotte, Secretariat's jockey & true believer, is well represented in this film: it was Turcotte as much as Secretariat that made that Triple Crown, brilliant athletes both. Secretariat, Turcotte & groom Eddie Sweat are well & honestly represented in this film, there is truth to their stories.

The human storyline of Penny Tweedy & Lucien Laurin is an engaging fiction. Diane Lane does a great job playing a Penny Tweedy who might have existed in a parallel universe: the 'little housewife' fighting against the big ol' boys club of thoroughbred racing. The Penny of the movie who researches her bloodlines & believes in her red horse is a terrific story & one I enjoy with each watching although it is an utter fiction, as is the 'retired' Lucien Laurin, well-played by John Malkovich. Even though I well remember Secretariat, and his Meadows Stables predecessor in the Derby, Riva Ridge, and have read everything available, I still enjoy the lovely little make-believe of this movie.

Of course, the Belmont Stakes of 1973 was no make-believe: it was the most incredible horse race anyone has ever seen. The movie does it justice (you can also see it for yourself on youtube, in terrible '70s TV coverage!). And if you want the real story, by all means read William Nack's 'Secretariat' - it's the truth, and it's much, much better than any movie could ever be. The movie got that right: the man writes like a poet.",1402790400,11,1701,4.743243243243243

4323115,5,B004C03TK2,"This is definitely a Disney feel good movie about the greatest racehorse who ever lived and his humans who helped set the stage for his marvelous performances. The humans all did a very nice job, Diane Lane and John Malkovich, in particular. The producers found a very good horse to play Red as well. To focus on Secretariat, the full story, including Riva Ridge, had to be abridged, but that is of no consequence. The true story of 1973 is well captured, except the negative view of Pancho Martin. Hey, they needed a villain and it couldn't be Sham, Secretariat's half cousin and a great racer trapped in a bad year. This is a cut above the average Disney movie and their treatment of a legend is most enjoyable.",1402704000,,713,4.534883720930233

Horse movies are really not my thing.  Our 16 year old daughter is a women's rights advocate (she is upset that there are not enough females properly portrayed in video games).  Anyway, this movie was fantastic. It is inspiring, beautifully acted by Diane Lane, and just a joy to watch.  Everyone really enjoyed it (including my elderly parents, my wife and myself, and our 18 year old son and 16 year old daughter).  Just a nice family movie based on true events - and timely in light of the triple crown controversy of California Chrome.  No sex, no violence.  Highly recommended.",1402531200,,730,4.553846153846154

It is a fabulous movie for the entire family---no matter your age!  It is based on a true story, I believe it is easier for children to learn by visualizing history rather than being read to about it.  I have loved horses my entire life and can remember the races and this event.  I view it as giving my grandchildren a gift that hopefully keeps on giving and will say to their children, my Grandma saw this event.

So ""movie night"" came and there I sat playing with my Kindle fire, agreeing to sit with everyone, but clearly letting them know that I would not be partaking in this ""horse film.""  Happy to say, that only lasted about 3 seconds, from the very beginning I was captured - it's one of the most beautiful, engaging stories ever and it's not like it was fiction which made it even more exciting.  I have so much admiration and respect for those who were depicted within the movie as well as the actors themselves.

Without this moron as trainer secretariat could have been and should have been undefeated on the race track.  The heroine is too agressive and puts success in the world above a more important duty to her children and husband.  The man is a saint no question.

4323162,2,B004C03TK2,"As I watched this movie again the other day, for the first time since it came out on DVD, it amazed me how many things that were portrayed in this movie that DID not happen as portrayed.  Starting with Secretariats birth.  Mrs Tweedy was not there for his birth, nor was Lucien Laren.  Laren was too busy training horses to take time to see a colt be born.  They portrayed Secretariat as a calm horse who would stand there while his groom gave him a bath......ah...NOT!.  He was a stud colt, and if you have ever seen video of Secretariat while he was in training, he was constantly nipping and playing with his handler.  Any groom would NEVER have left a horse untied and without an assistant holding the horse.  Mrs Tweedy had no idea about Secretariat's breeding.  In the movie she describes Princequillo (who sired Big Red's mother) as his great grandsire.  He was Red's Grandsire.  They portray Red's father (Bold Ruler) or his offspring as incapable of winning past 1 mile.  He won numerous times at 1 1/8th and 1 1/4 miles.  They portrayed Sham's trainer as this Big broodish man who could not stand Secretariat.  Sham's trainer was a short man, who was a fan of Big Red.  He did not talk as disrespectful to Mrs Tweedy as he is shown doing in the movie.  I could go on for a while, but will end it with a review of the racing scenes.  THe Wood Memorial shows Red clearly finishing 3rd.....he barely got up for 3rd in the real race.  The Derby was done fairly well, and the Preakness was perfect as they used the actual 1973 Preakness video.  The Belmont was a disaster.  Not only was the race NOT filmed at Belmont, it was filmed in Kentucky at Keeneland Race Course.  Belmont race track is enormous.  Keeneland would fit inside its turf course, much less its outer dirt course.  The race call of the Belmont was a joke.  NEVER once did CHic Anderson say Secretariat won by 31 lengths.  The show Sham and Red together as they pass the 6 furlong marker.....By that time Red had left Sham 10 lengths behind him.  Chic Anderson says as Red hits the finish line that Secretariat hit the finish.....25 lengths in front......and he was guessing.  The final scene shows the whole crew standing on the track waving.  They show Mrs Tweedy's whole family there with the horse standing there calmly.  Again....not the way it happened.  Secretariat, after being photographed was on his way back to the barn.  He just ran 1 1/2 miles in a world record 2:24 flat.  He would not be able to stand ther quietly while everyone cheered.  This movie is 1/2 truth, and 1/2 Hollywood.  If you can stand the 1/2 Hollywood part, the movie is ok",1400544000,2,2628,4.5

If you were alive during that time, you'll remember the hysteria and build up to the Triple Crown running of the Belmont on June 9, 1973.  There will never be another horse to equal let alone surpass Secretariat and his time records. A MUST see movie for the entire family.
As a foot note.......
I can still remember sitting in the living room, wearing my wedding dress and waiting for the running of the Belmont. I would NOT leave for the Church before I saw the race.

4323220,3,B004C03TK2,"This was a fine, Saturday night family film (only one bad scene comes to mind with a couple very mild bad words, but otherwise harmless) about a housewife who becomes empowered to take over management of a race horse.  Film goes heavy on the ""Oh, you're just a housewife - then housewife shows them all and inspires her family at the same time"" cliche, and the film has plenty of cheese (like the obligatory characters listening to an oldies song and shaking their booties, etc) but ultimately it's the Rocky formula with a horse and everyone is cheering for the grand finale.  The acting was fine and the pacing good.  Only thing that seemed to be the hardest to grasp was Diane Lane's character being away from her family for so long, and how they managed realistically to balance the expenses of all the travel back and fourth, and how the family managed to stay together through something like that.  At times, Lane's character would be so caught up in the horse business I was left wondering, repeatedly, ""So, what's on going on back with her family?"" and then inevitably there'd be an obligatory ""phone call and crying"" sequence to bridge back, but I dunno, I just didn't feel that was balanced well.

4323253,5,B004C03TK2,"''He could do everything,'' trainer Lucien Laurin once said of Big Red who died in 1989 at age 19,  ''There was never a horse like him.''

It is possible that Big Red's outsized devoted heart was an important ingredient into that unstoppable trust-winning attitude he possessed during all his life as a racing horse?  Also Big Red's owner Penny Chenery (still around at 91 years young) was in an especially subtle manner connected with his heart that was revealed its size was, at twenty-two pounds compare to an average eight pounds for regular racing stallions, one of the largest ever of a racing horse.

Since the name Secretariat is more suitable for a mare than for a steed like Big Red, as those who closely knew him called him, would have been the appropriate name for that superb and elegant racer. No one who knew the champ, they say, called him Secretariat.

The number three appears to be connected to Big Red:  Laurin gave a cake to Secretariat on the colt's 3rd birthday in 1973, the year of their Triple Crown; born in 1970 he was THREE years young in 1973 of their TRIPLE Crown.  Eight is the symbol of reality or immortality but, in its shape 3 is half of an 8.  Most probably Big Red will complete the eight, for full success, in his next time around.

 This is a well-crafted movie based on one the best and most successful stallion that ever graced a racetrack.

Highly recommended",1390694400,3,1401,4.564

In my opinion, the only way to appreciate the races, particularly the last one, is to see them on the big screen. The scene of Secretariat racing in heart-pounding, historical triumph to the finish line in the Belmont Stakes...well, the impact is incredible.  Forget that you already know the story.  In those last moments, for a mere instant, the thought crosses your mind that Secretariat could literally drop dead on the race track from going so fast.  But then, ""Oh, Happy Day"", you realize that this horse was BLESSED, beyond all reason & genetics, with a heart so BIG so as to create a glorious moment of greatness, forever frozen in time. The moment when a horse flew without wings as close to the heavens as any ever would.",1387152000,,841,4.5131578947368425

The only scene parents of small children should be aware of is a comedic scene with John Malkovic in which he says, ""He couldn't train a monkey to pick his own butt."" For some this will be no big deal, but I know for some children it could result in continuous repeat. At a younger age at least one of my children would have been in the latter category. After this scene, we made sure to reinforce the expectation of polite language and of not repeating the line, no matter how funny it was in context.

As for overall message, it was good. Never give up. Also nice to see was the strong female character portrayed by Diane Lane. She was smart, decisive, and held her vision, while being open and supportive of her children.",1380412800,,803,4.3533333333333335

I found it hard to  bond with the characters.  I think the lack of story made it nearly impossible to make a good film and the attempt to make things interesting just didn't suit me. Not a lot of characters to like in the film, none memorable.  I found myself skipping forward more and more and just gave up.  I think if they had concentrated on the grace and beauty of horse racing (Secretariat's spectacular career was so short that there weren't any real ups and downs to make a compelling story)  it would have been a much better film, similar to how they did the film Gran Prix in the 60's, it would have been much better.",1377129600,2,830,4.357142857142857

I owed the children a reward and they requested a movie and popcorn. This was my way of letting them relax but also giving them a story with local and historical significance. This was a terrific tale that held the attention of a room of video game loving ten year olds...not an easy task. Completely appropriate for all ages...no cursing or inappropriate situations.

John Malkovich was kind of an unconvincing trainer, although he wore some sweet fedoras and sport coats in the movie. The plot itself was not very captivating and the drama to the story line was glaringly manufactured. It was a rather poor produced movie and I prefer Seabiscuit much more than this one. Which is unfortunate, because Secretariat was a tremendous horse/athlete and his owner Penny Chenery was a great and strong woman, especially for that era.

Also, the entire cast seemed well chosen with performances by other familiar actors with much smaller roles (e.g. Cromwell, Walsh, Baker, Thompson,etc.)

Disney has a habit of sugarcoating biographies and history which is the reason why I struggle to give this movie five starts. I think there could have been a bit more of an edgier feel when it came to portraying the turbulence that Penny's marriage and family life endured as she devoted so much time to training a champion horse.

Penny Chenery Tweety (Diane Lane) is devestated by the loss of her mother, and even more upset when she learns that her family's horse farm is in trouble. She has fond memories of her life there as a child and she knows how important the success of their horses is to her ailing father (Scott Glenn). Her husband and her brother are not thrilled when Penny unexpectedly takes up the reins of the family business, gambling all of their futures on an unborn colt. When Secretariat is born he steals Penny's heart and she spends the next 3 years of her life working with trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich), groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis) and her father's secretary Miss Ham (Margo Martindale) building him into the champion racehorse she knows he can be. We're as much rooting for Penny to hold her family together as we are for Secretariat to win each race as we walk with her in this journey from housewife to horse owner extraordinairre. Secretariat was and is the star of the show, a horse who broke records and trampled expectations and who possessed every bit as much heart as his beloved owner.

4323435,4,B004C03TK2,"Secretariat (Randall Wallace, 2010)

I will tell you right now--because I have a suspicion that I'm going to end up focusing on a couple of things about Secretariat that really, really annoyed me--that I enjoyed this movie immensely. I recommend it to everyone, even people who don't like horse racing (especially, actually, people who don't like horse racing). But I recommend it with the caveat that once you're done watching it, I will equally strongly recommend you go read William Nack's Secretariat: The Making of a Champion, the book that ""suggested"" Mike Rich's script--because they're you're going to get all the stuff that this movie leaves out--notably, the second half of the horse's career, which was arguably more impressive than the first half depicted here.

In case you're not up on your horse racing history, the plot: a horse is born. Outspoken owner Penny Chenery (Lady Beware's Diane Lane), who has recently taken over her dying father's racing and breeding business and is now trying to make headway into a traditionally male-dominated society (after all, they do call it the Sport of Kings, right?), realizes she's got something special, and after some wrangling, she assembles what ends up--in the movie, anyway--being the perfect team to turn that something special into a superstar: trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich), groom Eddie Sweat (The Help's Nelsan Ellis), and jockey Ron Turcotte (actual jockey Otto Thorwarth in, to date, his only screen appearance). Penny fights the Boys' Club, the horse fights on the track, and we all get to the Triple Crown.

Yes, it's a loose adaptation. I was mostly okay with that, though Hollywood once again takes the easy way out and leans on the Triple Crown as the Arbiter of All That Is Great in Horse Racing, rather than attempting to explain, for example, that Secrtariat's final career race, in the Canadian International at Woodbine, cemented his place in history just as much as his run in the Belmont did. (Because, you know, doing that would require making audience members who are less familiar with horse racing actually learn something, and we can't have that, now, can we?) Getting butts in seats for historical dramas usually requires at least a little tweaking, to play up the parts of the story that modern viewers will find more relevant--in this case, The Woman Fighting for Equal Rights in a Man's World(TM). And that's not necessarily a bad thing, though it does tend to cast an undeserved light on American racing's elite, who, while undeniably sexist (Americans, more than any other racing country in the world, believe that ""the fillies can't run with the boys"", which is why America cards so many more races restricted to fillies and mares per capita than any other country--though that it changing, and it's going the wrong way), have always been more interested in the color of one's money than the direction of one's plumbing, as it were. But I don't think most two-buck bettors are going to complain at any movie that takes a bunch of swipes at Bull Hancock, gruffly played by Fred Dalton Thompson, or Ogden Phipps (James Cromwell), or any of the other ultra-wealthy types. After all, they've never gone around picking up tickets off the grandstand floor looking for something they can cash.

But it does bring up the question in my head--why do you feel the need to (over-)dramatize a story, Hollywood, that's already dramatic? It's impossible for any horse fan to listen to Chic Anderson's call of the Belmont and not tear up a little. And unlike, say, Seattle Slew, who went into the Triple Crown undefeated, Secretariat wasn't perfect. It wasn't a question of waiting for the inevitable loss (some horses do retire undefeated, natch, but they are few and far between), but even when it looked like he overwhelmed everything else, you knew there was always an Onion or a Prove Out who might suddenly pop up and remind you that this horse was mortal. Point being, you could simply tell the story and come up with a good movie. Maybe even a better one than this, though I say again, as I said at the beginning, I liked this one well enough. But there was room for improvement. *** ",1365465600,,4178,4.878873239436619

I really liked the character development in the movie and feel it was superbly done.  I still get goosebumps when watching the final race scene even though I know what is going to happen and have now seen the movie a few times.

My wife and kids who are not interested in horse racing at all did not want to watch the movie with me, but one family night I was able to convince them to watch it and every one of them were leaning forward during that final race scene and they were cheering as if it were really happening.  After the movie they were asking me questions about if this really happened.  Even my wife was impressed and interested.  My oldest daughter and I went online to show her what ""Big Red"" really looked like and do a little more research.  It was a nice family bonding experience.

If you like horse racing and want to see a wonderful story... you really should see this movie.  If you just want to see a well done feel good movie.... you really should see this movie.

She told me later that she was just doing an elbow hook as a chummy-friendly way of getting warm because it was a cold night.

I have reviewed footage of the real Secretariat and it is mind boggling at the strength and the stamina this athlete showed when presented with the chance. This horse love the challenge of coming from behind to win a race, and did it without being prodded...As for the owner, Mrs. Tweedy was incredibly confident for a women in this genre of athleticism. A statement made ""she took on the old boys and won"" was exactly what happened. Her own husband doubted her ability to handle her father's business and win the way she did. Her belief in the horse's ability to do its job formed a bond between horse and owner that surpassed any form of trust known to man. I believe the horse ran not only because it loved to run, but because Mrs. Tweedy acknowledged the horse for who it was, like a mother to a child......Very good movie and the product was in good shape....for that fact I still watch the movie......love it to death",1360800000,,1054,4.466321243523316

The roles were well played and I especially liked how the story of Penny and husband reflected how women were growing in businesses.  Her husbands initial comments and jealousy in the beginning of the film reflected how it was in the late 60s, early 70s.  My how things have changed.  In today's politically correct world though, I can't help but wonder if Secretariat would have been disqualified simply because his heart was bigger than most.

It is a feel good movie that the whole family can watch together. No nudity. No violence. No filthy language. No special effect explosions.  Just a beautiful story about a magnificant horse and a woman who was derided as being ""just a housewife"" who had faith that her horse had what it takes to be a winner. Of course, everyone knows the story of Secretariat but that does not diminish the enjoyment I got from this film. Some witty dialog ... as Secretariat was winning the Belmont by 31 lengths the trainer implored the jockey not to fall off.(A sad prophecy in that Ron Turcott was later involved in a fall that injured his spine and ended his career) My only complaint about the movie is that there could be so much more footage of the horse and its early training. The movie had barely begun and Secretariat was already being entered in the two year old races and was suddenly horse of the year. Then, it ended right after the Belmont rather than continuing through the end of the year to when he was retired to stud. Overall, however, a well done movie that I could recommend to anyone.",1346284800,,1222,4.359649122807017

The acting is good and the characters are very believable -- it is based on a true story.  I have watched this movie at least 25 times and never get tired of it.  For several months the movie was available on the cable channels and On Demand and I watched it consistently.  But when they stopped showing it I realized that I needed to get my own copy.

Why did it take so long for someone to make a move about this magnificent horse?  Considering the quality of this movie, they should have waited longer. This movie was not about the horse but his owner.  Secretariat was, and is, exciting enough for the entire plot.  Why dilute the plot with the owner's ""story""?

It was poorly edited.  The plot was sort of slowly moving along and suddenly Secretariat was being called the wonder horse.  There was certainly nothing in the movie that justified that title at this point in the movie.

Even the cinematography was poor to average.

I agree with most of the oomments made by the 1-star and 2-star reviewers.  And did trainers and grooms of high priced thououghbreds really use hay nets?

Well, if you don't know anything about Secretariat, you could easily look at the cover and see a picture of a horse and a Disney logo and politely decline. Thankfully, I at least knew Secretariat was real, and I thought I'd give it a try. I was blown away! The acting is good, the photography is good, it's clean and family-appropriate, and the story? Hmmm...I better leave the story for you to watch!

Seriously, now one of my top ten favorite movies, this is the classic Disney treatment to a real-life sports fairytale (comparisons:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rookie-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000068DBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rookie (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Greatest-Game-Ever-Played/dp/B000CNFC76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Greatest Game Ever Played</a>).

4323555,4,B004C03TK2,"When I got this DVD as a present, I was not thrilled.  The initial press reviews I read were tepid or downright scathing.  As a long time horse owner and rider (and generally horse crazy person) but not a fan of horse racing, I was familiar with the story of Secretariat and remember watching the live coverage of his Triple Crown races at the time, so my expectations for this DVD were low.  To my surprise, I found myself getting fairly swept along by the movie and really enjoyed the pace and treatment of the horse racing action, and the characterization of the various main players.  Diane Lane gave a fine performance while John Malkovich was brilliant and funny.

I agree with some of the criticism:  even overlooking the many liberties they took with the real events, the movie is really all about Penny Chenery and her determination to see this special foal run and prove himself.  She had many obstacles to overcome but too much is made of her ""housewife"" state, after all she was born and raised on a training farm.

Secretariat was truly a super-horse (his heart was twice the size of that of an average horse and some of his records still stand after 37 years) but neither his physical and mental gifts nor his unmatched dominance of the sport were sufficiently conveyed.  Instead, his remarkable string of victories is presented more like a vaguely mystical journey with religious overtones.  In fact, the coverage of the Belmont race is the weakest moment in the whole film, ludicrously interrupted by gospel music and shoddily re-enacted on a much smaller racecourse.  It would have been much better to show the actual footage of the race which still stands as one of the greatest moments in any sport.  Finally, the hippy daughter fabrication further detracted from the action, making Secretariat himself too much of a bit player.

Despite all of the above, my family enjoyed this movie so much that we have already watched it a second time and I suspect it will get further airings from time to time.",1342224000,,2018,4.715099715099715

I have to turn my TV nearly as loud as it will go just to get normal sound. I'm sure devoted racing fans would find things to criticize because of the way the races were run (jockeys standing up in the stirrups early to be sure the right horse won, etc.), but it was exciting, the horses were beautiful, and it was a good story. I would recommend it to anyone who likes any of those things.",1341619200,2,674,4.1923076923076925

The people who insulted the Disney version probably never saw Big Red run the Belmont in the first place.  This movie is wonderful, for those of us who saw him make his amazing run.  If you missed it, cause you were too young or too  stupid to watch, please don't diss the movie which is very good.

`Secretariat' isn't among the best in the long line of movies about racetracks and horses and the people who run them. That's saying a lot, since it's got the best story of them all, at least given its protagonist, the near-miraculous Secretariat, and it's clearly among the best-funded film ever about horses and racetracks. It also has the benefit of some very solid casting, including Diane Lane, a fine actress who's a dream to watch, and John Malkovich, from the very top drawer. Despite its Disney roots, a weak script and indifferent direction hamper this movie with one-dimensional characters and low production standards.

The weakest link is some very feeble characterizations. In one of its best scenes, the Lane character's main adversary is too easily bested by her in a public forum where their repartee comes closest to sparkling. That rival is otherwise confined to growling and shaking his fist at her from a distance, and yet he is the nearest thing in this film to a colorful secondary character of interest. No-one thought to include more of them, to lend some panache to this movie: no cigar-chomping Roscoes worrying over a racing form; no sweaty gamblers being henpecked in the stands by blowsy broads; no allowance-risking teens playing hooky for a taste of the track. Nada. A smart-alecky jockey might have added spice, as would giving the stable-boy more than just two or three lines - at least two of which he addresses to the horse!

With such a top-flight cast even this might have been okay had the leads been put to better use. But the script is limp almost throughout, characterizing the protagonists through trite observations. The Malkovich character's inept golfing and garish outfits are subject to some ribbing - although nobody flinches when at least once he inexplicably appears in something quite stylish. Also, the dialogue between Lane and her hippie daughter too often involves heartfelt compliments about each other's good looks. Yawn.

We're told that this daughter's youthful activism mirrors her mother's strength of spirit, but this goes no farther, hardly helping to develop either character. In another lurking subplot, or so it might seem, the protagonist lives away from her husband but with a rather masculine woman who happens to elicit some of her warmest smiles, and at least once even embraces her consolingly. But if you begin to reckon that something will emerge from this, think again: it, too, adds up to nothing (...maybe in the book?).

Again, not much is striking in the art direction. Costumes and settings for this presumably early 1970s story are okay but don't stand out. The DVD's added features focus on how the racing was filmed from up close, deftly from a hanging camera, from the jockey's viewpoint, etc. Crafty, but nothing in this film quite conveys the exoticism of racetracks, which are elegant places where fortunes are hopefully made and lives are often broken - and this story is, precisely, about a big gamble. Interest could have been ratcheted up with a hand-held sweep through some echoing grand hall, especially of action at a racetrack's betting wickets, to show these near-mythical venues' excitement and atmosphere. But this last is what this production most lacks. In fact, like Lane's oddly frequent telephoned interactions with both husband and daughter, most of the racetrack scenes were probably filmed in a studio. Sadly, it shows.

I mean every time.

I called my girlfriend and briefly discussed the film with her.  A major stoic, she said that she cries too and I asked her why?  Before she had an opportunity to respond I said ""Perhaps it's because we witness something perfect of heroic proportions doing something it was designed by God to do flawlessly with all of its heart and being.""

4323578,1,B004C03TK2,"This paean to selfishness and narcissism is a new low for a company that presents itself as a purveyor of family entertainment. The central character, Penny Tweedy, is a self-absorbed ""sportswoman"" (read ""spoiled rich girl"") who forsakes everything, including her children, in a desperate grab at notoriety after inheriting the greatest racehorse in history. Tweedy may not be the monster that Disney paints her to be in this picture, but the fact that Disney would come up with such an ugly script is stomach-turning.
This movie follows much the same formula as the Disney film ""Miracle"" about the 1980 US Olympic hockey team, but here the drama is fabricated, unlike the reality behind Team USA's incredible victory which had real suspense. And there's really very little to like about the world of horse-racing, which is a grimy business, not a sport. Disney did do a good job of depicting that side of the racing world, but fell flat on its face when it tried to elicit some sympathy for the Tweedy character with absurd scenes like the ones where she sheds a tear while she waits for race results half a continent away from where the golden moments of her children's lives are passing without her presence. This is the ultimate yuppie movie with a central character who cares more about her own self-gratification than she does about anything else, including her family.

4323580,5,B004C03TK2,"If you were alive and paying attention to the Triple Crown in 1973, you've never forgotten those races, especially the Belmont Stakes, where we saw a horse run away from his contemporaries like no horse has ever done in a major race. The call as Secretariat entered the final turn ""Secretariat is moving like a tremendous machine"" will live through the ages, and was phenomenally accurate to boot.

I'm not as familiar with the behind the scenes story of the horse, the owners, the stable, or the trainer as some might be. Therefore I can't testify to the accuracy or lack thereof of that part of the story. I wouldn't expect it to be overwhelmingly accurate. If it were then this would be the first movie to strictly adhere to the facts. LOL And you have to give the film makers some leeway. They're making a movie about a series of races for which the results are widely known. Yet they have to find a way to inject some drama and suspense into the story. Otherwise you might just as well catch a rerun of ESPN's Sports Century show about the 1973 Triple Crown and Secretariat. LOL

While the movie makes an interesting possible fiction about the behind the scenes spunk of those responsible for Secretariat, the meat of the film is the coverage of the Triple Crown, and there the movie shines.

In the Kentucky Derby coverage, a bit much is made of Secretariat trailing the field. Watching a replay of the race, it appears that Secretariat was only third from the trailing horse. The rest of the race is presented quite accurately, using the transcript of the actual race call, if not word for word then pretty close to it.

For the Preakness, a bit of drama was introduced. Here Secretariat indeed trailed the field at the beginning of the first turn, but turned it on quickly to move to the front on the backstretch. The movie pads the length of time before Secretariat moved up and took the lead for dramatic effect, but again essentially the original racing call is used. Interestingly, this race is presented with the owner's family watching on TV, and I assume uses the actual taped TV footage.

There was little drama whatsoever in the Belmont Stakes, and the movie faithfully portrays this race with one exception. In the movie they have Sham even with Secretariat at 1:09 into the race. Actually, at that point the Triple Crown winner had already accelerated for a three to four length lead and was continually pulling away from the rest of the field, eventually winning by an unheard of 31 lengths, and setting a track record which stands to this day. The movie succeeds in that the emotion of that event was recaptured in the film. At Belmont on June 9th 1973, people wept in the stands as Secretariat destroyed the field and won going away. It is quite emotional in the film too. I felt myself a bit choked up, to the point where my voice cracked as I made a comment about the film to my wife at that point.

It's not the film makers we judge or think to celebrate here. It is our memories of a great athlete, even if that athlete was a horse. Millions had great affection for Secretariat, and the film recaptures that feeling for all of us who lived it. The back story glues the film together. The Triple Crown races make the film outstanding.",1331510400,,3259,4.543441226575809

One cannot help but root for Secretariat to win because all of the stories of the people involved become so alive in the film.  The acting is not stellar, actually sort of mediocre.

This Disney movie has taken everything
From the '50s tv sitcoms that is superficial and bad and funneled them here. Anything that might have been interesting or imaginative about a character was washed off at the site of the script. Penny Tweedy is the bland, inappropriately smiling leave it to Beaver's mother, but worse, completely without realness. Her wig, for one thing, never varies, over years. No hair gets out of place.
And where does 'Oh Happy Day (When Jesus Washed My Sins Away') come in? It has no relevance to anything in the story, and, in fact, seems a tad blasphemous when it is loudly played over secretariat's main win.

So much in this film is nauseatingly hackneyed.

Is this the director, or a committee, cynically throwing bones at different 1990s communities? ('90s, not 21st century educated tastes and sensibilities).

So much is disconnected, as if there was little or no time for rehearsal, or for the director to bring all the actors together and get them on board, tell them the story. Characters have cameos, aren't integrated into the story or into their own roles. What about James Cameron's part? We don't know him; he has no substance.

What about Malkovich's failed golf practice? That was slapstick and botched; we knew where that scene was going all the time.
(Malkovich speaks French at times throughout the film;
 But there are no subtitles to tell us what he's mumbling!) We knew where the whole thing was going all the time. And there was no interesting character or piece of acting to give us a reason for being there. I fell asleep twice, and struggled, hopefully, to get through to the end. But nothing got better.

The movie shows how the trainer and jockey are selected. The story is about the races, but does a good job with the background stories about the race. The races are exciting even when you know the outcome.

Diane Lane does a great job as the owner. Malkovich is very good as the trainer. The family is ok. I thought they could have done more with the family issues, but it works.

I'd also seen Riva Ridge -- owned by Meadow Stable, trained by Lucien Lauren and ridden by Ron Turcotte -- win the Derby the previous year. Meadow Stable had a lot of big-name horses. After Secretariat lost the Wood Memorial, Mrs. Tweedy was quoted as saying she should have entered Upper Case (a speed horse from Meadow Stable) in the race instead of or along with Secretariat. If the stable was in such a corner financially as portrayed in the movie, it would have been entering horses in high-paying stakes races left and right rather than thinking the only option was selling its bellcow. But even knowing all this, I enjoyed the movie as fictional entertainment with some facts thrown in. And Secretariat certainly changed the sports scene in America by becoming the first triple crown winner in a quarter century, returning horse racing to the headlines, at least for a while, with Seattle Slew following up with another triple crown win the following year and the Foolish Pleasure/Ruffian match race a couple of years later keeping the Sport of Kings on the cover pages of sports sections nationwide.",1324166400,,1231,4.894736842105263

She was impressive also in her conduct, her beliefs and her stamina to be a winner. There are bias's for women in most fields and she did not allow that to stop her. She knew and had faith in her horses and from that standpoint the movie succeeds at getting that across to the audience or at least to me.

If that kind of thing bothers you, be prepared for it - they ""enhanced"" some characters and add-libed a few things, as well as deleting others (like Riva Ridge).  If you think you can get over that, it's a nice feel good movie.  I enjoyed the portrayal of Penny - after all she did do a lot for being ""just a house wife"" and I am sure that it took some perseverance on her part (I loved the scene in the all male club, whether it really happened or not!).  It may have been a bit over done, but I am sucker for strong female characters.  I also liked the cursory covering of his lineage; while cursory it was nice to at least see it mentioned, as many movies like this ignore it or gloss over it completely.  I also thought they handled the syndication well.

The ending of this movie also felt very anticlimactic; he won the last race and it pretty much ended.  I was expecting either a flash to the future to cover his death, or at least some mention of his breeding record and death.  After all, they did info blips on the people, why not the horse....the movie was about him!

4323629,2,B004C03TK2,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Despite being an inveterate horse player, I had some trepidation as to whether 'Secretariat' was going to turn out to be a good film. Just how many horse races can you show before the story begins to feel repetitious? No matter how great Secretariat was as a race horse, a story of this sort (to be successful) must ultimately focus on the external conflict between the human players as well as the internal arc of the protagonist.

The protagonist here is Penny Chenery, a Denver housewife, who arrives at her childhood home in Virginia, following the death of her mother. Her 'home' is actually Meadow Stables, owned by her father, Christopher, now stricken with dementia and is almost completely unaware of his surroundings. In real life, Penny's father was never at the farm at the time of his wife's death, having been hospitalized for five straight years in a hospital in New Rochelle, N.Y., until his death in 1973. The film's scenarist wasn't lying when it's made clear in the credits that the events in the film are ""suggested by"" and not ""based on"" the book 'Secretariat: The Making of a Champion'.

Despite playing loose with the facts, the opening 'funeral' scene is effective as it conveys Penny Chenery's heart-felt grief over the death of her mother. There are more interesting scenes in the first half of 'Secretariat'. In perhaps the best scene in the film, after deciding to take over the reins at Meadow Stables, Penny confronts and fires a dishonest trainer who attempted to sell some of the stables' horses at a lower price than they were worth, before being stopped by Penny's mother. Equally as interesting is the famous 'coin toss' scene where leading owner Ogden Phipps gains the right to breed one of Penny's two mares with his best stallion, Bold Ruler.

'Secretariat' begins to lose steam when we're introduced to John Malkovich who plays Lucien Laurin, hired by Penny to be Secretariat's trainer. The sarcastic Malkovich is completely miscast as Laurin, who according to Secretariat's real-life jockey, Ron Turcotte, never wore flashy clothes, played golf or was a ""goofball"". Worse than that, the film implies that Meadow Stables had lost profitability by the time Secretariat was about to win the Triple Crown. In actuality, Roger Laurin, Lucien's son, was hired in 1969 and returned the farm to profitability by cutting costs. After he left to the Phipps farm, Lucien came on board and in 1972, trained Riva Ridge to win both the Kenturcky Derby and Belmont States. So it's not convincing that Lucien was 'down and out' at the time Penny asked him to become Secretariat's trainer. Nor am I convinced that Meadow Stables was also 'down and out', especially after Riva Ridge was so successful in 1972. We're asked to believe that Penny is forced to syndicate Secretariat's breeding rights to save the farm but I suspect it was simply a shrewd, business move.

Further dragging 'Secretariat' down are the hokey family scenes which includes some minor conflict that goes nowhere between one of Penny's daughters who happens to be playing an anti-war activist in school. And what of Penny's husband? He's shown siding with Penny's brother about selling the farm and it's implied that the couple had some kind of falling out. In actuality, Penny divorced her husband and that's never shown in the film at all. As in most Disney films, the less unpleasantness, the better!

The second half of the film begins with Secretariat's first race as a two year old, which is not seen on screen. After the race, trainer Laurin explains to Penny that he simply ""wasn't ready"". It's also implied that Secretariat won the rest of his races as a two year old. The film leaves out the fact that Secretariat was disqualified in the Champagne Stakes and placed second. Although Secretariat runs third in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, this time he has an excuse: an abscess is found in his mouth.

Director Randall serves up a series of ho-hum racing scenes to illustrate Secretariat's triumph in winning the Triple Crown. The most glaring fault of his Derby recreation, is filming the Triple Crown infields at small Evangeline Downs in Louisiana. Wisely, he utilized the actual race for the Preakness by having Penny's family watch it on a TV screen, thus cutting down on the repetitiousness of all the racing scenes. Randall employs all wrong Gospel music during Secretariat's stretch run during the Belmont Stakes as well as allowing all kinds of bloopers to creep in (for example, during the Belmont Stakes, the long shots show Secretariat alone increasing his lead, yet, on a couple of close-ups another horse can be seen running next to him.)

The weak second half also features a weak antagonist in the guise of trainer Pancho Martin who bad mouths Penny during the Triple Crown news conference. According to Ron Turcotte, Martin actually was a decent guy and doesn't deserve the vituperative treatment depicted here.

I wonder if Secretariat can really be considered the greatest horse of all time. When Citation won the Triple Crown in 1948, television was in its infancy and he simply did not not have the advantage of all the media hype which Secretariat did. Consider that Secretariat won 16 of 21, never finishing below fourth as a three year old but Citation won 27 out of 29, with two seconds and raced after he was a three year old (unlike Secretariat).

As a basic by the numbers introduction to Secretariat, the film certainly does its job and one can't argue with Diane Lane's fine performance as Penny Chenery. But ultimately the film never reproduces the excitement one felt viewing the Triple Crown races back in 1973.",1317427200,5,5691,4.881987577639752

Diane Lane's prodigious beauty and talent are on full display as Penny Chenery, Secretariat's owner, and John Malcovich also shines in his role as trainer. The opening ode to the horse, taken from the Bible's book of Job, is inspirational. An early sequence involving Malkovich is hilarious, and one any golfer will relate to.

In the final analysis, Secretariat surprised me. It surprised me because it proves that Hollywood is still capable of making a movie for ""the rest of us,"" and by that I mean a movie that doesn't contain Hollywood's usual heavy doses of graphic violence and sex, profanity, and liberal-progressive ideology. In short, Secretariat is a very welcome, although much too rare, breath of fresh air.

Have now lost count of how many times we've watched it. Characterization is great. Story, inspiring. Photography of the racing, fantastic (you lose some of its impact on a TV screen, unfortunately). There are a number of memorable lines for anyone going through challenging times.

Any dog lover will recognize the intense unspoken communication between her and her horse.

This isn't your father's Disney movie. there is a back story of a working mom and entrepreneur, a horse lover, and a failing ranch. Secretariat is as much a star of this movie as is Diane Lane.

But that film was made quite a while back at this point, but also had a huge bestselling non-fiction book behind it, and the movie version was fit with a perfect cast. Unfortunately, cast-wise, I think john Malkovich is well past his good-by date, and Ms. Lane doesn't do much here, either.
Sadly, and importantly, this film doesn't capture at all the atmosphere of the early 1970s. TCM recently played ""Junior Bonner"", made in 1972; perhaps these filmmakers should have checked out that movie for some reference, as that Sam Peckinpah film perfectly captured the feel and texture of it's own time, at least of it's region (which is the exact same period of ""Secretariat"").
Also on the down side, this picture includes that typical post-""The Natural"" brand of corny, poorly composed background music which is supposed to tug at the heart, but which is really just bombastic puffery. In addition, the few pop songs which are added for ""period"" flavor, seem to have been chosen for the ears of TODAY's audiences in mind (and what today's youth think we were all listening to), but are completely out of sync with what adults of the day would have commonly been entertained by (even though ""I'll Take You There"" indeed was a #1 Billboard hit in 1972; but again this was certainly not the kind of song middle agers would have paid any attention to, or almost anyone over 25 even have been aware of, as shown in the film...this of course smacks of just trying to market the soundtrack to a modern audience, or of youthful ignorance by the movie's producers).

4323647,1,B004C03TK2,"Well,except for the remake of ""Flicka"" this is by far the worst horse racing movie I ever sat through, my mouth hanging open in disbelief!

First of all the hideous acting. Diane Lane basically called this one in, mostly standing there with that dumb half-smile. John Malkovich- basically mumbled all the way through, couldn't understand most of what he said. The Tweedy family were mostly cliched cut-outs standing around.

Getting to the horse stuff! Horse owners and breeders NEVER say their mares are ""pregnant."" They are 'with foal"", but I guess the dummies who gave this thing 5 stars need explanation. Has director Randall Wallace even ever watched the Triple Crown?!!! At the Kentucky Derby he had the crowds singing ""My Old Kentucky Home"" long before the race. If he'd only watched ONE Kentucky Derby on TV he'd see that the song is NOT sung until the first horse places the first hoofprint on the track. There were no pony horses taking the racehorses to the gate. This is to keep the racehorses calm and assure they are not injured before the race itself.

The races were boring, boring, boring!! If Wallace had actually WATCHED a Triple Crown race he'd see that when a horse who has been behind starts to ""move"" at the stretch, the race announcer will catch that and give a rousing cry which lends an intense suspense to the race. These races were as exciting as washing dishes. ZZZzzzzzzz........The cinematography was dark, filmed on some dreary days so that these beautiful animals did not shine as they should.

I hate racing, know first hand what happens to these poor souls who do not win or earn their keep. Too horrible to tell you here. I only watched because it was on Starz. Would never pay to see this and glad I didn't!

If you want to see the BEST horse racing movie ever made, see ""Phar Lap"", the true story of an Australian underdog of a horse who became unbeatable. It has heart, soul, suspense, great acting and phenomenal photography. 5 hanky at least. And Phar Lap also was a victim of racing.

Great actors in this movie.  Diane Lane did a spectacular job as Penny Chenery.  She really came across as loving the horse and wanting the best for it.  I also loved John Malkovich and the way he played Lucien.  The guy cracked me up throughout the entire movie but he also could be serious when needed.  The rest of the side characters were great as well and all were able to express their emotions well.  And needless to say, the horse was fantastic.  Behaved and trained well and really portrayed a great champion with poise.

Since its a true story I'd have to say that they did a good job of sticking to the real story.  Of course there were some embellishments, but largely it seemed real.  And its a great story.  A real hero and feel good type of movie.  Secretariat inspires and even those against the horse racing industry would be hard pressed to prove that this horse dislikes running the races.  It seemed to revel in it.  The movie makers recreated the races well too, it seemed like actual horse races and had all the anticipation.  I really felt like I was right there cheering Secretariat on.  Despite all this activity though, there were some lulls in the movie that got kind of boring and that's what kept it from being a full five star movie.

If you love horses this is a movie for you.  Its also a good family movie.  Enjoy and cheer on Secretariat!

They all do or try, it is their instinct to get on their feet as soon as possible.

The Belmont scene was the worst of all. Secretariat's Belmont Stakes is one of the most spectacular moments in all of horse racing and to film it anywhere but Belmont Park was an epic fail. Ditto the awful music at the end instead of using Chic Anderson's best race call ever. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it on YouTube. The picture quality is terrible but it should be seen by anyone interested in Secretariat. There is an extended version with a great shot of Mrs. Tweedy waving her arms in the air after the win. I did love seeing her in the stands in the movie. That was a nice Disney touch. :)

I love Disney and I love Secretariat but I wish they would have stuck closer to the facts, a lot closer. They aren't telling a story from a hundred or more years ago and horse racing fans know the facts too well to suspend belief for a movie.",1308441600,11,1526,4.08
4323669,3,B004C03TK2,"Good horse tale. It's based on a true story, and unlike in most Disney films, the mom doesn't die.

The acting was really good--especially John Malkovich.  I usually don't like him as an actor because the characters he plays are nearly always irritating. So is this character: he's a curmudgeon, but with a soft center.

The story was well-written and the dramatic tension held my interest without stressing me out. The sets were great.

And did I mention the horse? Whoever played Secretariat was a good looking pony.

I gave this three stars only because, as a family film that doesn't aspire to anything greater than being a fun movie, it doesn't move into the ""classic animal film"" realm ( Old Yeller, Lassie Come Home, etc.) Can I say that it was a five star for a three-star category film?

4323694,4,B004C03TK2,"I am an avid horse racing person completely familiar with the history of the horse. I went expecting a professional modern movie that took liberty with the truth, but came away surprised. While the woman-against-the-world theme was a little overdone, it had a basis in fact. The rest of the movie was expertly done, and the director/cinematographer team was very careful to minimize the number of gotchas that could have resulted from using real present day settings for backdrops.

  Mr. Horton's review misses some points. The Chenery family DID face a huge estate tax burden that would have sunk her family below the filthy-rich category that he laughably stereotypes her with. If there was a villain, it consisted of a system of confiscatory, predatory tax laws, and the movie didn't dwell upon it enough. In addition, he missed the 70s, or he would have known that the ""Christian"" music that was chosen was actually popular top-40 that made up ""soul"" genre of the time. I'm not 100% sure, but the director seemed to connect it with scenes of the groom, Eddie Sweat, on whose book some of the story is based. For all I know the music could have been some of his own inspiration during the low moments and thus faithful to the past. I should check, and so should have Mr. Horton.

  All in all, it is a well done for a racing-based, sports-based movie, most of which turn me off. I would have done some things differently, but the quality went well beyond my expectations. 4 3/4 stars.",1305158400,,1488,4.681992337164751

4323699,5,B004C03TK2,"This is a story, supposedly, of a horse, but it is also an important story of a courageous and determined young woman named Helen Bates Chenery Tweedy who was called Penney Chenery. Penney, it is believed, was the moving force behind Secretariat and her decisions resulted in Secretariat being the amazing horse that was born on March 30, 1970.

I'll admit I'm a fan of Diane Lane who brings so much to this film as Penney Chenery, her face is so expressive and her acting so very convincing; it's easy to just sit back and watch the story unfold and what a story it is.

Penney had grown up with a tradition and a love for that tradition that carried the day. The youngest of three siblings, she resists an effort to sell the 2,798 acre Meadow Farm, a thoroughbred breeding farm purchased by her father in 1932 when Penney was 10 years old; where the other children saw dollar signs, Penney saw tradition and opportunity.

Her father, Christopher, was confined to a hospital in 1968 and remained there to his death in 1973. The decision to breed their mare, Somethingroyal, to Bold Ruler in 1969 was Penney's and the result of that decision was Secretariat.

It seems to me that the movie does a fine job of tracking the real life story; as with any movie time constraints impose limitations on what can be told. This movie does a grand job of carrying the viewer along as Penney makes choices and exhibits the strength and determination to carry through on her choices.

The sound and picture quality are excellent on the Blu-ray version. The sound is not as dramatic as one finds with Sea Biscuit, for example, but is nevertheless exciting in full surround with a good sub-woofer.

I believe this movie beautifully displays the qualities and ethics that made our country what it was; if one is looking for an exciting movie which promotes an ethical morality this is it. On top of all that it is fun and exciting to watch.

I was interested to note that Meadow Farm is now called Meadow Event Park and in 2009 became the home of the Virginia State Fair.",1304812800,4,2056,4.555555555555555
4323700,5,B004C03TK2,"Even knowing the outcome having watched his triple crown races, this was a thrilling, touching movie. Everything Mrs Tweedy had to overcome including her own husband's and brothers' lack of faith in her judgement, the 'good ol' boys club' mentality and this untested two-year old horse, seeing her and Eddie's unshakable belief in him, just a very, very entertaining movie.",1304726400,2,373,5.233333333333333
4323701,4,B004C03TK2,"This movie initially seemed as if it might suffer from a few handicaps (pun intended). It saddled itself with extra pounds of clichs. (""You'll never know how far you can go if you don't run."") Also, some of the characters come on as stereotypical neigh-sayers. There's the crusty horse trainer who bridles at every approach. But he ultimately transcends his lack of fashion sense and his feisty recalcitrance and instead becomes an invaluable ally in the push to make Secretariat a winner. There's the owner of a rival horse who engages in a lot of trash talk. There's the trim and indomitable owner herself who fights to overcome financial set-backs and male chauvinism to assert herself and keep her stake in the horse she senses is capable of great things.

It's often painful to watch the prejudice that existed against women in the paddocks in the 1970's. It's also painful to see the particular conflict between career and domestic duties that complicated Penny Chenery's life then. Her husband's disaffection with her ""other life"" shows how little support there was for any woman who wanted to pursue an interest of her own rather than simply be subsidiary and supportive of her husband's career and interests.

Other hurdles put in the path of Secretariat's owner on her way to the Triple Crown sometimes seem as if they might have been dragged in strictly for the purposes of sustaining the tension in this film. There are additional personality conflicts, betrayals, and an untimely tooth abscess, that make every day a challenge to be faced with pluck and a can-do competitive spirit.

Despite this predictable arc of a Horatio Alger story, the movie did end up involving me and touching me. It includes some spectacular photography of horses in action. Every viewer will be turned into a horse whisperer as the camera puts you nostril-to-nostril with the straining, striving horse heading for the finish line.",1304640000,,1921,4.978193146417445

In it he admits to greatly liking the movie and having fallen a bit in love with Diane Lane during his stint as film advisor.  I believe the falling in love part, but if he truly liked this movie he must not think much of his book, because it's everything this movie is not.  I guess it's hard to bite the hand that feeds him, no matter how much he'd like to.  If he could, I think we would have seen some unbelievable fangs.  When I watched this film, all I did was count the untruths and half-truths throughout, so I can just imagine what Mr. Nack went through.  That's no way to watch a movie, so my question is this:  Why change the truth when the true story is why you want to make the film in the first place?

Frankly, I went into this movie with quite low expectations.  I do not really consider myself to be a great critic of movies, but I do watch a lot of movies, and I know what I like.  And I like this one!

How do I know that I like it?  First of all, I don't recall looking at my watch once during the viewing.  Secondly, I caught myself smiling to myself many times as the film progressed.  Third, after I finished watching this film the first time, my wife wanted to watch the second half again (she had fallen asleep), so I watched it again with her...and I finished it again, even though she fell asleep again.  (Don't think badly of her...she gets up EARLY and runs, so she tends to fall asleep, even during movies that she really likes).  I also found myself smiling and enjoying the show the second time, just like I did the first time.

There's no need for to me to tell you the story of the film, that's for the film to show, but I found that this is a genuine feel-good film, even amidst the interpersonal challenges faced by the horse's owner and her family.  It was not an easy road to the Triple Crown, but it is a road worth riding.

The acting was quite good, though there were a few weak moments here and there.  I have to admit that I really liked John Malkovich's character...hats and all.  I also liked the jockey quite a bit.

4323738,5,B004C03TK2,"As a Kentucky native I worked on a thoroughbred farm in Lexington in 1975-76, where I had the pleasure of seeing Secretariat at stud at nearby Claiborne Farm. Even from a distance, out to pasture, Big Red's form, carriage, and spirit were clearly unique, distinguishing him from any other horse I'd ever seen. I was also privileged to attend one of his breeding sessions, but about that I'll only say he was just as regally impressive in the breeding shed as on the track.

The movie is a finely crafted and historically accurate dramatization of the horse, his human family, and the racing history and legacy they made together. Diane Lane and John Malkovich are superb in the lead roles of feisty feminist owner Penny Chenery Tweedy and eccentric iconoclast trainer Lucien Lauren. The stellar ensemble cast surrounding them lifts the intensity and quality of individual and collective performance to hoof- and heart-pounding perfection. From editing, music, and cinematography to lighting, direction, and writing, every technical, artistic, and production aspect of the movie coalesces to deliver a first-rate film that in my opinion drills the bullseye of every mark of a classic. Together with its equally impressive precursor SEABISCUIT, SECRETARIAT should be featured at every Derby party leading up to the feature race at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday afternoon of every May, every year, everywhere.

Finally, one can't help but cheer and applaud the stable of colts who played Big Red himself: mainly Trolley Boy, a 6-year-old from Kentucky, and Longshot Max, a 7-year-old from Oklahoma, together with a number of racing doubles. Kudos to veteran horse wrangler Rusty Hendrickson, whose deft handling of these magnificent thoroughbreds vividly captured Secretariat's spirit, demeanor, and intelligence.

John Malkovich was a surprise - I never thought he'd be good in that type of role, but the performance was great.

I would have liked to have seen footage of the different horses used to play ""Big Red"", though... I know they used several in Hidalgo and Seabiscuit, so I'd love to see the ones they used in Secretariat - but alas, it was not included in Special Features.

Over all, a great movie about a great horse, and I'm sure all horse folks will enjoy it. Acting was great, not too much schmaltz.

The casting is perfect.  Diane Lane plays the housewife/owner of the magnificent horse with great feeling, John Malkovich plays the quirky trainer, Margo Martindale (Mags Bennett of ""Justified"") has a smaller but very memorable role, and there are quite a few other name actors scattered throughout the movie including Scott Glenn and James Cromwell.

The final scenes of the Belmont would be hard to film in a non-thrilling way.  But this film was a bit of a let-down, and I think I know why.  I've seen ""Seabiscuit"".  More than once.  It's one of the best movies I ever saw.  And it beats this film by 31 lengths, going away.  In every way: acting, (true) story, cinematography, suspense, humor, pathos, history, it's better.

4323756,5,B004C03TK2,"I had the great good fortune to watch the 1973 Belmont Stakes race live on television, so my interest was piqued when this film came out on DVD. I bought it without any real expectations since I knew the ultimate outcome. I have to say I was most pleasantly surprised.

The first time I watched the movie, I wasn't that impressed as I felt there was a bit too much created drama, but the second time I watched it with my wife, she pointed out that the real story is full of drama. So I settled in and gained even more enjoyment the second time around.

Diane Lane is exceptionally good in the lead role of Penny Chenery Tweedy, and her husband's belated admission that she was able to give their children the lessons in life that he could never do was really a tender and telling moment. John Malkovich seemed near perfect in the role of the maverick trainer, and even his admiration for Mrs. Tweedy garnered some nice concessions along the way. Mrs. Tweedy never lost faith in herself or in her horse, and that is the real lesson of the movie.

Secretariat, or Big Red to those closest to the horse, is simply the greatest horse that ever raced (so far). Out of curiosity, I looked up some of the comparable Triple Crown records, and Secretariat clearly dominated those three races in 1973, and for all time. Some of the margins of vistory are stunning, time wise and in number of lengths. Of course, the Belmont stands out when Secretariat absolutely demolished a group of very good race horses by the unbelievable record of 31 lengths. I remember watching in 1973 to see if Secretariat could win the Triple Crown since that was the longest of the three races. I remember coming out of my chair watching Secretariat pull away in the back stretch and ""pour on the coal"", shouting and clapping. The movie captures this race particularly well, but for those of us who watched it live, it truly was reliving an extraordinary moment in time.

4323757,5,B004C03TK2,"As a child I read all the Walter Farley novels about boys and their wild horses.  So it is no wonder that I own the 1979 Francis Ford Coppola movie adaptation of Farley's, THE BLACK STALLION, starring Kelly Reno, Teri Garr, Hoyt Axton, and Mickey Rooney.  As my parents became too old to enjoy movie-theatre visits, I bought them a VCR, and later a DVD-player, and would have regular ""movie-nights"" for them with the stories I knew they would like.  My folks sat through the entire 2-hours of Farley's story of the magnificent wild Arabian, ""The Black,"" - and continued watching through all of the final credits, which were played over the outtakes of the stallion rolling in the beach-sand with Kelly Reno.  When it finally faded to black, my mother said, ""That's the best movie I've ever watched.""
My parents are gone.  There are now two other ""great-stories-well-told"" about horses and the people who loved them; the 2003 adaptation of the Laura Hillenbrand book SEABISCUIT, starring Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges, and Chris Cooper; and the latest, SECRETARIAT, starring Diane Lane and John Malkovich.
I give 5+ stars to all of them.  The Farley story is of course fiction - but very-well told.  The Hillebrand epoch tells the true story of how the lives of three broken people during the Great Depression were transformed by a nearly-broken horse.  SECRETARIAT tells the improbably but true story of a housewife who came into her own during the Vietnam era, with a horse she acquired with the toss of a coin, and risked everything to make him a winner.  I have a new respect for Diane Lane.  She did a magnificent job.  Malkovich, as the trainer, was his annoying best.  As for the horse, Secretariat - well - he was an Olivier, a Streisand, a Muhammad Ali - in his field he was ""without peer"" - the best!

4323760,2,B004C03TK2,"This is a decent movie (definitely a Disney-fied attempt at great movie making), but not a great one. I didn't see the movie in when it was in theaters, and, in truth, I don't think I heard much about it during its run. I decided to watch the movie because of the low $1.99 price and the ratings. After watching it and reading some of the reviews, I wondered if many of the reviewers had watched another movie or have not seen a great sports or horse racing movie to compare it to. That said, if you want to see a great horse raising movie, and I do mean a great one, watch Seabiscut. It has all the elements of a great movie. It causes you to get emotionally involved with the characters, not just the lead actor or the horse, but with pretty much all of the characters. There is no comparison between the two except for the horses.

No with that behind me, here is my critique of the film. John Malkovich is a terrific actor. I've seen him in many films. Having said that, he should not have been in this one. At the very least, he should not have played a French Canadian. And if he did play a French Canadian, he should not have tried to speak French. Having seen him in several movies,it's clear that accents and languages are not his forte (se Rounders). He cannot do them convincingly. Instead, they become annoying and you want him to stop speaking.

Diane Lane was not very believable as this housewife suddenly cast unawares into the world of horse racing. As it turns out, there is good reason. It seems that the real owner was not new to horse racing or even owning winning horses. The movie tries to hit every emotional note, but fails. It almost seems as if there should be instruction telling you to cue the tears, or the laughter, or the nail biting. Let's take a look at this for a moment. Diane Lane plays a fictional character (I have to say fictional because she was nothing like the character she portrayed) who is willing to lose everything and possibly lose her family and make them ""beggars"" simply because she wants to and feels that it is right. She makes decisions for the entire family then gets upset when they don't agree with her. This kind of ego and hubris is fine if you are single and you're the only one who suffers,but it's kind of hard to cheer for a character like that. I had the same problem with Will Smith's character in The Pursuit of Happiness. Yes, things turned out fine in the end, but how many other people with children who may try the same thing won't have the same success. The Diane Lane character, in my opinion, shares the same self focussed determination, not caring who suffers in the process.

Another problem with the movie is the choice of music. I like gospel like a lot of people, but the movie wasn't very stirring and it needed some better music. Again, it just seems like the makers through in every gimmick they could thing of without thinking of continuity or how well the pieces would fit together. Oftentimes, Hollywood (or Disney in this case) is more concerned about quantity, and much less about quality. This is a case where the latter should have been given more attention. It would have made for a better movie.",1301788800,4,3186,4.424190800681431

As others have pointed out, it isn't a documentary, it's a Disney film. Scretariat is riveting and beautiful. Reality of the times is hinted at but never examined thoroughly. Penny Chenery Tweedy stepped into a world run by men and triumphed. She was Secretariat's Champion in the movie, and perhaps in real life as well. Her bravery and determination shine through in the movie though I have to question whether it was as easy for her to make inroads as the movie portrays. Still, it is a shining example of the courage of the women who paved a way to make things easier for women today. Sometimes we forget that women had to stand up against preconceptions that placed them in lesser roles in days past. The movie is quite enjoyable but I think would've benefited by a few more horse training and racing scenes. The movie worked hard to portray the relationship between Penny Chenery Tweedy and Secretariat as well as her relationship with other people, but seemed to miss a bit of the glory of other horse racing movies that really focus on preparing the horse for the track. Secretariat is an inspiring, uplifting film that will encourage the watcher to keep working for their dreams.",1301529600,,1372,4.6735537190082646

4323773,4,B004C03TK2,"Preface to my review: Reviews are simply an opinion from the viewer. There are a wealth of opinions on this movie and while we are all entitled to our opinions people need to remember some important facts about movies based on true stories or movies that were adapted from a book: It will NOT be identical. Some reviewers got their knickers all twisted up in a bunch because certain things didn't mesh with the real deal. Well, boo-hoo. Anyone expecting absolute greatness from a movie where the story is NOT an original will be disappointed especially if they have inside information on the true story or if they have read the book.

For all intents and purposes, this movie was not flawless but it certainly was entertaining and at times uplifting. The cast was well above average in my opinion. I believe the makers wanted to convey a story about a really great horse-heck the best horse ever according to the experts and sports journalists. I think they did a fine job. Diane Lane certainly has gotten better as an actress and she did a really good job here. One reviewer had an issue with the soundtrack and the Gospel song included. I had zero qualms with soundtrack. I think the second placement of the song in question (Big Red coming around the track in the Kentucky Derby scene)was right on point. Awesome in fact.

A lot of people who didn't like this movie compared it to Seabiscuit. I don't remember that movie and will have to watch it again to decide which of the two I like better. I do know while the movie was centered around horses/horse racing, they were two completely different stories. Also, there were things in Seabiscuit that wasn't completely correct either. At the risk of redundancy, any movie based on a true story will not be an ecaxct replica of that story. Things are changed and altered for thematic purposes and visual appeal. For that reason it will always be different and viewers will just have to get over it or not watch the movie.

This movie doesn't fall short of entertaining. Equestrian history buffs may have issues with it. Movie lovers who are partial to feel good movies will love it it. I suppose it is a toss up for everyone else. All in all it was a good project and if you watch it with an open mind you might just add it to your library.

4323820,4,B004C03TK2,"FILM RATING: 4 stars

Since I first heard about this film, I've wanted to see it. The story of Secretariat is legendary and epic...the stuff for a potentially great movie. And Director Randall Wallace came through on this one. On first viewing, the story struck me as a bit too PG and ""Disney-fied"", but as I've watched several times since, I appreciate some nuances that at first blush passed me by. So I've upgraded my initial rating of 3.5 stars to 4. The film has an emotional depth and maturity that I think will hold up well over the years.

Secretariat is the story of the famed horse that won the Triple Crown in 1973 (the year I was born ironically), winning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes all in a row in a single year. It's also the story of the horse's owner, Penny Chenery Tweedy, played very well by Diane Lane. In supporting roles, John Malkovich, Margo Martindale, and Nelsan Ellis help make the story of the people behind the horse interesting. Secretariat is the most famous racing horse to this day, and no horse has repeated yet as a Triple Crown winner in over 37 years. Who knows...maybe this movie will inspire a new Triple Crown winner this year!

Set in the late 1960's and early 1970's, Secretariat brings that time period and the world of horse racing to life just like Seabiscuit (2003) did a few years ago...and like The Black Stallion (1979) did when I was a kid. I personally think Secretariat is a little better than Seabiscuit, but both are really good horse racing films. I haven't seen The Black Stallion in a lot of years, so I'm not sure how I would rate it cinematically, but I remember I loved it as a kid! Disney and director Wallace made a film here that is accessible to a broad range of audiences like the other two films I mentioned. That both helps the film and hurts it. By making a PG film, Wallace and Disney don't quite give the film the edginess it needs to propel in to the cinematic hall of fame, but kids today now have a new story about horse racing that they can cling to and come to appreciate like I did with The Black Stallion. I've always loved horses in movies, and Secretariat reminds me of the simple joys of watching a horse race, like I did a few times as a teenager with my parents.

What strikes me more than anything about Secretariat is the cinematography by legendary Director of Photography Dean Semler. He is truly one of the greatest cinematographers of all time, bringing us unforgettable images in Dances With Wolves (1990), Dead Calm (1989), Apocalypto (2006), We Were Soldiers (2002), and Appaloosa (2008)...to name a few. Semler really went outside his normal camera box with Secretariat, using images from all sorts of resources, including small digital cameras in addition to 35mm film. One of the special features on the Secretariat Blu-ray discussed some of the photography during the horse races, which fascinated me as a photographer and filmmaker. Semler uses small digital cameras to capture some fascinating images of the horses and the races up close and personal, giving us an up-close and personal look at  horse racing like we've never seen. Kudos to Semler and Wallace for daring to look outside of just the standard horse racing images we've seen before and bringing a fresh take to this sub-genre of movies. The photography definitely gives this film at least 1 of it's stars because it is so striking compared to the average film.

Production Design by Thomas E. Sanders and Art Direction by Sarah Boardman and Naaman Marshall really shines in Secretariat as well. With so many well designed productions these last few years, we seem to take these talented film team members for granted, but I for one really appreciate all the hard work they put into getting all the details of the sets, locations, costumes, make-up, and props just right. The magic of film is that when its done right (like here), you are transported to another world, another time, and another place. If something distracts you from the believability of that escape, then it doesn't work as well. But the production design of Secretariat is spot on, supporting and enhancing the story, as it should.

While the true test of Secretariat will be how it holds up over the next decade, it's definitely a film for the whole family. Kids and adults alike can find something here to grab on to. If there was more of a male lead character that I could strongly relate to, this story might be stronger for me. But getting in to Penny's shoes for 2 hours is enough to make me like this film more than most. While Secretariat won't make me revise my Top 10 films of 2010, it's probably in the 11-20 range. 2010 was just such a competitive year in movies that in another year, Secretariat would surely rise to the top like the horse itself did in 1973. Now I have a film to remind me of what was truly great about the year I was born...other than me being born of course!",1299974400,,4957,4.594350282485876

These were sunflower yellow families whose kids wanted to run away and join Allende's Chile and stole their school project idea from Simon and Garfunkel and pretended to pass it off on their own. The avocado kids were up to their knees in rice patties getting their limbs shot off by Charlie.

Since we already know the horse wins the triple crown, the movie attempts to create drama where none exists. John Malkovich plays a trainer whose clothes sometimes appear to be made from discarded table cloths. The husband is stereotypically non-supportive, until the end. When dad dies the poor family has a 6 million dollar estate tax and only 11 million dollars worth of horses. My heart just bled for poor little rich Penny who wanted to keep her prize horse. Around this point she becomes a Republican, who attends all white parties while the black horse groomer sleeps on hay.

4323845,5,B004C03TK2,"I was 14 when Secretariat won the triple crown, and I knew about it but didn't see any of the races. I found this movie a great look back at the era. Diane Lane and John Malkovich both did a superb job with their roles, and the story telling also was very effective.

My dad mentioned that this movie seemed to have a feminist angle. I'm not sure I agree. True, it deals with a woman entering into a male dominated world -- this world being horse racing. But I did not pick up a ""I am woman, hear me roar"" tone. Rather, I see her surrounding herself with people -- men -- who knew what they were doing, listening to their input, and being man ... I mean woman ... enough to apologize when in error.

This movie is rated with a straight PG. I always say that parents should watch every movie with their children. In this case, I think this movie gives parents opportunity to, after the movie, discuss the lessons that come out in the story.

One bit of trivia. Scott Glenn plays the father of the main character, and former Senator and Presidential candidate Fred Thompson portrays his best friend. Do you know what other movie these two actors shared a scene in? You might have to do some HUNTing FOR this movie; it may be on the RED shelf this OCTOBER.",1299456000,3,1253,4.2784810126582276

The places where everything took place were sooo beautiful.  The horses were fantastic!  I did not see the name of the horse who played Secretariat, unless his name was ""Big Red"" but he was beautiful.  The costumes were authentic.  I loved everything about this film.  The trainer was terrific and of course Diane Lane was perfect.  I really liked the way they showed the actual races, horses running, dirt flying and everything. I also really liked the way they showed the connection between Big Red and Penny.  They way the horse observed her as if he could read her thoughts.  It was fabulous!

I also liked the way they showed the real Penny at the end of the film in the grand stands.  That was subtle and great.

I am very happy that I purchased this DVD.  You should also.

As far as what I would have wanted to know before purchasing,  I have always been interested in horese racing, just for viewing; although I would love to see a live race sometime.

Great things can be what you do in your own world - the effect you have on your community and sphere of influence. The only downside to this movie is that movies like this are so few and far between. We would be served better with more like this. I have heard it said that movies can change culture.

4323912,5,B004C03TK2,"I was pleasantly surprised to see this movie in a recent newsletter and was very keen to purchase after so many positive reviews. This is a film not just about Secretariat but of his owner Penny Chenery Tweedy, who takes over her ailing father's Meadow stables, played brilliantly by Diane Lane. John Malkovich was also outstanding as trainer Lucien Laurin. Critics will argue about some of the facts and the direction this movie takes towards his owner, but make no mistake this is a truly enjoyable film and one that the whole family will enjoy. The race scenes were well done, however if there is minor complaint about this film it is his win in the Belmont Stakes by 31 lengths. It was building up well until they went into slow motion with the horse entering the straight and the crowd looking more in awe than cheering, which is not what it was really like. It left me a little deflated and took away the excitement at that point. That aside the extras on the DVD are excellent with real footage of his Triple Crown wins, commentary from the people associated with this great horse, including Diane Lane, John Malkovich, Penny Chenery Tweedy, the other cast members and journalists reporting on this great horse. This is a feel good movie with moments of sadness and many exhilarating moments. I highly recommend this movie.",1298332800,,1330,4.71244635193133

The quality of the film is a little on the made-for-tv side, but that could be easily overlooked by a child, which is the intended audience. It got a bit boring with the whole rebellious, communist daughter scenes, but I suppose family issues had to be a part of the story.

The passion is all left in the barn due to flat performances by everyone on screen (except the horses). What little pathos that exists in this yawner is, like the characters themselves, never well developed.  We don't learn to really love or hate (or even care for) anyone, including Secretariat's loud-mouthed antagonist or John Malkovich's clown-suited trainer character.

I'm stopping now because I just re-read Robert Horton's' editorial review (at the top of all reviews) and he is saying exactly what I'm saying -- but MUCH better.

Diane Lane and John Malkovich were the perfect choices for their roles; in fact, the entire cast was amazing. Even though I knew the Great One's story front and back, I was on the edge of my seat during all of his race scenes. Big Red's performance at the Belmont will never, never be equaled and I am certain that any future portrayals on the silver screen will never be the equal to this wonderful film.

Note: No other horse in the history of horse racing has been able to come close to the record breaking stride of Big Red. 5 potato, six potato.",1297728000,,510,4.615384615384615
4323968,3,B004C03TK2,"""Secretariat"" (2010) traces the pivotal years in the life of one of the most famous thoroughbred race horses in history, winner of the Triple Crown in 1973. The horse was known as Big Red. His trainer was Lucien Laurin, played by John Malkovich in one of the few likable roles I have seen him in. He's usually a sneering nasty guy. When Penny Chenery's mother died, she hurried to her parents' Virginia home in order to comfort her father who was in the first stages of senility. The father lived on a large farm, and bred race horses, but it was financially a losing proposition. Her brother and her husband wanted her to sell out the farm and the stock. She was determined to hold onto the farm and horses because she knew how much they meant to her father. Her brother and husband were unsupportive and against her.
 This movie is not as involving as the two Sea Biscuit films because that horse was the underdog that became the favorite of the American people. Sea Biscuit was a horse that beat all the odds and triumphed. Except for one loss early on, Secretariat seemed to have it made.
 The dynamics of the family seem to be glossed over in this Disney film. When we first see the Penny's husband he seems autocratic, and we get a somewhat negative picture of him. In the movie he is pictured as being opposed to his wife's objectives. She is away for long periods training and racing the horse while he is left to raise two girls and two boys. The kids seem so perfect and so malleable that they never cross over into being real three-dimensional kids. It looks as if there is friction between husband and wife, and he is not fully supportive until the horse wins the second Triple Crown race. Something is not kosher in the relationship we are shown. The father and the kids are drawn in broad strokes, and the wife is the focal point.
 Secretariat lost a crucial race early on because of an infection, but from that point on it was full sailing. The drama of the jockey in ""Sea Biscuit"" made that movie so engrossing. This one is almost a study in how Penny was able to finance things and keep the horse racing. The movie doesn't have that much drama and thunderous conflict to keep you fully engaged.
 We see the loyal secretary Mis Ham, groom Eddie Sweat and jockey Ron Turcotte. Fred Thompson, former senator and Republican presidential candidate, makes a brief appearance and apparently had another commitment as his part was written out of the script. Secretariat was perhaps the greatest racehorse of all time, but the film, though a pleasant diversion, fails to sweep you away.",1297728000,,2594,4.560085836909871
4323969,3,B004C03TK2,"I must be getting old, because after I watched ""Secretariat"" my immediate thought was: ""This would be a great film to watch with (fill in the name of various nieces, nephews, young cousins, children of friends).""

I think the movie does a pretty good job of being a wholesome family film, with an ""attack your goals, strive for greatness, don't fear a challenge"" theme, and manages to be entertaining while doing so.  Diane Lane, who looks absolutely gorgeous, does a great job.  She's completely committed to the role and the movie, and never once does she fold under the hokey dialogue they put in her mouth.  I also loved seeing Nelsan Ellis (who plays Lafayette on ""True Blood"") playing a role as low-key as his regular role is flamboyant.

Randall Wallace does his best to put you in the jockey's seat during the horse races.  We see bucking point of view shots and the world shakes with the thundering of horse hooves.  Mike Rich, who also wrote the brilliant sports movie ""The Rookie,"" doesn't quite do as good of a job.  It cannot be underestimated how huge the Secretariat story was.  I think the script does an underwhelming job of showing you just how seismic its impact was.  And going into the final race, with a dominating horse with the chance to win the Triple Crown, the movie doesn't express the excitement and national intrigue.  They toss off the knowledge that the horse was featured on the cover of ""Time"" magazine in a single line of dialogue.

So it's not a perfect movie, and not the place to look if you want the facts of Secretariat's run to history, but it's a nice little film to watch with your kids.  I'm sure that's what Disney was aiming for, though I do think they could have created something even better.",1297555200,,1740,4.592233009708738

There are times when you want a movie that is not only a true story but one you know has a fabulous ending without disaster involved. Perfect film when you need something to lift you up.
I admit, I looked up Secretariat's story online and wanted to know his history BEFORE watching the movie because I didn't want to see the horse die, get sick or be hurt during the film.  I had just dumped a movie earlier in the day after the first 45 seconds due to a serial killer about to set a kitten up to be tortured and killed(Diane Lane ironically in that movie also).
I was happy to know ""Big Red"" lived a long life and won the triple crown pushing out in front of the other horses and winning by more then 31 lengths.  Amazing.
I was all warm and fuzzy knowing that his owner loved him and he wasn't mistreated a day in his life.  He sired 600 foals after his racing days were over then sadly had to be put down after an illness that was incurable.  He was a wonderful horse with a great family who loved him. (Film does not go into his death later in life)

I thought Seabiscuit was a better movie, as it was more about the horse (regardless of a couple of minor mistakes) and how all the ""players"" came together at a time in our history when the people needed inspiration.

I remember when Secreatariat was racing and it was exciting to see a Triple Crown winner after 25 years!  I thought the acting by Diane Lane was superb!  She should have been nominated for an Academy Award!!

Anyone who doesn't care about the accuracy of history or telling a ""true"" true story should definitely see this hokey movie.  But if you want some level of truth then this is not the place to go for it.  No surprise that it is so religiously influenced.  Nobody knows better how to spin a story like a catholic or how not to care about the truth.

By the way, the coin toss story in this movie.  All wrong.  The Wood Memorial?  Sham did not win, Secretariat's stable mate did.(Angle Light)  What was the crowd so mad about?  If they bet on Secretariat they still cashed.  Angle Light and Secretariat were an entry.  Paul Feliciano was not fired after Secretariat lost his first race. Feliciano was on him eleven days later when he broke his maiden.  This is just some of the nonsense in this movie.  What a disgrace.",1297209600,24,1063,4.60427807486631

The characters are stilted & predicatable & pretty forgettable....except for Penney.  The kids in her family don't seem to age very much despite the chronological progression.  How neat is that.

It's too bad the horse's dam doesn't get more kudos for his successes, all I hear is Bold Ruler this, Bold Ruler that, and from what I've read, he wasn't that great.

Phrases like ""in foal"" not ""pregnant.""  And it's a ""boy""....no.  It's a stud colt.  That's horseman lingo.  >cringe<

The race at Belmont is thrilling, but then comes this ""O Happy Day"" music???  Religious overtones, notching Secreteriat to the level of a deity?  I think not.  Please.  Just a horse who ran incredible races.

Secretariat's career wasn't followed to the end, the movie touches on the fact that he was smart and that he had a huge heart but the race footage wasn't real. They only used bits of the original footage for the Preakness. The Wood, the Derby and (worst of all) the Belmont were all fake, not him. For real information about Secretariat, the horse, I'd recomend Bill Nack's book. Let me also say I felt the same way about Seabiscuit.",1297036800,5,631,4.448275862068965

Malkovich is hurrying through it as if he's got something better to do (he probably did!) and Ozzy Ozborn would have been more convincing as the owner than Diane Lane.

If you really want to be inspired by this story of Secretariat, watch, Kentucky Derby week, ESN Classic's Sportscentury program made about Secreatariat when he was named in the top 100 athletes in 2000.  It has real footage and people from that time and actual footage of Secretariat's races.  There is at least one glaring historical inaccuracy in the film, and since it's my understanding Chenery Tweedy served as a consultant, I'm surprised she didn't note it.  It's well known to fans of racing that it was NOT Secretariat that first put the Meadow back in the limelight when Penny Chenery took it over for her father. It was his stablemate Riva Ridge that put them back on the thoroughbred racing map. It would be the year AFTER that, that Secretariat won the Triple Crown. And I'm sorry, but I detested the soundtrack. Disney should have hired John Debney (who did Dreamer) or one of the better composers. Listening to ""Oh Happy Day"" during the Belmont race sequence until the end of the movie was not an effective soundtrack for that sequence, at least for me.",1297036800,7,1099,4.713541666666667
4323978,5,B004C03TK2,"In reading the reviews here, I'm utterly speechless at some of the commentary bashing this film.  So it's not 100 percent historically accurate.  So we haven't met some of the original players personally.  Some complained of the gospel music playing as the horse crossed the finish line at Belmont.  They didn't ""get"" it.  I suggest they watch the film again because if they don't ""get it"" they missed a very important earlier scene.

There's an underlying story here of hope and redemption that is far more important for those not old enough to remember the events precisely as they happened. We're currently living in a country where it seems we have so few opportunities and so little to hope for.  This is a movie about taking chances and coming out on top.  No foul language, no violence and it's beautifully filmed. Penny Tweedy went from being a housewife to a being a woman no one really believed in - except Secretariat.  Lucian Lauren felt like a loser, but he saw a drive in both her and the horse that compelled him to come back.  And this was a horse that was more interested in eating and sleeping than in running, or so they thought. What they couldn't know, was the competitive spirit that resided within the heart of a champion. Forget history.  Pretend like you never read the book and you've never heard of this horse.  No, it's not ""Sea Biscuit"".  It's not supposed to be Sea Biscuit.  It's a different kind of story and if you'll allow yourself to just let go, it will be one of the most pleasant and rewarding experiences one can ever have watching a movie.  Take the kids.  Take your parents.  Take the whole family.  You'll walk away with your heart a little lighter than when you started and that's what a movie is supposed to do.",1296950400,11,1755,4.552715654952077

The film was not dynamic with few (but predictable) plot twists, the acting was mediocre, and the story was generally uninteresting. I actually enjoy when films like this are Hollywoodized, with a little extra drama added to the story, making it more interesting (and historically incorrect, I know, but much more interesting to watch... I don't go to the movies for a history lesson). I was disappointed that there was no real ""drama"" - horse racing is always a gamble, and Penny Chenery was no exception; she just happened to get lucky this time.

And the movie is nearly 2 hours long - much longer than it needed to be.

If you need an inspiring horse racing flick, Seabiscuit is much better (check out Rotten Tomatoes).",1296950400,,857,4.662251655629139

4323981,3,B004C03TK2,"You try hard to judge something on its own merit. It's just that the specter of the SEABISCUIT film is crapdoodling all over this one. I liked SECRETARIAT, but there were bits in it that were sorta wonky. Indisputably, it's a story that needed to be told, concerning a legendary Triple Crown champion that ranks as one of history's most fabulous racehorses, and perhaps the most fabulous racehorse, at that. Diane Lane is fine, although there were moments in which she comes off a bit too strident, over-the-top. Lane plays Penny Chenery Tweedy, a Denver housewife who decides to run her parents' horse-breeding operation. Her brother just wants to sell the family business to remain solvent. But Penny, willful and bold, strives on, hanging her sack of hopes and dreams on the promising young foal Big Red, son of Bold Ruler. Because the race track commission states that the name ""Big Red"" is much too common a name for a horse, Penny changes it to Secretariat.

Penny's long commutes between Denver and Virginia exact a toll in the Tweedy household, her husband feeling neglected, not at all supportive of her daring ventures in the sport of kings. It's a fine line between foolhardy and inspired, and mostly it hinges on whether you pull off your crazy schemes or not. It helps that Penny has the thoroughbred to back up her gamble. In the 1970s Secretariat captured the horse racing public's imagination, and the press's imagination. The film focuses on Secretariat's historic run at the Triple Crown, a feat that, at that time, had not been accomplished in a quarter of a century. The question leading into the arduous Belmont Stakes was whether Secretariat had the endurance to go with the vaunted speed. But of course, on that day, Secretariat blew away the competition by 31 lengths. When Secretariat died, his heart was discovered to be twice as big as any other horse's heart. No one was surprised.

SECRETARIAT is quite watchable and predictable and there were things that nagged. Lane's few inspirational speeches feel contrived, overdramatic. People were amazed by Lane's performance here, and I agree that she did very well. But I wonder how much of the fave reaction is in seeing an actress not known for taking a role which calls for her to be fierce. I wasn't that impressed with Sandra Bullock in THE BLIND SIDE, either. I expect any screenplay to be manipulative, and it's cool as long as it avoids the pitfalls of being too familiar or lazy or over-the-top or anything else that rips you out of the story. That scene with Penny's trainer's assistant or horse walker yelling at an empty Kentucky race track that it hasn't seen nothin' yet is utter cheese, man. That whole tired thread about Penny's disintegrating marriage was a downer. There's too much anthropomorphizing of Secretariat, and I think it cost the film some of its grounding. I was cringing a little during the scene in which an injured Secretariat and Penny were soulfully gazing into each other's eyes, Penny trying to determine if her horse can carry on, and Secretariat... I don't know that he was thinking anything... because he's a friggin' horse.

John Malkovich co-stars as Secretariat's colorful, French-spewing trainer Lucien Laurin. But even his brand of quirk doesn't alter the fact that he's strictly a supporting character, the movie clearly about the horse and his owner. There's a half-finished feel to the rest of the cast.

I have to bring up SEABISCUIT, a film that was more in context, more immersive, more grounded, and had more breadth, had more heart. Secretariat plied his trade in the early '70s, during the Vietnam War and during the hippie age, and this backdrop, to me, doesn't resonate as deeply as the Great Depression. To me, the Biscuit was an even more compelling underdog, and there's a deeper emotional pull in watching the Depression-era public identify with the short, ungainly, lopsided Seabiscuit.

But, don't get me wrong, I cheered like mad during Secretariat's epic and very surreal assault at the Belmont record. That sequence is almost as entertaining as the printed press war over this film between film critic Roger Ebert and Salon reviewer Andrew O'Hehir.

I think I'll go for the trifecta and go watch PHAR LAP.

The DVD's bonus material: ""Heart of A Champion""- a featurette about Secretariat, mostly focusing on his taking of the Triple Crown and including an interview with the real life Penny Chenery  (00:14:56 minutes long); 3 Deleted Scenes with Director's introduction (totaling 00:03:41 minutes); and A.J.

The DVD does not disappoint at all, and the bonus features are everything we hoped they would be, at least the ones that pertain to the movie. This is a movie, not a documentary, but hopefully it will introduce Secretariat to new fans and a new appreciation for the horse and his story. Hopefully, they will seek to know more after seeing the film and find the resources they need in books and on the Internet.

Secretariat captures something that many people do not understand -- why stock men and women invest and risk everything in their animals and decisions, the chance to produce the best. Nothing is certain, though everyone tries for a winner, you never know for sure what you're going to get any breeding program. When you produce a champion, it is a miracle, and when they win, it is cause for so much jubilation. The choice of ""Oh Happy Day"" was spot on -- Rejoice every time you see this movie. It will lift you up and carry you each time you watch it...",1296864000,,1132,4.339622641509434
4323993,3,B004C03TK2,"This benign and somewhat stodgy 2010 Disney production is aimed squarely at the same audience who cheered at the against-all-odds dramaturgy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blind-Side/dp/B002VECM6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blind Side</a>. To his credit, director Randall Wallace (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Were-Soldiers/dp/B000068TPN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Were Soldiers</a>) manages to build galloping momentum in telling the familiar story of Secretariat, the legendary chestnut Thoroughbred who won the Triple Crown in 1973, even though the ending is a given. The movie is strangely bipolar. On the track, there is a palpable sense of urgency in the way Dean Semler's high-definition camera captures the spirit of the races, complemented by the Edwin Hawkins Singers' 1969 rendition of ""Oh Happy Day"". Dressed in his blue-and-white blinker hood, the racehorse shows the majestic prowess that combined speed and stamina to allow him to bolt from dead last to the finish line. The movie pushes hard to make the races evoke religious inspiration.

Off the track, it tries for the same effect but falls short because screenwriter Mike Rich sticks close to formula in telling the story of Penny Chenery, a Denver housewife who unexpectedly took over her ailing father's Virginia stable after her mother's death. Knowing nothing about raising horses, she wins Secretariat in a coin toss and instinctively knows through the horse's bloodlines that she has a winner on her hands. Not afraid to fire a corrupt trainer, she recruits the eccentric Lucien Laurin to push Secretariat to his full potential. The script elevates Chenery to a benevolent figure whose dedication is portrayed as noble and pure. That she willingly leaves her family for long stretches of time barely generates any honest conflict at home. In turn, there is little depth to any of the characters in spite of a stellar cast of actors who are capable of doing more than they are allowed here.

A far cry from the guilt-ridden adulteress she played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unfaithful/dp/B00006RCNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unfaithful</a>, Diane Lane effectively plays Penny with steely resolve under the constraints of her real-life character's well-moneyed, genteel manner and a Pat Nixon-style blonde wig. As the comically eccentric Laurin, John Malkovich has a field day wearing bad hats and screaming French profanity. The rest of the cast play their stock characters with aplomb - Margo Martindale as devoted secretary Miss Ham, Dylan Walsh as Penny's testy husband, James Cromwell as a powerful breeder, singer/musician Amanda Michalka as Penny's hippie daughter, and Nelsan Ellis as the deferential groom. Scott Glenn is wasted in the role of Penny's catatonic father. This is wholesome traditional fare that does its job in injecting fervor to the racetrack scenes and predictability to the inspiring backstory of the world's greatest racehorse.

The 2011 DVD adds three excisable deleted scenes; a 15-minute featurette (""Heart of a Champion"") that focuses on the horse, not the movie; a four-minute video of the ending credits song, Michalka's ""It's Who You Are""; and two shorts focusing on the joys of Blu-Ray. The 2011 Blu-Ray adds a dry audio commentary track from Wallace; a standard six-minute making-of featurette (""Choreographing the Races""); a 21-minute conversation with the real Penny Chenery, now a feisty 88; a unique feature that allows four historical perspectives - a jockey's, a sports reporter's, a historian's, and a spectator's - on Secretariat's performance in the 1973 Preakness Stakes through a CGI simulation; and four more deleted scenes.",1296864000,2,3801,5.85740072202166
4323994,3,B004C03TK2,"SECRETARIAT is a solid Disney film for families about the importance of god sportsmanship and the devotion of people to animals and the bonding that can take place.  Based on William Nack's book SECRETARIAT: THE MAKING OF A CHAMPION and adapted for the screen by Mike Rich the film is a solid biography of a great horse and an even more interesting statement about women surviving and excelling in a 'man's world' of sports.  as directed by Randall Wallace the film takes care to develop the history of the great horse, from before his birth through the birthing process, the training and the exhilaration of triumph. The time frame of the story is well captured and the cast delivers solid performances.  Diane Lane (in a somewhat unusual role for her0 is the owner Penny Chenery who takes over her father's horse ranch - Chris Chenery is portrayed by Scott Glenn - and the important contributors to the growth and subsequent fame of the horse are John Malkovich (playing John Malkovich assuming the role of Lucien Laurin) and the redoubtable Margo Martindale as Miss Ham.

This film will appeal to audiences who love biographies, especially those of animals.  There is a fine sense of delivery of this interesting tale but somehow it never catches fire and seems longer than its 123 minutes.  The reason to watch this film may very well be to watch the true star of the film - the horse 'Big Red' AKA Secretariat.  Grady Harp, February 11",1296777600,,1440,4.736

4324028,5,B004C03TK2,"I have enjoyed horse movies all my life, I've seen the classics, and those that did not do well in box office sales.  I have a passion for horses, but even more so, a passion for that connection between horse and human.  Secretariat provides a great story line with stellar cast, it is inspiring, heart-warming, and offers a rare glimpse into what horses can do when they are directed and supported rather than forced.  The heart of the horse is an amazing thing and in this movie we get to see a horse who runs with all his heart - and - loves it.

I am not sure how much children would enjoy it, there are a lot of adult issues Penny faces (the passing of her parents, tension with her husband and brother, and walking straight into a clearly male-dominated world.)  On the other hand, I think it's quite inspiring for girls to see a woman standing up for her convictions, living her life with the same heart Secretariat ran his races.

I was impressed with the attention to detail, the cinematography, and the edge-of-your-seat anticipation during racing scenes (even though we already knew how history played out!)

My only cons are I wish there was more about Secretariat's character so we could get to know him better as did Eddie Sweat who was said to have spent the most time with him, and, what I felt were some cheezy family scenes.  But then again, I am more interested in the genuine heart and character of the horse than I am in what Hollywood makes of a story, so this may be merely personal preference.  For true stories I rely on documentaries and books.

Bottom line:  I recommend this film, it is inspiring and encouraging, honoring the beautiful spirit of the horse and the indomitable spirit of the people who believed in him.

You run your race, you *let* him run his. - wise words from Penny's father, a man who understood the heart of the horse",1296259200,6,1867,4.491124260355029

I felt it was more the story of Mrs. Tweedy and her family than it was about the greatest horse ever to step on a racetrack. The writers made up alot of the story, she wasn't there when he was born, I doubt she ever gave him a bath or showed up at the stable in her ball gown the night before the Belmont.

4324043,4,B004C03TK2,"The early '70s, a tumultuous time where Americans were fed up with the war, the politics and wanted to see some glimmer of hope.  From the USA losing to USSR in the Olympics in controversial fashion, in 1973, the year proved to be a magical year as many Americans came together to support a race horse named ""Secretariat"".

Afterall, it's been 25-years since a horse has won the U.S. Triple Crown and there was so much hype going into this Triple Crown as owner Penny Chenery, a Colorado Housewife and daughter of a horsetrainer, came to take over the role that her father once had as an owner and breeder for racing horses.  As many men didn't think she could do it, with the right people, each of them came to put their belief and for Chenery, she gambled everything in hopes that this horse can win that Triple Crown and in fantastic and amazing fashion, she did.

Secretariat was the first horse to win this amazing feat in 25 years and an amazing horse that continues to hold the record at the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes.

It has been over 30 years since America has had a Triple Crown winner and many have come close but to lose it at the Belmont Stakes (The final competition of the Triple Crown) and many are still awaiting a new champ, and at times wonder if there will ever be a horse like Secretariat.

But let's not categorize Secretariat as any normal racing horse, this one was quite special.

Not only because it broke records and because how it gained so much attention from fans to non-fans of the sport, his winning of the Triple Crown was remarkable and memorable as it was televised and the story of Secretariat even continued after his death in 1989 as autopsy has found that his heart was twice the size of a regular horse's heart and is known as an ""x-factor"" that only special horses have.  Specifically, the race horse Eclipse who had an enlarged heart from the late 1700's (80-90% of race horses today have Eclipse in their pedigree) and research has found that Secretariat had traces from a dam-line to the daughter of Eclipse.

The horse was able to read the people around him, he knew when won, he knew when he lost.  This horse had intuition and he loved the attention from photographers (yes, this horse would pose for the cameramen) and had great stature.  Researching this horse, you can't help but be amazed.

But as the story of ""Secretariat"" was amazing, the story of its owner and how Secretariat winning the Triple Crown may have not happened if it was not for Penny Chenery Tweedy, the daughter of the late Christopher Chenery who breeded race horses but due to his declining health, was unable to continue his duties at the farm and trusted people to watch over his interests.

Penny who was a married housewife and dedicated her life to her husband four children was thrust into a position as a businesswoman who was determined to continue her father's legacy and eventually find the right people to train and race this horse.  She left her family behind, going back and forth from the farm in Virginia and back home.  She only had her determination and the belief from those around her that she can truly make a Triple Crown win a reality.

Life was not easy as this housewife from Colorado would have to leave her family over the course of four years off an on to make sure the horse was ready to race and take care of operations of her father's business and to make things even more challenging, her brother and even her husband wanted her to sell the business and horses, because their farm was so much in debt.

But Penny Chenery was determined in keeping her father's legacy alive and this is the basis of the movie ""Secretariat"", a film adaptation of the book ""Secretariat: The Making of a Champion"" by William Nack.

The film would feature director Randall Wallace (""Braveheart"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""We Were Soldiers""), a screenplay adaptation by Mike Rich (""Finding Forrester"", ""The Rookie""), composer Nick Glennie-Smith (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, ""The Rock"", ""Con Air"") and cinematography by Dean Semler (""Dances with Wolves"", ""2012', ""xXx"", ""Apocalypto"").

The film which was budgeted at $35 million, went on to make over $59 million in the box office and now the movie will be released on Blu-ray and DVD on January 25, 2011.

VIDEO:

""Secretariat"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Colors are absolutely vibrant and for a film that takes place in the late '60s and early '70s, the presentation looks very good on Bluray. Detail is quite evident with the paint on the stable, the grime on the jockey's faces, the dirt lifting off the tracks when the horses are racing and overall, wonderful cinematography from Dean Semler.

But there is crush that does showup from time-to-time and blacks are sometimes muted.  But by no means is this distracting.  The textures are great and I didn't notice any banding or any artifacting at all.  No sign of DNR and for the most part, this film looks absolutely great on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Secretariat"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English DVS2.0 Dolby Digital, French and Spanish Dolby Digital. ""Secretariat"" is pretty much center and front channel driven for the majority of the dialogue-driven film.  But once the races start, that is when the surround channels are kicked into full gear as the announcer can be heard through the surround channels, the crowd gasping and cheering for Secretariat and you can hear the horse's hoof's.

You can hear the ambiance of the film (may it be the crowd, in the stable), you can hear it through the surround channels.  So, there is good use of surround channels in this film.

Also, the film has its share of '70s music and the music comes quite clear through the front channels.  The music composed by Nick Glennie-Smith (""The Rock"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films"", ""Con Air"") is also dramatic and well-done but if there is one major nitpick I did have about this film, it's the final music used during the Belmont competition.  I felt it would have been better served to use an instrumental song to capture the mood courtesy of Glennie-Smith than using a '70s song.  It just didn't seem right for that moment but that is my opinion.

If there is one thing that I wished, Disney has been moving towards a 7.1 lossless soundtrack lately and so I was hoping that ""Secretariat"" would have a 7.1 lossless soundtrack.  But for the most part, this lossless soundtrack is very good!

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Secretariat"" features the following special features:

  * Heart Of A Champion - (14:56) This feature is on the DVD of the film and the real life Penny Chenery and the actual people who worked with the original Secretariat plus the cast and crew talk about Secretariat.
  *
  Choreographing The Races - (6:27) This piece looks at how director Randall Wallace and the filmmakers used innovative tools and technology to accurately and excitingly recreate the Triple Crown races that make the viewer feel like they are standing on the backstretch themselves.  For filmmakers, this featurette was quite intriguing on the rigs that were built and how risky and difficult it was to shoot this footage.
  *
  A Director's Inspiration: A Conversation With The Real Penny Chenery - (21:10) Director Randall Wallace sits down with Secretariat owner Penny Chenery to review the movie and some of the key scenes. Penny reflects on what it was like to have been a woman in a male dominated sport and to have been part of horse racing's most exciting moments in history. Definitely my favorite featurette as Penny Chenery talks about how things were in reality vs. how things were in the film.
  *
  Audio Commentary By Director Randall Wallace - Optional audio commentary from Director Randall Wallace who talks about working on a movie that deals with horses and trying to make horse racing and racing choreography work for a feature film.  A pretty cool and informative commentary!
  *
  Deleted Scenes With Optional Audio Commentary By Director Randall Wallace - Featuring seven deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Randall Wallace: Alternate Opening, Introduction, ""Are You A Golfer?"", No Time To Rest, Memories, Seth Joins The Team and Too Soon To Celebrate

JUDGMENT CALL:

I actually first became interested in ""Secretariat"" when I started following the Triple Crown back in 1993.  Everyone had dreamed of having another ""Triple Crown"" winner and one wondered if it would happen again anytime soon. After all, people waited 25 years until Secretariat would win in 1973.  And in 1997, it looked like it was going to happen once again nearly 25-years later with Silver Charm but it wasn't meant to be.

But although I don't take part in the betting side of horse racing, I do recognize the work that these families who own the horses put into breeding them, training them and preparing them for these competitions.  Knowing the danger for the jockeys, knowing the stress and tear that some of these horses go through in a race, but you wonder if there will be anything close to a ""Secretariat"" (and I know some of you will respond with a ""Zenyatta"" comment).

But one has to realize that this horse, Secretariat, was truly phenomenal not just for its time but even impressive when you see these records that were broken and have not yet been beaten today.  Not only was this a horse that knew instinctively how to win, it was like he was born with the magic touch.  This horse wanted to win and those near him would talk about how he was fantastic, not just as a horse should respond or how a horse should race but since birth, he shown a lot of potential and promise.

So, I think that ""Secretariat"" was seen as an iconic horse back in the early '70s.  People wanted something to believe with the Vietnam War going nowhere, public moral was literally down and so you look to sports for some excitement of that American spirit.  But in 1972, with the US loss to Russia in the Olympics, needless to say, Americans felt deflated.  So, in 1973, when you had a housewife, but a magnificent business woman taking up ownership and showing us her strength as an owner to one of the best racing horses of all time, putting everything all on the line for  horse in hopes that it would win the Triple Crown and accomplishing this rare and magnificent feat., it's no surprise that Americans who were fans or non-fans of the sport, tuned in!

""Secretariat"" the film was a film that I look forwarded to but at the same time, I wondered how accurately can they portray the Triple Crown in a film?  Are they going to show old clips?  And Diane Lane, how would she do in playing the part of Penny Chenery?  So, many unknown factors with this film and that is where I have to give director Randall Wallace and cinematographer Dean Semler some amazing credit for what they were able to accomplish.

The amount of work, risk and challenge these two had along with their crew and their jockeys in recreating and constantly reshooting the racing sequence is amazing.  One can watch the featurette included on this Blu-ray release of how it was all done but even watching how it was shot and how close that camera was to the horses and the jockey, I'm really impressed!  Those were risky shots but they wanted to capture the feel of riding with those horses, especially feeling the speed of Secretariat.  Once, again...impressive!

Overall, ""Secretariat"" is a wonderful, feel-good movie.  One shouldn't expect anything significant as we know the outcome of the race but it relied in making us believe in these underdogs.  Penny Chenery facing the challenge of being away from her family and putting everything on the line in order to continue her father's legacy is very intriguing.  And sometimes when you have these stories of heroic or iconic athletes, you're used to the banality of these films and how one faces adversity and wins.  But to not become too banal, that it needs to stick out and go further than any feature film that featured horseracing (the last was the 2003  film ""Seabiscuit"").

Randall Wallace was able to successfully create a film that pays the ultimate homage to Secretariat and also getting things right with the story of Penny Chenery, even if he had to take liberties for the sake of entertainment, he didn't go astray too far and if anything, even the blunt Chenery paid her compliments in the special feature included in the Blu-ray release.

As for the film, I enjoyed it a lot.  Was there anything that I didn't like?  Possibly the music selection for when Secretariat was about to win the Belmont.  I would have liked to hear a more inspiring instrumental score versus a commercial pop song. It felt out of place.  But that's my opinion.

But there are not many things I can nitpick of the storyline.  I felt Diane Lane was incredible as Penny Chenery, John Malkovich also felt right playing the part of Lucien and everything else, from the screenplay to the cinematography worked smoothly.  ""Secretariat"" doesn't strive to become polemic, nor does it strive to be anything controversial.  This is a positive, spirit-lifting film.

Otherwise, I felt the movie was very good and possibly the best horse racing movie I have seen thus far.  If anything, ""Secretariat"" is a feel-good, enjoyable family film of one of the greatest moments in American culture.  I may have not been old enough to appreciate Secretariat's win at the time but watching this film, I do feel it paid a great homage to one of the great racing horses of all time but also giving a positive portrayal of Penny Chenery and the personal risks she took in making Secretariat's success a reality.  Also, a strong and courageous woman who took on a business which is typically seen as a man's world and for this Colorado housewife, she proved her detractors wrong and came out successful.

How awesome is that?

""Secretariat"" on Blu-ray is recommended!",1296259200,6,15212,4.755242089210827
4324044,5,B004C03TK2,"I'd seen the movie but wondered if owning the DVD version was worth the cost. It absolutely was! First of all, though, information about the movie: Diane Lane plays Penny Chenery (Tweedy), a woman willing to risk everything and face bankruptcy because of her faith in Secretariat. Her strength and determination make for an inspirational movie, particularly for those who love horses. Until she devoted her time to Secretariat, her primary role in life had been as a housewife. Now she had to take on a world dominated by men, the world of horse racing.

Even though many viewers may be familiar with Secretariat's history long before viewing the film, I didn't feel that detracted a bit from the movie. The characters are interesting, are more than one-dimensional and John Malkovich is superb as Lucien Laurin, Secretariat's trainer. He and Lane go head to head in some scenes, both of them stubborn and set in their views. Their goal? To train Secretariat to win the Triple Crown and  pay back investors in the horse. So much depends on every race.

Now for the DVD: I'd urge you to get it while you can. The extras are simply superb, with the real Penny Chenery and others who worked with Secretariat being interviewed. Happily, Chenery and Lane were able to work together during the making of the film and there is even a small cameo of the actual Penny Chenery in the movie. The bonus documentary, as far as I""m concerned, is well worth the cost of the DVD. But there is far more than that. Other extras include deleted scenes and a music video.

This is also a family movie, although it isn't likely to hold the interest of toddlers or very young children. It is one of those special movies which is equally entertaining for both adults and children. In fact I'd have gladly seen it without children along. It stands on its own as an accurate historical recreation of Secretariat's history, with plenty to keep adults enthralled.

Even though I'd witnessed the actual Triple Crown races where Secretariat ran for glory, I had forgotten - or never known - some of the details. As Diane Lane and the actual Penny Chenery pointed out, other horses who ran against Secretariat were often excellent. It was a bit sad that they had to run against such an extraordinary horse, one whose likes may never be seen again. In any other year, Sham (Secretariat's main contender) may have gotten all the fame. Chenery had great respect for Sham and felt that Sham was a gallant horse. It is also made clear in the film that both Secretariat and Sham seemed to recognize each other and feel a true rivalry -and perhaps an equal measure of respect -for each other.

It is relatively hard to find heartwarming movies for the whole family. This one is especially special because Secretariat had heart and courage beyond even what his owner expected. There is also a surprise revealed upon Secretariat's death - but I'll leave that for viewers to learn after watching the film (it is revealed in the extras).",1296259200,7,2996,4.708015267175573
4324045,4,B004C03TK2,"This is about a horse which is probably the greatest.  Record breaker in every triple crown race.
Something here about how everything coalesces owner, trainer and groomer.  This makes a team that makes the talent (the horse) even better.
If you have ever worked with a horse or trained a horse, you will enjoy this movie.  I'd also recommend that you watch the Belmont Race on YouTube and see what this horse did.
For others outside of racing, I think you would get an understanding of what a team can do and how to put together a team.  For those who are a member of a team, I think you can see the accomplishments of a member of a team.
For those outside of racing, I think you can see a little bit of what people admire about racing, a horse that does the spectacular.  Not all are Secretariats, but on a good day you can see a horse do something beyond their capabilities.",1296172800,,876,4.317073170731708
4324046,3,B004C03TK2,"Nothing can come close to going to YouTube and watching the 1973 Belmont Stakes and the real Secretariat, who in my opinion is the second greatest racehorse of that century. When I learned his story would be by Disney, my heart sank.  It's still sinking.  I'm sorry, but they guess this horse had a heart that weighed in at 22lbs.  A normal horse's heart is 8.5lbs.  Sham too, had a great heart--his weighed in at 18lbs.  So here is a story of two great hearts pitted against each other.  At the end when the two horses had their final legendary battle at the Belmont, if anything, we should have heard mixed in with the sound of thundering hooves--the rhythmic steady beat of that perfect machine beating in Big Red's chest.  A subtle tribute to his immense heart that made it possible for him to do the impossible.  Instead we had sappy annoying and offensive (to anyone who isn't a Christian) praise Jesus music as he pounded for home.  I'm sorry, it ruined the part of the film I was looking forward to most.  It killed it for me.  Now that I own the DVD I can at least mute the sound and not have to listen.  But I'm sorry, when I'm watching a movie about a great racehorse I had the luck to see run in 1973, the last thing I need is to have JESUS crammed down my throat.  It was out of place, it was jarring, it was offensive, AND it distracted me from his story.  Leave it to Disney to ruin what I have looked forward to seeing for years--HIS story, done right.  I wish it could have been done right. I wish it could have on par with Sea Biscuit.  Now THERE was a great film.  This one, lost it for me because of the stupid gospel music--and also because of the fact we had to watch the family cheering instead of getting to see his run at the Preakness--which was also a stunning race we barely got to see.  Was that real footage of the race on the TV?  If so, then what a great idea--but really I would have preferred to actually have seen the RACE, not the actors watching and clapping at the TV.",1296172800,,2006,4.217847769028872
4324047,5,B004C03TK2,"I saw this in the theatre when it came out last fall. Yes, there are some inaccurracies.  Call it Hollywood.  Those flaws do not lessen the impact of Secretariat's story in any way.  The coin flip was decided the year before Secretariat was born.  Ogden Phipp's did win the flip of the coin.  That left Mrs. Chenery with the Somethihngroyal foal of 1970 who of course turned out to be Secretariat.  She was not present at his birth, rather her father was.  I believe it was Ms. Ham who said ""whopper"" in regards to Secretariat.

It was Angle Light who won the Wood 3 weeks before the Derby.  I've read alot of people who said that Disney made it sound like Sham had won.  But if you listen closely to the call at the finish--the announcer says its Angle Light and Sham with Secretariat coming in third.  Yes, it was kind of awkward and for those not closely associated to this story you might be misled.

Overall I think Diane Lane brought Penny to life for a whole new generation of kids who don't don't this story.  Watch the credits and you will see Penny listed as the consultant.

One of Secretariat's grandkids actually played him in the movie.  It was shot at Churchhill Downs.  Disney really did do an outstanding job with this movie making it as true as they could--and still adding more Hollywood to a story that really didn't need it.

My biggest complaint with the dvd is the coloring.  It looks awful on my HD tv.  I had to adjust stuff cause leaving things at neutral leaves Secretariat's blinkers looking green.  They should look somewhere between medium and navy blue with chalk white on them--with the red coat of Secretariat.  Perhaps its just my copy or my tv.  It's simple to adjust.  Once you do you will immensely enjoy this movie even more.

A wonderful piece of history.  One that kids today should watch.  Kate Tweedy was into protesting Vietnam--that's a history lesson for middle schoolers!  Plus its family friendly, no bad words and no behaviour that would make parents think twice about letting their kids see.

Hollywood we need more great horse stories like this.  Ones that kids can learn from.  We desperately need family friendly movies that all can watch and not be worried about content.",1296172800,5,2224,4.599489795918367
4324048,5,B004C03TK2,"One of the best movies I have seen in a while, it follows Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) in pursuing her fathers horse ranch by putting all her stakes on one horse that would soon be a legend, Secretariat. The passing of her father drives Penny to square against ,lawyers, big business men, and her family to hold true to her fathers honor, and the horse was right there with her.

As far as the story line goes, it is hard to go wrong with one of the most riveting event in U.S. history, one that the whole nation followed, one that has set records that haven't even been approached to this day.

Even though you know it is fake, it is still exciting to watch a horse beat another record breaking horse by thirty one lengths, more exciting that a neck and neck race. truly an inspiring movie and John Malkovich was brilliant (as was the rest of the cast.)

4324051,5,B004C03TK2,"Okay, i loved this movie for many of the same reasons i loved the new True Grit...a long awaited return to ""real movies,"" story telling, dialogue, showcasing the plot and exceptional actor's craft of the Hollywood Classics! If the film industry is cyclic, like everything else, then Hallelujah...because we as an audience might be getting the BEST of films!

The story of a dark horse evolving into the most remarkable Triple Crown Winner in the history of racing drives the film with ease (as it should), Secretariat has been presented before, but this film brings out the period as if in a time machine.. The cast consists mainly of the impeccable Diane Lane, playing Penny Chenery, a woman of grace and resolve, finding herself in an unsettling position. She can either passively retreat to her 60's role as a dutiful housewife and mother, or take the reins of her family's legacy---- and nurture a wondrous horse as a contender for the Triple Crown.

Penny chooses to take the risks, much to the consternation of her family and the male dominated world or horse racing. She faces innumerable obstacles to her father's dreams but relies on her instincts to be true. John Malkovich is absolutely marvelous, playing the outrageous trainer, Lucien Laurin, whose wardrobe alone is dazzling in its outrageousness. His style and methods are not in sync with the racing set, making the whole sports miracle even more memorable. Another wonderfully warm supportive character is Margo Martindale, as Chenery's assistant, Miss Ham. The main character, (besides the horse, Big Red) is Ms. Chenery, a woman of quiet strengths and sincere resolve. Diane Lane hits her marks beautifully...a woman behaving unacceptably in this era, lacking family support, but holding faith with her band of misfits and maintaining poise, dignity and LOVE for a horse with more than heart. Their devotion to ""Big Red,"" an equine of questionable abilities in endurance, yet mystical possibilities and athletic prowess, proves that fairy tales do happen in real life...if you believe.

Secretariat was a sports phenomenon, unrivaled, and unbelievably powerful in the director's (Randall Wallace)depiction of this historical marvel. Sets, costumes, background, casting and photography were of sentimental brilliance presenting the nostalgia of the 60's, behind the scenes training and politicking in racing, the adrenaline laced excitement of the competition, to include the jockeys and their invaluable skill and bravery. The series of building events culminates in the viewer's emotional rapture of seeing the extraordinary arise within our midst, without explanation or logic. Magical!

This movie is fantastical, GREAT...OMG, Hollywood, please take note of the pattern. It, and others like it, are blowing away the mind numbing explosive, sex filled, profanity immersed, costly repetitions being made in the last couple decades. Thank goodness. Its about real folks, amazing events, a real tale of legend, miracles and jaw dropping awe.

4324052,5,B004C03TK2,"I was 10 years old in the spring of 1973, and I remember watching each leg of that year's Triple Crown with heart-pounding breathlessness.  My mother and I always watched the Triple Crown together; she is, was, and will always be a horse person.  But 1973 was special; even a 10 year old could tell that.  That big, beautiful red horse.  His distinct personality and clear intelligence.  And his absolute love of running and his will to win.  SECRETARIAT was clearly a very special horse.  The horse of a lifetime, the champion of a century.

This beautiful movie, SECRETARIAT, is the story of that magnificent red horse, and the very special people who knew him.  His owner, Penny Chenery, who knew he was special from the moment he was born; his trainer, Lucien Laurin, who just couldn't stay away; his jockey, Ronnie Turcotte, who knew how to let him run his race; his groom, Eddie Sweat, who knew what the horse was thinking; and wonderful Miss Ham, who took care of them all.  SECRETARIAT was born a champion, and these people believed in him from the very start, even when the rest of the racing world was against them.

SECRETARIAT is a stellar film, with an incredible story, an outstanding ensemble cast, gorgeous cinematography, and perfect chemistry, between both people and horses.  The racing scenes are amazing; I was on my feet cheering wildly for ""Big Red,"" as he was known.  I felt 10 years old again, magically transported back to that very special spring.  My heart pounded during every race, even though I knew every historic outcome.  And that final race, The Belmont, which set records that have yet to be broken, the race that this horse shouldn't have, couldn't have won, but oh so clearly did, and with such style and aplomb, is truly magnificent and left me in tears.

My husband and I truly loved SECRETARIAT; this film is now at the top of our list of all time favorites.  SECRETARIAT is the perfect film for families, sports fans, horse lovers, and, well, just about everyone!  Exciting and sentimental, beautiful and captivating, inspiring and heart-warming, SECRETARIAT should not be missed.  MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1295913600,6,2148,4.819672131147541
4324053,5,B004C03TK2,"While ""Secretariat"" won't win any awards for being 100% faithful to the story of Big Red and his owners, ""Secretariat"" manages to be powerful, corny, moving and just down right entertainment. ""Secretariat"" is from the old fashioned school of filmmaking where you actually get to root for the underdogs and see them win. A confession--I'm not much of a racing fan and I really enjoyed the movie which focuses on overcoming difficult odds to reach your goals.

Big Red (his real name)came from a family of winners but winners who had speed but not stamina. When housewife Penny Chenery (Diane Lane)inherits Meadow's Stables from her ailing father (Scott Glenn)she faces challenges immediately; Meadow's Stables is stumbling financially. She sticks to her decision against the wishes of her brother (Dylan Baker) and her husband (Dylan Walsh)to raise and race Big Red. She knows however that she needs a trainer as hungry to win as she is and picks Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich)who must overcome his own issues to successful train Big Red to go all the way to the Triple Crown.

Directed by Randall Wallace (writer of ""Braveheart"" and director of ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"")""Secretariat"" races by compressing the true story into an exciting two hours. Wallace gets the details of the 60's and early 70's right and the performances are all authentic feeling without any showiness.

The film looks quite nice in its Blu-ray debut. The film has nice detail and depth. Colors pop and the cinematography color scheme nicely suggests the time the film is set in (1968-1973).

The film comes with both the Blu-ray edition as well as a DVD and both versions have special features  (though not exactly the same ones) which include the following: ""Choregraphing the Race""; ""A Director's Inspiration and A Conversation with the Real Penny Chenery""; an audio commentary by the director; ""Secretariat Multi-Angle Simulation"" which allows you to relive a recreation of the breathtaking race from multiple angles. We also get 4 deleted scenes.

The DVD has a featurette on the making of the film entitled ""Heart of A Champion"". Three deleted scenes and a music video.

""Secretariat"" is entertaining if not entirely factual in relaying the story of a rare and talented race horse as well as the owner, trainer and rider who believed in him. Recommended.",1295827200,5,2358,5.015345268542199
4324054,5,B004C03TK2,"Just a product review for the BD fans. I think a few of the storyline gripes out there (and here at Amazon) get answered if you actually sit through all of these special features, albeit there are a few worth watching and a few worth skipping.

The sound and picture are as expected from a Disney BD with the only real shortcomings glaring though when they used certain cameras during quick-edits in the races. The sound is great and adds to the immersion experience they went for in the races. The supplements are time consuming, but will hopefully satisfy both the purists and general fans alike. The main menu brings up a description of each selection with a time stamp:

* Heart of a Champion, 14:45 minutes. A light biopic with interviews and not as much stock footage as I would have liked for it being about him. For those wanting a brief background on him or teachers wanting to show something off on this product - this is your best bet.
* Choreographing, 6:24 minutes. A quick ad plug for Semler and a all too-short description on the cameras and how they used them.
* Director interview with Penny, 21:10 minutes. The best supplement for the people wanting to know the human background and real story material. The director sits down with Penny and has a very candid conversation about the film and how things really happened. A nice empowerment piece for ladies, and she gives an interesting talk about how she looks at fear - it played well in the store.
* Audio Commentary/Director: To be honest, I got more from the interview in this case.
* Deleted scenes, 10:30 minutes. Director intro and optional commentary for the scenes. Having watched the film first, the optional opening takes away from how they did the closing of the movie - I prefer what is in the film and the scenes overall are not worth the watch.
* Music video with AJ Michalka. Not a well made video with the song, and even my 8-year old daughter mentioned how bad the ""lip-syncing"" looked. Skipper.
* Multi Angle Secretariat option, takes around an hour to get through it all. The big races shown in the film are recreated with animation from different angles depending on which person you select to narrate the ""experience"". You have the choice of hearing a jockey, a spectator, a historian, a sports writer and then the actual race footage. Each animation set after a talking head interview has period information scrolling by and simultaneously popping up on the bottom and top of the screen while his races are detailed. Time consuming and a little tedious with how the animation looks, but you get a great deal of material, and will probably only be interesting for hardcore fans of the horse and how he raced.
* Disc 2 =&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secretariat/dp/B004DK5CW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secretariat</a>.

When playing the film and you select the pop-up menu, it shrinks the film uninterrupted to a 20% screen and allows you to see all of the same supplement description as if at the main menu. The only glitch I came across (most likely my player) is if you select the Info option it does nothing except show the commentary disclaimer. The best crowd-pleaser supplement was her interview, teen girls liked the music video the most (I have never heard of this singer - guess I am out of it) and the young kids liked the cheesy animation features as it looked like a video game (which it gives you a website to visit and play a game).

Definite recommendation if you are considering buying it. Spanish, French and English 5.1 with a 2.0 Descriptive Track, which in a film like this almost competed with the play-by-play of the race commentator narration.",1295827200,3,3703,4.808477237048666

The truth is, all of us who happened to be alive on this planet when this famous horse made history in 1973, can still remember those days, even if some of us didn't have any interest whatsoever in horse racing. But, still, we cheered for him, and he was really a world-wide phenomenon, a legend in his own time. The splendid and captivating ""Secretariat"" captures this horse's magnificent achievement in glorious detail.

The film's narrative is straightforward, and it begins in Denver, in 1969, in the home of Penny Chenery (Diane Lane), Jack Tweedy (Dylan Walsh), and their children. This particular day, Penny receives a phone call, informing her about her mother's sudden death in Virginia. She immediately departs to her parent's ranch, in order that she can be with them, especially her father Chris (Scott Glenn), who is old and in bad health. He used to raise racing horses and Penny inherited his passion. Against her brother's and husband's will, who warned her that the family finances were in bad shape, she decides to keep the family business, and hires Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) to train the horses. About this time, too, Secretariat is born and shows promise for racing. Against all odds, and with her financial future at risk, Penny decides to take a chance with Secretariat (a.k.a. Big Red). The risk pays off, and Secretariat easily wins almost every race in the circuit, and gets the opportunity to compete for the prestigious Triple Crown.

Although Secretariat's history in the Triple Crown is well-known, director Randall Wallace does a great job in keeping the suspense going at all times. In addition, he also triumphs in portraying and comparing Penny Chenery's tenacity and attitude with that of Secretariat's. This is a story of will and character in the worst of times. The fascinating Blue-ray combo pack is loaded with extras, including how the races were choreographed, conversations with the real Penny Chenery, audio commentary by the director, deleted scenes, multi-angle simulations, and much more. Released January 25, 2011. (USA, 2010, color, 123 min plus additional materials).

She hires a trainer (Malkovich) and a jockey and sets out to make history.  I was not that excited to watch this movie.  The extent of my horse racing knowledge begins and ends with ""Seabiscuit"" (which I did like).  I went in expecting to see Seabiscuit 2.  This was much better.  I do know the history of Secretariat being the last horse to win the triple crown, but not how or what a long shot he was.

For one, Penny Chenery was not present at the birth of Secretariat.  For another, the movie makes you think she was thrown into the world of horses with Secretariat.  Not the case, she was into it before that.  Does anyone remember Riva Ridge, the horse she had the year before Secretariat?  He won the Kentucky Derby and The Belmont in 1972.  She loved Riva Ridge. Sham's owner was not the jerk that Disney made him out to be, and Lucien Laurin was not the colorful, outlandish person they made him out to be, either.  And filming Secretariat's Triple Crown - Belmont win at Keeneland had no comparison to Belmont Park which is huge.  And what was with the gospel song when he won it.  I wanted to be swept away with emotion when he won that race. It was such a monumental victory that one needed to cry tears of joy. Instead I got a gospel song.  Don't get me wrong; Keeneland is a beautiful racetrack, but it's not Belmont or even close.

4324062,4,B004C03TK2,"One of the hallmarks of great Disney movies is that they can take a timeworn tale and, through fine storytelling skills, draw you in to a degree that you worry that the outcome might be other than what you clearly know from the start. One of the best examples is Walt Disney's Cinderella. Will the mice get the key to the tower up the stairs so Cinderella can escape and try on the slipper before the Duke leaves? Oh no, it's broken! Now what?

Secretariat isn't a Disney movie on the level of Cinderella, but it's no less a fairy tale. Most already know the ending, but there is a lot of involvement in the journey to that fateful race. It's inspired by real people and events -- the real Penny Chenery Tweedy even has a cameo -- but the opposing horse owner's snarkiness is apparently exaggerated and there are the customary Hollywood changes to add to the drama.

Most folks won't be watching Secretariat for razor-sharp accuracy. Like my son, who knew nothing of this great horse's story yet was compelled by every second of the movie. It's pretty much the old-fashioned Hollywood never-say-die all-seems-lost saga that has clicked since Mickey Rooney was the number one star in the entire world (as he would tell you right now if he were in the room with you or anyone else).

Some compared Diane Lane's look to Pat Nixon, but there's more Mad Men's Betty Draper to her in my view. Her dubious yet loving spouse, played by Dylan Walsh, is straight out of the Jon Hamm ""bubble"" (see 30 Rock). But Lane does a creditable job with cool, quiet strength (she would have been a GREAT Hitchcock blonde). John Malkovich, always the focal point of any of his screen time, plays a crusty but benign (see Network) trainer. Like the film, he's very entertaining. My favorite is Margo Martindale, one of those actresses who can say volumes with her face and no dialogue -- and reminds me a little of Fran Ryan, that Hungry Jack biscuit commercial lady who also used to be on The Doris Day Show and Green Acres.

The film is gorgeously mounted, director Randall Wallace and his crew making the most of every inch of the screen space and the locations. But gee whizzies, if you don't have a Blu-Ray player and you'd like to hear his commentary, tough tomatoes, folks.

Blu-Ray is very nice, and a film like this really benefits from the enhanced visual and audio qualities that the format provides. Up until recently, consumers have had a choice. If they stuck with standard DVD, they might lose a few bonus features, but largely enjoy the same rights and privileges of those who have Blu-Ray.

Now the ""haves"" are being separated from the ""have nots."" Those who could not afford or simply did not want to switch to Blu-Ray were denied seeing Destino, Roy E. Disney's dream project, because it was left off the Fantasia/Fantasia 2000 standard DVDs.

Now the ""have nots"" cannot hear a director's commentary on Secretariat, a bonus feature that has nothing to do with a better picture or enhanced sound quality. They are being left out. They do not ""count."" It may be shrewd marketing, but this sort of thing is not very considerate to those who are still paying hard-earned and very tight money to buy home entertainment, regardless of the format.

On another note, Disney owes a debt of gratitude, at least in part, for Craig Ferguson's role in Secretariat's box office success. Ever since the film's release, he's featured a backhanded ""tribute"" on his late night talk show in which a pantomime horse dances to disco music every time the doorbell rings. It seems silly, but it's good promotional stuff. Ferguson's going to be the voice of Owl in the upcoming Winnie the Pooh feature. Good for him!",1294876800,4,3688,4.654377880184332

This was the first movie I have seen in about 2 years, and the first in a long time that I was excited about and truly wanted to see.  In 1973, Secretariat touched everyone in this country.  Just about everyone was talking about and rooting for this horse.  But, in addition to telling the story of a champion Triple Crown winning horse, this film tells the story of just how implausible the events behind the champion were.  While taking a few moments of dramatic license, it effectively tells the story of the background of this thoroughbred legend as was brilliantly laid out by William Nack, in SECRETARIAT, THE MAKING OF A CHAMPION.  I have heard about and read reviews that this was more Penny's story than Secretariat's story, maybe so, but the truth is, without Penny, there would be no Secretariat.  This is no different than SEABISCUIT, which was as much the story of the three individuals who brought immortality to that horse as well.  In short, this is a must see film, and is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable.  For once you can see a movie and feel good about what you have seen; the story of a horse with a tremendous heart nurtured on by people with the heart to believe.

4324105,4,B004C03TK2,"""Secretariat""
(Walt Disney, 2010)
-----------------------------
An enjoyable film about an epic horse, made as a true throwback to the corny, bio-pic storytelling of the 1940s and '50s. First off, I appreciated that this film was family-friendly enough that I could take my young child to see it: there aren't many in-theater movies these days that are suitable for young children, or worth the use of their braincells, but this was a good choice. The story of Secretariat, a remarkable horse who won the 1973 Triple Crown, is also the story of owner, Mrs. Penny Tweedy, who was a ""simple housewife"" who also happened to be a millionaire heiress (back in the '70s, when a million dollars still meant something!) Although the horse, physically speaking, was not an underdog, Ms. Tweedy was -- a woman competing in the boy's club confines of professional horse racing. The film's script pounds this home, touting her as a feminist standard-bearer during the heady era of the Vietnam War. The war is also touched on, lightly, as Ms. Tweedy's teenage daughter becomes politically active in the antiwar movement (painting flower-covered signs in rooms full of earnest extras who look like a retro-oriented episode of ""Glee"") but the hippie stuff is just period-piece background color, peripheral to the real story, which is a standard-issue sports triumph tale.

Intriguingly, the horse racing itself is minimized -- the training sequences are short, and most of what we learn about Secretariat's prowess comes from exposition, while the races themselves fly by all too quickly and are full of distractions, just like in real life. Indeed, the filmmakers show the second of the three big races, the Preakness, from the vantage point of Ms. Tweedy's distant family, watching it at home on a grainy, smeared-image '70s-era TV (an interesting narrative choice, and also one of the most effecting evocations of the era in the entire film.) What horse-racing we do see is absolutely thrilling, exhilarating, shot more or less from the horse's POV, with pummeling sound design full of thunderous hoofbeats and snorting breath. My heart was in my hands during each of the races, and any horse lover will enjoy these sequences. Also impressive are the '70s couture outfits worn by Ms. Tweedy (primly played by Diane Hall); although the period costuming and other recreation of the hippie era had some emotionally inauthentic moments, it was still a fun flick. Even John Malkovitch, who I frequently find unbearably pretentious, was relatively restrained here, and managed not to pull me out of the film too much. In short, this is a nice, uncomplicated feel-good sports/horse film, certainly worth seeing if you're looking for something in that department. (Axton)",1292112000,,2751,5.140625
4324106,5,B004C03TK2,"The movie ""Secretariat"" is based on the real life story of Penny Chenery, owner of the racehorse Secretariat, who won the Triple Crown in 1973.  Penny (played by Diane Lane) is a housewife and mother of four children. Her father (played by Scott Glenn) owns a horse racing farm that has been losing money for years. Although Penny grew up in horse ranching, she has allowed life and the times to define her as just a housewife and mother. When her mother suddenly dies and her father has a stroke, Penny is left with the decision to either sell the farm and continue with her life as it is, or gamble on running the horse ranch and changing the fortunes of the ranch and herself. Penny decides to bet the ranch on one horse named ""Big Red"" who she feels has the right stuff to win the triple crown.

Penny hires a very unorthodox trainer named Lucien Laurin (played by John Malkovich) and a demanding jockey Ron Turcotte (played by Otto Thorwarth) to train Big Red and all their efforts pay off as the horse is renamed Secretariat and starts to win race after race. But no one, save Penny, believes Secretariat has the intensity and stamina to win the Triple Crown. So she makes a performance guarantee to her investors that will cost her $6 million dollars if the horse fails to win.

Me with Secretariat movie producer Mark Ciardi
In true Disney fashion, ""Secretariat"" is a movie with a wonderful story and a brilliant acting cast.  Even though I knew how the story was going to end, the movie made my heart pound and left me breathless as I got caught up in the storyline. I was totally rooting for Penny as she fought against being typecasted as just a homemaker.  She showed that a woman can have the brains and the tenacity to build a business and run it as successfully as a man.  The movie also showed the courage that it takes to live life by your own terms.

Besides the great story, the movie cinematography was excellent. The horse racing scenes were out of this world exciting. The way the movie was shot, the audience is put at the level of the horse and rider and it gave me the sensation of being part of the race. ""Secretariat"" is simply beautiful and stunning to watch. The movie even contains actual footage from Secretariat's 1973 win in the Preakness Stakes. The cinematography is further enhanced by the music score, which contains moving African American gospel music.

Disney has a real winner in ""Secretariat"". The combination of a great story with great acting and wonderful cinematography makes this film the total winning package.",1292025600,3,2558,4.594298245614035
4324107,5,B004C03TK2,"Although it really wasn't true that Secretariat saved the farm, you cannot deny the amazing story of this animal. While at the Would Equestrian Games in Kentucky in October I saw an exhibit for Secretariat in one of the museums at the Kentucky Horse Park. It was courtesy of Disney, of course, and it not only heralded the upcoming movie, but what was going on in the early 70s with the protesting and unhappiness against the war in Vietnam. The people needed a hero, and Secretariat Was that hero. The movie is extremely well done, and has an excellent cast. When my friend and I saw it in the movies, people who probably knew nothing about horse racing were cheering for Secretariat as he blew the field away at the Belmont. I had the pleasure to meet Kate Chenery at the WEG, and she assured me that I would not be disappointed with the movie. Actually, no one else would be, either...

He could spot a camera as quickly as a carrot and enjoyed posing for pictures. He loved people and connected with them.

My daughter and I went to see this movie 3 times, and we cried with tears of pride each time.

4324110,5,B004C03TK2,"SECRETARIAT is a great horse movie because of the way the horses who portray Secretariat interact with the cast members.  In other horse movies, like SEABISCUIT, the horses are just there.  In SECRETARIAT there was an obvious connection between the humans and equines.  (We have four horses and I know how that interaction works.)  The horse racing scenes are well done, too.  Equally important is Lane's portrayal of Secretariat's owner, who was instrumental in making Secretariat's career possible.  That horse was the most charismatic race horse there ever was, and on days when he was feeling well, no other horse could touch him.  One could build a case that he had an excuse for every race he lost.  His Kentucky Derby and especially his Belmont Stakes make him immortal in the annals of racing.

4324125,4,B004C03TK2,"Disney Studios always put their curious ""joyfull"" stamp on their family movies and Secretariat is no exception. If they have to re-write history a bit; they do. Horse-lovers know the real story and, of course, know the ending. It's just the ""getting there"" that takes a bit of suspension of belief.
We are told that the farm is in desperate financial straits though Riva Ridge who won the 1972 Derby for Mrs. Tweedy is NEVER mentioned even though he was still racing in 1973. Secretariat was never an underdog. He won Horse of the Year as a 2-year-old! Secretariat lost his last Derby prep to Angle Light though the film implies that Sham was the winner and that noble horse's trainer, Frank Martin; was portrayed as a big-mouthed villain...which he was not. He was simply the trainer of the second-best horse of 1973.
To the film's credit, the racing scenes are superb. The Preakness (jewel #2 in the Triple Crown) was shown as it took place on TV. I have no complaint with that as Big Red's stunning move on the first turn could not likely be duplicated.
Mrs. Tweedy's turn as ""horse-whisperer"" was sheer nonsense...but what the heck; this is not a biography.
Secretariat's final stretch run in The Belmont Stakes was treated very cleverly from a cinematic point of view but the musical choice of a Biblical version of ""Oh Happy Day"" defies description. It makes no sense at all.
For all its historical faults, flights of pure imaginiation; Secretariat is a most enjoyable film. The good guys win; the bad guys lose.

4324130,4,B004C03TK2,"""Secretariat""
(Walt Disney, 2010)
-----------------------------
An enjoyable film about an epic horse, made as a true throwback to the corny, bio-pic storytelling of the 1940s and '50s.  First off, I appreciated that this film was family-friendly enough that I could take my young child to see it: there aren't many in-theater movies these days that are suitable for young children, or worth the use of their braincells, but this was a good choice.  The story of Secretariat, a remarkable horse who won the 1973 Triple Crown, is also the story of owner, Mrs. Penny Tweedy, who was a ""simple housewife"" who also happened to be a millionaire heiress (back in the '70s, when a million dollars still meant something!)  Although the horse, physically speaking, was not an underdog, Ms. Tweedy was -- a woman competing in the boy's club confines of professional horse racing.  The film's script pounds this home, touting her as a feminist standard-bearer during the heady era of the Vietnam War.  The war is also touched on, lightly, as Ms. Tweedy's teenage daughter becomes socially active in the antiwar movement (painting flower-covered signs in rooms full of earnest extras who look like a retro-oriented episode of ""Glee"") but the hippie stuff is just period-piece background color, peripheral to the real story, which is a standard-issue sports triumph tale.

Intriguingly, the horse racing itself is minimized -- the training sequences are short, and most of what we learn about Secretariat's prowess comes from exposition, while the races themselves fly by all too quickly and are full of distractions, just like in real life.  Indeed, the filmmakers show the second of the three big races, the Preakness, from the vantage point of Ms. Tweedy's distant family, watching it at home on a grainy, smeared-image '70s-era TV (an interesting narrative choice, and also one of the most effecting evocations of the era in the entire film.  What horse-racing we do see is purely thrilling, exhilarating, shot more or less from the horse's POV, with pummeling sound design full of thunderous hoofbeats and snorting breath. My heart was in my hands during each of the races, and any horse lover will enjoy these sequences. Also impressive are the '70s couture outfits worn by Ms. Tweedy (primly played by Diane Hall); although the period costuming and other recreation of the hippie era had some emotionally inauthentic moments, it was still a fun flick.  Even John Malkovitch, who I frequently find unbearably pretentious, was relatively restrained here, and managed not to pull me out of the film too much.  In short, this is a nice, uncomplicated feel-good sports/horse film, certainly worth seeing if you're looking for something in that department. (Axton)",1289088000,,2752,5.122767857142857

Even, like those of us who have lived long enough to remember the Secretariat races,Triple Crown win...even knowing race outcomes, the suspense and seat-edge stance is there. My wife cheered and high-fived the air...really. My heart pounded with every hoof beat. Really. I could taste mud flying off the hooves like a jockey.

Also, I, a grown man, age 62, almost cried (in the dark) at some of the most tender moments. This story is about relationships. It's not about getting rich from racing horses, or betting on them. It's about living on the edge, living with conviction, standing up against odds, and racing ahead with courage coupled with that inner feeling of challenge. You will fall in love with Penny (Diane Lane), the gal that saves the farm. You'll empathize with Lucien (John Malkovich) the trainer, a past failure.

You will laugh out loud (especially at press conferences when Penny is so cool), weep, jump, cheer, love, and just about every other emotion that a movie can produce.

I'm not a horse lover nor a hater. Actually I'm afraid of the real big ones. But horse lovers, I'm sure, will find this even better than my 5-star rating. It does show some beautiful animals.

I am glad I was proved wrong, as both stories, though centering on amazing horses, are also quite different.

Secretariat is the story of an amazing horse and its even more amazing owner. Housewife and mother of four Penny Chenery (Diane Lane in a spirited performance, one of her career's best), returns home to attend her mother's funeral and finds her ailing father (Scott Glenn) in really bad shape. She decides to stay on and help stabilize her father's horse business, Meadow Stables, and when she finds out the trainer is committing fraud, she promptly fires him. Penny's husband Jack (Dylan Walsh) is not too thrilled that his wife is taking on this responsibility, and neither is Penny's brother Hollis (Dylan Baker) a Harvard professor of economics who thinks it makes more financial sense to sell the business.

Penny decides that she will manage the horse farm, commuting between Virginia and her home back in Denver. Well, to cut a long story short, Penny Chevery not only manages to do that, she also manages, with the aid of horse trainer Lucien Laurin (the always entertaining John Malkovich), jockey Ronnie Turcotte (Otto Thorwath), groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis), and of course loyal secretary Miss Ham (Margo Martindale) to create racing history by producing a champion of champions, Secretariat or Big Red as he was fondly called - a horse so amazing that his record in the Triple Crown back in 1973 has yet to be bested.

This movie is not just a horse movie - it is a perfect confluence of all that makes a hit movie, i.e. consummate storytelling, an incredible ensemble cast led by Diane Lane, flawless cinematography (the horse races were so well choreographed and edited that I felt like I was there during each race, cheering Secretariat on), and a well-written script. This is as much a movie about the horse, Secretariat, as it is a story about the amazing woman whose relentless determination gave the world this champion. Penny Chenery broke out from the typical housewife mold, and proved to the men in the horse business that she was someone to contend with, and earned respect and admiration in the process.

Note to parents considering this movie for young children: We took our five-and-a-half year old daughter (who happens to love horses) to see this movie, and there's nothing that we found offensive. The language is clean, there are no scenes of a sexual nature, and it is just a great family-friendly drama.

If you root for the underdog, this is your movie. If you love history, this is your movie.

He made believers out of non-believers and became a household name by doing what few horses can achieve,winning the Triple Crown. None of his offspring were running champions like he was, but many were stellar show horses.

Can't wait to get it!,1287273600,2,335,3.8
4324140,4,B004C03TK2,"All right, first off, let me say this:

It's great for the family: clean, inspiring, and has great morals. No foul language, sex, or drugs which is so prevalent in modern movies. I have to say, why can't people make more films like this?? Take an amazing, TRUE story, after all, there are legends in history that are real!

The actors did fantastic work in their roles; Diane Lane (as Penny Chenery) embodies the intelligent wit and spirit that so few women display in acting nowadays. I hope we see more of her in future films, gracing the screen with her elegance and beauty. I loved John Malkovich as Lucien Laurin; he was brilliantly quirky and eccentric (with an array of colourful hats) and provided some great lines throughout the film.

The first half hour was good. It was really good. It set up the story, characters, and the story in general. It flowed very well, with a good pace. The family scenes are fantastic, you feel as if you're right there watching them.
But then after Secretariat is born, there's a 2-year jump in the film that takes place in less than 2 minutes. It left me going, ""What?"" and I wished there'd been some sort of montage in between. But you actually don't ever see much of Secretariat. It constantly focuses on Penny Chenery but it doesn't really resolve what taking place between her and her family. Is her husband raising the kids? Is she living at her father's breeding farm? It's hard to tell because it is not clear.

I've known the story of Secretariat since I was young, so I was quite excited for this film. (People need to make more horse films) But I felt like we didn't even get to know this great horse, even though the characters in the film knew that he was great.

We constantly hear, ""Secratariat is going to win"" and ""he loves to race"" but we never SEE it. In fact, it concentrates so much on Penny Chenery's fight to win these races that we never really see much of the famed racehorse. Seeing as this movie is about Secretariat and bears the movie title after him, you'd think there would actually be scenes with the horse in it.

Now, this may just be me, but actually the editing during the races began to bother me. It was trying to be intense, and almost worked for me a couple times, but it kept cutting back to the opposing racehorse trainer at the end, and zooming up to his expressions right when it was meant to be a very powerful moment. It annoyed me. Everytime I wanted a nice seg-way/transition, or simply a peace moment, it almost never happened, or was too short. It's almost like he's viewed as a racing machine. I believe the sole moment of quiet with Secretariat was a brief shot showing his silhouette at sunset in the field. I craved more, but never got it.

As far as racehorse movies go, ""Seabiscuit"" is better. It is well-rounded and really tells the story well while actually involving Seabiscuit, and the owner/trainer/jockey relationship. The high stakes just feel, well, more ""high"". The ending race is a LOT better than ""Secretariat""'s, because it focuses 100% on Seabiscuit while ""Secretariat"" bursts into a feel-good song at the end and tries to be super dramatic before that.

""Phar Lap"" is another good movie, the underdog Australian racehorse who was too amazing for the world to comprehend (it ends tragically though, be forewarned).

""Secretariat"" felt like one big, dangerous gamble without showing how this amazing horse was inspiring. And it certainly did not feel like an underdog. It's like trying very hard to get an Oscar nod, and yes, it has heart, but not enough heart of Secretariat.",1287273600,3,3585,4.615384615384615

Even those who know the tale will warm to this well-crafted homage to arguably one of the great horses of modern track history.

Big Red sported a life worthy of the silver screen, uninhibited by media while spoiling for the next race.

W.C. Fields warned never to make movies with kids or animals.  But even W.C. was known to miss the bottle on occasion, though admittedly not often.

Seasoned casting brings together an ensemble that loops the audience into the reality of life being invaded by life.

A fast movie about a fast horse in a life quicker than a weaver's shuttle.  Don't blink.  You'll lose it.  Then you'll miss one of life's greatest joys, the pleasure of great company.

4324142,4,B004C03TK2,"Denver housewife Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) takes over her father's horse racing empire when he falls ill, commuting to Virginia to take care of the farm. Having grown up in the racing world, she knows about bloodlines and invests all her efforts in young Big Red, soon to be renamed Secretariat. She hires a good, but retired trainer (John Malkovich) and soon the horse is headed for the Triple Crown.

Secretariat was arguably the best race horse ever and deserved a good movie. And while the movie is good, it isn't great because Penny is the focus and the ""Don't call me a housewife!"" mantra gets old fast.  Her success shouldn't have surprised anyone since she grew up in the horse business. She didn't have a personal, loving relationship with the horse; he was merely a meal ticket. The movie's excitement comes from Secretariat's races, which are filmed with heart-stopping intensity. The final race of the film has got to be the Most Exciting Horse Race Ever.

For the most part, this movie lived up to my expectations, and I agree with most of what has been said by previous reviewers. However, there were two things that kept it from being as good as I had hoped - perhaps minor, but it took away the fifth star for this review. First, why, oh why, did they have the crowd singing ""My Old Kentucky Home"" at the Derby when the horses were still in the paddock ?! Anyone who has ever seen the Kentucky Derby knows that this song comes when the horses are in the post parade ! Perhaps a small detail, but it took me right out of the ""aura"" of the story for a while. Secondly, and again an issue with the score, I found the religious song (Oh Happy Day) to be a ridiculous way to highlight his amazing performance at the Belmont. Yes, I know it was a reference to the earlier scene when his groom was washing him, but I just don't associate Jesus with the running of a horse race ! I was not offended as a religious person, but as a secular one. Please keep Christianity out of a movie that has had NO references to that religion. The use of it in the finale made it sound like Secretariat was a born-again Christian horse. It would have been more effective if they had just used the music and not the singing.

4324176,4,B004C03TK2,"I know how movies like this are supposed to work, and this time, it doesn't bother me one bit. ""Secretariat,"" in the tradition of recent films like ""The Blind Side,"" ""Invictus,"" and ""The Longshots,"" adapts a true story into a reliable but successful inspirational sports drama. I admit that I knew nothing of the real Secretariat before seeing ads for the film, and I still know nothing about horseracing. However, I do know a good movie when I see one (although many have suggested otherwise). ""Secretariat"" is, indeed, a good movie, full of excitement and hope, brimming with enthusiasm, steadfast in its declaration that good things can happen as long as we have faith in ourselves and the people around us. Perhaps this is a bit idealistic, but since when has that been a bad thing? Sometimes, we actively seek movies like this, movies that can reinvigorate the idealist in us all.

Secretariat, for those of you who don't know, was an American thoroughbred racehorse who in 1973 made history by becoming the first U.S. Triple Crown winner in twenty-five years. He also set new race records by completing the Kentucky Derby in 1:59 and the Belmont Stakes in 2:24 - records that, to this day, have not been broken. The film, suggested by William Nack's book ""Secretariat: The Making of a Champion,"" does a wonderful job not only of depicting both races, but also of dramatizing the struggle to make his achievements possible. At the center of this struggle was housewife and mother Penney Chenery, who in the late 1960s took control of her ill father's horse breeding ranch in Virginia, which was suffering financially. It was there that Secretariat was born in the spring of 1969.

Chenery is portrayed in the film by Diane Lane as a determined, intelligent woman who trusts her instincts so deeply, it's almost as if the word ""doubt"" has absolutely no meaning. After refusing to sell her father's farm, much to the chagrin of her faithless brother (Dylan Baker), she participates in a coin toss with millionaire Ogden Phipps (James Cromwell), which would determine who would have first choice over the farm's two pregnant mares; technically speaking, she loses, although she's left with the mare she wanted, so in fact, she wins. No one other than her believed her mare would give birth to a quality racehorse, considering the parentage. When the colt is born, however, it's obvious that there's something special about him - he stands and begins walking faster than anyone working for the farm had ever seen.

The film does a good job conveying the sheer magnetism of Secretariat. Physically, he looks no different from any other horse. And yet, when the camera goes in for a close up of his face, his eyes gleam with passion and energy. Everyone around him senses it, including his groom, Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis), who in real life spent more time with Secretariat than with any other human being. In due time, Chenery is able to convince a retired trainer named Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) to give up spending the rest of his days playing golf; he too sees something special in Secretariat. Laurin is an eccentric man - moody and demanding, with a wardrobe that suggests he may have gone colorblind at some point in his life.

What the film never adequately addresses is Chenery's balancing act between her farm life and her relationship with her family. According to what we're shown, she essentially abandons her husband, a lawyer named John Tweedy (Dylan Walsh), and her four children, the oldest a teenager named Kate (Amanda Michalka), who in the turmoil of the early 1970s became a liberal activist, in part, I suspect, to rebel against the old fashioned beliefs of her father. While Chenery generally seems to miss her family - she often cries whenever she speaks to them on the phone - it's never made explicitly clear why she found Secretariat and his racing career more worthy of her attention. I would have appreciated a more thorough examination of this aspect of her life.

Despite this, we find that Kate is actually inspired by her mother's determination, and by the end, she will become her most vocal supporter. Indeed, many scenes with Chenery are no less than inspirational. Some of the best are reserved for pre-race press conferences, where Chenery and her opponent Pancho Martin (Nestor Serrano) trade verbal jabs, his angrier and more direct, hers quieter and more underhanded. There's no need for her to be hostile. She knows Secretariat is a winner. There's a scene later in the film, for example, when she asks to have a moment alone with the horse; when Sweat and Laurin step aside, Chenery and Secretariat face each other without saying anything for a few seconds, after which she quietly but confidently says, ""Okay then. See you in the morning.""

Little moments like this, moments that underscore Chenery's strength of character, are what make ""Secretariat"" such a pleasant movie, more so, in my opinion, than the racing sequences. I will not say that this is one of the year's best films, for while it is hugely entertaining, it also does little more than follow a very well established formula. That being said, it follows its formula very well, giving audiences every reason to cheer once the credits start to roll. In addition, the performances are wonderful; I'm fairly certain Diane Lane in particular will be considered for an award or two come springtime. If it worked for Sandra Bullock, it could work for her too.",1287014400,4,5466,4.865735767991407
4324177,5,B004C03TK2,"Diane Lane is tough and tender as housewife/thoroughbred owner Penny Chenery in ""Secretariat."" John Malkovich overflows his role as crusty trainer Lucien Laurin. The supporting actors and actresses are strong as well. The casting director deserves an Oscar and a stakes race named after him/her for collecting this group. A horse race can be won or lost at various points but it's clear ""Secretariat"" the movie was won at the casting gate.
 Chenery (Lane) uses a double tragedy to dig her heels into the family business. Her inspirational story is one that our dispirited nation can and should benefit from. Penny's perseverance creates the atmosphere for the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. Yet she never gets puffed up. Penny's graceful, spartan rhetoric leaves rival trainer Pancho Martin stewing in his boasts.
 Secretariat's 31-length victory in the 1973 Belmont Stakes is not the climax of the film. That actually comes in the quiet moment the night before the race when Penny tells the champ - ""I've won my race. Now you run yours."" Which he, of course, does.
 Lane and Emma Thompson have done more to return the dignity of women to the big screen than any other contemporary actresses. They are the Joan Crawford and Ingrid Bergman of our day.
 Few people would think of a Triple Crown winner as an underdog but the script hits the right (some might say misleading) notes, creating a Seabiscuit aura. We're reminded that Secretariat was a Virginia-bred, competing against the products of the big Kentucky farms (although the impression that Meadow Farm was on its last legs seems odd given that it nearly won the Triple Crown with Laurin-trained Riva Ridge the year before Secretariat accomplished the feat). Big Red lost three races on the big stage in New York City, including the Wood Memorial. Secretariat, even with that other worldly stride (visit Belmont Park's paddock and marvel at the stride immortalized in statue), had to struggle for his success.
Penny's moral whip keeps the team from coming apart, reminding us that leaders are necessary but teams are what win. That reality combined with raw talent writes the sports record books (evidence: Secretariat breaks Northern Dancer's Kentucky Derby record 2:00 time).
The Vietnam War is in the backdrop of the film. We can only speculate as to what a super horse nicknamed Big Red did to Cold War psyches at the White House and Pentagon (imagine if his name had been General Secretary). The U.S. cleared out of Vietnam two years after Secretariat won the Triple Crown. Coincidence? Perhaps. But here's hoping a horse named Afghan Hound or Lion of Baghdad breaks the current Triple Crown drought (1978 and counting) and gets us out of today's quagmires.
Lane, Malkovich and Co. (including former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson playing Claiborne Farm's Bull Hancock) need not make any overt political statements. The understated drivenness of the movie speaks volumes. Forty years after the birth of the great champion, a moving film memorial worthy of him has finally been created.",1286841600,28,3056,5.033596837944664
4324178,5,B004C03TK2,"Loved the movie - even though I knew the ultimate outcome there were still surprises and things I did not know.  Great photography and angles.
Excellent acting - loved the 60s genre and the strong, educated woman Diane Lane potrays.  Great family film too - devoid of the usual offensive sex, drugs, profanity, and violence.
I'm going to see it again in the theatre and will get the DVD - it's a keeper.",1286841600,,403,4.506849315068493
4324179,5,B004C03TK2,"I am old enough to remember when Secretariat raced at Arlington Park in Chicago and the how excited everyone was over this unbelievable horse that literally ran away with the Belmont.
Go see it. Take the kids. Take the grandkids. If you have no one to take, go by yourself. It does this great horse and owner proud, as well as the actors who portray them.  Bravo!",1286755200,,363,4.417910447761194

4324182,5,B004C03TK2,"Many of the reviews said it was overbearing, dull but don't believe it. ""Secretariat"" was entertaining and inspiring from beginning to end.
 It brought back many memories from the horse's victories. Being from NY, I especially enjoyed the scenes from Belmont Park.
Even though ""Secretariat"" is classified as a ""family"" movie, it is not just a movie for kids. Adults will enjoy it as much, if not more, than children.
It was also a nice change from the current crop of movies that are made for shock value or without any semblance of a  story.
 I can't wait to see ""Secretariat"" again.",1286755200,132,584,4.705882352941177

8422617,5,B004C03TK2,"What an inspiring movie. Secretariat hits all of the feel-good-buttons, strong, determined woman who is out to save her parents legacy--horses--a down and out trainer who finally finds redemption--horses--a groom who can feel into the soul of a horse--horses--cute kids who appreciate their mother--horses--exciting races and a true story to boot.

Diane Lane is wonderful as the woman who somehow knew that the mare counts as much as the sire in the quality of a race horse. She takes on the old boy's network or rich race horse owners, and does something that had never been done, because she believed in herself and believed in her horse.
I read up on Secretariat and found out about a theory called the x-factor in race horses. Secretariat's heart weighed in at 22 pounds compared to the 8-9 pounds of a normal horse's heart(it was done after the horse had died of course)--which meant that Secretariat had speed because of his wonderfully perfect body, and also stamina because his giant heart could pump more oxygen to his body, giving him incredible stamina which was seen when he ran the Belmont and not only set a new record for speed, but beat the rest of the pack by 31 lengths.
I also like to think that it's 'heart' that makes greatness, and Secretariat was great because of his heart, and was able to fulfill his destiny because of the woman who believed in him.",1528329600,,1376,4.733333333333333
