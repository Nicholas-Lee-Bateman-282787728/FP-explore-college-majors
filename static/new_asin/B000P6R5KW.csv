Volume: DVD 4
Running time: 100
Not a day goes by at Miyagami Academy where the students of the ""maximum authority-wielding"" Best Student Council don't learn something new, especially about each other. There are undercover agents from outside the school investigating what goes on inside. Crazy! Covert Squad members (and some annoying wannabes) keeping tabs on off-campus antics. Sneaky! And one student who just flat out lies to her own mother, which causes all kinds of problems. Let's not forget the teachers. They seem to be just as big of a mess as their students.
