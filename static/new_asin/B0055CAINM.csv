8457803,2,B0055CAINM,"The entire exercise portion is shot on a beach.  Sunshine sits on a stool and does the exercises in front of the rolling surf.  She never speaks.  A narrator reads the instructions.  Words like ""breathe"" appear on the screen. Very little instructions are given for how to set up the resistance bands and body parts and very little time.  The viewer needs to rush a bit to catch up to the action.
The camera is static, and there are strange transitions between each set of exercises (looks like a cube turning or pages fluttering...)
The workout is fairly effective, once you pick up the rhythm and get set with the movements.
After the workout, there is a period of film showing nature scenes, underwater scenes for relaxation.  I skip over these, as this is not what I'm looking for.
Bottom line:  I have a lot of exercise DVDs.  I'll use this one on occasion, but it won't be my first choice on any given day.",1408406400,,911,4.4787878787878785
