8557700,1,B00ATTHA9G,"I've seen a lot of remarks calling Ralph Paul's Guitar made easy course a fraud and a rip-off. However I don't see much about why they consider this to be the case. So, I decided to inform people why I, along with several others, warn consumers to stay away from Ralph Paul.

As soon as I see it on TV I basically knew it wasn't worth wasting one's money or time on. My brother, who is mentally impaired ordered Ralph Paul's course. They sent, and charged him for two complete sets even though he did not order two sets. When my mother found out about it she attempted to contact customer service with no avail!!! they ended up just accepting the fact they got ripped off. Any way, my brother sent me an entire copy of this so called guitar made easy course. The following is just a short synopsis of the many problems this course has;

1. An awful lot of folks are being double and even triple charged for this course and then entering a nightmare in an effort to get refunded.

2. Ralph Paul is not a guitar legend, no ones even heard of him until his infomercial.

3. Upon viewing his course material it is apparent that he really doesn't even play a guitar that good. Any experienced guitar player can immediately pick up the boat load of mistakes he makes. He seems to have a hard time playing a riff the same way twice. On one occasion I noticed that he played one riff four different ways,, all the while trying to teach the viewer to play it a certain way. This can cause some real confusion. He never teaches how to finish a riff. He only shows how to play a couple of strings of the riff, Then he demonstrates a way to complete the entire riff at a very fast speed which makes it impossible to catch what he is doing even if you slow down the DVD. When he does play at a fast speed it's obvious that he's playing faster than his ability to do so correctly.  If he slows down in an effort to show finger/fret placement he forgets where he is and ends up leaving out parts of the riff, and doesn't get back to correcting it. Even his strumming patterns are a mess. He doesn't keep in time and it's very obvious that he has a hard time demonstrating strumming patterns unless he's doing it at full speed.

4. during one segment when demonstrating the beginning of a country riff, he pauses to say words to the effect of; "" Now you might be saying Ralph when I play it, it doesn't sound as good as when you play it"". Ralph then goes on to say something to the effect of "" You have to give me credit because I've been playing since 1960"". His length of time playing has nothing to do with how his riff's sound. What he doesn't tell you is, his guitar is different, his strings may be different, his guitar pick up's may be different, and he doesn't tell you what amp or amp settings he's using, all of which can make it sound different. Now, it's not that your guitar will sound bad, it will just sound different. If you had the exact same set up as Ralph Paul used and you practiced this same riff every day, it wouldn't be very long and you would sound every bit a good if not better than Ralph Paul. I guarantee that it would not take you 50 some years to be able to sound good.

5. Read his arbitration agreement. In it he tells you that upon purchasing his product you agree to hold him and his affiliates harmless for fraud, misleading or violating any statutes, etc. which to me clearly states that he knows his product is a rip off.

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to just how bad this Guitar Made Easy course really is. In the first place, any Good course will come with written material containing notations and tabs which allows one to follow along with the DVD. Buyer Beware, This course is JUNK. Ralph Paul is NOT a good guitar instructor. Don't waste you money, this course is not worth your time or the aggravation it will cause you. Do your research, there's a lot of good guitar courses to be had, But Ralph's is just NOT one of them.",1421366400,,3975,4.2348284960422165

The sound quality is great, the video clarity is HD, the instructions easy to follow.  I was playing guitar in 30 minutes and I never even picked up a guitar before playing these dvds.  Now 3 months later I actually feel like I know what I am doing thanks to this dvd set.  Ralph Paul starts off from scratch on how to hold a pick, how to hold the guitar and adjust the strap, how to play chords, adjust the strings to get the guitar in tune.  Exactly what I was looking for in a teach me how to play guitar dvd lesson.  I priced out person to person lessons and they were $60 an hour.  This dvd set is your at home when ever you want teacher for a fraction of the price of guitar lessons.

8557706,1,B00ATTHA9G,"I hate doing stuff like this. Ralph Paul Acerno is probably a nice enough guy, but I must call him out on the untruths stated in his commercial. If this was ""Beginner Guitar Made Easy"" I'd say more power to him. But he is marketing this like ""You Can Learn Guitar in 5 minutes!!!... Legendary Guitarist!!!...America's Best Teacher!!....Teachers are Expensive....blah blah blah""

Fact Check Time...

1. You can't learn guitar in 5 minutes. Like anything else worth doing, it takes time, practice, and dedication...
2. He's not a legend.
3. He's not Amerca's Best Guitar Teacher...there's no award for that...
4. Teachers are a bargain. They keep your kids off drugs, off the street, and in school.",1369180800,12,696,4.94017094017094
