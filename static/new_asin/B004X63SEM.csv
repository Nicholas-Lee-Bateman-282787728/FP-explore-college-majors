4492142,5,B004X63SEM,"A young Lee Marvin stars as a squad sergeant in WW II France. Unwilling to leave one of his men trapped by an enemy machine gun nest, Marvin cajoles, badgers, and orders the other 6 men of his squad to wait until dark before attempting a rescue. But then orders from higher up derail his plan.
Wounded in WW II during the battle of Saipan, U.S. Marine Marvin  and fellow veterans B-24 navigator Arthur Franz, sailor Richard Kiley, and soldier Barney Phillips gave natural portrayals and inspired realistic performances out of the cast.",1369612800,8,535,4.752688172043011
4492143,5,B004X63SEM,"I saw this movie when I was young and wanted to see it again.  Amazon came up with the movie when no one else could, not Neflex not anyone.  This is a movie of infantry troops, mostly draftees, in an impossible situation, the living conditions and problems of soldiers int he field are shown here with a great deal of reality.  I was an infantry soldier and this is what it was like.  Andy",1308441600,23,389,4.216216216216216

4492167,5,B004X63SEM,"Contains the best sexual fantasy video I have ever seen.

As others have mentioned, this is a different kind of war movie.  There is an interesting sequence when one of the soldiers starts to describe his vision of a perfect world when the war is over and he returns to America.

In this fantasy, he is walking down a busy city sidewalk.  Everyone in the city is going about their business and is a beautiful woman in her 20s.  A painter, police officer, mail carrier, plumber, and everyone else in the city is a beautiful woman.  Moreover, each of these women are very desirous of him.  The whole scene would be rated G.  Nevertheless, it's every man's dream, shown accurately, in this fantasy sequence.

Other than the three-minute scene described above, the movie depicts the grim realities of war.  Very well acted, the settings and location are 100% convincing.",1432771200,2,866,4.751677852348993

4492173,5,B004X63SEM,"A classic war comedy-drama based on Harry Brown's short-lived Broadway play, ""A Sound Of Hunting"", which had starred Burt Lancaster.  The film concerns a squad of G.I's, somewhere in Italy during the Second World War,  who face the nerve-wracking strain of knowing that a member of their EIGHT (IRON) MEN squad is lying wounded not far from their billet, and they are refused permission to rescue him.  And they are also unsure of whether this wounded man is alive-or-dead.  The ending will SURPRISE nearly everyone.  This is a No-Frills dvd from the WARNER ARCHIVES series, so expect no extras.  However, this film is STILL in good-condition.  Enjoy !",1416009600,2,652,4.981481481481482

8446124,4,B004X63SEM,"Though they spend most of their time arguing and joking in a make-shift barracks, the tension slowly builds as a platoon is waiting for orders on what to do for a comrade who is trapped in a fox hole facing a heavy German machine gun.  The actors, many of whom became successful character actors in the 1960s, are very very good.  This is a must-see for WWII aficionados, a variation on the brave dude theme.  It has a surprise ending and the reaction is unexpected.  Recommended.",1506470400,,480,4.546511627906977
