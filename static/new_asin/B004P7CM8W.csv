8437495,5,B004P7CM8W,"Both great movies, the third is my FAVORITE movie! I love the Hordika versions of the Toa. I'd have to say 3rd is my favorite, the one with Mata Nui is my second favorite, Bionicle 2 is my third, and the first is my fourth favorite. Don't get me wrong, I love them all! They all offer great things about Bionicle and what the characters are like!",1429315200,,346,4.17910447761194

8437499,5,B004P7CM8W,"This is a doublesided disc that chronicles the story of Turaga Vakama when he was a Toa and why he chose to become a Turaga. Since this is a prequel (told by Vakama after the end of Mask of Light), it helps to know a little. Web of Shadows tells of Vakama's return to Metru Nui to save to Matoran, but find a new evil has taken root and the Toa are turned into Toa Hordika. It's a more darker story, but it is an awesome movie. Since this is a double feature there are no extras. I got it because two great movies at a low price. A must buy!",1388793600,2,541,3.8828828828828827
