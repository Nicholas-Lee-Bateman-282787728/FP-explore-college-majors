7621527,5,B01B2P3ABW,"This is an excellent prison film. There is a good story and plenty of action. This film delivers exactly what action fans want. Plenty of hand to hand combat. Women fighting, men fighting, and a good script. Reese does a good job and Lundgren is excellent as usual. There is a female fighter in the film who also has plenty of well choreographed fights. No sex, no nudity, no profanity, no graphic violence just plenty of action. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. Lundgren has several fights but Reese and the female lead have most of the fights. Reese is the lead and Lundgren backs him up. This has to be the first film that I've seen Lundgren play a character who is dim witted. It was a nice change of pace. Highly recommended. Film makers take heed you do not need profanity, sex, nudity and graphic violence to make an excellent action film. This film proves that point. This film would probably be rated R for violence. Reese is a good fighter but he doesn't have the charisma that Lundgren has. Dolph is just cool like that.",1462233600,2,1042,4.518518518518518
7621528,5,B01B2P3ABW,"What a show!  I had low expectations for this movie, but it delivered on action and story.  Sure some of the actors weren't the strongest, but let's be honest and take it for what it is, a straight to dvd movie (at least in the U.S.) that has Dolph Lundgren.  Not to mention that prison doctor,  damn fine actor indeed!",1459987200,5,319,4.266666666666667
7621529,2,B01B2P3ABW,"Policeman Jack Stone (Matthew Reese) purposely gets himself thrown into prison following a bank robbery and killing a police officer. He doesn't have good odds, but he is Jack Stone, movie cop with choreographed moves. His goal is to take down Russian mafia boss Balam (Chuck Liddell) who deals drugs from his private quarters inside the prison surrounded by crooked guards. He also runs a protection racket.

Jack befriends mop man William (Dolph Lundgren) and there is also an attached woman's prison where Alena (Danielle Chuchran) causes trouble. Not too hard to figure out.

The plot was highly improbable as was the prison. There were no real twists as the writing exhibited little imagination and dialogue. What the movie features is plenty of prison fighting. How many times can Jack get hit with a club and not go down?

Guide: No sex or nudity. No swearing. Serious no swearing in a prison film. Filmed in Utah.

Danielle Chuchran aka ""Thing One"" wanted the role of Katniss. She ended up playing Kate Mitra in ""Survivor"" and assumed the Katniss pose on several occasions. She has become the leading lady in Utah films.",1453939200,3,1128,4.890052356020942
7621530,5,B01B2P3ABW,Really enjoyed this movie. Chuck Liddel played a good bad guy and Dolph played his role very well. Most of the fight scenes seemed very choreographed but that did not deter from the move. a lot of action,1467331200,,203,4.368421052631579

7621536,2,B01B2P3ABW,So very bad....it was a vehicle for the star to show off his abs. Watch me lift my shirt again. The movie does get a star for the fight scenes - decent choreography.,1464566400,,165,4.03030303030303
7621537,1,B01B2P3ABW,"In my opinion, ""too much drama"" and NOT ENOUGH ""action or fight scenes!"" I mean, this IS a ""men-in-prison"" film, RIGHT?! Heck, in my opinion, ""WOMEN-in-prison"" films are SEVERAL TIMES MORE ENTERTAINING than THIS!",1464480000,,212,5.264705882352941

8749136,3,B01B2P3ABW,"As a volunteer chaplain at a maximum security prison in Texas, it took me a few minutes to hit the ""mental pause"" button on reality and accept the fact that this movie was just flat going to be unbelievable on what really goes on in a prison housing these types of inmates. So once I moved past that, I graciously accepted the fact that this movie had very little vulgarity (especially in light of the milieu in which it took place), very little blood or gore and some spectacularly realistic fight scenes. You know it is going to be a B movie when Dolph Lundgren is the ""name draw"" for a movie but he did a good job as the trustee/janitor/undercover G-man. I was quasi-entertained for an hour and half and can certainly attest that I have seen much worse movies. This is a definite Red Box movie - don't buy it.",1468886400,,812,4.348684210526316
