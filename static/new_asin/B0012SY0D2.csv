3098721,5,B0012SY0D2,"Have this on VHS, and I later transferred to DVD, and I have to say--THE WAIT IS OVER!"" This movie is based on a true story, and it tells the tale of a young nun, who's basically surrounded by lecherous priests, and people who just simply ""play"" near the convent. Needless to say, her will gets slowly broken and she gives in to her desires for men, even dragging other nuns down with her in some of the more erotic scenes. Eventually, she gets caught and punished, and gets stronger in faith..:p  . A MUST OWN if there ever was. Hopefully this DVD won't be chopped and edited.",1255910400,16,577,4.342592592592593

But still it's not for kids. I liked the characters in the movie. I had forgotten it was italian made. There's no subtitles. Color not black & white.",1249689600,8,300,4.101694915254237

8247684,3,B0012SY0D2,A so-so movie that is quite depictive of the times when women were forced into becoming nuns by men on one hand and men trying to disgrace them of their faith through seduction for the satisfaction of their self-ego and with the collusion and the greed for money and sex of the priests and their faculty.,1402272000,2,304,4.446428571428571

8247686,5,B0012SY0D2,"The character of Virginia deLeyva is from real life and used by Alessandro Manzoni in his great historical novel, The Betrothed, written in the 19th century about 17th century events. Sacrilege is one of  2 movies I know of on the subject, the other named The nun of Monza which is hysterical, full of M&S goings on and full of nudity in comparison with the one I speak of. Sacrilege is fairly accurate and garners info from Mario Mazzuchelli's The Nun of Monza, which tells the story of the nun and the corrupt convent, with info from the final trial which followed the discovery of what was going on.  Alessandro Gassman is the only name i know in the cast...jbut they're all great.  Osio is a noblelman who spies  Virginia and determines to have her.  With the help of a corrupt priest he gains entrance into the convent and rapes deLeyva in front of 2 nuns, who become complicit in events that follow and even share Osio with the princess...this is all for real, no making up. Deleyva falls in love with Osio and they become inseparable lovers...she bears him a child, after the first one dies in childbirth.  when a new arrival comes and threatens to tell all she sees, Osio murders her and buries the body in presence of deLeyva and the other nuns.  A priest who is rejected by deLeyva reports them all to a bishop and the investigation begins and ends in a trial which metes out justice to all, but not before Osio tries to kill the 2 nuns who witnessed all the crimes...they survive however and are finally witnesses (torture being acceptable at the time). Oio takes flight at the home of a friend, who finding that there is a agreat reward for Osio's capture, kills him.  The princess is imprisoned in a horrible dungeon for 13 years and later lives the life of a penitent, dying at age 73.  Fantastic true story, well told and acted.  Worth a look...even several.  and by all means read the Manzoni.....Michael, culture fanatic",1364860800,2,1937,4.569364161849711
8247687,5,B0012SY0D2,"This is film is one of a kind, based on a true story.  An Italian/Spanish noble woman, who happens to be a nun, enters the dark and sexual walls of a convent. This film can be classified as, cult, erotic, soft porno and based on a true story! The movie deals with raw sexuality and raw human emotions that only very few dare to explore their own dark desires.  Two big thumps way up.  I am gland this movie was not edited when it went on DVD.",1290988800,6,442,4.057471264367816
8247688,1,B0012SY0D2,it could have been a lot of better maybe they should remake it and make it more modern. the sound is terrbile and i don't really understand it....,1268956800,,146,4.25
8247689,1,B0012SY0D2,"The only sacrilege that there is, is the mere fact of seein and getting this film. Based on a lately 19 century storyline, the plot can be saved but there are absolutly no message and spetially not one single fair-enough either hard or soft(altough there is 2 scenes of nun being forced to engage)sex.

If u are into cult, rare, and retro films, this is the one for you. If u are in anyway other expectations, go and try for the next one...",1260835200,2,440,4.301204819277109
