Monty Python once revealed they built skits on the Thesaurus: ""...Deceased, defunct, dead ...Polly.""

A Day to Kill Mall seems to have been cast using ""Lack of Feelings"": ""...Cold, heartless, callous, deadened"" and so on.

No one gets through the movie without inspiring distaste or disgust.

The deck is stacked.

A killer has planned his day of wrath--one that leads to destruction on a sweeping scale.

Mom asks what he wants for breakfast and is shot in the face.

 Dad wears 70's polyester, uses too much Axe, follows bad business practices and is burned alive.

Why goes unanswered.

It is an absence of a norm--anything suggesting even simple normality or any sense of decency that skews this movie.

The title is not a word play on top of seven layer cake of irony ala black comedy.

It is a bitter thin wafer portraying a blighted, frozen acid tinged suburbia and its paralyzed, emotionally stunted, disaffected  teens.

The protagonist is an unfeeling and oracular teen. How he possesses a god's eye view into every character he sees or how he describes them in so polished a manner is never made clear.

The kid comes off as an apathetic and depressed Juno. But where Diablo Cody stuffed Dorothy Parker sharp comments in her teen and created a comedy, this kid just registers being queasy as he mopes and slides along his dulled razor blade of a life.

Part of the kid's misery might be traced to his fascination with Herman Hesse's Steppenwolf, a work that Hesse himself had the sense to offer as written by someone else--a found manuscript.

The novel is just a vehicle for wild flights of opposing emotions--of mania to depression, of crippling self-doubt to unbounded self-aggrandizement, of reveling in nihilism to longing for order.

In other words, it is a book to be outgrown.

Growth comes out of nowhere in the closing scenes of this movie. The kid chances upon a man who has certainly fallen.

From early in the film, a sad sack of a Peeping Tom has suffered.  He is found aroused or a-whacking, arrested, cuffed, nearly killed in an explosion, mocked, taunted, beaten, spat upon, sexually abused and then left exposed and soiled as a final humiliation.

When the kid enters, his friends (remindful of the satanic minions in Dogma) are filling their web pages with cell shots and apparently taking selfies posed opposite the peeper's gonads.

The kid's first show of kindness is unbridled wrath.  He roars inarticulate rage, driving the tormentors away.

This is followed by what appears an act of simple decency in gently caring for another in distress. The kid helps cover the pervert's nakedness and then drives the guy home, to some shelter from pain,

This would seem to offer a sign for relief from spiritual blight.

But back near the beginning, the kid gets pressured into taking a drug--exactly what he swallows is not known.  LSD? ""Wow! I see wolf people.""  Ecstasy? ""Wow! I never felt this before.""

Thus any change suggesting empathy or compassion might be just mellowing after a high.

Doubt is the last hand dealt from the stacked deck of this movie--one which carries all the meaning and insight found in a lava lamp...turned off.",1413849600,,3200,4.81651376146789
