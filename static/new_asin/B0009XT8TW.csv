8069829,1,B0009XT8TW,This could not be a worse film. Plus the print is almost unwatchable. This film is z-grade in every respect.,1509148800,,108,4.45
8069830,1,B0009XT8TW,"First off, this rating is not for the movie, it is for the transfer to dvd, this has to be one of the worst transfers I have ever seen, snap, crackle & pop, lines all through the movie, It is almost unwatchable, I have bought dvd's from Alpha video in the past and they were fine, but this one is a total joke and a total waste of money. Stay away!",1218585600,2,348,3.915492957746479
