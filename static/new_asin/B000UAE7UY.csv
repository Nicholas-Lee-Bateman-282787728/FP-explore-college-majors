Season Three was the very best of ""Melrose"" because all the stories were so interesting and incredibly over-the-top. My favorite good characters were Jo and Jake (he is absolutely the perfect man!) And my favorite bad characters were Sydney and Kimberly (she is absolutely the perfect psychotic!) And, deserving honorable mention as one of the bitchiest ladies on ""Melrose"" is two-faced Brooke.

These are the Season Three usual suspects:

Alison Parker (Courtney Thorne-Smith)
Jo Reynolds (Daphne Zuniga)
Amanda Woodward (Heather Locklear)
Jane Mancini (Josie Bissett)
Jake Hanson (Grant Show)
Dr. Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro)
Billy Campbell (Andrew Shue)
Dr. Peter Burns (Jack Wagner)
Sydney Andrews (Laura Leighton)
Dr. Kimberly Shaw (Marcia Cross)
Henry/Kimberly's Demon (Zitto Kazann)
Brooke Armstrong Campbell (Kristin Davis)
Matt Fielding (Doug Savant)

2919948,4,B000UAE7UY,"MP season 3 got some very outlandish story lines....

I thought it was funny how Chris kidnapped Sydney and she didn't like him because it was almost the same was when she was obsessed with Michael in season 2.
Why does Jane keep falling for the wrong men? Any guy who shows interest in her, she gets romantically involved with him. Kimberly wanting a baby seemed to come out of nowhere. I don't recall her mentioning that in the past episodes. Alison being the president of D&D seems unbelievable (not that most of this stuff is believable), but she's a drunk, a pushover and not very bright. Then she tried to be just like Amanda..wtf?

But yeah, I recommend this season as long as you've seen season 2 first.",1343606400,,711,4.503875968992248

2919950,5,B000UAE7UY,"Arrived fast and in new, excellent condition. Great season. They say the 90's are now considered retro. That 90's nostalgia is growing. This show is about as 90's as it gets - in a great way. Apart from the fun story lines and excellent actors/characters, this show was all about the latest, greatest fashions of the day (mid-90's). Also, if you're a Desperate Housewives fan, a couple actors from that show can be seen here in their 20's-30's as they began their acting careers - or at least got their big break(s). Escapism at it's finest! Great show, get it!",1302912000,2,561,4.62
2919951,1,B000UAE7UY,"I am a huge Melrose Place fan, so I was happy when Season 3 arrived. Half way through the disks two episodes did not play. I sent the set back for an exchange and the new set that Amazon sent also did not play the same two episodes. Amazon then comfirmed that there was a batch defect, but it was a hassle to get my money back. I don't think I will order DVD's from Amazon again......",1262044800,,384,4.0

I would definately order again even if the product is used.  I have just ordered the fourth season because I am confident with Amazon and their quality of product.,1218931200,,303,4.454545454545454
2919954,5,B000UAE7UY,"Melrose Place - The Third Season is just OUTSTANDING. I mean it, everything about this DVD is amazing. Marcia Cross playing the crazy Kimberly Shaw, is just something we can not miss. Laura Leighton playing Sidney Andrews, and her constant fights with her sister Jane, played by the wonderful Josie Bissett.

Courtney Thorn-Smith and Andrew Shue, totally amazing. I mean, seeing Alison drunk and drunk, and how she is into Billy (Andrew Shue) still. The entire season is wonderful. This is a MUST HAVE DVD SET. Season 4 is coming soon, in a couple days, so don't miss this one as well.

The way Season 3 ended, with psycho Kimberly (Cross) trying to blow up the melrose complex is just something I can't even describe here.

AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING!",1208044800,2,751,4.8062015503875966
2919955,5,B000UAE7UY,"This season is the one that really set the standard for the show. It completely raised the bar. In all honesty it's pretty hard to top this season but the show managed to top itself with more crazy antics. But of course all good things come to an end when the show loses all its magic at the start of season 6 as soon as Sidney's character is killed off and of course the show ended at the end of season 7 which is expected because the show lost all its allure in the prior season. Anyways i just purchase this from Amazon even though i wish the prices for these sets were more price friendly, and Amazon usually offers really good sales on DVD box sets from time to time but unfortunately not on this item, at least not yet. After a boring 1st season where the excitement didn't pick up till Amanda joined the show towards the final episodes and season 2 was just 100% better then season 1 but it didn't go completely over the top as the potential was there in season 2 for all the characters to have crazy story lines and outrageous schemes. The finale of season 2 was amazing leaving so much out in the open and setting things up for an amazing season 3. And in the 3rd season it just puts the cherry on top of the cake with the addition of Jack Wagner as Dr. Peter Burns with his odd hair and awkward lips (Lips that remind me of Adam West from Batman & the way he talks). Watching the DVDs the other night made me realize how addictive this show can be even after all these years. I wish there were more special features or episodes that had more commentary from the actors or creators etc. I think all those special features would probably drive up the cost of the set. Of course i was so sad to see Jo get beaten up by Jakes brother especially because Jo's voice brought so much intensity to the scene. And how could i not feel sorry for poor Allison who had so much to deal with this season as she is just one of the kindest characters on the show. Unfortunately she just down spirals non stop from her drinking addiction to having to witness Billy date her best friend and then to eventually see Billy date and marry that awful backstabbing Brooke Armstrong AKA Charlotte from Sex & the City. UGH....her character was so hated they had to get rid of her in season 4. Pick this season up and enjoy. After seeing the finale again last night i just can't wait any longer 4 the release of season 4 in 2 weeks.",1206662400,,2414,4.215982721382289
2919956,5,B000UAE7UY,"When i first saw season one appearing in shops in november 06, i was tempted to buy it to recall one of my fave shows growing up. But i decided not to, remembering that season one was terrible- melrose hadn't found it's feet and was too earnest back in season one. Then, when i saw season two, i picked it up, i loved watching the show all over again and seeing how it transformed itself from serious issue driven storylines to downright outrageous stories. I'm here in ireland and i have been waiting for season three since last november but still no sign, i bit the bullet and imported from US  recently and this has been highly addictive stuff. This is the Melrose i remember- it was so outrageous and enjoyable and watching now -it still is. Season three really is the start of melrose at it's consistent best. season 4 and 5 continue to match the standard set here. I just loved watching this season. sydney joining the cult, kimberly going nuts again!, Amanda's cancer fight, jo's baby drama, jane being fooled by the sleazy Chris, the introduction of the spoilt Brooke, alison falling of the wagon.
Watching this reminds of how good this show was even though it was never cool to admit it. I watched three to four episodes every chance i could, it's so addictive.
watching also made me think how modern US drama's are not a patch on the old ones. I mean Melrose moved at break neck speed, if u  missed an episode , u really had missed out, someone could have married and divorced in two weeks on this show. Look at Lost and desperate Housewives now, not a patch on this, they take themselves way too seriously when in fact they are very tiresome, i mean the amount of actual plot development in these shows per episode is ridiculous. An hour of Housewives for instance is padded with so called comedy routines with just a mere tease of plot development meeant to whet your appetite. The writers should look back to Melrose, it was so engaging, never a dull moment and the stories went enjoyably fast.

Enjoy this pure treat of telly goodness",1205020800,,2048,4.514824797843666

2919958,5,B000UAE7UY,"Melrose Place - The Third Season is my personal favorite. I love everything about this season, all the backstabbing, bed-hopping, and that crazy Kimberly played brilliantly by Marcia Cross. Courtney Thorne-Smith's character Allison really showed her range battling with alcholism and Laura Leighton finally got to shine as the lovable but troublemaker Sydney. If there is one season to get of Melrose Place, definitely get this one, an explosive ending and I mean that litteraly!",1200528000,4,479,5.4
2919959,5,B000UAE7UY,"This is by far the most fun and Aaron Spelling-ish season ""Melrose Place"" had through its run! The show seemed to have peaked by season 4 (though seasons 5 and 6 are worth checking). It features what is perhaps the most sensational and memorable ""Melrose"" storyline with Kimberly slowly losing her sanity and finally blasting the complex (it's a real shame how Marcia Cross was wasted in her last season). ""Melrose"" went over the top by this time but that's what was so good about it. It was shamelessly campy!",1198108800,6,510,4.677777777777778

I forgot they left you hanging at the end with the big bang.  Love it.",1197417600,5,402,4.089743589743589
2919962,3,B000UAE7UY,"The other reviews have given the standard plot summaries, so I really don't need to regurgitate those. Melrose Place continued to gain steam in the 3rd season, as Amanda (Heather Locklear) and the gang continued to get into crazier (but still fun and trashy) plots that kept you hooked each week. The only plot line that is difficult to watch is the one involving Allison. She is so whiny and self-centered that it just gets boring. Next to Amanda, Sydney is probably one of the most fun characters to watch; kudos to Laura Leighton for making it possible to keep her hooker-gone-good character fresh, funny, and sympathetic all at the same time. Now for the technical review: again, the quality of the transfer is poor. Kristin Davis appears this season as Brooke; her acting skills are almost non-existant; it's easy to hate her character. Amazing to see how much she had grown as an actress by the time she made it to ""Sex and the City"" (although in my opinion, she was also the weakest of that quartet). It looks like video tape and is not of the highest quality. The color is good, but the sharpness and detail are marred by the substandard transfer. The ""extras"" are just rehashed clips from the series. However, there is one somewhat funny extra entitled, ""Everything You Need to Know About Season 3."" Michael Coulton & John Aboud give somewhat funny commentary (totally satiric) as clips from the season are shown. It seems really weird that they would go to the trouble of putting this segment together yet not have any real behind-the-scenes-stuff. So...if you are a Melrose fan or just want to know what the buzz was all about 15 years ago, get this set. It's hours of trashy over-the-top fun! 5 for the trashy fun; 1 for the quality of the print and the crappy extras.",1195344000,13,1780,4.653968253968254
