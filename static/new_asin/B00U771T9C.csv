7029348,2,B00U771T9C,"When comparing the successful post-Twilight careers of Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner, one is clearly not pulling their weight. Stewart and Pattinson have made working with some of today's greatest auteurs a regular occurrence, while Lautner has Abduction and Grown Ups 2 as his non-vampire calling cards. Continuing the mediocre trend is Taylor's latest film, Tracers, a forgettable but fast-paced action vehicle centered on the acrobatic fad known a parkour. Wait, is this 2004?

Unfortunately, most people are probably familiar with the wall-jumping athletic style from the unfortunate film, Brick Mansions, which came a decade after parkour was made popular in the awesome French flick, District B13. So there's a musty, played-out feeling that Tracers is never able to shake, and it doesn't help that the plot is basically Premium Rush with a few more backflips. Lautner is an impressive physical specimen, though, and he employs that athletic ability impressively as Cam, a bike messenger racing through New York's busy streets. He's a well-meaning kid but the Chinese gang he owes money to could care less, and if he doesn't pay soon they're going to hurt the people he loves. Fortune literally crashes into him when his bike is destroyed in an accident with Nikki (Marie Avgeropoulos), a parkour enthusiast who was fleeing from the cops at the time.  This should have been a clue to stay away, but Cam quickly falls for the sexy and mysterious girl, especially when she buys him a brand new bike.

Not that he needs it for long because soon he's part of Nikki's clique of parkour aficionados, who spend their days bouncing off graffiti'ed walls, flipping over cars, and leaping between buildings like gravity and concrete aren't a thing. He even gets a lesson in the Yoda-like Zen of parkour. It's all just ""a state of mind""; ""Don't look where the car is, look where the car isn't."" A quick montage and Cam's got it all down pat, impressing the group's leader, Miller (Adam Rayner), who doesn't actually seem to do much parkour at all. That's because he's busy plotting robberies that put their special acrobatic skills to the test. Hey, you got your Point Break in my Tracers!!

Let's just say there's barely a trace of an interesting plot to be found. You can probably figure where things go from there as Cam must decide whether his need for cash is worth becoming a criminal. The predictable love triangle that emerges between Cam, Nikki, and Miller is dulled by lackluster performances, especially by the bland Avgeropoulos. On the other hand, Lautner's physicality and willingness to do his own stunts is extremely impressive, although he remains a stiff romantic lead. Cleanly directed by Daniel Benmayor and shot by DP Nelson Cragg, the free-running scenes are well-photographed and slickly edited. From the rooftops to the back alleys NYC looks great, and due to the very nature of parkour it makes an important backdrop to the action.

Tracers might have been better as a supercut of parkour athleticism than a feature film. Certainly it's not going to send Lautner leaping up to the level of his Twilight cast mates anytime soon.",1426809600,3,3171,4.9981060606060606

7029366,3,B00U771T9C,"I didn't expect much when I watched this movie and I wasn't disappointed.

Tracers isn't going to win any Academy Awards, on the surface it's your typical hot boy meets sexy girl movie disguised as an action flick surrounded by some well done Parkour scenes.

The plot is loosely held together and it gets convoluted at times, the characters are pretty to look at (Taylor Lauthner/Marie Avgeropoulos) but don't have any chemistry between them and worse don't develop any depth to their characters.

There is a plot twist near the end that surprises you but overall the movie is mostly about Parkour and nothing more.

There's no nudity or profanity in Tracers so kids and teens will enjoy the Parkour scenes and watching Lauthner and Avgeropoulos on screen.
Tracers is not a deep movie but if you don't take it to seriously, you may just may be entertained like I was",1445731200,4,867,4.7218543046357615
7029367,4,B00U771T9C,ok,1445644800,,2,2.0
7029368,3,B00U771T9C,"When you pop Tracers into your DVD player and hit play, the first you immediately notice is how low budget the film is and how bad some of the camera work is. Obviously they couldn't afford to do some of these scenes (especially the ones swerving a bike through traffic or the parkour action), twice, so if they didn't get all of the stuntman in a shot, they couldn't redo it. The lighting is more like a home movie quality and the cameras, well you notice them moving as your view moves with the lens and it pans or changes angles.

You could live with that if it was a great story, but it's not. It's your standard nice guy owes a lot of money to loan sharks who even though it should be pretty obvious he's not going to be able to come up with the cash, decide beating him up will somehow get them the money. Why not force him to deliver drugs or something, since he's already a courier? Anyway our nice guy had his front wheel wrecked by a Parkour girl, and for some reason can't just buy a new wheel like everyone else would, but has to throw away the bike. This makes earning income pretty difficult when you're a b.y.o bike courier. But anyway Parkour girl anonymously buys him a new one, so when he spots her he's got to chase her. You can work out how the rest of it goes. Of course Parkour girl and her parkour mates aren't just doing that activity for fun, and what they do may be a way for nice guy to get some cash.

For me there are better parkour movies out there than this one, and since parkour is the only real reason to get this, I'd buy one of them instead.",1444003200,,1577,4.133550488599348

7029388,4,B00U771T9C,"Taylor Lautner may always be remembered as Jacob, the annoying werewolf boy from the Twilight Series. People have a hard time seeing him as anything else, but Tracers is the second action film I've seen him star in, and this kid has the perfect make up to be a huge action star. Lautner is more than just another good looking actor, as he can speak several languages, is a martial arts expert, and an avid parkourer, all skills he uses in his latest film, Tracers. Lautner plays Cam, a down on his luck bike messenger, who comes to befriend a group of parkour enthusiasts. What they do fascinates Cam and he wants to join them, but when he does, he realizes that they aren't just clowning around, they use their skills to commit crime, and once he's in, Cam has no way out. Original action films are hard to come by, as most people are satisfied with all the special effects and dead bodies. It's a genre that really doesn't call for originality, that's why when you come across a film like this, it's a breath of fresh air. The stunts and moves you see in this film are nothing short of magic, and it's star Taylor Lautner did them all himself. We are so used to seeing Lautner as the sensitive love interest in some romanticized film, that it's hard to even imagine him as an action star, but that changes 10 minutes into this film. It's the stunts, the attitude, his characters whole personality, that makes his a unique a-typical action star, and it is really something to see. On the surface, Tracers may be nothing more than another story about a group of burglars, but what they can do is extraordinary, and was really fun to watch. This film is original, fast paced, and brings to light a new action star, who isn't in his sixties or the WWE. It may not have all the bodies and explosions normally associated with this type of film, but as I said, It was a lot of fun to watch.",1437264000,8,1885,4.388571428571429

7029406,5,B00U771T9C,"Didn't really have high expectations for this movie so surprisingly I was shocked when I ended up loving it. Lautner actually has insane skills and proves himself as an action star. I think the only reason people dismiss him as an actor is because he was in the Twilight movies but he has so much more talent than that. Same thing happened to Leo when he wa sin Titanic guys didn't like him because he wa sin a chick flick and now thanks to movies like Wolf of wall street, Inception, and Django Unchained guys tend to think he is a awesome actor. I see the same or Taylor he has talent and skill and its only a matte rof time before people are forced to notice. Also the story line in this movie was quite good you feel for Cam as he has had a tough life and kinda is forced to take the wrong path to make things right and protect the ones he loves!

7029412,2,B00U771T9C,"I just saw this movie and I felt the movie was just below average. The movie seemed okay with the story, but needed more explaining for some parts. The main male and female leads are okay to look at, but once you pass that point, what do we have? A pretty much below standard movie about a guy trying to pay back the Chinese Mafia. He needs to do odd jobs to pay them back, but tons of things keep on happening to him, where he just can't seem to get a break. Now that break comes in form of him wanting to get to know the female lead and she gets him into a whole new world of tracing or parkour.

Now the movie had an interesting idea, get a team of parkour people and do burglary jobs around the city. There was a 3 way love triangle going on with the boss man and the two leads and that seemed to be the main problem that they had to figured out, which ended up fixing everything at the end of the movie too. What luck? I guess.

Finally, I like to say the movie had a very happy ending. What I didn't like was it was pretty much forced to be a happy ending. Like I mentioned before  everything seemed to easily fall into place and I hate that kind of movie. The two leads basically get everything they wanted at the end and they literally drive off into the sunset!?!?

The girl in this Marie Avgeropoulos is just another in a long line of talentless actresses who have no real talent and pretty much pout and be angry as their way of acting. Please let her never get another part. The support parkour guys are, at best okay, no Golden Globe nominees here. And now for the prime offender, Taylor Lautner, Can someone please tell me why anyone thinks that he can carry a movie? He was okay in Twilight, okay in Grown ups and that is because he (so far) has not shown any real acting chops!

Lautner who was my guilty jailbait crush even before the Twilight movies existed... and definitely after.

7029438,2,B00U771T9C,"Tracers stars Taylor Lautner (Twilight series) in a crime drama featuring lots of stunt work, running, jumping, sprinting, and acrobatics by its star. Cam (Lautner) is a bike messenger who cant make ends meet, financially. Hes in heavy debt to loan sharks who have threatened physical harm if Cam doesnt fork over what he owes. Eventually, he falls for a young woman, Nikki (Marie Avgeropoulos), whos a member of a parkour crime ring. She enlists him into her gang and hes receptive, seeing a way to get enough cash to pay off the sharks.

The plot is familiar, but its the action that constitutes the movies primary attraction. Lautner doesnt really have what it takes to be an action hero. His tough guy demeanor never convinces. His last film, Addiction. faired poorly at the box office, and Tracers suffers from an overabundance of action flick cliches. The romantic interludes featuring Cam and Nikki deaden the pace rather than enhance characterization.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette and the directors pitch reel.",1431302400,20,1059,5.045714285714285

After meeting Nikki (Avgeropoulos) he becomes involved in the world of parkour, and meets some new friends. When his past catches up with him he is thankful for his new life. This is a hard movie to talk about, mainly because I didn't think it was necessary. It seemed like they wanted to capitalize on the parkour craze that is going around so they built a movie around that. Brick Mansions did the same thing but they had a actual movie built around it (even though it was a Fast and Furious remake). The makers of this one hope that the draw of parkour and Taylor Lautner is enough. If I was younger that may have helped, being 36 it did nothing for me but bore me for an hour and a half. The movie is predictable and not that exciting, but a younger crowd may love it. Overall, a movie I could not get into and when it was over I wondered what the point of it was.

Don't watch it for the plot and great screenplay. You'll find it wanting.
But, Lautner and crew to deliver some quality performances with the lines they were given and their cool stunts...that's what you're watching it for. It delivers. The downfall of this movie is the editing. It skips the character development which is why the movie seems flat and 2-dimensional.  The actual performances are pretty good.

7029456,3,B00U771T9C," a spoiler-free review 
What sets Tracers apart from other films to date is, of course, traceurs being central to the plot. More than being central, the traceurs ARE the plot, which is as thin as a Vogue model. If parkour doesn't interest you, then all you have left is Taylor Lautner, Marie Avgeropoulos, and some shady dudes. It's typical boy meets girl but there's an obstacle, boy is in some kind of trouble and/or boy gets mixed up with the wrong crowd, etc., but with the cast jumping around like maniacs, and guns entering the equation at some point.

This is perhaps a breakout role for Marie Avgeropoulos in film (TV/sci-fi junkies already know her from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-100/dp/B00ONEM9MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 100</a>), although she isn't going to win any awards here. She's the athletic type, and Tracers gives her the opportunity to make this apparent. If she's not your cup of tea, then Tracers provides Taylor Lautner, who will make Twilight girls swoon every bit as much as he did when they were younger. I'm still not convinced that the acting chops are there, but at least Taylor became proficient enough at parkour to be mistaken for a traceur in a movie; he is nothing if not physically fit.

There are a few reasons why I may be giving Tracers more credit than it's due:
 As a former NYC bike messenger, I'm a sucker for mediocre movies like this and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicksilver/dp/B001EJDBOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicksilver</a>&nbsp;that remind me of life in the fast lane.
 Marie Avgeropoulos. Is she talented? Who cares! That's not why I like her. ( )
 Tracers is reminiscent of the immersive parkour video game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mirror-s-Edge/dp/B0047O2Q02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mirror's Edge</a>, which was incredibly fun (and incidentally is getting a prequel in 2016 that ""will revolve around Faith's past""); speaking of video games, can you help but notice the similarity between the movie poster for Tracers and the cover art for the game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Splinter-Cell-Blacklist/dp/B00CAY50CW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Splinter Cell Blacklist</a>? Not surprising, as the target demographic for Tracers is probably gamers.

If you start to feel like there will be no twists at all in the plot: a tiny one is added about 3/4 of the way in. The ending is way too tidy (and predictable), but it's often a wild ride getting there.",1427068800,4,2613,5.894179894179894
7029457,2,B00U771T9C,"Cam (Taylor Lautner) is a NYC bike messenger. He owes the Chinese mafia money and his bicycle just got wreaked by Nikki (Marie Avgeropoulos) an aloof parkopur (free running urban acrobats) beauty. Cam, who is athletic, trains himself and joins the group lead by Miller (Adam Rayner). The group does more than run as they rob bad guys which creates issues.

Everyone in the group seems to have a lame secret they hide. The plot is thin as the film is consumed with kids running and jumping. If you are into parkour, this film should have appeal to you, but for an old couch potato, there really isn't much to see.
