8706165,3,B00UGPQE6S,"Janet Gaynor plays a goofy rube following author/playboy Robert Montgomery to New York by coincidence. Its actually painful to watch such accomplished actors (Gaynor, Montgomery, Tone) performing in this silly comedy. Gaynor won the academy award for her portrayals in 7th Heaven, Street Angel, and Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans and was nominated for A Star is Born. Her performance in this comedy is exceptional, but the role is below her level of talent. This movie may provide a few laughs, but theres better content elsewhere. Too silly for celluloid.",1467331200,,555,5.1098901098901095
