8721842,4,B010CG2EE6,"Not nearly as bad as made out by other reviewers. The sets and production is actually very good, and the story is far better than most formulaic mainstream movies.  There is a lot to love about this movie, if taken on it's own merits.  While the acting was a bit stilted in the beginning, the actors came into their own about a quarter of the way through, and the ending, which eludes most productions, was satisfying.  The ""sugar skulls"" were the lowest part of the production, they looked like puppets and acted like puppets.  Other than that, it's worth watching.",1509062400,,566,4.63

8721844,3,B010CG2EE6,"The most devious aspect of this 2015 film is that it is a re-release of a 2009 film ""Skull Heads.""

This is a Charles Band film. He has made over 300 horror films (Puppet Master, Killjoy etc.) and has a cult following. There are three characteristics of his films:

1) comedy
2) Bad props
3) pretty topless women (Robin Sydney in this case)

An odd-ball American family lives in a castle in Italy. The brother Peter (Giacomo Gonnella) is a bit of a half-wit. The parents are strict on Naomi (Robin Sydney) who we first see on a torture rake for having a cell phone...something she considers normal. Three outsiders show up claiming they want to shoot a film. They are told of the ""Protectors"" or skull heads who watch over them.

This film has been around under different titles and is on at least two multi-packs that I know about. The acting is typical for this type of production. The props were indeed cheesy. The dialogue, I liked at times as mom read Poe as if she had it memorized ""And all I loved, I loved alone...""
