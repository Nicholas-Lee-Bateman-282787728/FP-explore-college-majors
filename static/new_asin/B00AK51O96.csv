5445029,5,B00AK51O96,"This has not disappointed me as it maintains the standards of the earlier seasons of TV's Pioneers.  Besides being entertaining, it brings out the challenges encountered during the making of the shows we loved to watch. This is a great item documenting history of the early television shows many grew up watching.",1366761600,,313,5.019230769230769
5445030,5,B00AK51O96,"Season 3 follows other great episodes of season 1 and 2 of the television history of certain genres. Covered in this set are Funny Ladies"", ""Prime Time Soaps"", ""Superheroes"" and ""Miniseries"". All great in their own right. i wish they were longer as they could have added some additional programs or people. must have for those interested in the history of television programs",1366070400,,375,4.968253968253968
5445031,5,B00AK51O96,"In this, the third 4-episode season of the PBS series - the ""genres"" covered are ""Funny Ladies"", ""Prime Time Soaps"", ""Superheroes"" and ""Miniseries"" Of course, as the seasons continue they need to find new ""genres"" to cover. It's been a while since I watched the first two seasons but it seemed to me that, this time they concentrated each episode on less shows - most often, only two or three. They did get a lot of celebrities to be interviewed (and some crossed genres, like Joan Collins in both ""Primetime Soaps"" (""Dynasty"") and ""Superheroes"" (Batman).

Each episode runs 55 minutes.
Funny Ladies concentrated on Mary Tyler Moore and her appearances on The Dick Van Dyke Show as well as her own series. Carol Burnett is shown on the Gary More Show and then her own Variety Show. Betty White - the one with the longest career is shown on her MANY shows. And then there are the standup comediennes Joan Rivers and Phyllis Diller (in her last recorded interview).
Prime Time Soaps spends all it's time on the big three from the late 70s - Dallas, Knots Landing and Dynasty.

Superheros spend MOST of the time on Batman while also covering 4 more: Superman from the 1950s (but in COLOR!), The Incredible Hulk, Wonder Woman and The Greatest American Hero.
The Miniseries episode spends the first 27 minutes on Roots - the most watched TV series at that time. They seem to have interviewed nearly all the major cast members and there are lots of clips. The remain time is spent on just two other series: Rich Man, Poor Man and The Thorne Birds. (the latter has actress Rachel Ward describing how here role was so badly cast, that it ended her acting career.)

Ryan Seachrist is the narrator for all the episodes in Season 3. Each Episode ends with a few minutes of ""Trivia Quiz"" about the shows covered and each of the two DVDs has 4 short interview outtakes (two from each of the episodes on the disc.)

While I didn't feel they covered enough of 1950 and 1960 TV as they have in the past, the series does capture and preserve the cast members memories and - especially if you were a fan of these genres - you'll enjoy it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5445032,5,B00AK51O96,"I love this series. A look back at all of our favorite shows and actors of the different genres. Very well done salute to a time we will never see again. A time when there were only three networks, and when your favorite shows came on the world stopped for that 30 minutes or maybe a few hours. This season includes the superheroes, so to Linda Carter I say that you are still a ""wonder"". And to the rest of my heroes, thanks for the great TV!!!!!!",1363305600,2,448,4.160919540229885

5445044,5,B00AK51O96,This is really good. There are 4 different episodes in different categories. It really makes me watch things that I was too young to watch at the time they came out or had no interest then. Wish there were more of them. This is the only one I could find.,1408665600,,254,4.1

5445051,5,B00AK51O96,We loved it. There are a lot of classic moments you can re-live while watching this.,1406332800,,84,4.3125
5445052,5,B00AK51O96,"I'm of the Boom age that appreciates documentaries like this that stirs the memories.  The whole Pioneers of Television series has been a treat!  Of course, there are always some things (I would've liked to see in them) that must be omitted for time sake.",1405900800,,255,4.644444444444445
5445053,2,B00AK51O96,"Not very well done.  Lots of old clips I'd already seen a hundred times, and some less-than-incisive social commentary.  I watched the segment on funny women, and I won't be watching another.",1405555200,,191,4.9375
5445054,5,B00AK51O96,This has always been my absolute favorite of Danny Kaye's works. A man of so many talents in this movie he gives a full measure of how great he really was. The Court Jester is a classic movie that shows precision correagraphy and entertainment in all purity. It is a movie for every member of the family. Especially for those who are rightly concerned with what their children are watching on television. This is true movie making and pure entertainment.,1404172800,,454,4.6875
5445055,5,B00AK51O96,"Some were settlers on what might have been discovered by the pioneers though,  I do recommend these highly, but then, some weren't really ""pioneers""!",1404000000,,149,5.208333333333333
5445056,3,B00AK51O96,"I really enjoy this PBS series; however, this installment on prime time soap operas focused primarily on three series: ""Dallas,"" ""Dynasty,"" and ""Knot's Landing."" There are so many others worth noting that are notable in pop culture. No mention of ""Soap,"" ""Melrose Place,"" ""Ally McBeal,"" etc. Not my favorite in the series. On a side note, it was somewhat disconcerting to watch these once-glamorous women who have now gone overboard with plastic surgery. So sad that they don't feel comfortable to age gracefully.",1403308800,,513,5.192771084337349
5445057,4,B00AK51O96,"Although there were many shows that I did not see or care to see, most were represented on this program.
Nostalgic for sure!",1402099200,,124,4.434782608695652
5445058,4,B00AK51O96,I found Pioneers of Television to be very interesting.  Some things that I had forgot about the shows came back to me and it was nice to see them again.  If you watched these shows in the past you will enjoy seeing the Pioneers of Television.,1401321600,,242,4.239130434782608

do not buy this DVD
unless you wish to torture yourself",1399420800,,129,4.2
5445062,4,B00AK51O96,"Some of these shows I remember, some were farther back than me.  It's interesting to think of T.V. as ""new"" technology, and that there were pioneers in the fields.  Also, that T.V. could have had opportunities for women that made it a more level playing field than other areas of the entertainment industry.  Funny, entertaining, illuminating.",1399248000,,343,5.089285714285714
5445063,5,B00AK51O96,"I watched the episode on women comics and, while it appeared to be limited only to the comics for which there was a lot of TV footage, it was enjoyable, interesting and fun. I'll check out more episodes.",1397520000,,203,4.368421052631579

5445066,3,B00AK51O96,"This show was interesting, but to scattered to provide much new information about these women. I think it would have been better as a series showing how each of these women impacted television.",1396569600,,193,4.878787878787879
5445067,4,B00AK51O96,Good not great.  I am sorry they mainly work on newer stars.  But I understand many of the classics people don't know any longer.  Earlier seasons did cover some of the classics better.  Give it a try there is still a lot to learn and enjoy.,1396396800,,241,4.173913043478261
5445068,5,B00AK51O96,A great look at early tv stars and clips of their shows. Some I remember from my childhood and some from earlier years.,1395705600,,119,4.217391304347826

5445071,5,B00AK51O96,"I'm a television addict so Pioneers of Television was a nice thing to watch, especially since I was a child when many of the profiled shows were on television the first time.  it was nice to hear about the stories again, from the other side, from the people who made them.  It even hit on socio-political issues like the issue of race in nighttime soaps.  Recommended to any other tv junkies.",1393718400,,392,4.492957746478873

5445074,3,B00AK51O96,It is worth a watch just to remember if you are old enough.  Except for part 2 anyone under 40 would find this boring.,1391126400,,118,3.9166666666666665

5445077,5,B00AK51O96,"Not the most compelling doc series you'll ever see, but very competently produced. It's well researched and entertaining to watch as you actually learn a few things along the way. I've taught some of this content to underclassmen and having these videos as visual aides perhaps proves their value over and over.",1388188800,,311,5.0
5445078,5,B00AK51O96,"It's WONDERFUL.  This entire series is ""all that"".  If you've been around since the small-tube sets, you'll wax nostalgic.
