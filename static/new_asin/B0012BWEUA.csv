Where is character, truth and honor in many of our candidates? Opinions aside, the actual clips of Hillary speaking on so many issues speaks volumes of her inability to lead with character. Come on women, don't you think we can do better????????

I had heard rumors of Hillary's behavior around secret service, but didn't really pursue. I always thought it strange that she didn't as a wife handle Bill's philandering better. After all if she's so for women's rights I would have thought she would have handled things differently esp when it happened multiple times.

It was a well crafted, carefully constructed documentary about Hilary Clinton presented through her own words and the words of those that have worked with her and dealt with her through her career. It shows her insatiable ambition for power that can easily be paralleled with many politicians today and other brokers of power. I found this video to be an oportunity for Americans to glimps the reality of politics behind the curtain of media glitz and smoke and mirrors to see the true face of those we blindly place in power. Despite your opinions of Hilary Clinton, this video offers an alternate view of the inner workings of our most precious positions and the real faces of those behind them!",1280880000,11,738,4.728682170542636

There is no real analysis, only character assasination from people who are one-sided ennemies of Hillary.

These attacks are repeated oveone after the other by dozens of people during the whole movie, nothing else is offered.

3086257,1,B0012BWEUA,"For long periods between 1980 and 2008, the far right had control of all branches of government.  Only the rise of Bill Clinton broke the total Republican control of the government. The savage attacks on the Clintons were, in general, lies, bigger lies and insane charges. The right never fights fair.  They have bought much of the media and silenced what they could not buy.

This is another in a series of nasty, badly researched, dishonest films which essentially throws everything but the kitchen sink at a target, which the the filmmakers believe should be universally hated.  This is a movie that would appeal to men who like to beat their wives.  Or men who would enjoy beating their wives but are too afraid of getting their asses kicked by their wives.  The constant attacks on Hilary Clinton, in addition to being tedious, are cowardly attacks by bullies, who really don't care about facts or fairness or good government.

The right wing noise machine has trained an undereducated angry white male population to turn off the brain and respond with hatred to certain icons and catch words.  It is as if a large segment of the population has been hypnotised and they respond by rote.  This is a bad movie, a trashy pile of charges assembled by Hillary-haters.  It is well that the Hillary-haters have busied themselves with making a lousy movie; it gives them less time to bring guns to the fascist anti-Obama rallies being staged by Fox News.",1252108800,7,1451,4.768
3086258,4,B0012BWEUA,"A movie that Hilary and her associates, would not allow the prime time media to air to the American people.... Why, I think you can understand why?

3086259,5,B0012BWEUA,"This movie was an excellent review of how untrustworthy Hillary Clinton was and is. Like most progressive pragmatists (AKA liberal fascists), she is arrogant, condescending, self-righteous and quick to ad hominem attacks when in discussion of competing ideas. This movie does justice to Barbara Olson's memory. The thought of Hillary reminds one of Saul Alinsky and William Ayers.",1241395200,7,380,5.568965517241379
3086260,2,B0012BWEUA,"I like to rail on liberals more than anyone, but this movie just doesn't do it for me.  After watching it, I thought Hillary was more typical than unusually evil.  Maybe my hopes were set to high to walk away loathing the woman, when instead I just said, ""That's Washington.""

But then again, these propaganda movies tend to have an opposite effect on me.",1229385600,4,355,4.515625
3086261,4,B0012BWEUA,"What I found the most interesting in this film was the careful documentation of the varied positions Hillary Clinton has taken on so many issues. These are not just quotations, mind you; they're news clips of Hillary at public appearances, where she contradicts herself over and over again, on any number of questions and issues.

Many concern Hillary's involvement in the Whitewater real estate scandal, illicit commodities trading, cover-ups of Bill's infidelities, and the like.

Then there's the matter of why, exactly, in February 1999 Bill Clinton did not order U.S. forces to bomb bombing a falcon training camp in the Afghan desert where Osama bin Laden was hunting with Dubai sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. And why ABC television, a Disney company subsidiary, suddenly killed its docudrama mini series, ""The Path to 9/11,"" virtually on the eve of its airing.

And portions of the film concern unresolved questions about TWA flight 800, which according to witnesses, was shot down in the Atlantic Ocean on July 17, 1996 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy airport en route to Italy.

I don't give much credence to theories proposed as to who might have perpetrated such an act.

Nevertheless, the eyewitness testimonies, together with those from employees of TWA and former national security officials, do raise serious questions on why the the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not fully investigate this matter, but rather effectively silenced witnesses. Consequently. the National Transportation Safety Board announced on November 17 1997 that there had been no evidence of criminality.

In fact, there appears to have been a great deal of evidence, certainly of foul play. And dozens of these credible scraps of data are included in the film, along with film and testimony concerning the corroborating evidence. At the very least, many plausible questions remain.

What interested me the most, however, was Bill Clinton's pardon of 16 convicted FALN terrorists, whose organization claimed responsibility for bombing the Fraunces Tavern in New York on January 24, 1975. The incident killed four innocent civilians and seriously wounded 60 others. Some of the FALN members were serving 50 year sentences that were commuted---evidently because Hillary Clinton heavily lobbied Bill to do so, at the request of Hispanic leaders in New York.

In 1999, when those pardons were granted, Hillary Clinton was merely ""exploring"" the possibility of moving to New York State and running for Senator.

My biggest problem with this film is the opening, which goes on for a good 10 to 12 minutes, during which many pundits and former political advisers make pithy comments on Hillary's inappropriateness for office. But during that span, none of the speakers are identified, and no facts are given, only opinion.

After that, the film is composed entirely of interviews, identified film clips----and tons of facts.

Contrary to the opinion of some reviewers, the issues and questions in raised in this film are by and large substantiated with facts, dates, newspaper clips and news reels. It would be a mistake to dismiss it simply because of the film's etiology.",1218758400,40,3182,5.2074363992172215

3086267,4,B0012BWEUA,John Edwards has it right!  The problem with nostalgia is you only remember the good things.  This movie reminds us of all those things we have forgotten over the years. It's nice to have a movie that doesn't beat drums and slant history and shows those events that the media has conveniently swept under the rug. Not only does it show the events it has many of the real players in these events telling their side of the story in their own words. Don't worry this is not a film about Whitewater or Monica even though it did leave out many other events that should have been covered. If everything were covered you would have to buy an album of DVD's. After seeing this movie I sure wouldn't even let Hillary baby-sit my children or grandchildren.,1202169600,12,746,4.477941176470588
3086268,5,B0012BWEUA,I saw the movie last night in Los Angeles.  It refreshed my memory of all the things the Clintons have been involved in.  It is hard to believe that someone like Hillary could get as far as she has in America without being stopped.  I pray she will never be president of our great country. She can best be described as a power hungry female pitbull.  I am going to buy a bunch of these DVDs and send them to people that don't know the rest of the story.,1201824000,71,453,4.056179775280899
3086269,5,B0012BWEUA,"I just saw a screening of this movie tonight. They did an excellent job of sticking to facts which were all well-documented and in most cases presented by the actual people who had first hand knowledge of the incriminating situations in which the Clintons participated. There were newspaper headlines and visuals of the actual stories to add to the veracity of the information. Also interviews and reports by actual journalists who were present at the time and big name journalists and pundits from both sides of the aisle. All of these participants see the importance of getting the word out to the American public in a clear, concise way so that there can be no question as to what went on (the Clintons' participation in some very illegal events.)

I won't list them. We all know what they are or at least some of them. But seeing the inside scheming that was going on and seeing Hilary in her own words pulling this stuff off, was really enlightening, scary, no make that terrifying. And the thought that she and Bill could get the power back to once again perpetrate this stuff on the American people is really alarming.

You'll also see the three minutes that the Clintons intimidated Disney into cutting from the TV DocuDrama, ""The Path to 9-11"".  Can you say ""censorship""? Just imagine if Bush had intimidated a moviemaker and kept them from putting out some information about his administration. You'll see why the Clintons wanted to keep the lid on these facts and what really went on.

Where is character, truth and honor in many of our candidates? Opinions aside, the actual clips of Hillary speaking on so many issues speaks volumes of her inability to lead with character. Come on women, don't you think we can do better????????

I had heard rumors of Hillary's behavior around secret service, but didn't really pursue. I always thought it strange that she didn't as a wife handle Bill's philandering better. After all if she's so for women's rights I would have thought she would have handled things differently esp when it happened multiple times.

I found this video to be an oportunity for Americans to glimps the reality of politics behind the curtain of media glitz and smoke and mirrors to see the true face of those we blindly place in power.

3320754,1,B0012BWEUA,"For long periods between 1980 and 2008, the far right had control of all branches of government.  Only the rise of Bill Clinton broke the total Republican control of the government. The savage attacks on the Clintons were, in general, lies, bigger lies and insane charges. The right never fights fair.  They have bought much of the media and silenced what they could not buy.

This is another in a series of nasty, badly researched, dishonest films which essentially throws everything but the kitchen sink at a target, which the the filmmakers believe should be universally hated.  This is a movie that would appeal to men who like to beat their wives.  Or men who would enjoy beating their wives but are too afraid of getting their asses kicked by their wives.  The constant attacks on Hilary Clinton, in addition to being tedious, are cowardly attacks by bullies, who really don't care about facts or fairness or good government.

The right wing noise machine has trained an undereducated angry white male population to turn off the brain and respond with hatred to certain icons and catch words.  It is as if a large segment of the population has been hypnotised and they respond by rote.  This is a bad movie, a trashy pile of charges assembled by Hillary-haters.  It is well that the Hillary-haters have busied themselves with making a lousy movie; it gives them less time to bring guns to the fascist anti-Obama rallies being staged by Fox News.",1252108800,7,1451,4.768

Maybe my hopes were set to high to walk away loathing the woman, when instead I just said, ""That's Washington.""

But then again, these propaganda movies tend to have an opposite effect on me.",1229385600,4,355,4.515625
3320758,4,B0012BWEUA,"What I found the most interesting in this film was the careful documentation of the varied positions Hillary Clinton has taken on so many issues. These are not just quotations, mind you; they're news clips of Hillary at public appearances, where she contradicts herself over and over again, on any number of questions and issues.

Many concern Hillary's involvement in the Whitewater real estate scandal, illicit commodities trading, cover-ups of Bill's infidelities, and the like.

Then there's the matter of why, exactly, in February 1999 Bill Clinton did not order U.S. forces to bomb bombing a falcon training camp in the Afghan desert where Osama bin Laden was hunting with Dubai sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. And why ABC television, a Disney company subsidiary, suddenly killed its docudrama mini series, ""The Path to 9/11,"" virtually on the eve of its airing.

And portions of the film concern unresolved questions about TWA flight 800, which according to witnesses, was shot down in the Atlantic Ocean on July 17, 1996 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy airport en route to Italy.

I don't give much credence to theories proposed as to who might have perpetrated such an act.

Nevertheless, the eyewitness testimonies, together with those from employees of TWA and former national security officials, do raise serious questions on why the the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not fully investigate this matter, but rather effectively silenced witnesses. Consequently. the National Transportation Safety Board announced on November 17 1997 that there had been no evidence of criminality.

In fact, there appears to have been a great deal of evidence, certainly of foul play. And dozens of these credible scraps of data are included in the film, along with film and testimony concerning the corroborating evidence. At the very least, many plausible questions remain.

What interested me the most, however, was Bill Clinton's pardon of 16 convicted FALN terrorists, whose organization claimed responsibility for bombing the Fraunces Tavern in New York on January 24, 1975. The incident killed four innocent civilians and seriously wounded 60 others. Some of the FALN members were serving 50 year sentences that were commuted---evidently because Hillary Clinton heavily lobbied Bill to do so, at the request of Hispanic leaders in New York.

In 1999, when those pardons were granted, Hillary Clinton was merely ""exploring"" the possibility of moving to New York State and running for Senator.

My biggest problem with this film is the opening, which goes on for a good 10 to 12 minutes, during which many pundits and former political advisers make pithy comments on Hillary's inappropriateness for office. But during that span, none of the speakers are identified, and no facts are given, only opinion.

After that, the film is composed entirely of interviews, identified film clips----and tons of facts.

Contrary to the opinion of some reviewers, the issues and questions in raised in this film are by and large substantiated with facts, dates, newspaper clips and news reels. It would be a mistake to dismiss it simply because of the film's etiology.",1218758400,40,3182,5.2074363992172215

3320764,4,B0012BWEUA,John Edwards has it right!  The problem with nostalgia is you only remember the good things.  This movie reminds us of all those things we have forgotten over the years. It's nice to have a movie that doesn't beat drums and slant history and shows those events that the media has conveniently swept under the rug. Not only does it show the events it has many of the real players in these events telling their side of the story in their own words. Don't worry this is not a film about Whitewater or Monica even though it did leave out many other events that should have been covered. If everything were covered you would have to buy an album of DVD's. After seeing this movie I sure wouldn't even let Hillary baby-sit my children or grandchildren.,1202169600,12,746,4.477941176470588

3320766,5,B0012BWEUA,"I just saw a screening of this movie tonight. They did an excellent job of sticking to facts which were all well-documented and in most cases presented by the actual people who had first hand knowledge of the incriminating situations in which the Clintons participated. There were newspaper headlines and visuals of the actual stories to add to the veracity of the information. Also interviews and reports by actual journalists who were present at the time and big name journalists and pundits from both sides of the aisle. All of these participants see the importance of getting the word out to the American public in a clear, concise way so that there can be no question as to what went on (the Clintons' participation in some very illegal events.)

I won't list them. We all know what they are or at least some of them. But seeing the inside scheming that was going on and seeing Hilary in her own words pulling this stuff off, was really enlightening, scary, no make that terrifying. And the thought that she and Bill could get the power back to once again perpetrate this stuff on the American people is really alarming.

You'll also see the three minutes that the Clintons intimidated Disney into cutting from the TV DocuDrama, ""The Path to 9-11"".  Can you say ""censorship""? Just imagine if Bush had intimidated a moviemaker and kept them from putting out some information about his administration. You'll see why the Clintons wanted to keep the lid on these facts and what really went on.
