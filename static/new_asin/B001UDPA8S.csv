8343321,3,B001UDPA8S,"Danny Trejo has a big following locally so I always order his films for the store. Unfortunately, he only gets two minutes of screen time.

Spoilers: We have a story about a man getting out of prison after serving 17 years for killing the man who assaulted his teen girlfriend. Tries to hold a job, wants to make more money, gets into dealing drugs, finds love, loses love, doles out a bunch of retribution, then partakes in one of the corniest endings I have seen in a B film like this.

The acting with the lead was so overblown that it was distracting, but some of the supporting cast gives an adequate performance or two. Other reviews claim the magnificence of the score, but it repeats the same chords throughout the film. While played in the 5.1 mode, it drowns out whole segments of dialogue and is poorly timed. All of the horrible Scarface wannabe action does not happen until 92 minutes into the film, which ends a few minutes later. Hated both parts of the ending, especially with who dies - lame.

Read so many glowing reviews but I realized they are centralized in Texas (filming location in Houston); There were some nice landscapes and night shots of the city. The film stock looked decent, the sound has 2.0 and 5.1, no special features, would be rated R for violence, nudity and drugs. Gave two extra stars because Danny makes it look so believable.",1242950400,8,1367,4.571428571428571
8343322,5,B001UDPA8S,"""Boys of Ghost Town"" is deep, dark, and intense....But has a heart and soul full of passion.  This is an excellent story that comes to life with beautiful imagery!  This Shakespearean plot will tug at your heart and have you rooting for its main character from the beginning!",1241654400,6,275,4.708333333333333
8343323,5,B001UDPA8S,The movie is intense! It begins with with a nice gradual and dramatic pace but then quickly turns into a bullet fest.. Intense and heart felt.. Keeps you wanting more...,1240444800,5,169,4.666666666666667
