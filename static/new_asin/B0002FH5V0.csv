8027851,5,B0002FH5V0,"Although I have not seen the first episode, Tasmanian Tiger, I have seen the second episode ""Mungu's Revenge"".  The power has gone out in the Creature Club and the Kratt Brothers along with their tech savvy friend Allison (or ""Al"") are stuck in the dark, until Chris suggests they tell stories to pass the time.  First Chris tells the story of how the rhino got his horns, (with a reluctant Martin playing the egret, and both bros trying out horns for size.) then with Al telling the story of the platypus from the Aborigines from Australia.  Finally, the story telling ends with Martin telling how the ostrich got it's strong legs (with Al playing the part of the sun wizard.)  If you like Ttark, the dinosaur, then this probably is not the best episode to watch, mostly because he does not appear until the end.  But this video has the same Kratt bros humor (mostly with Chris and Martin and Al jumping into each others' stories), but also to see Martin in a feathery get up, and then change into having some modern (for that time) clothing.  Highly recommend it!!",1296604800,,1066,4.58421052631579
