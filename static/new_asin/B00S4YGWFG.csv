6958654,5,B00S4YGWFG,"This series is great!!  For those that remember the movie from 1981, this series brings back those memories.  There are six individual stories in each season.  Like the Twilight Zone, different actors bring the stories to life.  These stories are more adult in nature and a little dark as well.  Overall a great series with great stories.",1434672000,4,338,4.859649122807017

6958656,5,B00S4YGWFG,It came in a timely manner and in wonderful condition. I love this series very cool. I am a big fan of James Marsters whom in in the series I love the episodes that he is in.,1433462400,2,174,3.72972972972973
6958657,5,B00S4YGWFG,"Very very good.  I always liked Heavy Metal, Don't know who to blame for there being so few episodes. The SyFy channel or the French production company. Shipper did great, quality product.",1432339200,,188,4.875
6958658,1,B00S4YGWFG,"A big hunk of smoking metal ( Metal Hurlant) causes odd events on planets and spaceships  as it seems to rush around the universe to no purpose. The front story tells us it`s all that remains of a wonderful planet destroyed by it`s selfish and ecologically stupid life forms......get it ?? sound familiar..??  we better wake up OR...

The 12 or so episode's contained on 2 DVD`s  are  based on a French comic book stories , very in length and have decent if unspectacular production values and range from mildly entertaining to yawn worthy to just dumb. All are dreary, depressing messages.

 The English speech dubbing is decent to painful. Many stories feel disjointed, probably were longer, and cut with an axe in editing.
The title screen of each disc have several short teasers of very hot and beautiful leather clad woman in spike heel boots fighting,  and man -  hunks in thongs on thrones...none of which actually appear in the stories.  Maybe we will see another disc called "" The Lost Episodes ""...  BTW: The cover art  pictured above  is nowhere to be found in any story.",1431648000,10,1082,4.691489361702128

6958660,5,B00S4YGWFG,"A delicious sci fi buffet in the purest form.  David Belle, Scott Atkins, Michael Jai White and many of the top martial arts actors appear in this highly creative and fun series.  Can't wait for season 2.

6958669,4,B00S4YGWFG,I missed most of the episodes when they were on the SyFy network so this satisfied my curiosity.  The episode that will stick with me forever for how incredibly clever it was involves a man being thrown off a spaceship to conserve oxygen.,1456790400,2,238,4.534883720930233

6958678,5,B00S4YGWFG,"Well im a huge fan of Heavy Metal and Heavy Metal 2000 and Michael Jai White...no matter how great or terrible this movie is im gonna rate it high as possible. My only gripe is that i was expecting an actual series with continuity, when in fact its just like the Heavy Metal anime where u get a bunch of random stories based on the encounter of the floating rock. The stories are ok and the acting and special effects aren't bad. This is a must have for fans but movie buffs might not be impressed.",1445644800,2,498,4.197916666666667
6958679,3,B00S4YGWFG,"A 2012 French production, this 12-part anthology had its American premiere in the spring of 2014 on the Scyfy Channel. Inspired by the ""Heavy Metal"" magazines originating in the 1970's this half-hour of science fiction & fantasy was comprised of independent stories, taking place on different worlds, all passed by an anguished asteroid known as Metal Hurlant (""Howling Metal"").

Acting as a celestial harbinger of unpleasant change there were other subtle elements connecting these surreal tales. Notable actors participated - Michael Jai White, Michelle Ryan, James Marsters, Dominique Pinon, Joe Flanigan, Rutger Hauer - some reappearing in other episodes as different characters. This was a unique wrinkle that unfortunately wasn't always the most coherent.

The show had flamboyant visuals that were superior to typical Scyfy standards and at only 12 episodes I felt compelled to see it through. Ultimately, its efforts were laudable but too disjointed, and the dieing art of the anthology series is not going to be resurrected by this installment. Originally 2 separate seasons of six (22.5 min.) episodes it was shown in entirety during back-to-back broadcasts on Monday nights;

01. King's Crown - A barbaric tournament to decide who rules a robot society.
02. The Endomorphe - A surreal outcome to a cyborg uprising.
03. Master of Destiny - Premonition mathematicians and one mercenary's quest.
04. Whiskey in a Jar - A Wild West dilemma over the proficiency of the town doctor.
05. Shelter Me - A woman awakens in a bunker being told that the world has ended.
06. Second Chance - Losing a card game can have biblical results.
07. Loyal Khondor - Saving a queen and the elixir of life.
08. Second Son - Kings, castles and dueling brothers.
09. Pledge of Anya - A superhuman warrior teleports to a wintry forest.
10. Back to Reality - The trials & tribulations of virtual reality.
11. Three on a Match - An outer space lifeboat with limited supplies.
12. Red Light / Cold Hard Facts - A prisoner in a world illuminated in red. / An unappreciated archaeological find.",1445472000,2,2074,5.005797101449275
6958680,5,B00S4YGWFG,Good and thanks,1444694400,,15,4.333333333333333
6958681,4,B00S4YGWFG,"I like the fact that the stories are short; 20-30 minutes, about as long as my attention span.
Think of this as a concentrated form of Outer Limits, not a real life Heavy Metal.

They did a lot with great story lines, not too much effects.",1439942400,4,239,4.195652173913044
6958682,5,B00S4YGWFG,very nice dvds,1436918400,,14,4.0
6958683,5,B00S4YGWFG,"Good: A hardcore, wildly creative, 21st-century re-imagining of anthology science fiction a la Twilight Zone or Outer Limits. Only one or two weak stories in the bunch. Perfectly captures the look, feel and spirit of the Metal Hurlant / Heavy Metal magazines upon which it's based - if you like the magazine, or the 1981 Heavy Metal movie, you'll like this. DVD/BR version is worth it just to lose the intrusive SyFy bugs and snipe ads.

Bad: It quickly becomes obvious that we're not exactly talking Peter Jackson budgets or production values, especially when watching the Blu-Ray version. (In the future, Distressed Flat-Black Is The New Black.) Overacting is part of the panache here, but even at that the scenery-chewing can get irritating at times. Soundtrack is great, but can be overbearing at times. ONLY TWELVE EPISODES - sigh.

Ugly: The aforementioned weak stories are REALLY bad.

Bottom line: This collection isn't for everyone. Expect PG-13 to soft-R levels of unabashedly gratuitous language, sex and violence, along with bizarre, often-incomprehensible plots. Avant-garde SF fans will love it. Fundamentalists and pop-music fans will run screaming from it. If you're somewhere between these extremes, you owe it to your immortal soul to give this a try.  Five stars, and by Ghordjazz they'd better make more.",1436745600,10,1324,5.2018779342723
6958684,5,B00S4YGWFG,"Heavy Metal Magazine stories, brought to the screen.  Each of these are actual stories from the magazine, with all the twists and turns we've come to enjoy.",1436659200,,156,4.777777777777778
6958685,4,B00S4YGWFG,"For those of us who remember ""Heavy Metal"" and the Loc-Nar will find the premise of the film familiar as well as one of the songs played in a barroom scene. The metal core or ""screaming head""  of a dead planet travels throughout time and space entering and leaving the atmospheres of numerous planets causing events to suddenly change.

The episodes run from 22-30 minutes in length. Some are loosely connected, most are not. After watching the first episode I realized there is generally a twist to the tales, making some episodes overly predictable, like the bomb shelter episode.  Some episodes were really good, while others were downright flops. The episodes ranged from Medieval times to futuristic alien. One creature reminded me of the Orc Grishnahk. Many characters looked ""borrowed"" which wasn't bad considering the length of the episodes and lack of time for character build-up.  Five characters managed to make it into three episodes.

This is a Belgian production and sometimes the words don't match the lip movement.  3 1/2/stars

This appears to have been written for the younger metal comic book crowd.",1435881600,6,1118,5.043478260869565

8697307,5,B00S4YGWFG,"Odd but most are fun but dark Sf done on a shoestring budget with lots of Green screen work. It remind me of some old 70's SciFi made by BBC with solid novella stories converted into a script. I understand it's based on a french SciFi magazine that was the inspiration for Heavy Metal movie and magazine so not surprise. Only a few really disappointing stories, and that just may be a difference in taste. Some episode I wished were expanded into a longer length, Cameo's by actors I have seen in other SciFi about 10 years ago esp on SciFi channel back then.",1517356800,,559,4.384615384615385
