2349040,5,B000A13CBS,I show this movie to my French students and they always enjoy watching it. The movie is a great exposure to culture and language and the subtitles help along. Suitable for all levels of French.,1312156800,4,193,4.542857142857143
2349041,1,B000A13CBS,"I was very disappointed in this product and the company, Mars, that sent it.  Instead of sending me the French version as advertised they sent me an English dubbed version.  It did not even have the french and had the look of a poorly burned CD.  Not at all what I was expecting",1305763200,,278,4.2075471698113205

Asterix, Obelix, Verciningetorix and all the others join forces to HELP Caesar fight a challenge to his authority.  One word of warning - the movie is in french and if you don't understand french, you can follow along the subtitles in english.  It is true to comic book adventures with wit.  I loved it.",1244764800,18,748,6.831578947368421
2349043,3,B000A13CBS,"For those not in the know, the Asterix books are a hugely successful series of comic books about a village of indomitable Gauls who resist Caesar's invasion thanks to a magic potion that renders them invulnerable supermen. There have been several animated features (only one of them, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix really capturing the wit and spirit of the books despite being an original screen story) before a perfectly cast Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu took the lead roles in two live action adaptations that proved colossally successful throughout Europe but made no impression whatsoever in the English-speaking world (Clavier would wisely opt out of the third live action film, Asterix at the Olympic Games).

Asterix et Obelix Contre Cesar is one of the few foreign films that actually benefited from dubbing thanks to a witty dubbing script by Terry Jones that added jokes the French writers omitted. Seen in its French version (not included on this DVD, which only includes the dubbed version), the pleasures of the film are mainly visual - the perfect casting of Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu, the gorgeous recreation of the comic books' village and Tony Pierce Roberts beautifully rich color cinematography perfectly capturing the hues of the original drawings. The cartoonish special effects, much copied in Kung Fu Hustle are perfect as well, but for the jokes you'll have to see the follow-up, Asterix et Obelix: Mission Cleopatre.

Pathe's UK DVD offers a good 2.35:1 transfer with the dubbed English soundtrack, but the only extra is a brief trailer.",1242259200,,1583,5.155642023346304
2349044,5,B000A13CBS,"I was told that for a short appearance thar the ex ferrari driver Michael Schumacher will be in this film, has his voice was in cars as a ferrari car at lugis garage. i haven't seen this film in england but when its comes to us i will buy the dvd, even if michael schumacher isn't in the film, i feel this film is a crazy funny film in which these days not many have been made, some remakes are not correct compaired to the original some are boring or they don't come to the point about the film, but this one i believe will stick to the original story.i am not a expert when it comes to films but i certainly enjoy films that has no love scenes and nudity.",1183766400,3,657,4.022900763358779
2349045,4,B000A13CBS,"""Asterix et Obelix contre Cesar"" is a silly live action remake of the Asterix comic book series (even sillier with the English dub on), featuring bits and pieces from the comics, plus some original material, and live action versions of all the major village characters, like Cacofonix, Fulliautomatix, Geriatrix, Unhygenix and Vitalstatistix.

Caesar is checking out the conquered Gaulish villages, but his legions haven't managed to conquer a village in Brittany. The folk there, like Asterix (Christian Clavier) drink magic potion there, and it makes them invincible. Obelix (Gerard Depardieu), doesn't need to drink potion, since he fell into a bowl of it when he was a baby, meaning he's invincible all the time...

It's interesting seeing how the French see their own comic series, it's very quirkily done, worth a look if you're interested.",1169942400,,846,5.2592592592592595
2349046,4,B000A13CBS,"Asterix et Obelix Contre Cesar brings to the screen a European cartoon/comic all time favorite: Asterix!

Asterix and Obelix have their hands full in trying to save their village from a greedy charlatan who is out to scam the gullible country folk, as well as a power hungry Roman who has his eyes set on the mighty Roman Empire.  If the two Gauls want a fighting chance they must form an alliance with their arch nemesis... Caesar himself!

As a major fan of the comic book I was a little disappointed in that the acting and the dialogues/humor could have been a little better, but the plot, the feel, the setting and music are all pretty good.

Christian Clavier, Gerard Depardieu, and Roberto Benigni are good, but not great.

A Monica Bellucci type actress, like in the outstanding sequel, Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra would have been perfect.

In all honesty, I'll take the cartoons and the comic books (especially) anytime compared to the film, though if you're an Asterix fan you might want to give it a try.",1161129600,,1024,4.692737430167598

2349053,4,B000A13CBS,"Classic Asterix. If you speak French, it's great because the whole thing is in French. If you don't speak French and are relying on subtitles alone, there are several translation errors and typos to contend with.",1360022400,,212,4.916666666666667
2349054,5,B000A13CBS,Thoroughly enjoyed the movie but not having English as a spoken language isn't all that bad - the sub titles and replaying it is improving my French lessons at high school all those years ago.,1358553600,,192,4.514285714285714
2349055,4,B000A13CBS,"Of course, the original comics, in French of course, are still better than any movie, but they did a pretty good job.  And seeing Depardieu carrying a menhir around is pretty funny.  My wife and I definitely enjoyed it.",1358380800,,219,4.589743589743589

2349058,4,B000A13CBS,"My 18 year old daughter was introduced to Asterix and Obelix during a visit to France.  She loved them so much that she made me buy this. This DVD has English subtitles, unlike the Asterix and Obelix Cleopatre DVD.  Sometimes the translation is as funny as the movie, but it helps.  Asterix and Obelix movies are largely visual slapstick anyway, so even without the translation you'd probably laugh.  Don't be worried when you get the DVD and it has a Korean cover.  The movie is in French with Korean and English (and I think Spanish?) subtitles. If you have the quirky sense of humor that likes Monty Python, you'll like this.",1333756800,7,628,4.621621621621622

- Experienced noise and freeze. Product problem or master is poor, I do not know.
