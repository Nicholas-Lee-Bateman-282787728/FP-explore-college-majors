The actual D.V.D.  quality is okay only.

Goin Coconuts as a film is fun and fine for Donny and Marie fans. The accompanying film is very poor and is a poor accompaniment to Goin Coconuts.

The real bugbear is the cost of shipping for such an inexpensive film - I'm certain it could have been done cheaper.",1282089600,4,431,4.35
