549116,3,6303072259,"Benny, the perennial 39 year-old, was one of the best in his era, but times change and his style of comedy is now out of date.  Not particularly funny anymore.  He's still the best at deadpan, however.",1368576000,,201,4.405405405405405
549117,5,6303072259,"What can you say about someone as talented and watchable as Jack Benny. He was a rare entertainer. His shows with Eddie Anderson ""Rochester"" are among the best TV ever presented. In addition to being an incredible comedian he was really a good man who lasted as long as he did because he was simply the best. When Bob Hope spoke at his funeral he lamented that God only gave us 80 years of Jack and that we lost him much too soon. Long live Jack Benny. I listen to his radio shows on XM channel 82 and they are the absolute best of that genre.",1366848000,11,543,4.132075471698113
549118,4,6303072259,"I vaguely remembered watching Jack Benny at a very young age and this was more of a ""Golden age of TV"" experience than anything I have seen.

549119,5,6303072259,"I don't want to ruin the plot but I will say it is extremely funny and will make you laugh out loud even if you're not yet a fan.  Raymond Burr is funny as well and if you order other shows of Jack Benny, you will see that many, many ""Big Names"" in Hollywood made appearances on his show.  I only wish there were more, definately will make you smile if you watch.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.",1359244800,,403,3.8313253012048194

I really miss these greats.  So I enjoyed watching Jack Benny and would recommend it to anyone.",1350864000,7,282,4.384615384615385
549121,4,6303072259,"Jack Benny Program Volume 4: On Trial for Murder

Jack Benny was a popular comedian on the radio (1940s-1950s), starred in a few movies(""A Horn Blows at Midnight"", ""To Be or Not To Be"" ), and had a popular TV show (1950s-1960s). He seems little remembered today by those born after 1971. His comedy was similar to Seinfeld's comedies of manners. He often had guest stars as part of his comedies.

In this show Jack was arrested on a charge of murder. He hires ""Perry Mason"" to defend him. But Perry doesn't do as well in court as he does on his weekly show. [The wrong day of the week?] Finally Perry speaks to the jury about Jack's innocence until someone in the courtroom speaks out to confess to the murder! Jack will go free now. ""It doesn't matter whether you win or lose but how you play the game that counts"" says a successful Perry. What a nightmare for Jack! The humor comes from contrasting the differences in performance from the weekly Perry Mason show. If you never saw the old ""Perry Mason"" shows you won't appreciate this comedy.

The actual Perry Mason cases in the novels were better than the adaptions for the TV show. Most of the TV cases were written by authors other than Erle Stanley Gardner. Some say the real Earl Rogers was the inspiration for an Invincible Advocate. Rogers prepared his cases by doing extensive research. You can be educated and entertained by reading a book on Earl Rogers, or Jerry Giesler (who started out working for Earl Rogers).",1336176000,,1477,4.566037735849057
549122,5,6303072259,"Maybe I'm biased, but I love Jack Benny, I think he was hilarious, as well as a genuinely nice person.  Buy anything with him in it, you can't go wrong.  This tape is one of 6 released by MCA, you cant get these sketches anywhere else, including the cheaper ""bootleg"" releases....buy all 6!  I would love to see the Jack Benny show released by season, but that is unlikely......they cant even finish releasing All in the Family....",1250899200,,431,4.571428571428571
549123,5,6303072259,"This 4th volume of ""The Jack Benny Program"" from MCA/Universal provides these two humorous entries in Jack's long-running TV series.......

1.) ""Jack On Trial For Murder"", which has Perry Mason himself (Raymond Burr) coming to Jack's defense on a charge of murdering a rooster!  :)

Raymond isn't exactly acting like the Perry Mason we see on his own weekly TV series here, and doesn't seem to know what to do to defend Jack of this heinous crime.  As a result -- you guessed it -- comedy, and hijinks, ensue!

This episode (#152 in the series) first aired on November 5, 1961, during Season 12 of Jack's show.

2.) ""Jack Plays Tarzan"" (ep. #182; from November 13, 1962) has Carol Burnett guest-starring with Jack in a pretty funny ""Tarzan"" sketch, which features some good sight gags and Jack Benny as ""King Of The Jungle"". Carol was just 29 years old when she did this show.

An interesting behind-the-scenes tidbit about this episode --- While filming the Tarzan skit, Jack accidentally cut his hand (evidently pretty badly too).  But, instead of stopping the cameras, Jack insisted the scene play to its conclusion, despite the nasty cut. You can see when it occurs in the sketch (after Carol throws a fake ""boulder"" at him), when Jack looks down at his hand, but never lets on it's cut.

Jack, along with Mel Blanc, likeable announcer Don Wilson, and singer Dennis Day, always provided viewers with an entertaining half-hour of fun and laughs every week.

549124,5,6303072259,"Listen... You just gotta see them ALL. These episodes are a master class on how classy humor must be done. I did enjoy this chapter, specially the Tarzan one, where Jack can be seen cutting a finger in his skit with Carol  Burnett, but he keeps going on with the action, as if nothing happened to  him,  (this happens after a ""tree rope"" jumping) Buy it, and  enjoy it HUNDRED of times!",946857600,8,386,4.319444444444445

Radio and many of the stars of the past can point to Jack Benny as their sponsor and friend.  Johnnie Carson did a great take off of Benny.  I
love the show but according to our standards today the show moves slower and since it was live TV all the mistakes are there.  I would give it
a 5 except for the quality of the video. so I gave it a 4 star.  I used the search program in Amazon prime to find the program.  Thank you Amazon prime for bringing back an old friend.",1474416000,,611,3.6538461538461537

549986,5,6303072259,Benny' s successful transition from vaudeville to radio to television is not his ability to adapt to change but rather that  he remained Jack Benny.  A uniquely funny man even with just a look.  It's all here in this restored video.,1398384000,,232,4.609756097560975

One of the secrets to his success was that he gave the best lines to his guest and made sure they got the laugh.  I would have loved to have been a guest on his show.  I wish there was someone like him today.

These early shows were very different than the later shows, very formatted production numbers and a bit stiff in its presentation.  The later shows were more free flowing and natural to Benny's style.  If you have the opportunity you should listen to his radio programs.  They were wonderful and you could visualize the skits without the need for video.",1371081600,8,685,4.467741935483871

The writing is top-drawer and the performances - from Benny and his regular cast members Don Wilson, Bob Crosby, and Eddie Anderson as well as the supporting players (including semi-regular Mel Blanc) - are impeccable.  There  are a lot of laugh-out-loud moments to be found here.

The print is decent and the audio is passable - arguably no worse than it was when it first aired 64 years ago.",1491004800,,562,4.636363636363637
