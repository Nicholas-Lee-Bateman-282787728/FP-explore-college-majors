8405801,4,B003UAKEAI,"I was looking for a good foreign movie to watch and when I was browsing the foreign movie section at my local library (here in Blue Ash, suburban Cincinnati, which has tons of great foreign movies in its collection), I fell upon this. Didn't really know much about it but boy, I am glad I picked this up.

""I'm Gonna Explode"" (104 min,; originally released in Mexico in 2008; finally released on DVD in the US in 2010) brings the story of HS outcasts Ramon and Maru, who find each other by happenstance and immediately click. They run away, causing Ramon's dad, a highly-regarded politician, to start a search for the teenagers. As it turns out, the teenagers have set up camp (literally) on top of Ramon's (hence dad's) mansion. Sparks fly between Ramon and Maru. They feel like soulmates. But things eventually take a turn when they are found out, with dramatic consequences. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out, and I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.

In all, I really enjoyed this movie. Maria Deschamps as Maru has a breakout performance. I don't know what she has done since this movie, but would love to catch her again, she is definitely a young actress to be watched. No, this is not your typical Hollywood mainstream fare, and that's just fine by me. In all, ""I'm Gonna Explode/Voy A Explotar"" is a very fine movie.",1304553600,2,1356,4.599173553719008
