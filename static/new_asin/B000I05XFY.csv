8142640,2,B000I05XFY,"If you were--or are--a fan of the original series (plural), as originally aired on The History Channel, then this DVD is NOT for you. While tantalizing, this DVD is a severely pared-down compilation--a ""greatest hits"" in micro-form--from the well done, original series (e.g., in ""Wings of the Luftwaffe"" entire chapters--and aircraft--are missing). A nice overview, if you're a kid in a classroom, but it is totally lacking the scope and detail of the original.",1445385600,3,461,5.243243243243243
8142641,5,B000I05XFY,It's so fantastic and full of so much information that everyone keeps borrowing it because they can't find one of their own. It was just fascinating for me and my father who was a right waist gunner on a B-17 in Europe.,1391817600,,219,4.238095238095238
8142642,3,B000I05XFY,"I loved the show on the Military Channel and saw this and bought this. Yes, it is the same program, ""but"" I wandered why no info on number of DVD's and how long did it run? I have my answer after spending hundred dollars. It has only one (1) Disk and approximately (3) Three hours long!!!!!
This DVD IS A SPECIAL EDITION of the Discovery Channel program.
One hour is  Wings of the Luftwaffe: Fighter Attack.
One hour is Wings over Europe.
One hour is Wings over the Pacific.
Around Three hours long, but Terrific three hours to be sure!",1382140800,8,536,4.36
