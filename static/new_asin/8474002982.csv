Story lines deal with relevant issues (bullies, how/when/where/why to pray, etc.) in a way kids can understand and relate to.",1290384000,2,266,4.448979591836735
1172327,5,8474002982,Steve Green does a wonderful job of presenting God as a very close friend to children.  He's the One you can turn to and the One who cares when others don't seem to.  We have been singing his prayer song from volume 3 for over 10 years now.  It is a family bedtime tradition and our children wouldn't go to bed with it--even when they are really tired.  The day isn't closed until we sing this prayer.  This is a wonderful addition to any family library...very calming.  A great tool to help close the day.,1288828800,3,506,4.273684210526316

It is a great way of teaching kids what prayer is all about. I will recommend this video to any christian who wants to teach their kids about prayer. I also love all the songs sang by Steve Green and the kids featured in this video. Great Songs!",1281744000,3,420,4.197530864197531
