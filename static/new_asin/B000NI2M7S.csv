8454959,4,B000NI2M7S,"The video is rather long but does a good job providing the basic knowledge and equipment familiarity required for beginning tree climbers.  Geared primarily to recreational climbing, the basics also apply to the beginning arborist.  The information is presented clearly with closeups that make the knots and climbing techniques easy to learn and apply.",1368316800,4,352,5.5
