3534697,5,B001DMVZL2,"THIS SEASON INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING EPISODES:

Bug Out Part 1
The 4077th prepares to pull up stakes and move out in the face of a rumored Chinese attack. Unfortunately, Hawkeye is in the middle of a crucial operation and cannot move his patient. B.J. and Margaret volunteer to stay behind and assist Hawkeye--and, hopefully, stay alive in the process.

Bug Out, Part 2
The 4077th has moved out, leaving Hawkeye (Alan Alda) behind to complete an extremely delicate operation. With a reported advance of Chinese troops in the offing, B.J. and Margaret volunteer to stay behind as Hawkeye's assistants--and as moral support when the shooting starts. The question now is: Will the rest of the M*A*S*H unit return in one piece?

Out of Sight, Out of Mind
A stove explosion leaves Hawkeye badly burned and blinded. Faced with the prospect of permanent sightlessness, Hawkeye takes some comfort in the consul of a patient who likewise can no longer see. On a less somber note, Frank bets heavily on a baseball game--the outcome of which he already knows.

The Nurses
Fed up with the perceived insolence of her staff, head nurse Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan spitefully confines Nurse Baker. This requires Hawkeye and B.J. to ""invent"" a quarantine so that Baker can enjoy a long-awaited overnight rendezvous with her soldier husband. Inevitably, Margaret finds out about the ruse, and threatens all sorts of dire consequences--until a painfully revealing battle of words results in a deeper understanding between Margaret and the other nurses.

Dear Sigmund
The focus is on psychiatrist Sidney Freedman in this whimsical episode. Hoping to find an island of sanity during the Korean Conflict, the depressed Dr. Freedman settles for a few days surrounded by the merry insanity of the 4077th. In a letter to his ""mentor"" Sigmund Freud, Sidney describes a typical vacation amongst the M*A*S*H loonies, culminating on yet another practical joke perpetrated against the insufferable Frank Burns.

The Korean Surgeon
A captured North Korean surgeon, as weary of war as his American counterparts Hawkeye and B.J., Dr. Paik begs for a chance to tend to his wounded countrymen. Hawk and B.J. oblige by trying to pass Paik off as a South Korean--but Frank Burns smells a rat.

Hawk's Nightmare
It just might be that Hawkeye is cracking under the strain of the war. For several nights, Hawkeye has been robbed of slumber by a series of horrifying nightmares and a few spells of treacherous sleepwalking. It is up to the 4077's favorite funky psychiatrist, Dr. Sidney Freedman to solve Hawkeye's current crisis.

Exorcism
Bad luck begins to plague the 4077th the moment that Radar, acting under orders, removes an old Korean ""spirit post."" The climax comes when an elderly Korean patient refuses treatment until an exorcism is performed to remove the evil spirits summoned by Radar's ""sacrilege.""

The Colonel's Horse
Several medical crises face the 4077th while Col. Potter is away in Tokyo. To start with, the Colonel's beloved mare gets the colic; then Klinger is felled by profound depression, and Margaret is sidelined with appendicitis. By the time Potter has returned, at least two of the three major crises have passed. Can it be that Klinger will finally get his long-desired discharge--without even wearing a string of pearls and basic black?

Hawkeye Get Your Gun
Though worn to a frazzle from 24 straight hours of surgery, Hawkeye and Potter offer to provide assistance at a Korean hospital near the battlefield. On their way back to the 4077th, the doctors' jeep is shelled by the enemy. With the bullets flying fast and thick, Potter orders Hawkeye to defend himself by firing a gun.

Mulcahy's War
Frank Burns blows his ultrapatriotic top when he finds out that wounded patient Pvt. Fitzsimmons has shot himself to get out combat. The reaction of Father Mulcahy is rather different; eager to understand what motivated Fitzsimmons to injure himself, the good Father asks Radar to accompany him to the front, where he can experience the ""shooting war"" for the first time in his life.

The Abduction of Margaret Houlihan
When Margaret disappears, rumors begin spreading that she's been abducted by the North Koreans. Truth to tell, Margaret has ventured into enemy territory, but on an entirely voluntary mission of mercy. But neurotic CIA operative Colonel Flagg doesn't know this, and his ensuing ""investigation"" turns the 4077th inside out.

Lt. Radar O'Reilly
As the result of a bet made during a poker game, Hawkeye and B.J. are able to cut phony orders ""promoting"" Corporal Radar O'Reilly to the rank of second lieutenant. Unaware that it's all a joke, Radar nervously does his best to take his new rank seriously.

Margaret's Engagement
Having volunteered for temporary duty several hundred miles from the 4077th, Margaret sends back a radio message with some startling news. The former ""Hot Lips"" has become engaged to a handsome bull colonel named Donald Penobscott. Frank Burns, Margaret's longtime main squeeze, demonstrates his sportsmanship and good nature by arresting an innocent Korean family and charging them with espionage.

The Most Unforgettable Characters
Signing up for the Famous Las Vegas Writers School correspondence course, Radar takes pen in hand and sets about to become the next Hemingway. Jotting down his impressions of the week's events at the 4077th, Radar gives special emphasis to birthday boy Frank Burns. As a natal present for the irascible Frank, good buddies Hawkeye and B.J. stage a phony argument.

38 Across
Stumped by a crossword puzzle, Hawkeye tries to elicit help from his old Navy buddy Tippi Brooks. Unfortunately, the radioed message sent to Brooks is somewhat misunderstood. As a result, Tippi shows up at the 4077th with his commanding officer in tow, under the impression that the camp in the midst of a medical emergency.

End Run
Sgt. Billy Tyler, a former college football star, loses the will to live when Hawkeye and B.J. are forced to amputate his leg. Can the hero-worshipping Radar save Tyler from being overwhelmed by his own melancholia? Elsewhere, greedy Frank turns boxing promoter, arranging a grudge match between Klinger and Zale.

Hepatitis
Father Mulcahy is laid low with hepatitis, forcing the entire camp to submit to antiobiotics injections. The man in charge of this mass inoculation is Hawkeye, who has problems of his own thanks to a painful back ailment. Meanwhile, B.J. undertakes an extremely delicate operation.

Movie Tonight
A screening of Col. Potter's favorite movie My Darling Clementine is constantly interrupted by broken film and faulty projection equipment. When further showing of the movie proves impossible, Potter frets that the 4077's morale will hit an all-time low. Fortunately, the resourceful doctors and nurses are capable of providing their own entertainment.

Post Op
When the 4077th runs out of whole blood during a medical emergency, everyone in the camp donates a pint of their own--even the needle-shy Frank Burns. Ultimately, however, the crisis is resolved by the timely arrival of some Turkish troops.

Margaret's Marriage
The men and women of the 4077th finally get to meet Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan's fiancee, Col. Donald Penobscott. Despite the predictions of sullen Frank Burns , who still carries a torch for Hot Lips and is convinced that the belated wedding ceremony will never take place, Donald agrees to be married in camp immediately.

Souvenirs
The 4077th plays host to an unscrupulous chopper pilot who sidelines in a profitable war-souvenir business. As a result, the soldiers and the local Koreans begin incurring injuries or worse by picking up souvenirs that turn out to be booby traps. Hoping to put a stop to this, Col. Potter  must rely upon the craftiness of Hawkeye and B.J.

The General's Practitioner
General Korshack demands that Hawkeye become his personal physician. While the rest of the camp mulls over Hawkeye's imminent departure, Radar becomes surrogate daddy for the baby of an American GI's Korean girl friend.

Hanky Panky
Margaret receives word that her fiance Donald Penobscot has been hospitalized under mysterious circumstances. Also getting bad news is Nurse Carrie Donovan, who has been dumped by her husband. In his efforts to console Carrie, B.J. temporarily forgets his own strong marital ties.

Ping Pong
Hawkeye and B.J. generously shell out $40 so that the camp's Korean ping-pong champ Cho Lin can purchase a wedding ring for his sweetheart Soony Cynical Frank is certain that Cho Lin will abscond with the cash and never be seen again for a while, it looks like Frank is right.",1236470400,28,8629,5.1194879089615934

3534771,4,B001DMVZL2,"I'd been slowly buying these seasons over the years and they are still just as much fun to watch now as they were a long time ago. I wasn't alive when they first premiered, but I'd seen reruns over the years and grew to love this series. I only recently got back to purchasing them after the price drops and have really enjoyed rewatching this series again.

My only complaint about these DVDs is the fact that there is no option to remove the laugh tracks. I never liked them in sitcoms and a lot of the DVDs give you options to remove them. I believe my old copies of Season 1 and 2 had the option, but these newer slim releases don't.",1456617600,,637,4.178861788617886

3534779,3,B001DMVZL2,"I found the show both educational and entertaining some 40 years ago as a nave teenager. Having much more life experience, I now say- go to hell. You and the horse you rode in on. The Hawkeye character, such a sweet and superficially ""ethical"" sweet guy was actually a total cad, taking great sexual advantage of multiple women. In a real setting such as the one depicted, he would be fiercely hated and not respected at all, except by his male peers..  This is not widely talked because is was considered ""normal behavior"" in the era. Unfortunately this nonsense supersedes the rest of the show which is ok. So terrible that  programs such as this are the model for normal sexual behavior. I anticipate and welcome all the negative comments my negative review will no doubt engender.
Although the show attempts to promote so called "" positive pacifist"" values, etc. , etc., in reality we see a bunch of male doctors who either drink their way through the war or scr** their way. All  at women's expense. The occasional tearful and remorseful Hawkeye is truly nauseating.",1441670400,,1071,4.747311827956989

3534822,3,B001DMVZL2,"I had determined, orginally, to purchase only the first three seasons of MASH, as it was at its most original and fresh. The forth season retained much of the clever writing of the first three, but the cast changes hurt what could have been a great season. Larry Gelbart departed after season four, and it shows dramatically in season five.
The show itself and the characters were metamorphasizing into something far different than what was originally intended. Hawkeye's, at times rather cruel humor, was declawed, Hot Lips became Margaret and did a 1-80 in her personality, Klinger went from crazy to annoying, and Radar, from one of the gang, to a stupid kid. The only character that didn't change was Frank, and oddly enough, the funniest episodes of this season involve him. A real tribute to Larry Linville's abilty as an actor.
The show also started down the road to being a full drama instead of a comedy. As the show progressed it replaced sharp cynicism with sedimentality. By the final season MASH was a totally different show than when it began.
When MASH began, it was a comedy interrupted by moments of unexpected drama. By the end, MASH was a drama interrupted by moments of unexpected comedy.",1387065600,7,1208,4.8125

3534825,5,B001DMVZL2,"We were looking for a single episode of Mash.  My thanks to Amazon and especially a review that took the time to outline each of the episodes on the Mash Season DVDs.

It was to be a gag gift at a wedding (hint, Hotlips' husband in a body cast).  The DVD arrived before the wedding, at no additional cost thanks to their ""Prime"" program, despite the fact that I was asked to find the episode, order and receive it within 6 days!

To me this season was slightly weaker than before with Burns being rejected by Margaret and her nickname suddenly being dropped as well as her sudden compatibility with Pierce and Hunnicut. The wedding at the end of the season was really anti-clmactic as was the return from her honeymoon next season.",1269993600,2,576,4.887755102040816

Now to the caution. North Korea was very dangerous as a society of communists. Read the book ""Tortured for Christ"" (here at amazon) for how more on how very tough the NK's were on Christians in North Korea. This show actually slightly favors the bad state of North Korea during the Korean War! Also, North Korea started the whole war. Old Soviet documents presented by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1994 prove this.",1509926400,,628,4.607142857142857
