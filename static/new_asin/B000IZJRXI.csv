2664367,5,B000IZJRXI,"I really enjoyed watching this film. There are some brief humor moments at the beginning of the film which aren't the type of humor I usually laugh at. (Those moments were done by the actor who was trying to persuade the city council to unite the children of the feuding fathers.) But, that didn't detract me from enjoying the film. I especially enjoyed seeing Shah Rukh Khan.",1335312000,2,376,4.626865671641791
2664368,5,B000IZJRXI,"This is a very funny and well-done movie but a lot of viewers (judging from reviews I've seen elsewhere) never figure it out and so don't appreciate it. The keys to enjoying it: (1) a sense of humor (2)some prior experience with Bollywood films and (3) understanding that the police inspector is smoking something and having pipe dreams! This explains the over the top (even for Bollywood) nature of many of the scenes, which are not supposed to be taken as ""real"". Beyond the pipe dreams, the young lovers (the ""real"" characters) take over the movie in the second half, and this is just as funny as the first half - with some topnotch musical numbers, wonderful choreography and Shah Rukh Khan moments, and masterful Anupam Kher comic bits you aren't likely to see him get to do anywhere else. In short this is not your typical Bollywood movie but one that plays on those expectations. Either you'll love this one or you'll end up scratching your head and hating it. I loved it.",1218153600,21,979,4.632183908045977

8147994,5,B000IZJRXI,"I love SRK, my family have for the past year have been enjoying Hindi movies. This move was very good with a nice twist. It's a bit quirky in the beginning but keep watching it gets very good.",1428883200,,192,4.078947368421052
8147995,4,B000IZJRXI,"I thought this was a good mid 1990's film of Shah Rukh Khan's early films. I think it started a little slow but it got better by middle of film. If you are a Shah Rukh fan like me it is worth watching this film or buying the DVD, I think.",1381536000,4,238,3.6862745098039214
