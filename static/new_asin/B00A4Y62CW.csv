8546793,1,B00A4Y62CW,"I bought this item as we have enjoyed several of the episodes we have seen on TLC,  we thought 13 hours, 4 discs? Yeah that will be great, however I am not sure who screwed up, but this dvd is only 1 disc and 220 minutes long.  There are only 5 episodes on this 1 dic dvd.  VERY disappointing.",1360713600,4,293,3.9322033898305087
