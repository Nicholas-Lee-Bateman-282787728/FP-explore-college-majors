6866265,3,B00QFUFZZO,This is very scary for very small children. My 3 yr old watched and now is afraid of dark ,1429833600,,90,3.736842105263158
6866266,3,B00QFUFZZO,"Charming characters, humorous writing and interesting situations overcome this movie's flaws.  Yeah, you have seen these character types before. Yeah, they look like cheap plastic toys, badly animated.  Even so, this Spanish movie manages to be entertaining and funny, and even manages to have some visually cool scenes, in spite of its obviously low budget and character animation (especially painful facial animation) that will flash you back to the 1990's.

Sebastian is a young wizard with no confidence in his own abilities, but he turns up at the palace with a cat whisker in his paw just as the Kingdom of Mice is being invaded by rats led by the mysterious Dark Rodent, which apparently fulfills some ancient prophecy and makes him The Chosen One. He must now set off to the Land of the Giants to retrieve the magic crystal of Monkey Butt, which will save the kingdom. He is accompanied by his rock-flinging, tough tomboy friend Samantha and a pair of knights, one fat and obsessed with food and taking breaks, one arrogant and snobbish, who is disgusted that the 'chosen one' is a peasant. Along the way, Sebastian develops his magical powers and self confidence as he meets various challenges, encouraged by Samantha, and wins the respect of his knightly sidekicks.

The movie is frankly never very scary or suspenseful, but it was definitely amusing. The all-star voice-over cast does a good job with the dialog.

Younger viewers who have not overdosed on insecure young heroes with spunky female sidekicks who admonish them to 'believe in yourself' whenever the going gets tough should find this an enjoyable watch.

Older viewers' enjoyment may depend heavily on whether the movie trips your personal sense of humor.  The goofy dialog and situations kept a smile on my face, and occasionally made me laugh. If that's not your particular brand of humor, you may find it hard to sit through. The visuals and plot devices sometimes hit the 'hey that's cool/cute' level, but never really 'wow.'  On the good side (in my opinion) it usually goes for a storybook feel, rather than trying to be cool, hip and trendy.

In short, recommended for kids and families, but for adult viewers it may be hit or miss.",1424995200,10,2213,4.88

6866268,5,B00QFUFZZO,Super cute movie.  My seven and four year old loved it.  It had comedy and suspense and is perfect for kids.,1424649600,2,108,4.095238095238095
6866269,1,B00QFUFZZO,"My children sat through this movie, enthralled. I, however, was alternatively bored and irritated throughout the entire thing. This movie manages to hit every single stereotypical trope, a feat I didn't even know was possible. Weak, flawed, but ultimately noble hero? Check. They actually call him ""The Chosen One."" Long, epic quest that he needs to take to save the kingdom? Amazingly talented, brave, perfect in every way, female sidekick, who for some reason can't actually be the hero and must instead help the hero save the kingdom? Check. Ridiculously stupid sidekick? Check. Even the villain is just nothing more than one-dimensional and boring. It's also badly written. Like, extremely badly written, in parts. The most inventive part (the ""Land of Giants"") is cute, but too short to make up for the rest of the story. Not even Jon Lovitz, who I love, can save it. If there's nothing else to watch and you absolutely need to put your children in front of a movie, it's certainly not going to harm them. But honestly, there are hundreds of much better movies out there that both kids and parents can enjoy.",1424304000,7,1113,4.863157894736842

Your little ones will get cheap giggles at the repeated use of the nickname ""monkey butt"" ( the characters  are searching for someone by that name, which we later discover is a little kid whose mom calls her that as an odd pet name).  The movie shows no respect for kids. Cheap. And another strange element to this movie -- for all the juvenile references and humor there is a disproporionately scary bad guy (with a really creepy voice) that just seems super out of place and inappropriate. At the end the bad guy turns out to have been an abused lab rat but they just dangle that out there randomly - no point to it, no opportunity for empathy or for kids to consider what it is the filmmakers have just revealed.

8691150,3,B00QFUFZZO,"Were you to peruse the (limited) promo materials or stills of this one, youd likely be inclined to think its a grade-B CG piece hoping to capitalize on the success of domestic rodent-centric success stories like Pixars Ratatoile or Universals The Tale of Despereaux.  While this may be true, the finished product is actually more fantasy themed than expected, coming off like a low-rent animated version of Lord of the Rings.  Or perhaps even more pertinently comparable; think of this as a less interesting, poorer animated version of 2010s Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole.  With mice.

A Mouse Tale is a film with a laundry list of production companies involved in its creation, names like Grindstone Entertainment Group, Red Post Studio, Simka Entertainment, and Mandate Films just to mention a few.  The reason for this is that amortizing the expense of creating a CG animated feature from scratch sometimes makes the most sense by dividing it among as many parties as possible.  As such, this one is a collaboration Argentina, Peru and the USA and enjoyed global release upon completion.

Here in the US it received a direct-to-DVD release on February 10, 2015 from Lionsgate Films.  Budget and profits/losses have never been made public, perhaps on account of the many companies involved in the films development/ distribution.

The story sets things up with the typical fantasy trappings- In order to save their kingdom from evil rodents, Sebastian (Drake Bell) and Samantha (Miranda Cosgrove) are sent on a quest by the King of Rodencia (Jon Lovitz) to obtain a legendary magical crystal which has the power to defeat the rodents. With the help of two trustworthy knights, they must venture deep into the forest and enter the forbidden world of giants in order to accomplish their mission and restore order to the kingdom.

If this all sounds a little formulaic to you in summary, its certainly going to feel so in delivery.  A by-the-numbers plot structure, animation and textures that are at least a decade late and mostly forgettable characters (even the always-on Jon Heder cant save this one) all result in a slog of a quest that feels longer than its 92-minute run-time.

Is this to say the entire film is unwatchable, then?  No, not exactly- younger viewers may find the fantasy elements and the protagonists interesting enough to enjoy the ride and though it adds nothing new to the CG film fold, it doesnt go out of its way to offend older audiences with agendas or preachiness.  In fact, about the biggest crime the film creates is that it simply doesnt engage its viewer with anything along the way to make the trip worth taking in the first place.

Attempts of humor are weak and rely more upon lousy visual gags than they do good writing or comedic delivery.  The cast is quite stellar and clearly do what they can with the material but as is so often the case with English dubbed foreign films, there is only so much that can be done in post-production.  Keep in mind that what we call A Mouse Tale is in fact a redubbed and packaged South American film called Rodencia y el Diente de la Princesa released back in 2012.

In the end, the film attempts to redeem its cliche nature by tying some of its fantastical prophecies with the real world and some of humanitys best-known myths but it all comes off as uninspired and not near as clever as it could have been.

All in all A Mouse Tale, like so many foreign films given the dub treatment before it, comes off as feeling flat and listless from opening frame to final credits.  The story here has some merit, as epic fantasy works well in CG.  As do talking rodents for that matter.  As it stands, however, the finished product is under-written and over-acted.  There are worse CG films out there to be sure but this one has the potential to be more than the sum of its parts.",1487030400,2,3862,4.705794947994057
