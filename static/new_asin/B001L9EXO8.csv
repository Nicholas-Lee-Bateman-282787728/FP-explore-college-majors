3682787,5,B001L9EXO8,"Eloise (the animated series, from Starz) is a very good adaptation of the Eloise character, I was disappointed that there is only 6 episodes and that the series seems to have been cancelled by the network.

Anyway, I ordered this directly from Amazon.  It arrived new, and nothing was damaged during shipping.  It arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.  It comes in a box set, and in the box is three individual DVDs with its own DVD cases.  Each ""movie"" is about 43 minutes long.  There are a few special features, like sing-along songs, and the DVD can be used on a PC for interactive stuff and coloring printouts, etc. - there is an option for wide screen or full screen though, so that was nice.  Now, the box cover does not look anything like the drawings in the movie itself (thank God!), so don't let the bad drawing on the box discourage you from buying it, the drawings in the movies are much better graphics, and Eloise looks like the Eloise from Kay Thompson's books.  Again, don't let the crappy box drawings make your decision for buying it or not.

This box set has a Christmas one, a Halloween one, and Eloise going to school.  This is the second box set though, there's a first one, and that one cost more money.  That one has the other episodes - Me, Eloise; Eloise in Springtime; and Eloise Goes to Hollywood (that box set is nearly $20, and I don't know why!).",1328400000,5,1395,4.452755905511811

No violence, very little good-vs-evil conflict,the eight-year-old finds them unexciting but Eloise is her hero, so they work for her, and her 3-year-old sister enjoys them, too -- hard to find something good for both of them. Not the artwork of Kipper or Angelina Ballerina or Pingu, but something I'm happy to put on for them.",1327968000,3,466,5.144736842105263

**** Catalan-language Spanish film with English subtitles ****

This 2009 film goes by both Eloise and Eloise's Lover.

I just couldn't get too excited about this one.  The leads are certainly beautiful and the acting is okay... but it's a very trite angsty and depressing coming out drama with a sad ending.  meh to that.  Didn't care for this plot at all.  It's not available on Amazon but you can find it online if you look (go to YT).

The movie opens with one lead in a coma and her love story with another woman is told via flashbacks.  In these flashbacks, we find they meet in college when one lead (sia) decides to model for the other (Eloise, an artist).  The dark-haired artist is sultry and experienced and a full-fledged lesbian.  sia is girl-next-door innocent with a clueless boyfriend, a narrow-minded mother, and stupid, homophobic friends.  Surrounded by barriers and no one to talk to about it, she struggles silently with her bi-curiosity after she meets Eloise (an outcast).  Their modeling sessions grow more intimate when Eloise asks her to model nude and a deeper connection ensues.

Not much more than that happens.  sia was truly lovely and really captured a sense of innocence... loved that.  The ending looks like a mix of reality and dream sequences leaving you to wonder if it's showing what happened or what could have been.  I hate that.  I don't know why hot lesbians in a 2009 film can't just ride off into the damn sunset and enjoy a fair share of peace, love, and naked babies-- even in Spain.  pfft.  Too 1990s for my tastes.

I only recommend it for the beautiful leads.  There is lots of full nudity and maybe one sorta kinda graphic sex scene.",1414800000,,1694,4.632996632996633
