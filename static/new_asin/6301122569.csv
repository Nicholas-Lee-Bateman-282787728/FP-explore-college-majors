I bought it after i rented it and although the quarters and ski  scene are lengthy, it is still the best movie made to date!  I also love  the soundtrack!",947030400,2,312,4.15
316963,5,6301122569,"The following viewer is sooo right: Blood Lake brought me to tears as well. Well, actually, I laughed till I cried.

The movie looks as if it was shot on daddy's 8mm camera. All expense was spared, and there may have been no actual script.  Certainly there was no dialogue coach.

In between murders, the sexy teenagers go swimming and run around in bathing suits.  Benefits are two-fold:  a savings wardrobe-wise and delightful eye-candy.  The girls are perky and the boys are built --  beautiful to watch as they cavort and get scared.

They may have double-digit IQ's, but they're geniuses from the neck down.",942278400,3,612,4.761904761904762
316964,2,6301122569,"This film is about a group of teenagers who take a weekend getaway for water skiing, drinking and sex. The house that they stay at is owned by one of the young girl's father. A murdering madman (who owned the house before)  starts killing the teenagers one by one because the young girl's father  refused to pay for the house. I don't have too many good things to say  about this film. The water skiing was too long and drawn out and the scene  when the group was playing quarters seemed like it lasted forever. Good  looking kids but bad actors!! The plot was very weak and the editing was  awful! I gave this ** only because of the nice photography which was shot  on video.",915062400,,676,4.317460317460317
7810052,5,6301122569,This movie is so bad its cool. Kinda a home movie with terrible actors. For some reason I can watch the movie time and time again!,1463184000,,130,4.038461538461538
7810053,5,6301122569,"Just saw this last night at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, presented by Video Hate Squad.  I seriously could not believe my eyes.  This is the most delightfully wretched thing ever filmed.  I was laughing literally the entire time.  Best terrible shot on video thing ever made.  This is screaming for a dvd re-release.",1377475200,,319,4.833333333333333
7810054,5,6301122569,"I love this movie!! Even though its kinda like a home shot video, its still great. My brother and I used to watch this when I was tween....it was cool to see it as an adult and I still love it!",1223078400,2,193,3.731707317073171
7810055,1,6301122569,"I was shocked by some of the previous reviews. Is there an option to give this NO STARS? I bought this years ago, and I can't seem to get rid of it! A horrible piece of junk! Makes no sense whatsoever, especially the ending (what's with the whole freaking lake drying up all of a sudden??). Don't even bother with this unless you just like to be grossed out by disgusting immature spit games or cheesy redneck acting and dialogue (You a' gonna go out thar? Naw, Ah'm not a' gonna go out thar!) and no storyline whatsoever! It stars nobody and features nothing. Watch it and gag away!",1182729600,2,583,4.3577981651376145
7810056,5,6301122569,"Hello Blood Lake fans.
I am Karen.  Well I played Karen, I am Andrea Adams (DeLesDernier).  Blood Lake was one of the many horror films I made in the 80's.  I thought I left this one behind, but I love the fact that people think is so bad it's good.  I remember filming the quarters drinking game and the skiing sequences.  We all lived in that house for 2 weeks.
Believe it or not the movie was not the end of my acting career.  If you like this one you sould check out ""Blood Cult 2 - The Revenge"", ""The Ripper"" & especially ""Slaughterville"".  Slaughterville will be tough to find, but it is the BEST red neck horror film you will ever see.
These days I am the singer for a band called The AnAesthetics, based in Hollywood....",1057017600,12,728,4.231884057971015
7810057,5,6301122569,"OH MY GEEEEEEOOOOOAAAAASHHHHHHHHH...(cam voice) this movie is sooo awful and geddo and that makes it soooo gooooooooooooddddddd... its all about..the GAMEEEEEEEEEE..sorry, its all about these gayhead teens that go out to a lake for a good time and record it on a home camera, seriously.... there is one gayhead who is a hermaphordite, seriuosly, and tries to be neeeeasty with a spick...truly gross. well, rent this movie, its madd funny if you fast foward through the 50 minutes of skiing and blaring 80z music",984873600,,511,5.095238095238095
7810058,4,6301122569,"This movie seems to be shot with a standard camcorder. The acting is not professional. There are no stunts, no special effects, no plot. Yet there's something about it. It's in a genre all it's own. I love it. Because of the means of filming you almost feel like you are watching home videos or spying on the doomed teenager's weekend at the lake. If you enjoy low-budget slasher films, I highly recommend it. It's good for a laugh!",983664000,2,432,4.481012658227848
7810059,4,6301122569,"Just like another reviewer, I thought for the first few minutes that I had somehow stumbled across family's home movie.  I'm not even sure now if that is what happened.  But I just started laughing and kept watching and by the middle of the movie I was taken by the natural and realistic dialogue and and the honesty of the horror.  Everything here is funny perhaps because of it's earnestness but I can't recommend this enough.  The movie shows respect for the conventions of the slasher film and pays more attention to characters than any straight to video I have ever seen.  Someday word is going to get out about this movie, hopefully while the director is still alive.  He's no Billl Shakespeare but he deserves a lot of credit for this accomplishment.",975283200,,757,4.654135338345864
7810060,5,6301122569,"Yes my Blood Lake fanatics, it is I, Eric, the FIRST person to write a review for BLOOD LAKE here on Amazon.com ...and now look,  the word has  finally spread.  Of course, i put myself down as an anonymous reviewer, but  its time i come foward.  Everyone go out and tell ALL your friends to rent  and/or buy this movie, hopefully we can bring the Tim Boggs, Doug Barry,  Angela Darter, even the 80's metal act Voyager (who did the soundtrack),  and the rest of the cast/crew of BLOOD LAKE out into the public again and  have a cast reunion, BL convention, and hopefully even a sequel put into  production.  I myself can't do this alone, but if we all spread the word-  email, start a BL webring/message board(s),and talk to people we can bring  this gem the proper recognition it deserves!",967420800,,789,4.471830985915493
7810061,5,6301122569,No doubt this has to be the worst filming I've ever seen.  The director seemed to focus more time on the drinking habits of these young kids than any kind of plot development.  Not that it mattered since you couldn't see  anything that was going on.  I hate to even bring up the sad dialogue.  But  here's the sad truth...It all worked!  This is the best movie I've seen in  years.  I'm sure they didn't mean to but they made the funniest horror  movie since Leprechaun 2. I can only hope someone will see fit to make a  sequel to this.,947635200,3,536,4.207920792079208
