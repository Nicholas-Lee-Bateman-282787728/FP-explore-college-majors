2479384,5,B000E1E2N6,"The Charge of the Scots Grays is boggling, even recreates the scene from the painting. (one myth asserts that the bits were removed from the horses' mouths so that they couldn't be stopped. No creditable horseman would do that)The Grays blew out their horses in that charge while the French Lancers just sat there waiting for them to come. Thus, fresh French horses and staggering Grays.

In the British favor - the French had slept on their horses the night before to stay off the wet ground and later on the strained animals couldn't make a proper charge. Shades of Argincort when the French Knights slept on their horses to stay off the wet ground.

Steiger is a bit OTT as Napoleon but so was Napoleon. Plummer is just about channelling Wellington.

Incredible aerials of the armies setting up, like a giants' chess set.

I find the off-field scenes tabloid and wooden. But stay for the battle. The Cavalry eating away at the British Squares is brilliantly filmed. Wellington was in trouble at that point. Old Boney had almost won that battle.  Then Blucher shows up. In his 70's, barely having survived a horse falling on him several days earlier. He did everything but fly a black flag that day.

Astounding film of astounding history.  One of my great favorites.",1193011200,8,1269,4.740909090909091
2479385,5,B000E1E2N6,"Let's first clarify that the quality of the Russian DVD is impeccable.

This movie is an absolute historical jewel. I try to read up on history and everything I know about the battle fits this movie perfectly. I am not specfically a Napoleonic history buff, however, so I didn't quite catch the mistakes other reviewers claim, but I would regard those errors as unimportant. If I were to fault the movie for something it would be that it doesn't really give an idea about the significance of the engagements at Hougoumont and Haye Sainte.

But the real treat of this movie is the visual spectacle. This is the closest thing to actually having been at the battle that anyone can come up with. Computer-generated images may some day reproduce the view of thousands upon thousands of men marching through gunpowder smoke and kicked-up dust and distorted by rising hot air. But they still can't. The aerial view of the blue wave of French cavalry spilling around the red British squares is one of the most breathtaking scenes you will ever see on film. The development of the characters from Napoleon's hubris to Wellington's quirky stuffiness was absorbing. Finally, the movie's parting message that there is no joy in the battlefield, even in victory, was poignant and indelible.

I saw this movie as a kid with my father, and I now showed it to him and to my own son. My father was nearly in tears and my son (who has grown up exclusively with CGI's) was spellbound from start to finish. In other words, this is an enduring classic indeed.",1180656000,149,1538,4.688888888888889
2479386,4,B000E1E2N6,"This Russian DVD is the best Region 1 presentation of the 1970 epic WATERLOO.  It previously was only available as a Region 2 import, which would not play on Region 1 players.  This anamorphically enhanced version with Dolby Digital sound is the best I have seen the film look.  And, yes, in spite of what some reviewers here say, it is a Russian DVD.  The DVD was made in Russia, as was the film.  The director, Sergei Bondarchuk had previously directed the acclaimed and equally spectacular Russian version of WAR AND PEACE a few years previous to this.

As far as historical epics go, I would say it is more accurate than most.  I'm a Napoleonic nut, and can spot the innacuaracies in the film, but they are not that severe, and usually serve to move the story along.  All the great moments of the story are here: Napoleon's farewell to the Old Guard; the 5th Regiment joining Napoleon upon his return from Elba; Wellington @ the Duchess of Richmond's ball; the assaults on Hougoumont & La Haye Sainte; the deperate French cavalry charges on the British squares; the final doomed assault of the Old Guard as the Prussians take the field.

The battle sceees are spectacular, with thousands of men and horses thundering across the screen.  Many scenes replicate famous paintings, such as Lady Butler's ""Scotland forever!"".  The main cast members are outstanding.  Steiger is monumental as Napoleon; Plummer aloof and brilliant as Wellington, Dan O'Herlihy brusque and forceful as Marshall Ney, Virginia MacKenna elegant as the Duchess of Richmond.  There are other fine cameos sprinkled thoughout (including Orson Welles as Louix XVIII).  Some of the minor characters are obviously speaking Russian and are dubbed, but this is no great distraction.

The only caveat: the opening scene is quite poor.  They tried to cram in a lot of exposition to explain how Napoleon had reached a point in which he must abdicate the throne.  This scene has some terrible and archly written dialog that makes one think the movie to follow is a joke.  But, hang in there.  Once you are past that scene, the entire movie improves and is actually well-written.

The original Russian version of WATERLOO ran over three hours, and apparently included Ligny and Quatre Bras, which are only alluded to by a couple of shots in this DVD version.  One hopes the missing hour or more will turn up, but in the meantime, the 2 hrs we have of the film are spectacular and literate enough to stand on their own.  I rated it 4 out of 5, because thay could have mastered the film at a higher bitrate than they did, so some artifacting is present.  Still quite worthwhile, though.",1176076800,74,2646,4.754385964912281
2479387,5,B000E1E2N6,"I was very glad to have found this movie on DVD finally. I saw this movie in the theaters when it was first released, and have owned a VHS version for years. I discovered, however, significant changes in how this movie was edited when it airs on television and/or on various VHS tapes of the movie. This DVD version has scenes in it that I am not sure that the original theater version even had! I know this movie very, very well having watched it in it's various forms, and I can say with a certainty that this version has scenes that are not on any other version I have watched. The inclusion of these missing scenes are a welcome addition. If you already have a VHS or self-taped version from television, absolutely buy this DVD version as you will not regret it.",1175472000,16,766,4.363636363636363

Years later I bought it on video, but when DVD came out I couldn't understand why it seemed unavailable. Don't be put off by the Russian title here. The film plays in English exactly as it appeared in theatres. There are no technical glitches to be afraid of. This is a magnificent film, visually stunning in wide screen, wonderful musical score and fine performances all around. Bondarchuk is a great director and Steiger should have gotten best actor award. He convinces you in this film that he is Napoleon.

2479401,4,B000E1E2N6,"Though this version of the battle of Waterloo does cover some spectacular scenes in the battle itself, it seems occasionally disjointed, which is not surprising when you consider the original Russian version was some 6 1/2 hours in length.

2479405,5,B000E1E2N6,"I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and remember being blown away by it. Now seeing it again, my initial impression is confirmed. This is a cinematic tour de force. This is a Dino DeLaurentis production that was shot using Russian resources during the Cold War. That's quite a feat in itself. No C.G.I. here, 18,000 extras were used including 16,000 Russian soldiers who spent weeks learning battle formations and tactics of Napoleon's time. Rod Steiger is great as Napoleon. He just uses a slight French accent and plays the moments big. Christopher Plummer is also incredible as a very lordly, jaunty, civil and at times arrogant, Lord Wellington. He only breaks this facade once toward the end of the battle.  The rest of the cast is fantastic, Orson Wells, Don O'Herlihy, Virginia McKenna (of 'Born Free' fame) all put in fine performances. The movie builds to the battle and the battle scenes are spectacular and historically accurate. The charge of the British Calvary looks like a moving painting and there too many other outstanding sequences and frames to list. I noticed my view of who is the hero and who the antagonist has changed over the years. This is a review of the Russian release of the movie (which is in English) with Rod Steiger's picture in an oval on the cover. It's widescreen. The print is good, not great but is still high quality. Ignore anything you've heard about the soundtrack sync problems. The only problems were on the original print in syncing the Russian actor, Serghej Zakhariadze (Bluecher) to English. If you enjoy movies that portray historical times, have great performances, have spectacular scenes and are accurate and entertaining, BUY THIS DVD!!!",1486512000,16,1705,4.879310344827586
2479406,4,B000E1E2N6,This is one of the better Napoleonic movies made. The scale is amazing.

2479407,3,B000E1E2N6,"Gorgeous looking movie. However Steiger makes heavy work of scenery crewing and Plummer plays Wellington as a bon vivant that runs counter to the dry and business like reality of the character.

2479426,5,B000E1E2N6,"""Wellington!  Wellington!  Why is it always Wellington?""

That phrase, no doubt often heard these days in Hollywood board rooms, just might be part of reason that this 1970 Soviet production of the story of Napoleon Bonaparte's downfall is among Peter Jackson's favorite movies.  In the film, of course, it is uttered by Napoleon himself, portrayed by Rod Steiger, about the Duke of Wellington, played by Christopher Plummer.

English speakers need not fear the Russian titles; although this is a Soviet production directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, the movie was produced in English and all the speaking roles are British and American actors.  There is an optional Russian audio track with a Russian translator speaking over the English soundtrack.  The DVD that I received actually has the title ""Waterloo"" in English on the front, although the back is entirely in Russian using the Cyrillic alphabet.

It seems incongruous that such an expansive and fascinating film would only be available in used condition on DVD's from Atrium DVDArt.  The widescreen Cinemascope presentation of grand ballrooms and fantastic landscapes almost scream for a Blu-ray production if a high-fidelity print can be found.

The film is surprisingly historically accurate with a few compromises for the sake of cinematography and story-telling in the medium of a feature film.  Some real historical people are merged into one character the film to keep the number of speaking roles under control while still showing the key elements of the tale of events leading up to the fall of Napoleon at Waterloo.

I think it's fair to speculate that the battle scenes in this film lent considerable inspiration to the massive battle scenes in Peter Jackson's outstanding Middle Earth films.  In Waterloo, 16,000 Soviet soldiers portrayed the French, Prussian, and English armies with lots of smoke and noise to make the armies seem even larger.  The film was a magnificently impressive achievement for its time.  It was also one of the expensive movies made up to that time and never reached break-even in the accountants' books, which might perhaps explain its relatively obscurity in the DVD market.",1463356800,,2167,5.204610951008646

2479475,5,B000E1E2N6,"Simply the greatest and most epic military spectacle ever put to film other than Bondarchuks other masterpiece ""War and Peace"".  When I think or read about Napoleon or Wellington I simply picture them as Rod Steiger or Christopher Plummer.  That is how powerful and epic these two performances were.  My God, Steiger seems to have been born to play this role as he so captured all the eccentricities, nuances and personality traits of the great man.  Everything I have ever read about Napoleon leads me to Steiger's portrayal as the living embodiment of the Emperor.  The film's epic scale and awesome grandeur must be seen to be believed.  That helicopter shot following Marshall Ney's fateful cavalry charge into nests of British squares is nothing short of jaw dropping.  Filmed in Russia on a piece of land that passes well for the real deal is also one of the impressive aspects not to mention great recreations of Le Haye Sainte and Chateau Hougemont.  The film for me is faultless although by today's standards it lacks the emotional investment in characters that a film like 'Saving Private Ryan' does.  'Waterloo tells the big story in the same manners as 'A Bridge Too Far', 'The Longest Day' and 'Gettysburg'.  What it does not do however is get lost in too many character studies and an ensemble of dozens of stars.  No, this film places a magnifying glass on the two leaders as you watch the playing pieces moved around the field like a classic war game.

As for the dvd, well it's nice and it benefits greatly from the remastering process but why is this film not readily available in North America and why is it not out in BluRay.  A bloody crime.  Better yet would be a release of the original Russian version of the classic which adds an extra hour to the film and better fleshes out the characters and the moments before and after the battle.  This version has never been seen in North America but it is said to be available in parts of Europe.  I knew nothing about Napoleon and Waterloo when I first saw the film and after that I became a Napoleonics addict owning movies, series, books and games about this great period in history.

2479499,5,B000E1E2N6,"THE BEST FILM ABOUT A BATTLE EVER MADE.
Yes, it includes the events leading up to the battle; how could it not? And they are BRILLIANT, Steiger and Plummer have absolutely never been better. How there is not an American Blu-ray edition of this classic so they could make more money off of it is beyond me; yes, it's only the cover, here, that's in Russian, but I'm betting even that much intimidates people. FEAR NOT: as others have said, it's in English, and it's a meticulous, step-by-step recreation of all the legendary events leading to, involved in, and then immediately after the battle. There just has never been a movie about a SINGLE BATTLE that made it so comprehensible by the unique method of sticking to FACTS! The supporting cast are all well known; and even poor Jack Hawkins, using the difficult speech he had to employ after losing his voice-box to cancer, is just as wonderful as ever. Look, too, for Dan O'Herlihy as Marchal Ney, a genius supporting role and a big departure, for him. And Bondarchuk's direction, well, what can you say? The man who gave us the amazing scenes of Borodino and Moscow in Russia's wonderful version of ""War and Peace,"" shown here as a mini-series in the 1970s and still great, simply grew and grew in this movie, insisting on recreating every famous moment and even every famous painting of the battle (the Charge of the Scots Greys is so like the immortal painting that it's chilling). I had the chance to tell O'Herlihy once in his last years how much I love this movie, and he was almost stunned, so few people mention it; but when I told him how brilliant he was, he warmed up a lot, and then I asked him about Sergei Bondarchuk, and he kind of laughed in amazement and said, ""Well, I think Bondarchuk was a madman!"" Because of his insane drive and insistence on getting everything just right according to history. (Too bad Bondarchuk's Russian music video director son didn't learn the lesson for his recreation of ""Stalingrad,"" which is at heart a crappy melodrama).
In sum, if you're ever going to watch the story of one BATTLE, well: this may not be the greatest WAR movie ever, but it is the greatest and most accurate portrayal of one battle. GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!!!",1422662400,10,2228,4.586466165413534

Between the commercials and the commentary I thought this could be don a lot differently. Years later while I was watching Bill and Ted excellent Adventures  I saw and actor who  would Physically who would have made a better Napoleon by the name of Terry Camilleri. Years went by and from time to time I would think of the move the march of the old guard one of the most breath taking screen even on a the small screen. Then the miracle happen. While thumbing through Amazon move section there it was. No this cant be true. After reading the reviews I knew I needed to take the chance and buy it. Now after watching twice and cant stop help and think about the movie. If you notices the ballroom dance and Ney charge at the British squares the same hauntly beautifully medley. And then the march of the old guard with the high flutes and the pounding of the drums was more breathing that  I could imagine.

I can now see Sergey Bondarchuk classic the beauty and the challenge to make this very complex movie.

Here you can see immortal Plummer.  Why Britons do not equalize him with Olivier.  I will do that despite any objections.  When I watched this film, I was thinking who is better Bondarchuk as a director of this film or Bondarchuk as an actor from the War and Peace.  I would say I prefer him as a director especially of those parts when the ramparts are not only visible but also stirring our emotions.  Was Napoleon a hard cookie?  You bet!  He could do it because French believe in him.  When nation supports the leader he can go far.  How far?  From Spain to Moscow and still be able to put a good fight at Waterloo.  Pictures are clear and sharp (I used HD monitor).  Smoke is a real smoke from guns.  You are in the center of action.  What the film director says on the plan?  Action!  You will see plenty of it.

2479532,5,B000E1E2N6,"Rarely, if ever have war movies included so many ""extras"" that the numbers approximate the actual scope of a huge battle.  This movie not only has that ""cast of tens of thousands"" sweep, but very strong performances by some of the greatest actors of all time.  The brooding, method acting of Rod Steiger presents a credible and convincing interpretation of the overweight, frustrated 45 year old Emperor Napoleon who shocked Europe with a last gasp attempt to restore his fortunes. The force of his personality and ability to inspire confidence and devotion is easy to see in Steiger's interpretation.  Plummer, Welles, Hawkins and Wilding also do creditable work in depicting commanders.  ---  As a war movie, this one must stand among the very best masterpieces of all time.  Only a totalitarian state from the old Soviet bloc could have assembled vast armies of extras, expensive costumes, immense battle scenes and elaborate cinematic artistry without the costs associated with actors unions and bankruptcy. Bondarchuk made excellent use of such advantages.  ----  This movie also has significant anti-war messages conveyed directly by actors and also just by the gruesome slaughter scenes.  Created during the height of the Viet Nam conflict, the anti-war message was powerful.  I first saw the movie in 1972 and never forgot some of the devastating scenes and dialog.  ----  Although the box has Waterloo in Russian (as shown above), the movie and dialog is totally in English.",1401494400,19,1483,5.158995815899582

The Import itself is spectacular.  The audio is English 5.1 or Russian 5.1 Dolby, and the picture quality is good.  What blew me away the most, though was dat packaging!  The slip-cover is one of the highest quality I've ever seen and looks beautiful, even if I can only read ""Waterloo"" (the rest is in Cyrillic).  Picture quality was good by my standards; it's not a restoration edition and it was filmed in 1970-ish, but the film hasn't appeared to have suffered at all.  The audio is spectacular.

As for the movie: If you like war movies (like me), then this is a must have.  Rod Steiger plays an excellent Napoleon Bonaparte, and Christopher Plummer does an admirable job as the Duke of Wellington.  The small Soviet army used as extras lends a David Lean-esque epicness to the battle scenes.

The British scenes are not much better, they come off as pompous, elementary imbeciles, who are dancing at an extravagant ball while the whole of Europe is about to engage in one of history's most bloodiest battles, not that they were any different in real life.

Whoever was responsible for the English subtitles, however, should have been taken out and shot. This goes well beyond the differences between the production script and any adjustments made on the set. The lack of agreement between spoken dialogue and the corresponding subtitle is beyond comprehension. The spelling of place names is not simply incorrect. It is as if a deaf alien had been asked to transliterate what the alien thought the lips of the actors were saying. As for the substitution of honorific titles, let me just note that ""Your Grace"" becomes ""Admiral"" on this DVD. Did the providers of the subtitles think that Lord Nelson fought the battle rather that Arthur Wellington? If you are deaf or hard-of-hearing, I urge you not to choose subtitles. You'd be better off lip-reading.

Second, there are at least two different releases on Amazon and unfortunately these reviews are combined for both of them. If you are totally confused by the different opinions about the film quality, that would be the reason. I cannot speak to the quality of the Russian release because I mistakenly bought the Korean import (thinking the only difference was the much lower price) so this part of my review concerns that one. The film is horrid. The soundtrack is so badly off that several times, at first, I thought maybe the actors were speaking another language and it had been dubbed in English, it's like watching a dubbed Kung Fu movie. The film is grainy and is in an unusual aspect ratio of 2.20:1, letterboxed so the actual viewing area seemed very small on our 42"" TV. Both versions have been shortened. The Korean one is 123 minutes and the Russian release is 128 minutes according to the description. The Korean version is half the price of the Russian.

2479551,4,B000E1E2N6,"The movie is very good, including actors and how they did the large scale battles.

However, the DVD is a mess.

The first problem is that somebody took the widescreen picture and made a full-screen video file out of it recording the black bottom and top bars into the mpg file. And that mpeg file is 4:3.  That means that if you have a widescreen TV you will have black bars on all 4 sides and the actual picture is very small. You have the top and bottom black bars that are encoded in the video and you have left and right black bars because it's a 4:3 movie (technically, not picture wise).  Unless your TV has an outright zoom function there is nothing you can do about that, messing with the normal picture size control will not solve this, at least not without destroying the aspect ratio.

The second problem are the subtitles which have been made in China by people with an insufficient command of the English language, of common phrases and also of personalities and locations involved in and round Waterloo. Best of all, you cannot turn them off. The only good thing is that they are hard encoded in that hard encoded bottom black bar. So you can cover them with a couple books while watching.

In some of the battle scenes, they appear washed out lacking any detail, a thin vertical line appears now and then throughout the film and to add further insult to injury, no extras - nothing zilch;  Just the film in either English or Russian language.
This is sad really because this is one of my favourite films.  This spectacle smacks you right in the eyes, no computer graphics here, real men, real cannons, real uniforms, in real settings.  And the acting! First class. Bravo! I keep coming back to the word spectacular, it really is, and, when I look at the History Channel's cheesy Napoleonic war scenes in their docs, it makes me appreciate this even more.

The film is well done and for the time, when it was produced;avoids the tendency of large scale historical productions to represent action and substitute authenticity with adapted modern and available technologies. The aerial views are remarkable and the acting of the principle characters is equally so. I would say that it would be possible to view the Russian language version without losing too much of the flow of the history because of the direction. The character portrayals are revealing of the contesting personalities and in the critical moments of the battle itself, indicative of the margin of time and tactics, which in the end resulted in the historical conclusion. My only criticism of the film is that more time and detail could have been given to the battle after the climactic turn, providing more depth to the nature of battle in that time.

Every time I watch an epic of any kind that is based on historical facts my first expectation is for the movie to give me the sense that I was there as a silent witness.  Coupled with that I value high accuracy when it comes to plot/story.  Barring that I want to be entertained, not bluffed, and certainly not bored.  While this movie falls a tad short on the second it delivers the first in a grandiose scale that I dare say has not been equaled since or before.  It is highly entertaining and if you are like me you will hit the books trying to learn more about this, most controversial of personalities, enigmatic historical figure that was Napoleon Bonaparte.

The real Napoleon was quite an egomaniac and bombastic character.  Rod Steiger captures that, although from a looks perspective, he's much too tall and not quite as old looking as Napoleon was at this stage of his life.  Christopher Plummer is just fantastic as Wellington.  Even though there is no close contact between the two you feel the dialogue being carried on the field by their respective men.  The military advisers did their part, there is a genuine air of martial knowledge throughout the film.  Students of the battle will not be dissapointed as the main salient points have been faithfully captured.

This is a war-movie buff's dream come true.  Every little scene is like a precious vignette.  I find myself hitting the pause button to admire the picture.  There are times when I feel I am looking at a war oil painting by one of the great masters.  You cannot possibly absorb it all in just one view of the movie, you must see it several times to increase your appreciation.  The magnitude of the movie is just plain breathtaking.  There is one scene that I will never forget where the breadth of Wellington's army is shown, in almost a 360 camera pan.  They must have used a division or two of Soviet troops as extras to show row after row of British infantrymen.  The final charge of the old guard upon the Scott Grays regiment is just sublime.  I wish it had been longer as it was the apex of the battle but that is minor nitpicking and actually reflects the mark of a great movie: it leaves you wishing for more.

Great movie, I can't recommend it highly enough.  By comparison CGI pales.  I'm glad this movie was made then and not now.  Watch it, at the very least you will be entertained, at best you will want to own it forever.",1332633600,2,2505,4.486725663716814

2479577,3,B000E1E2N6,"And for good reason...

When the movie Waterloo was first conceived, producer Dino De Laurentis knew it was going to be a massive undertaking in terms of resources and finances. The  project was so massive, it required the support of the Soviet Union. So, in cooperation with the USSR, Waterloo was brought to the screen in all its astonishing glory. Enlisting Russian director Sergei Bondarchuk, the creator of ""War and Peace"", another massive Soviet-produced film epic, as well as 16,000 Red Army reservists, engineers, and technicians, the movie massive scope was realized. But like all epics, Waterloo does get crushed under its own massive weight. There were immediate conflicts with the screenplay, particularly from Rod Seiger, who thought the movie should have been entitled ""Napolean"", as well as the logistics of turning a portion of the Ukrainian countryside into a replica of the battlefield, resulting in the removal of three hills, the replanting of 5,000 trees, and the construction of replicas of the buildings and Belgian villages that populated the battlefield. The choice of Canadian actor Christopher Plumber as the Duke of Wellington was a masterstroke of casting, as he portrays the British general with the usual steely English discipline and humour one would expect. And this is the movie's biggest failure: it plays more to caricature rather than to historical fact. The French are portrayed as emotional bundles of nerves, the British as uptight or outrageously loutish, and the Prussians as near-psychopatic. The movie does get into scenes that are downright Monty Python-esque, as in the scene when Lord Uxbridge loses his leg to an artillery shell. One would think that he was about to say, ""Tis only a flesh wound, Your Grace."" And insofar as the movie is concerned, it was the Prussians who saved Wellington's hide. But that's not the official account, as was written by Wellington in his dispatches.",1316908800,3,1931,5.166134185303514

2479579,5,B000E1E2N6,"I saw this film when it was first released. It impressed me then and still does. I purchased it as a UK import years ago and this Russian import is, indeed, an upgrade. Watch it on a Blu-Ray machine and, even though its a DVD, it shines.

Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer were born for their respective roles as Bonaparte and Wellington. This film also includes other great British actors (Jack Hawkins comes to mind). It also stars a cast of literally thousands (the Soviet Army, I suspect). I also have Bondarchuk's multi-disc version of ""War and Peace"" and this is a worthy companion piece - better because it concentrates fully on a single battle. Although others may quibble about details, the uniforms, pagentry and sheer scale of the film are stunning. A film like this could never be produced today, and it is a poster child for the argument against CGI.

Some favorite scenes are:

1. the Scots Guards sword dance at the British camp near Brussels

2. The Scots Greys charge (and their defeat by napoleon's lancers)

3. The Scots Guards attack

4. Ney's fatal cavalry attack on the British squares (a scene reminicent of the final scene of the Battle of Britain film - those who have seen both will know why)

5. The final advance of the Old Guard

6. The arrival of the Prussians.

La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont are not portrayed in as much detail as I would have liked, but that's quibling.

One interesting observation is regarding the opening scene where napoleon's generals are stomping down the corridor to meet their leader. The scene was duplicated almost exactly a few years later in ""A Bridge Too Far"" - only this time with German generals meeting Von Rundstedt. I expect Sir Richard Attenborough was a huge Bondarchuk fan. With good cause.

There are a whole series on one liners which are memorable. The one which comes to mind is Napoleon's comment upon the arrival of Blucher's Prussians: ""I made one mistake. I should have burned Berlin!!""

I can not recommend this film more highly. If you like period battle re-enactments, this is a masterpiece - as good, if not better than, the film Gettysburg.",1311552000,4,2125,4.713513513513513

Here we have the story of Napoleon's ultimate demise, his defeat by the British Duke of Wellington at Waterloo (in Belgium) who was aided late in the episode by the Prussian Army. The Emperor of France had suffered a monumental defeat in Russia, where he had lost nearly half a million men in 1812 and it wasn't long before he was exiled by his adversaries to the Island of Elba with several hundred of his loyal guards to keep him company. [For yet another more epic masterpiece regarding Napoleon's win in Austria and subsequent defeat in Russia, again directed by Ukrainian director Sergey Bondarchuk, get this specific edition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-and-Peace-Special-Edition/dp/B0000714B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War and Peace (Special Edition)</a>.]

About ten months later, Napoleon escaped his island home only to return to France, there usurping a briefly-ruling King Louis XVIII [played by Orson Wells in the film], and again declaring himself Emperor. Almost immediately he had to face Wellington's challenge, the latter having picked his ground carefully.

This 128-minute 1970 movie is superb on several fronts:

1. The battle scenes are epic with no shortage of extras, all in flawless period costume and equipped with the appropriate accoutrements of war. All the troop movements were carried out in an astonishingly precise manner.

2. The cinematography is first-class, here depicted in letterbox format, (Panavision, Technicolor.)

3. The film includes several actors of The First Water, Napoleon being played by Rod Steiger who was perfect in every sense for this role. The Duke of Wellington was played by Christopher Plummer who yielded a slightly hammy performance but was likely inspired to do so by a somewhat lyrical script. Dan O'Herlihy also co-stars.

4. The filmscore by Nino Rota is quite excellent, very appropriate for such a presentation.
The film itself represented a cooperative effort between Bondarchuk and producer Dino de Laurentiis. This was perhaps a lucky thing since it meant that Bondarchuk was permitted to use the Soviet Army for the battle scenes!

5. With the minor exception of a little poetic license, the historical account of all that transpired is largely correct.

The packaging for this edition utilizes Russian language but all the film script is in English and there is an option for listening to the film in either Russian or English (with subtitles for either which can be turned either on or off) as you wish.

I have a interest in the Napoleonic period and this film does a good job of depicting the famous end of it. Rod Steiger as Napoleon is one of my favorite performances of one of my favorite historical characters. Steiger has some of the best lines in the film- many taken from actual historical quotes. His moody depiction of Napoleon is always interesting to watch. Not to be outmatched is Christopher Plummer as the Duke of Wellington who really does a good job playing the aristocratic Duke. Plummer also has plenty of good lines. He also has a nice scene with a foraging soldier. There is also a great cross cutting scene in the film the night before the battle that makes it seem that Napoleon and Wellington are talking to one another.

Dan O' Herlihy is also excellent as Marshall Ney.

The massive numbers of men are also a highlight in the movie. There were around 20,000 men from the Red Army playing the French, English, and Prussian forces. These sheer numbers without any computer graphics is just fascinating to watch. Ney's cavalry charge is one of the highlights of the movie. It needs to be seen on a big screen.

A proper DVD release is needed in the US. It needs to be anamorphic and also as full length of a version of the film as possible. Commentaries and any other extras would be appreciated by fans of the film. This movie deserves to be better known.

2479610,1,B000E1E2N6,"I hadn't realized this earlier, but now having put it in the DVD, I've seen the results of this Russian import.

Russia does not use PAL encoding in their DVDs.  They use NTSC just like North America.  And yet the framerate is badly and blatantly off.

To clarify one bit, you notice the difference in how video looks when it's presented in movies and fiction TV shows compared to News broadcasts or reality shows?  That's a difference in framerate---the News shows and reality shows and the like use a faster framerate.  This movie was filmed to be in the framerate of a movie, and yet it looks as though it was sped up or somehow adjusted to move like a television show.  As such, it looks less like a movie and more like a BBC television show or the like.

Maybe this contributes to this, but the biggest and most severe issue with this release that utterly ruins it is the audio and video is NOT SYNCHRONIZED!

Even a sneaking suspicion should be enough to confirm this, but it becomes hugely evident in scenes where the actors' mouth words clearly.  This completely ruins von Blcher's grand introduction at the battle, where he shouts ""Raise high the black flags, my children.  No prisoners.  No pity.  I will shoot any man I see with pity in him.""  It's so unbelievably obvious, you'd think he was speaking another language and having it overdubbed in English.  But no, he IS speaking English, and yet the audio is so badly out of sync with the video, it becomes a massive detriment to the movie as a whole, and rips one out of the immersion entirely.

The picture quality is nowhere near as clean and sharp as I expected, considering the version I first saw was not even in DVD quality.  It's smooth, but very much with a sense of being intentionally blurred, with a very clear and noticeable amount of artifacting on screen.

If there was a 3 hour version that was released in Russia (because I know the film was originally 4 hours, but then cut down to 2 and such), then this certainly isn't it.  This also has no bonus features at all.

If the Asian import has proper audio/video synchronization, I'd advise anyone seeking this work in DVD to get that one, because this release is broken.",1267574400,28,2198,4.516455696202532

2479615,5,B000E1E2N6,"This is one great film!
In 1992 my wife and I made our Grand Tour and one of the places was this battlefield. At the time about all I knew about what occurred here was that this was the last battle for Napoleon and the beginning of a peaceful Europe till the start of the Great War in 1914,
The pretty town of Waterloo looks like what it is, a suburb of Brussels, very pleasant. In the town is Wellington's office. The battlefield is adjacent and brings the visitor grandly into an earlier time. There is an excellent visitor's center with a wonderful film presentation and a view of the great plain where the action occurred.
I bought this film because I had just read Elizabeth Longford's well researched and well written biography of Wellington. I  was vaguely aware that a movie had been made; an IBMd review said it had not been well received and I don't remember ever seeing it advertised.
This film is so true to the written history it makes me want to forget all those C B de Mille historic films I grew up on. The only mistake (?) was a scene showing the officers at a ball prior to the battle waltzing. The waltz had not yet been invented, but that's picky-picky; the scene was beautiful with all its fancy uniforms and beautifully gowned ladies.

2479618,4,B000E1E2N6,"Sergei Bondarchuk's ""Waterloo"" is a fitting companion piece to his larger and more complex filming of ""War and Peace""--in a real sense the end of the story since you see Napoleon's last attempt to gain a foothold of power in both France and Europe.  However, unlike ""War and Peace"" with some of the settings looking a bit on the (forgive me Sergei) cheap side, this is an elaborate production with details, costumes, and winning performances by both Rod Steiger as Napoleon (tottering on the edge of genius and an emotional breakdown almost similar to Adolf Hitler) and Plummer's Wellington who apppears to be an aristocratic SOB expecting his ""boys"" to fight and die for him while not giving them equal status as human beings.  There is a small part with Orson Welles, as the French king, but it is so minor that one wonders why he is even there, but then it was partially produced by Dino DeLaurentiis.

Finally, while many of Dino DeLaurentiis' films are flawed, think of the remake of ""King Kong"", the man never shirked on spending on his films and the money shows in the fighting scenes featuring the Russian Army as both the French and the British/Prussian forces.

2479619,5,B000E1E2N6,"Well, I just finished watching the 1970 movie 'Waterloo' with Rod Steiger (Bonny), Christopher Plummer (Wellesley), and Orson Welles (Harry Lime), and some Russian fellow as Bluecher. The movie is a period piece, now in more ways than one. The acting is a little ham-handed (especially the scene where Wellington confronts the Guardsman who's stolen a piggy), and Steiger is workable, if scenary chewing Napoleon. Plummer's hair should have been black and he should have smiled less.

Anyways, what struck me is that Steiger's Bonaparte is really a metaphor for Nixon and his fate. They both enjoyed early success, then inglorious defeat and retreat, only to enjoy a unexpected comeback after rallying their troops and taking the fight to their enemies, who are many and cannot be reasoned with. Nixoleon flees Elba, off the coast of San Clemente, and as the Man on Horseback rides through the Alps from San Deigo to Miami, and thence Washington, which had been burned by the British the year before (1814/1967). Both Bonny & Dick enjoy the vast support of the 'silent majority' of everyday Frenchmen, so no need to negotiate here. When King Welles informs, through messengers, that Napoleon is committing treason by moving against the monarchy and its foreign allies, Nixon (I mean, Steiger) replies, 'he who saves a nation can do no wrong', that pretty much seals the deal. The few times where Steiger rages to his staff, in glorious self-pity or otherwise, are also faintly 'Nixonian' ...

So Napoleon steals a march on is besotted, dancing Democratic allies (the Eastern Establishment 'Elites') and proceeds to savage the Prussians in the election of 1968. But he has less success against the Havard-educated British & their German troops ('Nixon's Germans', a newly formed regiment in the Imperial Guard, had yet to receive its colors). Four years later, he decides to finish the job, and overconfident with his huge lead and initial success, he underestimates his enemies, who again are legion, hate America, and have long hair, sideburns, and haven't bathed in a long time, just like the Scot's Grey's & Coldstream Guards in the movie. Furthur, right before the battle begins, there is a scene where the British Guards drink gin, 'complements of His Majesty' (the ghost of King Jack), while Union Brigade's General Ponsonby enjoys some strong snuff with a fellow officer. See, I told you - Nixon's enemies are indeed subtance abusing, dope smoking malcontents who hate America. I knew it - damn hippies ruin everything, and soon _they'll_ be in charge ...

So Bonhomme Richard ('Bonny Dick') orders the assualt on the Washington Post headquarters - sans plombe! - located in the Chateau d'Hougoumont, where Naval Lieutenant Woodward & Captain Bernstein drink tea with Bergamont and lead their defending Establishment Guards by following the money. They meet with their couriers Diane Sawyer, Richard Ober, Patrick Grey, and finally Mark Felt in the chateau's parking garage. In a meta-battle that lasts all day, the half-empty glass of Chateau Briand and plate of Rochefort waver but do not fall to the deck, and the day is saved by a piece of tape, followed by another revealing tape some 18.5 minutes long.

Elsewhere, in La Haye Saint, where Lieutenants Jack Anderson of the Elysian Merry-Go-'Round and Daniel Ellsberg of New York Times slowly release the 'Bastille Papers', the Plumbers have better luck and stop the leaks by breaking into the psychiatrist's farmhouse. Hilarity ensues ...

Irish Chief of Staff Larry O'Brien sets up his command post in the Watergate Hotel, situated conveniently on a reverse slope. The Corsican Ogre sends the IRS, FBI, and CIA cavalry regiments against the effete snobs of British Line newspaper regiments, but the latter dutifully stonewall and form squares. The cavarly pass through the lines but must retreat, unable to find the Moulin d'Hughes.

Finally, exasperated & mis-medicated, the Emperor orders his Imperial Guard, in the form of his Cabinet, the Plumbers, and ultimately everyone else but himself, to storm the weakened and cowed British 'vital center', but the day is late, and upon command General Archibald Cox, aided by Sub-Altern Butterfield, reveal the hitherto reverse slope-hidden fresh Watergate Brigade ('The Tapes') and counter-attack, defeating the Garde Imperiale for the first time it its history, accompanied the phrase 'merde' and other Nixonian 'expletive deleteds'. Ah, the Garde ... slowly taking losses but somehow loyal to the end, refusing to testify ('surrender') and taking one for their Emperor and his Imperial Presidency. Nixon's Plumbers and Christopher Plummer are in fact not related, but it is an odd coincidence, is it not?

In the aftermath of the battle, Napoleon prays with Henry Kissenger, who wrote his PhD thesis on Metternich & the Congress of Vienna called 'A World Restored', and rides off in the horse drawn carriage 'Air France One' to permanent exile in San Clemente, where he gives interviews to his British captors until his untimely death.

2479633,4,B000E1E2N6,"I saw this on the big screen when I was maybe 11 and was awed. I didn't see it again until I bought it on amazon.com, but never forgot it, which says something. A rare Cold War collaboration between western moviemakers and the Red Army, this movie is a must have for any Napoleonic War era student or fan.

Christopher Plummer is the quintessential British aristocratic general the Duke of Wellington, and pulls off the role splendidly. My girlfriend, a huge fan of the Sound of Music, loved the costumes(especially his). Rod Steiger is superb as Napoleon, and the scene where he comes back from Elba and confronts his former troops commanded by Marshal Ney on behalf of the fat king Louis XVIII(wonderfully portrayed by a very large Orson Wells) shows the courage that Napoleon really did possess. He also sympathetically portrays a Napoleon feeling his mortality five years before his death.

The battle scenes at Waterloo are impressively recreated by the Red Army actors in accurate formations and uniforms, as are the decisions by Wellington and Napoleon that led up to the battle. Napoleon's later assertions of Marshal Grouchy's failure to march to the sound of the guns which doomed him to defeat is also well done, even if there is historical dispute on that score(after all, it was Napoleon who ordered his army to divide, not Grouchy). The charge of the Old Guard, Wellington's realization that he might have lost, and the Prussian rescue of the allied cause at the last possible minute is superbly done.

The little antiwar insertions may or may not have happened, except for Wellington's comment of a battle won being the next worst thing to a battle lost, but the film was shot in 1970.

The only thing missing from my childhood memory, as other reviewers have attested, is a little vignette about the Battle of Ligny. Still, don't let the Russian title fool you, the DVD is in the original English and is a worthwhile buy. I recommend the widescreen version to get the full scope.",1256342400,26,1995,4.790697674418604
2479634,5,B000E1E2N6,I have been very interested in this part of history for many years and a fan of this movie since it was made.  The cast is perfect.  The events of the day were thoroughly researched.,1245888000,3,182,4.171428571428572
2479635,5,B000E1E2N6,"Waterloo is a great movie, but you probably know that already.

I just wanted to comment on the Russian version of the DVD that is available.

It is great quality, no problem playing it. Once it gets going you can't tell the difference. You should be able to pick it up for alot cheaper than $100.00 however.

Stay away from the Chinese versions, I haven't had much luck with quality in the Chinese movies that I have bought.",1243987200,5,425,4.423076923076923
2479636,4,B000E1E2N6,"Perhaps one of the greatest quotes ever uttered, the title speaks of Napoleon after his loss at Waterloo, ""leaving this place of dead flesh"". As General Ney looks on at his departing Emperor.

  This movie is full of wonderful scenes and dialogue. Although no one has seen the complete movie in a long time; the pieces that we have are highly atmospheric and evoke the era very well.

  Perhaps one of the most impressive is something that has not been mentioned in full by other reviewers and that is the Duchess of Richmond's Ball. This was a true event and it is masterfully handled in a very romantic and aristocratic manner. Beginning with a Sword dance by General Gordon's troops; there follows a wonderful courtly ballroom dance enhanced by candlelight. The scenes regarding Delancey and his wife as well as Lord Hay and Sarah make for a very believable re-enactment of love and the urgency of departure for soldiery that speaks wonders for the tragic loss of youth and love in war.

  Another great aspect that has also been neglected by reviewers is the consistent ""inner thoughts"" of Napoleon and Wellington the night before the battle that are revealed to us. This more than any other acting brings to full light the doubts and uncertainty before the fight.

  Also the breakfast scene of Napoleon and his Generals, played to perfection by the wide eyed Rod Steiger as Napoleon as he asks inquiringly about the sound of the Church bells and is informed that the local priest refuses to give up his Mass, will we ever forget his response ""Well, he won't have much of a congregation.""

  Or the revengeful shout on the battlefield by Blucher ""Raise high the Black flag my Children, No Pity, No Prisoners, I will shoot anyone I see with pity on them"". Wow! So you see, there is no need to describe things like great battle scenes and aspect ratios, widescreen, etc. All you need to know is that it is a film you will NEVER forget and it is perhaps still the best film of Napoleon ever made with marvelous acting and it should have won an award for costume designs at the very least and Christopher Plummer as best supporting actor for his role as the Duke of Wellington.
Buy it! It's a winner!",1223078400,5,2201,4.607692307692307
2479637,5,B000E1E2N6,"This re-creation of the battle of Waterloo will never be surpassed. The advent of special effects means that it will never again be possible for such a massive array of manpower to be assembled in order to make a motion picture, and therefore the portrayal of this mighty conflict will never be equalled for realism. The scenes are stupendous and awe-inspiring, and make one constantly marvel at the sheer magnitude of the achievement and control of this gigantic cast. It is probably necessary to have some prior knowledge of the course of the battle, but repeated viewings will eventually make everything clear. The performances of Plummer and Steiger are absolutely top-notch: both truly give superlative impersonations of the two major protagonists. Since they were so different in character and personality it is impossible to say which is the better. The unfolding of the events, and the contextualization of this epic encounter, are also extremely well-written and directed. Of course, all the classic incidents and quotes are retained, which may sometimes strike one as a touch over-familiar: but how could they be omitted? An excellent balance is maintained throughout, and the overall effect is nothing short of astonishing. It is extremely difficult to understand why this film has not been more widely recognized and appreciated.",1223078400,5,1341,5.271028037383178
2479638,4,B000E1E2N6,"I purchased the edition pictured here.  It is not a bootleg, but a legitimate Russian release.  The packaging is in Russian, but the movie is in English.  When you first start, the movie asks if you want it in English or Russian.  It is a decent 2 hour version that is in stereo.  I do hope for a uncut, digitally remastered, dolby enhanced official U.S. release one day, but until then this will hold me over nicely.",1212105600,7,417,4.363636363636363
2479639,5,B000E1E2N6,"This is a truly remarkable film. I can add little to the earlier reviews except to re=emphasize that the available versions are significantly different from the original.
Steiger and Plummer are to my mind spot on. Wellington was both dour and very charming - otherwise he would not have been so effective as a ladies' man!

I remember going to the original widescreen version at the Odeon in Leicester Square - a truly widescreen. My recollection of the movie is that it was significantly longer, with additional vignettes featuring the Battle of Ligny, QuatreBras and extended cameos of two of the ""scum of the earth"" plus a build up to the death of the young blond enlisted man. Moreover, I have a distinct feeling that the cavalry charge against the squares is far longer in the orginal version. My hope is that the next DVD version will fully restore this movie.  Why not create a Director's Cut? Has anyone seen the original full length version since the 70s?",1208736000,9,965,4.738095238095238
8103830,4,B000E1E2N6,"The pluses--the spectacular, impossible-to-recreate sight of thousands of extras in battle array.  Christopher Plummer is perfectly haughty and superior as Wellington and Virginia McKenna in Regency ball gowns...rowr.  The minuses--sometimes muddy visuals (if ever a film called for crystal clarity it is this one) and Rod Steiger being a bit too ""methody"".  Still, it is something that will probably never be surpassed, even with all the CGI in the world.",1525305600,,456,5.485714285714286
8103831,5,B000E1E2N6,"Epic war movie with a huge cast of characters and extras. Retelling of the battle of Waterloo and the events that led up to it. Rod Steiger does a superb job as Napoleon.

The number of extras to play the soldiers on both sides is unreal. This is not computer generated figures, these are real people dressed in the appropriate uniforms.

This movie is expensive but worth the cost. They just don't make movies like this anymore.",1518739200,,429,4.558441558441558
8103832,5,B000E1E2N6,"Great old movie from 1970.  Excellent staging of the Battle of Waterloo -no CGI - real people, in uniforms, muskets, black powder cannons, etc.  Rod Steiger's performance very good (he was a really actor back in the day).  I was a little nervous when I realized with DVD was in Russian - but also had the original English version as well.  For Napoleonic War fans - a must.  Good color, 1000's of extras (again - no GCI) - rates up there with the old version of War and Peace (made with Russian army personnel in period uniforms).",1515024000,,530,4.422680412371134

But if you're into history of the Napoleonic Wars, this is one you must see.  Both Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer were superb in their roles of Napoleon and Wellington respectively.  Though an old movie (1972 I believe), it's still worth the time (it's about three hours in length) if  you enjoy historical drama.
