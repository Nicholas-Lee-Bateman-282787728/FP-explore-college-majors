So bad even the movie microphones slipped in on a scene or two.  So I started watching again.  The barf scene was from hell, geeees, was it never going to end.  Made it to the end and still had little clue what the movie was about.  If not for the write up on the back of the DVD case, I would still be guessing.  Not the worst, made me laugh in a few places, not worth the money to buy, very amateurish, poor quality acting, bad sound.  Only redeeming value was the nude and sex scenes, still not worth the money.  Buy something else.",1378512000,,653,4.0390625
8229485,5,B000XSWVGK,"I have lived in both Chicago and Seattle, and found this film fun. There was a lot of gay history and information. If you are an old queen and only like 100 million $ and up films this is not your cup of tea.  But if you want to see a nice story with a lot of  ""Eye candy"" this is the one for you.",1318550400,,297,3.5538461538461537
8229486,1,B000XSWVGK,"Sometimes you gotta distance yourself from bad entertainment.  Remember how Gore Vidal wanted nothing to do with the film ""Caligula""?  Remember that Madonna wanted her name taken out of Boy George's ""Taboo"" musical?  Well, I don't want this film giving viewers a bad impression of Chicago.  For a good, gay Chicago film see ""Outing Riley"" instead.
This film is disgusting and nefarious in every way.  It has really cheap production values.  The introduction has pencil-drawn sheep and a cloud with a face on it.  They kill time introducing every character slowly.  The sex scenes are long, boring, with no musical backup.  The main characters are emaciated.  They are equipped downstairs but still scary looking otherwise.  The main character says he was raised in numerous foster homes, and it's implied that he is of limited means, yet he could pop over to Chicago from Washington State without a second thought as to economics.
I try to support gay, indie films.  But this really enraged me.  And don't even get me started on the British, wannabe Divine who does nothing for the plot, but is all over the place in the film.  One trillion thumbs down.",1206403200,4,1153,4.876288659793815
