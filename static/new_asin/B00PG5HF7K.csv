8687754,5,B00PG5HF7K,"This set of yoga DVDs are beautiful and relaxing. I'm a bit of a beginner when it comes to yoga. I have done Bikram yoga many times at different studios, but have only recently started doing yoga at home and these videos are wonderful. They are very well made, have beautiful scenery, which may sound odd for a yoga video, but it makes it easy and fun to follow.  This season is a bit different than the first two seasons, but I really like this season as I have liked the previous two seasons as well.  If this season was the same as the previous two then I would probably just watch those, but I like that this season is a bit different to change things up.",1459209600,,659,4.181102362204724
8687755,5,B00PG5HF7K,"I aim to do yoga every day. Sometimes it's a class at a studio, sometimes it's my self guided practice and sometimes it's a video. I have varying amounts of time to devote to my practice. I often have to squeeze a little in on busy days, which is exactly why I love this video. The 22 minute practices are perfect for a morning or nighttime routine, or just squeezing a sequence in while my son is napping. I often string together a couple sequences to make a 45 minute session.

These sequences have a couple things I really enjoy. First, I can't speak highly enough of the scenery. This definitely helps me get into the mood. I feel transformed out of my family room and into the beautiful scenes featured. I am a pacific northwest resident, so I really feel at home with the scenery. The transitions from scene to scene are flawless and don't distract at all from the practice. The amount of time spent filming and editing these episodes is mind boggling.

Second, I love the actual episodes and variety. There is a brief warm up and cool down with every episode. The bulk of it is the actual workout. Each episode has a focus, such as ""twists"", but I have to say that it doesn't focus exclusively on that one type of exercise. There is still a nice variety of stretches in each episode. I like putting a couple workouts together. I am posting a picture of the menu's so you can see how easy it is to just skip the warm up or cool down and do multiple main sequences.

Lastly, I love that this isn't a step by step guide on how to do yoga. That may be a turn off for some, but I get tired of watching videos where I have to rehash every single time I watch it the correct way to preform each posture. I have one video that goes into depth on the correct way to do each pose and after doing it a couple times I grew tired of the chatter and gave it to a friend. This video gives some brief instructions, but it relies on having some basic knowledge of correct form. I recommend getting a beginners video if you've never done yoga before like Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners

Overall, I see a wonderful value in these episodes for a light, fun yoga practice. I enjoy using them for brief practices. I alternate them with some of the power yoga DVD's I enjoy and yoga classes. I was sent this DVD for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on the rating or review I am giving it. I always review products honestly based on my experience with them. This is a just a solid DVD with wonderful,. short sequences for the beginner-intermediate yogi.",1455494400,,2553,4.3125
8687756,5,B00PG5HF7K,"I must admit that the Namaste TV videos are highly addictive. When I first got on the mat to try them I was planning on doing 1 or 2 a day until I had worked through the season. But I could not stop I did the 13 episodes in season 3 in 2 days and know I will be incorporating them in my practice often. I am always open to trying new yoga teachers and styles. That being said, the style in these videos is very different from what I would normally practice or even what I myself teach. These are very different from the DDP Yoga that I usually practice and teach, and maybe that is what makes them so good for me. I find that with my personal practice and almost daily mat time something new and different is invigorating and renews my love and passion for time on the mat, Namaste Yoga does that!

On Namaste TV's website the description for this season is that it ""is more than just an exercise video - it's an experience that will calm your mind, strengthen your body and inspire your soul. Master yoga teacher Erica Blitz guides you through 13 classes, all filmed amid the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest."" And does it ever deliver on that promise the 4k resolution and stunning cinematography really enhance the practice. Give it a try you will not be disappointed! Here are mini reviews of each of the 7 videos in this set:

Episode 307 Balance and Bend
Balance and Connect
This video has an awesome warmup. There is the addition of mudra's for the first time this season. The balance sequence is just wonderful. One of my favorite video's in the whole season.

Episode 308 Bhakti Flow
Open Your Upper Back and Shoulders
This is another of my favorites from the series. Even without the guided transition from warmup to flow. There are a lot of eagle arm variations in this sequence and also a few full eagle poses. Just an excellent flow!

Episode 309 Open and Ground
Stretch Your Shoulders and
Strengthen Your Upper Back
This was one of the hardest flows in the series. It is a great sequence. A number of sphinx and dolphin poses add a lot of variety into this video. This one is intense compared to some of the others.

Episode 310 Stabilize and Center
Strengthen Your Core and Open Your Hips
This was a good flow. It combines elements used in many of the others. I enjoy the subtle variations offered across the different videos in the series. Could really feel this one in the core after all the boat poses.

Episode 311 Prana Flow
Open Your Shoulders and Hips
This was nearly a perfect flow. It was seamless from warmup into flow to cool down. Absolutely wonderful practice. Loved this one.

Episode 312 Grace and Gratitude
Backbending Practice
This was a good practice. But from other practices I have done the backbending was pretty minimal. I was concerned before beginning what the backbending would included but there was nothing to be concerned about. It is good but not one of my favorites.

Episode 313 Reconnect and Refine
Hip Opening and Abdominal Strengthening
We encounter full bow pose for the first time this season. There is a lot of time on the mat, and far less standing work in this sequence. Physically it is much more demanding than some of the other videos.

The length of these videos at 22 minutes each is excellent for short practice or stinging them together into a longer session. You can also combine them with other practice to round out your time on the mat. Some of the sequences start to feel familiar across the videos but that is to be expected and in many ways is a benefit as you become more and more familiar with Erica's style. The Top Pros and Cons of these videos are:

Pros:
Wonderful flows
Amazing cinematography
Incredible production quality
4K resolution for large displays
Focus on balancing both sides in poses others often do not

Cons:
All women cast
Very few modifications offered

These are excellent classes and I can honestly highly recommend them. These 7 classes were great. I really enjoyed them and know I will come back to them often and frequently include them in my practice. The cinematography is incredible, following the same flow with between one and three examples on screen, in city scapes, nature, on water and a few industrial locations. The videos are amazing to watch and practice along with. Tim McCauley's original compositions perfectly accompany both the practice and videography. And I am looking forward to trying more from Namaste TV. If you give them a try with an open mind and heart they will defiantly enhance your personal practice.",1445644800,3,4533,4.603469640644362
8687757,1,B00PG5HF7K,"I was seriously excited when I discovered Season Three was finally available!  I have raved elsewhere about Seasons One and Two, and I was so looking forward to the next installment!  What happened, Namaste?  What were you thinking?  You started with such a high quality product (HD would have been even better!) I suppose some regression to the mean was inevitable, but such an extensive fall from grace?  The first two discs of Season Three that I received had multiple places where they skipped.  The good folks at Namaste were a pleasure to work with and obviously care about having a good product.  They sent me replacements as soon as they were available.  I trust that they should be ok now, but to be honest, I have yet to look at them.  You see, the portions that *did* play on the defective discs were a disappointment.  To be sure, there are a few scenes that are absolutely beautiful, the candle lit dojo with it snowing outside comes to mind.  But I didn't get these discs for pretty scenery, I wanted them for yoga exercise inspiration.  There are multiple problems.  What had been a minor nuisance in the first two seasons rose to the level of a near pathology in this set.  It looks as though the film editor was being paid by the number of transitions he/she made per minute.  Really?  You should not, as a rule, make a transition edit while your subject is moving.  Do it while they are still.  That way, the viewer doesn't miss how the subject moves from one pose to another.  And make transitions far less often... maybe half as many?  Close-ups of hands pointing to the sky, or smiling faces may be very pretty, but do not add much useful yoga information.  Showing the entire pose would be nice.  It's almost as if the editors/film crew thought that the human body should be hidden or obscured by only showing isolated parts while quickly and constantly transitioning from one shot to another.  Ugh.  The Yoginnis in the first two seasons were almost like dancers as they moved through the poses led by Kate Potter.  In season three, the magic is gone.  Please!  Get the original team back and make those outstanding routines again! --- from a sincere fan of the series.  One of the things I have noticed is that I need to be careful relying on just a few reviews.  Who doesn't have four or five friends?",1427500800,,2326,4.550724637681159
8687758,5,B00PG5HF7K,Fantastic...wasn't sure i would love not having kate potter but although it is different it is just as great.,1423180800,,109,4.7894736842105265
8687759,5,B00PG5HF7K,This like part one is wonderful.  I have done the other seasons so much I was bored.  This new teacher is great and does not repeat move after move like Kate Potter did.  It flows fast and she has great poses that push the balance even further.  These are not beginner videos but not advanced either.  I was long passed the other videos and this is refreshing I hope they make lots more.,1421366400,6,387,4.2465753424657535
8687760,4,B00PG5HF7K,"Terrific DVDs -- well made, and offer good instruction. Fun to watch and follow along.",1420934400,2,86,4.8
8687761,4,B00PG5HF7K,"Seasons 1 and 2 are better, I expected more directions about the movements.  Nothing new.",1420588800,,89,4.933333333333334
8687762,5,B00PG5HF7K,I know these new seasons are not like the last two but this one in particular has a lot of great poses! Erica Blitz is just a different teacher than Kate Potter but after doing the first two seasons for so long it is nice to have something new. At first I thought I would have to look at the tv a lot but then you start to get used to the flows she uses in both dvds. She covers a lot of ground in part 2!,1420588800,4,405,3.6666666666666665
