5528788,5,B00AZ2N906,"I really cannot say enough about Jessica & her workout style. Who else creates workouts that you only need about 5 feet of space, yet sweat like you've run a five miles.  This is fun, feel like Im dancing. I have never felt so invigorated in my life. And this is for ALL fitness level! Keep it up, Jessica!! Love your stuff!!  Bravo!!",1361491200,3,334,4.285714285714286
5528789,5,B00AZ2N906,"I discovered Jessica via her You Tube TV Channel and Facebook and started working out with her a week ago. I was looking for the missing link. While I workout most days doing barre and pilates type workouts I had never thought about walking. Since I don't get to be out and about as much this time of year I decided to take up walking and so happy I found Jessica. She is very down to earth, pleasant to watch and listen to. This is for beginner to advanced and set in sunny Miami which instantly makes me happy to think I am 'back home'. There are modifications if you follow one of the others if you want to make this a bit harder. I am now doing this everyday and it just adds that little bit extra cardio I need. I really look forward to doing this, so much so I am going to do her other DVD's, even though I don't need to lose weight they are still a great addition to any workout you may be doing. There is nothing worse than dreading working out but with Jessica, you will look forward to it. I love the moves, I love the upbeat Latin music, the setting, just everything about it. You won't regret this!",1361491200,23,1110,4.119815668202765
5528790,5,B00AZ2N906,"My preference is to walk outside but in the dead of winter or in hot summer weather, I rely on dvds for cardio.  I have long wondered why more instructors don't make low impact cardio or walking dvds.  There is not much out there if you need a little break from Leslie Sansone.  Thank you Jessica!

I did this workout from start to finish and it clocked in at 72 minutes:
5:30 warmup
30:00 High Energy Walk
30:00 Power Walk
6:30 Cool down and stretch

The dvd was filmed in a sunny outdoor setting.  Jessica and her two modifiers are standing on round platforms set in sand, with a white building in the background.  The modifier to the left does more advanced options and the one to the right takes everything down a notch.  Jessica stays with the intermediate option throughout both walks.  The steps are fairly easy to follow and there are a lot of arm movements to keep your heart rate up.  The High Energy walk is steady state cardio with more variety in the steps than the Power Walk.  I really liked the music in the High Energy Walk.  The Power Walk incorporates some intervals with higher impact options such as jogging and jumping jacks as an option.  I have a rebounder (mini trampoline) and I think the Power Walk could be very easily adapted to that.  I really enjoyed both walks on this dvd.  If I do the walks back to back again, I will reverse the order so that I have more energy for the intervals.

Jessica is very upbeat and encouraging and there is no talk of losing 10 pounds in a month or getting in shape for your bikini.  I recently discovered her workouts on Youtube (her channel is Jessicasmithtv).  I've been looking forward to working out with Jessica almost daily for the last two months at a time of year when I usually lose my motivation.  I hope to see more of the Youtube workouts on dvd as she offers such a great variety of fun free workouts.",1361491200,79,1877,4.372832369942197

5528805,4,B00AZ2N906,"Hi!  I'm 43...big fan of Jessica's.  I just bought this DVD along with 2 others (needed to update my DVD collection).  Here's a breakdown of my thoughts while doing this DVD.
Warm up:  Decent!  I felt stretched and ready for the workout.  Missed seeing her mom and her friend.  However, the mother daughter team that were with her were nice.
High Energy Walk: I was totally bored with this 30 min. Walk.  This is the sole reason I didn't give this 5 stars.  To me, this would be perfect for those days when I am PMS'ing and just want to move around a little.  In fact, I felt like I needed an additional challenge so I went immediately into the next segment.
Power Walk:  This DVD totally redeemed itself with this 30 minutes.  I loved it.  I was able to follow Asha, doing all the power moves she did and I felt great afterwards.  Totally sweaty, totally fulfilled with my cardio for today.  This segment was great!
Cool Down: Perfect!  It hit all the major muscle groups.
In summary, I will rotate this DVD along with all the other Jessica Smith dvd's I own.  I am not sorry I purchased this at all and would recommend it.",1463529600,14,1124,4.352657004830918
5528806,2,B00AZ2N906,"This is my first DVD by Jessica.  I was very disappointed.  The workout very repetitive in my opinion.  I prefer a little more choreography in a cardio workout.  I bought this DVD for days I need ""easier"" cardio ( I do Amy Bento, Cathe Freidrich, and Zumba)  For easier days I've been doing Kathy Smith or Leslie Sansone and wanted something different.  Jessica has some great reviews so I thought I'd give her a try.  Jessica has great camera presence, and cues very well, but I just didn't like this DVD at all.",1463529600,2,513,4.451612903225806
5528807,5,B00AZ2N906,"Jessica Smith never disappoints!  This work out was actually tough for me and I found myself working harder than I do when I run.  Her energy though keeps me going.

5528808,3,B00AZ2N906,"In full transparency, I bought this DVD AFTER many of Jess's other walking DVDs. Had this been my first exposure to Jess and her walking routines, I likely would have more glowing reviews. But since I purchased this after her 21, 30 and 6 week programs, I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed with these workouts. They are VERY repetitive and a bit to basic for me personally. Someone new to Jessica's walking workouts or new to fitness in general would probably better suited for this DVD. I purchased it for two reasons (1) to support Jessica because she is the absolute best trainer I have ever worked out with and (2) because I wanted to do the ""ultimate weight loss collection"" 4 disc rotation. I'm not disappointed in my purchase at all, rather I will use this DVD on days when I want to workout but am looking for something on the lighter side.",1456876800,28,851,4.426751592356688

5528812,5,B00AZ2N906,"I've become a huge fan of walking workouts, after years of pounding my body with high impact aerobics.  My joints have finally said, ""Enough!""  I started using Leslie Sansone Walking workouts and while they have a place in my routine, I just love Jessica's walking workouts.  Jessica is a master at mixing walking moves up so that I am never bored.

Jessica and mother daughter team of Andrea and Asha are working out pool side.  I feel better just looking at the pretty set.  Andrea is doing an easier version of the moves while Asha is doing a more difficult version.  I love watching Asha with her energy and enthusiasm.

This DVD has the following sections:

* Walking Warm Up (5 minutes) - I really need this since I workout very early in the morning.

* High Energy Walk (30 minutes) - The Latin background music really adds to the energetic feel of this workout.  Some of the moves in this routine include:  spicy Latin walk (you move your hips side to side), the change your mind walk (you go forward, hesitate and then move backward), cowgirl lasso arms while turning around and step tap clap.  Even the names of the moves are fun!  Jessica does a great job at breaking down the moves so they are quite easy to pick up, even if you have two left feet.

* Power Walk (30 minutes) - You do a steady state section, interspersed with a higher intensity move.  The moves can be made more intense by doing light jogging instead of walking.  Each section is repeated two times.  Some of the moves in this routine include:  elliptical arms while walking, V arms up and down, jumping jack arms with butt kick.

* Cool Down and Stretch (5 minutes) - I'll admit it, I tend to skip cool downs and stretch since I always seem to be running short on time.  I know they are good for me and will help prevent stiffness, but I still struggle with doing them.  Jessica's cool downs are so much fun that I don't mind doing them.

You can play all sections or pick an individual section to play.

I love this DVD because you can make it as easy or as difficult as you want.  I can use it on those days when I'm feeling really energetic and I can use it on those days when I don't feel like pushing that hard.",1424044800,5,2197,4.325980392156863

Her workouts are simple, but not boring, and the time flies.  There are 2 workouts on this dvd, with a mother and daughter helping to demonstrate the moves with Jessica.  The second workout is more challenging as it contains several ""bursts"" of energy (less than 30 seconds).  The exerciser has the option to follow the high- middle- or low-intensity version.  Jessica has brightened up my dreary, winter walks when it was too cold to walk outside.  I highly recommend this dvd, along with the Walk On series.",1420761600,2,674,4.7094017094017095
5528815,5,B00AZ2N906,"I decided to try Jessica Smiths DVDs after using exercising with Leslie Sansone for several years.  I am in my early 60s and fit.  However, I require low-impact lower body moves due to knee issues.  Jessica is cheerful and positive without being irritating.  Seeing her beautiful smile and brightly colored tops while I exercise is uplifting.  Her instructions are clear, her moves are crisp and the timing is accurate, with rare exceptions.  I began with Jessicas Walk On: Dance Walk and Latin Dance Walk DVD, and graduated to the Walking for Weight Loss, Wellness & Energy DVD.  I find these two walks more challenging than the Dance Walk and Latin Dance Walk routines, but equally enjoyable. I enjoy both of these routines and I only have to modify a couple of moves due to my knee issues.  I also like the fact that this DVD contains separate warm up and cool down segments with two 30-min aerobic segments.",1419033600,3,911,4.7215189873417724

5528821,4,B00AZ2N906,"Great video.  I like her cues and music.  Good workout.  I only have one issue and gave only 4 stars as I cannot figure out how she ends up on the foot she does when turning on some moves.  This is a little thing, but is driving me crazy as I always end up on the wrong foot when she turns left or right and then back to the front.  This will not stop me from buying her other videos.  I like her much more than Debra Mazda who is great at motivation, but cannot count or cue correctly.  And Leslie's walk videos have too much chatter for me even though I tell myself she is just trying to be helpful I just cannot listen to them frequently.  So the best part is this video is motivating without being annoying, and gives a great workout with options, and she can count and cue.

I usually do more intense workouts, but I like to mix some lower impact in as well. A mother/daughter team joins her which i thought was a bit of an interesting choice. The mom does low impact and her movements to me were a bit bizaare. Her arms were flaying around in unusual ways, but i guess it goes to show everyone has their own style of working out.
I did both routines back to back. In both workouts, she has you work the front part of your leg (shin area) by bending down into almost a squat and tapping your toes back and forth. Now Im not blaming the dvd for this, but the next day--for a week, my one knee has been in a lot of pain, causing me to limp.

5528837,5,B00AZ2N906,"Jessica Smith gives you excellent cues, isn't over done in the perk department, and keeps a decent pace for me in this DVD. Some exercise background, so you know where I'm coming from: I was working out to the 30 Day Shred last year, and was doing some kettle bell work as well, when somehow my left hip ball joint developed spurs on the bone, making it excruciatingly painful to walk, let alone do mountain climbers or other higher impact moves. So I've been sitting around my butt (more or less) except for some toning & stretching DVDs by Karen Voight. I also highly recommend her DVDs.

For my current level of fitness, I was able to do the first of the walking routines and I found it yes, a bit challenging. The moves Jessica shows you are not complicated, but if you're uncoordinated like I am from extended non-body use, it might take a repeat work out with the DVD to ""get it"".  The warm up is good, the surroundings are pleasant, and the camera focuses in on the other two exercisers enough so you can see what they're doing to modify the walk easier or harder. The only thing I miss from the DVD is Jessica's adorable French bull dog Peanut!  ;-D

In short, Jessica is a trainer I love to spend time with. She's VERY mindful of her audience's capabilities. This shows up on her website and YouTube channel, as well. If you have any mobility problems, she has a YouTube video (FREE!) that covers it. If not, she responds to suggestions and sooner or later, the workout you need will be up!

The second 30 minute workout involves Interval bursts throughout the workout to push your heart rate higher.

Jessica's unique and charming personality shine through.

No clips of Peanut, her funny dog she has on her YouTube videos.  It is done outside in the sand on round discs for Jennifer who does Intermediate and her modifiers for Beginners and one more for Advanced.

Something to make you feel like you got up and moving!",1375142400,3,591,4.547169811320755
5528842,5,B00AZ2N906,I am so glad I purchased this dvd.  It has helped me immensely.  I have several Leslie Samsone dvd's but wanted to try something different.  I am loving this.  I am 50 with and have shoulder issues.  I am careful when performing the many arm movements but they actually seem to be helping my pain and limitations.  The dvd is a lot of fun and I am very happy with my purchase,1372464000,3,375,4.138888888888889
5528843,4,B00AZ2N906,"I really like this instructor! She is very pleasant and makes this workout fun even though the moves are somewhat repetitive. I LOVE fitness DVD's that give two or more levels to perform the workout. I bumped this workout up a bit by adding my weighted vest and some light 2lb. weights all while making sure to stay in proper form. I broke a light sweat. MY fat burn zone is between 125-160. In Zumba class I get up to about 135-165. This workout got me to about 127-133. So it is definitely a light workout but it gets your heart rate going and there is no dread factor. I burned 226 calories wearing my vest and using the 2lb. weights while doing the first segment. I will do the second segment tomorrow, its probably a bit harder since it is interval based, but probably still very doable for a lower impact day. I will use the DVD mostly for my early morning workout when I don't want to do a whole lot of jumping around. I walk my dog for about 15 mins in the morning so I will add this on top of that and save the harder workouts for later in the day as I did today!",1371859200,2,1072,4.109523809523809
5528844,5,B00AZ2N906,"An easy-to-follow fat-burner that includes lots of marches and taps , step-touches and mambos  , reverse V-steps and power jacks (always with low-impact choices).  The DVD has two segments. The first is  easier , the second has longer range-of-motion and higher-impact exercises. Jessica's friendly attitude, great cuing and soundtrack make this a workout you'll want to do often.",1371427200,4,380,5.517241379310345
5528845,4,B00AZ2N906,"Usually will do Leslie Sansone's Walking routines, but this one is a nice change of pace.  A little more structured than Leslie's, but not so much that it's hard to keep up with what comes next.  I will use it in rotation with my other walking workout DVDS.",1371168000,,257,4.333333333333333
5528846,5,B00AZ2N906,"This is a great walking DVD. I've been lazy and slack  and really out of shape and I did the whole thing, and enjoyed it. She looks like she's enjoying it, the outside setting is so nice after so many indoor sets. Fun and simple moves. She never let up and neither did I, and I felt like I had had a  good  fast-walk.  Highly recommended!",1371081600,3,338,4.075757575757576
5528847,3,B00AZ2N906,"I felt there could have been more variation in this walking DVD.  I would have to say that Chris Freytag puts out better walking dvds along with The Biggest Loser.  For Beginners, you can't beat Leslie Sansone.  I have tried other DVDs by Jessica and will continue to try them, but no longer purchase any of her walking DVDs.",1368316800,4,325,4.47457627118644
5528848,4,B00AZ2N906,"I have never used Jessica Smith DVD's before and had used Lesley Sansone Walking DVD's, the last being her 5 mile. I was tiring of the sameness and even with belts, etc. felt she didn't push too hard or give alternatives. It was great for beginners or if you needed a light day, but sometimes I wanted to sweat.
The first half of this DVD, I admit, I found myself saying, ""This is a bit boring"" The energy walk was less exciting then Lesley Sansone's especially staying in ""the circle"" but you can move more. I like that she appreciates small living conditions, but it's limiting. That said, boy the second part was not boring at all! I looked like I used to at the gym, sweating and red faced, but in a good way. I followed Alicia (?) who did the more advanced and although I had to push myself, it felt great. I think I will do the 30 minutes Power Walk, on days I want to do less and have less time and skip the earlier Energy Walk.

She was good at letting you do what you can and her enthusiasm was motivating. Overall I'm glad I bought it and will use it with other exercise DVD's on ""inside"" days.",1367884800,5,1104,4.183098591549296
5528849,5,B00AZ2N906,"This is a great alternative to using the treadmill or elliptical, plus helps with working on the back, shoulders and arms while walking.  Cuing is easy to follow and well done.  Can do either or both workouts, depending on my mood, and don't need any weights.",1367366400,,259,4.608695652173913

5528851,5,B00AZ2N906,"This is a great workout DVD.  It has a warm-up and cool down and 2 30 minute workouts that you can do individually or at the same time for a longer workout.  The moves are lo impact and easy, but not boring. One walk is a steady pace high energy walk,and the other is a power walk with intervals.",1364860800,2,296,4.0
5528852,5,B00AZ2N906,"I don't generally like waking workouts.  I like more variety in my cardio than most of them provide. Enter Jessica Smith's Walking for Weight Loss, Wellness, and Energy. It is my favorite walking workout ever.

First of all, the warm up is great. The Cool Down Stretch is also very thorough. I love how they are separate chapters so I can use them before or after other workouts too.

As for the walks themselves, I love the mother/daughter duo in them. They provide great modifications to take the intensity up or down a notch as needed.  I also love the variety of moves in here. The workout even has a slightly dancey feel to it, which I love.

You can't beat the outdoor setting. Or, the great instruction and encouragement from Jessica Smith, who is a fantastic instructor.

If you've tried walking workouts in the past and found them boring, give this one a try. I really think you'll enjoy it.",1363478400,5,900,4.559006211180124

5528856,5,B00AZ2N906,"I was pleasantly surprised to discover this new walking workout by Jessica Smith.  It contains 2 different 30 minute walking workouts, plus a 5 minute warm up and a 6 minute cool down.  The walking is energetic and fun, with a variety of moves.  The High Energy Walking workout has lots of different steps and peppy music.  The Power Walking workout is designed more like intervals with one move demonstrated and then sped up.  Both walks have a lot of arm movements to go with the feet to keep your heart rate up.  With each workout, Jessica has 2 walkers behind her--one demonstrates an even lower impact version and the other a higher impact version.  The set is outdoors and bright with white furniture and trees.  Jessica is perfectly friendly and energetic without being annoying.  This is a fresh new workout for those that like low impact walking for exercise.  It's a bit more energetic and intense than some of Leslie Sansone's DVDs and it seems like a better workout than Leslie's 2 mile walks because it's 30 solid minutes of walking at a fast pace, with a separate warm up and cool down that are each 4-5 minutes.",1362096000,21,1126,4.613065326633166
5528857,5,B00AZ2N906,"This is my second day trying Jessica's two new DVDs (see my Amazon review of her new ""Total Body Balance"").

As with Jessica's other DVDs.  This DVD features Jessica, very cheerful, energetic and positive.  She performs the intermediate level options during high impact moves, and also provides both a high and low impact walker for all levels in between.

This DVD is broken down into a 5 minute warm up, 30 minute moderate intensity walk, a 30 minute higher intensity interval walk and is followed by a refreshing 5 minute cool down segment.

We have the pleasure of enjoying a beautiful white sand zen garden, complete with tropical palms and other plants, sunshine, and a beautiful Grecian-style architectural backdrop.

The music is appropriately chosen to match the intensity and style of each portion of the walking workout.

I am a long time fan of Jessica's teaching style, and DVD series, and haven't missed a single workout either through her DVD series, clear back to her first DVD for Women's Health, up to her free YouTube Series (JessicaSmithTV, which she regularly posts free, full length workouts, with candid, cute moments with her adorable pup ""Peanut"".  Jessica is dedicated to reaching out, and helping everyone, despite limitation or disability and does so with a smile and infectious positive attitude.

This DVD is perfect for ANY collection, be one an avid, routine exerciser such as myself (I typically do high impact workouts such as Turbofire, Insanity etc), or someone who is new to fitness, or is just looking for something a little lighter or different to try.

I own one walking DVD aside from this DVD.  From past experience, walking workouts have seemed a good option for a rest day.  That is where I started with this working, thinking, ah, I worked hard yesterday, today I will do something a little lighter.  This DVD pleasantly surprised me.  I burned a whopping 630 calories doing the entire DVD straight through (I weigh under 150 lbs) performing a combination of both higher and moderate intensity options.  That being said, I highly recommend this DVD, along with anything else Jessica Smith has produced.",1361750400,36,2147,4.974789915966387
5528858,5,B00AZ2N906,"These walking routines are more challenging than other walking workout DVDs that I own. Jessica offers 3 different levels on many of the moves, which allows you to adjust the workout to your current level. There are no problems doing any of the moves in a small  indoor space. If you are an advanced exerciser, these routines are great for a lighter cardio day. I love the outdoor setting and the music is great! Jessica Smith is an awesome instructor and I love all of her workouts!",1361664000,6,483,4.551724137931035
5528859,5,B00AZ2N906,I can't say enough a out this workout I was so excited when this arrived to me today. I have been working out with Jessica's workouts for about 3-4 weeks now and she has been the only one to keep me motivated enough to keep working out. I like how she always seems to remind us not to worry if we don't look coordinated we are in the comforts of home and just getting that workout in. This workout was awesome and at first I thought I would only be able to do one 30 min session but I felt really good and did the complete workout. Jessica as always you have come through to provide an awesome workout.,1361491200,4,602,4.067226890756302

Lots of simple moves and beautiful scenery with my favorite instructor.
Jessica uses the upper body in unique ways to increase the intensity besides offering 3 different intensity levels.
Each move and combination are repeated enough to get into each but not overdone.
Rebounder friendly because Jessica uses very little space.

I believe that you get out of a workout what you put into it, but for some people this one may still be too easy for them. The moves aren't difficult to do and these aren't sweat dripping, intense workouts, but they are still effective at getting your heart rate up.
