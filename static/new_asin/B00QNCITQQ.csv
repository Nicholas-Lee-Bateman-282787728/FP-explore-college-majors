8692190,4,B00QNCITQQ,"I bought this series thinking- especially from previous reviews I read - that it would give me a good insight into the life and struggles of the Polish people during the occupation of their country and the destruction of so much of its cultural heritage and of so many of its people by the Germans between 1939 and 1945.
I have only watched most of the first two series so far, nearly called it quits after Series 1, but it seems more like a lesson in who not to send back into a country in order to assist the eventual defeat of the invaders and brutal occupiers.
I know the background story has to be set and characters developed but our band of heroes seem far more concerned with their private family matters and love lives than with harassing the Germans. Apart from that I find the English subtitles a bit hard to get used to in that they quite often appear ahead of the scene in which the dialogue takes place. That is to say the subtitles for the next scene are on the screen before one scene closes and the next scene opens - quite distracting but I am getting used to it. That and the use of such modern colloquialisms as 'snitch' to denote someone who is either in the pay of the Gestapo or has provided information to them.
Apart from that there are quite a few holes in the story -- such as how his rescuers could come into very close contact with a typhus sufferer without contracting this highly contagious and deadly disease themselves. And what sort of agent, given the instruction to carry out a death sentence on a known Gestapo agent and with a very clear headshot available to him from perhaps 3 metres distance throws down his weapon when confronted by a target not quite so ready to die.????
But I am not Polish - just very interested in this aspect of history. I was not there so maybe the series is more true to life than I think it is. But the ghetto scenes seem to be a bit whitewashed since there was no reason why our family of partly Jewish Catholics should have a multi-room apartment to themselves when the general populace of the Warsaw ghetto was crowded as many as 14 persons to a single room. As I understand it the ghetto - of which almost nothing exists today - was just a few small suburban blocks of apartment houses into which more than 400,000 people were crammed.
But I will continue watching this series - especially since it cost-a-lotsa to import it to Australia - and get back to you if I think it warrants it.

WELL THERE YOU GO !!!!!
Patience is a virtue.!!!!!!!!!!
As one reviewer has put it this series is at least on a par with anything the BBC has ut out in recent years no matter what the subject matter.

I have watched nearly all of the first two series - up to Episode 19 and I must say that this series is becoming all that I hoped it would be - an insight into the life and times of the people of Warsaw under the occupation and how they struggled against it. .

Importantly for me the SUBTITLES HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED and they are now displayed in co-ordination with the dialogue.

Apart from that there are fewer gaps and implausibles in the story - though I really cannot understand why just about everybody who is anybody in the character list has to dine at the same restaurant. Surely there must have been more than one such place in Warsaw where they could meet and plot and plan.

Again I will get back to you as the story unfolds -- a great series and well worth the money I spent on importing it -- but a pity about the first few episodes where as I wrote Our Heroes seemed determined to break every rule in the book about maintaining cover and secrecy.",1497052800,,3621,4.319117647058824
