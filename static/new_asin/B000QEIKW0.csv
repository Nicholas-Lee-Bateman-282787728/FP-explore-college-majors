8195976,5,B000QEIKW0,I had this on VHS after it was released and was glad to find it on DVD. Its a valid record of the response to punk my a lot of people . Every body had their own view of punks message and most people were looking for something new as we were all sick of the main stream music on radio and television. Punk was an inspiration to a new generation with a flood of new sounds to pass the time. Its great to see The Dead Boys X-Ray Specs and the other bands. The sound track is great and worth the price just for that reason. Amazon had this Listed under movies and not under music. I hope they will fix that so others will find it quicker. Buy it if you are a fan or just wonder what the big fuss was about .,1377734400,,703,3.8219178082191783
