3912435,3,B002DQL364,"Considering this had a low-budget of just $2m ($3m if you add the marketing) it's a remarkably cohesive and fun film. Certainly the best indie SF B-movie I've seen since Immortal - and I daresay people will have similarly mixed reactions to it.  These days we're all dazzled by the gloss and audience-measured plotlines of $50m epics, I suspect, and so we gripe when we see some indie grit. But if you can get past that, there's a decent entertainment to be had here. Overall the film feels rather like a long episode of Firefly, only with a 'reveal' that the Reavers were just bluffing and are actually the long-time immortal overlords of humanity rather than space brigands. But Humanity's End sprinkles that Firefly mix with the humanised-robots from Battlestar Galactica, and a few small touches of Star Wars (not much, just a Han Solo-alike, and some Scout Walker-alikes). The introduction to the film, narrating the history of humanity for seven minutes, has a rather poor choice of stock images and an annoying narrator - I would have thought any budding fantasy artist would have been happy to apply their skills here at little cost.  But after the introduction, there's a lot to like.  Except in a few explosions and laser-fire, the world of the film looks believable. The plot is a little stretched at times, especially towards the end, and I would have thought a little more SF inventiveness could have added a few subtle twists and thus avoided some illogicality. And the films threatens to bog down a little in the middle with an appropriately SF love-triangle, but the acting manages to keep it afloat.  The acting throughout is convincing, and I can't understand other reviews that moan that the acting is very poor. So, some of the baddies are hamming it up - but it comes with the territory. The dialogue might have been snappier, but the writers seem to have taken useful tips from Joss Whedon, and they're obviously trying their best. My test of a solid SF B-movie is - would I watch it again. I'd watch Humanity's End again, and happily.  I'm not sure I'd watch it a third time, though.",1251676800,20,2106,4.727520435967302
3912436,3,B002DQL364,"They overdid the intro.  The story wants to be complex but in reality its a simple story.

It's a hack and combination of Star Wars, Macross, and other sci-fi movies.

A lot of action here.  Space battles with decent SPX.  Definitely worth a watch.  But keep in mind - it accomplishes its mission to be a good B movie.

Just don't expect a Star Wars.",1279756800,4,350,4.292307692307692

The plot is horrible, the acting is terrible ,the whole story arc makes no sense. You don't even care about the characters.

3912438,3,B002DQL364,"In the future humans will become extinct and hybrid races will begin to take over the universe. The year is 2820: An ancient race of aliens, known as the Nephilim, have systematically hunted down and destroyed every human in the galaxy. A semi-retired starship captain, Derasi Vorde, returns from the outer rim to find he is the last man alive. Together with his hapless crew, and his old beaten starship, The Blue Whale, Derasi is entrusted with caring for a young woman, who holds the key to repopulating the human race. As the entire Nephilim warfleet chases the Blue Whale across the galaxy, Derasi learns that he must become the one thing he despises; a great leader, and the savior to all mankind. The true love of his life, The Blue Whale, holds a dark secret, and Derasi discovers that many close to him cannot be trusted.

Overall, this movie was ok for an indie film. Even though the technology seems to be lacking a bit, it is still worth checking out. I would definitely rent it from Netflix and Redbox. The music is pretty cool which I really liked.

3912439,4,B002DQL364,"Either this movie was intentionally cast, directed and filmed to be campy perfection, or it's one of the most amazing coincidences ever.
Each role was perfectly acted, being either over or under-played. The FX were so inconsistent and the melodramatic musical score was spot on! It was so bad it was good!!!
They took something from every space opera, space western, space drama and space comedy ever written and combined it into the most ridiculous, outrageously schlocky 50's style B movie I could imagine. I found myself laughing out loud at the stereotypical characters and the bizarre plot line developments, even when main characters died. There was no sympathy for them, because they were TRYING to be annoying and obnoxious. But I DO admire the folks who put this together....... I believe they did all of this on purpose and it turned out precisely as they intended!!! It's unhinged brilliance at it's finest. I just don't think most folks recognized it as a spoof of itself!!
The only way this movie could be improved upon is for the MST3K crew to screen it from the SOL!!!!!",1258502400,8,1085,4.838709677419355
3912440,4,B002DQL364,"We've become a cynical viewing public, disuading all but the studio blockbusters from even attempting special effects films. I found this feature to be insightful and enlightening. The struggle for the truth of human existence and particularly a (rare) focus on women's issues makes this production a standout. Examining the mother/nurturer vs. conquering warrior themes in women is a refreshing departure from the typical sci-fi plot structure, and I appreciate the spotlight on women for a change!  Jay Laisne was a perfect tragic hero. Again, focus was placed not just on the sexy savy hero flirting with disaster, but also on deeper layers of ambition and man's sense of identity and purpose.
  The music was absolutely gorgeous and created a frame for the narrative.  And the lighting and effects were enough for this viewer to suspend disbelief.  I think it is sad that viewers have become so jaded that special effects comparisons even have to be made.  Remember the very first Star Trek shows? I accepted every bit of it.  And, compared to today's technology, one could easily criticize those special effects too.
  At the end of the day, it's the story.  And this one is thought provoking and provocative.  I'd recommend it!",1254441600,20,1233,5.024630541871921

3912442,2,B002DQL364,"Have you ever watched a movie and said to yourself ""This is like a Frankenstein's monster of a film""? What I mean by that is you're watching the movie and it is painfully obvious that all the writer or director or whoever did was take different parts of other movies and put them in his own. That's basically what you get with Humanity's End.

The movie was actually a lot more intelligent than your run of the mill SyFy Channel Saturday Night fodder. It had a story that at least attempted to be a bit more original than everything else out there, but it's handicap of basing elements on other films really does affect it in the end. The lead character is basically a caricature of Han Solo. He's got the swagger, the sarcasm, the blatant disregard of the ""rules"", and any other personality traits you can think of the captain of the Millennium Falcon having. The bad guys look like cheap versions of the Borg from Star Trek - literally to the T.

The special effects have this weird kind of Chronicles of Riddick meets Mutant Chronicles meets Sin City CGI thing going on. It actually kind of looks cool and not as goofy as a lot of straight-to-DVD effects. The scenery is definitely pretty clean. Even the insides of the ships don't look like they were shot in a rented storage unit that they just kept moving the props around in to make it look like a different set.

The beginning voiceover and synopsis of what has happened up until the movie starts is a bit long-winded and annoying, but I really did have to give them props for trying to make this film epic and, like I said before, not just some straight-up copycat sci-fi drivel. Even the music was more sophisticated. It was actually symphonic and emotional versus the typical techno or beat driven synth soundtrack you get accompanying these types of films.

I can't really recall every movie this brought to mind as I watched it, but I can tell you that if you do see it, you to will get that feeling of deja vu. Humanity's End is an entertaining, humorous, and somewhat serious attempt at doing something original in the science fiction genre. If you need a sci-fi fix on a Saturday night, you might want to hunt this down at your local Blockbuster (if the one by you wasn't one of the 1,000 recently shut down).",1253664000,4,2275,4.48792270531401

3912444,1,B002DQL364,"I rented this movie to watch with my 14 year old son. The begining intro drags on and on and on and on. The acting is bad to worst than an elementary school drama play.

8365871,4,B002DQL364,"""Humanity's End"" is a mix of good and bad.  And in the end, the good parts of the film outweigh the bad.  If one focuses on the hero, then the movie is a terrible waste.  But if one focuses on the female characters, then the movie takes on a completely different tone.

The Good:
* Special effects, most of them very colorful and appropriate.
* The music is moving and powerful
* The introduction of the movie retells human history, and the ending wraps the story up in a similarly ambitious way.

The Bad:
* A few of the effects are overdone and some are inappropriate.  For example, gigantic explosions are scaled-down and placed into a firefight.
* The same music is repeatedly used and begins to lose its impact.
* The story is essentially that of Battlestar Galactica (old or new series), so it is not original.
* Many of the scenes involve sophmoric dialogue and humor that are uncomfortable to watch.

The Interesting:
* The hero is immature, crude, and has no redeeming qualities.  Every other character has more charm than he does.  And this is what makes the movie different; he is intentionally scripted as an unsympatheic, immature character.
* The hero is analogous to the Christ of the Christian New Testament.
* The female characters are the actual heroines of the story.  They should be seen as the characters who actually move the story along.

If you have read this far, then you may be patient enough to watch this movie and ignore the hero.",1313193600,7,1460,4.598455598455598
8365872,3,B002DQL364,"When a distant race called the Nephilim makes it their task to erase humanity from the face of the galaxy, it's up to one man and one woman on a remote planet to avoid death and give humankind a fresh start.  The task isn't easy with the ultraviolent Nephilim and another hybrid race known as the Konstrukts bent on destroying them.

Overall, I enjoyed this film.  The emotional tone was a little too ""campy"" for me personally, which took away from the (potential) drama of the film.  The special effects were well done, and the cinematography was well-done as well. Editing was sharp. The actors did a fine job.  The story was interesting as well.  As another reviewer has noted, the film does deal with the primal themes of survival, and lost love amid the action scenes.

sci-fi fans should enjoy this..",1295481600,4,806,4.633802816901408
8365873,5,B002DQL364,"I grew up in the late 70's, early 80's when Star Wars came out when everybody wanted more movies like that and for a while there was none around. Many of us still remember those B-Movies (and some times Z-Movies) productions that everybody all around the world was trying to create to jump on the success of George Lucas. It was the time of ""Galaxina"", ""Battle Beyond the Stars"", ""The Humanoid"", ""Starchaser"" and the brilliant ""Starcrash"" among many other obscure stuff. It was a time where there wasn't yet a new special effects movie opening every weekend and so people were going to all these alternatives trying to get more of the same atmosphere seen in Star Wars.

Now, i just discovered this ""Humanity's End"" the other day, and i thought i was in for a really, really bad catastrophe movie. The trailer seemed to have something appealing, but at the same time it made the movie look like much worse that actually is. In fact, the only thing real bad on ""Humanity's End"" it's the tittle !! What a lousy name for such a great little space adventure ! Someone should rename this movie and release it again, because despite being an independent production with lots of flaws and an obvious lack of budget it manages to be one of the most fun and pure Space-Operas out there in the best Doc Smith 30's classic style made with modern a look.

It feels like an imaginative clone of Serenity with all the good fun in place mixed with something like the adventures of Han Solo's red-neck lost cousin with a touch of forbidden archeology themes mixed in it (Zacharia Sitchin/Richard Hoagland/Coast to Coast Radio)and the fact is that everything works perfectly.

""Humanity's End"" has a strange feel to it. Lots of ""independent"" CGI effects that feel like ""video-game-plastic"" all time but have an excellent graphic style and create a fantastic unique atmosphere through out the story, characters that are as much annoying as they are fun, lots of humor, surprising good and believable drama and a good share of little action scenes which are not very epic to look at but are always a joy to follow. The story is much more imaginative than i would ever expect it to be and i believe that if the movie had at least one hour more to properly develop everything ""Humanity's End"" could have been as good as the best in Firefly.

In 90 minutes everything seems rushed and the adventure ends extremely fast in an anti-climax that leaves the viewer wanting more. The bad guys have that GOD-like power, wiped out mankind but they're totally destroyed in such a simple way that it disappoints. Come on people... This is where the lack of budget in this movie was more evident. No money to create the epic space-opera battle people are expecting and that the story seems to spend all the movie setting up. But...that's OK.

It's OK, because surprisingly the characters are fun to watch, the dialogues are sometimes hilarious but in the next moment achieve some good little emotional moments and i was surprised to reach the end of this movie caring for those persons (even for the ship's computer). Nobody will ever win an Oscar for their acting here, but we can see the players really are having lots of fun with their characters, particularly ""Han Solo's red-neck cousin"" which is the lead hero.

Too bad this was such a small movie and i would love to see more movies with these characters. Maybe George Lucas will sponsor a new movie as he and Rick McCallun get thanked by the creators of this movie in the end credits. I'm not saying that ""Humanity's End"" does not have all the flaws that other people who didn't liked the movie mention on their reviews. In my opinion they are not important if you are in a mood to see an old-school space-opera done with imagination. Just leave your brain outside and enjoy ""Humanity's End"" for what it is. A great little B-Movie space-opera with tons of flaws but lots of personality and a memorable anti-hero.

Probably the best (""bad-movie"") space-opera i've seen since my all time favorite, the 1979 Italian star-wars clone, ""Starcrash"". In my opinion ""Humanity's End"" deserves the maximum stars, for fun, atmosphere, being a pure space-opera with tons of personality (cool sets) and for the courageous twist at the end.

If you love Firefly, check this one out and you might be surprised.
Ignore the bad trailer and the bad hype.",1288396800,12,4360,4.697643979057592
8365874,1,B002DQL364,"Humanity's End is literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It has a nearly incomprehensible plot, what little there is of it, about a future where there are constructs, neanderthals, nephilim, and biobots, robots, and regular humans.  There is some war or something, and some groups fighting other groups.  The story seems to revolve around a ship called the Blue Whale, or something like that, which looks a lot like a WW2 German Uboat on steroids.

There are space ships, gun fights, bombs, and explosions, all done is very poor special effects and with almost no meaning at all to what is happening.  There also is a sperm carrying teddy bear.  I kid you not.

The acting is very bad, but the script is worse.  The extremely long and boring intro to the movie goes through some ""lost history"" of humanity.  It is so convoluted and bizarre that it is not easily followed.

The characters are uneven and some suddenly change attitudes and styles right in the middle of the movie, without any explanation??!??  Truly poorly done.

I would give the movie zero stars, but that was not an option.

The only positive thing I can say about Humanity's End is that some of the background music was nice.",1287964800,,1208,4.6415094339622645
