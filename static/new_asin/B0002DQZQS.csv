8026770,5,B0002DQZQS,"Yea, this is the Day, hey.
A loverly, wonderful video to make the heart glad.
Some wonderful images like the mountain goat tapping his brother (on the side of a mountain) with his hoof.
The birds with their ministering songs.
Beautiful and encouraging.
If there is nothing to be thankful for, for whatever reason, at least this video centres reality and hope rebuking hopelessness, empowering truth and a clear, overcoming future.
this is true for every reason in watching this video, for fun or for insight.
Thank you.",1304812800,,519,4.909090909090909

8026772,5,B0002DQZQS,I have loved this video for the past 15 years.  A friend gave me a copy when we were both struggling to survive depression.  The excellent photography of breathtaking nature scenes and the Scripture with music accompaniment can soothe a troubled and weary soul in a matter of minutes. This is the third copy I have owned.  The other two disappeared!,1287446400,2,349,4.688524590163935
