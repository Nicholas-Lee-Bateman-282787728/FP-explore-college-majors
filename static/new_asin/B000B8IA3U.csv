2408489,5,B000B8IA3U,I am totally loving this dvd set and can't wait until the other seasons are released. This is clean and wholesome fun for all. Quite inventive stories and with the trash currently on tv this is quite a refreshing show to watch,1144627200,7,226,4.404761904761905
2408490,4,B000B8IA3U,Finally One Of My Favorite Shows From The 1970's Comes To DVD. Fantasy Island Where Mr. Rourke And Tattoo Make Your Every Fantasy Come True. Can't Wait For Season 2 To Come To DVD,1142035200,9,179,4.294117647058823
2408491,5,B000B8IA3U,"One of my favorite shows of the late 70's was Fantasy Island. Coupled with Love Boat, this was a one-two punch for ABC in its heyday of the 1980's.

From The waterfall seen during the opening sequences which is the real-life Wailua Falls in Kauai, Hawaii to Mr Roarke's sly ""Welcome to Fantasy Island"" as he lifts his glass to toast this guests, this show was class.

The DVD of the first season which includes the two pilot movies is wonderful. It barely dates itself and is still a lot of fun to watch. This 13 hour collection has sixteen great episodes. The DVD extras include the end caps (Next week on Fantasy Island) and two short features. The only thing that is  missing a Ricardo Montalban audio commentary

on an episode or two

I can wish Love Boat (with its 3 pilots), Vegas (with Robert Urich) and Matt Houston appear on DVD soon",1135555200,49,842,4.441558441558442
2408492,5,B000B8IA3U,"This is a great TV DVD collection.  The shows are fun to watch, with their fun, but often silly, adventures.  With some of the 70's fashion, the show offers a lot to laugh at, err, feel nostalgic about.  While the series isn't exactly the most high quality drama in the world, it is based on an extremely creative concept.  The never ending line of great guest stars and the breathtaking scenery add great elements for the viewers enjoyment.

At the center of the show is the host, Mr. Rourke, played to perfection by Ricardo Monteblan.  He does so well, it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  He represents a consistent anchor each episode of the series, which otherwise varies dramatically from week to week, depending on the various guest stars and their fantasies.

The typical episode goes something like this:

1) A few guests arrive with unique fantasies.

2) Mr. Rourke delivers a fantasies of sorts.

3) The fantasies aren't exactly as requested.

4) However, the fantasy Mr. Rourke gives each of them turns out to be exactly what they REALLY needed.

5) Everyone leaves the island as a satisfied customer.

Although the formula is very consistent each week, the variety of the guest stars and the uniqueness of each fantasy make this a very entertaining show.  Also, the beginning of each episode starts you wondering as to how Mr. Rourke will fulfill each fantasy with his own special twist.  This was one of the better sitcoms of the 70s.

While there are a couple of special features included, this package doesn't have an overwhelming supply of special features that some packages have.  Nonetheless, this is a DVD collection that is worth owning.",1133481600,44,1675,4.817543859649123
2408493,4,B000B8IA3U,i watched fantasy island years ago. i did like the show. but seasons on. it was the same tv star with a different character. thats were the show fails. i read the seasons of fantasy island and there is at least 3 or 4 actors. that come back. playing someone else. i rather had sony come out with the flying nun or i dream of jeannie instead.,1129248000,2,341,4.104477611940299
2408494,5,B000B8IA3U,"I've been waiting for this for ages.  ""Fantasy Island"" is my all-time favorite TV show; I lived for Saturday nights and really got into the stories every week.  In fact I used to fantasize myself about having a role on this show! :)  I had an enormous wish list for the DVD: all episodes UNCUT; the ""next week on..."" promos; interviews; behind-the-scenes material...  It looks as if all my wishes are actually coming true.  (Well, it IS Fantasy Island!)  I have November 15 marked on my calendar and I will be in sheer bliss that day, watching the episodes and all those tantalizing extras that are coming along with it.  Thanks zillions, Sony, for at last bringing this wonderful, magical show out on DVD!",1129075200,7,706,4.645161290322581
2408495,5,B000B8IA3U,I cannot wait for this to come out.  I remember as a kid waiting up until all hours of the evening to watch reruns in the summertime.  This is definitely worth purchasing.,1128902400,3,171,4.3125
2408496,5,B000B8IA3U,"I'm so relieved to hear that Fantasy Island is being released on Nov 15th...will be getting this DVD.  I loved the pilot episode, tv movie and all the episodes of season one. Once I get this DVD..will be watching it.  Looking forward getting all of Fantasy Island Seasons on DVD...Sony, please release season two and others real soon. Fantasy Island is one of my favorite television shows in the 70's decade - very entertaining show to watch each guest stars getting their fantasies on fantasy island.",1128902400,2,501,4.813953488372093
2408497,5,B000B8IA3U,"It's about time!  Finally, some of the fine work of Aaron Spelling is being released on DVD.  Charlie's Angels came out a few years ago to coincide with that dire movie, then we had a long dry spell until August '05, with the release of T.J. Hooker.  Hart to Hart is due out in October, then in November...Fantasy Island!  My picks for next Spelling shows on DVD: Matt Houston and Family.  Oh please, oh please!

Fantasy Island was a mid-season replacement, so its first season ('78-'79) only had 14 episodes and one two-hour TV movie, ""Return to Fantasy Island"" (the original TV Movie ""Fantasy Island"" aired in January '77).  The episodes in the first season are as follows:

ESCAPE / CINDERELLA GIRLS  Diana Canova, Bert Convy

BET A MILLION / MR. IRRESISTIBLE  Henry Gibson, John Schuck

THE PRINCE / THE SHERIFF  Ed Begley Jr., Lisa Hartman

FAMILY REUNION / VOODOO  Juliet Mills, John Gavin, Lauren Tewes, Howard Duff

LADY OF THE EVENING / THE RACER  Christopher George, Jerry VanDyke

TREASURE HUNT / BEAUTY CONTEST  Gene Barry, Louis Nye

THE FUNNY GIRL / BUTCH AND SUNDANCE  James MacArthur, Marcia Strassman, Christopher Connelly

SUPERSTAR / SALEM  Leslie Nielsen, Gary Burghoff, Vera Miles

TROUBLE, MY LOVELY / THE COMMON MAN  Don Knotts, Nancy Walker, Bernie Kopell

THE OVER THE HILL CAPER / POOF! YOU'RE A MOVIE STAR  Ray Bolger, Foster Brooks

REUNION / ANNIVERSARY  Michele Lee, Jim Backus, Lucie Arnaz

KING FOR A DAY / INSTANT FAMILY  David Doyle, Theodore Bikel, Adam Rich

FOOL FOR A CLIENT / DOUBLE YOUR PLEASURE  Ken Barry, Rich Little, Lana Wood

CALL ME LUCKY / TORCH SINGER  Richard Dawson, Dick Butkus, Edd ""Kookie"" Byrnes

Now, just look at that list of luminaries!  I mean, you won't come across Natalie Wood's sister Lana just anywhere.  Marcia ""Mrs. Kotter"" Strassman?  Gary ""Radar"" Burghoff?  Normally you'd have to watch at least a month's worth of Match Game to see all these stars.  But not with the advent of Fantasy Island on DVD.  Now all you have to do is pop in one of these discs and you'll soon see Herve Villechaize once again ascending the spiral staircase, ringing the bell, and calling out, ""De plane!  De plane!"" then scampering back to Mr. Roarke's side just in time to oversee Ken Barry being handed his fruity rum drink.

I tell ya, they just don't make 'em like this anymore.",1128038400,138,2327,4.738693467336684

2408512,5,B000B8IA3U,"You  don't  get  a  chance  to  see  shows  like  this  very  often  anymore  do  we?  I  love  the  show.  I'd  watch  it  back  in  the  80's  as  a  kid.
Its  a  place  where  your  fantasy  is  supposed  to  become  a  reality.  What  Mr  Roark  does  is  kind  of  give  them  a  mission  of  their  own,  &  that  helps  their  fantasy  prevail.  A  lot  of  good  actors  come  &  go  in  this  show,  I  do  recall  seeing  Bill Bixbey  from  (The  incredible hulk)  series,  in  either  the  first  or  second  season.  He  is  showing  a  little  age.  Or  was  that  just  makeup?
I  plan  to  buy  only  the  seasons  Tattoo  (Herve Villechaize)  was  in.  He  does  leave  the  show  at  some  point.  It  was  difficult  for  me  to  watch  the  show  after  he  left.  He  was  funny  in  the  show.  &  nobody  really  meant  to  hurt  Herve Villechaize's  feelings.  He  was  just  worried  that  he  couldn't  escape  being  made  fun  of.  I  heard  about  his  story  on  an  episode  of  (Unsolved Mysteries).  It  just  wasn't  the  same  after  he  left  this  show.  Wish  he'd  have  stayed  straight  through  to  the  last  season.
I  forget  what  season  it  was  that  he  left.
But  the  shows  a  lot  of  fun.  The  memories  will  live  on.  Great  acting,  great  scenery.  I  don't  see  how  anyone  who  use  to  watch  this  show  could  pass  watching  by  now.  Herve  was  part  of  the  reason  I  watched  the  show.  &  also  my  favorite  actor  on  fantasy  island!",1467244800,,1512,4.092

2408514,2,B000B8IA3U,"I used to own this season along with Seasons 2 and 3, so I was surprised to see that this is the only season on Amazon now.  According to someone on imdb, Sony bought back the rights from Shout Factory so I guess that accounts for the disappearance of additional seasons on dvd.

As for the show itself, I think it's a great idea that unfortunately got ruined with poor scripts and dreadful acting.  Mr. Roarke is the only believable character on any episode.  There was only one episode in Season One that I liked, which is ""Reunion,"" and I liked that because I like spooky shows that take place in old houses with thunderstorms.

This series could have been great if the idea had been handled better.  Unfortunately, most episodes just look like a bad soap opera.",1462665600,,765,4.507246376811594

And now, as an adult, I sit here watching reruns of our old favorite shows remembering fondly my childhood yet saddened at knowing that I will never again be able to watch this show with my brother who was taken at too young an age last year by a reckless driver.  So to this show and many others of yesteryear all I can say is thank you for being an anchor for me to a time when my whole family was together and happy.",1453248000,6,759,4.220689655172414

Mr. Roarke, Ricardo Montalbon, does ok with what he had to work with, but this is far inferior to the quality he usually put out. If you like nostalgia, you do get to see a lot of A and B level actors from the 70's as they guest star on there respective episodes.

2408605,5,B000B8IA3U,"When you step out of your seaplane onto the wooden dock at Fantasy Island, you are greeted by charming natives in colorful island garb; they offer you a tropical drink.  It is pleasantly warm, palm trees soar high overhead, a white gingerbread house overlooks the scene, your host awaits you at the end of the path; his name is Mr. Roarke . . . .

If you are Mr. Roarke, you have many secrets.  You maintain an aura of mystery about you, leaving others guessing: are you a magician; are you superhuman; did you truly know Alexander-the-Great?  Sometimes, just a simple word will do ... indeed.  You have even managed to mystify your little Cherubic attendant Tattoo . . . .

If you are Tattoo, you take care of many details for Mr. Roarke, most of them are financial; you express your displeasure when he grants a fantasy for free; he chides you for having a cash register for a heart.  Mr. Roarke is more than your boss; you are profound friends.  Occasionally a guest's fantasy will hit upon one of your favorite fantasies:  the pursuit of beautiful, single women . . . .

There was that time, when a guest - before committing to just one woman - wanted to see what it would be like to be irresistible to women.  At the end of his fantasy, you absconded with the little bottle of the magic cologne; alas, Mr. Roarke took it away from you.  And then, there was that Alaskan pipeline worker, his buddies paid for a fantasy they all shared: to spend a weekend with 2 beautiful women ... Wow!

Note: the Featurette, ""Creating the Fantasy"", is worth a look.  Insight into where ideas, for a great series, comes from.

2408610,4,B000B8IA3U,"I was excited to see Fantasy Island, and found that the quality of the dvd was good, considering the technology at the time the series was made.  I remember being enthralled by this series as a kid, and it is still a fun series to watch, although I can say that the period was decidedly more sexist than today, and the series is a product of its time.  I notice things now that I would not have noticed when I first saw it, but if you can take that with a grain of salt, the shows are still neat. It is also neat to see cameos by a lot of stars that became iconic of the era.

I remember this show, and watch it for the nostalgia factor.  However, TV viewers have become a lot more sophisticated over the years, and I find that the shows I remember being ""great"" are a lot cheesier than I remember.  A person watching ANY series from this period for the first time may find it a bit simplistic, but this show has the advantage of the incomparable Ricardo Montalban, who pulls off the mysterious, sometimes slightly sinister, Mr. Roarke as no one else could.  The fantasies generally run in such a way that the client gets what they NEEDED, but not necessarily what they thought they WANTED, and there is usually a happy ending for them, but the middle can be a bit dark, and the eerie mix of benevolence and (apparent) chilling indifference to the fates of the clients makes the stories much more suspenseful. (Along the lines of:
""Mr. Roarke, you have to get me out of here, I changed my mind!""
""Oh no, Mr. ___, once you the fantasy has begun, there is no way to stop it."">look of polite concern<
 ""But they're gonna KILL me!""
 ""Well, then Mr. ___, if you don't find a  way to meet their demands, it would appear that you will die..."" >professional smile< )
Of course, the back-and-forth with ever-present Tattoo adds the warmth and comedy that keeps you from feeling that Mr Roarke is in any way evil, and lets you know that it will all work out in the end, so the show ends up being a feel-good program.",1323820800,6,2006,4.29973474801061

2408614,5,B000B8IA3U,"I was an avid fan of Fantasy Island when it first came out way back when. There is still a lot to appreciate about this show, even though it is HEAVILY stylized for its time. I'd forgotten that some of the stars played guest roles on the show. And some of the guest stars, who are still with us today, haven't been in the public eye recently, so it was fun to see them in their leisure suits and bouffant hairdos.",1311811200,,413,4.111111111111111
2408615,4,B000B8IA3U,"I purchased this series primarily to see formerly well-known actors past their prime in the 1970s.  I remember watching many of these episodes on their first run, so the format is familiar, but the retro 70s flashback is great.

The plots are pretty thin and telegraphed.  The fun is in seeing the likes of Henry Gibson and Jane Powel acting out their fantasies under the watchful eye of Mr Roarke.  There are also memorable episodes such as Bert Convey trying to escape from Devil's Island with the help of Robert Clarey (Sgt LeBeau).

If any of this means something to you, then it is worth having a look.  The packaging is fine, and the DVD copies are mostly clean (not HD, and with some picture 'noise'), but there are no extras.  So, if you were hoping for an insider's look with Ricardo Montalban or a shmooze with Herve Villachez, look elsewhere.",1300665600,,853,4.6092715231788075

They are notorious for ending the release of a series after a season or two. Some real geniuses working there. I'm now stuck with partial runs of Fantasy Island, Hart To Hart, etc... If you like to collect full runs of classic TV shows like I do, it's almost better not to buy the first seasons from Sony in the first place.

If the studios think by holding back they are going to make a bucket load of money down the line they are very mistaken as most of the people are getting older like me. They will lose market share of these older TV series from the 70s and 80s. I have all of Magnum PI and The A Team and a bunch of 80s shows, as I am 42 now i was a teenager when these shows were on in New Zealand in the early 80s and loved them , but when talking to someone who is in there teens about them they look at you like you are from another planet when you mention these shows to them. We have a big discount store here called The Warehouse they had The Brady Bunch all five seasons of them on special they did go quick but i looked at the people buying them and they must have been in there late 50s early 60s so i think in the end there will be less and less of people buying these older shows. So the beancounters at Sony , CBS and all the other studios that have the rights to these older shows you guys need to get off your backsides and release the rest of these classic shows as in a few years there will be no one left to buy them. And I tell you what drives me bananas is this Vol 1 with 12 episodes on it which is normally half a season being released at a time for a outrageous price,  this is just ripping people off , the whole season guys or don't bother about it.",1267142400,9,1556,3.8625

I remember being instantly hooked on the show and looked forward to seeing the different guest stars each week fulfill their fantasies or dreams. Each fantasy was like a different show within that hour long period and each fantasy never seemed to turn out the way you thought it would which made the show even more interesting. Ricardo Montalban and (Da Plane!, Da Plane!) Herve Villachaize were great in their roles as hosts of Fantasy Island. I still love watching it and see it has fun and nostalgic. And in my opinion I still think it holds up well for that unique style all its own.

My biggest fantasy is that they would all be released this year along with the rest of ""Love Boat"" since so many of the actors in one show also appeared in the other. But I never got to see Ricardo Montalban appear in ""Love Boat"" - now that would have been amazing! I remember watching both shows late Saturday night when I was a student and wishing I could experience the fantasies in real life, especially meeting Mr. Roarke and experiencing a fantasy of my own. I also enjoyed Ricardo Montalban as Khan in Star Trek but except for small parts in some early movies, he never seemed to have any major roles. I was sorry when he died and I think that Sony missed an opportunity when they chose not to release the rest of Fantasy Island at that time. Maybe the shows from the 1970's are not as popular as the current ones, but people who were kids or teens back then do appreciate the shows.",1261785600,4,1004,4.2894736842105265

All this was orchestrated by a Ricardo Montelban who was clearly enjoying himself, as well he might, since he never had it so good. The only unanswered question (aside from whether Montelban's Mr. Roarke was God or the Devil) is when we'll ever get more seasons of this deleriously entertaining show. If names like Bill Bixby, Karen Valentine, and Bert Convy simultaneously make you sigh and snicker, then come to Fantasy Island!",1231286400,,639,4.925925925925926

exciting and kept your interest. I sure wish that season two would come out soon.",1213401600,2,150,3.870967741935484
2408632,5,B000B8IA3U,"I grew up watching Fantasy Island as a kid and I came across the dvd set of season one by accident. I watched the entire series and loved it. I was reminded of the catch phrase ""The The Plane"" shouted by Tatoo whenever the plane would arrive with the guests. The series was aired in the 70s, which you can tell by the clothes and guest stars of each episode.

I would higly recommend this series to anyone, especially if you grew up with it or those wanting to discover the series for the first time. I would describe the show as a mixture of supernatural, fantasy, action, drama and humor, something for everyone.

The premise of the show is that each guest will pay the host Mr Rourke whatever they can afford and have a fantasy of theirs come true. They come to the island by plane and the guests are from all walks of life and ages.

Often the fantasy they paid for does not end up the way they anticipated, some of the fantasies paid for by the guests can become dangerous, however Mr Rourke and his able assistant tatoo are always on hand to make sure things to do not become life threatening. They often step in when required. Mr Rourke takes a personal interest in each fantasy and he will help guide the guests when the need it and he will teach each person a life lesson if they need it.

Mr Rourke may not be human, he could be an angel or something more mysterious, because some of the fantasies he creates can come from the guests past or from a period of time in history and the way they are created does lead the question, who is he really? Even his assistant tatoo has his questions.

While I was thrilled with season 1, I still have not seen season 2 and apparently sony who distributes the series has no plans to release it due to poor sales. So everyone who has bought it and has seen review to keep the hope alive of season 2 being released.",1213401600,9,1861,4.245762711864407

Only now, as an adult, do I realize how truly cheesy these programs were.  However, there is something to be said for the predictability they possess.  In general, one can count on a happy ending and tight resolution for the characters...it's a good show to have in on a rainy day when you don't want to do anything but watch a short man in a white suit scream ""Da plane, Da plane.""",1202860800,,528,4.313131313131313

2408642,5,B000B8IA3U,"Sony Pictures listed on their brochure (version 10) of available TV shows on DVD, that ""Fantasy Island"" Seasons 1 and 2 were produced.  This week I noticed that their version 11 now listed only Season 1 as available.  I and others are disapponted, especially after reading that Season 2 was produced and ready for sale.  Sony, please get it straight!  We are waiting patiently for additional seasons of this great show.

When I reflect on classic TV shows other than comedies or ""good guy/bad guy"" dramas, ""Fantasy Island"" rates among the very best.  Great cast, very well written stories with fresh content each episode.  How nice it was to enjoy great programming like this without concern for language and scenes that would require shielding our kids/grandkids from inapproriate content. Also as I viewed Season 1, I remembered the quality guest stars that were hosted.  ""da plane. da plane!""

Again Sony, please give us the entire series.

UPDATE 4-2-2009:  Well it is now over two years since I wrote my review, and STILL waiting for Season 2!  I sure hate it when Sony and others produce a Season 1, get us excited that one of our favorite TV series will be revisiting our homes, and then just as our appetites whets for more, our hopes for additional seasons diminish more each year we wait.  Look at ""Quincy, ME""; it has takem 3+ years for Season 3 to be announced.  C'mon studios, this is like tempting a dinner guest with a great steak dinner, and then after their 1st fork-full, snatching their plate away.",1173484800,22,1517,4.740458015267175

If you buy DVDs to not just watch the show but to enjoy the bonus material, you'll be disappointed with this. I've only watched the first three of four discs so far but the ""Bonus Material"" (under ""Special Features"") on them is nothing but commercials. The first DVD has commercials for other DVDs this company wants to sell (e.g. The Partridge Family and 80s movies like The Big Chill, The Karate Kid, St. Elmo's Fire, and Stand by Me) and the second and third DVDs has what they titled ""Teasers"" (snips of the episodes, like a commercial would show) for Fantasy Island episodes that are on THAT DVD!
