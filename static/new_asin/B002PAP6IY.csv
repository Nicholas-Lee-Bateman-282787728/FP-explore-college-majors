8376841,4,B002PAP6IY,"Really Funny!  I recorded this movie and watched it for the first time, and I laughed almost all the way through the movie; it was too funny! The family is obnoxious and loud every step of the way to New York.  Marie Dressler starts things off with the family trip by giving a stuttering Train ticket clerk, a rough time with third-degree questioning, to losing her ticket money down her bra and dress, while jumping up and down while in the front of the line!  LOL!  Then, the train trip begins with their bratty boys in tow, while trying to find their beds on the train and disturbing the fellow passengers.  A whole lot of laughs with this movie as the family finally arrives in the big city, and create havoc with Polly Moran and her family, while Marie Dressler is reminded that she is there on the Charity of her sister's money.",1468800000,,834,4.42483660130719
8376842,5,B002PAP6IY,"Marie Dressler is the star in this otherwise drab movie. If it weren't for her I wouldn't have wasted my time watching. She was a comedic genius and the top actress of the early 30's.
So sad that she passed away in 1935. Without a doubt she  would've had several more Oscar worthy film roles",1459123200,,291,4.290909090909091
8376843,5,B002PAP6IY,"Quite humorous. A great tribute to Marie Dressler, a woman who succeeded in Hollywood w/o being beautiful. Too bad she did not have the opportunity to live to make more movies.",1455840000,,176,4.709677419354839

8376845,5,B002PAP6IY,"This is a real screw ball slapstick set in a beauty salon rune by two sisters. But the acrimony over the romances of their daughters is the basic plot. The team effort of Marie Dressler and Polly Moran is outstanding and keeps you laughing all the way to the end. Director Charles Reisner used the full comedic potentials of these two ladies to produce this offbeat comedy. Anita page and Sally Eilers played the roles of their daughters; and William Collier Jr., and William Bakewell as their boyfriends. Strongly recommend this slapstick to all pre-code fanatics and the fans of comedy movies and Marie Dressler.",1446508800,,614,4.857142857142857

8376847,4,B002PAP6IY,"Reducing(released Jan/30) was a very popular entry in the Marie Dressler cannon of motion pictures. It was to be the second to last film with Moran,who proved to be a great character for Dressler to work off of. The film stars,among others,Dressler,Moran,Anita Page and Lucien Littlefield.
The story finds Dressler's sister Moran running a successful beauty business in New York City. Moran pays the $200.00 to ship Dressler,her hubby and her two boys,out to NYC to stay with them;a fact Moran constantly reminds her of. They arrive and it's a teary reunion with the two sisters. Soon Dressler is working in her sister's salon and a bull in a china shop understates what Dressler's behaviour is like;though her heart is in the right spot. Along with this are the sister's two daughters. Moran's has been seeing a rich dude for quite some time and now that Dressler's youngin' has entered the picture,he is now eying her and a nose is getting way out of joint.
The sisters have already been verbally battling off and on, but now Moran(whose rep is at stake) can't take it anymore and Dressler and family move out of Moran's place and into their own. Meanwhile Dressler's daughter and the rich dude are getting closerthanthis. Moran's daughter,whom Marie had slapped unintentionally for being so insolent,now comes over hat in hand. Marie isn't so forgiving until Moran's daughter pleads with her to get her man back....because,by inference,we find out she's pregnant. Marie goes right over to the rich dude's place and lays it on the line....and rightly,he does the honourable thing and marries her that night. Marie is a witness.
Back home Marie confronts her daughter and tells her what has happened. As she tries to console her daughter,who should come by but Moran,hat in hand. Her high hat-ness has disappeared,as she has also learned the truth of what has happened. Like their first meeting at the train station,it's another tearful reunion as the film fades to black.
This film swings from comedy,to drama to pathos,and back again throughout its run,and the success of it is due to only one person,Marie Dressler. The old war horse she was,she had a presence like  no other and could""give"" with the best of them. Dressler adds many,many small touches that were not scripted,such as nose wiping/scratching,and eye lid raising,and any number of assorted gestures that simply complete the moment in a particular scene. Her comedy chops are well in evidence,and Moran's salon provides some good laughs,usually at Moran's expense. There is not a dry eye in the house with that teary ending.
Technically speaking the film is in its full screen a/r and is clear and crisp. Defects commonly associated with films of this age are still visible.
All in all one of Dressler and Moran's better vehicles together. Dressler steals every scene she's in;one cannot  get enough of her. That was the beauty of doing a roughly 80 minute film;it left you wanting more,and MGM knew it. Dressler would eventually win an OSCAR for Min and Bill,but to me that was just a we-had-to-do-something gesture. Dressler made MGM a ton of cash and Min and Bill was not one of her best films. It was slow paced and terribly stodgy. Dressler could and should have easily gotten one for this film over M & B.It's wonderful to see her again. We need more of her MGM catalogue released. There's a whole new generation out there waiting to rediscover this great actress.",1391472000,3,3437,4.903780068728523
8376848,5,B002PAP6IY,"A great comedy from Hollywood's premier studio,at the time.
Miss Dressler, and side kick, Miss Moran play sisters, when they are teamed up again to plague each other when one asks the other to move to New York and help in her Reducing/Beauty Parlour.
Combined with the comedy there are underlying sub plots which at the time may have seemed a little daring to suggest on the screen.
However being M.G.M. the production values are very high and all ends well which is what audiences aof any generation have come to expect.
A great film, well worth watching.",1351123200,2,556,4.683673469387755
8376849,5,B002PAP6IY,"One of the handfuls of comedies she made with Polly Moran, ""Reducing"" is a comedy with big laughs and plenty of heart. The ""heart"" being Marie Dressler, of course. Judging from this film, it's easy to see why moviegoers voted her #1 at the box office, for she could liven up any line of dialogue or work wonders with that expressive face of hers--one which, ironically, could act circles around any of the ""gorgeous"" actresses Hollywood could offer. Marie shares top billing with Polly, but don't be fooled; they're not officially a team. Polly is clearly in support of Marie, who has the bulk of the scenes. But what interesting looking character actresses--Polly with her large nose, weak chin & buck teeth; Marie with her weathered, unglamorous features.
Marie plays a gal from South Bend who loads her brood onto a train at the request of well-to-do Manhattanite sister Polly, who owns a swank health spa. Things go wrong from the very beginning, from the opening ticket scene to the cramped berths to arriving at the spa. As family goes, the kids annoy everyone else, Marie's husband fumbles, and sisters quickly get on each other's nerves as niceties are exchanged one moment, then sharp-tongued bickerings the next.
There's some terrific moments of broad comedy, particularly in Marie's unfamiliarity in the spa's operations, bringing one disaster after another. Though the two actresses share indignities (Moran gets dumped into a mudbath and trapped in a steam closet; Marie's ticket money slips down her dress, and she falls out of a train berth) early on, the second half of the film deepens as Marie helps untangle romantic knots for young lovers, then finally reconciles with her sister.
Almost a foreshadowing of situation comedy which Lucille Ball would perfect years later on television, ""Reducing"" has a nice balance of broad comedy, amusing dialogue and wisps of pathos.",1348617600,8,1888,5.035143769968051
