1991936,3,B0001DMUYA,"Lloyd Bridges was a stage actor who had been kicking around Hollywood since 1936 and had an established reputation as a rock solid actor--but even after a decade of work he still hadn't acheived front-rank stardom, and it would be another decade before he found his true calling in television.  Barbara Payton was something else again, a beautiful blonde with a sultry voice who was in fact a runaway wife and mother who began as a model and after two bit parts suddenly jumped to co-star status alongside Bridges in the 1949 TRAPPED, a low-rent tale of Treasury agents on the track of counterfiters.

Bridges was expert and reliable, but Payton was the real deal, a woman on the fast track for major stardom.  TRAPPED was just a stepping stone, and within a year she was deemed such a significant talent that she was cast opposite none other than superstar James Cagney in KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE, a film for which she received spectacular reviews.  But this would actually be the peak of her career.  She was indeed beautiful and talented, but she was also incredibly unstable, and after a series of affairs with everybody from Howard Hughes to Bob Hope, she crashed and burned in a sea of booze and scandal, and reduced to scraping by on grade-D movies like BRIDE OF THE GORILLA.  By 1955 her film career was over, and she became a street prostitute turning tricks for five dollars a pop.  She resurfaced when a john cut her stomach open with a knife, and parlayed the incident into a ghost-written autobiography, I AM NOT ASHAMED, but nothing could pull her back from the gutter depths to which she had sunk.  She died in 1967 at the age of thirty nine, probably as much from sheer exhaustion as from liver disease.

It's a bit hard to believe Bridges as a gangster, but his performance is more than adequate; John Hoyt as Agent John Downey also rises to the occasion.  But the real reason to watch TRAPPED is to see what all the fuss was about over Barbara Payton, and she doesn't disappoint.  Jailed counterfiter Bridges agrees to help the treasurery department track down his old gang in exchange for early parole, but he pulls an escape as soon as he is on the outside and makes a bee-line for girlfriend Payton.  Little does he know that his escape has been anticipated and is part of the treasurery agent's plan, who goes into hot pursuit, and in the process discovers that Payton is every bit as tough--and maybe tougher--than her boyfriend. Needless to say, however, everything ends the way you expect, and indeed there is nothing original about the film at any point.

The DVD is released by Alpha, and like most Alpha products it is sloppy.  The picture is jittery, the sound is weak.  Add to this a commonplace script and nondescript direction and you haven't got anything much.  Except, as I have said, Barbara Payton. She soon became a byword for Hollywood disaster, but at the time of this film she was talented, a knock-out, and well worth a look.  Recommended on that basis alone.

1991937,3,B0001DMUYA,"Directed by Richard Fleischer (Fantastic Voyage, Conan the Destroyer, and Red Sonja) Trapped (1950) is a grade B noir that at times contains impressive stylistic imagery and dialogue, but overall falls short of being a true ""underground"" B noir classic. For a succint, yet revealing synopsis of the film read the review by Dave.  My comments are directed toward a few scenes that detract from the effective realism that exists in other exemplarary noir films.  First a stunt double is clearly used for John Hoyt, who portrays the undercover Secret Service agent Hackett in the fight scene between him and Tris (Lloyd Bridges).  Later in the film, Hackett, his face showing no effects from the vicious rumble, meets with Mr. Sylvester to arrange another meeting.  Wouldn't Mr. Sylvester notice Hackett's facial renmants of his brutal fight? It is worth mentioning here that the three fight scenes in the film are realistically directed and acted. It was pleasing to view a 1950's film fight that did not end with a character being knocked out with one punch. (Why did George Raft, James Cagney, and Humphrey Bogart so often look like boxing champions on the screen?) Other shortcomings of the film were the car scenes.  A moving background screen is clearly evident behind the  stationary studio vehicle-too cheesy.  Why is Tris, who is a prison inmate in his opening scene, not dressed in prison garb? The film's finale also shows amateurish camera work, when the pursuers seem to jump to ""fast-motion"" when startled by Mr. Sylvester's buzzer blunder. Trapped does not contain the moral struggle that challenges the protagionist in many classic noir films.  Instead viewers are introduced to a cold-hearted crimminal, Tris , who Lloyd Bridges plays to the hilt.  John Hoyt plays the undercover Secret Service agent who we find is the one that is really trapped. In conclusion, the opening scenes of the film with a narrative of the powers of the U.S.Treasury is well documentated.",1183075200,,1980,5.030581039755352
1991938,3,B0001DMUYA,"Trapped is a pretty good movie I think. Lloyd Bridges plays his role well. An escaped, tough con on the run and trying to make one last big score so he and his girlfriend can go to Mexico. Barbera Payton is his girlfriend and man is she a hottie!

The movie starts off with a quick high school type lecture on how money is made and all the other responsibilities of the US Treasury. After that we learn of the evils and perils of counterfitting.

The feds discover a resurgance of counterfit money that had Lloyd locked away. They make a deal with him for early parole if he helps the feds catch the new counterfeiters and recovet the plates.

But Lloyd has other plans. What ensues is a cat and mouse game between the feds and the counterfeiters. When the undercover agent gets his cover blown, the fun really begins.

This is one of those great old flicks that would probably be a blockbuster if it was remade.",1177459200,3,912,4.378698224852071

1991940,4,B0001DMUYA,"Passport Video presents ""THE ULTIMATE FILM NOIR"" (1945-1953), --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- ten tantalizing tales of Film Noir on five suspenseful discs --- featuring top performances from the '40s and '50s with outstanding drama and screenplays, along with a wonderful cast and supporting actors to bring it all together ... another winner from the vaults of Film Noir Hollywood gems.

Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe Hollywood crime dramas that set their protagonists in a world perceived as inherently corrupt and unsympathetic...Hollywood's classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s...Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography, while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Depression...the term film noir (French for ""black film""), first applied to Hollywood movies by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, was unknown to most of the American filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs..the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics; many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film.

Five-disc collector's set includes ""SCARLET STREET"" (1945) (95 mins/Universal Pictures), featuring Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Dan Duryea and Margaret Lindsay --- ""DETOUR"" (1945) (67 mins/PRC), featuring Tom Neal, Ann Savage, Claudia Drake and Edmund MacDonald --- ""THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS"" (1946) (117 mins/Paramount Pictures), featuring Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, Kirk Douglas, Lizabeth Scott and Judith Anderson --- ""WHISTLE STOP"" (1946) (85 mins/United Artists) featuring George Raft, Ava Gardner, Victor McLaglen, Tom Conway and Jorja Curtright --- ""HE WALKED BY NIGHT"" (1948) (80 mins/Eagle-Lion), featuring Richard Basehart, Scott Brady, Jack Webb, Roy Roberts, Whit Bissell and James B. Cardwll --- ""TRAPPED"" (1949) (78 mins/Bryan Foy Productions / Eagle-Lion), featuring Lloyd Bridges, Barbara Payton, John Hoyt, Russ Conway and James Todd --- ""IMPACT"" (1949) (83 mins/United Artists), featuring Brian Donlevy, Ella Raines, Charles Coburn and Helen Walker --- ""D.O.A."" (1950) (83 mins/United Artists), featuring Edmond O'Brien, Pamela Britton, Luther Adler and Beverly Campbell --- ""QUICKSAND"" )1950) (79 mins/Samuel Steifel Productions / United Artists), featuring Mickey Rooney, Jeannie Cagney, Peter Lorre and Barbara Bates --- ""THE HITCH-HIKER"" (1953) (71 mins/RKO Pictures), featuring Edmond O'Brien, Frank Lovejoy and William Talman --- and the documentary ""THE BEST OF FILM NOIR"".

Film noirs tend to revolve around heroes who are more flawed and morally questionable than the norm, often fall guys of one sort or another...the characteristic heroes of noir are described by many critics as ""alienated""; in the words of Silver and Ward, ""filled with existential bitterness.""...certain archetypal characters appear in many film noirs--hardboiled detectives, femmes fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers...as can be observed in many movies of an overtly neo-noir nature, the private eye and the femme fatale are the character types with which film noir has come to be most identified, but a minority of movies now regarded as classic noir feature either...crime, usually murder, is an element of almost all film noirs; in addition to standard-issue greed, jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation...a crime investigation--by a private eye, a police detective (sometimes acting alone), or a concerned amateur--is the most prevalent, but far from dominant, basic plot...in other common plots the protagonists are implicated in heists or con games, or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs...false suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements, as are betrayals and double-crosses...amnesia is far more common in film noir than in real life, and cigarette smoking can seem virtually mandatory.

This collection of ""The Ultimate Film Noir"" (1945-1953) --- still has the magic that we remember from those bygone years --- but as long as we have the labels and networks who play and show these wonderful films of yesteryear, they will never be forgotten --- plus the Bonus of Best of Film Noir on the final disc --- and a great job by Passport Video for this release --- looking forward to more of the same from the '40s and '50s vintage...order your copy now from Amazon or Passport Video, stay tuned once again for more remarkable films from the vaults of classic television and Hollywood during the Golden Era of Film Noir --- All My Heroes have been Gumshoe Detectives!

1991941,3,B0001DMUYA,"A young Lloyd Bridges shines in an otherwise plodding and routinely told story of an escaped convict on the hunt for forged treasury notes plates.  For those who like their tough-guy movies to be filled with corrupt officials, be warned.  TRAPPED starts out with a pseudo-documentary look at your Treasury Department and goes on to depict the T-Men as flawless through the rest of the movie.

  Bridges' performance is probably worth the price of admission.  He plays a soft-spoken, gum-chewing thug with not quite enough street smarts to realize how close the government men are on his trail. There's also a good, movie capping chase scene in a trolley yard.

  The print quality is almost uniformly bad, and some scenes blur in and out of focus. Most annoying is something that happens at about the mid point of the movie: At the end of a grainy scene the large words ""Video Calibration"" appear in the middle of the screen and remain there for about 5 seconds.  It makes you wonder if these companies even LOOK at these disks before selling them to the public.",1097971200,11,1062,4.7228260869565215

VERY good forged money is being passed. and CON LLOYD BRIDGES is in the big house for past bogus money schemes. The Treasury Feds cut a ""deal"" with greedy Bridges who will do anything to get out of Prison.  a ""fake escape"" is part of a plan to get BRIDGES close to the master forger and his plates. But Bridges quickly cuts and runs and ends up at his ex girl friends place on the lam. LOL but the FEDS already have the girlfriends HIDEAWAY ""bugged"" and know the couples every move. This is a good movie and Bridges is very good as the very dislikeable con who wants the good life at any cost. The Feds out fox Bridges who is soon back in the slammer and now they close in on the master forger. Made by the same director of T Men better direction than plot. I give it 3 stars worth watching once for the Greedy GAL who LOVES Bridges and the money he promises no mater what it takes.",1373241600,,980,4.12565445026178
