5634900,4,B00BJAP4BU,"I would have given 5 stars if they had shown all her races, but they left out all of 2010, which were the most hard fought and exciting races, were she won some of important races as the defending champion.  Even the one last race she had, and lost, the Breeder's Cup Classic,, as defending champion,even though heartbreaking, showed so much heart, and unbelievable, almost winning it (if just a lenght longer) after being so far behind lost only by a head.  By not showing it, looks like they were ashamed, which she had nothing to be ashamed of; she was all heart and courage.  That last year including the last race, showed how great she was, and it was ashamed that it was left out!!",1423267200,3,687,4.436507936507937
5634901,3,B00BJAP4BU,"So, I love Lady Z, but why not all the races?  This ends at the Breeders Cup Classic, and there are not extras, very bare bones",1410739200,2,127,3.8846153846153846

5634903,5,B00BJAP4BU,"Everything I watched on this DVD was really well done. BUT, why oh why was Zenyattas' last race(her only lifetime loss) NOT included on this DVD??? Even though she lost this race, she ran as gallantly and showed as much courage as she did in all of her previous races. I believe this was a big mistake.",1402358400,9,302,4.315789473684211

8569407,3,B00BJAP4BU,I loved what was there but very disappointed that it didn't cover her last year of racing. Left me a bit disappointed,1512604800,,117,4.363636363636363
8569408,2,B00BJAP4BU,"Very disappointing. Only interesting if you never followed her career. 90% was rehash of the Youtube-available videos of her races; the rest is well-worn video of things like her owners receiving awards. VERY lazy filmmaking with nothing at all new, in video or in information. In fact, there is almost zero of video about her that is NOT already on Youtube. Save your twenty bucks.",1506816000,,382,4.892307692307693
