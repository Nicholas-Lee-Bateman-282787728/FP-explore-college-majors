8195408,2,B000QCQ7X6,"Overall, this item will be of interest to enthusiasts and practitioners of Shaolin arts in general and those practicing the Five Animal style.  However, don't expect much and do expect problems.
THE DISK: I have four DVD players and three computers in the house, and every DVD player had problems playing this disk.  I was unable to launch main play from the main menu but was able to get some of the scenes to play from the scene selection menu.  Similar problems occured on two computers, one of which had the two differing video programs lock up when ""main movie"" was attempted from the main menu.  This disk is obviously a low budget production and not done with care for proper DVD stucture.
THE CONTENT: Essentially it is a demonstration of the shorter Dragon routine by the demonstrator/instructor. There are sectional breakdowns with repetitions at normal and about 2/3 speed. There is not actual instruction being presented, so those with little to no training in Shaolin fundamentals will have difficulty here. Those familiar with well known Five Animal Fist routine should have little trouble following and implementing the routine based on their established skills.  Again, this disk does not qualify as instructional material by comparison to what has been produced by other teachers, masters, and schools, but may be of interest to the curious and the reasonably experienced.",1190332800,6,1389,5.074561403508772
