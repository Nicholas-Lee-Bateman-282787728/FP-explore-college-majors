6471510,5,B00L5R1XXU,"I love the beach they used to make this dvd, this is going to be soooo wonderful going through the winter, however I am new to essentrics and I love the peaceful work, if you put your all into each move I have no doubt that you will have more flexibility and toned muscle's, I am very happy with this purchase, Im not sure you can use just this one dvd to transform your figure,  if you like peaceful workouts, with low volume music which I like, if you need to increase your flexibility this will help you. I hope she makes another one in the same place or one very much like it, maybe with a little cardio or moves to increase your heart rate some more. Edit 4-21-15 I used this today and did the first 2 workouts back to back, I am out of shape, however I am sore already and couldn't finish the ab workout, so if you put your mind to your muscle's you will feel your body working hard, I actually was sweating and shaking, just thought I would share what it was actually like using this dvd for the first time. Edit 11-12-15 been using this 3 times a week rotating with the Class of 2012, some times rotating with Turbo Barre DVD, This really does Tone up your legs, your lower back so no more muffin top, YEA. and flattens your abs, I don't use the arm workout though, this is the toughest in my opinon of the Essentrics dvd's, I can hardly wait for another strengthening one to come out, This is my favorite way to work out now. Thank you Sahra.",1429488000,12,1451,4.1637010676156585
6471511,5,B00L5R1XXU,"I'm not someone who would do any ballet or barre type workouts and I was a bit hesitant to order this DVD, however it is a wonderful workout.  It is not strictly ballet, but more a flowing stretching workout.  The Jamaica beach setting is so beautiful and the music is relaxing and suitable.  I like Sahra as an instructor and she is very good with her cueing and explanations of which muscles are being worked with each movement.  The 3 workouts give you a whole body workout, but they can be done individually too. Highly recommended!",1429228800,21,536,4.552083333333333
6471512,5,B00L5R1XXU,"Very pleased, use this DVD almost every day. It showed uo in mail on time. Thank you!",1428710400,,85,4.0588235294117645
6471513,5,B00L5R1XXU,"I own several dvd workouts by Classical Stretch. This is another amazing routine that helps your body feel amazing, while sculpting your body. Essentrics keeps me moving and flexible.

Update: 4/1215 - Still love essentrics and classical stretch. The only advice I would give, is the purchase directly from the site. Prices are too high here unless you get free shipping.",1419638400,13,371,5.081967213114754

6471515,1,B00L5R1XXU,"This is a ridiculous cd..work out is not all challenging, she does not explain things well, and repeatedly mentions how sandy she is getting and how ""tough"" it is on the beach. I am not all all familiar with the series and purchased it on a whim, and I am super disappointed. It seems like an amateur just got someone to film her on the the beach. I don't often write reviews, but thought I should save someone else wasting their money this.",1416182400,12,441,4.325301204819277

6471517,5,B00L5R1XXU,"These workouts are absolutely lovely. I would say they are sort of a hybrid of Tai Chi, Ballet Beautiful, and Tracy Anderson. Nice and flowing, graceful, lots of stretching, and just easy breezy. They are NOT as grueling as Ballet Beautiful or Tracy Anderson. Not as many reps, and less specific work into each muscle. But, I wouldn't say they are too easy or boring. I think these workouts marry perfectly into a routine with lots of harder stuff going on, like Zuzka, Andrea Orbeck, or Sylwia Wiesenberg (to name a few) or basically any Tabata, Kettlebell, Crossfit, or Boot Camp sort of workouts. These are short and refreshing enough to be done on a ""down"" day or as a pre or post-workout stretch to increase range of motion.",1415491200,26,729,4.658914728682171
6471518,5,B00L5R1XXU,"I've recently discovered Essentrics and am extremely happy I did! This is a fantastic workout to develop long, lean muscles and seriously improved posture. The beach setting and Sahra's personality make the 30 min fly. You're constantly engaging your core, focusing on posture, and leaning out your legs. 30 min is perfect if you want to add it on to a cardio workout and still be done in an hour. I absolutely love Essentrics!",1409961600,31,427,4.783783783783784
6471519,5,B00L5R1XXU,"I have a few Classical Stretch DVDs, but this is the first Essentrics workout I've bought -- and I really like it!  I waited to write a review until I'd done each of the workouts twice so I could make sure that I had a good feel for the programs.  What I love about them is how you feel both toned and stretched after doing each one.

The DVD consists of three separate workouts:

*  Ultimate Leg Sculptor

*  Ab Flattening & Waist Shaping

*  Arm Blast & Posture Boost

Each workout is just about thirty minutes long, and to do the workouts you just need a mat and a chair or barre.

From the main menu, there is no option to play all of the workouts, but once you click on a workout, it goes right to the workout, so you don't have to watch any FBI or health warnings.  I really appreciate this, but it would have been nice to have had some sort of matrix so you can link two workouts together, which is how I've been using these.

As mentioned above, this DVD was my first experience with Essentrics, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  The instructor Sahra reminds me a lot of her mother (Miranda, who does the Classical Stretch workouts), and has a really calm, pleasant demeanor.  If you're familiar with Mary Helen Bowers' Ballet Beautiful workouts, these remind me a bit of BB, but Shara also focuses on stretching while doing pulses, and the exercises themselves are very unique.

I've been combining these with Tracy Anderson, PiYo, and Tonique the last two weeks, and I really love how stretched out I feel after doing these.  Also, as Sahra mentions, each one really is a full-body workout, even if the title of each workout makes it sound like you're targeting one area of the body.  For instance, in the Arm Blast segment, you also stretch the legs as you work your posture.

Since adding these in, I've noticed that my posture is better, and I'm not getting the lower-back and hamstring tightness that I often get after doing other workouts.

The background on this is also gorgeous; each workout is filmed on a beach in Jamaica, and the music is soft enough that you can hear the waves as you work out.

Overall, these are very unique workouts -- ones that leave you energized and feeling lengthened after you do them.  They're perfect for days when you want a gentle workout that will make you feel good afterwards.",1409875200,56,2336,4.434272300469484
6471529,5,B00L5R1XXU,"After doing her short workouts on YouTube for a week,  I felt a big difference in my posture. So I ordered a few of her DVDs. Easy to follow after a few times practising on YouTube. I wish they were available on instant video. I had to buy a DVD player just for this but worth it.",1469923200,4,280,3.912280701754386

6471531,5,B00L5R1XXU,"The three routines on this DVD are perfect at 30 minutes each. The focus on abs, posture and arms, and lower body make for a nice set to cycle through in a week. Sahra is clear with her cuing, and the setting, on the Jamaican beach is perfect--it is so relaxing to do her routines while watching the waves, which you can hear, splashing onto the beach and watch clouds, ships, and paddleboarders drift by in the background. These routines are extremely effective in shaping and toning our trouble areas, and I would say the routines are a bit harder than her Stretch and Strengthen set. Which is good for variety!",1459468800,9,613,4.531531531531532

It was working fine for over a month and then this week I tried to do a workout and it just kept returning back to the menu. I think that these products cost a little too much to have these defects. I am only pointing it out because the same happened with another one that I also received, Full Body Toning, otherwise I would see this as a one time thing.",1522972800,,415,4.0120481927710845

8663938,3,B00L5R1XXU,i really like the workouts but there are definately flaws in the workouts. sometimes she forgets to repeat moves for the other side and she also talks about irrelevant things to the workout sometimes. the workouts themselves are really nice though. i recommend making your own music playlist and just follow along with the workout on mute.,1483833600,3,339,4.964912280701754
