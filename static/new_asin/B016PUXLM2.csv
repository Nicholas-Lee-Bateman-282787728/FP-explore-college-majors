7479473,3,B016PUXLM2,The preorder BR price is too much for an average performance that is not all new songs.,1451433600,5,87,4.176470588235294
7479474,3,B016PUXLM2,"Not up to par as far as I'm concerned. No all-out show stoppers,and they don't even have the full orchestra and singers for this performance. I've never rated CW anything other than five stars, but this performance REALLY disappointed me. I don't mind the traditional Irish music, not at all, but it was so DULL. They usually have at least one or two rousing performances where the audience really gets into it, but there's nothing so lively in ""Destiny."" While familiar favorites like ""Amazing Grace"" garnered the greatest audience appreciation, many of the songs received what I thought was ""polite"" applause. They did get a few standing ovations, including at the close of the program, but the whole thing, audience included, just seemed ""subdued"" to me. I thought Susan McFadden's rendition of ""Sometimes a Prayer Will Do"" was the highlight of the show. Many of the other songs were Irish favorites from previous shows so I didn't find it fresh or particularly appealing. And I didn't care for the large screen background with different scenes projected onto it. I found that distracting. I've never had the opportunity to see a live CW performance even though I've always wanted to go. However, I must say that I would pass on this show. Generally, it wasn't bad but it wasn't especially good either. Even having Meav back wasn't enough to lift this sagging performance. I wonder if CW is winding down after ten years; seeing this show makes me think that might be so. Don't get me wrong: I am a HUGE Celtic Woman fan, but this performance I would simply describe as ""lackluster."" Someone commented it was ""their best ever"" but as far as I'm concerned, it was their worst ever. It's not terrible but it's not what I've come to expect from Celtic Woman either.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destiny-DVD/dp/B016PUXLM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destiny [DVD</a>]",1449360000,27,1910,5.184466019417476
7479475,5,B016PUXLM2,"The previous review was spot on. The only thing I will add is that the songs are traditional Celtic. No more tributes to Broadway, which is fine with me.  The faces keep changing but the quality of the performances remain excellent",1448928000,22,231,4.634146341463414
7479476,5,B016PUXLM2,"The ""Celtic Woman: Destiny"" PBS concert was filmed in the Round Room at the Mansion House in Dublin, Ireland on August 13, 2015.
After seeing this concert on PBS on November 29, 2015, I have to say that this concert was absolutely amazing
and that the renditions of all 19 of the songs on the PBS broadcast version were truly spectacular.

Former full-time Celtic Woman member Meav Ni Mhaolchatha returned and performed three songs during this concert.
Fiddle player and violinist Mairead Nesbitt is the only original Celtic Woman member from 2004 that still hasn't yet ever left the group.
Susan McFadden returned, the first Celtic Woman DVD that she had ever appeared on was ""Celtic Woman: Home for Christmas - Live from Dublin"",
first released in 2013.

Mairead Carlin, Eabha McMahon and Rebecca Winckworth are all making their Celtic Woman DVD debuts on the ""Celtic Woman: Destiny"" DVD.

Meav Ni Mhaolchatha, Susan McFadden, Mairead Carlin, Eabha McMahon & Rebecca Winckworth all have such angelic and beautiful singing voices.

I've been such a big fan of Celtic Woman ever since their first ever PBS TV special first aired in the United States in March of 2005.

I gave it four stars in lou of five because David Downes is missing from the stage. In order for this to feel familiar to us Celtic Women fans, it must include his presence. It's already hard enough to get used to the turnover of the CW members. I will always miss the five original members ~ CW will never be quite the same without them ... But this concert of present members did a beautiful job and each woman has something special to offer the group. I am glad I have added this to my collection.",1487462400,,551,4.064220183486238

7479492,2,B016PUXLM2,"Ill begin by saying I truly love Celtic Woman and own many of their performances.  It seems that greed has sadly trumped all.  I say this because:
Both the audio and video production values of this performance are mediocre at best.
The Blu-Ray was released with a simple 2.0 stereo audio track, no high definition surround as is generally expected to accompany the Blu-ray format.  In fact there is no surround at all - No DTS, nor even lowly Dolby 5.1 surround.  For an audio performance this is unpardonable sacrilege with the technology of today.
The video quality for a Blu-ray is merely adequate.  The production value is almost non-existent with a simple screen projection backdrop, a sparse set of choir, and/or backing musicians and minimal wardrobe changes as present in other performances.
The performances themselves are relatively uninspired as if the girls are simply going through the motions.  I realize CW may be becoming or dare I say has become pass.  This thought I believe is reinforced by the lackluster production/performance overall.
It is unfortunate that what once was truly magical such as what was done in A New Journey (which would be FANTASTIC in High Definition) has been stripped down to something merely ordinary, apparently for the sake of shaking loyal fans down for cash.",1483228800,2,1306,4.990783410138249

Saw the Destiny special this past St. Patrick's Day and found myself enjoying the songs and the singing. Eabha McMahon is a great addition to the group and has a beautiful, haunting voice.

The performances were, by and large, good, and I generally liked the song selection.  But it didn't seem that the whole show lived up to the standards of previous Celtic Woman shows.  The staging was quite poor, and the lighting was atrocious.  It almost seemed as though the budget had been cut.  Perhaps that might also account for the lack of extras on the disc.  And David Downes's arranging was sorely missed.  (Where did he go?) Although there was a fairly good mix of traditional and more contemporary-oriented selections, more of the arrangements seemed to lean a little more toward pop than usual, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just not what you normally go to Celtic Woman for.  As I said, it was enjoyable, and I don't regret obtaining the BRD at all, but it didn't live up to earlier shows, such as ""A New Journey"" or ""Songs from the Heart.""",1457395200,4,976,4.505681818181818

7479560,4,B016PUXLM2,"I must say i enjoyed this concert very much. I'm quite impressed with the set list of songs performed and also the music. The moods and the atmosphere created is amazing. As a fan who has collected all the Celtic Woman Concert DVDs & Blurays that has been released throughout the years, I can assure you that this concert certainly does not disappoint.
But the only thing I have to complain about is on how the chorus is producing a gigantic amount of sound when its obviously seen that they are not wearing any forms of microphones. It clearly confuses the viewers on whether they are genuinely performing.

7479566,5,B016PUXLM2,Well I will say this about this production. The video was what looked like HD. However I was greatly disappointed that the audio track only came in two channel stereo. What was up with that?? Most commercial BD releases are at least in five channel surround. The Girls were great along with the song selections. Was not sure I liked the screen in the background as it seem to limit the players as to not creat shadows on it. Also the lighting would have been better but the backdrop was an issue. Overall I did enjoy the concert with the exception of the noted issues.,1455753600,,568,4.419047619047619

7479582,5,B016PUXLM2,"I have been a Celtic Woman fan since 2006.  I enjoyed this concert.  Some thoughts:
I originally did not care for Susan McFadden since the management of Celtic Woman stupidly had her singing the great Lisa Kelly's songs like ""Caledonia"" and ""The Voice.""  I now consider her to be the highlight of the group.  Not only is she the prettiest member of the group since Lisa Kelly but she has a stage presence and charisma that Celtic Woman hasn't had since Lisa Kelly and Lisa Lambe left.  When she is on stage, you cannot take your eyes off her and she has the prettiest smile.  Her two solo numbers are standouts: ""Sometimes a Prayer Will Do"" and ""The Whole of the Moon,"" a number that was not shown during the PBS showings of this concert, it is terrific.
I saw Mairead Carlin in concert with Celtic Woman two years ago at Radio City and she did not create much of an impression on me.  However, she did here.  Her two solo efforts are also standouts: ""Like an Angel Passing Through My Room"" and ""I See Fire,"" (the theme from the second Hobbitt film.)  With her beautiful little girl face and curvy figure, she looks great in the blue gown she wears in the second half of the concert.  She doesn't move around a lot like Susan, but she has an almost hypnotic effect on you.
I'm not sure about the new Celtic Woman, Eabha McMahon, she looked to me a little nervous and uncomfortable at times although I did enjoy one of her numbers, ""Walk Beside Me.""  Another pretty blonde, Rebecca Winckworth, sings and plays the harp on ""Isle of Innisfree.""  Reminds one of previous member, Orla Fallon.  She had a nice voice and I wonder whether she was in consideration as the new Celtic Woman before Eabha.  Perhaps they felt she was too similar looking to Susan.
Mairead Nesbitt, the heart and soul of Celtic Woman, appears in most of the numbers, one wonders what they would do if she ever decides to go.  Original member Meav also appears in several numbers.  I've always considered Meav to have probably the best voice of any of the members of Celtic Woman, so it is a treat to have her back. Another number not on PBS is ""Tir na nOg.""  The four girls from Celtic Woman all dressed in blue are joined by someone named ""Oonagh, dressed all in green, who sings and dances around like a sprite during the song, it is a very entertaining number.  Other standouts include ""When You Go,"" ""My Land"" and the fantastic concluding number ""Westering Home,"" performed by all the girls plus Meav and Rebecca. (A little criticism, I think its time to put a couple numbers like ""Amazing Grace"" and ""Siuil a Run"" to rest.  I've always felt no one did ""Siuil a Run"" better than Orla Fallon on the first Celtic Woman DVD anyway.)
This is a very entertaining concert, the best since ""Celtic Woman Believe.""  The additional numbers not seen on PBS are outstanding. It would have been nice if the Blu-Ray had some special features like a behind the scenes look but, sadly, it does not.  It is nice that they have finally started releasing the concerts in high def. Blu-Ray, I wish they would re-release the previous concerts on Blu-Ray as well. This wonderful concert  makes me look forward to seeing the girls in person in Brooklyn, New York this June more than ever. I already have my 3rd row Orchestra seats.",1453593600,20,3281,4.506756756756757

Without the talent that this group had in the past, this CD is indeed a disappointment.",1453507200,3,251,4.555555555555555
7479588,3,B016PUXLM2,"No David Downes as music director here and it shows. The group/ensemble contains the same basis: 3/4 beautiful women with great voices but lack the quality of the backing. For all the other Irish shows there has always been an orchestra which adds depth to the performance and helps to create the show. Here there is only a backing band like they have on tours. On their previous DVD ""Emerald"" they got away with it because the performances were energetic and pulsating and the dancing added to the spectacle. On this DVD the show lacks enthusiasm and excitement and the backing seems underwhelming. The songs, while well done and sung very well, tend to be slow on the whole when compared with the previous great songs which came to define Celtic Woman such as Teir Abhaile Riu, Mo Ghile Mear and Isle of Hope These defining songs are no longer there. Perhaps the management believes that without David Downes they have to go in a new direction.  But they have gone too far. Most of the songs are now slow and lack the song that you can't help singing long after the DVD has stopped. If this is the new direction then they have lost their way. What a pity for I have always loved Celtic Woman. Lets hope they revive what they once had.",1453420800,3,1236,4.493333333333333

Lots of new and original  material from this very talented group who have given so much pleasure to so many over the years all over the world, Now entering their 11th year,the group are all so talented and while the line up may have changed over the years (for family & personal reasons) the pool of talent within Celtic Woman appears to know no boundaries. These three girls, Mairead Carlin, Susan McFadden and the newest member Eabha McMahon, supported by the wonderful Mairead Nesbitt on the fiddle, just have so much talent and it is obvious from their performances in the Destiny DVD, that they enjoy what they do. Individually and as a group their interpretation of each and EVERY song on the Destiny DVDi is just magical. Mairead on the fiddle has a God given talent and has been with Celtic Woman from day one. Just wait until you hear their performance of 'Siuil a Run"" and ""Destiny' . Great to see  the wonderful Meav return for this performance. Together with guest Rebecca,,all the girls sing the rousing ""Westering Home' and if this does not stir your blood then nothing will! Once again I will be lucky to see them in concert on Apr 6th in Norfolk VA and I cannot wait to hear their angelic voices.",1452988800,3,1329,4.556485355648536

7479596,4,B016PUXLM2,"This performance felt like a B Movie to me. Destiny does not even compare to their previous productions. I would rate Destiny as BLAH. Certainly not another ""Live At Slane Castle,"" which is probably my favorite Celtic Woman production. This entire production lacked sparkle, enthusiasm, and there was nothing to emotionally draw me into the performance.

On the VERY positive side, this is in BluRay. YESSS!  The resolution is so high that I added a star. The audio is mixed very well, both vocal and instrumental.

The venue feels like my old high school auditorium...Not impressive at all. And that rear screen projection -- it was just goofy and cheap feeling.

Each of the girls' performances was outstanding...that was not the issue here. Susan McFadden was her usual excellent self and performed very well. The always impressive Meav's token appearances in Destiny were just not enough. Mairead Nesbitt's performance was brilliant, as always. The two newer women, Mairead and Eabha, have beautiful voices. Eabha's charisma will certainly blossom over time. However, despite all that talent, the production lacked that ""Celtic Woman Family"" feeling.

This performance has taken us back to the amateur level that we all saw on their first DVD. But THAT production had more excitement all around, great musical selections, even a better venue than Destiny.

Now that I've seen it, if I had it to do over, would I buy it? Heck yeah, I love Celtic Woman!",1452816000,2,1455,5.041666666666667
