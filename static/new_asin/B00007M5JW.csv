2365261,4,B00007M5JW,"First, what's right: excellent ebb & flow by the conductor, terrific orchestral playing, and fine singing, particularly the singer doing Frank. But what the f... is up with this production? The opera is purposely surreal to begin with, so the added elements by the director only serve to make a mess of the plot. The kid coming out of nowhere during the Lute Song, Paul clutching that doll like a perv, etc. Oh yes, there's more, and it's all the more confusing if you're already familiar with the story.
Korngold was one of the 20th century's greatest composers, and hearing this work should leave no doubt of that in anyone's mind. Such an individul voice he had! 2 measures is all it takes to identify the composer's hand. This opera should become a rep staple again. Even this misbegotten production should help it on its way toward regaining its place on the stage.
The DVD is still worth buying because it's a great work, though this performance is presented with a number of cuts, which seriously disturb the flow of the 1st act. Once you get over the visuals it can even be fun, like watching a terribly garish fashion show.
By the way, nobody reads Kobbe anymore.",1083024000,2,1172,4.639423076923077
2365262,3,B00007M5JW,"The production designer seemed to  think the primary  focus should be on his talents rather than the actors or composer. Angela Denoke was wonderful, Toesten Kerl efective as the ill fated hero.  They had to do battle with the sets and costumes.  It was difficult  to  understand Korngold's opera because of the poor production.",1061424000,8,328,4.981481481481482
2365263,4,B00007M5JW,"Suppressed by the Nazis as ""decadent"", this wonderfully inspired
score has Straussian ebb and flow, volcanic eruptions, tender, touching moments, unusual, colorful orchestral effects, not to mention unforgettable melodies. Puccini's influence is distinct, but more of the modern, incisive Puccini of La Fanciulla del West
and Turandot, than that of the earlier, sentimental La Boheme.
There are reminescences of Wagner, Richard Strauss and Mahler, but these are influences never copies.
The 23 year old (!) Korngold is already showing his lion's teeth
in the highly original,inventive and tremendously impressive Bell sequence in the second act: Giant bells of different pitch toll incessantly with the pounding of percussion creating an impression of the dead city, Bruges ,in the night, with its gloomy
mediaeval streets, canals and bridges, the famous cathedral looming in the background.
Unfortunately this is not what we see on the stage, however. The director, instead, has other ideas. He gave us too much light, neon lit cafes, nuns in silly looking hats and other cheap effects. This, I think , dilutes the otherwise fine production.
On the positive side: The first act is fine and follows the composer's intentions faithfully. Even the frantic doll-clutching
works well, indicating Paul's fanatical obsession, symbolically.
The mirror effect and other cinematographic devices are interesting and suitable for a modern 20th century work, such as this. The bellowing skirt, al la Marilyn Monroe, is cute.
But apart from presentation,one should concentrate on the music and singing, which are the essence, and here we doubly get our moneys worth! In the tricky dual role of Marie/Marietta, the gorgeous
German soprano Angele Denoke carries the day. A natural redhead, she sings,acts and dances to exaltation. In the gruelling tenor role Tornsten Kerl braves the monstrous difficulties, though signs of strain are noticeable. After all, this is like singing Tristan continuously for an hour and a half.
A great highlight for me is the long love duet at the end of the
second act, with varying moods in succession (anger, doubt,sadness, awakening ardour and unconquerable passion).
At the end of this duet the lovers fall into each other's arms, much like in the wonderful finale of Sigfried. Even the concluding melody has some similarity.
The conducting of Latham-Koenig is excellent in controlling a huge orchestra of a sustained vulcano, bursting at the seams underneath the action. We can still look up to the late, great
Erich Leinsdorf, but Latham-Koenig is a worthy successor.
One can go on and on. I give it 4 stars, though it probably deserves more were it not for those directorial excesses and self indulgences I mentioned.
Very recommendable for all those curious to SEE this opera (since
it is highly unlikely they will see it anywhere else). Three (or four) cheers for Opera de Rhin and, of course, Arthaus.",1059868800,26,2927,5.256410256410256
2365264,4,B00007M5JW,"In the ongoing battle between great operas and pretentious, self-impressed production designers and stage directors, the operas usually win hands down.  After all, they have the advantage of all that great music, all the beautiful poetry, all the genius!  And, here too, Korngold and his heart-melting opera ""Die Tote Stadt"" do emerge the victors, but just barely!  There is so much to admire about this release.  It's filming is state of the art, and should be a model for future attempts to put staged opera on the screen.  The singers are universally fine, and it's Marietta, Angela Denoke, is a revelation.  But if there were ever a production which showed utter contempt for the vision of the creators, it's this one.  In the place of the braid of his dead wife's hair, Paul cradles a small doll, and strokes it's hair.  He apparently has his wife's skeleton hidden under the floorboards, and during ""Marietta's Lied"" he strokes the skeletal hand.  Later, he drags her shrivelled corpse around the stage with him.  Marietta appears to be pregnant in act III, and, worst of all, in an opera which inspired hope in the ruins of post-World War I Germany, he inexplicably stabs himself to death as he sings his final lines.  Yet, for all the intelligence insulting rubbish in this staging, I had a hard time not giving this release five stars, because when Marietta sang her final aria, tracing her past from the gutter to finding her own faith, I couldn't help but feel my heart leap into my throat, and couldn't stop the tears welling up in my eyes.  But all that is to the credit of Mr. Korngold, and Ms. Denoke.  They deserve eight or ten stars.
Yet, complaints aside, anyone who loves Korngold, or the splendid intensity of late romantic opera should still see this, because in the end, it IS the opera that triumphs.",1045353600,61,1823,4.712933753943218
2365265,4,B00007M5JW,"The Opera National du Rhin has staged Die tote Stadt as a depiction of Paul's decline into madness, ending in suicide.  This differs from Korngold's conception, and from typical stagings (e.g., New York City Opera's), in which Paul enters a dream about Marie/Marietta, but ultimately breaks free of it.  To me, the altered staging adds nothing to the value of the opera.
But for those of us who love Korngold's music, it is still wonderful to see and hear this opera on DVD.  Angela Denoke and Torsten Kerl are excellent portrayers of Paul and Marietta.  Birgitta Svenden is a nice bonus as Brigitte, and Yuri Batukov is more than adequate as Frank, as are all the other supporting singers.  It is intererting, however, that Kerl, a light-voiced tenor, seems to be working mightily to sing the role just as Rene Kollo did in the old LP version that is now available on CD.
I'd rate this five stars if it weren't for the sometimes distracting antics associated with Opera du Rhin's ""innovative"" (OK, Eurotrash) staging -- nuns morphing into prostitutes, members of Marietta's troup dressed as drag queens, Paul fondling a skeleton on the stage, Frank as a bishop in the third act, handing Paul a knife or razor with which to kill himself, that sort of thing.  Yes, I see what they were driving at, but no, I don't think it was a good idea.",1043798400,2,1338,4.648305084745763
2365266,5,B00007M5JW,"I'd give this more that 5 stars if I could.  This DVD definitely makes up for some of the more boring ones I've purchased.  If you're adventuresome and want something that is a challenge, GET THIS!  It's perverse, it's garish, it's over the top!  But remember, Die Tote Stadt translates to The Dead City and it is about a man's overwhelming obsession for his dead wife and his dream, or better put in this director's point of view - nightmare.  The first act only hints at what is to come in acts 2 and 3.  I found the ending heart wrenching.  Does it all work?  No.  But those things are easily forgotten compared to the rest of the production, singing, and gorgeous music.
The two principles sing and act as if their lives depended on it.  Torsten Kerl is truly magnificent in the difficult role of Paul and Angela Denoke as Marietta is almost his match.  It must have been an electrifying night in the theatre.  My only complain is that it has too soft a focus and at times seems slightly blurry, especially during distance shots.  A word of caution - if you have a good sound system, be careful.  You could use parts of this recording to break your lease!
If your tastes run to the standard operas and conventional stagings, this is definitely not for you.  But if your at the other end of the spectrum or at least willing to try something new, order this one now!",1043712000,30,1368,4.394422310756972
2365284,4,B00007M5JW,"This is a dark production, and one in which many viewers will find cause to quibble (that ever present dolly clutched by our troubled hero). It is also a well sung and recorded performance that is quite moving at times. Until something better comes along, this will do nicely.",1170720000,3,276,4.653061224489796
2365285,4,B00007M5JW,"At long last we have a video of this neglected masterpiece.  The production could be better, but for Europe at this time it is fine.  The work contains a haunting aria, ""Gluck, das mir verlieb,"" which will stay with you forever.  Puccini saw it in Vienna a few years before his death and said it was great.  I agree with Puccini.  Korngold, of course, wrote memorable movie music - Robin Hood, Captain Blood, Sea Hawk, King's Row, and others.  The heldentenor should lose a few pounds, so he can move around the stage better.",1168819200,5,525,4.531914893617022
2365286,5,B00007M5JW,"One does not always expect a superior operatic production from provincial opera houses, but Korngold's DIE TOTE STADT (The Dead City)is an exception. This thoroughly atmospheric masterwork, performed at  Strasbourg's Opra du Rhin, is superb in every way: the singers are of world-class excellence; musical direction is equally first-rate; and the sets are outstanding. The most pleasant surprise comes from the work of stage director Inga Levant, who gives this 20th-century opera an updated conception that still remains faithful to the original version. Soprano Angela Denoke and tenor Torsten Kerl achieve unforgettable interpretations.",1167955200,3,639,5.870967741935484
2365287,5,B00007M5JW,"We cannot put ourselves in a position where we accept only one vision of an opera.  There are no operas or plays that ""must be"" staged and/or set in a certain way. ""Rigoletto"" in a gentlemen's club? ""Cosi fan tutte"" at a diner?  Why not?  The staging is nothing more than a vehicle. In the end, it's always about the opera.  To dislike a production because of staging is akin to disliking a person because of their fashion choices.

The staging in this production of ""Die Tote Stadt"" is polarizing, of that there is no doubt.  I actually liked the use of the doll through the opera.  In my mind, it showed graphically the depth of Paul's obsession with his dead wife.  It made the obsession over the top and set up the end beautifully.  This opera does, after all, utilize a dream device. Given that, we should evaluate the staging in the context of a dream.

The performances were fabulous.  One reason this opera is not performed more frequently is the difficulty of casting the character of Paul.  This is a monstrous role that places huge demands on the singer.  I was absolutely blown away by Torsten Kerl.  This guy puts the ""helden"" in heldentenor.  In addition to his powerful yet controlled singing, he gave his all as an actor.

His partner, Angela Denoke as Marietta/Marie, is a fine performer.  Her arias were beautiful.  ""Marietta's Lied"" is always risky, since the aria is in the standard rep of every lyric soprano.  Any performance of this aria will inevitably bring comparison.  She brought her own interpretation, and I was particularly impressed with her note onsets and her beautiful pianos.  Her acting was also very good, as she is able to rouse sympathy, then antipathy, then sympathy again.

I think this was a wonderful production.  I was completely engaged from start to finish.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1161820800,11,1834,4.712933753943218
2365288,4,B00007M5JW,"I have seen ""die tote Stadt"" on stage 8 or 9 times in Germany. It was shown on German TV in a 1980s production from the Deutsche Oper Berlin; this was available on DVD for a short while but is now n.l.a.  In the absence of this fantastic production (directed Brian Large), you have no choice but to buy this one.

The production is bizarre; but no more bizarre than is the fashion in most German opera houses (the Bremen version is particularly weird).

The music is fabulous: like an exotic cross between Puccini and Richard Strauss with added sugar and extra volume and melodrama. It has 3 show stopping arias.

The DVD cast is good, the playing fine and the production interesting and perfectly comprehensible IF YOU KNOW THE OPERA; if you want audio, get the Leinsdorf RCA set (which has the bilingual libretto too). Avoid the recent Salburg CD set (dubious vocals, no libretto); if you are dead mean, the Naxos Stockholm set is fine (but no libretto in English).

Ideally you want the 1980s Berlin set. But you may have a long wait. The opera is being performed this year in Berlin, Vienna, Barcelona and maybe Ghent. Maybe it will get onto a new DVD from one of those sources.

In the meantime, buy this one.",1136505600,12,1214,4.52054794520548
2365289,4,B00007M5JW,"I might have a higher opinion on this Opera du Rhin 2001 production of a work and composer musicologists rather pointlessly still debate whether both are minor or major and which generated hot debate (which as I notice permeated to this website, as can be gathered from browsing through the entries by other fellow reviewers). As the specialised press on both sides of the Rhine did, you'll either hate it or love it. The well known English critic Alan Blyth, writing for Gramophone magazine when the set was issued in Europe, rather dismissed as ""bizarre""; I wouldn't go as far as a whole, although the second act actually comes close, its conception being unnecessarily odd, perhaps verging on the grotesque.

Any way, this is the product of a wunderkind of 23 to me still in the process of duly assimilating the various musical influences he was exposed to: Richard Strauss is never far behind, as neither are the Puccini of his last works or even the viennese operetta composers of the time. In fact, most of Marietta's vocal part is characterised by a soaring utterance (which Denoke no doubt relishes and for which she seems very apt and abled) typical of the vocal lines of female parts in  works like Der Rosenkavalier, Ariadne auf  Naxos or Die Frau ohne Schatten. The work is uneven, reaching heights of perplexing beauty besides segments perilously about to cross the boundaires of the sugary or schmalzy sentimental, viennese style (and that is to say something). References to the successes of Jeritza and Tauber in the protagonical roles, and wielding them as criticism arguments against Denoke's and Kerl's accomplishments have lost any significant relevance to me in 2005, as the 1930's are by now too remote from us and I sincerely doubt anyone's memory to be reliable enough after so much time as to make the comparison viable; or, for that case, as may be evidenced from reconstructed 78's.

So, if you're bent on exploring the unfamiliar or willing to expand your repertoire, Die Tote Stadt may be of interest to you. With superior performances from the four principals (Angela Denoke, Trosten Kerl, Yuri Batukov and Birgitta Svenden), luxurious sounds from the Strasbourg Philharmonic and impeccable conducting from Latham-Koenig, and if you put up with some questionable aspects of an irregular staging concept on the part of stage director Inga Levant and Magali Gerberon's costumes (especially in the second act), you'll enjoy this Arthaus Musik release, which by the way features an informative and helpful booklet that puts composer and work into due perspective and context; I'd wish companies like Kultur and Image, normally furnishing no more than a leaflet with a  chapter index, followed this practice. The programme includes no additional material, regretfully, but carries menus in 4 languages and subtitles in 5.",1109462400,11,2846,5.059701492537314
2365290,2,B00007M5JW,"I realize this opera is enjoyed by people I respect. To me, however, its means far too greatly exceeds its content. The deconstructive production contains insights here and there, but is mostly laughable. Contrary to others' opinions of Angela Denoke's singing, I found her voice, while accurate, shrill, grating and unattractive. Kerl's Paul was excellent. The sets were some of the worst I've ever seen: there was so many dark protrubances on the floor, the singers spent most of their time keeping from stubbing their toes and falling down. What physical interactions there were were awkward and unnatural.

The music is hyperromantic and magnificent, the sentiment essentially adolescent: one's seeming inability to go beyond first love. The second one will cure you--if you accept it. The rest is irrelevant mumbo-jumbo.

A simple, realistic setting of Act I is mandatory for the opera, thus I would not recommend purchasing this DVD. Buy the Leinsdorf CD and imagine it yourself until a better production comes along.

For something twice as grandiose for a core meaning even less significant, try Korngold's ""Das Wunder der Heliane,"" then go out and buy a Hummer for driving down to the 7-11.

Update (10-7-08): Just saw the San Francisco/Vienna State Opera production of this opera. Fabulous! It made me realize how bad the production was for this DVD. The music so terrific, it's worth the wait for the proper DVD, which should show up before long. I'd now take another star off the rating if Amazon would allow it.",1109289600,15,1524,5.035714285714286
2365291,3,B00007M5JW,"Ever since I was fortunate enough to see this opera in a Berlin Opera production I have longed to see it again. So when the dvd came out I was thrilled.  I read the reviews and purchased it with some reservations, since some of the reviews were so negative, but it is the only production on dvd.  I have two very fine recordings on cd one with Renee Kollo and Carol Neblett and with the Royal Swedish Opera, both sumptuous and very satisfying. This production is such a disappointment.  It's beautifuly sung and the acting is very fine which unfortunatly can't overcome this garish and sometimes laughable production. (Why that silly doll instead of his wifes braid) It is a perversion of the composers intent. So until a better one comes along listen to a cd and use your imagination.  I give the singers 5 stars and the production a 1..",1103587200,13,838,4.529801324503311
2365292,4,B00007M5JW,"I too, hated the production.  Using a knife to kill Marietta in his dream, instead of strangling her with his dead wife Marie's long braid of hair (so lovingly kept in a glass case) was truly stupid!

In response to those who wondered about the teenage boy in formal attire in act one during the lute song:  he is the personification of Korngold.  Find a picture of him about the time he wrote Violanta or Der Ring des Polykrates (age 14) and you'll see the resemblance.

Just another example of this stage director trying to be clever:  having a youthful incarnation of the composer come out to ""play"" the piano and ""accompany"" the top 10 hit that was/is ""Mariettas Lautenlied,"" although witty, hasn't got ""squat"" to do with the libretto or the plot.

Good performances:  bad production!

Get the 1975 RCA recording (Neblett, Kollo, Leinsdorf) listen to it with the libretto in front of you:  you'll conjure up your own clear staging and know exactly what it should look like.  This set designer and director had no idea what this opera was about.  Makes me wonder if they even read the stage directions in the score.",1099526400,12,1118,4.6479591836734695
2365293,4,B00007M5JW,"This is a magnificent opera. Let us not forget how successful it once was. According to performance statistics, of all the operas first performed between the 2 World Wars this opera was - during that period - the most performed; its rivals included several Strauss operas, the later operas of Janacek, Turandot, Oedipus Rex,Wozzeck, L'Enfant et les Sortileges and others which are now part of the standard repertoire. There are many IFS: if the Nazis hadn't banned its performences; if the label of Film Composer hadn't been hung around Korngold's neck; if the once fashionable cul-de-sac of serialism had exerted less influence in the 20 years post World War 2 .... would Die tote Stadt have retained its popularity?  If you are prepared to travel around Europe, then these days it's once again possible to enjoy different productions of the opera most years. The promised new production at Salzburg may indeed set the seal on the opera's rehabilitation and, with luck, that too might receive a video recording.

Is the Opera de Rhin production one which reveals the full measure of the work? The answer must be .... partially, but not completely. For that, you would have to go to, say, the Stockholm production or the Gotz Friedrich production which toured several European cities.  Musically, it's excellent. Torsten Kerl (as Paul) and Angela Denoke (as Marie/Marietta) make the most of their very taxing roles and the conducting of Jan Latham-Koenig is first rate.  It is the production which is problematic.  The end of the opera can be interpreted positively - showing Paul coming out of his obsession with his dead wife; or negatively - showing the obsession overwhelming him. In this production there seems little progression, either upwards or downwards - he is totally obsessed from beginning to end.

As much of the opera is a dream sequence, it is an invitation for producers to go over the top and for me that part of the production does work. The end of the opera, where Paul seems driven to madness and suicide could work even better if the first half hour of the opera gave more of a contrast. It's perhaps an old-fashioned sentiment, but I don't feel that a bombed-out church works as a set for a middle-class home in Bruges.  The production's idea that Paul keeps not just mementos of his dead wife but her actual skeleton is interesting and would be even creepier in a more normal setting.

Neverthless, despite the faults, it's still fascinating.",1090800000,7,2467,4.885167464114833

Sometimes I wonder how far directors are willing to go to create something ""new"".  I have no problems with the musical part: the singers are excellent.

8074870,3,B00007M5JW,"... and introduces Richard Strauss. Erich Wolfgang Korngold's opera ""Die Tote Stadt"" premiered in 1920 and remained quite popular in Europe for several decades befoer vanishing from the stage. The 'symboliste' novel, Bruges-la-Morte by belgian Georges Rodenbach, on which Korngold's opera is based, was published in 1892. It would seem, therefore, as several previous reviewers have complained, that the morbidly expressionist Freud-heavy staging in this production is NOT what Korngold intended. Even the synopsis in the notes to this DVD suggests a radically different interpretation, with a 'redemptive' and optimistic conclusion.

Nevertheless, ""what you see and hear is what needs to be reviewed."" In this staging, Mr. Paul spends the first act lamenting the death of his wife Marie, whose memory he has enshrined in his dismal garret in Bruges, a city of dead memories. His moribundity is 'violated' by the arrival of Marietta, a promiscuous dancer of vivid life-force, who resembles the dead wife uncannily. The second act combines a lurid parody of the Commedia dell'Arte with the seduction of Paul by Marietta. The third act returns to Paul's garret/temple-of-memories; whether in reality or in a vision, a sacred procession intrudes. The scene wallows in morbid Christian symbolism, with Paul assuming aspects of Christ and Marietta implying Mary Magdalene. Paul eventually murders Marietta, though it's ambiguous whether it's the real Marietta or the vision. One might think the opera ends there, but no, there's a ""song"" of redemption, at the end of which Paul also kills himself. Frankly, though I'm ready to suppose Korngold had something quite different in mind, this poor opera in this production is an orgy of religious death worship, such that even Wagner might have found excessive.

The music is another question. It begins at full ecstasy, at an emotional pitch Wagner or Strauss would have prepared for several scenes. It never really relaxes from that pitch. Believe it or not, total ecstasy, full bore romantic rapture, can become rather tedious after an hour or so. I found the music surprisingly well composed, but I can't say that I enjoyed it much. And that was true despite the wonderful singing of the two principals, Torsten Kerl as Paul and Angela Denoke as Marietta. The roles are very demanding musically -- physically -- as well as dramatically. Such singing deserves a more coherent staging ... and perhaps a better opera.",1269216000,3,2458,5.2360406091370555
8074871,2,B00007M5JW,"I'm fond of this opera and accept the proposition that it offers wide latitude for interpretation by the stage director. Enough has probably been said in earlier reviews of this recording about the staging. It's a defensible interpretation of the opera, but I found it ugly and distracting. I will acknowledge that the production brought out, for me, the extent to which the libretto is tied to criticism of the city of Bruges itself, an element that escaped in the two productions I've seen staged in the theater.
I was less pleased with the singing.
Some fine work is turned in by singers in supporting roles, notably Stephan Genz (Fritz) and  Birgitta Svenden (Brigitta); but I found Denoke's voice almost unlistenably harsh in a way that makes her inexplicable casting for the role of Marietta. Kerl has to be saluted for singing the extremely difficult role of Paul reasonably well, but there is no dynamic modulation to relieve his tendency to sing every line at full throttle. It's vocally one-dimensional, and I got tired of it. I doubt I will ever play this DVD a second time, and I hope it will be replaced in the catalogs by a better-sung performance based on a different production. The role of Franz is in Bo Skovhus's repertory and Emily Magee has been singing Marietta in recent seasons; 13 companies have staged it in the last year and a half, so perhaps a better cast can be assembled on DVD, one of these days.",1252972800,5,1428,4.6892430278884465

I wasn't around to see the original nor the Mets version a year later; however, this production admirably captures the spirit of the times with its expressionistic design (merging with the short lived dadaism) complementing the early modern score. The lead singers are superb in vocally exhausting parts, with the male lead due very high marks for sustaining without weakening as demanding a role as there is in opera today. Supporting roles are also performed with excellence and the acting  fulfills  modern definitions of the singer/actor. Obviously each of  us will see what our perspective allows and demands,for those of us who grew up with The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and other illusionist films exploring unconscious motivations and behavior (in the era of psychoanalytic dominance in  the arts)little will appear strange.

8074873,5,B00007M5JW,"I bought this with the CPO Cd's Die Kathrin and Polykrates (which I will review for you later) as a make up and also as I did not have a ""visual"" interpretation. I have the Naxos CD set and first got to know Korngold's music from the Leinsdorf and the Gerhard (film scores) recordings in the '70's. I have now become a ""Korngold tragic"", justifiably I believe, he was a real genius and his increasing popularity is endorsing that! You do however have to like late romantic 20th century music, he nearly always sounds modern too at some stage!

Enough background...what do I have to say about this DVD? Well firstly I decided to ignore some of the reviews on here and just pop it in the DVD player and press play...I soon realized that I wanted English sub titles and set that up and then I was glued to my seat until a toilet stop in the 3rd act! After a 10 minute break to do this and that around the house  I quickly resumed to the end and then I replayed Mariettas Lied. At the end I concluded it had been a privilege to sit and watch this performance it is awesome. Vocally stunning, the acting especially the tenor unbelievable, and the choir and orchestra divine.

  Now to the production and staging, well yes you could dwell on the extreme interpretation but I for one thought with one or two exceptions that it was a compelling visualization and whilst the accompanying booklet gives the usual synopsis the producers variances are not in fact anything more than underlining of those. For instance whilst you think it strange Brigitte sticks a poster of roses to the wall rather than bringing in roses...the poster travels better to the end of the opera as a visual tableau so by the end you understand why a poster and not an awkward bunch!

  The obsession with the dead wife is correct and whether it's the doll with the blond hair or the skeletal hand it seemed in character! One other thing, in sound alone I had never been able to work out exactly what happens in the opera and why, and this production finally solved that for me not that you really need to know to understand Korngold's music it just flows like a stream of consciousness and that is sufficient on its own (I told you you had to like late romantic....).

My only quibbles are the poor diction, I think the Swedish Opera set has clearer sung German anyway the subtitles cure that soomewhat. The other quibble was that dream and actual real sequences are not noticeably differentiated and whilst I would kind of liked that, I was also surprised alongside Paul in act 3 as a result of there being no transformation curtain so perhaps it is better this way. Handled differently this could have been a source of titter but it wasn't, you were also genuinely surprised!

One last rave and that's the costumes, lovely, stunning and just one more reason to have this DVD - oh and the sound is very good, almost no audience noise and only one obvious cutout of applause so a tremendous effort by all concerned!",1193184000,7,2982,4.4953789279112755
8074874,2,B00007M5JW,Turn off the video and listen to the top quality DTS sound and musicians perform Korngold's best opera.  The stage production would have turned Korngold over in his grave. It is so distracting from the music it is a useless part of the DVD.,1189209600,11,240,4.454545454545454
8074875,4,B00007M5JW,"I love this opera! I had high hopes for this DVD, but was met with disappointment--though not through any fault of the singers. The role of Paul requires a Wagnerian tenor, a requirement amply fulfilled by Torsten Kerl. Angela Denoke is amazing as Marietta/Marie. Not only capable of belting out clarion high notes over Korngold's immense orchestral sound, she can also spin out the most luscious phrases in ethereal tones with gorgeous lyricism. Her ghost scene (Paul's vision of his dead wife) was a revelation for me. This scene often comes off as merely spooky, but this performance was so affectingly and painfully melancholy that I was in tears. I'll echo another writer's admiration of the duet that ends the second act. I found it to contain the most Wagnarian passages in the opera, reminding me of the second act love duet from Tristan, a rapturous intertwining of voices expresses the transfiguration of characters abandoning themselves to emotion.

The production, however, epitomizes the worst excesses of the European penchant for using bizarre symbolism to deconstruct operas such that they become perversions of the composer's intentions. This opera is about overcoming loss: a man in perpetual mourning for his dead wife meets a young woman with an uncanny resemblance to her. A hallucinatory relationship begins and appears to end is catastrophe. Paul, however, comes to realize that he has been living in the illusory past and resolves to leave Bruges, the Dead City, to start a new life. One of the reasons for the wild popularity of the work after its premier was its resonance for many in Europe who had lost loved ones in Wold War I. The redemptive finale of the opera is extraordinary, the music is absolutely transcendent. This director, however, has evidently decided that this is all much too sentimental, so instead Paul slits his wrists and collapses against an upstage door labeled ""No Exit."" Oh...I get it...you can't put the past behind you after all? This after Paul has danced with a life-sized skeleton and sees his friend Frank transformed into some sort of red-horned devil in ecclesiastical drag. I won't even get into the oft-mentioned doll business. It's just too bizarro and the action on-stage often has little or nothing to do with the music that accompanies it. At times, I found myself shielding part of the TV with my hand so I could listen to the music without being distracted by the nonsense happening onscreen.

Until something better comes along, we're stuck with this DVD of Die Tote Stadt.  But don't pass up experiencing this marvelous music and superb vocal performances. Just be sure to read a synopsis first, so you know what the opera is *really* about.",1187568000,6,2711,4.966960352422907
