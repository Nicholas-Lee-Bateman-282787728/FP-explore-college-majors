This story has an explosive beginning. A burglar sorts out jewelry, then leaves. The Gelignite Gang continues their work. Eddie Chapman visits the Isle of Jersey, and finds solitude there. Visitors from the Continent also arrive. Eddie summons the warden to make an offer they cant refuse. He wants to get out of prison, and does so. But he is sent to another prison. Eddie can pick a lock. Shot while trying to escape. Franz Graumann is his new name. Whatever. The German Army espionage system will monopolize his talents. Mistrust everyone. His training begins. He learns how to make bombs (the weapon of spies and other terrorists) out of household products. Can the Germans trust Eddie? Can he trust them? They put Eddie to work checking POWs. Eddie signs a contract. Eddie explains an absence due to a cut hand!

Eddie is flown to his first operation, a parachute drop. He discovers this is another test! Then he is prepared for the real thing. Eddie goes to the police after landing in Britain. They accept his story. British Fair Play? Eddie walks into the Vickers factory as if he worked there. He plants a bomb with a 7-hour delay timer. The explosion goes off as planned. Eddie is recalled to Europe. But first he is prepared for questioning. He is under suspicion when he returns, and must write his experiences in England. He gets the Iron Cross, second class and a promotion. Policemen are necessary to any regime in power says Colonel Sternhagen. Did Eddie slip up over that photo? At a nightclub Eddie meets an old friend, and wants to send a message to England. Are they being watched?

Eddie visits a French restaurant, and runs a close call. There is conflict among the top officers in a meeting on Graumanns next assignment. Eddie will be sent back to England as an observer. The Baron is sent on a long journey. Back in England Eddie will report on the time and location where the rockets have landed (this allows them to be redirected for minimum damage). The war is over, and Eddie gets a pardon for his past criminal record. There is an inside joke here.

I think this story was modified from the actual history. It also has some revisionist history. Books with more facts have been written about Chapman. The Double Cross System by John C. Masterman and The Ultra Secret by F. W. Winterbotham provide an overall view. Information was leveraged to effectively use scarce resources in the Battle of Britain and afterwards. The autobiography of Dusko Popov (Spy Counterspy) is a better story, but unlikely to be made into a movie. Do read his book if you can find it. One reason for the unavailability of this film is the presence of Gert Frbe; he is on a blacklist because of his film work in the early 1940s. There are two books about Chapman: Agent Zigzag by Ben Macintyre and Zig-Zag by Nicholas Booth.",1278374400,,2852,4.652777777777778
7837787,5,6303082645,"Based on a true story, Bond director Terence Young endowed this World War Two era espionage story with his trademark style and panache.
Cat burglar Eddie Chapman finds himself in a jail call on the island of Jersey when the territory is over run by Germany at the outset of the war.
The Germans decide to put Chapmans talents to good use and (after a series of ingenious tests) send him back to England to spy for them. However, Chapman decides his efforts would be better spend working for the allies and begins to send back false reports to mislead his Nazi handlers.
What follows is a taut, fun and entirely satisfying adventure with the admirable cast of Christopher Plummer, Yul Brynner and Gert (Goldfinger) Frobe. This movie deserves a Blu-ray release here in the U.S. (or at very least DVD). There is a DVD release in Region 2.
UPDATE: This movie has been released as a DVD as part of Warner's Archive Collection at:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Triple-Cross/dp/B00AFEYRQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Triple Cross</a>
