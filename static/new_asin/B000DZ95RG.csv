2475743,4,B000DZ95RG,"This Three-Pack is a good purchase. It includes ""Jungle Holocaust"", ""Eaten Alive!"" and ""Massacre in Dinosaur Valley"".

Jungle Holocaust- Is a real serious film that takes an unwavering look at a man's interactions as a prisoner with the cannibal tribe that imprisoned him, and follows him and a sympathetic cannibal woman (the lovely Me Me Lai) after he escapes and tries to find his way back to his plane. It does have some unsettling scenes like a real alligator getting stabbed brutally and cut open by one of the cannibals. The actors do a great job in the film. Heads up though there is quite a bit of nudity...both male and female. It is the first cannibal film that Ruggero Deodato made in his trilogy.

Grade- B

Eaten Alive!- Is a slightly less serious and a little more restrained cannibal movie. It's about a woman who is looking for her sister in the jungle and believes she may be a part of a strange relegious cult. The movie takes more of a ""cult"" turn and has more ritualistic type scenes then ""Jungle Holocaust"" It also uses footage previously shot during ""Jungle Holocaust"" even though the director, Umberto Lenzi claims in an interview it isn't the same scene. (it is) Like the movie mentioned above, this film contains a good bit of graphic violence and nudity.

Grade- B-

Massacre in Dinosaur Valley- In a real campy way, I am most fond of this film, both for the movie itself and the enlightening interview of the star Michael Sopkiw on the DVD. It is about a group of people who are traveling to a place in the amazon where there are suppossed to be a lot of dinosaur footprints and bones, the hero (Michael Sopkiw) is somewhat of a paleontologist and wants to go. Their plane crashlands (is there any other way to go down in these films.) and the party runs into quicksand, snakes, cannibals, and slave traders. It has a fair amout of gore, and more nudity then the previous two films. It co-stars the lovely Suzane Carvalho (who is naked for a good 10 mintues straight) It's fun and bizarre entertainment.

Grade-B+

8102890,4,B000DZ95RG,"The Jungle Horrors Triple Feature, packaged by Shriek Show, includes three films featuring some pretty horrific jungle encounters, cannibalism, nudity, exploitation, and violence, in one very economical package.  Products of Italian studios, the titles included are Jungle Holocaust (aka Last Cannibal World) (1977), Eaten Alive (Mangiati Vivi) (1980), and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley (Nudo e Selvaggio) (1985).

Filmed in Malaysia and apparent based on actual events on the island of Mindanao, Jungle Holocaust is chilling look at civilized man's encounter with aboriginal natives.  Landing deep in the jungle, the passengers of a small plane fall victim to the natives.  One of the survivors is captured, experiencing the abject terror of being at the mercy of a large tribe of savage natives.  The prisoner (Mossimo Forschi) is taken to a huge cave, tied to a rock, stripped naked, yanked high in the air, and then imprisoned.  After killing some natives, the prisoner escapes from the cave along with one of the native women (Me Me Lai), making a desperate bid for freedom.  Harper will find that to survive, he will descend down close to the level of his pursuers.  The DVD has some nice extras, including a commentary track by director Ruggero Deodao (in Italian, but with subtitles).

Eaten Alive is a mind-numbing fantasy adventure set in the jungles of New Guinea, involving cannibals, and a religious cult, similar to that in Jonestown, Guyana.  A woman (Janet Agren) travels to New Guinea, in search of her lost sister (Paola Senatore).  Upon arrival, she enlists the help of adventurer (Robert Kerman) to act as a guide.  The ill prepared pair head into the jungle, and locate the missing sister living at religious sanctuary deep in the wilds.  The group is ruled by a charismatic leader (Ivan Rassimov), who keeps his subjects under control through the use of religion, intimidation, and drugs.  The jungle is infested with cannibals, who make escape from the village nearly impossible.  Enlisting the help of a native woman (Me Me Lai), the outsiders flee the village, and make their way through the cannibal infested forest.

Massacre in Dinosaur Valley, is a quirky, B-movie, jungle adventure, set in Brazil, with fierce natives, beautiful women, gratuitous nudity, violence and gore, evil miners, and a couple of exciting action sequences.  Kevin Hall (Michael Sopkiw) collects fossilized dinosaur bones, and wrangles his way on a fight headed for the Valley of the Dinosaur, hoping to find some new samples.  Among the passengers is a prominent paleontologist, and his gorgeous daughter Eva (Suzane Carvalho).  Tragedy strikes when the plane crashes, killing the professor and several others.  Deep in the jungle, with unfriendly natives closing in, the survivors head out in an attempt to get back to civilization.  Very exploitive and trashy, but still an entertaining time.  Image and sound quality are quite good.  Extras include Michael Sopkiw commentary track, deleted scenes, and a subtitled interview with director Michele Massimo Tarantini.

Jungle Holocaust (3 stars), and Eaten Alive (2 stars) fall into the cannibal film category, while Massacre in Dinosaur Valley (3 stars), is more of an exploitive action adventure.  The collection gets four stars, not because these films are of particularly high merit, but mainly because of value.  The cost of the Triple Feature is the same as or even less than, any of the individual titles, so if you are interested in one of the movies, you might as well get them all.  Chances are, if you like one, the others may also be of interest.",1249257600,,3609,5.135273972602739
8102891,5,B000DZ95RG,"for the price you can get this for (under $15 including s/h) its more than worth it. as with any of the shiek show 3 packs its an excellent deal on quality released classic movies. buying these seperately would cost you a lot more. if you do not own any of these or own one of them than this is worth getting. jungle holocaust is directed by ruggero deodato of 'cannibal holocaust' fame, this came out prior to CH.",1216252800,,414,4.253164556962025
8102892,5,B000DZ95RG,"It's gore overload!!!!!  (As if that were possible).  You won't find more pounds of torn flesh or extra ounces of bloodly spewage for the buck though.  This triple feature rules!
_______________________________________

Jungle Holocaust ('77)
Ruggero Deodato's first glorious tale of cannibalism.  After a plane crash, Robert finds himself all alone in the jungle.  He quickly gets captured by cannibals, and they find great delight in torturing and humiliating him.  This also has brutal animal killings, a plethora of nudity, a real looking child birth, plus the hot Me Me Lai as the tribal chick.  She don't eat meat she sure like the bone!

Eaten Alive ('80)
Umberto Lenzi offers another sleazy catastrophe.  This starts a little slow, but when it gets going--whoa!  A woman bravely surges into the jungle in search of her sister, who joined some extreme cult.  The natives want to eat her, and not in a way she would enjoy.  Besides the basics--animal killing, decapitations, severed limbs, nudity--this also has some nice gang bang action, plus a sex toy dipped in snake venom.  It don't get much classier than that!

Massacre in Dinosaur Valley ('85)
This one gets slightly cheesy for a moment, plus the cannibals don't get enough screen time. It's still good bloody fun though.  A great sex scene helps out, of course.  Plus this has some quicksand.  A velociraptor rape scene would have been a welcome surprise, haha.

My friends puzzlebox and Dave K gave this 4 stars?  They should be ashamed of themselves!! ; )

8102893,3,B000DZ95RG,"They sure don't make italian exploitation movies like they used to. These are three of the most ridiculous cannibal movies ever made. Each movie is chock full of poor acting, poor dubbing, ludicrous scenarios, eviscerations, dead reptiles, scantily clad women, chauventistic males, graphic scenes of gore, rapes, and of course fat hunger crazed cannibals. Jungle Holocaust, Eaten Alive, and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley offer a hearty meal to the hungry cannibal connasieur and should quelch even the most ravenous appetite for quite some time.",1198540800,6,543,5.476190476190476
8102894,5,B000DZ95RG,"i love italien movies and they don't make them anymore like they used to back in the 80`s. If you love cheap effex,blood and gore,bad dubbing,

porn music then go buy it..... + its cheap !! thank you shriek show",1173744000,,211,4.275
8102895,4,B000DZ95RG,"Here are 3 more cult classics out of Italy. 80s Italian horror cinema seemed to be either zombies or cannibals. And most of the time these movies were a lot of fun.

Jungle Holocaust directed by Ruggero Deodato is a very serious movie. A lot of these flicks are silly fun, but this one is serious. First up I just wanna say the DVD is excellent and even comes with lobby cards. The movie itself is quite disturbing, but the problem is for me at least it just doesn't work that well. If something like this happened to you it would be scary and traumatic.

But in a movie you cannot just rely on that. Jungle Holocaust despite the slow pace is a good movie that is disturbing, but could have been a bit more. The gore scenes towards the end were quite brutal.

Eaten Alive by Umberto Lenzi is the more silly cannibal flick, even though I don't think that was the point. Jungle Holocaust worked for the most part even when nothing was happening. The same can't be said for Eaten Alive.

Overall though it's a fun movie though that fans like myself of Italian cinema should enjoy or at least some what enjoy. The gore scenes were shots from Jungle Holocaust.

And finally we have Massacre in Dinosaur Valley directed by Michele Massimo Tarantini. This movie alone is worth buying the set. The movie is so silly and sleazy how can one not love it?

Michael Sopkiw stars and this time instead of playing a Snake Plissken clone like he did in 2019: After the Fall of New York he's playing an Indiana Jones role.

I see this movie as Indiana Jones and the Cannibals. Michael Sopkiw rocks in this movie. As much as I liked him in 2019 I like him even more here.

We get cannibals eating people, 2 women getting it on and a lot of gore. Massacre in Dinosaur Valley is a great cult classic. The movie is so much fun and again Michael Sopkiw rocks!

Like all of the sets put out by Media-Blasters it's cheaper to buy the set than any of the movies on their own.

If you are a fan of 80s Italian cinema this set is a must own. All 3 movies are enjoyable with Massacre in Dinosaur Valley just being a fun ride from beginning to end.",1160092800,18,2119,4.275
8102896,5,B000DZ95RG,"The most attractive aspects of this collection are the film versions.  I will skip the idea of reviewing each title (none are individually 5-star-worthy in my opinion) in favor of the product as a whole and what it means to Gialli / Cannibal / Lenzi / Deodato / Horror enthusiasts.

For many years, these films were only available in heavily cut editions.  Umberto Lenzi & Ruggero Deodato fans rejoiced when their respective films Mangiati Vivi and Jungle Holocaust (Ultimo Mondo Cannibale) were finally released in all of their un-edited glory.  Previous versions of Jungle Holocaust ran less than 83 minutes, here it is a full 96.

Rounding out the set is clearly the most blatantly sexual of the three, Massacre in Dinosaur Valley (Nudo e selvaggio).

If you do not like these films to begin with, this information won't matter.  If you already enjoy or simply know of these films, this 3-disc DVD product is a 5-star purchase.  Buy it before it disappears.  Three full-length features in a single set priced below $20.  With the individual titles selling for $15-20 each, you would be foolish to miss out on this.

Note: Eaten Alive (Mangiati Vivi) is not to be confused with the 1977 Tobe Hooper feature.",1157673600,18,1209,4.820388349514563
