3419516,4,B0018RKEQ4,"It does seem like Fox is trying to milk this Alice Faye Collection franchise for at least another volume with several better entries being omitted. However, Fox is planning to release the films in this set separately, so you can bypass the films you think are of lesser quality or, in the case of ""Four Jills and a Jeep"", seem to have only a tangential relationship to Alice Faye.

Others have written the details of the films so I won't rehash. However, let me point out that ""Hollywood Cavalcade"" has Buster Keaton returning to a supporting role in a feature film for the first time after he was fired from MGM in 1933. He basically plays himself, however here he is in the role of a pie thrower - something he never did in his own films. There is a humorous story of how he surprised Alice Faye with the intensity of his pie attack, and how, after the scene was shot, she chased him for a good distance with her own pie in hand. Keaton did manage to outrun her. It's nice to know Alice's offscreen vitality matched what we saw in her films.",1210291200,10,1043,4.348717948717948
3419517,4,B0018RKEQ4,"why in the world include a film in which Alice Faye is a guest star and is on screen less than five minutes with all the starring vehicles she did for Fox? It makes so little sense one suspects that the people putting these sets together are either idiots or just thumbing their nose at fans.

Sally, Irene, and Mary, Wake Up and Live, Sing Baby Sing ,You Can't Have Everything with Don Ameche and the Ritz Bros. - any of these would be much more valuable releases. Too much to hope that the Fox people read these posts and realize their ""mistake"".

 Otherwise , this is is a great release with four terrific starring Faye vehicles long wanted by fans on dvd.",1210032000,28,659,4.341463414634147
3419518,5,B0018RKEQ4,"The availability of a second collection of films of the charming Alice Faye is welcome. It seems that a new generation are discovering this quality performer and actress and this DVD collection is a worthy valentine to her legacy. Faye's films tended to follow a proven box office formula. She was quoted in later life as drily stating that they merely rotated her leading men as she constantly remade the same story. These films certainly support that view as all the cliches are on view, each with their own twist.

- first off is the 1939 ""Rose of Washington Square"". This is a dramatic musical with a more gutsy part for Faye than usual and an excellent role for matinee idol Tyrone Power as a heel. The story was based on the life of ""Funny Girl"" Fanny Brice who sued the studio for plagiarism. Al Jolson, as Faye's vaudeville buddy, and Faye sing superbly. The film was severely edited before release and many of the cut scenes survive, some of which have been included here.
- next, also released in 1939, is the technicolour romantic comedy ""Hollywood Cavalcade"". This is a nostalgic look at the coming of talkies, a Reader's Digest potted history of Hollywood, with Faye's role based loosely on, among others, Mabel Normand, a silent screen comedian, and Don Ameche on Mack Sennett, a silent comedy director. The film is very well made with soft colouring and excellent performances by the leads but the director Irving Cummings, while meticulous, always directed at a plod. The best scenes are the Keystone Cop comedy recreations, not directed by Cummings, before the films descends into the usual cliches with Faye neglected by her leading man and wearing her heart on her sleeve.
- in 1941, ""The Great American Broadcast"" adhered rigidly to the girl meets boy, girl loses boy, girl reunites with boy formula, this time set around the advent of radio. The plot is a rehash of ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" stirred in with ""Tin Pan Alley"" with John Payne and Jack Oakie re-appearing from the latter film. While it may be flawed history, it is a mighty entertaining film. Faye's rendition of the war time Harry Warren lament ""Where you are"", backed by the Ink Spots, is memorable and the Nicholas Brothers are in there too, performing a breathtaking dance as usual.
- in 1943, ""Hello Frisco Hello"", one of Faye's best remembered films, was released. A period musical rich in familiar and, in this case, particularly tiresome plot cliches, it benefits from spectacular colour, great production values, superb sound and Faye herself, slim, radiant, warm and sympathetic. This is the film in which she mesmerised the audience with her signature tune ""You'll Never Know"", but there are other goodies like ""The Grizzly Bear"" and ""Pick on me"". John Payne and Jack Oakie are with her for the third time, the former as a very stiff and humorless leading man and the latter for some hokey overacted comedy.
- the inclusion in the set of the lousy war time propaganda film ""Four Jills in a Jeep"" is hard to fathom, unless you view it as a sort of bonus. This boring musical traces the factual trip by 4 second rate stars to entertain the boys at the front. Most of the musical numbers are dull with wooden Dick Haymes, loud Martha Raye and voluptuous Carole Landis, among others. One highlight is the athletic dancing of Mitzi Mayfair. Faye makes a guest appearance reprising ""You'll Never Know"". She seems reserved.

With all the entertaining films available to include in the package, ""Four Jills in Jeep"" is a rotten choice. It also should be pointed out that ""Hollywood Cavalcade"" is not a musical, given that this set is another of Fox's ""Marquee Musicals"". The film certainly has the feel of one with a delightful soundtrack of old favourites supporting the melodrama but Faye does not sing.

The set has been beautifully packaged. All of the prints have been restored and are in great condition and the 2 technicolour prints are outstanding. Every film has its own documentary, not only focusing on Faye and her colleagues but on the historical aspects of the yarns - Fanny Brice for ""Rose"", the advent of radio for ""Broadcast"", the history of Hollywood for ""Cavalcade"" and USO tours for ""Jills"". Each of the films with Faye as the lead hit a bullseye at the box office. ""Frisco"" has a charming featurette on Faye herself and her daughter Alice appears, as well as Michael Feinstein and  Hugh Hefner among others.

All the usual marketing material is included such as theatrical trailers, on set stills and advertising. In fact my only complaint is that Faye's exquisite rendition of ""I'll see you in my dreams"" is not among the deleted numbers from ""Rose"". A colourful booklet comes in the box, devoting 2 pages of anecdotes and background information to each film. This nicely complements the featurettes on each DVD. Lastly, ""Rose"", ""Jills"" and ""Frisco"" have audio only tracks. You can view the films with the original studio recordings matched carefully to what is on the screen without dialogue interruption etc - a very neat feature.

The DVD set is excellent value and with the documentaries, the modern viewer will begin to understand just what an important star Alice Faye was and that her contribution to American pop music was huge in her heyday.",1209945600,51,5260,4.819490586932448
3419529,5,B0018RKEQ4,"For fans of late 1930s to mid 1940s musicals this collection is first rate. Both the black and white and color transfers in this set are clean and beautiful. Hollywood Cavalcade and The Great American Broadcast are wonderful nostalgic looks at early silent film (with actual stars of that time) and earliest days of radio, both made only a couple of decades later when memory of those early times was still fresh and so now appear semi-documentary. Alice Faye is showcased in all her versatility and singing talent in four of the five films in this collection. Four Jills in a Jeep has her as a brief guest only, but the film is a period piece of World War II and fits with the other films in this collection. A bargain price for such a collection.",1414368000,,748,4.507352941176471
3419530,5,B0018RKEQ4,"Why did I give the first Alice Faye box set four stars and this one five? No real reason. Maybe because there were four films in that set and five in this one (which seems like a better deal), or maybe because I like these somewhat better. Maybe they could both average out to four and a half. Once again, I give Leonard Maltin's views from his Classic Movie Guide (this is the edition I actually read, but there is a later, expanded edition)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leonard-Maltin-s-Classic-Movie-Guide/dp/0452286204/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide</a>, followed by my own impressions.
Rose of Washington Square. B&W, 1939. LM says, ""so-so musical"", and gives it two and a half stars. I sort of agree and sort of don't. LM has watched lots of musicals, but I never tire of them. This is a musical within a musical (as so many of these films tend to be), this one set in the '20s during Prohibition. Alice Faye is fantastic with Tyrone Power, and it's great to see William Frawley from I Love Lucy in this film.
Hollywood Cavalcade. B&W and color, 1939. ""Colorful film starts out fun"", says LM, giving it two and a half stars. Why B&W and color? Because the setting this time is 1913, the beginning of slapstick comedy (and the end of it). LM thinks the slapstick was well done. I didn't really, but then there's so much great stuff from Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and others of the silent era that can likely not be bettered.
The Great American Broadcast. B&W, 1941. LM says, ""Entertaining...bright cast"", giving it two and a half stars. My own view is that John Payne is fantastic, while Jack Oakie falls somewhat flat. But there are plenty of other acts that more than make up for it. Alice is the bombshell at the birth of radio, or rather of radio as a means of entertainment, but it's a very visual film.
Hello Frisco Hello. Color, 1943. LM did not like this film, calling it ""a hackneyed musicomedy...a big comedown from earlier musicals for this trio,"" and gave it two stars. Perhaps so, but I liked it immensely. John Payne and Alice Faye are once again amazing together. What more do you need? The setting this time is the gold rush, and it does sort of seem like a comic western. Similar ground was worked later by Disney in The Happiest Millionaire&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-4-Movie-Collection-Classics-Gnome-Mobile-Darby-O-gill-Little-People-One-Only-Genuine-Family-Happiest-Millionaire/dp/B008H6GHJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney 4-Movie Collection: Classics (Gnome-Mobile / Darby O'gill & Little People / One & Only Genuine Family / Happiest Millionaire)</a>.
Four Jills in a Jeep. B&W, 1944. LM gives it two and a half stars and says, ""some good musical moments"".

3419533,5,B0018RKEQ4,"Alice Faye (born Alice Jeanne Leppert, May 5, 1915 - May 9, 1998) was one of the best singing actresses ever. She could make any tune sound sublime with her sophisticated phrasing, excellent diction and her keen sense of timing. The films boast excellent choreography, cinematography, song and dance numbers galore and convincing acting by Alice and the rest.  There films in this box set are Rose of Washington Square; Hollywood Cavalcade; The Great American Broadcast; Hello, Frisco Hello and Four Jills in a Jeep.

Rose of Washington Square features great singing, dancing and acting. Rose Sargent (Alice Faye) works in vaudeville clubs and speakeasies with her friend and showbiz partner Ted Cotter (Al Jolson). During a trip to the countryside, Rose falls for ""Bart"" Barton DeWitt Clinton (Tyrone Power). Rose sees Bart goes against the law but sticks by him.  Bart's business goes against what Rose's showbiz partner Ted Cotter believes in; Ted tells Rose to stay away from Bart while detective Mike Cavanaugh (Charles C. Wilson) trails Bart. Rose is also noticed by agents for Florenz Ziegfeld when she sings at a party to honor Ted's achievements in the theater. Rose joins Ziegfeld's Follies as a star!

Alice Faye sings beautifully including a sublime rendition of ""My Man"" and Al Jolson performs several of his classic numbers, although I wish he hadn't done them in blackface. The DVD comes with a captivating featurette on Alice Faye, a restoration comparison and more.

As for Hollywood Cavalcade, Alice Faye doesn't sing a note but gets her chance to shine doing comedy and drama; the others did a fine job, too! The plot moves along well and everything combines to make the film memorable.

In 1913, prop-boy Michael Linnett Connors (Don Ameche) notices a fine understudy actress Molly Adair (Alice Faye) on Broadway in New York. Molly signs a contract to be Michael's newest star--and goes with him to California to make films. After the shock that Michael is only a prop-boy, Molly settles into her work and Michael loves working; Michael directs Molly in a film where by accident she gets a pie in the face! Spectators watching filming laugh when Molly gets that pie in the face--and Michael gets the idea to do it over and over again in films much to Molly's chagrin.

Molly loves Michael; but Michael is about the work. Molly works hard but eventually marries her leading man, Nicky Hayden (Alan Curtis). Michael then finally admits he loves Molly--then he fires Molly (and Nicky) even though she's his biggest asset and he could be financially ruined as a direct result of this! The rest of the film shows how everything plays out. I also liked the silent film footage in black and white to make things realistic.
As for bonus features, I particularly enjoyed ""Hollywood Cavalcade: The Silent Dream Featurette"" and ""The Hollywood Cavalcade Premiere.""

The Great American Broadcast is another stunner! Jack Oakie, The Ink Spots and others perform excellent numbers. The plot moves along well. The sets, choreography and cinematography all enhance the film, too.

Rix Martin (John Payne) fights with telephone line workers including Chuck Hadley (Jack Oakie) when they hang wires over Rix's airfield even though his airplane ride business is all washed up. Nevertheless, Chuck takes Rix back to his place to warm up after a rainstorm and Rix meets Chuck's ""girlfriend,"" Vicki Adams (Alice Faye). Chuck is a pioneer in radio and although Rix thinks it's unusual he admits Chuck's idea is interesting. With financial help from Rix's World War One buddy Bruce (Cesar Romero), Chuck, Rix and Vicki do a local broadcast and although the weather nearly ruins everything it's clear that Chuck and his friends are on to something.

Rix gets ideas to improve radio signals so that many, many people can hear a live performance! Rix does a live broadcast of the Willard-Dempsey fight--and that changes things for radio as well as Rix, Vicki and Chuck--even Bruce! But competition turns old friends into fierce competitors; everybody else wants into the act, too. Rix's radio station is almost broke and when Vicki goes to Bruce privately for a loan this sets off a chain of unexpected events.

Look also for a wonderful sequence featuring the Nicholas Brothers who could dance better than just about anyone and The Ink Spots shine. Charles Fuqua performs a ""song specialty;"" and The Wiere Brothers give a great performance.

The DVD also comes with extras including ""Radio Waves: The Real History of The Great American Broadcast"" and a restoration comparison.

Hello, Frisco Hello is another strong Fox musical featuring Alice Faye; she sings many numbers and she never lets go of a superfluous note! The acting was very convincing; the sets were well done with great thought given to detail. Again, the choreography and cinematography shine and the background musical score enhances the film.

Johnny Cornell (John Payne) and his fine troupe of Trudy Evans (Alice Faye), Dan Daley (Jack Oakie) and Beulah Clancy (June Havoc) entertain the crowd in a nightspot run by Sharkey (Ward Bond) who fires them after Johnny tries a routine that wows the crowd so much they leave the bar and become fixated by the act! Johnny gets the idea for them to perform on the streets for a charitable mission using their license--and Johnny gets lots of money from owners of saloons and nightclubs to stay away so they don't lose business to Johnny and his troupe! Johnny, Trudy, Dan and Beulah climb the ladder; Johnny has his own theaters and they put on their own shows.

There's a kinda-sorta romance between Johnny and Trudy that ambles along until wealthy heiress Bernice Croft (Lynn Bari) and her pals enter one of Johnny's nightspots--and Johnny has a thing for her. Bernice gets her selfish paws all over Johnny who doesn't exactly mind even though he knows in the back of his head that Trudy is hurt by this. Trudy gravitates toward Bernice's friend Ned Clark (John Archer) and Bernice slowly but surely attracts Johnny to the point where he wants to help Bernice after Bernice loses everything! Johnny ultimately spurns Trudy altogether and he even marries Bernice partly so she can set him up in the ritzy world of San Francisco's Nob Hill with opera and ""society;"" but this sets off a chain of unexpected events.

The DVD comes with bonus features including ""Hello Again: The Remaking of Alice Faye"" featurette and the restoration comparison.

Four Jills in a Jeep tells the true story of how some of America's most talented Hollywood stars risked life and limb to go overseas during World War Two and entertain the troops. This musical film is very well done and it works extremely well as a musical. The acting is extremely convincing and the excellent musical numbers came at me fast and furious!

When the action starts, we see a ""command performance"" radio show being broadcast live to the fighting men overseas. Betty Grable (as herself) sings very well and Kay Francis (also as herself) really shines as the MC for the event. Jimmy Dorsey & His Orchestra perform wonderfully, too. We also meet the most talented Martha Raye, Carol Landis Mitzi Mayfair, all of whom play themselves.

Mitzi, Martha and Carol all dream of going overseas to perform in person for the troops; and soon their leader Kay Francis tells them that they are going! Once there, they are met by their escort Eddie (Phil Silvers, thrown in for some comic relief) and they perform in various places including London and North Africa rather close to the front.

We see Carol falling in love with Ted Warren (John Harvey); and Mitzi has a mixed result when she accidentally bumps into her old show business partner Lt. Dick Ryan (Dick Haymes).

The plot can go anywhere from here--and I'm not about to spoil it for you! Look also for good, solid performances by Carmen Miranda and Alice Faye (who also appear as themselves) and George Jessel plays himself as the MC of another ""command performance"" radio show while the ladies are overseas.

The DVD comes with deleted scenes, a restoration comparison, an optional isolated score track and another featurette entitled ""The Real Four Jills.""

Overall, The Alice Faye Collection, Volume 2 is a blockbuster package for Alice Faye fans, people who appreciate classic movie musicals with superlative acting and storylines of classic romantic comedies with drama often added for a great and memorable effect.",1373155200,2,8431,4.951167728237792

3419536,5,B0018RKEQ4,"This second volume of ALICE FAYE films is a welcome addition to the first volume and together, with all of the varying roles she played, display the reason for her popularity.

ROSE OF WASHINGTON SQUARE is one of Alice Faye's most memorable and entertaining films.  She sings effectively many great standards plus a beautiful new ballad written for the picture.  Fannie Brice sued the studio and stars because it was obvious to her that some of the songs and the romantic interest presented in the film struck alarmingly close to home.  The studio, after much publicity, settled out of court.  Al Jolson fans will be pleased that he is prominently featured in this film and sings many of his big hits.  Tyrone Power plays a cad, but a charming one, and he and Alice Faye once again display their intense on-screen chemistry.  The film's transfer to DVD is clean and the sound is fine.

HOLLYWOOD CAVALCADE is a delightful depiction of early Hollywood from the silents to the talkies.  After being discovered by Don Ameche in a stage production, Alice Faye is persuaded to accompany him to Hollywood to star under his direction in silent films.  Among the silent film luminaries you will see are Buster Keaton, Mack Sennett, Ben Turpin, Chester Conklin, and the Keystone Kops.  Alice seems right at home and proves that she would have been a delectable silent film star.  The last half of the film shifts emphasis once talkies become all the rage.  Don ignores Alice, so her attention is drawn to handsome leading man Alan Curtis, and they eventually marry.  They become top stars as Don's fortunes are fading.  Many problems ensue, but everything eventually works out.  A thoroughly engrossing look at early Hollywood.  Although Alice doesn't sing a note, she gives a sterling performance along with her co-star Don Ameche.  The color is beautiful and clear, and we could find no problem with the sound.

THE GREAT AMERICAN BROADCAST is a fictional account of the invention of radio with some facts thrown in.  This is a thoroughly entertaining film containing some of Alice Faye's best singing and fine performances from all of the principals.  Many of the entertainment world's best specialty acts appear, including the Nicholas Brothers, the Four Ink Spots, and the Wiere Brothers.  Alice's beautiful rendering of the haunting Where You Are with the Four Ink Spots is a gem.  The insertion of the actual newsreel footage of the Willard-Dempsey fight in the regular footage of the film is expertly accomplished.  The transfer to DVD is crisp an clear, and the sound is good.

HELLO, FRISCO, HELLO was the vehicle chosen to return Alice Faye to the screen after the birth of her first daughter.  Her studio and fans were eager for her return.  Dressed in beautiful period costumes, Alice is stunning, with a tiny waist never seen in her previous pictures.  She sings ten songs, including a heartfelt You'll Never Know, a song which took the country by storm and won the Academy Award.  John Payne plays an unsympathetic role but acquits himself well.  Jack Oakie, June Havoc, Lynn Bari, and Laird Cregar are all first-rate.  The story is an incidental one about love lost and regained, but it is a fast-paced, beautiful movie both to the eyes and ears, with opulent sets and outstanding musical numbers.  The color in this transfer is vivid and the sound is crisp and clear.  (Note:  We must register our disappointment that the theatrical trailer used in this package is in black and white.)

FOUR JILLS IN A JEEP brings to film the adventures of four actresses who entertained the troops during World War 2.  Kay Francis, Carole Landis, Martha Raye, and Mitzi Mayfair all appear as themselves and are all splendid, especially Martha Raye, who is always delightful to watch.  Dick Haymes is introduced in this film, and he seems very relaxed in front of the camera and sings beautifully.  Fox evidently decided to bolster the box-office appeal of the picture by including cameo appearances by three of its top female stars:  Alice Faye, Betty Grable, and  Carmen Miranda.  Betty sings Cuddle Up A Little Closer, Carmen sings I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi, I Like You Very Much, while Alice sings her signature song You'll Never Know, which was so popular during the war years.  The film has been transferred with pristine results both in picture and sound.",1251849600,2,4346,4.857142857142857

3419556,5,B0018RKEQ4,"I didn't know until this set arrived that ""Rose of Washington Square"" had Al Jolson singing his greatest songs. I was bowled over. Having been brought up, so to speak, with Larry Park's fine work in ""The Al Jolson Story,"" I knew exactly how Jolson sounds (Park's singing was lip-synched with Jolson recordings)and had some idea of the way he presented his songs. Some idea? To see Jolson doing his great songs in this film is a revelation. It makes the price of the entire set of films seem ridiculously low.

Jolson was considered the greatest entertainer of his era. I can now see why. Usually he stood still and kept his gestures to a minimum. But when he sings ""Toot Toot Tootsie"" he does an absolutely amazing, twisting tap dance in a style that's all his own, and all this while singing. Jolson is mesmerizing. His songs are presented the way he sang them, solo on the stage with no one else present. No dancers; they would have been superfluous because your eyes are on Jolson.

He performed in blackface. This today is very politically incorrect. Indeed, even in the 50s, when Larry Park did his great Jolson imitations, he only used blackface once, in the minstrel number ""Rosie."" (You eremember, ""Rosie, You are my posie."") So I had no idea that Jolson performed in blackface all the time! I was an organizer for civil liberties in 1959, four years before Martin Luther King made his historic speech in Washington. So I have nothing to apologize for if I say that, in the 1920s and 1930s, music performed by blacks was taken out of the small clubs and put on the silver screen by Hollywood in one of the greatest cultural initiatives for racial equality that this country has ever known. (Remember how Harpo Marx went into a black shanty town and played a love song to the kids on his harp?) To be sure, Jolson used blackface because it increased the production values of his act. But he wouldn't have dared do it if it chased away patrons. The fact was that theatre goers were in no position to complain; they were totally entranced by Jolson's performances.

And now we can see them. Those that were cut out of ""Rose of Washington Square"" FORTUNATELY were included in the Extras. Larry Park didn't do ""April Showers"" or ""Avalon,"" two of Jolson's most famous, but Al himself did them on the cutting-room floor along with this movie.

As for the rest of the set, it's all lagniappe. YOu can see a very young Don Ameche showing off his great talent in ""Hollywood Calvacade."" And then there is the star of the set, Alice Faye. I'm not one of her true fans; I go for the opposite type in female singers, say the peerless Arlene Dahl (knocking you out in ""Three Little Words"" (1950)).  But Ms. Faye has a fabulous range; she can hit those contralto notes as good as, well, as good as Dorothy Lamour. She's a great actress, always in character. Tyrone Power, the mugger, wasn't so hot as Nick Arnstein (the story was based on Fanny Brice).

Al Jolson wasn't a very nice guy off-stage, though this movie makes him seem like a prince in real life. But look at the recent revelations about John Lennon. You have to take these performers for what they did on stage, no more, no less. (With the exception of Debbie Reynolds, a sweetheart on and off-stage.)",1225670400,5,3256,4.557264957264957
3419557,4,B0018RKEQ4,"A Hollywood star of the 1930s and '40s, blonde, button-nosed Alice Faye had a sort of plain-jane, girl-next-door appeal. She was a demure singer with a cheerful onscreen presence, and starred in numerous mid-level musicals, often surrounded by a large ensemble cast and numerous guest performers.  This is the second set of DVD reissues of her work at the 20th Century Fox studios, and includes a few frothy films from the early wartime years of WWII.  It's pleasant, highly formulaic material from an earlier, innocent era. The films include:

""Rose of Washington Square"" (1939)  A rags-to-riches showbiz pic with Faye starring as a struggling vaudeville star, co-starring old-timer Al Jolson and matinee idol Tyrone Power.

""Hollywood Cavalcade"" (1939) a showbiz comedy with co-star Don Ameche. Pretty, richly colored cinematography compensates somewhat for the by-the-numbers B-movie script.

""The Great American Broadcast"" (1941) is a highlight of this set.  This frothy, energetic comedy is a loose-with-the-facts fictionalization of how radio became the great American medium of the early 20th Century. Robust, good-natured John Payne (sort of the Brendan Fraser of his time) and comic sidekick Jack Oakie meet up around 1920 as two down-and-out World War One vets who share an interest in the then-new radio technology. Payne's character come up with the idea that maybe they could use this newfangled radio stuff to bring entertainment to people all across the country... and then they're off! Of course, there's gotta be a girl, too and enter the ever-blonde girl next door, Alice Faye, as the gal they both love. But it ain't a love triangle -- nope! -- it's a square, because rich-cad tycoon Cesar Romero wants her too. This is a pleasantly fast-paced, lighthearted film, packed with better-than-usual performances from Ms. Faye (she and Payne duet quite nicely together). There are also great cameos from the Ink Spots vocal group, a fabulous (but all-too-brief) dance number from the Nicolas Brothers, and a nice, dewy-eyed version of how radio came to America. It's a fun old film... they really don't make 'em like this anymore!

""Hello Frisco Hello"" (1943) reunites the Faye, Payne and Jack Oakie as yet another trio of star-crossed entertainers who brave the odds and wind up on top -- only to lose everything when fate turns against them. This time they're song-and-dance vaudevillers working in San Francisco's rough-and-tumble Barbary Coast.  Payne plays a talented showman who builds an entertainment empire, only to lose everything when he marries the wrong woman -- a hoity-toity high-society dame with expensive tastes who dumps him once times get hard. Waiting in the wings is loyal Alice Faye, who the big lug should have married in the first place.  Their buddy Jack is there to make sure things work out right.  The musical numbers tend to be raucous, Dixieland-tinged floorstompers, although there's some nice barbershop singing, and Faye croons one of her best-known ballads, ""You'll Never Know.""

""Four Jills in a Jeep"" (1944) is a star-studded, flimsily plotted showbiz revue set around the wartime USO circuit.  There are several stars of yesteryear in here, including Dick Haymes, Carmen Miranda, Betty Grable, Jimmy Dorsey and his band, as well as Alice Faye, singing ""You'll Never Know,"" which had become her signature song. This isn't actually an Alice Faye film, but it's still a nice slice of good, old-fashioned, B-grade Hollywood hokum -- the she's-so-obnoxious schtick with Marth Raye may wear thin, but it's still a pleasantly formulaic film.

All in all, this is a nice set of old-fashioned Hollywood corn... If you like movies from a more innocent time when the only goal in films was simply to entertain, this collection has some swell stuff to offer.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1225238400,5,3834,5.181229773462783
3419558,4,B0018RKEQ4,"As a few others have mentioned, the inclusion of ""Four Jills in a Jeep"" is totally a misfire in this collection due to Alice Faye's 5 minute appearance. Why wasn't ""Tin Pan Alley"" included? That film was a huge hit in 1940 - and has Betty Grable! Or how about ""In Little Old New York"" with Fred MacMurray? I also want to mention that 3 out of the 5 films are available on VHS. The two that have never been available are: The Great American Broadcast and Hollywood Cavalcade. I have had bad ""taped from TV"" videos of these two films for years simply because they were never available commercially. One can only hope that by not including some of her never released to video films from the 1930s, that the big scheme (future volumes) will include some of those. I should also mention that ""Hollywood Cavalcade"" has no musical numbers.",1210809600,12,832,4.516556291390729
