ALL OR NOTHING

I am really hyped up about this upcoming Penn vs Pierre 2 bout coming this weekend at UFC 94 so I had to get some MMA out of my system early, so I grabbed the first UFC DVD I noticed in the collection when I walked in the room. This was a pretty historical event for the UFC seeing that Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson and Mirko Cro Cop both debuted at this event, I love it.

1. DUSTIN HAZELETT VS DIEGO SARAIVA-things start out with a bang with a nice kick to the head as they both just go for broke even on the ground. Hazelett pulls a nice rubber guard, and they still go at through out the first round. The ref stands the two up even though Hazelett had nice leg lock on, but Haz sends Diego back to the ground and pounds. The second round looks just like the first with some good action and some good punches thrown, this is a good fight even though the ref stands them up early. The third looks much like the first two with the ref standing them up way to early, but Hazelett takes a unanimous decision win. 4/5

2. LYOTO MACHIDA VS SAM HOGER-this pit one undefeated fighter against a veteran of the first Ultimate Fighter. We get an excellent first round with both throwing some nice shots with Sam even getting dropped at one point, either on the ground on standing both go at it with some good offense. Sam gets taken down a couple of times in this round but always finds his way out, great first round. The second round looks like the first but with Lyoto coming out on top even more, taking Sam down and knocking him down he also lands some nice leg kicks. The third round looks like the second but with Lyoto looking more dominant then the last time, after some nice exchanges with the hands some good leg kicks and take downs Lyoto takes a win by decision. 4.5/5

3. TYSON GRIFFEN VS FRANK EDGAR-excellent first round between these two as they battle it out to what looks like they would go to the death. Both throw vicious looking blows and take downs, they just go at it. The second round is just as exciting and explosive as the first with Edgar almost losing to a nice uppercut. They both go at it with everything that they have throwing nice blows hitting good take downs and the transitions and reversals are amazing in this fight. The third round is just as great as the first two with a very suspenseful ending were it looked as if Tyson was going to win with a vicious leg lock. But Frank holds on and takes the win via decision from the judges. 5/5

4. JORGE RIVERA VS TERRY MARTIN-this one ends quick as Martin catches a kick from Rivera and knocks him out with a hard right. He follows up with a few more rights but is stopped by the ref, 14 seconds long this one is. 5/5

5. SCOTT SMITH VS PATRICK COTE-two friends from The Ultimate Fighter 4 season match up in this one, I like both of these guys so it was hard to cheer for one or the other when this event took place. The first round is great with some great leg kicks giving between the two and some nice exchanges. At one point Cote slams Smith pretty hard but Scott finds his way back up. Another great round with some great exchanges with one point in the round Smith gets rocked, they also exchange a couple of posses. I do not know why the so-called fans boo, I hate fickle fans. Smith comes out guns blazing at the beginning of the third and still the UFC fans boo [UFC fans is a term I use for fickle fans, real fans are MMA fans]. These two show great foot work and movement in this fight, great defensive maneuvering. I hate that these people are booing at the end of this fight, it makes me sick. Cote gets the win after all the judges give it to him, to me this is a great fight. 4.5/5

6. QUINTON ""RAMPAGE"" JACKSON VS MARVIN EASTMAN-this is a rematch between these two after Marvin beat Rampage at a King of the Cage event earlier in their careers. Marvin and Rampage have always been very entertaining and Rampage has always been a favorite of mine from King of the Cage and especially Pride FC. These two waste no time going at it exchanging blows and tie ups, the first round is full of this and has a nice end to the round. The second round looks much like the first with a little less action but man does it heat up at the end, Rampage knocks out Marvin with some sick uppercuts. 4/5

7. ROGER HUERTA VS JOHN HALVERSON-this one ends really quickly as Roger takes John down and gets his back after an illegal knee. But Roger just keeps laying in to him as he takes his back and the win, still a pretty good fight to bad it ends in controversy. Still I believe him when he says he hit the guy in the shoulder, so I think it was a clean win. 4/5

8. MIRKO CRO COP VS EDDIE SANCHEZ-now I don't get all the complaining every one is doing about this fight, saying this was a easy fight for Mirko. Any one who actually participates in this sport will tell you that there is no such thing as an easy fight. Everyone who fights is dangerous and Eddie is a very good fighter, how would he be in the UFC if he wasn't. Mirko has never backed out of any fight regardless of his opponent and I would say that Eddie has the same thinking on that subject. The first and only round was a good one as Mirko controlled everything really but Eddie did exchange with him some. I think he could have done much better but I think he was too intimidated. Cro Cop wins after a nice TKO victory, Pride FC in the house baby. 4/5

9. ANDERSON SILVA VS TRAVIS LUTTER-Lutter had won the Ultimate Fighter 4 in his weight class and earned a title shot against Silva, but after some personal problems he could not make weight. So the title fight turned into a non-title fight just like that and here we go. For some reason every one was surprised when not only did Lutter take Silva down multiple times but controlled most of the round and even mounted Silva towards the end. But after a failed arm-bar attempt Silva gets up and the round ends. The second round starts with Lutter taking Silva down again but he gets stuck in a triangle. Still he holds on for a very long time but once Silva throws them elbows Travis taps out after a very good showing. 4/5

This was a pretty good event that I think is much better than people give it credit for, sure it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst ever. There is a nice behind the scenes feature that I think everyone would enjoy, some nice stuff is shown on here with Rampage and Mirko that you may want to see.",1233273600,,6442,4.195476575121163
8181586,5,B000NVIGMU,"I wasn't disapointed with any of the fights on the main card. Three stoppages,one conterversy,and one decision in which both fighters won one round. In the prelims you've got the fight of the night and the debut of a future star. Plus,you get behind the scenes of Cro-Cop,Sanchez,Jackson,and Eastman!",1211760000,,300,5.142857142857143
8181587,4,B000NVIGMU,"This UFC event had some of the wind taken out of it's sails before the event even took place when supposed title contender, Travis Lutter, failed to make weight for his one and only shot at the UFC Middleweight belt.  I can't comprehend how a B-level fighter like Lutter could let this happen.  He claimed that he ""really hard time getting motivated"" to lose the weight.  Wow.

Anyway, the televised fight card begins with Patrick Cote, whom I was not too excited to see in action again after going 0-4 in his ""staying past your welcome"" UFC career. He takes on Scott Smith in a snoozer.  I would rather have seen Lyoto Machida televised, as he is a fighter that can certainly make waves in the UFC.

Next, it's the highly anticipated debut of former Pride Fighting superstar Quinton Rampage Jackson. He gets a second shot at Marvin ""The Beastman"" Eastman, the man who long ago handed him his first professional loss at a King of the Cage event.  Jackson uses this fight to shake off some rust and get used to the bright lights of the Las Vegas-based UFC promotion.  The fight is worth watching, although Rampage seems a bit tentative for the most part.

Rising star, Roger ""El Matador"" Huerta then squares off against John Halverson. I am not all that familiar with Halverson, but it doesn't really matter much in this fight.

Mirko ""Cro Cop"" Filipovic also makes his highly anticipated UFC debut on this night. He takes on relative MMA newcomer, Eddie Sanchez, in this bout. Sanchez is a hard puncher, but there isn't all that much else to speak of in terms of his accolades or skills. Cro Cop comes from Pride Fighting with a strong reputation as one of the top two heavyweight fighters in the world. There is much pressure on Cro Cop to make a huge statement with this fight. It turns out to be a good debut for Mirko, although he is not yet truly tested here.

Next up: the main event between Anderson ""The Spider"" Silva and Travis Lutter. This is not a title bout, as Lutter fails to make weight, but we will have to sit through the last fight of his UFC career anyway. Lutter actually fights a good fight, for the most part. I would say, however, that I don't see anyone legitimately challenging Silva at middleweight for quite some time.  He is clearly the best this division has to offer right now.

Overall, this was a decent night of fights.  I was excited to see Rampage and Cro Cop make their way to the UFC, finally. Hopefully, this will spice things up in the Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight divisions.",1193097600,3,2519,4.532008830022075
8181588,4,B000NVIGMU,"Decent fight card. The reason I bought this is because of Rampage & Cro-Cops debuts in the UFC. Everybody knows these 2 guys are at the top of their divisions, and are friends. Rampage & Cro-Cop have some incredible memories when they fought in Pride. Unforgettable. I gave this a 4 star rating instead of 5 for 1 reason...you'll figure it out!",1186012800,4,344,4.564516129032258
8181589,2,B000NVIGMU,"You might be looking at the card and thinking (wow this is pretty sweet maybe I should buy it or Netflix it) But I'd advise against it. As neat as it is that the PPV features the UFC debuts of Rampage and CroCop, neither fight is entertaining. Quinton's was especially disappointing as the first round was seen by many as rather boring. Before the finish actually it all was pretty unentertaining. In CroCop's case, he was booked purposefully against a less skilled fighter to get him over with the audience unfamiliar with him. Well he destroys the guy, but it's not as fun as some of his other one sided beat downs.

For the rest of the card, Lyoto and Cote both have boring fights while the main event is decided in a non-title fight with a contender who's overweight and already gassed. Though it is interesting how close he is to finishing Silva. His exhaustion point cost him dearly though. Skip this one.",1185753600,5,911,4.554878048780488
8181590,4,B000NVIGMU,"Yep, I said it. And I could care less what anybody thinks. This is ""All or Nothing,"" people. And for some, all or nothing is in a disappointing fashion. But wait!! Who do we have joining us who used to be ""pride fighters?"" Why, we have Mirko Cro Cop, and we have Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson. And we have Anderson Silva taking on Travis Lutter, and that's our main event of the night. Silva was supposed to be defending his title for the first time. Lutter didn't make weight, so it goes from a 5 round title fight to a 3 round fight. That's very disappointing. But what can you do? Lutter still won in TUF 4 over Patrick Cote. And in the first round! He's an amazing competitor. This simply could've been better prepared for.

The UFC uses a new intro. Still has the warrior suiting up for battle, but a little different this time. I liked it. And 3 fights would be featured in this intro. First was Eddie Sanchez, who would be Mirko Cro Cop's first opponent in the UFC. Sanchez came into this undefeated. But nobody DOESN'T know the name Cro Cop. Sanchez would say, ""The name Cro Cop? You know, goes in one ear and out the other. It's not really what I'm thinking about. What I'm thinking about is going in there against a really good southpaw kickboxer. And I'm gonna take it to him."" REALLY? Cro Cop's take? ""I watched a few of his fights. He's a good fighter. But I don't think he can surprise me."" WELL, OK! So who will Rampage Jackson be taking on? He'll be fighting Marvin ""The Beastman"" (ok!) Eastman. Eastman appears more then ready, and says, ""I will fight with anybody! King Kong, whoever! Godzilla, I will get down, and I will sling these things. I will put him down."" Hey, you don't believe me? Watch the intro! But I personally loved Rampage's attitude about his first Octagon experience against Marvin Eastman. ""You guys want to watch one of the best fights you've ever seen, watch this scrap. I'm 'bout to throw down! And then last, and unfortunately, least, is Lutter against Silva. I really wish Lutter would've made weight. He even said it was because of lack of motivation, but there is still the intro. Silva normally talks through his translator. Here's what he had to say. ""First of all, he's got to get me to the ground. And once he gets me to the ground, we're going to see if he's going to be able to finish me."" Lutter is pretty confident as well, and he gives Silva the credit he deserves, ""I think he's an amazing stand-up fighter. But, if I put him on his butt, that doesn't do him a damn bit of good."" Well, despite that disappointment, there are some damn good fights, along with a few questionable moments. In saying that, here are the fights!

Dustin Hazelett vs. Diego Saraiva: It was told that Diego submitted a Gracie...YIKES!!! While on the other hand, Hazelett is 6'1"" and 155 in this lightweight bout, and no body fat on the boy either. It goes to a unanimous decision.

Lyoto Machida vs. Sam Hoger: Hoger either thinks EVERYTHING is funny, or he just likes to fight with a smile on his face just because Tim Sylvia is in his corner. But he's taking on an undefeated opponent who thinks this is no laughing matter. And it goes to a unanimous decision as well.

Tyson Griffin vs. Frank Edgar: Griffin is one tough little son-of-a-gun, and he's beaten some bad boys. But does Frank Edgar have ""The Answer"" for that equation? ANOTHER decision, once again unanimous.

Jorge Rivera vs. Terry Martin: Don't blink! 14 seconds?! You gotta be kidding me! Sorry, Tank Abbott, but that's a little more impressive than your debut in UFC 6! Very impressive.

Patrick Cote vs. Scott Smith: This fight should've been over in round 2. I think there is a difference between playing dumb and being dumb. Patrick Cote was just being dumb, quite frankly. But just because you're dumb doesn't mean you can't win the decision.

Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson vs. Marvin Eastman: I call this the sad, but continuing saga of Marvin Eastman in the UFC. No, he's never lost to chumps in his previous 2 fights, but the story is the same. Looks tough, paces the ring with this tough look...KA-BOOM!!! The sucker gets floored and the fight gets stopped. An interesting foot-note about this, though. Eastman had previously beat Jackson 6 years prior. Eastman is no can, but he's never been one of my favorites.

Roger Huerta vs. John Halverson: Really quick win, but in controversial fashion. I don't know. Congratulations to the winner? See you next fight!

Mirko ""Cro Cop"" Filipovic vs. Eddie Sanchez: Hmm. Imagine Nolan Ryan going down to Howard J. Lamade Stadium to pitch his best in the Little League World Series. To me, that's what this fight was equivalent to. Quite frankly, I'm not taking anything away from Eddie Sanchez. He took a fight against Mario Neto in UFC 63 on 2 days notice, and knocked him out in a decisive manner in round 2! But this was really not much of a fight. This was Cro Cop he was taking on. I think it did go longer than anybody expected. WELCOME MIRKO CRO COP TO THE UFC!!

Travis Lutter vs. Anderson Silva: Despite the hype, this was no main event. It was a decent fight, and it ended in the 2nd round. Unfortunately, in a negative kind of sense, it certainly defines, ""All or Nothing."" Lutter looks dejected coming into the Octagon. Hopefully he learned a lesson.

I'd simply say don't let the Hems and Haws of this deter you from enjoying it. Sucky, crappy, poopy? NAH! Just a little let down is all. Some great surprises in some parts. Hey, get the snacks ready! Welcome 2 newcomers to the UFC, and cheer them on!! Now, with all that went into this, you look me in the eye and tell me something. WHAT IS PRIDE?!!?! That's what I thought!",1182902400,5,5679,4.5199610516066215
