6199383,5,B00HR2ZJ8M,"My son is hooked on Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. The quality of this DVD is quite good. Now my three year old son says, ""I said good day, sir!"" in his very best Gene Wilder voice every chance he gets.

Love it!",1426291200,2,218,3.9545454545454546
6199384,4,B00HR2ZJ8M,"The color quality and photography used in Hugo is collector quality, not to mention that it's an excellent story.  Ben Kingsley's performance is wonderful as well.",1424649600,,163,5.269230769230769

6199386,5,B00HR2ZJ8M,"Willy Wonka is one of my all time favorite movies and I was stunned by the difference watching it on Blu-Ray.  The clarity is amazing.  Despite the fact I must have seen the movie 20 times, it was like watching it for the first time again.  Hugo is also an excellent movie.",1402617600,3,273,4.211538461538462
6199387,5,B00HR2ZJ8M,I'm a Nana who loves children's movies and I have 5 grandchildren so I try to keep a good selection for them to chose from and I always watch them first.  I live both of these movies and I know they will too. It was a brand new movie with the cellophane still on it. Received earlier than I expected so I have no complaints with this seller.,1401494400,,341,4.014705882352941
6199388,5,B00HR2ZJ8M,"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a childhood fantasy classic based on a Roald Dahl book, telling the story of a boy named Charlie, winner of a Golden Ticket that entitles him to tour the Wonka Chocolate Factory with the owner and founder, Willy Wonka himself. The wonders and hazards of the candy factory are revealed by Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) to the five lucky ticket holders and their parents. Based on their reactions to these marvels, the children are sorted out by the wily Willy until he finds the one who will receive a magnificent gift. This film is an old favorite from 1971, and considered to be just a bit better than the 2005 re-make starring Johnny Depp, which was released with the original name from the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Hugo is a fictional story about an orphaned boy who lives (and hides) among the giant clocks at the Montparnasse Railway Station in Paris of the 1930s. Although the story is fiction, it is woven around a real person, Georges Melies, a magician who became one of the foremost innovators of the new medium of film in the 1890s. By the time of this story, however, he is a forgotten man, operating a small toy store in the railway station. In discovering Melies' history, Hugo learns of the beginning of the movies. And so, of course, do we. Directed by Martin Scorsese, and released in 2011, the tale is a well-told fantasy bordering on reality, and a visual delight.

A pair of fanciful Hollywood stories for one low price! But wait (as the TV pitchman would say) there's more! These enjoyable films are in Blu-ray so that you can catch every colorful detail. Seriously, Willy Wonka and Hugo are delightful, and if you don't already have one or both, a real value in this double-feature presentation. These two films, released 40 years apart, beautifully illustrate the magic of movies.",1400457600,5,1857,4.71076923076923
6199389,5,B00HR2ZJ8M,"These films are not only children's classics; adults find them enormously appealing, too. They are presented with the best possible Blu-ray image: the color and detail are gorgeous and the sound is perfectly crisp. This dazzling, delightful set is bargain-priced, costing less than $10 for two movies, and it's compact, fitting both discs into a slim case.

Extras on ""Hugo"" (2011) include about an hours' worth of short features: ""Shoot the Moon: The Making of Hugo"" (20 minutes), ""The Cinemagician, Georges Mlis"" (16 minutes), ""The Mechanical Man at the Heart of Hugo"" (13 minutes), ""Big Effects, Small Scale"" (6 minutes), and ""Sacha Baron Cohen: Role of a Lifetime"" (4 minutes). ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971) offers two standard-definition featurettes: ""Pure Imagination: The Story of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (30 minutes) and a vintage featurette (4 minutes), as well as four sing-along songs and full-length commentary by the now-grown Wonka Kids.

Through produced 40 years apart, both films are modern fairy tales with an abundance of heart. I could go on about the flamboyant fantasy that is ""Willy Wonka,"" based on Roald Dahl's book with music by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, or the masterful dream that Martin Scorsese conjures up in the sumptuously cinematic ""Hugo."" But you've probably already seen these movies and love them as much as I do, so I'll simply urge you to buy this box and be done with it.",1395532800,17,1453,5.100840336134453
6199390,5,B00HR2ZJ8M,"I stumbled across Hugo on Netflix a couple of months ago, and had to acquire the film for my collection.  Excellent story, impressive set design, and very capable acting.  Gene Wilder's Wonka, in the second film, is the definitive version.  Wonderful pairing for a great price.",1488758400,,277,4.978260869565218

6199396,3,B00HR2ZJ8M,Hugo is boring but Willy Wonka was the same price without it so I figured a free movie is better than none.,1484697600,,107,3.909090909090909
6199397,5,B00HR2ZJ8M,Great price for 2 fully loaded Blurays! Willy Wonka contains an excellent print with great audio plus commentary from the Wonka kids and a descent 30 minute documentary. Hugo is also full of great special features with nearly perfect picture and DD audio.,1483574400,2,255,4.953488372093023
6199398,3,B00HR2ZJ8M,"Hugo looks pretty good, not the best looking blu-ray from a modern film but good.

This version of Willy Wonka on the other hand is a disaster. All they have done is taken the remastered DVD version, stretched it to a wide screen aspect ratio and lopped off the bottom and the top of the screen to get it in a wide screen format. Will wait until they release a rescan/restored version.

Received as a gift. Hugo was on my wish list and the person who bough this for me got this combo set so I was like cool, free Blu-Ray upgrade for my Willy Wonka which was something I was hoping to do at some point in the future, but as bad as the Blu-Ray is, I am going to stick to using the DVD version since it's better all around.",1482710400,,720,4.063380281690141

8634641,5,B00HR2ZJ8M,"Love the Willy Wonka movie. It has always been a huge classic...  I bought this not only as a replacement for my scratched Willy Wonka, but also to check out a movie i have never heard of:  HUGO.  Hugo was a great movie!!  Very, very cool subject and the graphics were incredible! You should check it out....  Very very interesting movie.",1523836800,,338,4.475409836065574

8634644,5,B00HR2ZJ8M,"I mostly bought this collection for Willy Wonka because that's the movie I liked and wanted to watch on Blu-Ray, and for the most part doesn't suffer from the transfer. Both are pretty charming movies with a child protagonist exploring worlds that just seem magical -- Hugo does it with machines and silent movies and Willy Wonka does it with a candy factory.",1497312000,,359,4.714285714285714

""The Tim Burton Collection"", oddly enough, it came with a few more movies I wanted, a-n-d, five, other
movies--- two of which I'd NEVER seen. So, in a compact space, I have the original WILLY WONKA &
THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, and, the (less-entertaining) [Johnny Depp] re-make of "" CHARLIE AND
THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY "".",1497312000,,421,5.0285714285714285

8634648,5,B00HR2ZJ8M,"What's not to like?  I hadn't seen Willy Wonka in decades, and remembered only a few key scenes.  Now that I have a young son, this is a move we are able to sit down and enjoy together.  Hugo was a nice surprise - a really well done move, and I was surprised to find it was directed by Martin Scorsese.",1489968000,,302,3.918032786885246
