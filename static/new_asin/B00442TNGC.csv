2. The plot is literally peter bechleys book and script, just then names of the characters are different.",1489190400,,148,4.730769230769231
8415619,1,B00442TNGC,"When we're talking bad killer shark flicks, two titles always top the list: SHARK ATTACK 3 and Bruno Mattei's made-for-TV movie, CRUEL JAWS. CRUEL JAWS uses so much stolen footage and lifted dialog from other films that it can hardly be recognized as a unique film of its own. The characters and events resemble the original JAWS so much, in fact, that Peter Benchley was given a writing credit despite having no involvement in the production. Fans will note specific instances that have also been blatantly removed from JAWS 3 and THE LAST SHARK, the latter of which is used the most frequently throughout the film. Mattei butchers THE LAST SHARK, Italy's premiere sharksploitation flick, and re-edits nearly half the film into his own with all the precision of a hacksaw. Plagiarism aside, what does exist of Mattei's original footage consists only of the most awful and absurd acting ever to come out of international waters. It is unintentionally hilarious, and serves as a never-ending source of entertainment for B-movie fans. Whether we're looking at the piss-poor line deliveries or the sad attempts at rewriting Benchley's material, CRUEL JAWS is a cinematic abortion from start to finish, but it is so perfectly bad that it even exceeds SHARK ATTACK 3 in the race for worst shark film ever made.

8415620,5,B00442TNGC,"Finally, a movie titled ""JAWS 5"". This film is rip-off steeling footage from Jaws, Jaws 2, Jaws 3, The Last Shark, and Deep Blood. It also steals music from Star Wars and takes actual lines and events from the five movies it rips off. Being the Jaws freak that I am, I enjoyed this movie as much as all the others. The plot is interesting and Scott Silveria, Larry Zeince, and Richard Dew (A Hulk Hogan look alike) are great actors. If you want Jaws 5, get this one!",1304640000,,466,4.247191011235955
8415621,5,B00442TNGC,"If you haven't already guessed it,its a JAWS Rip Off by none other than BRUNO MATTEI (Credited as WILLIAM SNYDER).Many people criticize this movie a lot,but I actually enjoyed the film...especially the HOT babes in the film ;).Bruno Mattei obviously did not have a big enough budget for a shark so he went on to steal footage from JAWS 1 2 3,The Last Shark(Mostly from this film),and Joe D'amato's Deep Blood. The movie also lifts a part from the STAR WARS theme as I pointed out in the Title for my review.

The film is about a navy trained tiger shark(Shows a Great White throughout the whole film :P) that invades Hampton Bay. The Mayor and his friend Samuel Lewis do not want to close to beaches because the MOB is involved...DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUHHHHHHH.But the shark attacks the regatta and the mob is upset with Lewis and hire thugs to take care of it..Meanwhile,Sam also sent an EVICTION notice to Dag Sorenson(owner of Sea World and a HULK HOGAN Clone)and Gloria Lewis(Sam's daughter) is in love with Bob Sorenson(Dags son).The Lew-mister finds out due to a pain in the but Ronnie Lewis tells on his sister. Dag has no problem about it though. NO MORE DETAILS OR I WILL SPOIL IT FOR YA :P

In the film,there is a FARTING Shark. YES A FARTING SHARK!!!As one of the THUG members tries to shoot the shark,the shark farts and then goes underwater...HERE IS THE CLIP: [...]

The DVD has no BONUS MATERIALS but just a biography of Bruno Mattei's movies. There is only a 2.0 English track (Sounds very Muffled :( ) and a 5.1 Italian track (With the pitch raised higher)Now thats pretty cheap for a 5.1 track. There is only Italian Subtitles,no english though! The film has been re-masterd from the previous Japan VHS release.

So if you like JAWS,The Last Shark movie,or a guy who talks like a girl,Buy this movie!",1261958400,,1812,4.6006191950464395
