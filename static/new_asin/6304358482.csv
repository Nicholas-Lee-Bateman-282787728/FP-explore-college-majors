but as I graduated my collection to DVD's, I found that this great movie,
starring Michael Imperioli and Mira Sorvino, wasn't available on DVD!
That was around 2004/2005 when I made the switch...so what is the hold up?
This movie was a late night staple on HBO and Showtime back a few years ago,
and if you're lucky enough to catch it, then you'll see what a stellar
& underrated actor that Michael Imperioli truly is!
Even though he has played a drug addicted person before in other roles,
he found a way to bring a soul & depth to it that really draws you in
and makes you want to take his character's convoluted journey with him!
You're really pulling for him to get straight!--Stop lying to his loving and
long suffering wife, played admirably by Mira Sorvino, who keeps hanging on to
the hope that her man isn't a total scum bag, though he is destroying her hope daily.
I don't want to spoil the other details for you if you haven't seen it, but this is
some good work and well worth adding to your collection when it finally comes to DVD!",1248652800,,1101,4.323671497584541

7868309,5,6304358482,"I caught this movie on cable one night and instantly wanted to own it. It's a fantastic movie that is incredibly dynamic in nature. There is the struggle to hold a family together, economic pressures that lead a man to crime, and the descent into madness at the hands of a crack pipe.

Michael Imperioli and Mira Sorvino both give amazing performances. This true story about a man named Angel (Angelo) was written in a diary that was found in an empty apartment in New York.

Years after seeing this, it remains one of my favorites. I cannot help but wonder why such an amazing movie was never released on DVD.",1196294400,,610,4.486486486486487

More powerful than any lecture or discussion could ever dream of being, this film shows so clearly what crack addiction is like. This movie should be shown to every high school senior.",978048000,3,250,4.456521739130435
