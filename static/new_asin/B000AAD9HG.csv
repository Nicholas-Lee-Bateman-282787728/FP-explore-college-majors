8204331,1,B000AAD9HG,"I am sure it is a fabulous DVD because Ernst was a fabulous artist, but, I was very disappointed because the disk is configured for European players and is therefore useless to me because I need to refer to the DVD not just watch it a few times on a computer with an overseas code (at which time it can't be played further).  There should be a warning concerning this additional obstacle in the way and the lack of commonality of components around the world, and international common usage is just not there. To repeat: this was a very disappointing purchase and the return of same between time and money is just not worth the bother.",1420416000,,634,4.4655172413793105
