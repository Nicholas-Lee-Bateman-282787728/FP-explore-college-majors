7814354,5,6301744144,"Once again we leap forward 100 years more, and Blackadder is now butler
to the feeble-minded Prince of Wales (a terrifically funny Hugh
Laurie), the son of the mad King George III.

This is the funniest of all the series, with Laurie's contribution
pushing the show up to a higher level.

There are still a few dull spots, and not every episode is brilliant,
but this does somehow combine almost Monty Python/Fawlty Towers type
genius into a period sit-com.

Atkinson as Blackadder continues to evolve, less dashing and handsome
here than in series 2, but more enjoyably (and understandably) angry
and frustrated at his situation in life, serving a man with a tiny
brain. There's also more physical humor in this season, and it's pulled
off very well indeed.",1347494400,,758,4.8604651162790695
7814355,5,6301744144,"I am such a fan of the whole Black Adder series, I honestly feel Rowan Atkinsons amazing comic ability is wasted on the painfully overdone, over-rated Mr Bean bandwagon.  Here you see him at his very dry best, with  Hugh Laurie being so fantastically stupid as the Prince Regent.  The reason  I decided to review this video is because it contains probably my favourite  episode, sense and senility, with the Prince absorbed with his new thesbian  friends, Edmund is at his razor sharp best, watch out for the great  sarcastic scene in Mrs Miggins pie shop.  The remaining two episodes on the  tape are just as entertaining, with there being a familiar face from Black  Adder II appearing in Amy and Amiability, for those amongest you who  apprieciate a bit of violence Dual and Duality is up your ally with a  suprising but hilairious ending.  As with any video from the entire Black  Adder series, you can't go wrong and you won't be dissapointed, ENJOY!",952560000,5,955,4.709090909090909
7814356,5,6301744144,"This video, along with the first video of series III, the second video of series II, and the first two episodes of the second video of series IV, contain the best of Blackadder.  But of all the Blackadder videos, this one  is consistently the best.  Each episode reminds the viewer of the quality  of acting and the brilliant scripts that made them a Blackadder fan.
The  first episode has Edmund contending with some stupid actors for the  blessings of the dim-witted Prince Regent--in the course of events,  Baldrick is mistaken for an anarchist, the Prince is almost murdered, and  Edmund moves to Sardinia.
In the next episode, Miranda Richardson  portrays Amy Hardwood, an industrialist's daughter whom the Prince wishes  to marry when he finds out that he is broke.  Contains such great lines as  ""The Prince wants your daughter Amy for his wife."" ""Well,  his wife can't have her!"" and ""Baldrick, have you no idea what  irony is?"" ""Yeah, it's just like goldy, and bronzey, but it's  irony.""
The last episode is perhaps the apex of the Blackadders III,  where the Mad King ""Penguin"" George and the mad, mad, madder than  Mad-Jack-McMad, winner of last year's Mr. Madman Competition cousin of  Blackadder arrives from Scotland.  Also starring Stephen Fry as Arthur  Wellsley, Duke of Wellington spouting off such quotes as ""What in the  name of Bonaparte's balls is going on here?""",944438400,3,1385,4.909090909090909
