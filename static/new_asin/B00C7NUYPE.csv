8578355,5,B00C7NUYPE,"I must have fifty or more Just Planes videos in my collection that I have been accumulating for the past ten or twelve years. Sadly these videos are now going to be available only on the secondary market as Just Planes has announced it's ceasing to offer new videos for sale as of December 31, 2015. Their products will now be offered only as computer downloads. Many of the newer videos such as this one are available in the Blu Ray format or HD download. These processes are superior as the sharpness and fine definition of the cockpit videos really helps the viewer see all of the various controls and glass cockpit displays. This particular video is even better than most as Air Canada's Captain Lewis is especially adept at explaining the cockpit controls and displays. He also has a ""folksy"" personality that just enhances his presentations. External views also benefit greatly from the high definition processes. Three United States airports; LGA (New York's La Guardia), DEN (Denver International), and DCA (Washington Reagan) are featured in this production. All in all this is a superior product!",1453248000,,1106,4.951612903225806
8578356,5,B00C7NUYPE,I bought this one because all of the airports they fly into are in the USA!  I wish US airlines would make DVDs like this too but so far the only one I've seen was the one from United back in 1996 which I own and love as well but things have changed a lot since that was filmed.  This DVD from Air Canada features great flight crews as usual and I loved every second of this DVD.,1387929600,,379,3.8461538461538463
