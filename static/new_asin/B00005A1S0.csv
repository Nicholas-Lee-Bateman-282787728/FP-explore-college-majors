The third time WOW!...my awareness went to a higher level and i started having dreams that gave me information i needed and helped me.  My friend also bought the video and he is very pleased with the results. I would suggest to anybody interested in psychic awareness to buy this video.",993254400,18,394,4.535211267605634

I do the attunement every week or so and each time I feel my awareness expanding and the energy coming through. I'm really glad I bought the video.  It's the best money I have spent in a long time. What's even better I can use the video for years. If you are looking for that edge in your awareness, get this video.  I'm going to buy the other two in the Reiki series for my birthday.",992217600,14,461,4.1
1410311,5,B00005A1S0,"I used this DVD for the first time and, when I went to bed that night I asked for strengthened mediumship abilities and spirit communication. That night I woke to a little girl ghost trying to talk to me. When I sat up to talk to her she walked away and disappeared. I wasn't sure if it was a ghost or a vivid dream (she looked very real and I was pretty sure I was awake) but about 2 weeks later a friend was over and when he left late at night, he saw the same girl outside my house peeking in my window. I hadn't given him a description of the girl but his was the same as mine. I believe this video, along with asking the Universe for psychic gifts, opened me up to communication with the child and she was attracted to me. I'm going to try the video again!",1373414400,,761,3.980392156862745

1410313,1,B00005A1S0,I did the attunement about 1 month ago and I don't notice a difference at all. I do plan on doing it again to see if it does.,1351641600,2,125,3.5
1410314,5,B00005A1S0,"I bought this DVD last spring and took the attunment many times since then. All I can say is that I felt a difference after taking it. During the attunment I felt relaxed, warm and tingling sensations in the hands and chakras and sometimes a little floative. I noticed an increase in psychic abilities shortly after viewing the DVD and I feel more peaceful within. I'm not sure why some other folks gave it a one star review? I suppose we're all entitled to our opinions, and I'm certainly not the easiest guy to dupe. If something is poorly done or flat out doesn't work, I will spill the beans loud and proud. But Steve Murray's programs have worked for me... I have quite a collection of his DVD's going and intend to purchase others soon. I have come across plenty of programs in my day that were total flops and frauds. But this is not one of them. Maybe it didn't work for the other folks because they weren't tuned into the energy and intent of the programs creator. The mind is a strange and wonderful thing; if we think something won't work, chances are it won't.",1328227200,2,1072,4.41919191919192
1410315,5,B00005A1S0,"Anybody who are thinking about getting any attunement done, I think it'll be helpful greatly if you read his books and other reiki books on the market. I think it's beneficial to read several reiki masters books to make yourself familiar with different views on reiki. After reading several books, I found the core of the reiki is the same, but then, there are many things that are very different in practices. I personally think his distance attunements that are given by the medium through DVD work just fine, and am intending to progress step by step. Like many reiki masters say, there are different experiences during and after the attunement, and nothing particular is correct or should. I think if you think it'll work, then it's the way for you. If not, then you'll eventually find the right reiki master for your highest good.",1309824000,3,835,4.76551724137931
1410316,4,B00005A1S0,"I have thought about distance attunements, whether Reiki or any other type.  There are so many free or low cost attunements of all kinds available. I have a few reservations. First, since it is a distance attunement you may not actually know what intent is being put out and what power is actually being invoked. Please do your homework and research the type of attunement and person you taking any kind of attunement from. Where Reiki attunements are concerned, the Master should be calling on universal energy so none of his or her energy should be passed on to you, but again, you may not know the person and have no window into their mind so please be cautious when opening yourself to any of these attunements.

Let me first say I am a Reiki Master, shamanic practitioner, and also have taken training in Healing Touch. I do volunteer healing work in local hospitals, don't currently teach, don't have a practice, and have not taken a class nor do I know Steve Murray so I have no vested interest in his or any other Reiki or healing product. I just bring healing for free in our local hospitals as a public service.

It is not needed for the attunement, but you may wish to read Mr. Murray's book on this subject (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reiki-the-Ultimate-Guide-Vol-5-Learn-New-Psychic-Attunements-to-Expand-Psychic-Gifts-Healing-Reiki-The-Ultimate-Guide/dp/0979217784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reiki the Ultimate Guide Vol. 5 Learn New Psychic Attunements to Expand Psychic Gifts & Healing (Reiki: The Ultimate Guide)</a>) before taking the attunement on this video if you are unfamiliar with Steve Murray and Reiki. His book on psychic attunements uses Level 2 Reiki symbols so they differ from the ones used in the video since he is using Usui, Tibetan, and Karuna symbols. He also states he is invoking the Hermetic Law of Similarity during the DVD attunement. This is just to make you aware that you can use the book and attune yourself using Reiki Level 2 symbols if you have been attuned to them and the DVD offers a slightly different attunement from the one in his book.

This video is from 2004 so it is a bit fuzzy as the production quality is rather old in 2011. The audio is okay so the DVD quality is not top notch, but fine (probably a transfer from VHS). It lasts a bit under half an hour. Mr. Murray's email address and website are given if you wish if you wish to contact him and, of course, there is a short blurb for some of this other products. He prepares the viewer by giving a clear explanation of the attunement process, what to expect, what thoughts/frame of mind you should keep during the attunement, and the hand positions (gasho/prayer position, open hands, where to place hands, etc.) the receiver will be using during the attunement. The video is also subtitled so the receiver will know when to change hand positions. The attunement takes place in Sedona at Bell Rock, one of the famous landmarks and vortexes there. Mr. Murray places a crystal on a rock (through which I assume he is sending his intention and symbols) and the viewer looks at the crystal while following the hand positions.

The DVD is titled so you can view the entire video, skip to the preparation for the attunement to review, or jump to the actual attunement if you want to repeat the attunement. In the Western style of Reiki it is generally held the attunement lasts for your lifetime so it is not necessary to take repeated attunements, but in Japan they will repeat attunements and take attunements from each other. Which path you wish to follow is up to you. I have not found repeated attunements to be of any benefit thus far, but some reviewers at Amazon find repeated attunements to be helpful. I am not sure if this is a quality of distance attunements since I received my attunements in person. Mr. Murray recommends repeating the attunement for ""reinforcement"", but does not say how often or how far apart the reinforcement attunements should be taken. Theoretically if the intent is clear the attunement should work, but personally as I already possess some psychic ability I cannot tell you if this will open yours. I did not feel any increase in my psychic abilities. Be aware there isn't necessarily any quick opening or fix regarding psychic abilities. You may be able to achieve the same results with meditation, the shamanic journey, or other methods and simply praciticing.",1308873600,8,4452,4.907038512616202
1410317,1,B00005A1S0,"I purchased this DVD because I thought I could learn something new and the reviews seemed good.
I find that this is a waste of time.  I was thinking about trying out his other products, but not after this one. I would not recommend this DVD even to the beginner.  Bad choice!!!",1302220800,4,277,4.3076923076923075
1410318,5,B00005A1S0,"I got this attunement DVD & loved it.  It felt even more powerful to me than the Reiki Master attunement that I received from a Master that was not Steve Murray.
I think the problem that most folks have with these attunement DVD's, is that they expect INSTANT GRATIFICATION or some instant magical transformation!  With some folks it does work that way.  It depends on how open you really are & it may be more subtle than that for many.  We've all heard the old saying ""Practice Makes Perfect"".  This is no different.  How can anyone expect immediate, totally transforming results, especially when they are doubting it deep down inside.  These things will come to you when you are ready to receive them & not before.  So if you truly want to use these products, especially the DVD attunements, you need to be very open to it!  All the people out there with the long lists of college degrees & certificates must realize that Reiki is not something that you can take in your hand & analyze.  You have to believe in your heart that we all have these gifts & that our ancestors used to use them.  They are just dormant in us.  Our society has taught us that as science, you have to be able to anaylize & PROVE something in order for it to exist.  Reiki is something that you know on a primal, gut level.  The more you practice quieting your mind & really paying attention to what comes to you, the better you will get at it.  So many folks are so busy multi-tasking, that they it's going to be especially hard for them to sit still long enough to TRY to calm their minds & let Reiki work.  You can't be at the gym, on an exercise bike, watching a big screen TV & sending text messages all at the same time & think that Reiki is going to magically work for you.  Practice makes perfect.  Take some time for prayer or meditation before you go to bed & when you first get up in the morning, before your day starts & you'll be amazed at how much different things can be.  As for myself, this DVD has opened many new doors for me on my spiritaul path.  We learn as we go along & when the time is right & we can handle more, we will be given as much as we can handle at that point in our journey thru life.
Don't be skeptical if you can't take these things into consideration.  We are going thru life, destroying natural habitats for the earths wildlife & look at the abuse so many ""domesticated"" animals live thru, yet they still love us, unconditionally.  We are destroying everything in our world, even the world itself & I think we all need to step back & think about the consequences of our actions.  Negativity has no place in Reiki.  So the negative reviews about Steve's products & trying to make them affordable to everyone, is against the 5 major principles for any Reiki person & it is surprizing how many of these so called ""Reiki Masters"" have such negative things to say!  I'll pray & send positive thoughts & intents your way!",1290038400,4,2931,4.324175824175824
1410319,5,B00005A1S0,"Steve Murray's approach to Reiki and healing is excellent.  Steve believes that everyone can benefit from Reiki and his materials show you why.
He walks you through the Attunement procedure so you know what you will be doing. The Attunements can be taken over and over, and provide a variety of experiences for the receiver - all positive, in my experience.

1410320,5,B00005A1S0,"As an avid collector and user of Steve Murray's work, I found this particular dvd attunment not only "" healing "" on so many levels but very effective as I have profound experiences after the attunment. I was able to experience "" smells"" on an individual basis and distinguish them from bad or good. Even in places like the mall, oddly I am able to feel what someone else is feeling by touch.( which is kind of eirie still). I definently reccomend this and all of Steve Murrays work because I feel like he has opened up a new world for me and so many others without ripping us off for thousands of dollars.",1263859200,3,605,4.315789473684211
1410321,5,B00005A1S0,"Steve's set of books and the two DVD's that go along with his Reiki Master program are invaluable for the Reiki Practitioner. The Reiki Master Attunement DVD gave me a true attunement, enhancing my healing abilities. Steve's books, Reiki the Ultimate Guide, Ultimate Guide Vol 2, Ultimate Guide Vol 3, Ultimate Guide Vol 4, and Reiki Beliefs Exposed For All are fabulous and filled with a wealth of information. His DVD, A Reiki 1st, Aura and Chakra Attunement Preformed, is an excellent companion to the books demonstrating the actual processes of performing attunements.

1410323,5,B00005A1S0,"Reiki Psychic Attunement was the first of Steve Murrays dvds I experienced. I can honestly say....wow! At first I was concerned about how short of a presentation I was in for. That all changed after viewing this dvd. Steve Murray gets straight to the point. No fluff or long winded discussions (which I appreciate). Reiki, to me, has always been a very subtle energy. So I wasn't expecting loud explosions, or champagne falling from the heavens. However, what I received was far superior. After watching the dvd, I felt a calm warmth. Shortly after I went to sleep. Experiencing the most lucid, incredible dream I have ever had. The following day my awareness was peaked. I became more aware of the energies around myself and others. Much easier to discern ones aura. I could see past a persons pain.  Above all, it improved my awareness and practice of reiki and reiki energy. Subtle...yet very effective. Although, every persons experience with this dvd may be unique. It will be yours to treasure. Approach it with a humble spirit. Experience it with an open mind. Receive it with a caring heart.",1254268800,5,1099,4.814814814814815

It did take a few weeks after receiving the Attunements before I did notice an improvement in my psychic abilities, and my psychic abilities keep on improving with time. Taking the Psychic Attunement has been successful for me. I'm buying the Psychic Attunement Vol. 2 DVD to take my Psychic abilities to the next level. The few negative reviews I spotted for this DVD you can tell are from skeptics to begin with, and their reviews show they did not give the Attunement time to work. If you are a skeptic and/or and want instant psychic abilities, I do not recommend this DVD because the attunement does not work that way...it's a process. I do recommend the DVD if you are really interested in developing your psychic abilities because it's a great tool to help develop your psychic abilities.",1252972800,6,840,4.760273972602739
1410325,1,B00005A1S0,"What the hell was that?! Disk about 25 minutes duration with one man on screen telling where to put your hands after what you suppose to develop psychic abilities. He made a pause something like 3 sec. when he instructed to ""feel energy from top of your head through body and feet to the ground"" and after 3 seconds: ""fell it same way back"" It's ridiculousness! I used to meditate on my own back in the days with imagining energy through whole body. And this is not that fast and easy especially for someone new who can't possibly know types of energy and can't protect himself from negative one. Production of this DVD is worse I ever seen. They probably borrowed recording device from 50's when first Beatles stereo disk record was made with music in one channel and voices in another. After 5 minutes I've got a headache (I seriously had).
Do not be fooled! Just because you put your hands on your body spots staring on some crystal on your screen you not gonna get the anomalies allowing you to see beyond thing we are allowed to see.
Do not waste your money. Simple Yoga classes if you want can give you the same effect or even more.",1252368000,8,1138,4.423809523809524
1410326,5,B00005A1S0,"This is a wonderful dvd and I would definitely recommend it. I have taken one attunement and I found this to be very powerful. I saw animal totems in the crystal it would seem and I went into a bit of a trance state. Afterwards some parts of me actually healed themselves quite quickly and unexpectedly. I have a general awareness now that I did not before. Although the best benefit of this for personally was a simple one. I now find it much easier to be positive and life seems to have more opportunity and growth. Sure it was always there, but its now easier to see and feel. I have gotten better at scanning my own body and healing in general. Also a couple days afterwards I saw someones aura as it truly was. Usually you don't see the light within shining outward so very strongly but I saw someones angelic presence so to speak and the light within that always shines but is not always known.",1246665600,2,900,4.331360946745562
1410327,5,B00005A1S0,"I learned about Steve's Psychic DVDs after having experience with Steve's Reiki materials.  As usual, he publishes products that far exceed my expectations.  In addition to his Reiki Materials, I also have his Psychic DVDs.

For me, they do work, but they start off subtlety, but build up over time.  I have done the Psychic Attunement several times, and each time I have a different experience, and the experiences build on the prior experiences in intensity and clarity.  Same goes for the second DVD.  Stick with his recommendation of waiting 2 weeks between attunements.

What can I say about Steve Murray and his work... I have been a Reiki practitioner for over a decade, and I can tell you that Steve's books and DVDs are among my most treasured possessions on my book case. I see his work benefiting both existing Reiki practitioners and those just looking to get started.

Steve's books are like GOLD, as they are actually more comprehensive than the materials provided by most Reiki masters to their students. I am sure that many Reiki Masters must be upset with Steve, as he divulges information that most Reiki Masters believe to be secret, including all the symbols up to Master Level, and the attunement processes. Most Reiki books do not include this information, and have been very disappointing to me.

After buying his first book, I decided, after reading the reviews, I needed to own the others. I currently have all 5 Reiki guides and the Reiki myths book. And, of course, the package would not be complete without the DVDs.

I would say, though, that although the first book is excellent, it is not enough for me. I needed the Visual of the DVDs to bring it all home. So, I don't think that you can buy a single book, read it, and walk away a Reiki Master. Each of his books and DVDs, however, complements the others. With the combination of the Books, DVDs, studying and practice, you CAN BECOME A REIKI MASTER.

What's awesome about the DVDs is that you can take the attunements over and over again. As someone who was attuned in person by a Reiki Master over a Decade ago, I can attest to the DVD attunements as being every bit as effective as in person.

My only criticism is that the whole package should be sold as a complete set, as once you get started, you will want the whole set anyway. However, I guess that most will not want to plunk down that money (even though it is completely reasonable in the scheme of things) without first experiencing the quality of it with the first book.

If you are interested in Reiki, and don't want to waste your time and money with disappointments, just get this material, and you will not regret it.",1238716800,4,2667,4.60126582278481
1410328,1,B00005A1S0,"I am a Reiki Master three times over, and I bought this DVD to see if it worked. Hey, who wouldn't like to be a bit more psychic? I certainly would!

If only I were a bit more psychic I would already have known to pass on Steve Murray's DVDs, they don't work. Distant attunements DO work, if you have a real, live person giving you the distant attunement. However, this DVD is not a person - it is a recording. Not the same energy or vibration as a person, no matter how good or strong the intent is. I got nothing from this DVD.

What also bugs me is that Steve gives no credit to the source of many of the non-Usui things that were developed by others, for example, Psychic Surgery/Aura Clearing was developed by William Rand, his former teacher, who in turn got if from the Hawaiian Hunas he studied with when he lived in Hawaii. It is a shamanic based procedure for extractions. Do yourself a favor, and just buy William Rand's books to learn how to do that from the source.

Many people feel relaxed after watching Steve's DVDs, but they can get the same feeling looking at their own crystals in their own house, playing some much cheaper and nicer music, such as Shamanic Dream by Anugama. You don't need a fake Reiki attunement to do that.

Sorry, in my opinion Steve has learned that instead of taking the time to teach people face to face or even on a personal level long distance, it is much more profitable to make a DVD and sell it to unwitting people. Yes, one can even ""self attune"" to an energy, but it's not REIKI, which is systematic, and passed from Master to student, normally in person, but certainly on a person-to-person level, not impersonal mass market.

If you're too cheap or broke to afford Reiki training, there actually are real, live, qualified Reiki Masters out there who will do it for you for free, do it for real, and do it live. Find one, and skip this ""offer.""",1238371200,14,1896,4.375

If you've never ever meditated, then this might be for you.  Otherwise, it can actually be quite distracting.  I'd say read a how-to book on meditation, then just sit and do it.  You'll do just as well.",1223251200,3,373,4.257142857142857

Sure, the DVD actual program seems simple - listen to Steve a few minutes then meditate upon a crystal doing some hand positions - done.  But that's not the whole experience.  I found the time spent within meditation opening states of relaxation I had found hard to do on my own.  Most psychics/healers don't allow themselves to take time to 'work on their own learning and growing' as much as they should - this DVD allowed me to do just that.  Take some guided time for just ME.  I found that by letting my ""concerns and high immediate expectations"" go...(""microwave society"" doesn't exclude people who are in touch with their other senses; we still have to work on not living in this frame of thought)...that I was able to reach a stillness to which I grew in my abilities.  Nice thing is that by owning the DVD, you can take this moment time and again.  Are you going to feel instantly transformed, maybe or maybe not - BUT you WILL have grown and that growth will show up as you continue to move throughout your daily life.

I am by nature open minded but cautious. I read Steve's website top to bottom and was inspired by the truth as I read it. It resonated with something deep inside me. I was very drawn to his openness and perspectives on Reiki and decided that this was the right path to follow. I have not been disappointed at all!!  Very congruent in all his writing and his mission statement.
His DVD's and books empower you on whatever level you are interested in learning. He is a true teacher. You can read it, see it and feel the energy.

Suffice it to say that those Reiki recipients whom I have been working with for some time have commented that they notice an increase in Reiki power -- and they didn't know that I had been doing further study with Steve Murray's Usui Reiki system products; they simply knew something was different. As a newly-signed author myself, I love his writing style; Steve is straight to the point without unnecessary wording --- I like and appreciate that.
Steve Murray's books and DVDs and absolutely priceless and will remain in my personal library as invaluable reference materials in the years to come.

1410334,5,B00005A1S0,"After being attuned to the 3 Reiki DVD's, I tried it out on 1 of my massage clients. He was more than willing to be my Guniea pig. I asked him not to tell me if anything was wrong, I wanted to see if I could figure it out on my own. While i was performing the session, i felt tingling going all over my hands & going up my arms. I wasn't sure if it was the Reiki or if my hands were falling asleep from holding them up for so long. They tingled all over his body. When our breif session (maybe about 15 minutes) was over, I asked him if he was sore all over. He responded, ""Yes! How did you know?"" I told him, ""I just knew."" Still not sure if it was the Reiki, his wife, who is a dear friend, reinforced it for me. She said, ""He said he NEVER felt anything like it in his life. He never felt such heat generated from something that wasn't touching his body."" I believe this is proof that the Reiki Steve's teachings and attunements work.

His books are so helpful in answering questions that he didn't have time for on the DVD's. So far, my favorite is the ""False Beliefs"" book. I started out with that book. The others reiterate it & therefore, I believe make the Reiki stronger because you can understand it better. Steve is a wonderful teacher and is so helpful in answering your questions. There is no doubt in my mind that he is an even better teacher in person. If I had the money to visit him in California, I would. He is a very special person.  BDB",1211500800,,1457,4.073170731707317
1410335,5,B00005A1S0,"Ten years ago, one of the worst things that can happen to a man happened to me.  And that would be a devastatingly painful condition of the testicle that lasted twenty four hours a day, accompanied by equally terrible rectal pain.  I was twenty seven, just bought my first house,  just married, just promoted to managing the largest drug store in town, and life was supposed to be grand.  And except for working seventy hours a week, things were ok.  I felt like I needed something new and exciting in my life, something thrilling.  So this translated to buying a Racing-type street bike.  I had a bike as a kid, a Suzuki, so I already knew how to ride, and I had really enjoyed it, and missed the thrill of the wind and the speed.
This desire for the exotic would be my ruin.  After riding only a couple of months, I think the strain of working so many hours, plus all the heavy lifting I did in the stockroom, plus the notorious strain put on the groin area by the nick named ""crotch rocket"", it was just all too much.  I developed not only pain but down on your knees pain, and had to continue working seventy hour weeks, it was retail, merciless.  I kept going back to my urologist and he just could not figure it out, dragging out the damage and pain further over time.  Finally after it had got to the point of me having to take a sauna bath Before and after work, I was able to diagnose my self.  After about twenty minutes in the hot water I realized that my right testicle could spin completely backwards like a face turning all the way around to face the back.  That is not physically posible, and that is called a Tortion of the testicle.  A tortion of the testicle which spins more than a 360 on it self can kill a testicle in a matter of minutes, completely cutting all blood supply to the testicle.  I think mine had only gotten to 340, so I just had the pain, and the nerve damage and all the strange effects of letting that continue unchecked for six months.
So, after I diagnosed myself to my doctor, I made perhaps a fatal flaw.  I allowed him to do the surgery.  He needed to basically sew it in place, that was it.  But perhaps by that time so much damage was done to the nerves, I was beyond true surgical solution.  I had the surgery and my allotted one week recovery time, yeah, one week.  And went back to a downward spiral of blinding pain, emotions way out of control, so many different prescription drugs I know they have taken years off my life, divorce, bankruptcy- for medical costs, foreclosure, fighting the state system for disability, fighting my insurance company for  my disability long term insurance, monthly prescription costs that look like a New York penthouse rental, to having to move back in with my folks, God bless them.
Now that sums up the past eleven years and I tell you, I have really not had any good news since, I even developed a skin type condition on the scrotum area, probably from nerve damage, that required steroids a couple years ago that probably was going to cut my life span in half.  But Reiki has completely healed that skin condition, in just a matter of a couple months,  and I no longer have to use steroids and just that alone is a miracle to me!
For the first time in over a decade I can cut back on the meds enough to keep my head clear enough to read and learn again, and that is a miracle to me!  I am not stupid by a long shot, I have a Bachelor of Business Management from a major University, an IQ of 160, carried mostly A's and B's, but I am on so many different prescriptions for pain, at such high levels, I have trouble seeing the text on the page, much less concentrating!
Reiki seems to really be helping me in every way, I am using it in every way I can to heal physically, mentally, emotionally, and most importantly, spiritually, because I have been bitter.  I have experienced positive rebounds in each of these areas in just three months, if you put faith in the system and just let it work, you can literally cure yourself.  Anyone who has read the ""Secret"" knows that healing with the power of the mind has been discussed as a real mental phenomenon, this is more like the ""Secret"" on Steroids!  Reiki connects you to a sacred source that I can only compare to God, and promotes strong fast healing on all levels.  And Reiki is also a system that allows you to direct the type of healing you most need and where you need it, it is hard to explain to those hearing about it for the first time.  Usually you get the look.  But you have to accept that this system works, there are forces in the Universe greater than humans and no, they don't have to answer to us.  My dream would be to completely heal myself 100 percent, and then find employment using this wonderful system, I will keep using Reiki to try and make this a reality.  By making this amazing system available to the average to more than average down trodden Joe, Mr. Murray has taken a self-less path of spreading this powerful knowledge to the masses, instead of those who would keep it a secret and sell it for a fortune to a fortunate few.  This is a spiritually enlightened man who recognizes that salvation of a generation is worth more than salvation of a federation.
  Without Steve Murray's Reiki Program, I would still be declining in health, barely holding on to life, just barely.
I can not honestly say I would be alive right now, had I not found Steve Murray's Reiki Books and Attunement Dvd's.
Steve, Thank you does not seem like enough.",1210896000,6,5503,4.356513222331048
1410336,5,B00005A1S0,"I have many of Steve Murray Reiki DVDs, and they are the best. The Reiki DVDs do pass the Reiki Attunements very well. And the Reiki Books are very informative and easy to understand. I love the photos and drawings in the books because it makes what he explains very easy to comprehend.

From reading the reviews of the few people who do not like him because of his books and DVDs, it looks like to me these are the Reiki people he writes about in his Reiki False Beliefs Exposed for all. LOL no wonder they dislike him and his work. He has exposed them and they are angry. It is this small group of people who only want you to learn Reiki their way, because they think their way is the only way, and they are always right. And by coincidence it's usually the most expensive way to learn Reiki, and with them giving classes.

The big difference between Mr. Murray and his detractors is that he teaches you can learn Reiki many ways and his teachings are one option; just make your own decision with learning Reiki with what works the best for you. Every person has Reiki naturally. What books, DVDs and classes show you is how to use it for yourself and others. In fact some people use Reiki successfully without any guidance or teachings. Most of Mr. Murray's critics do not want you to know this either.

From reading a few of Mr. Murray's reviews it seems he has changed people's lives around the world, so he is doing a good thing. Mr. Murray's Reiki teachings are not for all, but at least he is open minded to know this, and would never tell you his Reiki path is the only correct one.

The books are clear and concise, containing all the information a Reiki person of any level shoul be able to find ( sadly that does not happen due to the secrecy and vested interest of some people in the Reiki world).

The DVDs are fatastic tools ( they are as powerful as in person attunements, and who say the contrary does not really understand the mechanics of Reiki or does not want to).

It is true that the books do not contain pictures of standard hand positions or the history of Usui Sensei and Mrs Takata ( but every other single book in the market does, so I truly understand Steve Murray not needing to repeat then once again and concetrate in the material that so far has been kept hiden for not a very good reason at all).

Resume : This is truly the best material any Reiki person should have in his or her library.

1410340,5,B00005A1S0,"Steve Murray's Reiki books are well worth purchasing, whether you are a beginner wishing to learn, or an intermediate student looking for reference material. His detailed instructions and lavish photo demonstrations of the various attunements and techniques are invaluable for those who don't want to memorize or can't remember something they've been taught in a weekend class.

The attunement DVDs are a wonderful low cost way to receive the attunements, especially for those who are not intending to go into Reiki as a business, but simply want to learn how to do Reiki for themselves, family and friends. My personal belief, based upon my own experience is that long distance attunements do work. I've been doing Reiki for myself and for those near and dear to me. I feel the success of the treatments is vouched for by the number of people who've been referred to me.

I appreciate Steve's attitude that the actual healing is the important thing, and that lineage and apprenticeship to a Reiki Master should take a back seat to that. Some people do need that sort of structure and instruction, and that's fine. Those so inclined should definitely pay the money and take a class to receive their attunements. Personally, I already had a background in Therapeutic Touch and Crystal healing, & I view Reiki as an enhancement of what I was already doing.

I found Steve Murray's books and DVDs valuable, & I'm pleased with his maverick view of a subject which should be allowed to grow and evolve, lest Reiki fall prey to too much ceremony and institutionalism.",1196208000,2,1561,4.8830188679245285
1410341,5,B00005A1S0,"I had taken Reiki Level 1 and Level 2 from a Reiki Master in Sedona, AZ,  and felt that I wanted to further my Reiki education, but didn't know where to start.  I had questions about Reiki that my Reiki Master couldn't answer, and so, I didn't feel confident to go out into the world and practice Reiki in a professional setting.  I knew that clients would ask me questions that I, like my Reiki Master, wouldn't be able to answer.  So, I prayed for guidance and asked to be directed to someone who could help me.

Not long after my prayer, I found Steve Murray purely by accident.  I had gone into a bookstore in Sedona, AZ and on a shelf in front of me was his ""Reiki Psychic Attunement"" DVD.  I was a little skeptical at first, since my Reiki Master had told me that attunements needed to be received in person, but something about his creative use of Reiki intrigued me, so I purchased the DVD, along with Steve's ""Reiki Healing Attunement"" DVD, and I still can't believe the results I received!

I received such powerful attunements from his DVD's!!  I had always been psychic with natural healing abilities, but his attunements seemed to amplify my skills even more!  I began having consistent clairvoyant visions after taking his ""Reiki Psychic Attunement"" DVD, and I received almost instant healing of some stress related conditions, I had been dealing with for some time, shortly after taking his ""Reiki Healing Attunement"", from his DVD.  The results I received were nothing short of miraculous!  I definitely knew then that there was power in his DVD attunements!  And that attunements didn't have to be taken in person in order to be effective!

So, I purchased all the rest of his DVD's and Books and have never been disappointed!!  His Books are written so clearly and concisely that anyone, no matter what their educational background can understand them .  Steve is very generous with the wealth of information he provides in both his Books and his DVD's , and when I was finished (reading his books and taking his attunements) I truly felt I had finally attained a solid foundation from which to practice Reiki professionally.

I ended up finishing my Reiki Master with Steve Murray, and I truly feel it's the best decision that I have ever made!  All my questions about Reiki have finally been answered through his Books and DVD's and I feel so grateful to have found him!

If you are interested in Reiki education, there is no better person to work with than Steve Murray!  I have read many, many Reiki authors and there is no one that comes close!  I am convinced, that the results you'll receive, from Steve Murray's Reiki Books and DVD's, will truly astound you!  As they have truly astounded me!  I don't care what anyone says, distance attunements really work!!!

My dream has been, for sometime now, to practice Reiki professionally, but I was afraid to, because I didn't feel I had all my questions answered. I didn't feel I had a solid foundation from which to work from, but now, because of Steve Murray's Books and DVD's, I feel that I finally have the knowledge and confidence necessary to succeed!  Steve Murray's Reiki Books and DVD's have truly made my dream a reality!  And for that, I will be forever grateful to him!

Whether your goal is to work professionally with Reiki, or to use it to heal and enhance your everyday life, you can't go wrong with Steve Murray's Books and DVD's.  They are truly worth the investment!  I know I will be referring to them for reference, and reinforcement, for many years to come!  God bless Steve Murray!",1195344000,8,3575,4.646496815286624

Your attunement really worked in focusing on my inner self, with the relaxation, and opening up to the universe at the same time.

His books and DVDs are really thorough and they work. When I watched his 1st level dvd I had a chronic ear infection that cleared up over night. From watching all of his DVDs I've had many wonderful coincidences with prosperity and relationships take place that can only be attributed to the programs influence.

  This dvd is my favorite. It really has helped open my intuition and connection with nature. I am also studying A Course In Miracles and plan to incorporate it with this attunement since the expanded perception has also made me more aware of other people's  'stuff', like their own fear, self hatred etc.  Of course this serves to build compassion, but the process of reading  ACIM recognizes the only truth as love. This dvd allows that  psychic energy to keep building and ACIM ensures it is steered in the only direction worth experiencing,  peace and love !",1180656000,3,1107,4.65979381443299

1410355,5,B00005A1S0,"My best recommendation for this DVD is:  Play it--& put the disc away out of sight--& then put it out of your mind that you've even done so.  For about 2 to 3 weeks.  Then look back over time & see how much you've opened up intuitively, in what ways, & what has changed for you.  Everyone's experience will be unique to their own personal needs, aptitudes, & present abilities - & you will receive what your psyche is ready for.

The first time I played this DVD, I noticed a general expansion in my intuitive perception in matters both large & small, mundane & esoteric; increased creative problem solving abilities; marked improvement in my connection with my primary guide during tarot readings; the arrival of & sensitivity to new spirit guides; & a sudden inspiration to pursue, along with a newfound ability to understand, certain areas of metaphysical study that were previously shut out to me.  Such as the I Ching, which falls about squarely in the middle of my lifelong math problem...& it's close cousin Feng Shui.

I primarily use this DVD because I am an empath who gets so bombarded by psychic impressions on a constant basis, that it drives me nuts--& I often unconsciously or consciously pull the plug on it, shut things down, & take a break for a while.  Once this happens, it can be hard to get my intuitive abilities back up & running again, if I feel a situation has arisen where I really need to use it.  Playing this DVD helps me to do so.  I find that I can also use this DVD with the predetermined intent to open up my psychic awareness to a specific matter or to a subject of study, as well as in a more general way.

Along with the 3 Disk Reiki Attunement Program - this is my favorite DVD by Steve Murray.  You will not need any education or experience with Reiki, or anything else really, to benefit from using this DVD.  Anyone & everyone can benefit from its use--curious novices, natural intuitives, psychic readers, & Reiki practitioners alike.",1164931200,41,1976,4.532394366197183

If you order his books they complement the CD's and his entire program is hundreds of dollars cheaper then any place else, plus you get to keep the DVD's and rewatch them for reinforement later on. This particular DVD is a Pychic Attunement that really helped open me up and has helped my Reiki Sessions as well...

I just finished reading all three of Steve Murray's Reiki Ultimate Guide Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 & 3 ...

Vol. 2 & 3 go deeper into using Reiki via Chakras, and the Aura...

These books don't just talk about Reiki they teach you how to apply it

and in several ways, so you can treat those you love, or your clients in a way that is suited to their needs... I wish I had come upon these books first as they are really all that is needed in any Reiki book shelf.

Not to mention once you are a Reiki Master you have his first book that

teaches you; with easy step by step (photos included) on how to pass these

Attunements to others, so you can become a Reiki Master/Teacher as well...

I'm excited to try all the new techniques I've learned - and there are many within the pages, and best yet there are photos with detailed information embedded in them to better help you perform your Reiki Sessions. Another thing I love about this series is you will never get bored of Reiki as your not doing the same thing for each person - which is how it should be in any healing technique.

Steve Murray also teaches in a simple to understand manner and there

is no arrogance involved. I feel his books are inspired to help those of

us that are having trouble finding a Reiki Master or learning Reiki, as he

is open and upfront and doesn't leave anything out.

I bought his DVD's as well, and they are state of the art - so if your having trouble finding a Reiki Master (like I did), then this series is

exceptional. I've been attuned in person by a Reiki Master and via: Steve

Murray's DVDs--and I can say I wish I had found Steve Murray's first as it would have saved me tons of money. Not mention I have the books to refer back to without wondering after My Reiki Master leaves the house, what I'm supposed to do with all the information (and unanswered questions)...

Plus you can get your certificate through his program, and I still don't have mine from my Reiki Master, nor is it easy to reach her as a lot of people seem to have this trouble - making it another great reason to Turn to Steve Murray - as the answers are always there and he has a great support website and even answers my e-mails... And the bonus is; the Certificates really do arrive...

I've enjoyed these programs and I truly believe I was brought to them via

""Divine intervention"" which paved the way for me to find what I was searching for... Whatever you decide in your search for Reiki and it's teachings, may the Universal Life Force energy grace your path...",1164931200,16,3119,4.311643835616438
1410357,4,B00005A1S0,"When I first received the Psychic Attunement, I was excited. Steve Murray instruct the initiate to focus on expanding one's psychic ability during the attunement. After the first attunement, I felt lightheaded (this was at night) and while trying to watch some TV, ultimately decided to go to sleep. The next day, I felt a slight change, a feeling of wellbeing. I must admit that while Steve Murray adviced to use the attunement only once every 3 weeks, I was initially impatient and for the next 2 days, did the attunement again, once for each day. Somehow, I do not feel any difference and get this gut feeling that I am supposed to do the attunement and later give it time to manifest itself. For the next 1 month I didn't do the attunement but each time I thought abt it, I have this feeling that the attunement is creating a process of change within me. 3 days ago I did the psychic attunement again and as usual, I visualise myself manifesting several psychic abilities. This time the results was more amazing. I felt that i have became more perceptive and when I met or talked with strangers, I was somehow able to know who they are and what they are hiding. I do not think that its a placebo effect. my experiences within the last few days are non-ordinary. Its akin to feeling a new dimension in my mind. The feeling akin to the difference between 2D and 3D. I am not saying that i feel it in its entirety. But its there and I am beginning to experience and feel it. Amazing stuff. It can be a slow subtle process as well depending on the individual make-up such as it was for me within the first few weeks. Hope this review helps, cheers!",1163030400,14,1648,4.406557377049181

1410359,5,B00005A1S0,"Recently while searching for some music, I came across Steve Murray's DVD programs for attunement. First impression was that, this must be fake. As it was in total contradiction to the learning's I learnt during my Reiki 2nd degree in India. I went on to read the reviews and none of the reviews were negative. All people including some Reiki masters were in praises for Steve's program. I took the chance and ordered his first book, 1st cd and DVD attunement for 2nd degree. I wanted to take this again for reinforcement and to give my wife 2nd degree who was a 1st degree. (My intention was to try his claim first before I venture into a master attunement of Reiki through DVD)

 Last week I received the dvd and the first thing was to play the dvd to see myself, if it works. It did work. It was a very powerful attunement & I received it all through a DVD, isn't it amazing.. Immediately after that my wife took the attunement and she also felt extreme heat and tingling sensation. Now she is a 2nd degree and her Reiki is flowing beautifully. The first line of his book, which says ""I believe at this very moment as you read this, our vibrations and energies are connected in the now"". As soon as I read this I felt I am connected to Steve. When I played his attunement cd part 1, I felt a gentle shower of Reiki all over me. Its playing right now and I can feel Reiki all around me. Since then I have taken both 1st & 2nd degree attunements a couple of times and every time I feel an increase in my energy levels. I feel my hearing ability has increased; now I can pick up sounds quite far from me. My smelling ability has increased, my concentration and consciousness has increased too.

 Giving attunements like this proves that Reiki works in past present and future all layered together. This even supports the string theory proposed by Einstein and the 11 dimensions we live in. probably Reiki works in all those 11 dimensions just by our intent. Steve has done a great think to mankind by his video programs. He is in fact a time traveler who travels forward and backwards in time by his Reiki and gives the attunement to us whenever we watch his videos and listen to his cds. His attunements on Dvd cost just 30 whereas taking a master attunement cost $1,000 in India and up to $10,000 in US. He has made Reiki available to the masses virtually at no cost. This way more and more people can use this power and be healed and heal others. Reiki is a free gift from the supreme power and should be available for masses. I honor his Reiki mission which is to spread Reiki to everybody for their betterment.

I also ordered his subliminal programs; currently I am using Quit Smoking and Stress relief. Only 3 days have passed doing these programs. I already feel that my stress levels are going down. The second day I lit the cigarette but I couldn't pull, I felt as if the smoke is killing me. Immediate reaction was to throw the cigarette and now I don't feel like smoking anymore, touchwood. Next weekend I will be taking my master level attunement and I feel so happy about it.

Two days back i tried the psychic attunement dvd. Since last 5 years i felt that my third eye was blocked and there was minimal or no flow of reiki over there. My previous two reiki master gurus agreed to this but could not do much about it. Because of this factor i was not able to concentrate well too. I wrote to Steve and he asked me to take this psychic attunement. I felt very powerful vibrations during the attunement and i can still feel that energy is flowing through third eye. i will again take it after three weeks(Steve says that this should not be repeated before 3 to 4 weeks). Since then I am feeling at a higher elevated level. Yesterday mailman came and I asked him about my packet which I was expecting. He said that he does not have mine. Intuitively I told him that its in the van, he didn't agree and said that he knows his packets well to deliver. I looked inside the van and there were a lot of packets. Intuitively my eyes stopped at one and I told him that see this packet. Reluctantly he took that packet out of the heap and guess what, it was my packet of the rest of the products from Steve.. This is the power of this attunement. Just take this but don't expect a miracle, let things unfold on there own. You will see a difference in yourself.

I recommend the entire set of dvd's and books by Steve to everyone who is on a spiritual or just healing journey. Once you use these products with a open mind, your life will never be the same again

I urge everybody to experience Reiki. It can change your life for good in so many ways. It will heal you on all levels and make your surroundings more pleasant. After some time of continuous use, you will feel that things have started falling back in place on their own. You can go and take a Reiki session from a Reiki healer or try ""Reiki 1st Level Attunement - Become a Reiki Healer (2004)"" by Steve Murray. Any of the options will not cost you more then 30 - 40 bucks and you can experience the divine power of Reiki. It's such a nice experience to feel life sustaining force flowing through your body at your wish and you can direct it anywhere you like, even heal a living being.

1410362,5,B00005A1S0,"After over a decade-and-a-half of meditation and self-discovery, I came upon Steve Murray's DVDs and books.  There I discovered a whole new world through Reiki. Steve talks and walks us through each step, so that anyone can receive his Attunements with ease.  After having taken the Reiki Psychic Attunement a couple of times, I began to notice that ideas and answers were coming to me out of nowhere concerning all areas of my life, and this increases noticeably after every Attunement now. It's like supercharging your sixth-sense! The increase in my everyday awareness that I have experienced is distinct and plainly recognizable, as well as the wonderful and rewarding ability to contact angels and my spirit guides. I cannot say enough about this incredible DVD from Steve Murray.  Also, my wife and I both use Steve's Healing Attunement (we bought all 5 Reiki DVDs) every week, simply because IT WORKS on any issue; mental, physical, emotional.  Moreover, I have had an intense interest in healing for quite some time.  Following the Reiki level 1 Attunement, I felt a mild yet powerful energy as I was channeling (or giving) Reiki to my wife while she was in labor just a few days later. She tells me that her pain was greatly diminished and she did have the baby quite easily for a very petite woman. Unbelievable!  Then I ordered the Reiki level 2 and Reiki Master Attunements just days after that and have been channeling Reiki to my wife, newborn girl and myself.  I recommend ALL of Steve Murray's DVDs, which have changed my life - literally improving my quality of life, as well as that of my family and friends!",1149638400,16,1626,4.785714285714286
1410363,4,B00005A1S0,"Just to add... I am a massage therapist for now for about four years & also have taken two Reiki classes for first & second degree.
I have already seen Murray's ""Reiki Healing Attunement Heal Emotional-Mental-Physical-Spiritual Issues"" & reviewed it.
This DVD was the same, only a few minutes of introduction about Reiki & that you don't have to believe in any religion, etc. & 20 min of attunement which is staring at a crystal in Sedona on a large rock & the video is actaully paused.
I had more trouble then the other DVD in concentrating on the video & focusing & not thinking of daily things, but towards the end I did feel a little more connection like I do during my sessions that seemed stronger, though it was hard to hold it.
Since this review, I have viewed it several more times & though I have trouble holding my concentration, I have felt more calm & centered then ever before. I have been told by almost all my friends & clients who have known me months or longer then I feel much more powerful & relaxed.
I know he has other videos where he uses SUBLIMINAL sound & pictures so maybe that's how he gets the attunements to work better. It also could be a placebo effect. If it is, as long as it works....",1149379200,5,1218,4.3464912280701755
1410364,5,B00005A1S0,"Steve's Reiki products are a wonderful gift to the world.

I started my Reiki path with the ""traditional"" day school and expensive level 1 attunement. Most of the class time was spent on politics and differing ""histories"" of Reiki. I was surprised at how little of the actual Reiki practice and ""hands on"" there was.

I had been a natural energy healer for years and some of the stuff that they taught really didn't make sense to me, based on my many successes with energy healing.

So instead of staying for the 2nd say - I bought Steve's 3 books and 4 DVDs  (level1, level2, master, and psychic attunements) and loved them.  The attunemants are at least as powerful as the in person one I had, and I am VERY sensitive to energy.

After Steve's attunements and books I have a definite ""feeling the flow"" of Reiki every time I invoke the power.

Steve's books made so much more sense than the ""traditional"" school to a healer like myself. It is obvious he really understands the energy he works with and the true power of intention.

Maybe it's because I am already psychic or maybe it was because I had a cold and had to blow my nose. But the thing that bothers me most is the price that is being charged for this dvd. I could see $8.99 (maybe) because of the short length of the program, but not the $29.99 that they are trying to squeeze out of you. In comparison...Shakti Yoga by Shiva Rea has at least 3 hours of programs or more and is very slick in the way it was produced. I'm sure that production was very expensive and I know that the price is worth what you are getting. There were no slick productions on this dvd and I just didn't get it.

Information that is gently revealed to me regarding my own health, what I should be doing with my life, my spiritual path and interaction with those around me.

1410379,5,B00005A1S0,"Let me begin by saying that I was rather dubious about receiving a Reiki Attunement via DVD.  So I did my research on Steve Murray and after visiting his website I was sold!  Being an intuitive, who has received Seichem Reiki Attunements, I was drawn to Steve's methods and his energy.

I ordered The Reiki Psychic Attunmement, and did it as soon as it arrived.  It was one of the most powerful Attunements that I have ever received! During the Attunement I watched the crystal as directed. Steve's energy was palpable.  It was more powerful than any of the Attunements that I have received from my Seichem Master. At the conclusion of the Attunement I felt wonderful. A sense of joy and happiness radiated through me.  Within about 30 minutes I began to experience pre-cognitive sight. Since then my readings have become more informative, allowing me to access more information than ever before.

I was so impressed with this Attunement that I have ordered Steve's First and Second level Attunements and plan to become a Usi Reiki Master via his DVD Attunements.

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone seeking to reach a higher level of awareness!",1121212800,19,1149,4.7969543147208125
1410380,5,B00005A1S0,"I think anything by Steve Murray is a gift to this world since many Reiki Masters, such as myself, are not sure how to present this material to the public with full knowledge and confidence. I was attuned by a wonderful Reiki master from Lebanon and not Steve so I can attest that Steve's methods, by book and video, are revolutionary in teaching Reiki and are a sure fire way to attune others (given a Reiki master does not need to be present for this to happen since it is sent from a higher level and beleive me you will know this when you are attuned).  I think some people should consider going through all the Reiki attunements,either in person or video, prior to the psychic VHS tape anyway because I can see how a few people will not  develop this type of ability due to the excitement of getting answers right away, or wanting to disprove the whole psychic thing anyway due to beliefs that there is no afterlife .  I guess it is like demanding the money you need from a lottery scratch ticket without even scratching it first.  I looked at other reviews of the few people who have critisized this method and it seems all the books and videos they had seen outside of Reiki material had the same responses so I think this should be taken into account when making your decision on this. I have nothing bad to say about these people because they are the one's who will never enjoy a peaceful life and after looking at my life...it was never that good either until I was attuned into Reiki so I don't blame them.

1410381,5,B00005A1S0,"I watched this Psychic Attunement with an open mind and welcoming heart, listening intently and peacefully with a readiness to Receive.  After watching I can honestly say it has opened up a door in my life. I feel more aware of my surroundings and my loved ones.  I wish I could tell you all that happened during my viewing of the video but I don't think I am supposed to and you probably wouldn't believe me. It is as Steve said, ""There is no right or wrong experience, just the experience."" I will say that there was a communion between my mind and my spirit.  A Knowing came inside me that is Holy. After viewing I was radically changed. I thought I got sick but realize now that it was a healing crisis as Steve said sometimes happens in another vhs I watched a week or so after this one and that this occurs to enable one to be cleansed in order to give Reiki more efficiently.  I had pain in my body--my neck, head and especially my hands.  They felt so swollen that I couldn't wear my rings nor hardly move my fingers. But it left in a few days and now they feel stronger than ever and they look young, healthy and beautiful. Also my eyes have a renewed spark of vitality.  I know this all probably sounds odd but I am telling you it is the truth! I would definitely recommend if you want to open yourself up to some enormous psychic energy for yourself and for others, to view this video and all you can get your hands on by Steve Murray, Reiki Master and certified Medical Hypnotherapist.

I first bought the Reiki Master Attunement video and was completely blown away! After taking the attunement the first time, I felt a very warm glow all around my head for the next couple of hours! I have taken the attunements twice since then, and have experience more of that same warmth, as well as noticing a slight change(intensity) in the energy when I channel Reiki.
I recently purchased the Reiki Psychic Attunement video and was equally astounded! I have only taken the attunement once, (you can take the attunements many times for reinforcement, but with this attunement Steve recommends waiting 3-4 weeks between attunements), but have had a couple of very vivid dreams since that day!

Of course I did not see visions or start to read people's minds,  but for me it has been a subtle change of awareness which has helped me in my life. I have been working on my awareness for some time now, would it have happened without this attunement program, don't know but i'm sure it would have been slower to get where I am at now. I think the attunement cleared me so I could process information more clearly and faster like Steve Murray said in the program.
It seems this attunement helps everybody to where they should be in their psychic development, and everybody is at different levels and on different time lines on development.
If you are looking for a tool to help you with your psychic awareness, I recommend this program.

I felt so sorry for her and wished with all my heart that I could help her.
Suddenly these names and faces came to me and started communicating to me for her.
I knew her mom and friends name ,how they passed and their was a very long conversation. The young lady was so happy and relieved to here from them and that was the day I began my work as a psychic medium.
