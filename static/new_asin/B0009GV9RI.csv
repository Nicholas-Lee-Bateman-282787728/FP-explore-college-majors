2289609,5,B0009GV9RI,"In the instructor catagory, Keli is in my top 3.  I have done many of her workouts and when I needed to lose weight, I did via her dvds.  Even now, I still do this workout every now and then to boost my metabolism again, because it's tough but so effective and fun.

In this, there are aerobic/toning intervals for a little under 40 minutes (the most effective way to burn fat and calories) and then there is body sculpting.  It is tough, but so worth while.  She is very motivating yet has a no-nonsense method.  The choreography is great and makes it fun.  It is an advanced workout, so don't jump right into this if you haven't worked out for a while.  When I first got this about 3 years ago, I couldn't do much of it at all, but by doing it in parts over time, and other easier workouts, I got there and it's worth it to keep trying.  You won't be disappointed.",1155254400,10,866,4.168674698795181
2289610,5,B0009GV9RI,"Keli Roberts is quickly surpassing Kathy Smith for me as my favorite video aerobics instructor.  I do her 10 Minute Solution Kickbox regularly; and now this one is also going to be a steady routine in my workouts.

This is a great mix of cardio and weights.  It is similar to Kathy Smith's Fat Burning Breakthrough, except that there is more emphasis on strength training than step cardio.  Since I am working on building up muscle and metabolism, that makes this video more suited for my needs.  My back, arms and thighs were very sore after this, which was a good thing because I am not as challenged these days as I would like to be.

The step combinations are probably challenging.  I've taken my share of step/dance classes, so these weren't a big deal for me, but I could see how someone less experienced would be thrown for a loop.  My advice is keep at it and you'll get it.  I suspect the overall combo of cardio and weights will pay off in the end.",1144022400,16,958,4.3977272727272725
2289611,5,B0009GV9RI,"When I first tried this workout I was a little intimidated because it looked confusing, but once I did it, it wasn't bad.  Now, I don't even have to watch the video, I know it by heart.  I love this step workout, it is fun, effective, and doesn't get boring like so many others.  You can mix and match the workouts so you can do all cardio, cardio and weights, or only weights.  I hope Keli has additional workouts or puts some out soon!  If you like step, this is one to have!!",1142726400,9,478,4.096774193548387
2289612,5,B0009GV9RI,The routines are easy to follow but not boring over time.  The workout is challenging even for a seasoned exercise fanatic.  It has a nice focus on thighs but touches on all muscle groups.  I am a fan of Keli Roberts who provides clear instuction without the needless chatter that can become annoying if heard over and over.  This is a 5 star exercise video.,1140825600,8,358,4.461538461538462
2289613,3,B0009GV9RI,"I first discovered Keli Roberts through the DVD Kickbox Bootcamp, which is one of the 10-Minute Solution series.  I LOVE that workout, but this one I was more ambivalent about.

Despite the fact that I am fit, work out regularly, and take a challenging step aerobics class every week, the step portions of Step It Strong were just too much for me--too high impact and too ""dancey foo foo"" (too many directional changes up and over the step).  About halfway through, I completely gave up on following her increasingly complicated choreography and did my own thing just so I could get some exercise.  Her cueing is not good enough for as complicated as the choreography is and there is no teaching a step slowly before you do it...nor any instructional section on the DVD to help with this.  I kept having to rewind the DVD to the step I didn't catch, pause the DVD, and then step through the move second-by-second to break the steps down so I could figure out how to do them.  Perhaps these are common steps for some people--definitely not in my aerobics class--but then the class I go to is happily NOT ""dancey foo foo.""

In contrast, I quite enjoyed the weight training segments of this DVD and was able to keep up with them.  I loved that her weight training segments aren't the same series of exercises that everyone does.  Sure she does the typical bicep curl and tricep kickback, but she does a lot of more unusual things for the back and shoulders too, and that was fantastic.

Just as a side note for those who are older or have knee trouble, the whole workout is fairly punishing on the knees between the step cardio and the many and varied types of lunges done on and off the step.

I am glad that I rented this DVD vs. buying it sight unseen. On the other hand, I'm actually considering buying the DVD just for the weight training portions.  Because of the ""pick and choose"" menu system, you can just do the weight training workouts or just do the step workouts or you can do them as filmed (an integrated series of step sessions followed by weight training sessions).

If you are looking for an advanced workout and you love the ""dancey foo foo"" style of aerobics, you will no doubt love this.  I would definitely not recommend it to a beginner who is just starting out with exercise.",1139616000,41,2295,4.498795180722891
2289614,5,B0009GV9RI,"This is my 4th Keli Robert's Step Fitness Video that I have purchased and it has quickly become my favorite.  I've been waiting for so long for Keli to come out with another Cardio/Step - Strength Training - as I've been doing the others for at least 5 years now.

As always, her tone and voice is encouraging and her workout is ""quite challenging"" to quote her over the years.  I would probably not recommend this workout for the very beginning stepper as the step routines and moves are definetly intermediate to advanced, but for me, who started ""stepping"" with her very first video with Cher, it was a most refreshing routine.  Her step routines are quick and punchy and you don't have time to dread another move when it's time to pick up the weights.  I LOVE her weight routines as some of them I've never seen or done before (I also do Kathy Smith Step/Cardio as well as The Firm w/Fanny Lifter).  The Abs as always, are challenging and you'll improve with practice.  I know that this video will keep me motivated to work out and I'm sure I'll get the results I'm needing.  On a final note - the music is terrific!  Way to go Keli!",1124496000,44,1137,4.401913875598086
2289635,5,B0009GV9RI,"I have an older vhs tape of Keli Roberts and love it...it is a no nonsense workout for me.  I'm 71 years old and in great shape, weighing in at 115.5 this morning.  I work out six days a week, taking off Sundays.  I found Keli's dvd to be on the same level and love it.  I enjoy her quips as we're sweating... I would definately recommend it, if you're looking for results.",1307836800,2,373,4.068493150684931
2289636,5,B0009GV9RI,I had been doing the Cher workout ever since it came out. Many many years!! It's an oldie but a goodie! This step workout is awesome! I was worried I might not catch on because the routine isn't simple or repetitive. I've done it 3 times and I'm confident that I've got the movements down so I can raise my step and not worry about getting tripped up and falling. I love the toning breaks and the ab workout at the end. This is a very thorough total body workout. Challenging and interesting and fun. And Keli gives very clear instructions and has that great personality to keep you going when it gets tough!,1304035200,,608,4.342105263157895
2289637,3,B0009GV9RI,"I was feeling sorta nostalgic when I ordered this because my very first home exercise video, close to 20 years ago, was by Keli Roberts.  I've graduated to more vigorous routines since then and found this one much too easy for my current fitness level.  Even so, this would be a great workout for the beginning exerciser.  The choreography is basic and easy to follow, though it should be noted that those with knee problems might have difficulty with the number of jumps and turns over and around the step.",1280016000,,507,4.611111111111111
2289638,4,B0009GV9RI,"I consider myself an intermediate exerciser-I'm in reasonable shape, but find Cathe etc too complicated re: choreography for me.  Yes, it took me a few tries to get all the way through and learn the steps, but once I did, I really enjoyed the workout and I still look forwards to it when I decide to use this DVD.

What I will say is that as my cardio fitness improved, the step circuits became too easy and did not consistently seem to get my heart rate high enough for me to feel like I was getting a good workout.

BUT, the weight circuits are killer! I really love doing them and they never get too easy, because all you need to do is switch to heavier dumbells.  I always feel it the day after I do the weights sections.

For that reason I hold onto this DVD, and I'll do the cardio sections when I'm not really in an intense cardio mood.",1277337600,,843,4.179012345679013
2289639,5,B0009GV9RI,"I have enjoyed Keli Roberts' workouts since the 1990's.  She has an encouraging personality that inspires me to push myself even harder when I do her workouts.  I also like that she never puts a person down and always remains positive.  For some, including myself, her step sequences take a little bit of time to master.  I don't see that as a problem.  If you feel that it is challenging at first be patient with yourself you will get the moves down within a short period of time.  Also, if you don't feel strong enough to complete everything, do what you can.  Your strength will improve as you go.  I always feel a great sense of satisfaction when I complete one of her workouts.  They are challenging.  I like the Step-It-Strong format because it balances step routines with weight lifting sequences.  It adds an interesting change of pace.  The abdominal workout at the end of the DVD is fantastic.  I have seen a big difference in my overall strength and physical condition since doing this exercise program.  (I've lost several pounds, dress sizes,and inches.)  I began the program with 3 and 5 pound weights.  After several months, I am now working with 8 and 10 pound weights.",1269993600,2,1185,4.6521739130434785
2289640,3,B0009GV9RI,I liked Kelli Roberts training with Cher a lot better.  Especially for beginners.  Is there any way to get Cher's training on DVD?  Even though it is older?  This Step It Strong takes a lot of practice to keep it up.  It's a good work out if you can keep up with it all especially at the end.  I like the interval training part of the video which helps break everything up.,1269561600,,373,4.111111111111111
2289641,4,B0009GV9RI,"I've been doing step aerobics with Keli Roberts through a VHS tape (and Cher) for years.
So when the VHS player died, I really felt ready to get another Keli Roberts workout DVD.
So I purchased this. I tried it the first time and was only able to get through 30 minutes.
She continues to use basic step aerobics, but has really ""stepped"" them up!
I was transfixed watching the TV to see what she was doing because there is a lot of detail AND the steps were not just happening naturally.
I have great faith that once I ""practice"" this 3 or 4 more times - I will succeed and enjoy this moderate-to-advanced work out.",1268524800,,615,4.310344827586207
2289642,1,B0009GV9RI,"I liked Kelly Roberts  when she first came out with her step and weights vhs. This one is too much information in a little amount of time to follow. There is no review and therefore confusion is hard to follow.
I can do all the moves and I can lift all the weights, but the sequences on the step are too fast and furious.
Is it possible to get a suggestion for a different CD? Can I exchange the one I have now?
Thank you  for your understanding.

2289643,4,B0009GV9RI,"I have yet to be disappointed with a Keli Roberts workout.  Ever since discovering her on Cher Fitness, I have sought out her best videos and Step it Strong is a great one.  Keli mixes step with strength training and weights for an all-over workout.  I appreciate her little attempts to be funny and encouraging.  I really appreciate that she is one of the better aerobics instructors at cueing, in my opinion.  She has an overall attitude and persona that I find very personable and encouraging.  Denise Austin drives me crazy, but Keli Roberts makes me enjoy my workout.",1232236800,2,572,4.7272727272727275
2289644,4,B0009GV9RI,I thought it was but it is not.  It is hard to get in the swing of things not the videos fault but mostly user error.  I will keep pluggin away at it maybe I will be able to follow along eventually.,1221436800,,198,3.6904761904761907
2289655,5,B0009GV9RI,I love this step workout. Lots of fun. You can do it with the weights or without.,1219968000,,81,3.823529411764706
2289656,5,B0009GV9RI,"Poor instructions and difficult moves seem to be the theme of the bad reviews here, but this workout is not made for the person who wants to ""master"" it on your first attempt. This workout will last you through many different fitness levels. Personally, I get very bored with the DVD's that ""walk"" you slowly through every move at baby-step momentum, because 2 months down the road, the workout is way too easy and too slow. Not so with this one!

This DVD is definitely tough, and it did take me a few times through it to learn the step routines (so what?), but I have had great results using it (and that's why we do it, right?). The step portions are difficult, and even after using this DVD for 3 straight months, they still leave me winded. The sculpting portions are tough as well, lots of squats & lunges. Great for shaping your legs.

I especially like that this is interval-training. It breaks the workout into segments of step and weight training, with a sculpting, abs, and back portion at the end. I have had better results with interval training than with any other type of workout, and I've tried them ALL!!

Any DVD that can help me take off 20 lbs of baby weight in 3 months is worth your money!! The routines are not difficult once you learn them, and the results are worth it.",1218585600,5,1294,4.428571428571429
2289657,2,B0009GV9RI,"I was hopeful that based on other reviews I could enjoy this workout, however not so much.  There is no queing of the next steps and it moves very fast even for myself who has been stepping for a while.  I was disappointed.",1207612800,,223,4.162790697674419
2289658,4,B0009GV9RI,"As someone who has done step aerobics on and off for 15 years, this was a very solid, well thought out program.  As in all of Keli's ""classes"", the instructions aren't oversimplified or repeated several times, nor does she spend much time going over the moves slowly.  As this may frustrate beginners, you have to appreciate that after you've done the routine 20 times and know it better than she does, you are not bored by the repetition or slow intros.  I reccommend doing the routine at first with your remote in hand, ready to put it into slow motion to get particular moves down, then back up and start that segment again to get your full workout!
Just when you think you are too tired from cardio, she puts you into strengthening.  And if you want only cardio or only strengh training, you can set the menu up that way.
You cannot go wrong with any of her step routines.  They're fun and she and her crew, while smiling, aren't too cutesy.",1199923200,2,945,4.4393063583815024
2289659,4,B0009GV9RI,"I bought this DVD specifically because it included stepping, but I was a little disappointed.  Keli's routines are easier than Cathe Freidrich's, Christi Taylor's and Rob Glick's, but her choreography offers its own unique challenges.  Keli uses unique step moves (like a  triple knee where you jump to switch knees in the middle) without detailed explanation and I had to immediately modify to avoid injury.  I'll admit I'm a klutz, but I'm a klutz who's fairly adept at stepping.

The good news about the step routines is that they're brief and there are only four or five of them in the 77 minute workout.  But I guess that's my other complaint.  The title of the DVD was a little misleading given that the majority of the workout is strength training.

However, I'll stop my complaining here.  What Keli lacks as a step instructor (poor cuing, unique moves) she makes up for as a strength training instructor.  In those sections she absolutely shines because she offers very thorough instruction and safety tips.

Fortunately, the DVD is programmable and one option is to play all the strength sections without the stepping.  So buy a Gin Miller step workout and combine it with Keli's strength training if you want an excellent overall workout.  On its own, this DVD will only give you a good workout.",1192752000,2,1306,4.828828828828829
2289660,5,B0009GV9RI,"I tried this workout for the first time about two months  ago.  I do cardio, yoga, and weights fairly regularly, and was sore for two days after the first try!  I've done Keli's previous step and kick boxing work outs, and was looking to increase the intenisty, in particular on the weight/strength side.  This workout is perfect.  The step segments are simple but intense, and very effective -- I found nothing dancey-foo foo here, except for a mambo cha-cha at the end, which is a fairly standard move.  My favorite thing about Keli as an instructor is that she doesn't dumb down the workouts: she assumes you are capable, and challenges you from the get-go with advanced moves such as push-ups topped off by side plank, but as always provides modifications for beginners.  I end this workout feeling great mentally and physically, knowing I have accomplished a great workout.  After about a month, I noticed a huge difference in  my ability to sustain tough yoga poses, particularly shoulder stand and full back bend, and I've been able to increase the weight during the freeweight segments of this workout.  Highly recommended.",1183680000,2,1131,4.905263157894737
2289661,5,B0009GV9RI,"I cannot say enough about this workout, the step portion is so much fun - it really gets you moving and you can feel the benefits as you are doing it.  I do this one once a week (working out 4-5 times per week with other vids also).  The music is motivating, as is Keli Roberts - I wish she had more videos.  The strength training intervals are also great in that the reps are longer than most videos, but not boring. I use 5-8 lb. weights right now, but am looking to move up to 10lbs soon (except for shoulder work, which for the normal exerciser, requires lighter weights). My hamstrings are always sore after this video and that is hard for me to accomplish at my current stage of fitness.  Do yourself a favor, and get this one - you will be hooked!!",1177459200,,755,4.186206896551724
2289662,5,B0009GV9RI,"I have loved Keli Roberts since 1993, after the birth of my 2nd son. When I turned 40 a few years ago, I looked good so I thought I would take a few years off. What a mistake. I started doing the same VHS tape I did back in '93 and thought ""dummy, see if she has something new out"". So I purchased Step It Strong. I cannot give enough kudo's to this DVD. I feel like a new woman. I still have flab, but it doesnt jiggle hardly at all anymore! I think of Keli's voice and her facial expressions, and honestly, it makes me put my tennis shoes on and get off my butt. I do the first section and follow up with the abs portion of 10 Minute Solution Kick Boxing. I do it at least 4 times a week with lots of uphill walking in between. I still am not the size 8 I want to be, but I feel like it!!",1175817600,2,790,3.7650602409638556
2289663,3,B0009GV9RI,Kelly Roberts is great but in this workout she is very hard to keep up with because she gives little direction on the steps shes doing. This is not for a first-time step user. Will probally take a few times before you get the routine.,1174003200,,234,4.222222222222222
2289664,5,B0009GV9RI,"This video is tough, but fun. I like having room to ""grow"" with videos. I mean, really, how much of a workout would it be if you could do it all the first time through. Sometimes I can't believe she thinks me capable of the things she is asking me to do, but her sense of fun and adorable accent keep me smiling.

8060374,3,B0009GV9RI,"I own 4 other Keli Roberts workouts, this is my least favorite of the bunch.
The queuing for the warm-up and step sections are non-existent, the weight-lifting intervals work multiple muscle groups but the combined compound movements often require a change of weight mid-interval.  The workout is tough, not for beginners, but should be mastered within several run-throughs.
I have been working out at home for over 25 years, have over 70 workouts in my collection, and have done so many better workouts than this.  I find it a challenge but not an enjoyable experience.  The step section is not dancy and doesn't flow well.  The weight section is not varied enough and calls for weights that I don't feel the average exerciser could control with good form or for the full number of reps.
If you're looking for an alternative to The Firm, keep looking.

You can either do the interval training that way or use the menu to do only the step or only the weights.  The music is great and the moves are fun.  I'm not very coordinated so I learned the moves first without using my step and then added that in.

The only two issues I have with this DVD is a) the weight lifting is beneficial but isn't enough to produce the muscles the ladies in the DVD have.  You would have to do a regular weight lifting program to get results they have, and b) the menu allows you to choose your individual workout, but the weight/strength portions are still spread into different segments, so I still have to click on my remote multiple times to do all the strenth portions alone.
