I have trained and lived with Master Zhang Luping. He encouraged me to move beyond what he had taught me (or any teacher), to discover new things and not to be afraid of putting myself out there. Luping honored me by choosing me to demonstrate and teach tantui kungfu with fajin power at Jou Tsung Hwa's annual tai chi farm in upstate New York. I hope you will learn from my dvd and find the courage to put yourself out there. Please check out my youtube -taichijohn999- videos and samples of tantui kungfu and judge the quality for yourself.

8328087,1,B001NXC02Y,"Having studied Tan Tui a number of years ago with a protege of Master Zhang Luping, I had high hopes of finding a reference that would help in my recall of the art as I started practicing again. I have no qualms about the low production values, extraneous ambient noises, and so on...but the poor quality of performance and instruction on this DVD practically defies description. I personally would have been embarrassed to have offered this product publicly, especially at such an exorbitant price.",1240963200,3,499,4.9523809523809526
