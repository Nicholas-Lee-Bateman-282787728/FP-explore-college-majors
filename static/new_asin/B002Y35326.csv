8711417,5,B002Y35326,"I watched this video at LEAST 20 times when it first came out, I had to keep borrowing it from the local ADA library (in the olden days they either didn't sell these types of videos or they were way too expensive).

Anyway, this 30-minute video changed my life. Tom Parks is a comedian with Type 1 Diabetes, and the video ""portrays"" a normal day in his life; meeting with his agent, hanging out with his friends, going to the dentist...all while living with a serious chronic illness.
Sounds REALLY boring, right? Because of Tom's sense of humor and his charm, as well as the information contained in this video, it's so darn entertaining that you won't even realize that it's 'good' for you to watch it.

Because Tom is actually diabetic, you see many real-life situations that you would never see in a typical 'disease of the week movie'.I was shocked to see Tom actually testing his blood sugar on his monitor; as a recently diagnosed diabetic that meant so much for me to see that he also did what I had to do several times a day. He goes to the dentist who explains the importance of dental hygiene in controlling your blood sugars (which happens to me also!) and in another segment he goes on a walk with a friend but has to cut the walk short because his blood sugar level went too low. He also explains why it happened, what to do about it and how to prevent it from happening in the future.

A really fun part of this video is that most, if not all, of the actors and athletes that appear are diabetic themselves. Because I saw it so long ago I can't remember who was in it except two actors who are sadly no longer with us-actress Dana Hill and comedian Taylor Negron who was very funny as an irritated waiter

Obviously I highly recommend this video for diabetics BUT I also recommend it for friends, family and colleagues of these diabetics so they can get a glimpse into what their friend/family member/colleague go through having this disease. I think that the way the video presents the info may help non-diabetics to not feel afraid to ask for more info or if there's any way they can help.

There's a lot worse ways to spend 30 minutes!",1445644800,,2153,4.4267676767676765
