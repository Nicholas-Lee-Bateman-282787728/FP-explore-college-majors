698957,5,630361082X,"I used this video when it first came out and it was the most fun I've ever had with a workout. It was dance-y enough to enjoy but had plenty of moves to keep my interest, and it wasn't circuit training which I hate!  After a couple of months of just using the beginning level, I was able to run a mile without any problems. Since I have a bad habit of quitting running for months at a time, I need something to build me up enough to run without hurting myself and this is the only thing that's worked. I plan on taking this to a local store and having it transferred to a DVD so I don't have to buy it again because I'm going to use it for years to come.",1232236800,,654,3.8805970149253732
698958,5,630361082X,"I bought this exercise video soon after its release. I purchased a second copy not long ago. 'Nuff said?
I used and abused my first one so much, it got up and walked away! After a brief hiatus from exercising, I suddenly couldn't find it. Now I am enjoying my second copy and loving every minute!
If you are a beginner or like a more advanced workout - this tape offers something for everyone. The direction is clear and precise. The nutritional information is invaluable and relevant. The realistic self-esteem boosters are exceptional. The warm-up, cool down and ab section are fun and challenging. The actual aerobic portions are upbeat, not too complicated and more original than any tape I've used yet and I own many. All of this packed into ONE exercise video is extremely hard to find!
I highly recommend this workout!",1045699200,8,825,4.736111111111111
698959,5,630361082X,"I first obtained this workout video by renting at a local video store in 1997. Each time my days expired on the rental I renewed. This went on for about a month. The workout was at a pace for my beginner skills and I could increase my workout when I felt I was ready. Finally I asked the clerk at the rental store to order the video for me to purchase. I lost a total of 30lbs. I have let friends borrow the video and the responses are always positive. Well, here I am 4 1/2 years later & my video finally ""gave out"" but because of the joy I get from it as well as better health I will be purchasing another. For those that want to start and/or continue a program that will help the ""Mind, Body and Soul"" add this to your video library!!",998956800,8,737,4.020408163265306
698960,5,630361082X,Even though this tape has been around for a while the basics are there.  Florence offers excellent cueing and the workout allows you to increase the intensity  so that you can use it as you progress through your levels of fitness.  Its a shame she didn't make more videos.  Its inspiring to see an beautiful black woman with such a great body.,995846400,2,343,4.483870967741935
698961,5,630361082X,"I have used this video for years, and I continue to enjoy it.  Flo-Jo is very inspiring in this video (especially when she shared her pregnancy picture).  The music is great and the setting is very relaxed.  Flo-Jo has been one of the people that I've most admired over the years, and working out to her video is a great way to continue to be positively motivated by her.",972777600,3,371,4.3478260869565215
698962,5,630361082X,"This is the video for people who have 2 left feet.  Flo jo walks you though all the moves and offers dance combinations that won't trip you up.  The music is great and her personality is the best; you will fall in love  with her.  If you do the warm-up plus program one and two, you will sweat  and even enjoy it at the same time!!",916617600,3,331,3.9545454545454546
7852421,5,630361082X,Can't go wrong with Flo. This is a fun tape to do with friends. I remember working out to this tape back in 1997. I was in the 5th grade and I loved working out to this with my sister. Someone gifted me a vhs player for Christmas last year so I decided to purchase this tape. It plays well. Just wish it was on DVD.,1506902400,,315,3.787878787878788

7852426,5,630361082X,I owned this tape years ago and got in great shape with it and unfortunately misplaced the tape.  I have tried a few other workout tapes and decided to replace the one I had as nothing has worked as well as this one.,1425859200,,216,4.023255813953488
7852427,5,630361082X,"I love this video, it easy and fun, you can relate to the people with her.  I wish it was on DVD.
this is the best exercise video I have ever owned and I own several.

RIP FLO",1398211200,,175,3.5789473684210527
7852428,5,630361082X,"This is an amazing work-out tape, even if you are in bad shape. She makes it very easy to learn the steps and follow along. Flo-Jo is very motivational and I love the ab work-out at the end. I first purchased this tape 10+ years ago. I misplaced my original copy when moving and just had to have another. I only wish that it came in DVD.",1317513600,2,337,4.044776119402985
7852429,5,630361082X,"I have been using this tape for ten years and it will always get me out of a slump.  It is fun, encouraging, and enough of a workout to make me feel good not tortured.  I would really like it on a DVD so I could use it for ten more years.",1294963200,2,238,3.5576923076923075
7852430,5,630361082X,"Back when I was 10, which was a decade ago, my mom and I would set aside time to exercise with Flo-Jo and the workout crew.  Ten years later, I'm finding myself doing the same routines; this tape will forever remain a great way to exercise while having fun.  I've memorized almost all of the routines.  I enjoy how Flo-Jo talks to you, gives you positive reinforcement, and sees if you can talk back as if she's training right there with you; in other words, she attempts to relate to you. Ever since I watched the tape, I enjoyed the people behind Flo-Jo, especially the first two girls in front.  Personally, they reminded me of grown-up versions of my then best friend and myself and I always thought they were really cool, for lack of a better term, and that I wanted to be like them.  In any case, I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to invest in a positive and rewarding workout.  Good house/new age workout music, too... reminiscent of the 90s, needless to say!",1258329600,,981,4.48314606741573
