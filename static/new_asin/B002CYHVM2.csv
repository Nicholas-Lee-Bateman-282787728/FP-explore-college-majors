3907392,1,B002CYHVM2,"I like some French films: this film has too many gaps in logical flow, too much irritating interference by the director, and the resolution to the key mystery is missing.  It begins with detailing the existential angst of the main characters who spiritually and emotionally suffer as they battle with life itself and familial responsibility: very French, perfectly fine. At the outset it is revealed there has been a crucial act by one family member against another that changes the course of their lives; but the reason for the act is never resolved, although the effects of the act are the main current of the plot.  The director interferes by 1) occasionally using ""telescope"" shots where all of the screen is dark except for a circle, but it is random and not used to any effect or point  and only used for a while and then abandoned; 2) sometimes the characters speak directly to the camera and narrate, sort of, but sporadically, to little useful effect, and at one time some unknown person is narrating nothing of consequence; and 3) freeze frame Christmas card shots.  All little director tricks, but used as ""hey, here is a little trick!"" instead of, ""this will help the story.""

At one point the 7 year old twin boys put on a Christmas play with the help of their mother and their dim witted older cousin: the play is the story of a man who was ostracized by his community because he had sex with a goat, but he is forgiven after his arm is torn off in punishment. The play is performed in front of the Christmas tree on Christmas Eve, while the family sits, smoking cigarettes, and watches, grandpa providing musical accompaniment on the guitar, and the grownups enthusiastically applaud when the arm is torn off and the play is over.  What????

Catherine Denueve is naturally worth watching.  I had very high hopes for this movie.  The ending is inexcusable, providing no resolution to the main mystery presented in the beginning, but instead ends with a fuzzy illogical trick ending.  This film could have been so much better.",1261958400,8,2039,4.71830985915493
3907393,4,B002CYHVM2,"An eccentric French family reluctantly gets together for the holidays in ""A Christmas Tale"", directed and co-written by Arnaud Desplechin. Junon Vuillard (Catherine Deneuve) has cancer that could be treated with a bone marrow transplant. So, her three grown children and their children will bring the news of who is compatible with them when they all visit for Christmas. That will not be the only usual event this year: Henri (Mathieu Amalric), the family black sheep, will be joining them in spite of being banished by his sister Elizabeth (Anne Consigny) six years ago. Cousin Simon (Laurent Capelluto), who has a shine for youngest son Ivan's (Melvil Poupaud) wife, will also be there. And their father Abel (Jean-Paul Roussillon) will try to hold down the fort.

For two-and-a-half hours, Junon contemplates her transplant; Elizabeth makes it clear that Henri is so contemptible that she suffers to acknowledge his presence; her son Paul (Emile Berling) may or may not be mentally ill; Ivan, wife Sylvia (Chiara Mastroianni), and Simon dance around one another; but Junon and Henri do not. Mother and son detest each other, and they say so. These people are neurotic, but their unusual talents give them some texture. They are a family of writers, musicians, and mathematicians. This is a typically French film in that the behavior is not intended to make much sense but is there for us to look at. If that's all there were to it, I wouldn't like ""A Christmas Tale"". But the characters are more appealing than their actions are interesting. I enjoyed watching them. In French with optional English subtitles.",1259884800,5,1613,5.018656716417911
3907394,4,B002CYHVM2,"[4.5 stars] It may be a mistake to call this a ""dysfunctional family Christmas movie.""  The individuals of the Vuillard family have, in fact, all submitted themselves to the precise roles that will allow the family to function.  And that is the real problem.  Each has to contort himself, at times almost beyond human recognition, in order for things to make a certain sort of sense.  There is distance in how they address each other: no ""maman"", no ""papa"", just first names all around.  The system that allows this family to function even includes ""Anatole,"" an imaginary wolf that lives in the basement.  It is a well-honed system.

The mother, father, three siblings, assorted cousins and spouses that populate this family tree all have a psychic tie to a withered root, namely the firstborn son, Joseph, who died of a rare cancer at age six.  Elizabeth, the oldest surviving child, complains of a grief that has no apparent source.  She is the type of person we all have met at some time in our lives, someone whose main grievance is that she feels herself to be inadequately aggrieved.  She completely surrenders herself to the false martyrdom of self-pity, willingly clutching each grudge to her bosom, even as it drains her of life and poisons everyone around her.

We see how Henri, the middle child, becomes Elizabeth's chosen victim, and Ivan, the youngest, tries to mollify everyone.  All of this has a decidedly theatrical effect.  The family members are depicted as performers just as much as the Ekdahls are in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fanny-and-Alexander-Special-Edition-Five-Disc-Set-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000305ZYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fanny and Alexander (Special Edition Five-Disc Set) - Criterion Collection</a>, with whose first 90 minutes A CHRISTMAS TALE bears more than a passing resemblance.  This masquerade also has, as a point of reference, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, both in the brief appearance of the 1935 movie on the TV screen, and in Mendelssohn's incidental music, playing on the soundtrack.

The directorial style of this film is something all its own.  It uses film grammar from every era of cinema history, throwing it all into one big pot.  Somehow it works.  I kept thinking of Harold Bloom's assertion that ""strangeness"" is the quality that distinguishes lasting works of art.  There is the  strangeness that so assimilates us that we no longer see it as strange:  Shakespeare, Griffith, Hitchcock.  And there is the strangeness that cannot be assimilated: Sterne, Beckett, Buuel.

A CHRISTMAS TALE possesses the latter variety of strangeness.  You're not going to pull this out and watch it every holiday season.  But you may choose to see it repeatedly for the fascinating, dreamlike dance in the interaction of its characters.",1259712000,24,2829,5.360544217687075
3907395,5,B002CYHVM2,"Finally! this movie is available on DVD.  Certainly the best movie I saw in 2008.  Why can't Americans make films as good as this?

3907396,5,B002CYHVM2,"French director Arnaud Desplechin's film works as one of the best mult-layered movies of the genre, which in many respects takes its conventions and turns them on their head.  Not your feel good, holiday coming home movie but one which inverts and mischievously perverts viewer expectations and instead dares to substitute real people for the usual suspects. The first rate acting (the legendary Catherine Deneuve and the not as well known but no less talented Desplechin actors Mathieu Almaric and Emmanuelle Devos) takes a conventional genre situation - mother (Denueve) suffers from cancer and needs a bone marrow transplant - and explores the generational conflicts that afflict this family and provocatively and evocatively deals with the issues of mother love; forgiveness; sibling rivalry; grief for thwarted dreams and life changing losses, and even fidelity itself.  For film lovers who enjoy characters in unconventional situations, this film will continue to reward upon future viewings.  Those requiring conventional Hollywood plotting and endings should probably look elsewhere. I would add that the director is one of the best working today. One of the best films of 2008.",1257379200,24,1186,5.434782608695652
3907397,5,B002CYHVM2,"This one is not for everyone. Most people will probably not only have trouble with its length, but its style, as well. Both as wild as it is imaginative, Christmas Tale is like a post-modern jazz score, mixing elements from a variety of cinematic styles that are jarring (at times), but always interesting to behold. As long as the film is, it always keeps moving and changing before our very eyes. What makes its odd stylistic combinations work is the compelling depths of its explorations into family and the bonds the unite, or divide us. Like and The Royal Tennenbaums, with a nouvelle vague twist, the film is not only full of odd combinations of image and music, but seems to jump from one film to another from scene to scene, as if each character or emotional quality (from light comedy to serious drama) were each receiving its own rendering. At times, the characters turn and speak directly to the camera. The filmmaker also intercedes by providing chapter headings and keyhole views, but, somehow, what could have become a cacophony of chaos, turns into a wonderment of cinema that any real cinephile will be amazed to behold and want to experience again....",1255824000,50,1168,4.787128712871287

3907399,5,B002CYHVM2,"A Christmas Tale
Think the opposite of everything the movie Dan in Real Life stands for with one exception, which is already saying the movie is amazing. A family gathers during Christmas time, the matriarch awaits her families bone marrow tests to see if they are a match so she can live, and the bad boy brother who has been excommunicated returns. As clich as that sounds the only thing clich is the title and to refer back to Dan in Real Life the only thing real is the real in that title. In keeping it real the film's complex characters have role ambiguity and viewers are left with an open ending. The only thing in Tale wrapped with a bow are the presents.
Oh, however, Dan in real life had the beautiful Juliette Binoche (also in this years amazing Flight of the Red Balloon) and Tale also has many beautiful and talented French actresses that could make any act seem classy. The cinematography is also attractive as is the score.

Speaking about the score mp3 download of the soundtrack from this very site is over three times cheaper.
A christmas tale was one of the best films of 2008 and this one of the best soundtracks.
Most of the songs are classical style but track 20 is a french/rap track.

Deneuve can do no wrong at this point and she is at her blas best smoking like a chimney while seeking a bone marrow donor from among her relatives. Or is she?

It has a long run time, but feels very short when you get sucked into the family drama.  The film has a very European attitude, a la pulling the plaster straight off, without worrying how it feels.  The dialogue is frank and realistic, and the interactions between the characters is heartfelt and genuine.  The actors are all brilliant in their roles, especially Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, and Emmanuelle Devos.

3907407,5,B002CYHVM2,"This film is about taking risks in life even when losses have been experienced. It is about love in a family where disappointments are inevitable. The effect of the loss of the first born child upon the elderly parents, adult siblings, and younger generation in this film is real, touching, sad, and yet comedic. The comedic effect draws from its depiction of a family of eccentrics, but it is still touching because the losses experienced are all within the realm of everyday experience.

3907408,4,B002CYHVM2,"""I can't watch the film because it's not in English?""

Despite the name, and the premise of the movie being a Christmas family gathering, this is no holiday film.  The family in question could be called quirky, but that would bring to mind ""The Royal Tennenbaums"", and this family is not that one.  What we have is a long, slow moving, talking picture.  Not the sort of talking of ""Long Days Journey Into Night"" where family members take turns coming on to stage to scream at each other.  No, this is a slow moving river of a movie---it keeps moving, it moves with subtle but visible force, and for most people who can sit still for over two hours, it brings you along with it.

Deneuve is the original toxic mother, apparently having a gene that not only sets her up for a pair of fatal diseases, but she passed it along to her first born, who then died at the age of 6, taking the lives of his family with him, but leaving them among the living just the same.  In one great scene, Deneuve admits to her middle son, the only one compatible with her in terms of bone marrow, that she never really loved him, or any of her children, aside from her only daughter Elizabeth, and even that love is conditional, and Elizabeth is a self-martyred wreck of a woman, the opposite of her beautiful if domineering mother, who just the same manages to drag everyone around her down.

Despite the subject matter, and the seriousness, this isn't a depressing movie, at all.  I didn't find myself arguing about the arguments (as I do in most dramas, where they seem to exist for no reason but to create drama when the playwright couldn't figure out any other way) nor was I prone to errands or other tasks to fill in the gaps.  Like I said, the movie keeps right on moving, never drags, pretty much always takes the viewer in and carries him along.

All said, it's not going to be for everyone.  We live in an era where talking films exist almost entirely in the past, in a vaunted canon of Classics.  Even serious films these days have some gimmick to move the story along, or take on a complex subject through the most simplistic of approaches.

If you like a good drama, which like life, isn't always dramatic and occasionally even makes you chuckle, this film is for you.

3907411,5,B002CYHVM2,"This is not 'A Wonderful Life'!

It's not even 'The Family Stone'. I first saw 'A Christmas Tale' on IFC a few years ago, turning it on (about an hour into its two hours and thirty minute length) about midway through. Within minutes I was absorbed into the family of Hernri, Junon, Abel, Elizabeth and the triplet of Ivan, Sylvia and Simon-as well as puzzled by the relations between all of them. I watched until the end and immediately looked to see when it would be played again, hoping that seeing the part I missed would help me make sense of what I'd seen. It didn't help much, but I fell more in love with the family Vuillard; as Sylvia says, 'A family of weirdos. The Vuillards are a strange lot...You claim to be ordinary...Elizabeth wrote five plays. You all read music. You all play instruments... Even my kids write plays. The Vuillards pretend they're normal and they're not. That's weird.' Everybody seems to accept this, except Elizabeth, (the only daughter)  who has put the blame for all her unhappiness with life on eldest brother, Henri, an alcoholic wastrel. Wanting a normal life with her husband, six years earlier she seized a chance to be free of him forever, by banishing him from the family,. Having written that, I make this sound like a much more serious film than it is., although Abel's reason for the gathering of the family for Christmas celebrations, Junon's need for a bone-marrow donor, is not exactly a joy-filled one.

Held together with beautiful music, although I must admit that without a soundtrack list in English I can't identify all the selections, the days of reunion pass by-and if you've ever visited a friend's house for a holiday, you might feel right at home, while siblings both young and old race around. Brothers-in-law quarrel, old friends stop by, the family attends Midnight Mass. The youngest children put on a Christmas play. The tree is decorated, the fireplace blazes merrily, Music favourites are played on a record player. Old resentments are brought out, looked over, put away.

I prefer my Christmas-time movies to be one of two types: Unabashedly sentimental, the way 'It's A Wonderful Life' and 'The Family Stone' are or where Christmas is part of the story, but not all of it. 'Hi-Life', 'Ronin', and 'About A Boy' are examples of the second category. 'A Christmas Tale' falls somewhere between the two, giving me a sentimental story for the holidays, as well as an absorbing one about people whose lives I want to know more about. When the film is over and the credits roll, I want to know what happens to Henri and Faunia, Sylvia and her boys and the rest of the not ordinary Vuillards who have captured my heart.",1353196800,,2681,4.722222222222222

3907413,5,B002CYHVM2,"While watching this marvelous film, I didn't expect it would divide people the way that it has.  In my eyes, there wasn't anything to dislike.  In fact, I was so absorbed and so taken by what I was seeing that it quickly shot to the top of my personal ballot for the year of 2008 and, in reflection, I think it may be one of the very best films of the last decade.  Coming to the site to post a review and I was floored to see the negative responses by so many (I say `so many' knowing that that is only appropriated to the lack of reviews, since there are only a total of 19, including my own).  Yes, for every person saying that this is five star worthy (which it is) there are two saying that it is not.

WHAT?!?!?!

Oh well, we can't all love the same things.  Some balk at the `Frenchness' of this film and I say ""give me more"" considering that the French make, by far, the best films ever.  Seriously, when is `French' a negative term when describing a film?  Also, this is a FRENCH film, so why weren't you expecting it to be `very French'?  Yes, this is French in the way it is molded, but it is also a more serious mined French film.  This isn't indicative of the New Wave cinema of the past and so while the scenarios painted and the actions of certain individuals may not feel `American' and may feel `foreign' to us, there is a sincerity here, an honesty that really befits the nature of the film.  This is more comparable to 2009's `Summer Hours' in tone and overall impact.  There is style in the layout and there are moments of flamboyance, but they are tapered to present a more natural and relaxed reality.

The film tells the story of a dysfunctional family reuniting for Christmas after word of the matriarch's cancer spreads.  As told with puppetry, the family had a rocky beginning, and as told in flashbacks, those rocks only got bigger as the family grew.  The tumultuous relationships between siblings spawned divisions in the entire family that lasted far too long.  The reuniting was almost like a rebirth, and while tempers flared and egos manifested ugly heads, the ending result is a healing that the family so desperately needed.

I don't want to say any more.

The acting is exquisite across the board.  Catherine Deneuve is, as usual, the personification of grace.  The way she balances Junon's disappointment with her maternal responsibilities is beautifully rendered.  You never doubt her love for her children, even when she is at her chilliest.  Jean-Paul Roussillon is also wonderful, matching Deneuve's endearing qualities with his own paternal glow.  Mathieu Amalric is brilliant here, building so many layers and delivering a haunting portrayal of a young man abandoned and lost to his own memories of his own failings.  The way he wastes away before his family, casually layering his self-loathing with outbursts of disrespect and aggression is marvelously handled.  A lesser actor could have slipped into clich&eacute;s, but Amalric makes each action feel wholly real.  Chiara Mastroianni and Emmanuelle Devos are stunning creatures, and they create two very different women who circle the outskirts of this family.

A visual feast that is as deep as a well and as compelling as they come, this `Christmas Tale' isn't all roses, but it's thorns give it a poignancy that is not seen in many films `trying' to do what `A Christmas Tale' does with ease.

And why is it that the French are the only ones who understand how to use narration in a way that really serves the film's best interest?",1341187200,7,3531,4.640901771336554

The acting performances are natural and the characters heartbreaking. Their flaws are at once towering and human. I'm a student of film and believe in its potential to teach us something of who we are as we bump into each other in this life. This one teaches from start to finish in some unexpected ways.

It's a visual encounter of lyrical dimensions. And in typical French fashion, its romantic and heartbreaking, yet unsentimental. Admitting my bias for Holiday films, and their ability display family dysfunction not disposed to constructive resolution, this is a film that goes beyond the neurosis and reveals something surprising--plain old good will in some seemingly irredeemable people. Our families often mess us up, but they also have the power to help us heal and bloom from, despite, and because of their influences. This film recognizes that, and makes not excuses for it.

Six years on, all I remember from that movie were its annoyances: an unedited mess, its 2 hour 30 minute sprawl was too long by at least 45 minutes; apropos of nothing, characters suddenly address the screen with three-minute plus, nonsensical soliloquies; a story that hopscotches all over the place and simply causes you to give up any hope of following it; self-absorbed, miserable characters (literally no one is happy in either of these movies); and directorial trickery that only serves to distract.

All that is on display here once again.  Against all odds, this outing is even longer than its never-ending predecessor.  No one possesses the guts to tell Desplechin enough is enough.  The bloat factor reaches its apex during an address-the-camera stem-winder from the usually-likable-but-here-detestable Mathieu Amalric.  It's about five minutes of sheer, pseudo-babble.  There are dinner table scenes in which no one talks to each other.  Not only do these characters not like each other, they hate themselves.  And Christmas only serves to bring this intense self-loathing to a head.  Give me good, old-fashioned self-loathing in public places like Anne Hathaway's brilliant unwatchable-train-wreck-but-I'll-peek-through-my-fingers-anyway-because-this-is-so-good rehearsal dinner outburst in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rachel-Getting-Married/dp/B001E95ZNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rachel Getting Married</a>.  There's nothing about this movie that a little Jonathan Demme couldn't have solved.

8364634,5,B002CYHVM2,"If you are looking for a light, Christmas themed film, this film is not for you. However, this films pulls you in because of all the family machinations, and I felt the need to know what was really going on. The Vuillard family, 2 sons, one daughter,a male cousin, and their significant others and children, are invited for Christmas.

The matriarch of the family, Juno, played by Catherine Deneuve, has a blood disease that will cause her death without a bone marrow transplant.  Everyone must be tested to see who could help save her life. The patriarch, Abel played by Jean-Paul Roussillon, who is in the fabric dye business, tries to keep life and limb together, but it is Junon who  rules the roost. They had four children, though their oldest, Joseph, died of a rare condition when very young.  Elizabeth, the daughter played by  Anne Consigny, is very depressed. She does not remember ever being happy. Henri, played by Mathieu Amalric, is the drunk, and the one not liked by anyone, even his mother. Ivan, played by Melvil Poupaud, seems to be the sane and favored one. Elizabeth's teenage son Paul, played by Emile Berling, has just been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and will return to a sanitarium after the holidays. Here they all gather from Dec. 22 to Dec. 26.

It turns out Henri, the unfavored one, and Paul, the Schizophrenic, both are good matches for Juno and her need for a bone marrow transplant. Henri and Paul bond over this match. Throughout the Four days many issues arise, and the biggest is the banning of Henri by Elizabeth for six years. From my viewpoint, every adult in this family has some sort of issue, mental issues raise their head most often, or blood dyscrasia. This makes for a film full of vim and vigor, and the more you hang in, the better off you are.

8364635,2,B002CYHVM2,"I wish I had read the reviews here instead of judging by the trailer. The trailer makes it seem much more light-hearted, including a two-word excerpt from respected NY Times critic A.O. Scott saying ""Unadulterated Joy"". That sold us when we were looking for a movie, because we could have used some joy this evening. However, in looking at Scott's (positive) review, I find no ""joy"" but rather ""This frantically eventful movie has a plot only in the sense that a child has a fever."" There is no resolution--it's a litany of people behaving badly with each other and to themselves for a full 2 and a half hours. I get enough hours with dysfunctional family stuck in repeating patterns in my own life.  I recommend reading Scott's NYT review in detail, and using that as a guide instead of the trailer.",1464048000,,800,4.633802816901408
8364636,5,B002CYHVM2,"I first saw this film several years ago and remember having liked it.  Via Wikipedia, I learned that this film was in contention for the Palme D'or in 2008.  It's surprising to me that this film, that I'd categorize as experimental, had a broad enough appeal to be up for a major prize at Cannes.  I don't recall having seen other films by the director, Arnaud Desplechin.  But after having seen this, I'm more than intrigued and would definitely check out his other works.

In March of this year I watched ""A Christmas Tale"" once again and was put off by what I perceived to be the ""indulgence"" of the director.  But all great directors have their indulgences which are more than compensated by memorable moments of brilliance.  I came back from 5 week trip to Germany and gave this film at least 2 more viewings.  Something about having been in Europe and away from North America -- Adapted me to the pacing and aesthetics of this work.  Although there's a real time aspect to this film -- The inner lives and remembrances of its respective characters influence the pacing as well.  I was comforted by the craziness of ""A Christmas Tale"", by its patchwork style and its messy / unsanitized look at the life of an unorthodox family.  The classy, yet ramshackle, home of the parents, Abel Vuillard [Jean-Paul Roussillon] and Junon Vuillard [Catherine Deneuve], in which most of the action takes place -- Is an amazing aspect of the set that reflects the contradictions of the people who inhabit it.

The images, editing, score, intimate atmosphere and diverse stylistic elements of ""A Christmas Tale"" create a kaleidoscopic, albeit frayed, tapestry of the Vuillard family -- Who ultimately love each other despite ongoing and unresolved traumas and conflicts.  Although they are seldom successful at it -- They at least attempt to make amends to one another and speak to one another's better nature.  The cast is uniformly excellent and even though Catherine Deneuve essentially plays herself in so many of the films she's acted in -- The bluntness, cruelty and matter-of-factness, with which she imbues the role of Junon Vuillard -- Make her portrayal very effective.  In the end, ""A Christmas Tale"" works as a meditation on life's beauty, mystery, turbulence and heartbreak.
