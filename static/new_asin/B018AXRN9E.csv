8741855,5,B018AXRN9E,"To begin, this isn't the first time I bought the series. There was also the older DVD release from Tokyopop, but the first thing I will say is that this new Maiden Japan release is much improved. It's uncut and unedited versus the Tokyopop release (each episode is shown completely from avant to preview, with the original Japanese text that is translated by the much-better DVD subtitles--credits are translated in a post-episode segment), so I'm enjoying it right off. It has not been re-voiced (which is okay since it was dubbed in California), though the segments that were cut from the Tokyopop release have been dubbed in, too.

Now, to the content itself. While a bit formulaic, it's understandable given the format and timeframe (the 1990's). It's at least different from the OAV, so it's still interesting to watch if you've seen the OAV already. Also, you should go into this with at least a curiosity about Far East folklore and fantasy since this is the basis for the series (this reviewer fits this category). If eastern mysticism interests you, this should pass your time for a modest sum.",1532476800,,1103,4.835978835978836
8741856,5,B018AXRN9E,"I saw this anime on Hulu but it's been removed. I really enjoyed this anime. The animation is not the best, but there's something endearing about that. The anime mostly has ""the monster of the week"" format and is similar to the magical girl genre except darker. Some of the stories have elements from traditional folklore, which I enjoyed. Overall, the series is quite tragic and bittersweet.

The soundtrack is also amazing ! Its by Kenji Kawai. If you've seen the J-horror film, Dark Water, the music is very similar.",1518307200,,519,4.766666666666667

8741858,5,B018AXRN9E,I first saw this anime on VHS - loved it. It has the older animation style but the story is dark but fun to watch. If anyone watched Nightwalker - its similar.,1464652800,3,159,4.0
