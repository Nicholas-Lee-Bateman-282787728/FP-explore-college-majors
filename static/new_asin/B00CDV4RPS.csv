5717011,5,B00CDV4RPS,"The product is complete and is exactly like the prior versions, disregarding the case design. Very good series. Audible languages are English dub and Japanese. You can choose no subtitles or English subtitles. List of episodes inside leftmost case interior. Some discs have bonus content. Only complaint is the ugly green stripe on the outside, but for the price, and being virtually the same excluding that, it is worth the trade off.",1440028800,,435,5.055555555555555

5717015,5,B00CDV4RPS,"Another wonderful 4th season of mystery cases and a young 10 year old boy solving each mystery!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) if you have NOT seen season 1 or 2 or 3 or read my review on Season 1 and 2 and 3 its not problem! here is a quick recap. Jimmy Kudo aka Conan Edogawa is a brillian detective who can solve any case! One day Kudo gets poisioned and now is a little boy again solving cases with his girlfriend who dosnt know he got turned into a boy and her father who is a detective but not a very good one. Conan has some friends along this time in the Jr. Detective league. They don't solve Murder cases but others ones they do!

Pros: great writing again! each case is different, its one hell of an amazing series!!

Cons: nothing really!

Over all: buy this series!!!!",1430611200,,794,4.23841059602649

5717030,5,B00CDV4RPS,Case closed is one of my (if not) favorite animes. I really hope funimation decides to dub more episodes.

The discs in this box set arrived in perfect physical condition though.,1375142400,,355,4.313432835820896
