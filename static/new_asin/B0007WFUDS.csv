Great.",1426636800,,79,4.714285714285714
8052572,4,B0007WFUDS,This biography is a wonderful way to start a lesson on any Tennessee Williams play. Would pair perfectly with The Glass Menagerie.,1362268800,,130,4.954545454545454
8052573,5,B0007WFUDS,"This dvd, originally a 1998 episode of the television series ""Biography"", gets five stars mainly becauase of the snippets of rare newsreel and television interview footage of Tennessee Williams, and for the comments by several individuals who knew him personally.  It's main problem is being far too short to fully cover his life and career, surely Williams deserved the ""special"" two-hour format that is only occasionally given to profiled subjects.  This program is, however, well done and sympathetic to Williams and if it passes over periods of his life and his triumphs a little too quickly, it's all covered as best as one could hope for in an hour format.  A highpoint of the dvd are several clips from an 1981 interview special program made by a New Orleans television station which looks to be the best television interview Williams ever did; what a shame that whole program wasn't included as a bonus feature.  Hopefully, one day it will surface as a dvd release of it's own.  Despite some misgivings, this is an excellent abbreviated overview of the life and career of America's greatest playwright.",1310688000,,1110,4.978378378378379
8052574,5,B0007WFUDS,"This was a fascinating story of the man behind the plays we so much enjoy reading.  It saddened me to see how harsh the critics had become toward him during his later years.  This biography also reminds us to be kind to our children; actually, be kind to all! It also serves as a warning of what alcohol can do to one's career and mind.",1286668800,,336,4.153846153846154
8052575,4,B0007WFUDS,"I'm familiar with many of the film adaptations of Tennessee Williams' works and recently saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BABY-DOLL/dp/B000EBD9SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BABY DOLL</a>&nbsp;(1956) (didn't care for it), his only actual screenplay, but knew little of this playwright/poet's life.

For example, until A&E's TENNESSEE WILLIAMS: WOUNDED GENIUS, I wasn't aware that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-GLASS-MENAGERIE/dp/B00007L4MV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE GLASS MENAGERIE</a>&nbsp;was a screenplay rejected in 1941 by MGM that Williams turned into his first Broadway success or that ""Menagerie"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SUDDENLY-LAST-SUMMER/dp/B00004TWZH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SUDDENLY, LAST SUMMER</a>&nbsp;were based in part on Tennessee's family life.

In ""Suddenly,"" young Catherine Holly's Aunt Violet wants to have her lobotomized to keep the girl from telling anyone how and especially WHY Violet's son died. In real life, Tennessee's mother forced his beloved older sister Rose to undergo this mind-altering surgery. For the rest of her institutionalized life Rose was in the writer's opinion, ""tranquil"" and very much a zombie.

In this 48-minute documentary, a rare audio recording is heard of Marlon Brando in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-STREETCAR-NAMED-DESIRE/dp/0790729377/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE</a>. There's also a stage soundbite of ""Glass Menagerie."" Brief excerpts of films are shown, but the focus here is on the ""wounded genius"" himself, thus discussion of personal excesses and destructive behaviors are unavoidable.

We see one famous clip where Williams, who's just been released from rehab, appears quite drunk in a David Frost interview. He even declares his sobriety in a slurry, fey manner. It's a tragic moment, as was the author's death at age 71 from choking on an eyedrop bottle cap. Tennessee's younger brother Dakin insists he was murdered, which seems unlikely. Alcohol and barbiturates were found in the room, besides Mr. Williams wasn't exactly a young man on that sad day in 1983.

It's noted as a postscript that all of Tennessee Williams' later plays which either bombed were skewered by critics have in recent years been reassessed. Most are believed to not be as wanting, vague or vapid as originally thought.",1262736000,5,2495,6.808777429467084
