1333014,3,B00003RQP6,"Does anyone know if this set has the large on screen PIP logo that Passport has used in the past? I'd really like to know before purchasing! The logo I'm talking about is quite large & runs much of the complete films (see Passport's editions of Plan 9 & Angel On My Shoulder for examples) & in the past has made the films all but unwatchable. 9/8/06: Thank you to T. Parker for answering my question. I was really hoping ""Midnight Girl"" would have had adequate quality as this is it's only official release.",1156464000,5,507,4.404255319148936
1333015,4,B00003RQP6,"I've long been a Bela buff and caught a number of these on TV while growing up, usually in murky, nausea-inducing prints (with commercials). It's nice to have such a broad cross-section of his films all in one set, at a decent price. Generally better-than-average prints, especially on Devil Bat and Human Monster. It would've been nice to have some of the early Universal material in there, but those are out in other box sets, I think.",1155168000,4,437,4.688311688311688

1333017,4,B00003RQP6,"My DVD suffers from bad sound, but I hope I`ll get hold of another edition. Norwegian Greta Gynt is NOT the cowardly heroine one sees in Dracula 1930 and so forth(Quote from a US critic), but Greta`s Diana Stewart stand up to Dr Orlock a`la a modern Scarlett O`Hara. The film is also brutal and the World seems indeed a not safe place 2 be in this account... All good people are NOT as they are supposed 2 be.....
The film is good, but as I said - my edition isn`t on par of what I`ve been told of other editions of this film. We all know of Bela Lugosi, but u better catch GRETA GYNT(1916-2000) in the films DEAR MURDERER 1947-as the neurotic Vivien - married 2 a man called Lee(humoursely - Vivien Leigh - VIVIAN MARY HARTLEY - got her professional name from HER husband, Leigh Holman) and the Ronald Neame-Hithcock-thriller TAKE MY LIFE 1947 as an operasinger, trying 2 catch a real killer when her own husband is suspcted of foul behaviour.
But this is DARK EYES OF LONDON - the film that MADE her :-)",1074384000,,1005,4.322751322751323

7919423,5,B00003RQP6,This is one of Roan's better dvd releases.  To see Lugosi's Dark Eyes of London with the original British title in place is a treasure.  Great print and all-original.  Mystery Liner is also a great print of a 1934 Monogram Picture.  Recommended.,1298160000,,245,4.761904761904762
7919424,5,B00003RQP6,"The worst movies Bela Lugosi ever made, all in one place.  ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is just as awful as I remember it, none of the other films reach that level of suckage.  We bought this to have it playing in the background during our Halloween party, and our guests loved it.  I only wish there were a way to make all of the movies on each disc play sequentially.",1261526400,,366,4.126760563380282
7919425,2,B00003RQP6,"I was one of the many Classic Horror fans that got tricked into buying this neat,LOOKING set of classic Lugosi films.

Typical of this companies releases,the quality varies from decent to terrible.
And EVERY film has to have the company's logo at the bottom,so no one can bootleg there public domain prints.....gee,thanks!

The set could impress by rarer titles,but since many ARE available on other labels for cheaper prices(and better quality)it's not really worth it.
The Midnight Girl(1925) is the only rarity,everything else has been released on other sets and sold seperately.

The bonus is a documentary on Lugosi from the ""100 Years of Horror"" Box set,but honestly,i'd reccomend that you'd just buy that set.

Not a great set,seek out a MillCreek set if you want Lugosi on the cheap.",1228435200,4,791,5.061538461538461
7919426,5,B00003RQP6,"First off, I am reviewing the Roan release of this movie, which comes on a double bill with Mystery Liner. As is always the case with Roan, the digital restoration is top notch. You will not see a better release of this title, and although it is pricier than the Alpha release, it is the only version to consider. Roan is one of the few companies that give old, forgotten gems the prestige treatment they deserve.

And this film truly deserves the prestige treatment. One thing the old poverty row studios had in spades was imagination, and this title certainly proves the point. Without giving away too much, Bela Lugosi (in one of his best performances for Monogram Pictures) plays an insane con man, Dr. Orloff, running an insurance scam and using a London home for the blind as a front. In addition, he uses the lost, blind workers at this home as his unknowing henchmen. The scenes of this ""home"" must be seen to be believed - kind of a cross between The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and the workshop of Dr. Frankenstein. Dr. Orloff has a ""hospital"" at this home, complete with a huge, black electrical device with pinchers, which when placed in a blind man's ears and fired up, will render him deaf as well as blind amidst hysterical screaming (thus rendering him useless to the increasingly curious police); and a large copper tub, used for placing straight-jacketed victims into for methodical drowning. Creepiest scene: Greta Gynt is shown around the home by Dr. Orloff, and she draws a crowd of blinking, stumbling men, pausing a moment from their endless, ill-defined labor. ""Are her eyes dark like ours?"" asks one of them hopefully, pawing gently at the air around her face.

All very Gothic and very, very creepy. In this film, the blind are somnambulant lost souls in some terrible limbo of wet stone and shadow, always stumbling, groping with their hands outstretched; the nearby Thames is a black, bubbling sludge, thick with dead bodies(the River Styx) and Bela Lugosi, with his horrid grin and black skull cap of hair, the Devil overlord.

Great performances all around, with Hugh Williams as the elegant Det. Holt, the gorgeous Greta Gynt as the daughter of one of Orloff's victims, and Edmon Ryan as the American Cop visiting the Yard. Ryan (Lt. O'Reilly from Chicago) is particularly American, charmingly eager to beat suspects into confessions with a rubber hose, which he seems to produce from a pocket in his coat, and dismayed at the way his English counterpart doesn't simply spray led at every opportunity. In one scene, when he and Det. Holt stumble upon another drowning murder, our ugly American proclaims, ""doesn't anyone get shot in this country?"" Later, after taking a pot shot at a fleeing suspect, he says, ""aw, I missed. But it sure was great hearing the old music box again!"" You gotta love this guy.

Oh, yes. Wilfred Walter plays ""Jake,"" Suffice to say that Walter was a Shakespearian actor from the old vic, and his portrayal of the swollen, teeth-jutting Jake is in the same class (more scary but lacking the pathos) as Karloff's much, much more famous human monster.

Great Bela - Great, moody editing and cinematography - Great digital restoration.

That said,I found this set Horrid and a waste of money. You can find these movies out there in better condition so skip this set!!!!!!!",1188432000,4,270,4.313725490196078

7919429,5,B00003RQP6,As a long time Bela Fan I am very happy with this set.  The quality is fine.  I've watched more than half of them with no problems.  You can't beat $1 per movie.  I look forward to fancy restored dvds in the future but this is doing me fine for now.  Quit whining and watch.,1164067200,8,274,3.909090909090909
7919430,3,B00003RQP6,"This set could be an ideal way for the uninitiated to sample the films of Lugosi and decide if they want to commit to buying more, including better copies of ones presented here.

  First I'll address the logo. I looked forward in dread after reading that Passport always puts logos on the screen in their releases. I expected a large brightly colored emblem, drawing my eye away from the films. In reality it's a rather small faint image that I completely forgot about after the first three movies. In fact, if I had to testify, I couldn't swear in court that it was on every single one, but it probably is. Nevertheless there's no reason for it to be there.

  The first two discs are horrible. Midnight girl is pretty much the same quality you see on cheap editions of any silent film. White Zombie looks just like Platinum Disc's release in their Classic Horror collection. The Death Kiss is the worst of the first disc, with dozens of frame jumps and audio skips throughout. The Mysterious Mr. Wong looks okay, but the background hiss makes much of the dialogue difficult to make out. The pair of Chandu movies are easily the worst quality on the entire set. They look and sound like warmed over crap and that's all I'm going to say about the matter.

  Starting off the third disc, The Dark Eyes of London looks a little better, but it sounded like the speakers on my tv were crammed with cotton. Not hiss this time, just plain muffled sound. The Devil Bat looks the best I've ever personally seen it, but I hope to find a better copy someday. The Corpse Vanishes looks wonderful except for that logo, and the sound is great too. I wouldn't expect to see a better copy anywhere.

  The films on the fourth disc are all passable, although Scared To Death would probably look better if you turned the color on your tv all the way down, since it's main problem is that the colors fade and shimmer, and it's kind of distracting.

  Ironically, the Ed Wood films are the best looking ones in this set, and they occupy the final disc.

  I bought this set for a price that was less than a dollar per movie. Even at that price this wasn't a bargain for me because I had already seen most of these films, and now I'll still be buying them again to get the quality that I wanted. However, for those who are curious and have seen less than half of these movies, this is a good sampler of Lugosi in a variety of roles",1158019200,39,2412,4.382022471910112
7919431,1,B00003RQP6,"Where, oh where to begin? This set is horrible, picture quality varies from bad to worse! Even the few films that are watchable have the Passport logo"" Bela Lugosi Collection"" in the right hand bottom corner. There are a couple of these films that look like historical pieces that you see on the history channel ....when i say bad, i mean reallllllllllly bad! Hard to believe they would even release a couple of these unwatchable gems(unwatchable because of picture quality) on dvd at all, i mean what was the point of releasing this garbage? I wish Lugosi Jr could get control of these films and do them right! For good Lugosi i recommend avoiding this and check out titles by Roan Group(they restore beautifully) or the Navarre Corporation who release Bela Lugosi Estate versions of the dvds. Taking a chance to see ""if"" it might be worthwhile, will only leave you with a box of coasters.",1157673600,87,890,4.711538461538462
