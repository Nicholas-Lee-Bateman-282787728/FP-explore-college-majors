There are a lot of interviews with Darnell Autry (who played w/ the Bears and Eagles before leaving the NFL to go act in gay theatre and Brian Musso who got cut by the J-E-T-S after a training camp many moons ago. Unfortunately, the tape does not include the Rose Bowl itself, which gave NU a serious beatdown at the ahnds of USC and Keyshawn Johnson. However, it's still worth a look if you are a fan.
Personally, I think they should have one for NIU's 03 and 04 season.",1106438400,2,579,4.178571428571429
