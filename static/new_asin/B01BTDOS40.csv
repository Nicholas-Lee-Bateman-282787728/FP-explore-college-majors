7669088,4,B01BTDOS40,"Really a mess, but it's a bouquet of delights none-the-less.  All kinds of philosophical integrity, imaginative wire work, good acting, tons of production value, a few babes sprinkled throughout -- what's not to love?  If you like the trailer, the film delivers exactly that.  If not, don't bother.  It's bucket of silly to a Western mind, but I love this stuff, so everything's forgivable.",1459209600,4,390,5.046875

7669090,5,B01BTDOS40,"This is a classic Chinese Martial Arts flick, so don't expect it to have a linear plot line, as Western movies do.  If you like crazy high wire Kung-Fu, and if you like anything to do with monks and Taoism, and Confucianism, and the Martial Way, and if you like crazy and fun plots, then this is the perfect popcorn fest.  It was definitely fun.",1458950400,6,345,4.292307692307692

7669092,2,B01BTDOS40,"Meh, amusing in parts, disjointed story line, good photography, decent action.  Really just an excuse to put a bunch of different action sequences together.  Not a 1 star but 2 at most.",1458432000,2,185,4.75

7669104,3,B01BTDOS40,"not at all what the previews lead you to expect, more acrobatics and wire work than fight scenes. in fact only about 4 in total film. it was ok as a whole but i didn't pause it when i had to get up.",1465776000,2,198,3.627906976744186

7669113,1,B01BTDOS40,Muddled plot that tries to pack five stories into one film.  No suspense or drama to be found in the cartoonish acting and oversaturated film.  A huge waste of time and money.,1462406400,,175,4.4375
7669114,5,B01BTDOS40,"A paradoxical movie, a life lesson wrapped in humor.  Monk Comes Down the Mountain will appeal to the martial artist and spiritual seeker.  An old Chinese wisdom states, when the student is ready a teacher will appear.  In this movie follow the student preparing himself for the arrival of his teacher.  Magnificent special effects, coupled with beautiful scenery this movie will find a cult-like following just as Bruce Lee.",1462147200,,425,5.115942028985507

7669119,5,B01BTDOS40,"This is a very interesting movie.  It's a radical departure from the standard Kung Fu good guy nonsense.  One of the teachers sticks a sword in his student's back, one ex-monk is obsessed with sex but doesn't realize his beautiful wife is doing his brother and a lot more strange stuff.  This has all the over-the-top bs, flying people, incredible impossible moves, just true junk but photographed really well.  In the end, the message was the same ""everything is everything"" Shaolin temple ""philosophy"", but the path to get there was extremely effective, well done, and entertaining.  On the one hand, it seemed ridiculous and disjointed but the way it resolved itself was truly fascinating.  It was a welcome departure and a good ride.",1460505600,,737,4.951219512195122
7669120,2,B01BTDOS40,"I purchased this based on the trailer and the Amazon 4 star review, but I feel deceived. There is no real plot; just a sequence of random fights. And the fight scenes themselves are not very interesting or inspired. A sequence of loosely connected characters are introduced with either long-winded explanations or none at all. Most of these characters take central stage and then disappear altogether. The characters act inconsistently, and there is no actual character development. However, there is a long speech by the narrator at the end that attempts to convince you otherwise. This film is obviously just a feeble excuse for cobbling together a sequence of flashy but uninspired fight scenes. Unfortunately the trailer does a good job of hiding that from you.",1459987200,5,765,5.079365079365079

8751404,5,B01BTDOS40,"If you enjoy martial arts movies and the use of a lot of wire work you will thoroughly enjoy this movie! The wire work flowed beautifully. Fluid. And I call it wire work due to the fact that the characters  are able to jump incredibly high and fly around when they're fighting while hooked up to ""wires"". Of course you can't see them. The fight scenes were extremely over-the-top and exciting! There is a  beautiful story intermingled with the fighting so it's not just insane martial arts action.",1521936000,,497,4.636363636363637
