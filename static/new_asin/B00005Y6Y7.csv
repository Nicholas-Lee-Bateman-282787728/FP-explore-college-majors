1675822,5,B00005Y6Y7,"I am a fan of old classic movies and found this movie to be a light hearted type drama with some comedy. I also love Bridgette Bardot and thought she was beautiful in this movie. All acting in this movie is superb and typical of older movies. Also black and white movies have a certain quality about them that makes them unique. I grew up as a little girl watching so many black and white '40's, '50s and '60's movie classics because of my father. He was a fan also of Bridgett Bardot and so many others. Great movie to watch if you love Bardot and movies of that era.",1376870400,9,568,4.172727272727273
1675823,4,B00005Y6Y7,"I was twenty years old when the picture was on top of the charts, it is one of the best of its time. Brigitte was so beautiful. Super good.",1337126400,6,139,3.8275862068965516
1675824,3,B00005Y6Y7,"A very young, adorable, and plucky Brigitte Bardot charms in a movie that's weak on plot but provides an admirable reason to see her in very little clothing all at once. Although she never reveals all in this movie, she's still effervescent and adorable, making this a worthwhile endeavor for any fan of hers. (Especially for that climactic stripping scene that manages to be naughty and funny all at once!) However, unless you're compelled to seek out all movies alluding to highly non-specific strip-teases, you're best off avoiding this one if you're not a fan.

The quality of the movie isn't half-bad for something filmed nearly five decades ago either. The sound is clear and the picture fairly crisp.",1330560000,13,707,4.9411764705882355
1675825,4,B00005Y6Y7,A nice (buffed) look at France and ms Bardott in the 50's. Modest but beautiful and interesting to look at.,1272758400,4,107,4.4
1675826,5,B00005Y6Y7,"The airhead reviewer ""drollere"" can't step out of his/her timeframe to appreciate this movie, which shows very well the almost limitless energy and optimism of the early 1960s, a period I lived through and remember very well; it's hard to believe it ever happened, given the severely repressed and depressed state of modern culture. When film makers try to reproduce those times now, all they get is a fake surface, as in the 2003 movie, ""Down with Love"". I'm not saying that ""The Nude Set"" is a great movie, it's not, but it represents the SPIRIT of those times perfectly, and that's why I've watched it several times -- it takes me out of the Baby Bush Repressed Universe.",1068249600,25,674,4.6722689075630255
1675827,1,B00005Y6Y7,"total waste of time. the ""star"" never appears nude, but has various sistah relations with women who do. star also has a somewhat skanky boyfriend, with hipstah cool daddy-o relations with women who do. the women who do, do it sleepwalking, with tired music and tired costumes, hurrying through the sets not because they are nude but because they are embarrassed to be in this movie. bought it thinking, ""oh, hey, shots of paris in the '50's,"" but it's almost all stage sets and cheaply done.",1048032000,7,491,4.72093023255814

7956847,3,B00005Y6Y7,"You want to see the early Brigitte (and bits of 1950s Paris) in action, you see it here. Print only average. Story not very credibnle",1518652800,,133,4.36
7956848,4,B00005Y6Y7,"Dated but fun with the beautiful Brigitte in the cast.  Being from 1957 this shows how free the French were back then as opposed to American Puritanical censorship.  Fun film taking place in and around cabarets in Paris, frolicking and farce and fun.  This is a charming little comedy.",1516838400,,285,4.775510204081633
7956849,1,B00005Y6Y7,"The subtitles are huge and yellow, and you can't really watch the movies with them on.  Very distracting. Returned.",1511568000,,115,5.052631578947368

7956853,4,B00005Y6Y7,Is an okay movie a very old movie when Bardot was young and pretty on her best.,1429920000,2,79,3.7058823529411766
7956854,2,B00005Y6Y7,Its not in color. I watch old movies for the culture they reveal at the time they were made so I realize no one saw it in color but these old movies are so nice to watch in color.  I'm sure it is labeled black and white but anyway...It just didn't grab me,1410998400,,255,3.811320754716981
7956855,2,B00005Y6Y7,Not a very good movie - but memories of BB.  We watched it all and generally enjoyed the silliness and week plot.,1396137600,,113,4.136363636363637
