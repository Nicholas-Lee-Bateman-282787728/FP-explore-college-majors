4888093,4,B005T5OCLY,"This DVD while quite enjoyable did not have enough real bluegrass for me,I think it would appeal more to younger people than myself. The venue was great and made for a great atmosphere so it was good to watch.",1359763200,,209,4.384615384615385
4888094,2,B005T5OCLY,Ricky Skaggs was the only true Bluegrass on the whole dvd and the 2 songs he did were at the very end.  A waste of money and time.,1356480000,8,130,3.642857142857143
4888095,1,B005T5OCLY,"Not what I consider true bluegrass.  Difficult to sit through.  Some might like. It, but i would not buy this again.",1356048000,10,116,4.476190476190476
4888096,2,B005T5OCLY,"The title of this video suggested Bluegrass music but there was far too much other type of music in it.
I was very disapointed in it. I would not recommend it for anyone who might purchase it for Bluegrass music.",1333411200,16,212,4.325
4888097,5,B005T5OCLY,"The bands that played there in the Cumberland Caverns in McMiinnville, TN that day were so amazing that I was totally floored.  The performance by Mike Farris and the McCrary Sisters was the most moving thing I had seen in years.  If you ever get a chance to see a show in these caves, I strongly recommend you do. I plan on buying this DVD and listening to it over and over!",1329868800,,375,4.194444444444445
4888098,5,B005T5OCLY,"This 90-minute DVD from PBS is somewhat misnamed, but still a fine, entertaining performance.

PBS station WCTE in Cookeville, TN recorded a series of concerts in the ""Volcano Room"" at Cumberland Caverns, 333 feet below ground level. The DVD collects excerpts from performances by 10 musicians or bands that best fall under the title ""Americana"". A few are what can best be described as ""bluegrass"", including the well-known Ricky Skaggs and the family group Cherryholmes. Singer/songwriter Darrell Scott and Steve Earle's son Justin Townes Earle (both of who I love) are better classed as ""Americana"". The young band 18 South mixes country and bluegrass, while Will Hoge is closer to rock than anything.

Based on the age of both his appearance and the song her performs, I'm guessing that - even though this DVD is dated 2011, the JT Earle clip was recorded about four years ago. I couldn't identify the others.

The performances were recorded with a live audience and it's sort of neat to see the rocks of the Caverns in the background, but because the musicians are so well miked, I'm not sure it makes the sound any better, or different. There are no real introductions; the performer is identified by a title on the screen. So there's no filler here.

I enjoyed seeing artists I know and love (If you haven't seen the whitest Black Gospel singer ever - Mike Farris - this is your chance!) But I also discovered some new ones.

I - for one - would love to see a follow up to this DVD.

I hope you found this review informative and helpful.

8485817,4,B005T5OCLY,"There is no more unique show on television today like the PBS music series ""Bluegrass Underground"". The stage is located 333 feet below the surface of the ground in a cave. Not some man made set that was built to look like a cave. It's a real freakin' cave and with great acoustics to boot. And every week an outstanding musician or group are guests on the show. The kind of music performed on the show varies a bit and that does provide a bit of confusion for some people. The title ""Bluegrass Underground"" suggests the kind of music you will hear on the show is bluegrass. And occasionally there is a bluegrass group performing on stage. But not all the time. I am sure for those lovers of BG music it can be a disappointment to turn on the show and not hear bluegrass being played.

In fact there are a few styles of music that can be heard on the show from country to folk to folk rock to blues to Americana and yes some bluegrass. I like bluegrass though I am not a big fan of that genre of music so I don't have that problem of other styles of music that can be heard on the show. I have always had an eclectic taste in music that doesn't bind me to listen to only one kind of music. With so many great forms and variations of music out there to be heard nothing to me can be more boring then to limit yourself to just enjoying only one kind of music. And that is why I love the diversity you get here on this program. Still I can see the point of view on the part of bluegrass fans expecting because of the title of the show to hear their favorite kind of music only to be let down that something else is playing. On the other side of the coin however I wonder how many people have not tuned into ""Bluegrass Underground"" because they are not fans of that kind of music and so are missing out on some fantastic singing and playing because they think only bluegrass is being performed. So yeah the title is a little misleading but don't let that stop you from checking it out.

""The Best Of Bluegrass Underground"" spotlights the best moments from the first season of the show. 16 songs performed by ten different performers and of those 10 only really Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder can really be classified as bluegrass. The other musicians appearing down in the cave include Cherryholmes, Will Hoge, Mike Farris and The McCrary Sisters, Monte Mongomery, Mountain Heart, 18 South, Darrell Scott, Justin Townes Earle, The Farewell Drifters and The John Cowan Band. Every one of these performances are first rate and deserve to be included in the DVD collection. Whether you have heard of this program or not or even if you love bluegrass or not you got to watch this disc. It is a top notch production with first rate music that in the end is bound to please.",1459382400,3,2767,4.329479768786127

8485821,5,B005T5OCLY,Who'd have ever thought to have concerts in a cave?  And who would have ever thought that the acoustics would be so good?  There's all of that and then you have some of the best musicians anywhere playing their best.  I'm really enjoying it and highly recommend it to anyone.,1390867200,,275,4.46
8485822,1,B005T5OCLY,Gave this DVD a one because I couldn't give it a zero. This is NOT bluegrass! I am not even sure what genre of music this was supposed to be. Most of the people are unknown. Half of the guests sing out of tune. Couldn't watch it. Please save yourself the money!,1388361600,9,261,4.038461538461538

8485824,2,B005T5OCLY,Most of the musicians are unknown and several not very good.  I bought the DVD because I like Ricky Skaggs and he barely makes it onto the video.  Except for the uniqueness of the venue this video is a no starter.,1384300800,5,213,4.170731707317073
