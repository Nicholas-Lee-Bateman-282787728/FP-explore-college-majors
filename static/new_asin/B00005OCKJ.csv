1640800,5,B00005OCKJ,"I always turn to Rick Steves and his travel guides when planning a trip to Europe. His books and dvds are fun, packed with information, helpful, useful and have excellent travel tips for budget conscious travellers.  Rick himself is always entertaining, full of information and very experienced in helping travellers who want to make the most of their money.  Thanks to Rick, I have discovered some hidden treasures in my travels to France, the UK and Germany - sites that are not as famous as the 'tourist traps' but are enchanting all the same.

These dvds, to me, serve two purposes. Before the trip, they serve as excellent travel resources for planning and getting ideas on what to see and what to do.  After the trip, they serve as a visual memento and souvenir of my visits to these lovely European towns and cities.

I like Rick because he is more down-to-earth and more easily accessible than most travel guides. He really makes a point to meet the locals and recommends sites and accomodations that are budget-friendly but gems all the same.  In all my travels to Europe, Rick has never steered me wrong. Highly recommended.",1172966400,3,1134,4.760204081632653
1640801,1,B00005OCKJ,"Don't become another victim duped into buying a collection of travel DVD's under the impression that they are on par with other brands. The 2001 release date or the fancy cover shouldn't fool you. None of these episodes were shot anywhere remotely near the year 2001. The quality parallels that of your average freshman project in a high school film class. What's worst is a high school TV production project might just be more entertaining.

 The plot of the collection is a simple-minded, middle-aged American male swaggers around the European continent's famed sites somewhere in the late 80's/ early 90's with, what seems like, a home video recorder. Somehow, after the long 10-20 second water-downed shots, exacerbated  by the monotonous elevator music, Steves threw together this ""DVD collection."" With his facetious one-liners and signature blue button shirt with khaki pants, Steves manages to paint a humdrum picture of the very exciting world of international travel.

 Be prepared for many incoherent staged shots with scripted banal dialogue. The ONLY person who ever talks in the DVDs IS Rick Steves himself. No one is ever able to add an interview or sound bite without Rick's voiceover drowning it out. Then adding salt to our aching wounds, he repeatedly plays a repulsive, banausic music. I have actually watched a few episodes on mute out of dread for having to endure the soporific musical hassle inflamed by his layman remarks. Not to mention his humor attempts are reminiscent of Bob Saget.

 If the camera isn't on himself for the 90 minutes than it most likely is a close up of an innocent bystander without him/her aware(e.g. random tourists eating ice cream). The ""travel tips"" are outright futile(e.g. ""how to take a picture"", ""how to visit a tourism information office"", or ""how to neatly pack your luggage"")The technologies used at the time of production are now almost obsolete to the average traveler. For instance, Rick demonstrates how to use a pay phone or how to make a telephone hotel reservation.

The special features atrocious. They`re not even Rick Steves`s own pieces; they're mostly jumbled 80's TV segments of whichever country he visited. The entertainment value ends at a good chuckle and click of the ""menu"" button.

The reasons for a purchaser forking up $120 or so for the entire collection are beyond absurd. If you're serious about enjoying a good arm-chair trip to anywhere in the world look into ""Globe Trekker"" DVDs.
Reasons why Globe Trekker surpasses these amateur videos include:
1. They are up-to-date
2. They include original ambient music(it is actually sold on CDs)
3. The travel hosts vary and are likeable
4. The entire episode is not a spotlight on the host, they actually let others talk
5. The graphics are up to date and modish
6. The entire production exhibits professionalism and successful research
7. You can chose from almost any country in the world; you're not limited to just Europe
8. You'll be hooked from the first episode",1166918400,6,2998,5.004016064257028
1640802,5,B00005OCKJ,"What can I say, if Rick's syle and mode of travel meets your needs, then he is the one to follow.",1120694400,2,97,3.6666666666666665
1640803,5,B00005OCKJ,"I am so happy with this DVD set! I watch a different destination each morning (at 4am!) before I start my day. (Peace time before I wake up my 3 boys and go to work)

There are hours and hours of destinations. I like that he added Portugal, Turkey, Egypt and even Greece. These locations are not usually included, so it's new and interesting information.

The Special Features add even more hours of great information. If you follow Rick's travel tips, you really will have a better vacation! I've been to Europe 5 times, and these techniques will make it easier to get around and communicate with the locals. This will reduce your own anxiety and stress. You can't beat this price, either!",1113782400,6,690,4.6016260162601625
1640804,5,B00005OCKJ,"This is a great selection of Rick Steves shows on DVD, showing some of the msot famous European countries, there are six dvd, Rick Steves makes travel seem easier and exciting and also is interesting how he meets with the locals and explains places history and everything.  he makes it fun like a friend is talking to you.  This is great for any one who is going to travel or who wants to and is unable too.",1083628800,8,407,4.2727272727272725
1640805,5,B00005OCKJ,"The best of travels in Europe with Rick Steves is a 6 DVD set.  Each DVD is about 3 1/2 hours long.

#6 is France visits Burgundy, Provence & the Loire Valley, Dordogne, the French Riviera, Paris, Normandy & Brittany.
All have extra features not included in the main part and also Rick's back door travel tips. It's very scenic and informative for travel planmning or just arm chair travel.  These DVD's are a wealth of information, knowledge and adventure.  Each DVD is divided into segments so you can take a break after each part. The how to section gives tips on money exchange rates, language, places to stay, eat, tourist centers, car rental, packing, plus a whole lot more.  This set is worth the price and I personally loved it.",1078272000,20,1477,5.040983606557377
1640806,2,B00005OCKJ,"Contents were good as advertised, but video quality were real disappointment. I expected DVD level cinematic video quality, but in reality video quality is VHS level. This DVD series is very useful for a tourer who prepares for real travel, but not for a DVD viewer who hopes for DVD quality scenery experience. So be careful!",1017619200,29,326,4.839285714285714
1640807,5,B00005OCKJ,"Rick Steves always makes his commentary seem like he's speaking directly to YOU, the viewer. As he describes the highlights of France, it's as though he is holding your hand through the adventure. Rick also wants you to enjoy the same things as much as he, and only chooses the cream off-the-top for future travelers. In his tour of Paris he highlights the best, but not necessarily the most popular or most traveled places. In doing so, he wants you to have a more intimate experience, and have less fear of trotting around Paris on your own.

One important hint Rick Steves tossed out to the viewers in his DVD, was to ""be polite"", say ""hello"" when entering someone's shop (which usually double as their home). Rick also cautions NOT to try to fumble with the names of monuments and places in ""correct"" French etc. Just be a nice American, not too bold or loud and say ""Merci"". It's doesn't hurt to try to learn a little French before your trip. My husband and I found this very helpful and were pleasantly surpised to find the locals really opened-up when we practiced our limited French, and had some good laughs trying to chat-it-up.

If you haven't travelled to Europe before I would highly recommend reading Rick Steves' travel books along with Fodor's. A little preparation and you won't be sorry. Rick Steves' DVDs can only wet your appetite for more!",1011571200,31,1360,4.6625
1640808,5,B00005OCKJ,"My wife and I are very familiar with this series: we watched and taped many of the episodes on cable TV; we used the travel tips and ""back door"" attractions to plan our own travels and we revisit our tapes frequently, using them a souvenirs. The entire series is friendly, factual, educational and features fine cinematography. All of these virtues have been transferred to the digital medium and...no commercials or breaks for public television fund-raisers!  The travel tips, culture, art and history, architecture and scenery are fine, just like the first time around! This time, you can stop the action and still get crisp images of art and architecture.
Questar adds a minimum of ""packaging."" The slip case holding the set is flimsy weight paperboard and they have ""pumped up"" the musical entry to each disk, but inside this wrapper, all is as it should be.  Questar includes ""special features"":  Rick's ""travel tips"" segment from the first series is repeated on each disk; a couple of ""extras"" are not from the Rick Steves series but are well-narrated and very finely photographed items from a generic series.  Most ""extra"" segments are ones that were originally included in the main programs from each series but no harm is done--Questar's order of presenting the material is logical.
Each destination is given high-quality treatment: there are no ""lesser"" destinations since Rick selects ones he has visited and revisited...and continues to enjoy. The material on Turkey, for example, was a real surprise--we discovered a rich and varied set of attractions beginning with Greco-Roman remnants. The scenery is spectacular.
Rick and fellow travel-writer, Steve Smith, provide thoughtful, well-written commentary and the whole series illustrates the educational value of open-minded travel to a variety of cultures.
You get 20 hours of quality programming (discounting repeats of the travel tips), so the pricing is still reasonable, just as entertainment. If you make use of Rick's insights and tips on places to stay, the set is invaluable.",1006387200,70,2047,5.2317073170731705

7948580,2,B00005OCKJ,We have not watched them.  They arrived just an hour ago and we did watch 30 mins.of one  but the filming quality seems very poor vs.those we have watched on PBS. That is all I can offer to say  and wish to return the product for a refund and will invest in a newer version.,1359331200,2,274,3.9454545454545453
7948581,5,B00005OCKJ,"I have been watching Rick Steves on my local PBS station for years. There was a time that it was not on and I truly missed it. This set is well worth the money. My husband had never heard of Rick Steves until I purchased this set. Now, he is addicted to it. We are constantly watching this. The nice part about this series is: it is not about shopping, or eating. It is about solely about traveling. This is the original travel show!! It is nothing like those that are shown on the Travel Channel today. It gives you good pointers as well as a great overview of the regions that he visits. I plan on ordering more of his series!!!",1358208000,,630,4.172131147540983

Rick Steves is great in these dvd's and I recommend these to anyone who loves to watch beautiful scenery and foreign places tastfully done with good music and great food.
