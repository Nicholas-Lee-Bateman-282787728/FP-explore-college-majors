8702990,2,B00TS7U5OC,"Simply put, I like old movies, even the B ones, but this one was really silly, and not in a good way!  I made a blind buy, and managed to watch it all (it's short) but almost quit several times.  The story revolves around an engaged couple and a group of old Vets, as well as the plant where the sabotage is occurring.  So they tried to mix romance, humor and suspense, which I normally love, but it fell flat.  Plot points often veered toward the ridiculous, even allowing for the low tech crime solving of the day. I did kind of like the end, despite it's implausibility, but it's not nearly enough to redeem the film.  So give this one a pass.  (can't believe this came out on blu-ray, when I'm still waiting for so many excellent films to be released/remastered..)",1518307200,,768,4.373239436619718
8702991,3,B00TS7U5OC,"Sabotage is a 1939 melodrama in which the main character, Tommy Grayson (Gordon Oliver), is arrested on suspicion of sabotage at an airplane factory. His family and fiancee try to help him, but neighbors and factory workers are not convinced of his innocence. His father, Major Matt Grayson (Charley Grapewin, The Wizard of Oz), a watchman at the plant, is certain that his upright, honest son had nothing to do with the incident, which caused the death of a test pilot. With the help of Tommys fiancee, Gail (Arleen Whelan, Young Mr. Lincoln), and a group of his old friends, Major Grayson sets out to prove that his son was framed and bring the true culprit to justice.

There are several similarities to the better-known Alfred Hitchcock film Saboteur starring Robert Cummings, particularly the theme of an innocent man wanted for espionage who has to extricate himself from suspicion by finding the actual culprit. While the Hitchcock film is a stylish thriller with a number of memorable scenes and first-rate supporting performances, Sabotage is a fairly ordinary programmer with a second-tier cast. Back in its day, this kind of low-budget, short (67 minutes) film would play on a double bill with an A picture. With its black and white photography, modest production values, and uninspired direction, the movie resembles an old TV drama.

There are no bonus features on the unrated Blu-ray release.",1485216000,3,1406,5.030042918454936
