7506966,5,B017IXVTHY,"Praise God, for he is more powerful than the enemy, and his love and abundance is everlasting. Give all glory to the son Jesus for him giving his life for us first.

7506976,3,B017IXVTHY,As the rating is Ok,1483228800,,19,3.0
7506977,4,B017IXVTHY,I thought this documentary was interesting and pertinent to the Christian faith and belief in Satan as an enemy of life. It is divided into segments but they all connect in an overall narrative. Not all the questions about Satan were answered but some key ideas were provided for how to better understand 'The Deceiver' and how to better navigate our lives as humans.,1482969600,,367,4.75

7506985,1,B017IXVTHY,Worthless,1473465600,,9,9.0
7506986,3,B017IXVTHY,"I thought this movie was going to go into more depth regarding Satan, how he came to be and his attributes.  It's an OK movie but that's it.",1472256000,,140,4.0
7506987,5,B017IXVTHY,I loved this and it is exactly what I needed to hear at this time in my life. The information was uplifting and accurate. The speakers were very knowledgeable. Many parishioners have no idea what tools are needed to combat satan. I wish more pastors would educate their congregations on this subject.,1471737600,,300,4.788461538461538
7506988,5,B017IXVTHY,Awesome! An excellent reminder of the spiritual battles we face.,1470096000,,64,5.5

7506996,2,B017IXVTHY,I think it had too much wasted time showing someone driving and too much drama and not enough on the subject.,1465257600,4,109,4.238095238095238
7506997,4,B017IXVTHY,I enjoyed this greatly!

7506998,5,B017IXVTHY,Very well done biblically based.  Just what I needed to See and Hear.  Powerful Testimonies.  Highly Recommended.,1458259200,3,113,5.529411764705882
7506999,5,B017IXVTHY,"Watch past the first few minutes.  At first you may think they are saying to look for a demon behind every bush. Not at all.  It is a teaching on the ways we can become blinded in our day to day lives and give Satan opportunities to gain a foothold.  If you continue to watch past the first 5-10 minutes, this film can really encourage you. It reminds us to give God entrance into our daily circumstances by applying practical tools and principles to ward off discouragement, stress, and the tendency to feel overburdened by the cares of this life.",1457654400,5,548,4.46
7507000,5,B017IXVTHY,A documentary well done. Very informative and to the point. Ephesians 6:10-20. As believers we are constantly under attack from Satan. We must equip ourselves everyday.,1457308800,4,168,5.5
7507001,5,B017IXVTHY,I think this is just a good reminder for believers. Its easy to get caught up in the routines and things of this world. I also recommend The Screwtape Letters by CS Lewis and look up Francis Chans rope illustration on You Tube. Very eye-opening as well. God bless.,1455408000,7,264,4.408163265306122
7507002,5,B017IXVTHY,That was great information it had me praying for myself and friends.everyone should see this video.believers and nonbelievers.,1454371200,2,126,6.055555555555555
7507003,2,B017IXVTHY,"I really didn't watch much, it was pretty boring to start.  May go back, but I doubt it.",1453593600,,88,3.888888888888889
8739449,5,B017IXVTHY,I love this short refresher documentary. I watch it whenever I am just overwhelmed or actively under attack. It always reminds me I am not alone in this confusing world.,1519344000,,169,4.666666666666667
8739450,5,B017IXVTHY,"How easily blinded we can become in the spiritual battle of good and evil....
How easily deceived we are in a rapidly changing world. ....when life started to feel like a constant uphill  battle against evil forces beyond my control, i had forgotten to turn to God to help me carry my burdens and & I was trying to fight the fight alone. Trying not to be a burden myself, but this video helPs us get past all that and help us realize we're not alone in this fight. God is more than willing to help us when we ask. We have to forgive ourselves and hand the reigns over to God. Mike Newman....a great guy. I too am from San Antonio. He reminds us  how to utilize God given tools to not to fall into the deception and temptation.",1516233600,,726,4.178571428571429

8739453,2,B017IXVTHY,"I was thinking this was going to be informative on who Satan is, how he became the Devil, and specifics on how he deceives us in our daily lives.  It was too much focus on other things, I would have preferred it stayed on topic.",1504051200,,228,4.066666666666666

8739455,1,B017IXVTHY,Normally like this type of movie... but this one was so poorly produced and presented that I couldn't finish it. The narrator looked and acted like he had just been released from the loony bin. Did not like.,1500422400,,207,4.473684210526316
8739456,5,B017IXVTHY,Watched this at a point where i was facing some challenges in my walk and it gave me just what i needed to get my focus back. Thank You God!,1499040000,,140,3.7
8739457,5,B017IXVTHY,Very biblical and informative!,1497398400,,30,6.75
8739458,5,B017IXVTHY,"I was raised among non-believers, but the lessons of life have led me to the teachings of Jesus and all good faiths. When I see video on YouTube, of people physically fighting with each other over political matters that are out of their control, I am reminded how the dark powers in control and have systematically taken people away from their faith. Our roots are in humility, love, and compassion. Yet, Satan has preached an alternative of individualism, materialism, and dehumanization. He has divided us, and it is not random. It's by design. I'm going to start living my life right. I want Jesus, love and positivity within my life.",1497312000,4,637,4.8
