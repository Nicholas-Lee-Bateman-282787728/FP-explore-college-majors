8030951,5,B0002S6446,"This is almost a primer of European operatic performance history from August 1981 to December 1992 with the majority of the selections recorded in the early to mid 1980's. A wide variety of production styles is shown. Several of the operatic vocalists are at the height of their youthful abilities; Baker, Carreras, Domingo, Ewing, Gruberova, Marton, Rawnsley and Schicoff. Shirley Verrett displays an almost definitive rendition of ""Mon coeur s'ouvre a ta voix"" from Samson Et Dalila with John Vickers as Samson. Domingo shines in two excerpts from Les Contes D'Hoffman. Carreras especially shows his superior abilties in two pieces from Andrea Chenier preserved from the years before his illness and decline. And Maria Ewing may have been one of the first to really depict the toughness and enticing sexuality of Carmen.",1489017600,,822,5.234848484848484
