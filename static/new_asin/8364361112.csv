1170772,1,8364361112,"If you've read the book ""The Manuscript Found in Saragossa"" you know that it starts super strong then devolves into a boorish don quixote book 3 attempt of some kind.  But the opening is so freaking strong its hard not to be impressed (and sadly disappointed when it loses steam).

this movie just doesnt have visual or dramatic power thats worthy of the source material.  If you don't believe me - just read the first third of ""Diary Found on the Road to Saragossa"" and you will realize how mediocre this film is.  The book (the first third or so) is phenomenal 6 or 7 star classic material.",1181174400,5,592,4.453703703703703
1170773,5,8364361112,"Yes, that's right. The running time of this 1965 film is 182 minutes and as is the case with Seven Samurai, not one minute of the whole time is boring. The late Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead fame counted this as one of, if not his favorite film and it's easy to see why.

Adhering to the structure of the novel on which it's based, the film presents the viewer with tales within tales--sometimes as many as six layers deep. For male viewers, it helps that there is an eye-popping assortment of astoundingly beautiful women, but even without the eye candy this is a rare treat.

The original novel on which the film's based was published in 1804 by Jan Potocki and centers on the title work, a seemingly ageless manuscript, as it is discovered by the main character, Alfonso van Warden, a Belgian officer during what then appeared to be the endless series of wars that plagued the European continent in which almost all countries were engaged. He finds the manuscript in Spain, and in Spain is where all the film's action's set. Most, if not nearly all tales that comprise the work contain elements of the supernatural--either ghosts or dead men who reappear as living ones, or demons in the form of alluring women.

Many of the tales focus on men seducing women, or vice versa. The recreation of a culture completely outside that of Poland by a Polish film director is admirable for its day, time, and location (considering that Poland in the 60s was not exactly a wealthy nation), and it's truly odd to see people dressed in Spanish garb speak Polish! Nevertheless, the film is spellbinding, charming, enthralling, enticing, and gloriously entertaining.

When the end of the film seems to come full cycle back to the beginning, the viewer begins to wonder if perhaps all this has been a dream...or if the manuscript has magical powers that defy rational analysis...or if, perhaps, all that we know is fantasy after all.

A marvelous piece of entertainiment, and one that should not be missed by Deadheads, former hippies, fans of the surreal, European film buffs, and those who just plain love film. Brilliant, delightful, mesmerizing, fantastic, and great!",1129593600,17,2158,4.8059299191374665
1170774,5,8364361112,"I just finished the 3 hours that it takes to see this movie.  It was an incredible experience.  I have rarely seen a story so convoluted -- so made up of stories within stories. . .

In the middle of a battle in Spain during the Napoleonic wars, two soldiers from opposite sides are suddenly entranced by a manuscript.  They sit together like brothers, and begin to read the story of a captain of the Waloon Guards trying to cross the mountains into Spain -- over and over again, he has experiences with two  ghosts?  demons?  whatever?  in the form of two beautiful women who express love for him.  Over and over, he wakes up under a gallows with corpses.  Very creepy.  As he tries to get over the high pass for the next few days, we experience with him the stories he tells, along with the stories of people he meets, and stories of people within those stories, and stories of people within the stories of the people who are within the stories . . . . oh forget all that.  This is one movie that just has to be seen to be believed.  It is well worth the 3 hours.  It is hard to explain how a movie can be frightening, funny, mysterious, etc, all at the same time.  So just see it! ADDENDUM - one week later:  I should mention that for two nights after I saw this, I had terrible nightmares.  Then, a few nights ago, my husband finally saw the movie, and had the first terrifying nightmare of his life (in his dream, he woke up under the gallows where the hero is often awakening in this film).  So, those of you who are familiar with the story will understand just how disconcerting that may be -- given the role of dreams within this movie.  So, I wanted to add that you should only see this movie if you can handle that it attaches itself to some deep architypes, and may have distressing effects!",1106956800,23,1802,4.262536873156342
1170775,5,8364361112,"I adore this film. It is made by a Polish director with Polish actors based on a Polish novel but the look of the film is decidedly Spanish surrealism. Its a film best watched late at night when one is most receptive to surrealisms night time agenda which speaks to and from the subconscious illogic of dreams. Each storyline vanishes into another storyline until characters from separate storylines begin to appear together as the various storylines wind around each other like snakes round the limb of a tree--an oft repeated visual in the film. The opening sequence follows a soldier during the Napoleanic Wars as he takes refuge in a house where he finds the Saragossa Manuscript full of surreal drawings and stories. This book fascinates its reader so much the deafening sounds of the surrounding battle disappear as he begins to read...A Spanish Count with two escorts rides through deserted foothills towards a mysterious Inn. All around the Count are clues, pieces of stories that will later be told. He leaves his two escorts beside a gallows where two men hang dead and rides to the Inn. The Inn is built into the face of a cliff and within its recesses is a cave to rival Ali Babas. In the cave are two lovely Muslim sisters who seduce the Count and feed him wine from a skull...the textual games get more and more complicated. Each new character met tells his tale to the Count and though the Counts goal is to return home he is sidetracked time and again by ever more elaborate tales and locations. The characters met are all archetypal Spaniards and all fabulists. They are intoxicating characters all of them and intoxicating storytellers. It is an absolute pleasure to surrender to the heady spell of being told tale after tale by such characters. Its a world one never wants to leave--sophisticated and complex and mysterious, sometimes funny, sometimes haunting. If you already like Polish cinema you will recognize all of its stars from the 1960's here including Zbigniew Cybulski(Ashes and Diamonds)who plays the Count. And if you like surrealism and classic as well as modern literature you will thoroughly enjoy the way this story blends the classic and the ultra modern and the way it is illustrated like a book with the most amazing etchings and engravings.  A real book and art and film lovers masterpiece.",1043020800,52,2331,4.8275
1170776,5,8364361112,"This is a wonderful film. I had the chance to see it in obscure screenings and was blown away today when I discovered the DVD at our great neighborhood video store.
It's the story of a Spanish nobleman that has to get home fast. Against his better judgement he chooses the fastest route, crossing a mysterious land where strange things happen. Everything seems normal during the day, but at night the world is transformed and improbable characters materialize around him to entice him and tell him stories.
The defining characteristic of the film is the story within the story. Characters within a story rather quickly launch into yet another story until you realize you are many levels away from your starting point. A unique narrative experience. The movie manages to keep each single story interesting and leaves room for many surprises as stories interrelate in unexpected ways.
For the viewer there is a mounting conflict: wanting to get closure on previous stories while thoroughly enjoying the current one. Will the stories unravel back to the beginning? Either way this film does not disappoint.",1024790400,14,1103,5.032786885245901
1170777,3,8364361112,"The history of cinema is littered with the mangled remains of potentially great films shredded by censors or greedy distributors. Many of these films acquire legendary statuses the easier to sustain because of the impossibility of verification. The lucky few who have seen a film in its entirety become acolytes in an admiring cult, spreading a gospel of unrealized greatness. ""The Saragossa Manuscript"" is one such work. I remember first reading about it in the early 1970s, and I would occasionally see references to it as one of the great, unseen masterpieces of world cinema. Thanks to the interest of Jerry Garcia, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola, we now have a rare opportunity to subject one of these lost treasures to critical scrutiny.
It is certainly an unusual, at times striking work. A series of stories within stories, it is easy to see how ""Saragossa"" has acquired legendary status, since audiences tend to be too impressed with such baroque, Chinese box construction. It is also easy to see how the shortened versions released in the US and Great Britain would have been almost incomprehensible. It is worth remembering, however, that just because something has been butchered doesn't mean that it started out perfect. At the risk of heresy, I have to say that ""Saragossa"" is simply too long. A tinny literary conceit spun out to epic length and proportions, the film works from too minor an idea to justify its pretensions or reputation.
Isolated stretches of brilliance alternate with repetitive, dull sequences with little redeeming value beyond the complex structure. Visually, the film is remarkably bland, given its fantastic premises. The acting is uneven, ranging from refined, elegant theatrical gestures to broad slapstick. Even the structure, while imaginatively sustained, irritates after a while as it becomes clear that stories are deliberately being interrupted just to extend the conceit.
""The Sarragossa Manuscript"" is, in short, a well above average film with clever ideas, but insufficient cinematic skill to express them thoroughly. The butchers who mangled the film may have done it the greatest service imaginable. They helped to create a myth of lost greatness that is not borne out by the film itself.",1021593600,24,2245,5.204419889502763
1170778,5,8364361112,"Having read the book twice , I was quite prepared for the journey of Alphonse Van Warden in the high mountains of Spain and the many characters that he encounters, but don't let that stop you from joining him on his wild and often perplexing journey. The film is as truthful to the book as can be expected (but alot had to be trimmed to even make this 3 hour cut), and much of the horror, mystery, confusion, and romance is still present. Unfortunately my favorite stories of the wandering Jew are absent, but you still have the stories of Don Toledo, Busqueros, The hermit, Pasheko, and so many others brought to life before your eyes.
 The disc looks wonderful, video is in a stunning 2x1 black white anamorphic video taken from Wojciech Has' original and only complete print of the film. Some washing can be seen in the begining outdoor shots but this can also be from the original lighting. Burn marks are still evident for signifying the reel changes but this does not take away from the picture quality itself, little or no artifacting is present and some very minor and almost unnoticeable scratches in a few sequences. Overall a pretty darn good video presentation.
 Sound is a Dolby Digital mono track in Polish - voices (especially the Gypsy chief) are much more robust if the subwoofer is turned up. There is also an isolated soundtrack also in Dolby Digital mono which is a mixture of the actual score and the many sounds that Krysysztof Pendericki (he also did the scores for the Shining and The Exorcist)used for an otherworldly feel in the film. English removeable subtitles are also present.
Rounding off extra features are filmographies and an extremly brief (8 or so) still gallery.
Overall a great deal for the money, especially for a film which had a limited release here in the states in the mid 60's and then disappeared until the late 90's only for another limited release. Do yourself a favor and see this film - you've never seen anything like it before and probably never will again. Words can't bring you into the full depth of the plot and its many convolutions, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1017619200,26,2124,4.6462765957446805

1170785,5,8364361112,"Wojciech Has' The Saragossa Manuscript (1965) is a filmmakers' film. Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Luis Buuel, David Lynch, and my associate John Semper, Jr. are among its impassioned devotees.  Has' film is also a cult favorite, no doubt helped by Jerry Garcia's advocacy.  Superlative artistry and bold originality would be reason enough for its elevated aesthetic standing, but The Saragossa Manuscript also begs description.

The methodical, brooding, short-lived Zbigniew Cybulski (Ashes and Diamonds, 1958) heads a prodigious cast that remarkably fleshes out Count Jan Potocki's 19th century, picaresque, magical realist novel.  After the discovery of the titular manuscript, The Unknown Soldier is transported in time and space joining Alfonso van Worden's (Cybulski) on a phantasmagorical, anecdotal journey during the Napoleonic Wars.  Van Worden leads his uneasy party down a depraved path through the Spanish Mountains, temporarily settling at the infamous Sierra Morena.

Temptation comes in the form of incestuous, Wagnerian sisters who seduce the protagonist in the imaginative terrain.  Heresy is the sacrificial lamb, aflame in adroit eroticism. Van Worden's journey commands relentless attention as Has masterfully weaves a Byzantine labyrinth of multi-layered tales which range from the epic to the intimate, from Gothic surrealism to frivolous exoticism. These vignettes are simultaneously romantic, satirical, parlous, buoyantly humorous, macabre, exotic, grandiose, enigmatic, heinous and sprinkled with erotic spirituality. Yet, the flow of the film is remarkably contained by Has' surprisingly consistent, effervescent  handling of Potocki's dizzying narrative.

Inquisitors, spectral gallows, Tunisian princesses, and Nubian slaves are part of van Worden's trial as he finds himself, repeatedly, in the paradoxical Magic Flute-like roles of steadfast hero (Tamino) and wayward prodigal (Papageno), which results in a boundlessly expansive pilgrimage.  Clues to van Worden's riddle lie in recurring, treacherous symbols of hanging carcasses and discarded maps.  Much like Moses in Arnold Schoenberg's ""Moses und Aron"", van Worden is impotent in expression, requiring his potential, charismatic savior Aron in the form of a second protagonist: Velasquez (Gustaw Holoubek).  Velasquez's grasp of poetry and mathematics far surpasses that of van Worden, and his rescue of van Worden from the Grand Inquisitor is as much a symbol of sight and salvation from van Worden's blind impotency in all things physical, psychological and spiritual.

The texture of The Saragossa Manuscript often resembles a Max Ernst canvas.  The production design by Jerzy Skarzynski fleshes out van Worden's visionary desert-scape, which becomes increasingly alien in its milieu. Paradoxically, the main characters are impressively three dimensional, which is no easy feat in surrealism.

The Saragossa Manuscript integrates the eclectic tenets of Phenomenology, Imagism, Futurism, Surrealism, and Absurdism, to name but a few.  Rationalism is, to quote Heidegger, delightfully out the door, making for an incomparable, existential potpourri of idiosyncratic weirdness.

1170786,2,8364361112,"This is a totally silly Polish film from 1965, I only watched it because there are all these signs on the outside saying that it is the favourite film of Jerry Garcia, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppolla (interesting, right?), but the film itself is not quite what you'd want to commit three hours to. It is interesting to some extend, in that it shows an event, and then jumps back to the event that precedes that (through some storytelling or otherwise), and just meanders about through various sword fights and other hallucinogenic episodes (mostly involving a skull-shaped chalice). Delicous. The common image throughout is of the two criminals tortured and left to die, the two voluptuous sister, and woman's two breasts. Beautiful.",1314316800,,740,5.073770491803279

The story is set in Spain, but the characters are, naturally, Polish through and through.  How do I know?  Why from my vast experience with Polish characters through Polish movies, naturally.  OK, again all I know about the Polish is they have great films and a language I could never learn, but this is an unfolding story which is told in a giant book called the Saragossa Manuscript.  The beginning story segues into another story within the book, and then that story veers off into other stories as soon as a new narrator steps up to recount his adventures, and so forth.  In the end it all comes together, sort of, but along the way one will marvel at the colorful characters and the historical setting (which is not specified I think but you see a glimpse of the Inquisition in it).
