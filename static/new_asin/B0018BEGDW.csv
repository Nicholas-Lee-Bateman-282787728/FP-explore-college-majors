8269243,3,B0018BEGDW,"OK this had the possibility of being a really good movie, it was funny and moving in places and kept me interested for the most part BUT ... MY GOD who ever thought of casting that lead chubby hispanic guy, HE IS HORRIBLE at acting, he keeps looking up after every sentence like if he were in a stage play of Macbeth and overacting in every scene - ugh I could go on and on and on!

 I am so sad because had it not been for him in this role it would have been a really good movie and I would have recommended to friends but I'm sorry I just cant with this guy in it. He really is THAT bad! All the other cast members do a really good job and are (for the most part) BELIEVABLE except for the drag queen who does a very bad Joan Crawford Mommie Dearest impression for about 10 minutes . That being said she (or he) is not nearly as bad as that lead hispanic guy - sad that one person can bring down an entire film but its true. The casting director must have been high the day he decided to cast this lead chubby hispanic guy!

8269244,3,B0018BEGDW,"Probably, this low-budget movie presents a psycho-dramatic comedy of same gender attracted lads sorting out relations prior to attending private sex-party.

Many of issues embedded from a notion of urge, attraction and simple need for a financial gain.",1275868800,,252,5.631578947368421

8269246,3,B0018BEGDW,"In ""R U Invited? Five Guys And A Sex Party"" (2006), a group of 20-something gay friends receive an e-mail telling them about a sex party that night, with one condition: They must first ""apply"" to be invited, by e-mailing back a nude photo of themselves. As they gather at the house that hunky Ben shares with his Sugar Daddy, and snap digital photos of each other, we meet the group. Besides Ben, whose older, rich lover has no problem with him seeking sex on the side, there is a newlywed gay couple (Mondo and Jason) taking their first step toward an ""open"" relationship, the slutty Charlie (who happens to be Mondo's ex), and the chubby and somewhat naive Gordy. As they wait together for return e-mail with invites to the party, they talk about dating, past relationships, monogamy, the difference between sex and love, and what each is looking for in a relationship. Jason is especially nervous about the party, and his fears are magnified by Charlie's obvious flirting with Mondo before the party. Gordy discusses with Ben his dysfunctional on again/off again
relationship with a guy who is obviously using him, and a revelation by Ben results in Gordy taking potshots at Ben's relationship.

This low-budget comedy, shot directly on video, features mostly actors without any screen credits, and there is a not insignificant amount of overacting on display at times. In general, however, the writer/director/music composer/film editor does a commendable job with what he has, and there aren't any noticeable production glitches to name. While the concept is original, the script is simplistic and predictable, and occasionally veers into eye-rolling trite dialogue. Still, it talks about things that young gay people don't really talk about as much as they should, and it says it in an entertaining fashion. Not rated, but would be a hard ""R"" for some nudity and sexual situations. DVD has outtakes, trailer and chapter stops. I give it three stars out of five.",1217462400,3,1967,4.960606060606061
