8306258,3,B001GNG2Y8,"Four more episodes from DECOY, the groundbreaking police drama from 1958, starring Beverly Garland.  In a time when the most an actress ever played on TV was a housewife or secretary, Garland created history as the first ever female policewoman on a regular series.  As rookie cop Casey Jones, Garland was by turns vigilant, sympathetic and incredibly vulnerable, shading the role of Casey with the very real issues involved in being a female in a male-dominated work environment.  The DECOY series was created as a ""tribute"" to female law enforcers, and I'm sure, inspired countless female viewers to consider applying for the force.

Picture and sound issues aside, the four episodes contained in this, Alpha's third volume from the series, are some of it's all-time best; with an early appearance from Suzanne Pleshette in one of the episodes sure to delight her legion of fans.

Episodes:

""Night of Fire"" - Casey must go undercover as a secretary in an effort to find the arsonist who started a $100,000 warehouse fire.

""Cry Revenge"" - A dysfunctional family's personal problems hinder Casey's ability to protect them from a gang of vicious hoodlums.

""The Sound of Tears"" - Casey tries to unravel a bizarre Central Park murder involving the son of a wealthy socialite.  Suzanne Pleshette, in one of her first TV roles, is the young woman suspected of killing him.

""Night Light"" - Casey learns that not even the rich and famous are immune to crime when she's assigned to investigate the theft of an expensive necklace. Martin Balsam guest stars.",1290556800,5,1552,4.957528957528957
