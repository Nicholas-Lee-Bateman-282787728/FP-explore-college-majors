Just email me, and we can talk.",1349222400,,122,3.6923076923076925

7838785,5,6303112234,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was a Kid.  I bought it several years back and still watch it today.  I wish it would come out on DVD so that I can watch even more. (vhs degrades over time) I still quote this movie when ever I get a chance.  I wish more people knew this movie so the quotes would make more sence to them.  A must see and you will be hooked, promise!",1151107200,,377,3.7341772151898733
7838786,4,6303112234,"This is a funny animated special about a rock group, not the Johnny Hart caveman comic strip B.C.  If you were lokking for that, try B.C. First Thanksgiving, or B.C. Christmas Special.
This one may not be suitable for small kids, parents will have to decide.",1134086400,,258,4.608695652173913
7838787,5,6303112234,I watched this the first time way back when and still think it is one of the best animated adult films.  Fun view of man - and its kind - with good music to boot.  Everyone should see it at least once.,1133568000,,201,3.761904761904762
7838788,5,6303112234,I watched this movie for the first time just after it came out in about 1985.  I stopped counting how many times I've watched it since then with my brothers and friends and anyone else I could get to sit through it!!  It is unbelievably funny and crude and has incredible music in it (great rock bands from the eighties).  A must see for an alternate view on how the world began.  I can still quote most of it!! (Much to my husband's chagrin!!!),1017100800,,445,4.261904761904762
7838789,5,6303112234,"If you are into ""alternative"" this is for you... it spans all groups.  I first saw it in my college ""beer-swilling-skiing-scum-dog-days"" and now in my ""own-a-home-ready-to-start-a-family-responsible-mentality"" I still think it's great!  [Of course, I also liked, ""Shallow Grave"", ""Curdled"", ""Stark"", and ""Amazon Women On The Moon""... so, as they say, 'consider the source']!
Cheers!",1005177600,2,382,6.055555555555555
7838790,5,6303112234,"This is the all time greatest cartoon comedy.  It is the story of the birth of mankind in a comical sort of way...  If you have the chance to rent or buy this movie you would kick yourself for not...  Also, the soundtrack is great for us that enjoy hard rock.  Although the date says 1994 I beleive the movie is from the early 80's..  But who cares it's great for anytime.",1000080000,3,372,4.111111111111111
7838791,5,6303112234,"This movie was hilarious. I have searched all over and I have finally found it. I laughed, I cried...it was an experience I will never forget! An emotional rollercoaster to say the least. 2 high fives on this animated adventure of the millenium. It's a must see for any adult cartoon fan. I rate it higher than Heavy metal for content & humor. The music isn't bad either. Not for the kiddos though. You don't want them to see you wet yer pants, from laughing when Stewie is dragged by his umbellical cord, anyway!",998265600,5,513,4.468085106382978
