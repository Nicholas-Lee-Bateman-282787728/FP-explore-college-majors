6119268,3,B00GV8AZYG,"I actually have a question. Is this a DVD of the series that ran on Cartoon Network from August 24, 2013-Dec. 6, 2014, or is it totally new material? Because I want the former and am rather teed off by the flimsy description provided by the seller and stupid reviews that don't tell people anything about what they are buying. I don't care that it's LEGO, I don't care that you don't like it because you're not a kid, and I don't care what your kid did with it. I enjoy anime, and this fit the bill for the time it took. Since the Tenkai Knights DVDs are all out of region for the USA, I am looking for a USA version of the show.",1472256000,,629,4.04

8627798,2,B00GV8AZYG,"From wiki: ""the first DVD release combined the first several episodes and cut them together into a movie"".  Do not watch this with any expectation of a non-cliffhanger.  If you don't mind that (and the fact it does run like multiple anime episodes condensed into movie form), then this is more like 3.5-4 stars.  It's a bit cheesy but the humor makes up for it.",1521331200,,361,4.523076923076923
8627799,5,B00GV8AZYG,"Pretty good movie, it is definitely a kids show but the dialogue is witty enough that adults won't be face palming constantly. I wish they would dub the series too.",1509753600,,164,4.5
8627800,2,B00GV8AZYG,"Okay, this is interesting. This is like the first original Saturday Morning anime that was released on Blu-Ray without the whole series getting released already. This is basically the first four episodes cut together into a 73-minute movie. Spin Master should know that anime fans like me want this kind of stuff un-edited, as actual episodes. Besides, just releasing this on home video is laziness at its worst. I would really like the whole series to be released in, like, a 6-disc Blu-Ray set, or an 8-disc DVD set, and on digital outlets. I have yet to check if any and all Phase 4 releases are also released on digital outlets ""by themselves"", but I don't count on that. And I don't think I'll be buying this Blu-Ray, because of the outrageous pricing compared to the DVD. That's just to far for a 73-minute movie. In other words, if you're interested, just get the DVD, otherwise, if you want the Blu-Ray, boycott this release until the price drops to like under $10.

EDIT: Either that or just wait until someone like Shout! Factory, Cinedigm, or any anime licensing company grabs a hold of the series itself.",1505433600,2,1116,4.6938775510204085
