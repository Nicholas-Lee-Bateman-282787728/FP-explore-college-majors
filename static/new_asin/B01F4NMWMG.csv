7743313,5,B01F4NMWMG,"I enjoyed this excellent cowboy series on television from 1958 to 1963.  Because it is the best, I wish that they have cleaned it more completely from little white and black ""dust.""  From time to time there were some frames that had long white lines. But buying it is still worth the money!",1480032000,,290,4.452830188679245
7743314,1,B01F4NMWMG,Bought a set and returned it because disc 1 & 2 were scratched. Recieved a new set and discs  1 & 2 were also scratched. I'm pretty sure this will keep happening because the playing surface of disc 1 & 2 actually touch the case itself. Disc three is slightly elevated and does not touch the case. I'm going to contact Levy-Gardner the company that released the Rifleman and let them know that they need to start using different cases. The show itself is great. My review is based solely on the crappy cases.,1479427200,3,507,4.3936170212765955
7743315,5,B01F4NMWMG,The Rifleman is my all time favorite western TV series. Season 3 Vol. 2 should be of special interest to those of you fans who bought The Rifleman box sets that were produced by MPI years ago since not all of the episodes were included in those sets. Season 3 Vol. 2 includes some of those missing episodes. I also look forward to Season 4 and 5 as they become available since those will contain the rest of the missing episodes.,1477699200,2,429,4.308641975308642

7743317,1,B01F4NMWMG,"excellent show, but poorly transferred. video quality is fair to good, and i keep getting scratched disks that won't play. they have a disclaimer that says they use top of the line video equipment and that if you have problems playing your discs you may need to upgrade your dvd player software! i never had these problems with all the Bonanza and Gunsmoke dvds i bought!",1487203200,,371,4.636363636363637
7743318,5,B01F4NMWMG,An oldie but goodie TV western show!  A real family-oriented show--teaches young and old alike values to live by.  Excellent acting!!!,1487030400,,134,5.333333333333333

7743321,5,B01F4NMWMG,"What can you say... They don not make Television series the way they used to. The Rifleman is a series that in every episode gives you such wonderful examples of how to bring up your children & be more of what the Lord would like us to be. I know in this totally, selfish & ""selfie-Gimme"" world people want to sickly see the BAD GUY WIN!! What a bunch of people who do not know what it is like to be punished or spanked for their crimes to us, society & to themselves. They have no proper parental guidance today. All these kids see is killing & more killing & death in these shows today. AND THEY ALL COMPLAINED THAT THE 3 STOOGES WAS TOO VIOLENT!! What a sad betrayal for all of us.
  The examples from this show are old fashioned, proper balance of leading a GOOD, Godly life. This may offend these young children of today who know nothing of ""suffering at the hands of the BAD GUY', & who care nothing nor have any EMPATHY for anyone else but themselves. This TV series is from the Good Old days, when people had EMPATHY & consideration for the next person & wanted to BUILD instead of TEARING DOWN!! My FAMILY & I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ENTIRE TELEVISION SERIES. If you are like us, the silent majority, it will be a wonderful breath of fresh air to sit down & watch a very, very satisfying show!",1483920000,2,1300,4.2591093117408905
