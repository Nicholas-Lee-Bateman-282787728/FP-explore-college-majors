8691309,1,B00QHDW86S,"I do not believe this fabulous early JT BBC concert has ever been officially released. It seems there is more than one version circulating. I assume they have all  been captured from TV Broadcasts. I know of 3 DVD-R versions (quality) of this concert.  One version shows Trio in the right bottom corner of the video. A second version shows BBC in the upper left corner of the video. The BBC version is far superior quality video. There is also a Trio version that is pretty good. Although the graphics on this DVD get an A+, the video content is the sub-par Trio version. If you prefer a higher quality video, rather than high just quality graphics, try to find the BBC version. The Graphics are done very well though, and appear to be an original release.",1425859200,,756,4.510948905109489
