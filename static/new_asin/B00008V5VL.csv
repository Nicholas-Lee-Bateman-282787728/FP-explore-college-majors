7987030,5,B00008V5VL,"This is a wonderful way to deal with a child's desire to be ""like everyone else"".  It takes the characters through the absurdity of trying to keep up with changing fashion.  Extremely well done and very entertaining.",1234569600,,216,4.8108108108108105
7987031,5,B00008V5VL,"This movie is such a blessing! Continuing in the same vein of the Wemmick stories, this movie addresses the issue of self-esteem and the desire to fit into the crowd. Green-painted noses are the newest trend to hit Wemmicksville, and as always, our beloved Punchinello is tempted by the fast talking, worldy views of Willie Withit, as well as his fellow Wemmicks.

There are so many wonderful themes in this story, including the redemptive power of God's love for His creation, illustrated when Eli (the character who symbolizes God), easily and lovingly forgives Punchinello, even after Punch has had his nose painted an array of colors!

I highly recommend this movie, as well as any of the other Wemmick movies.",1130889600,3,714,4.941666666666666
7987032,5,B00008V5VL,My kids who are 2 1/2 and 4 loved this movie and couldn't get enough of it.  I think the animation was wonderful and the storyline is awesome some people might not get that it's a representaion of God and us.  I can't say enough great things about Max Lucado.  He is doing great things for kids and adults!!,1107216000,5,307,4.169491525423729
