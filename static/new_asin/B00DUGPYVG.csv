8597908,5,B00DUGPYVG,"An engaging and absorbing historic recreation of the Bourbon dynasty and the three kings who defined Versailles from the mid 17th century to the late 18th century. The series begins with the reign of Louis XIV who creates, an opulent castle and dazzles his court and subjects. He is ultimately a hard act for his successors to follow. Louis XV, the child king, is presented with the daunting task of taking the reign from a charismatic and popular ruler who will forever be known as and regarded as 'The Sun King'. The lack or real guidance, personal circumstances and misfortune this extravagant, and at times debauched king, struggles to be taken seriously by both his court and family. Despite his questionable relationships with a string of courtesans, he reigns at a time in history when the public are becoming restless with the absolute rule of an autocrat. He leaves a debt ridden palace and estate to his successor Louis XVI whose rule is almost doomed to failure from the time he becomes king. Without the appropriate guidance to adapt to the times and the stirrings of revolution in his own country, England and Colonial America, this king is dogged by a court who refuses to give way to personal privileges. As the third estate demand that all subject, including the church and the privileged classes, pay tax Louis XVI is torn between following the plans of his financial advisors and the aggressive response from his court. Despite his best intentions to spare the palace and country from debt he caves into the demands of his court, which ultimately sign his death warrant. The dramatic execution of Louis XVI and his Queen was and still is the emblem of the French Revolution. This vivid account of these three kings and their place in the French Revolution is far more engaging than the many dusty tomes found in university libraries.",1500768000,3,1851,4.823899371069182
