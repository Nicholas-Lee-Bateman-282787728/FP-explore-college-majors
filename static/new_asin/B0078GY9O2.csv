8512313,1,B0078GY9O2,"What an absolute mess, turns out that you need to red the manga/novel/whatever its based on to understand what the hell is going on. I really hate that kind of crap. A movie/anime/whatever should stand on its own strengths. I'm cool with supplementary stuff, side stories, and all that jazz, but if I have to read the orignal novel to have any sort of inkling of the plot or characterization or to even derive any sort of basic enjoyment out of an anime, that anime has failed utterly. Umineko may be based on some visual novel, but I was still able to follow it's ridiculous dream logic and enjoy it. Baccano and Haruhi are based on light novels, and both excise details, but they rank as my favorite anime series from this decade because they're able to take the concepts from the novels and build and improve upon them. If it turns out that familiarity with the original stories is necessary to enjoy Kyoukai, it's crap. Spend your money on something else.",1368662400,3,959,4.5813953488372094
8512314,3,B0078GY9O2,"I'll include ""movie 8"" in this review because ""movie 8"" is essentially an extra for fanboys that really want to find out what the writers decided was ""behind"" Shiki's personality disorder. (Mild Spoilers ahead!)

I should also say  up front that I can only base my review on what I got in the Malaysian version as advertised here.

There are seven ""movies"" but in fact most are of around 45 minutes duration, designed for hour-long TV episodes perhaps. They deal with the involvement of a senior student, Kokutou (also spelled Kokoto) with Shiki Ryougi (Ryogi) and the involvement of both of them in an ongoing struggle against supernatural forces after they leave school. This is all roughly in the Horror genre. The short version is, they become employees(?) of a supernatural detective agency (possibly with official backing) under the tutelage of Touko, also known as Toko, a talented magus and chain-smoking badass red-head. While employed on the business of finding out why ghostly stuff happens, Shiki gets to exercise her supernatural ability to kill anything, including spirits, and Kokutou gets to tolerate her in a gentle and humane way. There are distractions, such as his kid sister who (in the manner of anime) has an incestuous lust for him. (Nothing happens - it's not Hentai!) Strange enemy magi crop up, who are quite possibly to blame for Everything. But maybe not.

The artwork is stunningly good and the main characters are among the deepest, or perhaps most obscure of purpose, I have ever seen depicted. The music is excellent - no inappropriate J-Pop songs or jarring metal riffs here. Oh, and there are a couple of funny claymation silent clips tucked in between Movies. Unfortunately the subtitling is uneven. Movies one and seven are appallingly bad - pretty much at the level of typing the script into Google Translate and seeing what you get. This is the worse because Movie seven is probably the decisive one.

Movie 1: As in several other anime series a story has been taken out from near the end of the whole arc, and used as the introductory work. I believe you can probably skip watching this. Its plot, though riveting and disturbing, does not connect well to the main story. In fact in some regards it will give a false impression of what the series is ""all about.""

Movies 2 - 6: These are excellent, including the subtitles. Most, though not all, are 43-49 minutes; Movie 5 (IIRC) is 2 hours. A coherent story-line is built up, although the timeline skips back and forth between the mid and late 90s. They are compelling and bloody, but not particularly creepy.

Movie 7+8: I wish this was up to the quality of the previous five. But it is not. Movie 7 is very long (2.5 hours?) but far from concluding the series satisfactorily, leaves many issues unanswered while introducing several new issues. Movie 8, far from resolving these new issues, is a half-hour navel-gaze into where Ryougi's state of mind(s) came from, and resolves nothing, since it really doesn't matter where her state of mind came from. (Think: Major Motoko and the 'Laughing Man', discussing things in the Library, then think of watching that for 30 minutes.) So it is really an ""extra"" and while beautiful, should not be packaged as a separate article. The background art on this is a tour-de-force.

Overall: steer clear of this, and look for one with English-language voice actors. But highly recommended for the art, sound, and general storyline.",1344902400,,3458,4.859083191850594
8512315,1,B0078GY9O2,"All 8 movies in one set? Too good to be true right? And it is I'm afraid. This amazing collection isn't even worthy of being called sub-par. The case and disc art is very professional and nice-looking, but that's where the positives end. Although, like many other animes from Malaysia, this collection bares the ""legal"" holographic mark of their government, it is sadly a poor pirate copy. Very poorly translated English subtitles (can't understand what is going on at all) and sooooo many pixels it hurt my eyes. Seven movies on 2 discs?? Yeah, it just doesn't happen. Sorry to bring the bad news guys, but I didn't want anyone else to lose their money!",1336521600,31,654,4.695652173913044
