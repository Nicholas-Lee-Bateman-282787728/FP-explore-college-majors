6124333,5,B00GZ0MKZC,Great video for young toddlers and slightly older kids learning letter sounds.,1412985600,,78,5.583333333333333
6124334,5,B00GZ0MKZC,One of the best sesame DVDs ever!! All my kids enjoy it from 2 yrs up to 12yrs old. I bought another copy *just in case.*,1412294400,,121,3.6923076923076925
6124335,5,B00GZ0MKZC,Bought for my great grandson as he loves to listen to Elmo.,1405641600,,59,4.0
6124336,5,B00GZ0MKZC,"We have a few Sesame Street videos and all ready my son has put this into his rotation of favorites! It has both cartoons, short skits, and many musical numbers both newer and old. The DVD takes you letter by letter through it with songs pertaining to each letter. After every few letters they sing an alphabet song and/or show a skit. My son is twenty months old and this movie kept him quite engaged sitting, dancing, and singing.
Unlike other Sesame videos we own, this one is long so we have had to watch it in segments but it's all equally engaging. Some videos in it include a Glee-like skit, I'm the Letter T, 'U' really got a hold on me, and of course 'C' is for Cookie.
I have only a couple negative comments which are not deal breakers to say the least....  Some of the older videos are off in sound, like in the Q song there is a big difference in quality. My second downer is that the 'Rebel L' was not part of the L section of this video, kind of a bummer.
Overall a Very enjoyable and parent tolerable video to add to the collection.",1404950400,5,1047,4.208955223880597

6124355,4,B00GZ0MKZC,"This DVD is a great help in teaching my 3 year old his ABC's.  The singing also helps with our son's rhythm and speech.  Great dvd!  Learning is muscle memory, so repetitive action is the key.",1445212800,2,192,4.277777777777778
6124356,2,B00GZ0MKZC,This video is a collection of songs on more poplar videos. It was very repetitive since we already have the others .,1443312000,,116,4.318181818181818

6124366,5,B00GZ0MKZC,If ypu want your child to learn their alphabets in a fun way. Thus is the cd to get. My son watches it at least once a day and he is already learning his alphabets at 17months. He even knows how to hum the alphabet song. I am so glad i got this cd. Even my 5yr old niece enjoys watching it,1426204800,2,289,3.6774193548387095
6124367,5,B00GZ0MKZC,"the ""S"" is really sleezy, it looks like it's doing a drug deal - and the ""U"" is beyond creepy. But, I have to give this ""5 Stars"" because my son's been obsessed with it from the time he was about 18 months until now. He watches it multiple times per day, and I think it's helpful for him in learning his letters. I wish they'd recut the ""S"" and the ""U"" but otherwise, it's pretty awesome. I am thankful for this compilation and want others to find it too!",1426032000,,455,4.066666666666666
