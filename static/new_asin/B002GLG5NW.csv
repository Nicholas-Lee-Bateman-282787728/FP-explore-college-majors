3924851,2,B002GLG5NW,"I think its time Degrassi next gen start thinking about calling it quits.
Don't get me wrong I love the series; i have been a fan since the beginning. It just seems to me that they are running out of fresh ideas...

This time around there are a lot of new faces, which means a lot of the old ones are no where to be found. There is the same old drama as past seasons; unrequited love, strict and controlling parental figures and of course the quintessential NERDS! But what is new and exciting about this series??? From what i could see it was nothing special.

If you're a fan of the series like i am then you will probably over look the fact that the series is beginning to go down hill and you will fork out the cash to buy this DVD. In all honesty i will probably continue to buy the series until they do finally pull the plug not because of the amazing story lines but because i want the complete series. Even though it's not the Degrassi I have come to know and love I will stand by it till the end.",1274400000,5,1005,4.096446700507614
3924852,4,B002GLG5NW,"The Season:
This season on Degrassi it's out with the old and in with the new. As this season introduces many new characters and drops many of The Next Generation Originals besides a select few (Emma, Manny, Liberty and Spinner). I feel that was one of the problems with this season, I felt there wasn't enough closure with the originals who were dropped, although some of them do appear in the ""Degrassi Goes Hollywood Movie"", but I'll get to that later. As I mentioned earlier Season 8 introduces many new characters this season and brings back the Lakehurst kids (Holly J, Anya, Jane, Sav, Johnny and Bruce) who were all introduced in Season 7 (besides Johnny, who was introduced in Season 6). I feel that is another problem with this season, WAY to many characters! Some of whom hardly get any character development at all (Leia, Blue, Bruce). Many of the plots this season were a real bore, and a lot of it was relationship drama. I did like a handful of episodes this season though (Didn't We Almost Have It All, Bad Medicine, Jane Says (A-Plot Only), Heart Of Glass, Danger Zone). But in my opinion this season was kind of like somebody threw up, as in I thought it was a mess. From randomly introducing plots in an episode then randomly dropping them, and how everything was wrapped up within an episode, and way to many new characters while they also try to pay attention to old ones. Overall I give Season 8: *** Stars or a C. Now lets move onto the DVD.

The DVD:
Now while I overall didn't like this season of Degrassi, I thought the DVD was great! Echo Bridge Entertainment is really good with putting good extras on their Degrassi DVD's. A lot of the Funamation releases had very boring extras like the Degrassi Flipbook and Trailers for anime shows and old episodes of Degrassi. But on the Echo Bridge releases they put the online mini's, on the set material, and deleted scenes from the season and the movie. Much more well balanced for an extra features disc, in my opinion anyway. The Season 8 DVD set also comes with the 4-part finale turned movie ""Degrassi Goes Hollywood"", in widescreen. All of the episodes, features and the movie seem to be in good quality when I watch them on my TV, better quality then the Season 7 DVD which seemed very grainy in quality when watching it. So overall I would give the DVD: ***** or an A. Now here's my mini review of the ""Degrassi Goes Hollywood Movie"".

Paradise City: Degrassi Goes Hollywood Movie:
""Paradise City"" or ""Degrassi Goes Hollywood"" is the 4-part Season 8 finale turned into a 90 minute feature-length film. This is the first ever Degrassi: The Next Generation Movie and it's not that bad. The film brings back some characters who were absent for all of Season 8 (Paige, Marco, Ellie and Craig). One of the things I kept wondering throughout the movie is how Paige ended up in Hollywood working for the Heidi Montag parody, Hailey Montel. It just seemed so random, as the last time we saw Paige she was working for Andrea and was dating Griffin. Also she had an HIV plot that was never wrapped up (Season 7). I just don't like how it showed her in Hollywood with no explanation whatsoever. Paige's part of the plot also felt very rushed to me, and it seemed like she regressed to her Season 1-self. And it sucks because Paige is my favorite character and to see her regressed within 90 minutes was lame. Manny's part of the plot also seemed rushed and she was also randomly dating her drama professer, that was completely out of nowhere. The greatest part of the movie is surprisingly Ellie's part. I was very surprised when I enjoyed Ellie's plot the most, I thought her plot was going to be so boring. But it was actually good as they brought back a very old plot from Season 3 with her dad returning from the war with PTSD. Very good to see Ellie be pretty much all wrapped up. But as for the overall movie it was just okay. I give Paradise City: Degrassi Goes Hollywood: **** Stars or a B.

Okay man that was a long review, thanks to anyone who read all of it and remember ""You can make it through!"" Haha.",1259107200,14,4081,4.489905787348587
3924853,5,B002GLG5NW,I've always been a very large fan of Degrassi: The Next Generation and of course order each season as it comes out and this box set is by far one of the best I've come across in quite a while.  It had a great variety of extra features as apposed to the sparse here and there extra's that the DVD's usually do.,1254614400,,309,3.9838709677419355
3924854,5,B002GLG5NW,"It wasn't Degrassi's best season yet, but it wasn't its worst cause there are a few episodes that really teaches you something plus you get to see the Ally vs. Holly J episode,which is my favorite. Best thing about ECHO BRIDGE HOME ENTERTAINMENT is that they're releasing DEGRASSI in a faster pace than FUNIMATION. Though, what happened to the halloween episode where JANE is possessed by RICK? But this dvd set has DEGRASSI GOES HOLLYWOOD & what better than that!!! Hopefully if DEGRASSI keeps releasing seasons on tv, will hope for this lost episode to make it on the next dvd set release.",1252886400,4,591,4.747572815533981

3924864,5,B002GLG5NW,I used to watch this show all the time when I was younger and when I saw that it was on sale on here I had to purchase it!

3924866,4,B002GLG5NW,In pretty sure this is the last season with the old actors. This is the last season I will be buying because they've went down hill. Stories are great and if you loved degrassi you won't wanna stop yet. All the good old actors are still involved its them going to college this season. The new actors do okay I liked Johnny and Allie the best of the newer characters. The newer seasons are become like a bad soap opera,1374451200,,417,4.225

3924870,5,B002GLG5NW,Been watching Degrassi since I was 14 and it is a soap for teens.  Deals with real teen issues in the way a teen would handle them.  Whether they be right or wrong.  No subject is left untouched.  Its great for kids 13 and up in my opinion.,1299456000,,240,3.9375
3924871,4,B002GLG5NW,I like the degrassi series but I wished they showed more african love black boy loves black girl. not only one couple for example three couples. the three couples should have dark skin then I would be more pleased. the blacks on the show always are fair skinned. I would like to see the blacks more darker than fair.,1294790400,,316,4.372881355932203

3924874,5,B002GLG5NW,"This season of Degrassi was pretty good and all the drama was intense too, They added new characters mostly for a new generation for this season, My favorite part of this season was Degrassi Goes Hollywood, That was a great season finally for the show and the best part was they brought back Paige, Ellie, Marco, and Craig to the show, but they were just in the season final which was weird but it was pretty good, This season features 18 episodes and also the 4 part movie Degrassi goes Hollywood, basically the show has 22 episodes for this season, I know one thing if you thought that the previous 7 season's were good you haven't seen nothing yet for this season, Plus Emma, Manny, and Liberty go to Smithdale and go to college and it was great seeing all of them be their instead of being at Degrassi, Anyway this season was really good and I'm looking forward to the rest of the future season's to this show.",1274572800,2,914,4.414201183431953
