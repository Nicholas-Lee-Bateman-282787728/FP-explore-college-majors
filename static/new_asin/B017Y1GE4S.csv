7537601,5,B017Y1GE4S,"In spite of seeming bad blood between the English and Irish this series sets a tempo of what is possible if we can "" just learn to get along ! ""  Highly recommended !",1262649600,,166,3.8823529411764706
7537602,2,B017Y1GE4S,"I was looking forward to seeing these shows again but was a little more than somewhat disappointed because it was advertised as CC (Closed Captioned) and is not, at least my copy. You guessed it I am deaf so the captioning is very important to me. I have seen the shows in the first run on PBS so I know story line. It was CC on KCET. I wish I could return it but I opened it up so Amazon most likely would not let me return it.
My copy is not pristine, visually. It looks like a copy of a copy.
So you are forewarned.",1251590400,8,518,3.8962264150943398
7537603,3,B017Y1GE4S,"If you enjoy the common British stereotype of the Irish as devious, drunken, superstitious, thieving liars, then this is the show for you.  The hero of the story is a minor British official, a man thoroughly decent and likable, though a bit bumbling at times.  In episode after episode, we see him tricked and humiliated by the Irish people he tries to serve.  If that sounds appealing, well, join in the fun and buy this series.  I found it minimally amusing and continuously irritating.  (The Irish scenery, on the other hand, is gorgeous, and the actors are competent.)  The Irish people should rise up and complain.  But perhaps they're all too drunk and nasty.",1248825600,7,665,4.780701754385965

7537605,5,B017Y1GE4S,We watched this series many years ago and it was enjoyable to see them again. Especially the behind the scenes information from the actors and director.  We missed the great commentary from Alistair Cook introducing each episode.  M. Hanner,1234396800,,240,5.128205128205129
7537606,5,B017Y1GE4S,"I saw this series some years back on PBS ""Masterpiece Theatre"".  It is completely and utterly delightful.  The English, Irish, Scots (so many of the people of the British Aisles - Welsh, too, I am sure) have such a wonderful gift of turning a quaint and colorful phrase.  There is a scene somewhere in the series along a country roadside where a lower-class Irish bloke is attempting to be familiar in a loud and somewhat grating manner with a high-class Irish lady riding in her carriage.  The lady responds to the low-class fellow in an inimitable manner that only a Brit could do.  She said something to the effect that ""Just because you and I are both Irish doesn't mean we're old friends"".  I Loved it.

And so will you.",1216166400,3,725,4.530769230769231
7537607,5,B017Y1GE4S,"One day in a moment of idle curiosity we wondered if The Irish R.M. was available on DVD.  We had enjoyed it throughly when it was on PBS ""back in the day"" and thought it would be nice to be able to watch it again.  We found that we had forgotten how many expressions the local Irish had used on the Major that are as funny today as when originally viewed.

7537615,5,B017Y1GE4S,I am enjoying this series again after seeing it many years ago on PBS.  The characters are delightful and it is such fun to see first how the R.M. adjusts to life in Ireland and then  becomes immersed in the culture and people of Ireland.  He gets involved with schemes  with some of the local people that are not illegal but more like pranks that need explaining to people who don't have much sense of humor.,1507248000,5,409,4.342105263157895

7537653,5,B017Y1GE4S,"An all time favorite, it is great to have the complete collection of The Irish RM.  We've had to make do through the years with scattered episodes recorded on various VCR tapes.  To watch the complete collection, episodes in proper order AND all there, is so satisfying.  Following the very English retired Major Yeates (Peter Bowles) as he  stoically takes on his new position of Resident Magistrate is also highly entertaining.  This takes place in a West Ireland county in the days before Irish independence and the Major doesn't really understand the people or the place in which he is supposed to make judicial decisions.  He is surrounded by eccentric wonderful citizens who can be touchingly helpful and just as easily can display an oppositional defiance to any rulings or requests.

7537658,5,B017Y1GE4S,"The Irish R.M: The Complete Collection. (1984-5-6). Re-release of a classic British period comedy television serial that was made in the mid-1980s, premiered in the United States on PBS Masterpiece Theatre in 1984. Classically English, slow-burning comic actor Peter Bowles (RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY, TO THE MANOR BORN), fully inhabits the title character, retired Army Major Sinclair Yeates.  In this light-hearted historical drama, he becomes an Irish resident magistrate in turn-of-the-20th-century pre-Independence rural West Ireland. As based on turn-of-the-century stories by Somerville and Ross, Major Sinclair Yeates finds himself living in a ramshackle country house surrounded by the communitys eccentric inhabitants, where he struggles to apply judicial logic in a land where the inevitable never happens, but the improbable frequently does. The episodes, which were shot entirely on location in County Kildare, affectionately capture life in the rural backcountry of Ireland at the time, as they capture the beauty of the lush Irish countryside. This complete series also stars David Kelly, (WAKING NED DEVINE); Beryl Reid (TINKER, TAILOR SOLDIER SPY); Bryan Murray, (PERFECT SCOUNDRELS); Niall Toibin, (BALLYKISSANGEL); Sarah Badel, (MRS. DALLOWAY); Anna Manahan, (ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN); Jonathan Ryan, (THE TUDORS) and Fintan McKeown, (GAME OF THRONES).  The episodes are:

Series 1
1. Great Uncle McCarthy. At an 1897 regimental ball, Yeates reveals he  plans to resign his commission in order to become an Irish resident magistrate, becomes engaged to Philippa.
2. Trinket's Colt. Eccentric Mrs. Knox, grandmother of horse-loving, mischief-making Flurry,Yeates landlord, wrongly believes that Yeates stole her prize mare's colt.
3. A Misdeal. Yeates and his now-wife Philippa visit a horse fair in search of a suitable mount for a forthcoming hunt.
4. The Boat's Share. Yeates and his cousin Basil fear that their careers are ruined when they are caught in a police raid.
5. Occasional Licences. A local publican neatly evades Yeates' objections to beer sales at the annual St Peter and St Paul's Day Games; chaos results.
6. O Love! O Fire! An exhausting night of dancing, dousing a fire, ends with a carefully planned surprise by Sally, daughter of Lady Knox, and Flurry Knox (weve been told as a result of country living many people around there are surnamed Knox).

Series 2
1. A Horse! A Horse! Flurry returns from  Parisian honeymoon with his new bride Sally, does his utmost to sell his horse.
2. The Dispensary Doctor. Flurry installs his candidate for local dispensary doctor, who promptly gets involved with a young woman and her mother. The annual race competition is more chaotic than usual.
3. Holy Island. In an episode that owes a lot to TIGHT LITTLE ISLAND, a ship filled with rum is shipwrecked on the beaches near Skebawn; the town appreciates it.
4. Oweneen the Sprat.  Felonious drunken  confusion at Christmas.
5. A Royal Command.  An Indian maharajah visits Skebawn: he and his three sons make up a talented polo team. They receive, accept  a ""friendly"" challenge from Flurry.  The usual confusion ensues.
6. The Aussolas Martin Cat. Flurry and Sally are living in Mrs. Knoxs castle at Aussolas; the older woman, perhaps unaware they are living there, puts it up for rent.

Series 3
1. The Muse in Skebawn. Simon Smiley introduces moving pictures to the town.  He is followed by theatrical, then dance impresarios beating paths to Yeates door.
2. Major Apollo Riggs. Babs' cousin Andrew turns Yeates' house inside out with structural attempts to improve the chimneys, open a sealed, long-closed mysterious well, install bathrooms.
3. The Friend of Her Youth. Everyone, including Maria, Yeates dog, which attacks the visitor, dislikes Babs' supercilious friend, Julian.
4. In the Curranhilty Country. Yeates' experience with a new motor car, his on a weeks approval, and a day of hunting do not go according to plan.
5. Lisheen Race. A stern official from Dublin Castle observes Yeates' conduct of his court; thinks him too lenient. The Ladies Race at Lisheen finds competition between Sally and Flurry.
6. The Devil You Know. The offer of an old friend's of Yeates, a high official at Dublin Castle, of a resident magistrate position in Meath County, considered a more civilized location, tempts Yeates.

The box set, which I received as a review copy, consists of six discs holding all three seasons eighteen episodes.  It is approximately 16 hours long, plus a 26-minute bonus making-of featurette. And, thank goodness, subtitles, for those not familiar with rural Irish patois. Mind you, due to the age of this vintage series, there are occasional flaws in audio and video that were beyond the abilities of the producers to correct.  There is, to be sure, no profanity, violence, or sexual situations.

Many viewers, particularly the Irish, may find this production politically incorrect, as some people do GONE WITH THE WIND.  The entertainment presents an utterly charming picture of life at turn of century Ireland, but the Irish rebellion is not far offthere will be revolt in 1916, less than 30 years away.  It is then made abundantly clear that the Irish hated Dublin Castle and its officials, their colonial masters. So,  obviously there is more going on beneath the surface of life in Skebawn than we are shown, though the series does occasionally show poor homes, and the tattered clothing of most of the inhabitants surely does show their poverty.  In fact, these tales are told from the viewpoint of a typically British colonial, occupying power, showing the  natives evading/outsmarting the edicts of their occupiers with charm and wit.  Many of the episodes mightve been set in almost any British colony, aside from the facts that most native Irish spoke English well; and the well-known  wit, charm, craic of that race.  Still, like GONE WITH THE WIND, this is a delightful entertainment, a top-notch snapshot of its time and place.  I actually fondly remember it from its initial run.  So, don't be silly, just dive in and enjoy it. It is, of course, unfortunately, too much material  how wonderful  for a total binge-watch, but we did  a disc a day.  And it comes to us just in time for St. Patricks Day.  Irresistible.",1455321600,5,6274,5.144685039370079
7537659,5,B017Y1GE4S,"Subtitles added to this 80s series. A well done period-perfect people drama taking place in Irish rural land as the 19th century nears an end. Period stories never go outdated, they become classic. Character development is Dickensian-like and based on real characters & events of the lives of 2 authors of the 1890s. I love Irish settings. Satirical Bally-Bliss. You get aplenty humor through great acting by many well-seasoned stars (and stars of the future), not to mention delightful Irish scenic rural panoramas shot in County Kildare. 16 hours of Masterpiece Theatre which is an endorsement in itself.
= = = Plenty of bizarre, unforgettable characters played by UK stars to perfection. Acting star power led by Peter Bowles (as Maj. Yeates the RM, Resident Magistrate) who is a must view in many of his other series like To a Manor Born; Lyttons Diary; and Rumpole of the Bailey; all recommended-to-own DVD sets. Flurry (Bryan Murray) is outstanding as his landlord full of hijinks perpetrations. Flurrys man servant Slipper (Niall Toibin) joins in the mayhem. You will find many favorite characters and guest stars.

Ah, & sure it takes but a wee bit o time til ye pick up on the Irish rural period stereotype humor. Youll LOL in brogue, right enough. I loved the Irish background music with Irish pipes. I haven't laughed this hard at the TV for a long time. 'Tis the wit o' the bog.

7537660,4,B017Y1GE4S,"Peter Bowles, as the Irish R.M (resident magistrate), is a delight to watch. Best known maybe for the series ""To the Manor Born"" with Penelope Keith,  Bowles  (herein as the R.M. Major Yeates) is a delight to watch once again. Both are worth watching.(I would add his series ""The Bounder,"" as well, to check out.)

7537666,5,B017Y1GE4S,"Good seller, no complaints! ..I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this series. Now that I have purchased it I have watched it twice. And will probably wear it out over the years!  Too funny if you like Irish and British wit in play! Horses and Hounds, beautiful country and small town characters always playing an angle... Will have you laughing every time you think of it. Priceless characters, Flurry, Old Mrs. McCarthy-Knox, Slipper, Mrs. K and Peter. A welcome escape! I will be looking for the Somerville and Ross books this was based upon.",1333065600,4,544,4.726315789473684
7537667,4,B017Y1GE4S,"'The Irish RM' catches the unique charm of the Irish - the loveable rogues and rascals, the scheming and the religious superstition all serve to make a wonderful backdrop for a charming, little series. A resident magistrate from England provides the contrast, and serves as comment, as he tries to come to make sense of the new environment in which he finds himself. While it is set at the turn of the century, I imagine that charm is timeless. The characters work beautifully together, and that with clever scripting make for a very pleasing show, and bit of escapism. So why four stars and not five? Series Three, that's why! One of the reasons why the first two series worked so well was due to the relationship between Sinclair and Phillipa, the major's touchstone. But when she disappeared from the show in the third series, and replaced with another female character (or two) it left the show lacking. The attempts at creating minor love interests, or the hint of them, don't ring true due to the bond that came through so clearly between the major and his wife. A good show that lived on a series past its sell by date, but it is classic British TV and well worth adding to your library. Best episode in my opinion is Series Two, 'A Royal Command'; low point - the silly row in the last episode.",1305936000,,1302,4.54468085106383
