8645388,4,B00ITN5QOA,"This Europakonzert is most notable for being the very first. Claudio Abbado founded this series of concerts, which takes place every May 1 in commemoration of the Berliner Philharmoniker's founding on May 1, 1882. This all-Mozart program is a winner, and both the orchestra and conductor are in their usual excellent form. The Mozart-Prague connection is a time-honored one, with Prague having gone wild over Le Nozze di Figaro, leading Mozart to give the world premiere of Don Giovanni there at the Estates Theatre, where it is still performed almost nightly. The concert on this Blu-ray was given at the Smetana Hall, one of the two main concert halls in Prague, worth noting I think because part of the appeal of the entire series of Europakonzert videos is to follow the Berliners all over Europe to some of its prime venues.

In addition to the Symphonies #29 & 35, two Mozart pieces for soprano and orchestra (with added piano in one case) are included, sung by soprano Cheryl Studer, who has a nice voice for Mozart but otherwise didn't impress me much.

It is something of a mystery to me why these videos are on Blu-ray rather than ordinary DVD, and even odder that this one appears not to be available at all as a standard-definition DVD. The source material has no qualities that an ordinary DVD could not fully convey: the video is merely broadcast TV quality from 1991, and quite inferior to the norm for a regular DVD, much less a Blu-ray. The 2-channel audio is quite excellent and really doesn't even need the qualifier ""for its time""; it's good by any standards; and if you happen to be addicted to surround sound, chances are that your receiver will do a nice job of enveloping you with nice acoustics. I say all this as a big fan of Blu-rays, which can have a tremendous visual advantage given appropriate source material; but for two-channel audio there's little, if anything that a Blu-ray can do that a regular DVD cannot. Fortunately, this Blu-ray is available at a DVD price; but not everyone has a Blu-ray player, and it seems unfair and puzzling that EuroArts would so unnecessarily limit its audience for this fine disc.

The package states that this video was ""lovingly restored and converted to High Definition video."" The viewer should always be wary of such claims; as far as I can see EuroArts has done nothing here that doesn't happen routinely in your own home, in your Blu-ray player, A/V receiver, or HDTV, or HD monitor; that's up to three up-converts already; we hardly needed EuroArts to pre-up-convert to HD. Granted, in theory, the label could have applied a more sophisticated conversion algorithm than those embedded in our playback equipment. It would be interesting to see what EuroArts started with, so as to understand what enhancement their process may have provided; but in any case the end result is substandard video even for a DVD, forget Blu-ray.

All that having been said, I still recommend the disc to those with Blu-ray players; these are fine performances in an interesting venue and on an historic occasion.",1445472000,,3066,4.8121442125237195
