Twenty-one  year-old Arlene Dahl arrived in Hollywood in 1946 she was considered to be one of the World's most beautiful screen actresses. She was once married to Lex Barker. Anthony Caruso who played Lt. Messaoud in this film was in fact a long time friend of Alan Ladd and can be found in almost a dozen of Ladd's films. The location for this desert outing was in fact Lone Pine, California; much used by Hollywood including  TARZANS DESERT MYSTERY (1943) with Johnny Weissmuller,  TARZAN'S SAVAGE FURY (1952) with Lex Barker plus many others including countless westerns. It's perhaps easy to forget that in those days Alan Ladd was extremely popular  he made the Top Money Making Stars Poll three times: in 1947, 1953 and 1954.

The film remains as it always was good clean old fashioned escapism even if it was pure hokum, providing your viewing is not ruined by a sub-standard DVD! My review of this sixty year-old film was based on a pretty good quality DVD from Australia, not on the One-Star import from Italy referred to in the Amazon. Com one and only review; at the time of writing!  Like many film of this era DESERT LEGION is now in the Public Domain and is available on DVD from Amazon UK. Any Alan Ladd fan could do a lot worse than visit <DownunderDVD.com>  for a full list of Alan Ladd films available on DVD.",1391299200,,3222,4.693262411347518
8457742,1,B0055ATAB0,"Desert Legion is a three star film...colorful, exciting, and entertaining...but the Italian DVD is terrible quality. It was obviously recorded off a TV broadcast and then transfered to DVD from video tape. The AMC logo actually appears at one point. Skip this DVD and hope that one day a legit one comes out.",1359590400,5,308,4.830188679245283
