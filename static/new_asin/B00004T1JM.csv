1349610,4,B00004T1JM,"This videotape offers on of my favorite episodes of ""The Lucy Show"" with ""Lucy and John Wayne"" (#120 November 21, 1966). Mary Jane is working at a movie studio and invites Lucy to lunch where she runs into John Wayne. Mary Jane then fixes it so Lucy can watch the Duke at work where she causes a barroom brawl that destroys the set and knocks Wayne out. This episode is even funnier than Wayne's classic appearance on ""I Love Lucy"" a decade earlier (which is also available on tape).  Then we have ""Lucy the Fight Manager"" (#130 February 20, 1967), a below average episode that has Lucy managing a fighter played by Don Rickles who wants to retire and open a flower shop. Ball and Rickles just do not click together, which is even more obvious after seeing the perfect relationships Lucy enjoyed the Duke in the previous episode.",994809600,,829,4.563758389261745
1349611,4,B00004T1JM,"Another quartet of episodes from the fifth season of ""The Lucy Show"" are offered up on Volume 3 of this video series covering Lucille Ball's second hit television series. In ""Lucy and Paul Winchell"" (Episode #114 October 3, 1966), Mr. Mooney needs a star to entertain at the show put on by the bank employees. Lucy gets ventriloquist Paul Winchell to do the gig (good), but leaves his dummies in the cab (bad), which mean Lucy has to take the place of one of the dummies named Tessie (funny). ""Lucy Goes to London"" (#116 October 17, 1966) finds Lucy winning a free trip to London when she writes the winning limerick for a dog food campaign. That is the good news. The bad news is that Mr. Mooney is on the plane with her from L.A. to New York. This was the set up for the ""Lucy in London"" hour-long special shot on location. That is one they should put out on tape, just for the proto-music video of the song ""Lucy in London"" written by Phil Spector. ""Lucy and the Monkey"" (#122 December 5, 1966) has Lucy so overworked at the bank that Mary Jane predicts she is going to start hallucinating. So when a chimp gets left in Mr. Mooney's office, Lucy thinks that her boss has obviously been turned into a monkey. This episode, also known as ""Mooney the Monkey"" by those with a love for alliteration, is another one of those that sounds better than it plays. Since Lucy spends so much time getting out of work, you wonder how much she would have to work to actually be ""overworked."" There are better episodes of Lucy with monkeys, just not on this tape. ""Lucy and the Ring A Ding Ding"" (#115 October 10, 1966), recycles the bit where Lucy gets a ring stuck on her finger. This time it is the diamond ring Mr. Mooney bought for his wife Irma. What makes this episode funny, however, is when he gives Lucy a tranquilizer to relax her fingers and ends up having to deal with getting the ring off the finger of the sedated redhead. The first episode is the best one on this tape, while the rest are things we have seen Lucy do before and do better.",994032000,,2041,4.345549738219895
1349612,5,B00004T1JM,"All the Lucy shows that Lucy did where just as funny, wonderful, and good as the ""I Love Lucy"" series. They are made in color and are really good. This volume is great and I recommend this volume to anyone. It is a great way to get started on Lucy videos or a great addition to any Lucy collection!

1349618,4,B00004T1JM,"There is little doubt that this series was aimed at the 'young kids' demographic. The violence is entirely cartoonish, there's not a drop of blood to be seen anywhere, and the relationships are all entirely 'pure'... however, that doesn't mean that this great show can't be enjoyed by teenagers and above.

The wacky sense of humor, the action-packed (though bloodless) battles, and the unique mixture of japanese animation and western-style cartoon, all help to make this show well worth the price of admission. From 'Monster-of-the-Week' style action, to season-long dramatic arcs, Teen Titans deliver! It's also worth adding that this particular collection - encompassing seasons 1-to-3 - covers the best days of the Teen Titans. It only goes downhill in the last two seasons, so if you're gonna enjoy the TT, this is the place to do it.",1188691200,,840,5.086956521739131

1349627,5,B00004T1JM,THIS TAPE IS GOOD.IT HAS GOOD PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY AND IT ALSO FEATURES SOME CLASSIC COMMERCIALS. ALLTHOUGH THE COMMERCIALS ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL ONE'S FROM THE SHOW I ENJOYED WATCHING IT.,1107648000,,192,5.03125
1349628,1,B00004T1JM,"I purchased these,not noticing the ""Sound Enhanced"" warning on them.  The quality is OK (not the greatest but it'll do) BUT...the opening and closing theme music is replaced with an AWFUL version that sounds NOTHING like the original.  The only reason I can figure for them doing this is that perhaps they were unable to obtain rights to air the theme song (for one reason or another).  Aside from that, this is a collection of episodes NOT WORTH BUYING imo.  AMC must now stand for Awful Movie Collection.  If this were a movie, it'd be awful!",1101254400,8,544,4.625
1349629,2,B00004T1JM,"This features the classic episodes from the later years of the Lucy Show, which if anyone has seen the entire series, the best of the series was during the first two season with Vivian Vance nad the original ""I Love Lucy"" writers.  But, the DVD set is absolutely horrendous when it comes to playback quality.  The picture quality is worse than a good VHS copy!  The color is faded on a lot, and there seems to be some problems with syncing voice and picture on some episodes.  Unfortunately, no one has a great Lucy Show set, so there aren't that many better options.  Get it if you're curious, but be prepared for terrible video picture.",1095638400,5,638,4.51304347826087
1349630,2,B00004T1JM,"When it comes to public domain material you just have to hope for the best.

Certain episodes of The Lucy Show are avalable on several public domain labels. The quality of some are better than the others.

Since the source material for these shows are often 16mm films, you can never expect the crisp quality of say, the new ""Here's Lucy"" set (which was transfered from Lucy's children's 35mm prints of the shows and looks awesome). I really don't mind that though. if the print is a bit old and looks like it's been used a lot, it reminds me of the way it used to be shown on local syndication in the 1970's.

But what should be done is to at least take care to make as good a DVD transfer as possible.

What we get on these AMC discs is 7 episodes per disc. Usually, that's good news, most tv show releases put 8 shows per dual layer disc.

For the newbe, dual layer discs have 2 layers of digital storage information per side. The more space on the DVD that can be used for the video, the more movement will look natural and it will avoid ""pixalation', the blocky look that digital video sometimes exhibits if the amount of memory used for the scene is too low.

Trouble is, these discs with 7 episodes are SINGLE layer discs. So, that means that they crammed 2 to 3 times as much audio/video on a single layer than most studios would ever dream of doing.

At nearly 3 hours on a single layer, you can see blocking and pixalation much of the time. The memory of the DVD cannot keep up with some of the movement in the video and that is the result.

The transfers themselves are fair (remembering what I said before about public domain transfers) but the quality is unforgivably compromised by overloading the single layer DVD

I really hope someday a more ligit season by season release of this series will be coming (transfered from 35mm) but until then, this is not a sutable substitute.

Buy, AMC used to be a quality network. There participation in the Vertigo VHS, Laserdisc and DVD releases lended that much more credibility to the quality of the product.

now, not only has thier network gone down hill, they endorse really dreadful quality DVD's",1094860800,18,2156,4.446700507614213

1349633,2,B00004T1JM,"YWhen you have the Queen of Comedy and the heir to her throne
playing opposite each other,the expectations would be somewhere along the lines of earth shattering fireworks,so the first entry of this tape(""Lucy finds a Roomate"") is something of a letdown. The first impression I got from viewing this episode for the first time was that you keep waiting for their scenes to crackle with the fire youd come to come to expect from these two Ladies of Laughter and that just does not not come to happen. Of course thats no fault of its stars,who,on the contrary,gamely try to rise above the medicre,second rate material,and,at times,even succeed. Still,theres no denying that these two stars are working with a less than great script,certainly undeserving
of the talents of Lucy and Carol. As for the second episode(""Lucy and Carol go to Palm Springs""),the results are even more discouraging,and I can only say that the culprit her seems not only to be a hopelessluy contrived,unfunny screenplay with lackluster direction to match. Once again,its the performancesof Lucy and Carol trying to breathe some life into this that are the only saving grace here. I just cannot agree with the customer reviews that find the ""Lucy and Carol Go To Palm Springs Episode hilarious. This is so absurd. I expected much,much more from this considering its stars.
