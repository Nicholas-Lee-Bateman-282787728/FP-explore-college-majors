8390127,1,B0036Q2RQ0,"Of course, if you are looking for ABSOLUTELY nothing you're sure to find it...similar to believing there is no GOD....there is NO DVD in this case...but if you are a good dancer you can make up your own moves...and PRETEND something exists.",1349049600,6,240,4.738095238095238
8390128,1,B0036Q2RQ0,If there was a 0 star rating I would have gave that!  I bought the Irish dancing video as a gift to my granddaughters. It was a huge disappointment when they opened the wrapped DVD box and it didn't have a DVD inside. I reported it and Amazon sent a second one. Yes there was a DVD in the box this time and it doesn't work in the DVD player. Sad granddaughter faces again :(. Now I'm sick of dealing with it!,1348185600,5,408,3.975609756097561
