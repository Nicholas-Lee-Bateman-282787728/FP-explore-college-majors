8098396,1,B000CEVCCO,"I ordered two different videos from the old 1950's TV series ""Decoy"" starring Beverly Garland.  Ms. Garland had just passed away in December, and I, being a fan of hers had discovered the name of this program while reading her obit.  One vloume had four episodes, while the other had five.  Unfortunately three of the same episodes in the first video were the exact same epsidodes on the second volume.  One would have thought that there would have been no chance of overlap between the two videos, given that there were enough different episodes from two seasons of the show to choose from.  It was almost a waste of money to buy the second video.  This was a very poor job of packaging these volumes.",1231718400,8,702,4.576
8098397,3,B000CEVCCO,"Decades before Angie Dickinson starred in ""Policewoman"", TV saw it's very first tough female cop - Beverly Garland in the vintage 1950's television series DECOY. In what must have been quite an unusual sight for audiences of the period (a time when the most an actress ever played on TV was a housewife or secretary), DECOY highlighted the work of a jobbing police-woman on the 'beat' in New York City.

Casey Jones (Beverly Garland) doles out justice to drug-pushers, petty thieves and more in these four episodes. Quality is typical Alpha; those who regularly buy from this label know what to expect. On the upswing, their selection of 1950's TV shows is one of the best and most varied; and a lot of what they offer isn't available anywhere else.

Episodes:

""The Comeback"" -  Peter Falk guest stars as a racetrack teller who keeps a deadly secret regarding counterfeit betting tickets.

""Tin Pan Payoff"" - An up-and-coming singer goes from demo record to police record when a popular songwriter is murdered.

""Ghost of Van Gogh"" - A Svengali-like gallery owner manipulates a deranged artist to create forgeries of rare paintings.

""Blind Date"" - Two female tourists are found unconscious with a suitcase containing over a hundred thousand dollars. Casey must play the women against each other in order to discover where the money came from.",1155513600,5,1344,4.946666666666666
