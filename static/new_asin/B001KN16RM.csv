It captures beautifully the ecstatic love for the Divine that permeates Rumi's poetry. A must-see for anyone interested in Sufism and/or Rumi's poetry.",1496793600,,316,4.981132075471698
8315383,5,B001KN16RM,"This is a beautifully made film with a profoundly peaceful message for the contemporary world. The filmmakers, Cynthia Lukas and Kell Kearns, have done meticulous research and have traveled extensively to create their documentaries. Because of this, they convey their deep understanding of the poet's life and luminous work.",1496707200,,324,5.63265306122449
8315384,5,B001KN16RM,"I found ""Rumi Returning"" to be truly mesmerizing! Rumi's profound poetry & the story of the life he lived; the astounding beauty of the Turkish landscapes, the music, & the cultural/religious ceremonies; & the philosophical & ethical issues raised, all combined to make the viewing of this film quite riveting.",1496102400,,310,5.22

8315388,3,B001KN16RM,"This documentary was produced with funds from the Turkish government, and not surprisingly it adopts a pro Muslim perspective. The pro Muslim propaganda is very subtly woven with the actual documentary about Rumi and his poetry.",1413244800,,228,5.361111111111111
8315389,5,B001KN16RM,"Rumi Returning  is a remarkable collage of music, visual artistry, and informative dialogue.  It situates Rumi in his Afghan-Persian-Turkish milieu, giving the viewer a clear geographical, historical, and religious sense of Rumi in the thirteenth century. The film incorporates actual footage from Rumi's tomb in Konya, Turkey, and records the ""whirling dervishes"" in action. Throughout there is a creative use of Persian miniatures and a nuanced contextualization of sufism and Islam. Of all the films made about Rumi to date this is the only one I would show to my university students without any reservations.",1229558400,17,612,5.431578947368421
8315390,5,B001KN16RM,"The spirit of Rumi is the intangible gift this movie offers viewers of every sacred tradition.  Where once we valued religious tolerance, and then interfaith understanding, now in the timeless mystical witness of Rumi we are able to experience the spiritual unity we all so much hope to awaken in civilization.",1228262400,10,310,5.078431372549019
8315391,5,B001KN16RM,"Breathtakingly, beautiful movie about the life & legacy of Rumi.  Cynthia Lukas & Kell Kearns have expertly woven together a masterpiece of visual & spiritual delight - the scenes in Konya, Turkey are interspersed with expert testimonials from Akbar Ahmed, Coleman Barks, and others which explain the significance of Rumi's poetry which transcends religion.

It's a lovely reminder to Muslims about the beauty which lies within Islam...poetry, music, and dance all have a place within the practice of religion if one chooses to open one's heart & mind to the possibility of God who can be found both within & all around.  Truly a delightful movie to encourage interfaith dialogue - thank you for this gift!",1227830400,10,706,5.068965517241379
