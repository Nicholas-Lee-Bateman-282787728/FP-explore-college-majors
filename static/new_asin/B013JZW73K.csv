7367937,3,B013JZW73K,"Absolutely Anything is kind of a like an 80's British afternoon kids show for the most part, although it does have a bit of nudity and genital jokes in it.  The aliens look terrible, and very low budget CGI, but they are voiced by John Cleese and the Monty Python actors. So if you're a fan of their work, perhaps your mind can forgive the low budget aliens' appearance.  Robin Williams does voice Dennis the dog but he doesn't talk for a great amount of time in the film.  There is actually an attempted suicide scene in the movie which Dennis tries to stop, which is a bit odd when you know what happened in real life.  Absolutely Anything is okay, I'd never even heard of it before coming across it so I didn't have any expectations but with the cast it has, it probably could have been better.  I also couldn't help but think, haven't we seen this same plot before with Jim Carey or Adam Sandler, perhaps both.

Neil (Pegg's character) who is through a random assigning, given the power to basically have his wishes come true.  He can change people into animals, reanimate the dead, command aliens to wipe out his class of misbehaving students, make a person worship another, basically he can do whatever he wants. However like a lot of wish movies, he needs to be really clear and exact in what he wishes for, otherwise there will be wish side affects.  Conveniently he just happens to be having a conversation with a fellow teacher who asks what would you do if you have the power to do anything.  But overall Neil doesn't get up to a great deal with these powers at all.  Then we've got Grant who is the ultimate stalker who just won't take no for an answer from the woman (Kate Beckinsale) who lives downstairs from Neil, Neil also wants a relationship with her but is too socially clumsy to get anywhere.  This guy was so cartoon bad guy stereotype, you could predict what was going to happen to him.

Absolutely Anything is a movie that when it's over is the type you're not really going to remember much about  it in six months time, let alone probably next week.  It doesn't have any iconic, lets talk about that scene when you find out someone else has watched the movie too that this sort of movie should be full of.  It'll pass an hour and a half of your time well enough, you might laugh a couple of times, but overall you won't be too impressed.  Perhaps its better to wait for this to be on TV one day, although the nudity scenes and genital references will probably be edited out if it was in the early evening time slot as the family movie time slot is pretty much the demographic that would get the most out of this movie.",1460937600,,2643,4.374233128834356

Pegg's character and his dog (voiced by Robin Williams) must unknowingly contend with the will of the Intergalactic Council (voiced by Monty Python). Apparently savaged by critics, Absolutely Anything actually yields a high laugh per minute ratio (its sole intent!), so I'm politely saying the critics can go to hell. Yes, Absolutely Anything could have done, well, absolutely anything... but more is not always better.

4 stars instead of 5 because Beckinsale's character was given a backstory not capitalized upon, resulting in her sole function as a sex object for Pegg, Robert Bathurst, and Rob Riggle (a disappointing role reversal if you know her as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld-film-series/dp/B007FFUMKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld film series</a>&nbsp;action star). It's almost as if the studio told director Terry Jones that he needed to cut 10 minutes out of the flick, and Beckinsale's character is what's now on the cutting room floor.

Still, I'm recommending Absolutely Anything for fans of Pegg and/or Beckinsale, and if you'd like to see the last role (albeit voice only) of the late great Robin Williams, for better or worse.",1449964800,4,1251,5.868131868131868

The film has potential and it had its moments. The absolute powers follow precise speech with no regard to consequences. I kept waiting for the film to get better and have the big laugh. It didn't happen. The high point was using the cast of Monty Python as the voices for aliens.

The movie looked better in the trailers, and I gave up pretty quickly into the movie.

I'll give it another try, because I love the cast.  Also, I think this is re-releasing in 2017 for the US market.  Maybe?  Not sure.",1499731200,,323,4.112903225806452

Not up to the higher standard set by all the talent involved such as Robin Williams, Eddie Izzard, & the Monty Python crew. And that I think is the real reason for some of the poor reviews. But if one wants to spend an evening of entertainment watching this, it is worth it in my book.",1499385600,5,365,4.154929577464789

The basic concept of a common man getting omnipotence is the same, but the approach at best parallel, and at worst, mediocre computer generated sight gags.  If I had to pick my biggest complaint, it would be that with all that talent, this is all they could achieve?

Between Pegg, Williams, and the Python Alumni, there was some serious comedy muscle.  What we got was a lukewarm episode of the Simpsons.",1499040000,,459,4.772151898734177

7368057,5,B013JZW73K,"6-27-17 Wow are the negative reviews incorrect......enjoyed this one as much as my Pegg favs.....so glad I bought it.....after several bad purchases in a row that Amazon sucker punched me with.

I did not expect to enjoy every joke and be okay with all the exaggerations.  I was.

6-29-17 2nd viewing surprisingly nice -- each set piece still held me in ""their now,"" and I seldom wandered into recalling any of the film before I saw it again.  That's a validation.

7-5-17 3rd time was charming for sure.  The pacing really keeps the attention.  Writing is better each time.  For instance: ""perfect.""  Nice.

7-15-17 4th viewing was pretty much known in every manner, but I still enjoyed it all -- pacing is brisk.  Some flaws and frays showed up, but they were minor.  Next viewing whenever, but hope to hold off and forget at least some of the elements....but it's hard wired in me now.....fat chance.

7-24-17 5th viewing nine days later . . . don'tchu be lookin' at me.  This film just owns me.  It has many elements -- any one of which would attract me to any film.  Owned.  But though a fanboy of Pegg, I really don't like 30% of his works.  Next viewing doubtlessly will be years from now.  LAUGHING ARE YOU?  See?  It's the psychic reach of its humor hegemony.

8-7-17 6th viewing still got me entertained a lot.  Not bad.  So many viewings in a short time period....yet it delivered.",1498521600,8,1392,4.565040650406504
7368058,4,B013JZW73K,"Critics have said that Terry Jones' latest film is a disappointment, considering this is likely his last film.  I would say the real disappointment is that with the sun setting on Terry Jones' career, the critics of our day are still as bloodthirsty, ruthless, and petty as they have always been and that he has to suffer for it. If you aren't aware, his mental condition is such that Jones no longer has the capacity for speech/communication; it's like a variation of Parkinson's - he is still in good physical health otherwise (John Cleese and Eric Idle have only recently made this public on their most recent tour together). Now I'm not saying that because of Jones' condition that they should take it easy on him; I'm saying that they've always been hypercritical and they fact that they are taking it out on a sick old man is just extra vile. Add to that what may now truly be Robin Williams' swan[dog] song and the last reunion of the 5 living Pythons onscreen and we have ourselves a travesty - this film never had a chance to be welcomed as all the talents involved deserved.

 It's not the most unique premise, to be certain - summing it up easiest would be ""a secular Bruce Almighty"". Jokes and gags are clever, cheeky, and kept me chuckling throughout. Honestly, I don't know how anyone could not laugh when Simon Pegg's wishes are hilariously misinterpreted. Seriously, did I mention Simon Pegg is in this? If you are a fan, that should be enough to pique your interest and it's quite an entertaining hour and 25 minute jaunt.",1495843200,2,1539,4.609489051094891
