5130386,4,B0084BM7NK,"Now and then along comes a film that is far more adventuresome than the PR suggests and such is the case of the very well constructed AUGUST. Written and directed by Eldar Rapaport (with Brian Sloan) this is a hard look at love relationships and how the test of time influences the success or failure of commitment. The choice of title reflects the generated heat of contentious relationships and just happens to be set in the time of the infamous Station Fire in Southern California in 2009, the largest and deadliest of the multiple wildfires, burning 160,577 acres (or 251 square miles), destroying countless homes, and killing two firefighters - a time when the Los Angeles basin was without electricity, full of smoke and ashes, and all nerves were on edge regarding the carnage.

Jonathan (Daniel Dugan) and Raul (Adrian Gonzalez) are a contented couple: though they live separately (Raul has married Jonathan's best friend Nina - Hilary Banks - for immigration purposes so they must maintain separate homes) they are devoted to each other and Raul is in the process of planning Jonathan's 30th birthday party. As an unexpected development Troy (Murray Bartlett), Jonathan's ex-boyfriend who has been living in Spain for several years after a painful breakup, arrives in Los Angeles at the height of the heat wave and moves in with his married brother Sean (Bernhard Forcher) and family. Troy calls Jonathan, arranges a meeting for coffee but is sure that Raul will enter the coffee shop to demonstrate the Jonathan is in a committed relationship. But old flames simmer and soon Troy is convincing the not unwilling Jonathan to rekindle their old passion, a liaison that becomes apparent to Raul. At Jonathan's 30th birthday party Nina and her chef boyfriend Nick (Mike Vaughn) invite Troy and Troy's good friend Devon (Brad Standley), and by the end of the evening the group hits the bars to smoke pot and drink.  Raul then invites Troy to their home to join Jonathan and him in a physical liaison that results in Troy's `wakeup call' about commitment as he sees the degree of passion between Raul and Jonathan: Troy as an outsider steps away and eventually returns to Spain - but we never know what will occur next.

AUGUST is blessed with a very fine cast of excellent actors who are able to pull off the intimacy of the story with decorum.  There are some problems with the film: the director loses the audience with what feels like inadvertent non-linear storyline that disrupts the flow of the story, and the editor of the film David Au has cut and spliced the film in a disturbing and distracting manner. The musical score by Yuval Ron is heated Middle Eastern in flavor and at times covers the dialogue. But the story works in large part because of the exceptional acting and appeal of Murray Bartlett, Daniel Dugan, and Adrian Gonzalez.  As the PR states, ` It is an irresistible gay romantic drama!

A beautifully shot film, it stays with you after it's over. The leads are charismatic and make you root for them, even if you don't necessarily like their behavior.

August is languid and steamy, with the L.A. summer heat playing a key role. The ever-rising sexual tension between the characters is intense, palpable, and most important, truly believable; no small feat in cinema.

Not a feel good rom-com, but a treatise on lost love and sexual heat, August is definitely worth watching and buying.",1338681600,11,710,6.161616161616162

5130395,4,B0084BM7NK,"Murray Bartlett brings a certain angst to his character that is poignant.  His character's struggle to to grow up, discover who he is as an individual, and realizing you can't recapture the past is the central theme to the film.  Yes, these elements have been told in many gay themed films but it is Murray Bartlett's acting that gives this story its interest. The other actors in the film are as good in showing their character's development, but the story centers around Murray Bartlett's character, so that has been my primary focus in this review.

5130400,3,B0084BM7NK,"The most striking thing about this movie is how it was shot. It's pretty impressive and you can sense that there's a certain deliberateness to every frame - the director had a clear idea of how he wanted each and every scene to come across. This doesn't ensure that every sequence comes across as meaningful though - a lot of times it feels like it's trying really hard but it's not entirely certain about what it wants to say. And this continues on with sequences that drag on because of highly stylized sequences.

The story in itself is familiar enough - we all have that sort of ""bad boy"" ex-partner that you'll always have some feelings for even though it makes no logical sense. These are the guys who hurt us the most and yet still you seem to  be able to gloss over those past sins one you get caught up in the heat of the moment. And this movie does a decent job of depicting these moments in a manner that still feels more like art than soft core porn.

The acting talent was highly inconsistent in this movie, which is a shame given the goals of the story. Sometimes it's hard to understand the emotional rationale for some of the decisions since many of the actors come across a little flat or unemotional. There's a strong tendency to mumble out lines in an order to sound more introspective or something and that just gets in the way of understanding things.

As a boyfriend, Raul is both attractive and pathetic. He's a major doormat for most of the movie and it's not entirely clear why he lets things go on for as long as they do. The scene involving the haircut totally merited a stronger response than what he did and it's hard to understand why he didn't do more.

The movie ends on an odd note, but I suppose this is consistent with what one might expect from a movie of this nature. There's a goal to appear as more of an art film than it actually once, but you have to give credit for the ambition behind the movie. But for those looking for lighter reasons to watch this movie, there's a fair amount of eye candy and the fact the movie is set in the middle of a summer heatwave means a lot of excuses to walk around shirtless.

August isn't exactly bad - but it does feel a tad pretentious at times as it tries to accomplish so much. But despite how the movie stretches out, the story in itself is pretty simple and perhaps there's a degree of elegance in that fact.",1420588800,,2390,4.311804008908686
5130401,3,B0084BM7NK,"While the premise rings realistic, I had hoped for the confliction of all three major characters, particularly Jonathan and Troy, to become more expressive and self-evident. It just never seemed to come to fruition. No raw emotion, no well-defined backstory on why we should care about Jonathan and Troy as a a potential couple. A lot of elements missing in my opinion that could have solidified some decent acting.",1420156800,,415,5.028985507246377

It's LA and it's hot, get it? I liked the second lead Daniel Dugan who i'm guessing is the son of actor Dennis Dugan who married Cybill Shepherd on an episode of Moonlighting.

5130406,2,B0084BM7NK,"I'm somewhat amazed that the Murray Bartlett from HBO's Looking is the same guy on the cover of the poster. After watching the film, I'm somewhat amazed he was able to convince them to cast him. This is a very dry and inert melodrama about wanting your ex when they conveniently return after you've moved on, and all the drama which comes after you start an affair against your better judgment.

That the film takes itself so seriously is its major flaw. Then there's the dry acting from all involved, as well as presenting LA in a really dull if semi-realistic way. The heat wave in the film only makes the whole affair uncomfortable, as opposed to hot. If you want uncomfortable over hot, then this is for you.

The way the filmmaker explores this story and the feelings of the actors as they go through their process is really interesting.  A lot of the film shows the characters thinking, contemplating, observing.  There is a lot of gold in what is not said.

Yes I know sometimes people choose the wrong person for the wrong reason.

5130414,1,B0084BM7NK,"Seriously, while I wanted to have liked this film it was really just horrendous.  The music is beautiful but it feels entirely out of place the vast majority of the time.  The characters have no development, zip, zilch, nada - really just what appears to be impossibly hip/beautiful/bohemian group of seemingly shallow people.  The story drags at an amazingly slow pace while you want to find out more about the past, whatever ""is"" the magic of Troy, just any bit of depth of characters?  The lead spanish actor is beautiful to look at and while you should want to feel badly for him because of his multiple problems in life, his situation is hard to be believed as he complains about not being able to get a ""real"" job as he needs citizenship while apparently living in a cozy, pricey almost Martha Stewart designed condo/loft in Sunset Lakes California?!?!?!?!

If you enjoy soft gay porn there are a few scenes that were so-so but most of the time you wanted to look away because the story was so overly dramatic and the characters were really not very likable unless you were in the ""impossibly hip/beautiful/bohemian group of seemingly shallow people"" type crowd who frequents Indian themed smoke houses with belly dancers mentioned earlier.  Really just hard to believe.

It's essentially an unfulfilling mess of 98 minutes that was fairly difficult to sit through.  LOL!",1394496000,2,1377,4.854700854700854
5130415,4,B0084BM7NK,"First, let me address some of the negative reviews for perspective (I know, this is not a chat room, but some are just ridiculous). Many negative reviews have noted the lack of dialog in some scenes but that is due in part to the film maker's choice to create an air of mystique around the leads (a plus and minus but more on that below). One negative reviewer only looks for happy endings (what are you five years old?). This same reviewer gave the abortion ""Saltwater"" four stars so be wary. Others dismiss the whole movie because of the bad Troy character. So I guess the Tragedies of Shakespeare should all get one star? Another accuses the film maker of using Spanish in a scene as a sign of a weak plot. WTF?!?! I'll have more to say on that below. OK, rant over.

First off, the basic premise of the movie is a clich (Old flame (Troy)comes back and makes trouble for his EX(Jonathan)and his lover(Raul)) but the approach and execution is unique, making use of non-linear time, body language and a naturalistic presentation (similar to the movie Weekend). However,this movie is a challenge because its major strengths are also its major flaws being mindful that this is an extension of a short film and thus in need of character and plot development (again, a strength AND weakness). The two major strengths are also the films major weaknesses; a focused director and a great cast of REAL actors. Murray Bartlett (Troy) is riveting in this movie. In the opening scene, where he is undergoing a job interview, he absolutely nails the anxiety one feels when being challenged in an interview and makes it look effortlessly real (would that this is the case in all movies as opposed to the horrifically overpaid bodies with an impressive voice and a limited bag of acting tricks phoning in their performance). At last, a handsome actor with a hot body who can ACT! Independent gay film makers take note-it IS possible. It is clear that he and the director/film maker have worked to create a character of mystique, the guy you love to hate or want to hate but..., and Bartlett is living that character in every scene. In this case, the director/writer and actor, working in concert, hit the bull's eye. This approach is less successful for the other two roles in the triangle. It seems the director and Daniel Duggan, who plays Jonathan, decided to add depth to his role by focusing on the emotional damage (and the  behavioral consequence)Troy laid on him too much rather than the emotional romantic connection these two characters have. This leaves Jonathan seeming distant and one dimensional. As one reviewer noted, why are the two hunks into this guy? Yes, Jonathan is cute and has a nice body but that's a dime a dozen in West Hollywood. Where is the depth-the lure? As a result of this plot point underwriting and dark psych analysis turned into characterization for the Jonathan character, many paint Troy (the more intense of the two) as this villain while giving Jonathan a victim pass overlooking the fact that Jonathan is the one who pounces on Troy and keeps going back for more (no one can take you where you won't go). When Jonathan tells Troy, ""I think you're the devil"", it reeks of the old ""The Devil made me do it"" cop out. Duggan is clearly a good actor. If he had been given some more back story and scenes of real engagement with Troy and Raul, I have little doubt he could have fleshed out this character more and added needed dimension not just to his role but also to the dynamic with Troy/Raul. Development is also needed for Raul although he proves cunning himself in that he confronts Troy at a party by speaking in Spanish (Troy has been away in Barcelona so Raul makes an assumption that proves to be correct). Speaking in a language not spoken by most at a party is an ideal way of having an unpleasant chat stay private (not a bad plot ploy Amazon reviewer Einstein) and the scene is full of tension delivered with brilliant understatement. These two actors nail it again here. However, why does Raul end up compelling a threesome? While it shocks Troy into backing off, it really pushes Jonathan over the edge and shuts him emotionally down, imparting as much damage, if not more it would seem, as the dalliances with Troy. There should have been a greater attempt by Raul to connect with Jonathan and get him to address his continued connection with Troy or perhaps scenes of Raul getting more background info on Troy from the party guests, some of whom were unhappy to see Troy back (again, a lost opportunity for more needed backstory).

This underwriting of the main characters to create a mystique (which does add style) works against the main trio dynamic as all three need more development outside of the trio to add unique character depth (a good actor can only do so much). The script filling tries to provide this with Jonathan's work friend marrying Raul to give him citizenship and Troy's supportive brother. The scene where Troy's straight brother tries to talk sense into him (stop screwing with your Ex and get a real boyfriend, start a career, be an uncle to my kid...) is effective and moving but so much more is needed. Here was an opportunity to delve into how two siblings from the same family are so different and why one is so damaged with relationship building. A great opportunity lost. However, the film maker in an interview said he might want to make a follow up called September and he would focus on Troy and his brother because Bartlett and the actor playing the brother worked so well together. Now that shows promise indeed.

Another oddity was noted by another reviewer; if you are showing sex scenes (and they are HOT-in an interview, Bartlett intimated that he and Duggan had a tryst at one time and used that), why have the leads wear boxers/briefs post coitus? If they didn't want to do the full Monty (a shame, no, criminal!) then let them stay under the covers or just film with the camera above the waists. Sounds like knit picking but there are too many loose threads and lost opportunities which invites this.

So, with all the above, why the four stars? This is an independent film and my background makes me aware of the great challenges facing independent film makers. As such, I give more allowances to them than I do the big $$$ dreck that comes out of Hollywood's rear end. This doesn't mean I suffer high school level acting or mediocre craft. The film  maker and team have worked hard on this film in a short time frame (typical of independent films)and they do deliver something head and shoulders above the love story crap that passes for profundity and art in too many independent films (gay and straight). All in all, I feel the movie's strengths rise above the negatives. The actors do more with what they are given, the characters are shown as full fledged individuals with jobs, friends and family. Though the premise is a clich, the movie is blessedly free of gay theme clichs (no drag queens, no plucky comedic queens, no gym or locker room scenes but with one exception being that Troy goes to a bar that Raul just happens to work at), has interesting background music and the director has style and sets scenes well. Consider the ending restaurant scene with Troy standing between the seated lovers and Raul's shrewd departing line ""We'll miss you"". The scene is golden as is Bartlett's reaction as Troy. But that too is another of the film's strengths/foibles; lots of greatly done scenes but not enough story filling to hold them together and build the film as a whole. The film asks its audience to fill in too many blanks where more detail is needed. Still, there is way more good than bad here. Give this movie a shot and try not to get pulled into the flaws but into the strengths of which there are many (especially compared to most gay independent movies). If you only want a happy ending with all the ends tied, stick with Disney and leave this for the adults.",1394064000,,7964,4.628712871287129

A beautifully realized film-- a guy's life is thrown into disarray when his ex comes back to town, and they find the spark between them isn't exactly dead.

5130454,3,B0084BM7NK,"Overall, I liked the film. The only thing is the plot of this movie seems to be the plot of several movies in the gay film genre.

The main character in the film is in a relationship with another man who is married for citizenship purposes only. Think Green Card, but not the ending. After a five year breakup with the main character's first boyfriend, he returns from Barcelona, Spain to try and pick up where they left off. He does not realize that the primary character is emotionally involved with the other man. You can guess what happens in the end ( no pun intended). Basically the guy from Spain goes home after causing problems and that pretty much sums up the movie. I don't want to tell to much and spoil this for someone who wants to see the movie. Others may think it is five star worthy, but it was just average to me.

I would recommend this movie to the audience that would enjoy gay cinema. I am glad we have it, but it reminds me of several movies we own with the same or similar plot. It is worth a look, but don't get your hopes up with the amount of nudity. I think it was well made, the plot was there, and the movie was well made. I do think however think that the leading role was not the best choice of actors. I realize, if I'm not mistaken, he was in the original short this movie is based on, but he seemed a little dull for the role.",1361404800,,1362,4.1358490566037736

That's a pretty interesting plate full and should make for a great gay movie unless you realize, 30 minutes into its plodding development, you have begun looking at the clock and/or your own loving boyfriend of 5 years has taken to playing a videogame on his phone while snuggled together on the couch. Oh, and how does it turn out? Near the thankful end 29-year-old buys an air conditioner to let Raul know that he has won out. Raul deserves better one has to surmise since we know little about him either. There is no successful 2-way passion demonstrated between the 2 of them anywhere in the film. Architect ex skulks out of town and returns to Spain and Raul and 29-year-old express their domestic bliss by pushing tomatoes from one plate to the other's in a restaurant (kudos to a well filmed scene I must begrudgingly admit).

So what is missing here is any character development, any character back-story showing some humanity (unless narcissism IS L.A. filmmakers' idea of humanity)nor any other reason to care about the pretty bodies parading across the screen and bed sheets.  I really wanted to be drawn in but I was not. The slight bit of personality to be found in the film at all is in the peripheral straight characters.

Murray Bartlett (Troy) provided the most nuanced performance of the three, and he is the most experienced actor of the trio.

First you hated one in the triangle and next time you disliked or loved another. Each one made a point to do something that was really endearing or disliked and next it was another. Perplexing to put it mildly. I guess I am still confused. However, when a movie leaves me room for thought and a desire to see it again when in the mood, I would recommend it. I actually don't even remember why it is titled August. It was something that I must have understood a few viewings ago and now just think what the character see in it.

5130475,3,B0084BM7NK,"The diagnosis of hysteria refers to free floating affects, to feelings disconnected from what they mean and so taken as seriously as if feelings were truth, or at least facts.  I guess actors have learned how to appear sincere by tearing up; great technique, guys.  This movie tries to treat such decorator affects as dignified and serious, but only shows how vapid they really are. ""August"" has a lot of heart and sincerity and attractive actors, but is important because of its naive, direct depiction of the emptiness papered over with superficiality that is gay love as movies often portray it.
The only character in the movie with any verbally expressible sense is Troy's straight brother Josh, who correctly diagnoses Troy as a shallow manipulator messing with other people's lives.  The opening scene in which Troy is subjected to a job interview makes it very clear that Troy is a fraud.  The question is, why does Jonathan love Troy to the extent of risking his relationship with sober and gorgeous Raoul?  The made for TV answer is that Jonathan aspires to be like Troy, as Troy is some one who does ""not give a s..t"".  Troy has nothing to offer Jonathan except his solid looks and manifest insincerity .
 The clincher: (spoiler alert) Raoul proves his love for spineless Jonathan by making love to both Jonathan and Troy, revealing Troy as the cad he is, and driving Troy out of the country.  Way to go, Raoul!!

5130476,4,B0084BM7NK,"""August"" is actually based on, as far as I know, a short film (Postmortem), by the same film director Eldar Rapaport. I have often wished that certain short films would indeed go on to develop characters and take the story to a place that is often-- in the short film context-- only intimated, suggested or simply left to the imagination of the viewer. Interestingly, Postmortem (the short), lends itself to a fuller treatment and I think for the most part, it works well.  Here in ""August"" we get the characters fleshed-out in all their full ""lack of character"" beauty. These guys not only have feet of clay, but hearts and brains of putty. It is such a cliche. Good-looking guy, who can have anyone he wants is beginning to age and reflects on a life of no commitment. He lands on the one person who really loved him and whom he 5 years ago turned-away. Back in LA from Spain, he shows up, out of the blue to rekindle the flame, even though the man of his intent is in another relationship that is really complicated by his status in this country as a legal alien. This part of the story is very rich and involves other interesting characters all intertwined beautifully by honest, real emotions, concerns and dreams. I loved how the film ends. It was real, not phony and packs a real punch for all those folks out there, who just don't take relationships seriously or when they finally do, it's too late. What really matters is a person's character and commitment. There is little else to sustain one, once the exterior beauty and charm fade.",1350432000,13,1545,4.557553956834532
5130477,3,B0084BM7NK,"Jonathan, a shortish, homely-ish, 29-year-old, minimally employed nebbish in LA, has a tall, gorgeous (but shallow and manipulative), 40-ish ex-boyfriend, Troy - who dumped him five years earlier but for some reason has moved back from Barcelona just to get him back. BUT... Jonathan has an even MORE gorgeous (breathtakingly gorgeous) twentysomething current boyfriend, Raul - who is not only gorgeous but sweet, strong, sincere and totally devoted to him. Right away you say to yourself, this is just like real life, just like me and the two incredible hunks who can't get enough of me. What's a homely nebbish girl to do? That's the dilemma in this movie that I really wanted to hate but can't.

It's the actors' fault: they're very, very good - TOO good for this unbelievable story. Unfortunately, the weakest actor is the one playing Jonathan, who brings no sensuality or charisma or other hot quality to the role to compensate for his nebbishy homeliness and explain WHY the two hunks are so irresistibly attracted to him.

He was much more believable in Postmortem, the short this movie is based on (available on the compilation DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boys-Briefs-3/dp/B000I8OMBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boys Briefs 3</a>). Opposite the same actor as Troy (but a much less gorgeous actor as Raul, in an almost negligible role), he was sexy, and the attraction between him and Troy in Postmortem was palpable and totally believable; it's not in this movie (but Postmortem was set in sexy, dynamic NYC, not in sterile, boring LA, which may have a lot to do with it).

Self-defeating compulsion is the only motivation either Jonathan or Troy shows in this movie, which may be intentional. August is a lot grittier and more complex (and therefore more interesting) than Postmortem was, which is why I'm giving it three stars despite the lackluster performance by Daniel Dugan in the key role as Jonathan. He was great playing the same character in Postmortem, but he'd lost the fire or something when August was made; since that character is central in the story, August suffers for it.",1349395200,10,2148,5.220289855072464
5130478,4,B0084BM7NK,"That is the films strapline and is quite a good synopsis of where this film is coming from. It stars Murray Bartlett (Farscape) as Troy. He has been off for a number of years working in Barcelona, but now he has returned to Los Angeles and discovers to his consternation that his ex boyfriend is seeing someone else. This is Jonathan (Daniel Dugan) and he is going out with a hunky Latino Raul (Adrian Gonzales).

Troy arranges to meet Jonathan for `a coffee' (that old chestnut) and it is clear from the get go that there are still strong feelings between them. Raul arrives and immediately puts his helmet on the table (he has come by scooter in case you thought it was getting smutty) and breaks up the coffee date before anything develops. Jon has helped Raul stay in the country by arranging a marriage of convenience and they clearly have affection for one another but have yet to commit to living together. As the summer temperatures rise, so does the obvious sexual tension and Raul decides to push things to an ultimate conclusion.

This is described as `a languorous, lyrical exploration of love split three ways'. Whilst I tend to agree it also hints at what some may find problematic and that is that `lyrical' often translates as slow, this film does take its time, but I didn't really think that was an issue. Much of the plot development is subtle in that we have meaningful looks and words left unspoken or hanging in the air. When `action' does come it acts to break the spell like a kind of release valve of emotions.

What this is also is a tale of missed opportunities and of taking loved ones for granted. Troy comes across as more than a little self centred and yet is at the same time vulnerable and likeable. There are some bedroom scenes but it is all pretty tame and works with the narrative rather than being put in for petty gratification. It is filmed using a number of techniques including the shaky hand cam that is starting to lose any novelty it once possessed, but the film does not suffer for it - it most certainly does not gain either.

This 100 minute film is from director Eldar Rapaport who has made two award winning shorts `Post Mortem' and `Steam' -both included as extras. They have been available before and are featured on `Boys on Film 4', and there is a `behind the scenes' too. One of the more thoughtful gay films to come out recently so if you like the raunchier end of the spectrum this may not be for you, I thought it was a well acted, directed and confident film and as such enjoyed the journey.",1348272000,,2550,4.47741935483871
5130479,4,B0084BM7NK,"After living in Spain for almost five years in his late 20's, Troy decides to return to Los Angeles.  One of the reasons is to reconnect with Jonathan, his ex-boyfriend who was deeply devoted to him, at a time Troy was likely too immature to handle a commitment like that. Jonathan is now in a relationship with the sexy Raul, who thinks it is nice that Jonathan can see his old friend, but that feeling changes when it seems that Jonathan is still attracted to Troy.

This is a beautiful, sexy film, capably acted by a great cast.  The only problems I have with it are technical:  some choppy film editing, background music that overtakes the dialogue, and a director who seems to be addicted to unnecessary extended solo scenes of a characters silently staring off into space. Overall, worth a look, and I give it four stars out of five.  Available on DVD and on some on-demand services.",1347926400,,889,4.566037735849057

5130481,5,B0084BM7NK,"When we dump the people who loved us and years later try to win them back even when we know they're already in healthy, steady relationships with other people, what does that say about us?

This sterling exemplar of gay cinema poses that very question : While being gay may not be about choice, whom we love and the lives we live certainly are. Once we've made those choices, how responsible are we in accepting the consequences or do we think we can have it all even if it means irreparably damaging the lives or relationsships of other people especially the ones we supposedly care about? Do we have that right?

Well acted and scripted, ""August"" is one gay-themed film you shouldn't miss.",1347148800,3,691,4.609756097560975
5130482,2,B0084BM7NK,"First of all stop making movies that promote that turning 30 in a gay man's life is the most defining and tumultuous moment...it is getting stale and a bit too convenient to wrap a story around this ""weak"" plot.

Second, the movie plays with the same old themes of ""what if"" and ""the one that got away""...many gay men have no problem with moving forward with their lives and allowing themselves to be happy and satisfied with the lives they have constructed. Troy seems to have a pull on Jonathan for no other reason than it is easy to be disconnected to life that he put forth after two years being separated. Always remember there is a reason why you broke up with someone and time does not erase that reality or make it any less apparent.

Lastly, the acting is alright...however, the constant exposing of flesh as if that is all which is required to sustain the movie...",1347062400,7,874,4.490566037735849
5130483,3,B0084BM7NK,"(( BACKGROUND FOR VIEWERS: This Feature Length film is a reworking of Director Eldar Rapaport's 2005, well received Short, ""Postmortem"" ))

""August""....whatever is meant by that, you might ask? Well, rather than looking at the title as being merely a play on words, let's just assume what's meant is the ""simmering""...""sweat-drenched""...""torridness""...of that particular time in the yearly weather cycle. In fact, this is what becomes visually and audibly obvious to us, as our actors/characters experience sometimes uncomfortably high temperatures---a condition reinforced by repeated soundtrack use of Los Angeles area weathercasts. So, indeed, this film does have ""Heat""! ....But, it's not just that sort of ""Hotness"" which involves us...because ""Lovemaking Action"" makes up a significant part of what's being shown in this film.

Still and all, IF a film director is going to expand an earlier released 16 minute Short into a 100 minute, Feature Length work....and essentially retain the same storyline and same 2 lead characters (tho now 6 years older)....there has GOT to be more provided than ""Heat""....more than ""Hotness"". Admittedly, a much lessor role in the short film's ""triangle of 3 guys"" has notably (and most SIZZLINGLY) been expanded in this 2011 production. For now we see the character of ""Raul"" being torridly played by relative newcomer, Adrian Gonzalez (giving us something not weather-related which definitely IS HOT). Oh, and we also have added a female role in the form of B(Girl)FF (and Green Card facilitator) ""Nina"", played by Hillary Banks.

Now, allow this Reviewer to give just a few closing thoughts involving the ""old and new"" productions, as coming from someone who's lived with the former for years...and with the latter for a couple of viewings:

- In the Short's early scene...involving former lovers meeting once again at an outdoor coffee house...there was an intimacy, a ""Heat"" between the 2, which burned off the screen and into the viewer. That is pretty much missing in today's re-tread scene and, for me, is due to one actor in particular.

- Adding several extraneous scenery and street-related shots may add minutes to a feature's length....but it does not necessarily add interest.

- I was sometimes left wondering which way writing and direction were heading with the sex shots. There is an anal sex scene, with virtually a full length, nude shot of the 2 going at it. Yet, at another point we're given an after-sex scene---our leads still together in bed---BUT wearing underwear (even tho the camera is, obviously, avoiding any ""crotch shots""). Are we advertising boxer briefs? Is this American network TV filming? Does our director expect this is ever to be shown as a K-Thru-12 (grade school thru high school) afternoon school special?

- What I would consider a production glitch involves occasional sound problems, with music and background conversations drowning out conversation between lead characters (this is even with earphone listening). There is no captioning provided...at least in my Region 2 DVD.

FINALLY -- Perhaps the best thing I can draw from this comparison of Short vs. Feature Length film, is that the feature definitely gives us a FINAL Ending...one which cannot be misconstrued or that is left up in the air. And even better than that....everyone gets what they deserve.

PS -- Writer/Director Rapaport strikes me as being particularly capable of developing intense and interesting storylines; he should stick to doing that...in all-new works. (I do acknowledge it is not easy for anyone to expand a short story into an acclaimed full-length novel...let alone achieve fully successful refilming.)

5130484,3,B0084BM7NK,"There are several good things to recommend this film. Wonderful Middle Eastern mood music and songs with great lyrics, great cast in the smaller roles, terrific lighting both on the inside and outside shots, and portrays LA pretty much as it is. The story moves slowly, which is a quality that I like about European movies. You get to savor the characters and mood of the film. The resolution of the film was a surprise, and I really liked how the character of Raul (Adrian Gonzalez)figured out how to deal with the problem created by the return of the ex lover Troy (Murray Bartlett), kind of a put up or shut up situation.

There were a couple of technical problems with the film that could have been much better. First, its really difficult editing a film to move around in time from the past to the present, back to the past etc...to express and idea of how the past is very much in the present and affects the future. Some films do this quite nicely. The viewer can switch gears when the next shot is in the past rather than the present and connect the dots well, and have the narrative make sense. This film does not do this well. Its confusing at times as to why, suddenly its in the past and what the point was.

Also, a technique that filmmakers use to express a mood, is having single shots of something that are put in the film as a way to express an emotion. There are way too many of these shots in the film and they don't really convey anything. Its as if somebody forgot to take the shot out. Reminds me of The Winchester House in San Jose where hallways and doors lead nowhere, or there's a wall on the other side of the door.

Now, as to the content, I wonder what the writer of this film had in mind. One thing's for sure, the theme really makes clear that a lasting relationship can't be based on sexual desire alone, or it will eventually crumble. Both Troy (Murray) and Johnathan (Daniel Dugan) appear as really unsympathetic characters. Throughout the film, Johnathan appears as if he is going to blow up in a rage, or suffer endlessly for something that he will regret and never have. Troy (Murray), looks as if he is looking for something that he will never have because he doesn't really have much to give. The sympathetic character is Raul (Adiran), who has the most to lose by possible deportation. He wisely does not throw a fit when Troy returns to LA, but waits it out to see what happens and comes up with an interesting solution to see whether Johnathan will choose him or Troy.

I can see, somewhere down the road ,where Raul will get his green card, realize that Johnathan does not have that much to offer and dump him for someone much better, or Johnathan will grow and develop with age and be someone that is worth Raul's affection. That would make an interesting movie in itself.

The film is however worth a watch and might even grow on a person with a second or third viewing.",1346025600,2,2915,4.400742115027829
5130485,3,B0084BM7NK,"High points are that it's well photographed, has a great musical score, and is a subtle, fairly realistic interpretation of modern day gay life. To that end, it's definitely better than most gay-themed movies.

Low points are that the story (though realistic) is pretty dull, even at 90 minutes, relying more on ambiance and style than on any real character development. The script seems to be the biggest problem here. Also, all three principle characters are wildly unlikable which I found quite off-putting.",1345593600,3,510,5.144578313253012
