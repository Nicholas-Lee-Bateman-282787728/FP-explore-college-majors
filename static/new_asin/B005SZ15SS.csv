8485642,5,B005SZ15SS,This movie reminds me of the Shelock Holmes movies in the 40's and 50's.  This was an excellent paradem humridge to Sir Conan Doyle.  The author/director stated through to the orignal author character.,1381104000,,201,5.0606060606060606

 Well, I'm not an english native speaker, so I'll try to stay understandable.
I'm, (I know it can be hard to understand ^^) a bootleg collector. I bought this one 'cause I'm a fan of the Detective Conan dramas.
So, on the cover, it says : ""Dramas 1 to 3"", so you expect to be in the box the DVD of the first, second, and third DVD of the dramas, right ? But no ! There are two DVDs : on the first, there are drama 1 and drama 2, and on the second, dramas 3 and 4 !
 The subtitles must have been done in, like, ten minutes. And the translators must have used google translate. I'm 100% serious.

Even if you're a masochist, don't buy this.

8485644,2,B005SZ15SS,"This live action set of movies is based off of the very popular anime/manga franchise Detective Conan (known in the English speaking world as Case Closed) by Gosho Aoyama. The series and movies follow Shinchi Kudou a high school detective with a keen eye for details who has been able to solve cases that have experts scratching their heads. From what I gather this set of movies was made to commemorate the 10th year anniversary of the show.

WELL pretty much as the title of the review says it's a nice looking boxset which features all 3 of the movies on 2 region free DVDs BUT the major problem is actually watching the movies. The movies are good in and of themselves BUT the subtitles are SO ridiculously bad that it renders the films eye gougingly annoying. It's seriously like someone was using Google Translate to do all the subtitles. I would say buy this if you are a pretty big fan like I am and just want to have something pretty to look at or are a stickler for having a physical copy BUT if you actually want to be able to watch the movies I suggest looking them up on Youtube and watching them for free with a decent dub.",1359849600,,1137,4.363207547169812
