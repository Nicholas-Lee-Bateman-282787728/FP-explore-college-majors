2499994,5,B000E6ESIK,I don't consider myself a hardcore fan and these have yet to be released. But i want Men-in-Tights so bad with a DVD quality picture I would pay $70 just for that one alone. Well just kidding but the good news is that the movies are being coded as DVD9 which is far easier to back-up and remove the long boring FBI warning screens and such for my own personnal copy. All these movies were done so long ago that no one should expect HD quality but alas once you see DVD you expect it. Just give me Dobly/DTS and widescreen with unseen footage and i'll be happy as can be.,1141257600,,570,4.1441441441441444
2499995,5,B000E6ESIK,"While I understand some ppl only wanting/needing a single title from the set being upset Im also sure they will make em available later as singles. I too own several of the titles in the set but started doing the Math. If I go the seperate route there are 3 I'd buy, at probably avg price of $20 each=$60 total. Since the entire set is selling for $70, at least in my case, by going with the set I'll get the 3 I really wanted plus some others I don't have and 2 duplicates (YF & Blazing)....don't forget the Dupes make great gifts hehe",1141084800,5,536,4.163461538461538
2499996,5,B000E6ESIK,"I normally hate those who post reviews of a DVD BEFORE it comes out, but I am forced to because what I hate more is poeple unable to see two feet or two weeks in front of them.  These will be released seperatly, they just havn't announced it to drive up sales of the boxset.  Don't diss these fine-looking dvds because you're either too cheap or too impatient to buy these.  Trust me, you'll get access to your movies, so stop waiting.  I had to wait a lot longer for Stephen King to finish the Dark Tower books than you will for seperate releases, so stop whining already and enjoy these great films.  Besides, there are some great unseen classics included here, the highlight being High Anxiety, which most people in the US havn't seen.  It is a HILARIOUS Hitchcock spoof, but you wouldn't find it if you limited yourself to Men in Tights or Blazing Saddles, which everyone has already seen.",1140739200,8,893,4.481481481481482
2499997,1,B000E6ESIK,I'm glad that Fox is finally putting Robin Hood: Men in Tights on DVD.  But they must be nuts thinking I'm gonna spend $70 for a whole set of movies if I only want the one.  That is just ridiculous!,1140566400,14,198,3.925
2499998,1,B000E6ESIK,How could Fox release this as a stand alone set only. They must release The Twelve Chairs as a separate entry. It is a minor masterpiece but to pay such a steep price for the set is something that I certainly will not do.,1140480000,11,221,4.045454545454546
2499999,1,B000E6ESIK,"The rating (similar to another review) is not low for the content but for the fact that Fox is so provincial that they haven't offered to release the titles separately. As mentioned in another review, most of us have the titles that have already been made available. Don't force us to buy copies of something we already own. Allow us to pick the titles we'd like to purchase or, at least, have a little common sense to offer a package of the titles that haven't already been released. Did someone at Fox let their 3-yr old put this together? C'mon.

Enough said....separate the titles. Think, man...think.",1140393600,8,605,4.7075471698113205
2500000,1,B000E6ESIK,"I've given this release a one star review not because of the films, all of which I love, but because it included several which have been available on DVD for many years and because there are no seperate releases listed for the new-to-DVD films.

I have no intention of buying this set. If and when the new-to-DVD films are released on their own, I'll be first in line to buy them.",1140134400,25,380,4.352112676056338

2500090,3,B000E6ESIK,"It's good to be the king.  These are decent transfers, but there is a weird zoom in some films which indicate a poor transfer quality.  You can ignore it in some cases, but there are many iconic shots in Young Frankenstein where characters faces are cut off.  I thought this might be an aspect ratio issue with my BluRay player or TV, but unfortunately it's not.  This is a great deal for fans of Brooks, but purists will be driven nuts.",1513728000,,437,4.3580246913580245

2500132,5,B000E6ESIK,Brooks has done so many funny films in so many styles. I loaned Young Frankenstein to a friend who had never seen it. Enjoyed watching old favorites. Some of his gag lines make us laugh before we are finished saying them.,1506556800,,221,4.414634146341464

On top of that, blazing saddles' part of the case that holds it is broken too. The discs are fine, but I need to get a new case. This is badly damaged.",1506470400,4,258,3.8867924528301887
2500135,5,B000E6ESIK,"Love Mel brooks?? Buy this!!!! All the favorites in one pack, and it's easy for travel.",1506124800,,87,4.5
2500136,5,B000E6ESIK,"Curiously I know many people who don't like Mel Brooks, or claim not to. Maybe they just don't want to admit it or haven't seen his films because they are often considered to be Basic humour. After all, the most famous scene in Blazing Saddles is the beans eating scene, nothing more than a carefully Coreographed fart joke.

Personally I think Mel Brooks is a comic genius and these films prove it. It's not a complete set. The most glaring omission is The Producers. Life Stinks and Dracula, Dead And Loving It are also absent. The 9 films that are included are all worth watching.

The 12 Chairs and To Be Or Not To Be are both remakes so not typical Mel Brooks fare but good nonetheless. I confess I have not seen the originals of either so can't say how they compare but these remakes work for me. The rest are classic Mel Brooks and take the Mickey out of various Hollywood genres, which may be why his output does not meet with universal approval. It certainly helps if you are acquainted with what is being satirized but it's not vital. You just might miss the odd joke here and there if you don't know the references. These films often work on 2 levels. You can take them at face value and just watch and laugh off you can look for something a little deeper and probably find it. Blazing Saddles for example has a strong message regarding how badly freed slaves were treated in the old west. Even the citizens of the town terrorized by the bad guys are depicted as racists.

These films are not as superficial as they first seem and can be watched over again to catch things you missed first time. Sometimes jokes are recycled but they are good jokes. Great stuff. Lots of extras too.",1505779200,,1693,4.419871794871795

Brooks has influenced a world of comedy including Monty Python. It's good to watch these films from the king.",1497225600,3,345,4.864406779661017

2500231,5,B000E6ESIK,"This incredible 8 movie collection of Mel Brooks best films (most of them anyway) is still available, I purchased it about 11 years ago and it has been in regular rotation in our viewing preferences ever since.  The only movie sadly left out was The Producers which I purchased separately, and thankfully the forgettable Spaceballs was also left off the list.  Life Stinks and Dracula Dead & Loving It both date from the Robin Hood Men In Tights era but neither can hold a candle to Robin Hood, one of his absolute best.  So with four mainstays missing, you still have the overwhelming major titles worthy of repeated viewings (get The Producers to augment this collection, it deserved to be included).  As others have noted, The 12 Chairs is one of his best and most underrated/underappreciated films, often forgotten by being overshadowed under Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles which followed it with blockbuster status.

Having purchased the initial DVD release of this collection before Bluray (my favorite format now) came into my house (2006 and just now getting around to reviewing), I need to emphasize the beauty of film transfer and the terrific sound engineering which did go into all of these discs, there are bonus features aplenty and films which had been early on not anamorphic herein are!  The picture clarity on my 50 inch flatscreen has no issues and I cannot applaud the sound enough, whether I use straight DTS or one of the enhancements on my AV Receiver.  I cannot speak to the Bluray release of this set but the bonus features on most of the films are standard which came with the individual DVD movie packages, some of them are awesome, some are normal fare, and a few (like Young Frankenstein featurettes) are Abby Normal.  The Blazing Saddles featurettes are unfortunately not the multitude found on the 2004 Anniversary issue.

I have read that The Producers (as well as Spaceballs) were left out due to legal constraints, which would have made this box set a Decalogue but of course one of the stone tablets was dropped so...  If you are looking for the very best of Mel Brooks filmography gathered together, purchase this box in either DVD or BR and pick up The Producers separately, it is really all you need for the finest comedy entertainment ever set to film.",1493164800,2,2299,4.812182741116751

The earliest one in this, ""The Twelve Chairs"" is one of my favorite films... if only for the great song, ""Hope for the best, expect the worst..."" And then there's Mel doing a lovely imitation of Frank Sinatra in another of the films... and the utterly crazy History of the World, Part 1. never was a part 2.

2500324,5,B000E6ESIK,"Mel Brooks is Mel Brooks.  That said, all of these movies are classics.  He is an equal opportunity offender.  He is irreverent, punches sacred cows (Alex Karras does in Blazing Saddles), and everyone is better off for laughing.  His very best movie, though, is his least known.  ""The Twelve Chairs"" tells the story of a former nobleman (Ron Moody) and a grifter (Frank Langella) looking for a set of dining room chairs in post Bolshevik Russia.  A priest (Dom De Luis...a very young and thin Dom De Luis) is relentlessly shadowing them.
The comedy isn't heavy handed, but deft, and subtle. It is one of his best movies, and as much of a treat as ""To Be or Not to Be.""  But it is in ""Blazing Saddles"" you see Mel Brooks unleashed.  He leaves no one alone.  Cleavon Little is cool, and a true sophisticate taking on the state of California and stereotypes. Mel Brooks is obnoxious, crude and wickedly funny.  He leaves (for that time) no ethnic slur unsaid in his pursuit of comedy for all.  The fact that he can't make this movie now is a witness to how far we have fallen away from the truth in comedy.  Don't get this if you are easily offended.  But if you want to belly laugh, you won't waste your money or time.",1486771200,7,1216,4.3991031390134525

The collection is inexpensive and makes a very nice gift. I received it as a gift. The entire set of eight is only about $24, which makes it $3 a film, less than some boxes of popcorn in many theaters and much cheaper than the movie in a theater. Besides being funny and great entertainment, good satire, like these, prompt viewers to think about the present, past, and future, and this is good.",1483833600,,526,4.489583333333333

2500718,5,B000E6ESIK,"Amazing Value!  To have so many classic Mel Brook's masterpieces of comedy on Blu-ray for under $40 is simply incredible.  I grew up with many of these movies breaking social taboos and creating timeless one liners from some of Hollywood's best actors & actresses.  Buying the following movies individually would cost considerably more, so snagging this collection is a great buy without a doubt:
Blazing Saddles (Harvey Korman and Madeline Kahn steal the show on this one)
Spaceballs (Even the hardest core Star Wars fans have to laugh at this spoof)
Young Frankenstein (Making Horror hysterically funny)
High Anxiety (The title says it all)
History Of The World Part 1 (wish they'd been able to continue it on to Part 2 - tons of big name stars in this one)
Robin Hood: Men In Tights (way ahead of its time in funny spoof of the R hood and his merry men)
Silent Movie (the younger generation don't get how funny this truly is)
To Be Or Not To Be and The Twelve Chairs (having friends over to rewatch 2 Be or Not and see 12 Chairs for the first time!)

I don't think you have to be a fan of every one of these movies to still find it a great value in getting all of them on Blu-Ray, give some to mom and dad, they will enjoy this type of 'regifting'.
OH! and be sure to watch the extras for each of the movie, in some cases funnier than the actual scenes in the movies.",1482364800,4,1370,4.33984375

2501672,5,B000E6ESIK,"Each one of these movies has been beautifully remastered for Blu-ray and none of them have ever looked this good. I am a huge fan of these movies, and I was very pleased, to say the least, with the picture quality of this set. I won't go into Young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles as they have been available on Blu-ray already. I did not have a chance yet to check out Blazing Saddles but since it has a Warner label on it I am going to assume that the release is the same as the Warner. Too bad, at least if Fox had done it, it would have had loss less instead of the Dolby Surround lossy of the Warner edition. The rest of the movies sparkle and it is evident that much work was done on these transfers, they actually exceeded my expectations. Beautiful visuals.

The sound is another story. Since many of these were released in the 70's, when sound seems to be at a poor point for films, each movie has very different audio. Silent Movie is in full stereo, which I am grateful for since I love the John Morris score, one of his best. The quality is good, not like today's tracks, mind you, but for sure a step up from the DVD in quality.

Unfortunately, High Anxiety and History of the World are basically still mono. Now I am a big advocate of providing the original soundtrack, but these 2 films would have been great in stereo, and since Fox provides the isolated music score from the music stems (yes you can hear John Morris Q'ing the music), would it have been that hard to remix the films for stereo, at least the scores, since they provided a DTS MA 5.1 track? The sound on these score tracks is stunning, and it saddened me that Fox didn't go one extra step and remix the movies that were mono for stereo (while proving the original mono alongside). What is provided here for the 5.1 DTS MA is a simulated stereo. It's better than the mono track in fidelity, but certainly not as good as stereo would have been. The Inquisition would have been great in full stereo, as would much of the music in High Anxiety. Most of the other films are true stereo and the later films have the better soundtracks. Still, all of these movies sound better than they ever did due in part to the lossless audio. I guess the lack of true separated stereo music on the earlier films was the only downer for me with this set, but it certainly by no means indicates any problem because these films (High Anxiety, Young Frankenstein and History of the World) were never presented in stereo to begin with.

There are extras on every disc, and while I have not yet viewed them all, they are good 15-25 minute interviews and the like. I do wish there were a few more extras, but we do get 5 isolated music scores, something I love about many of Fox's releases.

There is nothing that should stop any fan of good comedy and of course fans of Mel Brooks from buying this set, it's wonderful, and to get all of these films at one time rather than wait for individual releases (like we did on DVD) is fantastic! I love the beautiful book included with stills behind-the-scenes I have never seen. A great addition. One problem-the section that holds the discs themselves does not stay securely glued to the backing. It's no problem, nothing tears or anything but something a little more sturdy would have been nice for that section. Buy this-the hours of laughs are priceless as is the quality.",1455840000,,3375,4.3952

That was then this is now. This 9 disc collection is in a 9 disc blue blu-ray case with the plastic flippy pages like Walking Dead or or other beloved TV shows come in. If you like functional packaging you are going to love this.

This is a good collection. It includes History of the World pt 1, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety, To Be Or Not To Be and others.

2501780,2,B000E6ESIK,"although this seems to be a fairly thorough and much needed compilation of Brook's work, it is missing two of his bests. omitting The Producers with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder is simply unforgivable - for my taste his best work, and one of my all time favorite comedies. Life Stinks is also not in the set - with Mel in the leading role. I can't understand why these two films could be omitted.",1453161600,6,395,4.351351351351352

Andrews Blu-ray Reviews: Because there is far too much information on each individual Blu-ray Disc, if you want to find out more information about each individual Blu-ray Disc, then please go to the internet web sites relating to this The Mel Brooks Collection. But I hope what I have supplied, will be of some help to whether you will want to purchase this amazing Blu-ray Collection.

Mel Brooks: the madcap comic writer-director-actor extraordinaire and lovable lunatic has helmed a handful of truly entertaining farce comedies during his long career. Though the nine movies in this collection aren't all representative of Mel Brooks at his best, certainly his best films, apart from the original version of The Producers are here, and there are others which even at their worst contain moments of remarkable invention, astonishing nerve, and absolute hilarity.

The Twelve Chairs [1970] In the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution, erstwhile count Ippolit Vorobyaninov [Ron Moody] has been reduced to being a simple clerk. But, before his mother-in-law dies, she reveals to him and local priest Father Fyodor [Dom DeLuise] that the family jewels, thought lost, are hidden in one of 12 English chairs that once adorned their mansion in Moscow. Partnering with small-time hood Ostap Bender [Frank Langella], Ippolit races to find the loot before Father Fyodor, who wants it for himself.

Blazing Saddles [1974] In this satirical take on Westerns, crafty railroad worker Bart [Cleavon Little] becomes the first black sheriff of Rock Ridge, a frontier town about to be destroyed in order to make way for a new railroad. Initially, the people of Rock Ridge harbour a racial bias toward their new leader. However, they warm to him after realizing that Bart and his perpetually drunk gunfighter friend [Gene Wilder] are the only defence against a wave of thugs sent to rid the town of its population.

Young Frankenstein [1974] Respected medical lecturer Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) learns that he has inherited his infamous grandfather's estate in Transylvania. Arriving at the castle, Dr. Frankenstein soon begins to recreate his grandfather's experiments with the help of servants Igor [Marty Feldman], Inga [Teri Garr] and the fearsome Frau Bl&uuml;cher [Cloris Leachman]. After he creates his own monster [Peter Boyle], new complications ensue with the arrival of the doctor's fianc&eacute;e, Elizabeth [Madeline Kahn].

Silent Movie [1976] In this dialogue-free slapstick comedy, film director Mel Funn [Mel Brooks] travels to the ailing Big Picture Studios to pitch his comeback film: the first feature-length silent movie in many years. Desperate for a hit, the studio chief [Sid Caesar] gives Mel Funn and his cronies, Eggs [Marty Feldman] and Bell [Dom DeLuise], the go-ahead, but only if they can get big celebrities to act in it. Excited, Mel Funn begins an adventure across the country in his effort to secure superstars for his film.

High Anxiety [1977] Just after becoming the director of the Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous, Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke [Mel Brooks] is greeted by a series of mysterious events. When his colleagues, including the militaristic and mustachioed Nurse Diesel [Cloris Leachman] who becomes leery of his questions, they accuse him of murder. Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke's own mental health comes into question as he struggles to clear his name in the midst of a crippling bout of a condition known as ""high anxiety.""

History Of The World Part 1 [1981] Human history is traced through a series of vignettes, beginning with cavemen awestruck by their own magnificence. Then Moses [Mel Brooks] receives the tablets containing the ""15"" commandments, and Emperor Nero [Dom DeLuise] presides over a madcap Rome with his wife, Nympho [Madeline Kahn]. Jumping ahead, the Spanish Inquisition softens repression with song and dance, and a few centuries later Madame Defarge [Cloris Leachman] is fomenting revolution in France. Narrated by Orson Welles.

To Be Or Not To Be [1983] Frederick Bronski [Mel Brooks] and his adulterous wife, Anna [Anne Bancroft], are a pair of hammy actors running a low-rent theatre in Warsaw, Poland. When the Nazis invade, the Bronskis find their theatre becoming a makeshift refuge for local Jews and a gateway to the Polish underground. Using their limited acting skills, the members of the theatre troupe attempt to deceive the Nazis and lead an escape. Meanwhile, a Polish pilot [Tim Matheson] thinks he has found a spy in England. Narrated by Scott Beach.

Spaceballs [1987] In a distant galaxy, planet Spaceball has depleted its air supply, leaving its citizens reliant on a product called ""Perri-Air."" In desperation, Spaceball's leader President Skroob [Mel Brooks] orders the evil Dark Helmet [Rick Moranis] to kidnap Princess Vespa [Daphne Zuniga] of oxygen-rich Druidia and hold her hostage in exchange for air. But help arrives for the Princess in the form of renegade space pilot Lone Starr [Bill Pullman] and his half-man, half-dog partner, Barf [John Candy].

Robin Hood: Men In Tights [1993] Crusading nobleman Robin of Loxley [Cary Elwes] escapes from prison in Jerusalem and returns home to find that the evil Prince John [Richard Lewis] has confiscated his family estate and is abusing the citizenry.

Blazing Saddles Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Mel Brooks: This is somewhat rambling, occasionally going off subject in mentioning other films of his, and he only speaks for fifty minutes total. Still, its a more interesting commentary than others where he basically describes whats on screen. Here, its not screen specific at all and he merely recalls specific anecdotes in preproduction, casting, filming, the sneak preview, and its release and subsequent rerelease during the same calendar year.

Special Feature: Back in the Saddle [28:00] This a making-of feature with Mel Brooks, co-writer Andrew Bergman, producer Michael Hertzberg, and actors Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, and Burton Gilliam reminiscing about the films production. There are also clips from cut footage inserted into network broadcasts of the film.

Special Feature: Black Bart [24:30] This an unsold television series pilot using characters and motifs from the film. Starring Lou Gossett, Jr., the show is basically humourless, despite a cackling laugh track.

Special Feature: Intimate Portrait: Madeline Kahn [3:45] This a too-brief excerpt from a Lifetime biographical tribute to the late comic actress Madeline Kahn. The short scene deals specifically with her work on this film.

Deleted Scenes [10:00] There are Seven deleted scenes, all seeming to be cutting room footage which is usually substituted for the smuttier gags in the film during television broadcasts.

Theatrical Trailer [1974] [2:15] This is the original trailer for Blazing Saddles.

Special Feature: Making FrankenSense of Young Frankenstein [480i] [41:45] This documentary made for the first special edition DVD release of the movie.

Special Feature: Transylvanian Lullaby: The Music of John Morris [1080i] [10:30] This is a well-deserved tribute to the dazzling musical underscore by Brooks regular film composer John Morris. Both he and his wife comment on his career along with other creative staff from the films.

History of the World Part I Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Musical Mel: Inventing The Inquisition [1080p] [10:45] This is something of a misnomer since many of the songs Mel Brooks wrote for his films are discussed before the discussion turns to the song he and Ronny Graham (who appears in the number) wrote for this film.

Special Feature: Making History: Mel Brooks on Creating the World [1080p] [10:00] This is a segment on the making of the film with not only Mel Brooks discussing the making of the movie but also members of the cast and crew rendering opinions about the finished work.

Spaceballs Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Mel Brooks: This is a rather tedious slog actually. He loves and appreciates everyones contributions, and he far too often describes what were seeing on the screen. Occasional titbits of production information are also in the bonus featurettes making them not such major revelations here.

Special Feature: Spaceballs: The Documentary [480i] [30:00] This is a compendium of production anecdotes from the director, his co-writer Thomas Meehan, the cast, and members of the crew who all have nothing but positive things to say about their experience on this picture.

Special Feature: Watch the Movie at Ludicrous Speed [480i] [00:30] This is a throwaway feature speeding through the entire film.

Special Feature: Stills Galleries [480i] There are three stills galleries which the viewer may step through: a behind-the scenes set of colour photos, a selection of costume design sketches by designer Donfeld, and character portraits of the major characters from the film.

Theatrical Trailer [480i] [2:30] There are Two trailers may be selected for viewing. The international exhibitor teaser trailer with a Mel Brooks introduction and the theatrical trailer.

Special Feature: Six Continuity Flubs and Film Gaffes [480i] They remain in the film, but are available for selection. The menu does not possess a play all option, so one must tediously be returned to the main menu each time one is finished before another can be viewed.

Special Feature: Storyboard-To-Film Split-Screen Comparisons [480i] [6:45] There are several split-screen comparisons, which can be viewed. All of the storyboards concern the desert sequences of the film.

Robin Hood: Men in Tights Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Mel Brooks: This has been carried over from the original laserdisc release of the movie. Though hes guilty as usual of describing what were seeing on screen or setting up jokes before they happen, as if we cant see the set-ups for ourselves, Mel Brooks does occasionally add some nuggets of information about the production process.

Theatrical Trailers [1080p] This is a Gallery of Mel Brooks film trailers, which includes: High Anxiety; History of the World Part I; Silent Movie; To Be or Not To Be and Young Frankenstein. They may be watched individually.

Finally, if you're a Mel Brooks fan then The Mel Brooks Collection is manna from heaven, despite the significant absence of The Producers [2005] film, starring Nathan Lane, Mathew Broderick, Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell. Mel Brooks is one-of-a-kind approach to film comedy is outstandingly represented in this Nine film Blu-ray box set featuring films which run the gamut from great to mediocre. Though buying the box means a potential double dip with three of the previously released Blu-ray titles, hard-core fans will likely want all of these films and the attractive little booklet which accompanies the set. Very Highly Recommended!

2502236,5,B000E6ESIK,"In 2000, CBS aired the ""American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Laughs"" ranking the 100 funniest films of all time. Mel Brooks landed three films in the top 15:  ""Blazing Saddles"" (No. 6), ""The Producers"" (No. 11) and ""Young Frankenstein"" (No. 13). Unfortunately, this box set does not include Brooks' directorial debut ""The Producers."" However, despite that omission, you do get an additional seven comedies from 1970's ""The Twelve Chairs"" to 1993's ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights.""

When it comes to Mel Brooks' brand of comedy, there are two types of people:  Those who recognize Brooks as a comedic genius, and those who wouldn't know comedy if it pulled down their pants and hit them in the face with a meringue pie. Here's a Mel Brooks quote that I particularly enjoy that may help explain his thoughts on comedy:  ""I cut my finger. That's tragedy. A man walks into an open sewer and dies. That's comedy.""

You gotta admire a man who's gotten so many laughs off Hitler. Talk about chutzpah!

2502426,5,B000E6ESIK,"When I saw this collection for the price offered, I had to scoop it up. Mel Brooks' work is brilliant, with the exception of Space Balls (not the brightest candle on the Brooks cake). He demonstrates more than anyone I think, that you don't have to be vulgar in order to be funny. His humor is risqu without being demeaning, and he is an equal opportunity ""offender."" That last remark I intend in the best of ways. He pokes fun at the absurdity of bigotry whether it is based on color, religion, gender or sexual orientation. And he himself lamented in a recent interview, he would not be able to make some of his movies today, (like Blazing Saddles) because someone would label him as racist or politically incorrect. His humor highlights the ridiculous ways we treat one another in society without being cruel including his own Jewish heritage, which he seems to take particular delight in.",1410912000,2,892,4.687898089171974

2502438,5,B000E6ESIK,"I've been a HUGE. Mel Brooks fan for longer than I can remember (over 40 years). Gladly, one of my three children (all adults now). Love him too. I was thrilled to pick up this set at a very reasonable Amazon Gold Box Deal special price and will never go have any regrets. It's already one of nanny things my 27 year old son is looking forward to inheriting. If you love Mel, there's no need to sell thus to you. You know the movies. They're in BluRay so the video and sound are too notch and you don't have to wait until they're available on one of your commercial free premium TV channels to get a fix of Mel, Gene a Wilder, Madeline, Marty, Dom, or any of then other comic greats that had the wisdom and privilege of working with a comic director/producer/actor that will be alluded to with the same esteem as Groucho, Chico, Harpo, W.C.

Granted as they were not filmed in Hi-def there is some limitation with this Blu-ray collection oppose to films done in Hi-def from the start. Still the quality is very good and improved over the original, essentially an upgrade of existing film. If you have been looking for this collection of films this Blu-ray version is well worth the price along with some extras you will enjoy.

If you have not seen this film. Oh how funny it is, you will love it.
A lot of Brooks' humor is adolescent boy poo-poo humor, that I don't like, but I love the social commentary, and irreverent, audacious poke in the eye humor that goes along with it.
 I love Mel Brooks.

I  still have not watched The Twelve Chairs (believe it or not, I've NEVER seen it) and my breath is baited (a not altogether pleasant fragrance after consuming several night crawlers, so I watch these alone).

2502611,3,B000E6ESIK,"You get a bunch of Mel Brooks' movies here, but many aren't that great (in my opinion); the best are Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein.  I also liked Men in Tights.  Mel Brooks has a kind of weird sense of humor, and in some of his earlier movies (where he actually was the star), that humor kind of falls flat (at least for me).  It seems as he kept making them, the humor got better, and he pushed the envelope a little more.  If you haven't seen these movies, they are certainly worth the price for the laughs and humor, but be aware the quality of the earlier ones is not as good as the later ones.  He tends to have the same characters in most of his movies, so people like Marty Fredman (sp?), Don L., and others in in most of them (Gene Wilder was a late comer to some of his best).",1407801600,,794,4.096774193548387

2502642,5,B000E6ESIK,"There have already been 726 other reviews so it would be hard for me to write anything that has not already been written. I do agree with the 563 other reviews that gave this collection 5 stars. I paid $21.99 for the collection plus $1.54 in tax for 9 movies and about 15 hours or so of fun. I am a ""senior"" individual so I saw most, if not all, of these talented stars when they were in their prime. In actuality, seeing the performance of Anne Bancroft again is alone worthy of 5 stars. There are also some moments of reflection when watching those no longer with us whose talents we so much enjoyed.

This is a collection worth getting. I cannot in all honesty say that I personally enjoyed every one of these movies to the fullest. But I can say in all honesty that I got well over 5 stars worth of total enjoyment from at least five of them. The other four were OK in my book but may easily be more than OK in yours. One thing is certain and that is that this is a five star collection. There is no way that 564 of us, to date, can be wrong.",1406764800,,1046,4.053140096618358

Got this as a lighting deal, so amazing price, but worth it full price if you like Mel Brooks!",1406160000,,337,4.075757575757576

2502677,5,B000E6ESIK,"Bought this as a present for a friend who loves Mel Brooks movies. He was pretty stoked- and forced me to sit through a few. Funny, clever, occasionally over-the-top, and often crass, I did laugh a few times even though the humor doesn't always appeal to me. I was pleased to see the picture quality was good, and both of us were interested in the extras. So an A+ choice for the Mel Brooks lovers in your life. I'm keeping this on file as a future gift option.",1406073600,,461,4.25

2502752,3,B000E6ESIK,"Mel Brooks movies all follow a similar formula. The gag lines, the sexual humor, the variety of funny, or somewhat funny, characters are here. Some movies are quite funny. Others are distastefully irreverent, and not all that funny. I tossed The History Of The World in the trash. Just be aware that Mel Brooks isn't family fare. If you're not a fan, be careful. His humor isn't for everyone, nor is it funny to everyone. Bottom line: I like some of his movies, and dislike some. If you consistently like Mel Brooks, you'll like this collection.",1398470400,,545,4.6875
2502753,5,B000E6ESIK,Love his movies. Had to have this. Glad to see all of them in one collection. The extras were fun.,1398384000,,98,3.95

2502780,5,B000E6ESIK,I wanted to purchase 2 additional Mel Brooks movies in Blu-Ray. But decided to purchase the complete set for just $10 over the cost of 2 movies.

2502781,3,B000E6ESIK,"The Mel Brooks Collection has just been sitting on my shelf for like three months.
Also, when i bought it, the hinges on the inside that hold the discs were flimsy and broke.

Last time I remember, I wasn't a big fan of Spaceballs. Is it good? Or too spoofy?",1396915200,,258,4.16
2502782,5,B000E6ESIK,Each of these movies has some great work from Brooks. From straight up comedy to the parodies he has been known for doing. If you are a Mel Brooks fan and can find this as a Lighting Deal as I did then pick it up and give it a watch.,1396828800,,233,3.68
2502783,5,B000E6ESIK,"The word ""Hilarious"" is given too freely to what is considered comedy currently.  Mr. Brooks is one of a kind and timeless.  His work is hilarious.",1396828800,,147,4.615384615384615

2502807,5,B000E6ESIK,"Lol!! What can I say? It's Mel Brooks! I love this collection because I saw ""The 12 Chairs"" way back at the theater release in a double-feature with ""High Anxiety"" and had not been able to find it anywhere! So fun to watch this collection and to see more of Mel's work I'd not seen before--what a blast! Thanks!",1394409600,,311,4.288135593220339

2502810,5,B000E6ESIK,"From the simply silly to the sublimely ridiculous, Mel Brooks writes comedy at its finest. He proves that being completely ""politically incorrect"" is superb. Every film is pure entertainment.",1394236800,,191,5.620689655172414

2502815,5,B000E6ESIK,"It has all the good hits I have come to love from Mel Brooks and it even includes Spaceballs (which was inexplicably omitted from one of his other boxed sets).  It comes in a single case with ""pages"" of discs to flip.  The case is sturdy plastic though, not cheap cardboard sleeves.  The President Scroob face looks lovely on my shelf.  While Mel's movies were certainly not filmed in high def, this is a viable up-convert.  Good quality, not grainy or trashy like some other hasty re-releases on blu-ray.

This is simply a must have for Mel Brooks fans.  And you really can't beat the price.",1393286400,,592,4.528301886792453

2502848,4,B000E6ESIK,"It's great bang for the buck, but you get what you pay for.  The transfers are passable but there's very little visual upgrade over my up-scaled Mel Brooks DVDs.  Part of this is a fact of life because there was a lot of film grain when the movies were made.  Still, against other films of similar eras, this just isn't a terribly high quality transfer.  If you want to see amazing transfers from that era check out Taxi Driver or Lawrence of Arabia.

That said, outside of Spaceballs the visuals aren't the appeal of a Brooks' film so definitely worth picking up if you don't already own these films.",1392940800,,601,4.477064220183486
2502849,5,B000E6ESIK,I have always loved these films.  They have feature bonuses on some of the movies.  There are deleted scenes and much more funny schtuff!!  You'll love it...or you'll hate it....no...Love it!  Ha Ha!,1392681600,,199,4.9393939393939394

2503032,4,B000E6ESIK,"Well, i knew I was going to like this collection when I got it.
With the exception of Robin Hood Men in Tights, all of the movies are excellent or good.
Now, being a Mel Head, I had all of his movies on DVD - over the summer, I was sick and my kids went to the local liberry and took out this collection for me to watch - I was amazed at the difference in quality between the previously issued DVDs - there was no comparison.  The colors were simply amazing on the blu-ray and the transfers of the film were some of the best that I have seen.  even the 12 Charis on old Film Stock looked great.
The only downside to the set was the omission of The Producers and Dracula Dead and Loving it - THAT IS THE REASON FOR FOUR STARS NOT FIVE.
But I wasn't going to run out and buy it - until Amazon dropped the price - damn you, Amazon.",1387324800,,828,3.9226190476190474

2503062,5,B000E6ESIK,"Can't go wrong with this almost complete collection of Mel Brooks movies(left out The Russians are Coming,Dracula,and The Meaning of Life),but perhaps that's for a later release.
Also the additional benefits are the bonus commentary features included in this collection.
I think of it like this. Who wouldn't wanna go to film school and not have to pay tuition?
You get to hear the master of comedy share his movie thoughts with you in the comfort of your own home anytime you invite your guest in.",1387152000,,498,4.8023255813953485

If you go through them in chronological order, you'll actually see that he gets better, funnier, and more off the wall as he progresses, which means you'll enjoy them more and more.

So very funny this set and so wonderful to have received it through Amazon.  Didn't even know it existed.  Have always dealt with Amazon and always will.

2503122,5,B000E6ESIK,What a collection! Get this on sale and you really have a fabulous deal here. I can't recommend this enough. The review really doesn't need to be much longer. If you are a fan of Mel Brooks then get this immediately. The case is nice and compact and the discs all fit in it well. I really like when studios give this kind of value as we have bought these plenty over the years. The transfers are all good to great though Blazing Saddles sadly still has a Dolby track and weakish transfer. A couple of them are a little smooth at times but more than likely olny the bare minimum was spent to restore them. I am sure they will reissue BS at some point and I will double dip when they do. The rest look good to great and feature fairly high bitrates.,1386460800,,747,4.158620689655172

2503138,4,B000E6ESIK,"A great collection for the price. No real big extras and each movie is on it's own separate disc (unlike some of these $10 collections that use both sides of a disc). It had two movies that I did not own yet so that was a plus for me. Keep in mind that just because it is blu-ray that you get a better image as the image can only be as good as it's original material. As noted in other reviews these are mostly the original theatrical versions and not any special edition. It is however disappointing that The Producers was not included. That would have made this collection a must have. I have always considered ""Blazing Saddles"" as the best comedy of all time followed by History of the World Part 1. Too bad a part 2 was never made.
The only thing I would complain about is the slightly odd blu-ray case in which the disc carriers shift about enough to not allow the case to close properly. Push it back in place and then you can snap the case shut.",1386288000,,952,4.2076502732240435

2503147,5,B000E6ESIK,"This set is great. Great quality discs.

This set is fantastic. It doesn't have all of his movies but it has a very nice selection. Some of these movies are definitely under-appreciated and I hope this box set gets a few more people to see them. My top pick in that category is twelve chairs.

One of the really cool things about this set is that it is rich in extra features. I love this set and I hope you do too.

2503180,3,B000E6ESIK,"Purchased at a great price, I like this set, but I have found two issues that give me pause about wholeheartedly recommending it to others.

 First, some of the Blu-ray disks in my collection played, but were VERY noisy in my Sony Blu-ray player.  It's a new player and it has played other discs without this noise, so I have to assume it's the disc and not the player. It was extremely distracting while watching the movie.  Second, the quality of the picture wasn't as good as expected (Robin Hood Men In Tights) and the sound level fluctuation made it frustrating to watch. I didn't notice this with all the films.

I mention these things only for info.  Admittedly when you take an older film and put it into Blu-ray format, you're working with the original, which may have these issues already.  Just wanted to share a bit of information for you to decide if this collection is right for you.

Again, I didn't notice these issues with all the discs and the collection's contents overall are just what you'd expect - lots of fun!",1385078400,9,1033,4.545945945945946
2503181,1,B000E6ESIK,"The packaging for the DVD's causes the discs to snap in half when you attempt to remove them from the cases.  Extremely disappointing, I just purchased a collection where now two of the discs have snapped in half before we ever got to watch them.",1384905600,8,246,4.466666666666667
2503182,5,B000E6ESIK,"A truly unbelievable price for so many fabulously funny Mel Brooks movies.  Even though I already owned three of them on DVD, it was more than a worthwhile purchase!  Especially thrilled to finally add a couple of faves to my library, History Of The World Pt. 1 and the lesser-known gem,  High Anxiety.  If you're a Mel Brooks fan, don't ""Count the Money""...buy it now!",1384646400,,369,4.630769230769231
2503183,4,B000E6ESIK,"Great set, lots of great classic movies.  One HUGE hole is the lack of the film The Producers.  One of Mel Brooks' best films really should have been included.  Otherwise it's great, just wish I didn't have to order The Producers serperately.",1384646400,,242,4.714285714285714

2503212,5,B000E6ESIK,"I am already a fan of Mel Brooks, but I am biased that way, and I think that this is a great set and has some movies I had yet to see. Below is a list of the movies with a letter ranking and brief thoughts.

Blazing Saddles  A +

This is one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen! You will never see another movie liek this made today. The ending is especially hilarious

Young Frankenstein  A +

Very funny and in some instances, a melodramatic movie. Some of my friends don't think its funny enough, but the difference is that the comedy is more subtle than broad. It works as both a homage and a parody. One of my favorites!

Silent Movie  A

I love this movie! I have always been a big fan of silent movies and this is one of the best. Much better than the Artist which was overrated in my opinion. Great cameos by many stars of the day, and the most hilarious of which was Marcel Marceau.

Robin Hood: Men in Tights  C

I used to love this movie as a kid, and but after watching this for the first time after a while, I didn't like it as much. It is still a dent movie and I love the story of Robin Hood, however the pacing is different from what I remember and I thought it was very uneven. At any rate, I really enjoyed it still, but it was not what I remembered.

To Be or Not to Be  B+

Quite possibly the most underrated of Mel Brooks' films. While the original movie that this movie is remade from is better, this is very faithful to it and even adds some Brooksian elements, some of which work and others that don't. Its a bit uneven but it quite possibly ranks as one of my favorites.

History of the World, Part 1  B-

Very uneven film, but its a sketch film so thats to be expected. There are several great sketches, particularly during the first 40 minutes, after that it gets a little dicey. My favorite sketches were in the beginning, middle and end, including the Caveman material as well as the Spanish Inquisition song.

The Twelve Chairs  D-

Not a very good movie, but well worth a look if you are a Brooks completist. I was able to sit through the whole thing, but I found it dull, with exception of Brooks' performance. The worst movie of the bunch.

High Anxiety  C

Not the best of Brooks' films, but its a lot of fun and very funny. Alfred Hitchcock himself wrote this film with Brooks, and its an effective parody/homage like Young Frankenstein. It could have benefitted from a better plot and more interesting gags.

Overall, this set is great! I enjoy these films and it was a good buy at under 50 dollars!",1383350400,3,2541,4.200413223140496

2503214,5,B000E6ESIK,"I bought this when it was deeply discounted, I believe i paid about 20 bucks... but i gladly would have paid much more. The lack of space balls is sad, but other than that, it's a fantastic collection and it gets watched often. There's really not a bad movie in the bunch, and I hadn't seen a few of them (like to be or not to be) and I'm so glad I got the opportunity.

3. Spaceballs  4. History of the World (Pt. 1)

When I saw the set was repackaged into a smaller set, I waited for it to go back on sale and grabbed it up. The new size is just right for displaying/storing in your video cabinet.

They still hold up on disc completely unedited.  This is now the best way to see the master cinematic humorist of the 20th century in all his glory.  Mel Brooks left NYC so the elite film critics moved on to Woody Allen.  Allen was/is giggle and smirk humorous, when Brooks slap you leg, fall on the floor hilarious.

Mel Brooks is funny and must be seen without the man telling you what you are allowed laugh at.",1373241600,,560,4.295238095238095

I would have rather had ""The Producers"" and ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" instead of ""The Twelve Chairs"" (zzz) and ""To Be or Not to Be"" but hey, I wasn't asked.  Guess that's where it would be good to be the king... ;)

Mel Brooks is still the master of comedy and I can't hear the tune ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" without seeing the ""Monster"" trying to dance on Broadway. Of course, ""History of the World"" is side-splitting, and ""Blazing Saddles"" is now a classic, one to be watched over and over just for the humor.

2503650,5,B000E6ESIK,"It's amazing that many of these films remain in such good condition that they could not only be transferred to a digital High Definition format, but restored to look like they were shot yesterday. I grew up laughing with Mel Brooks and owned most of these movies on VHS. I hesitated buying the original DVD collection on account of the price and reviews suggested the dvd transfers were lifted from the VHS, rather than the original source. I thought I'd collect the movies individually, but never got around to it.

I was quite surprised to find the Blu-ray collection at a price below even the old DVD collection would ever have reached. Not only that, it had been re-released in a new plastic case that fits on your shelf with the rest of your collection, and it includes Spaceballs, one movie previously left out of the collection. When I saw the price (gold box special), I immediately purchased, though Amazon's regular price is such a steal on its own. I have to say I am very impressed and very happy to have these classic movies in the best yet available picture and sound quality. So, for the few reviewers that have gripes with these, let me explain:

These movies are now at least 20 years old. Most of them excede 30 years. So if you're expecting the tonal range of color and the rich warm 3-dimensional sound that you get with modern films, you're going to be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're expecting a flat, faded picture and muffled mono sound, you're in for a treat. The images in all of these films have been restored, bringing back rich blacks, vibrant colors, and reduced grain so that they look as if they had been shot yesterday. The sound varies, with more richer effects making their way in as the movies get newer and newer. The DTS-Master Audio is technically 5.1 channels, but expect your center channel to do most of the work. Still, the sound is as clear as they could get it from the master tracks with some surround effects whenever possible.

I waited for the anniversary/special editions to buy Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs on DVD. The BluRays come from these same transfers, but the picture is sharper and the sound is better (Be ware, Blazing Saddles is the only movie to not include a DTS-MA soundtrack, but this is the case on the individual blu-ray as well). The special features are the same, so I don't feel bad about replacing these DVD's.

The one gripe most reviewers have is the incompleteness of this collection. There are three more movies that Mel wrote, produced, and directed: The Producers, Life Stinks, and Dracula: Dead and Loving It. Why are they not in this collection? I cant' say for sure, but it's probably a combination of licensing rights and lack of Blu-ray availability. I'm guessing that sales of The Producers are high enough that MGM didn't want to risk losing profits to this value collection. Whatever the cause, just be happy that you can get the nine movies that you can at the incredibly low price offered. You cannot go wrong with this deal.

By the way, the 1.33:1 aspect ratio on Amazon's description is a mis-print. All of the movies are shown in wide-screen formats.",1370736000,5,3154,4.655296229802514

2503652,4,B000E6ESIK,"This is not Mel Brooks' complete filmography.  Most glaringly, it's missing The Producers.  In addition to writing and directing The Producers he had an uncredited role as a singer in Springtime for Hitler.

2503655,5,B000E6ESIK,I bot this collection several months ago now for this price. The deal was too good to turn down. I have watched some of these more times than I have fingers and toes. I had to go buy a Blu-Ray player after I bot these. Maybe it wasn't such a great deal. But these movies are some of the funniest stuff around. I have yet to become jaded.

A little birdie tells me that TODAY is a great day to order this to avoid high anxiety. To be or not to be? Just invite everyone over,
pull up twelve chairs and get off your blazing saddles. As you can tell from my profile photo, I'm NO young Frankenstein anymore. In
the history of the world, part two includes Spaceballs. There WAS a silent movie of Robin Hood that had men in tights, in part one.

2503815,4,B000E6ESIK,"Mel Brooks films are a timeless machinery of laughs. They have a bit of ingenuity, naughtiness and cleverness that are now, almost, completely lost.
We can see some of it in some TV shows, but no at all in cinema releases. The shadow casted by spoof comedies through the 70's until the early 90's are now very diluted. The scary movies and whatnot, don't even compare the greatness of this classics.
This collection is the most iconic compilation of the Mr. Brooks works, i has classics such as Blazing saddles and is all packed in a very neat book like case. It has restored video, that looks amazing, and restored music that sounds astounding. The extra material is nothing of extraordinary, but is very compelling. A few interviews with Mel Brooks himself, some of the producers and also some the stars of the productions.
It also has some trivia commentaries that show up as pop up cards if the subtitle options is selected.

2504029,5,B000E6ESIK,If you're looking at this collection then you know Mel Brooks so you don't need to know about the movies themselves.  The packagin is very nice and compact for NINE movies which I love and the price can't be beat,1355184000,,212,4.3
2504030,5,B000E6ESIK,"With a smile on your lips and a song in your heart, who I ask, who would turn their nose up at this collection of finely crafted works from one of the foremost brains on the planet ""Abby Normel""!
Delightful drafts of Devine decadance driving deadpan delivery! (Say that three times fast) Seriously I can always count on Mel Brooks to make me roll in the isles fracturing my funny bone. Every Disc a jem shining brightly for all to see. If Hitchcock were alive today he would most assuredly roast him slowly over an open pit for roasting his most memorable movie moments. And what Bronski did to Shakespeare Brooks did to ""To be or not To be""! Almost reproducing the origanal Jack Benny classic word for word, he throw in a few of his own with musical numbers that will stand the test of time.

Now go buy it for yourself!",1355184000,,821,4.366013071895424

2504104,3,B000E6ESIK,but it was pretty disappointing to have two of the disks so far with issues when trying to load them in the player.  I shouldn't have to eject and reload History of the World  and Robin Hood a time or two so they'll play.  I don't really see much difference is the Blu-ray version vs what I had of two of the movies on DVD.  I'll be more careful next time,1355097600,,355,3.9577464788732395

2504134,5,B000E6ESIK,"A few years ago, I got my wife the DVD set that strategically omitted ""Spaceballs.""  With the inclusion of that movie on the Blu-ray set, this is fully recommended.

Each movie (yes, they are all separate) has it's own spot in a several-page plastic case. Each disc also has it's own picture of the movie (not just silver discs with the names). I've only been able to watch two films from it so far, but I have to say if you are thinking about getting it, do it!",1354406400,,460,3.956989247311828

The films are Blue-Ray, and each is as funny as the very first time I ever saw them. It's not a complete collection, but that's easily rectified by buying any desired titles that were not included in this set. And, at this price .... it's even more laughable!!!",1353974400,,408,4.680555555555555

Some people complain that most of these weren't originally widescreen.  OK.  But I don't watch Mel Brooks for the perfect film quality.  They look much better than when I saw them on a 20 inch tube TV with commercials.  In fact, they look really good considering how old they are.  If you haven't seen his movies, you are missing a treat.  Brooks is an original.  I've been watching these with my 13 year old and getting a new generation hooked on Mel Brooks.  They are a little racy for kids, but whatever.  I still remember watching Blazing Saddles in the movie theater with my dad.  He used to quote that movie from time to time years later.  If my dad was still alive, I would send him this collection!",1352592000,,840,4.314102564102564

I heard a lot of rattling inside, so I opened it up and the plastic case that holds all the blu-rays was cracked and broken.  The cardboard box looked perfect, so I have no clue how it could of broken off pieces of plastic in 3 separate areas and long crack along the back cover.  Better to find out now than when someone opens it up as a gift and discovering it all cracked and broken.

Amazon of course is great and promptly shipping a replacement.",1352419200,,630,4.139344262295082

2504242,5,B000E6ESIK,"My title says it all. This is Mel Brooks in the Movies. What could be zanier, sillier, more fun? The quality of his films is necessarily uneven, but where else can you buy more fun for the money?",1350864000,,195,4.157894736842105
2504243,5,B000E6ESIK,What else can you say.  You love him or you don't.  It will be interesting to hear what they say about these movies in 50 years.  It's hard for movies to be politically correct and funny and Mel just didn't seem to care.  I'll bet that Sacha Baron Cohen has this in his collection.,1349740800,,281,4.148148148148148
2504244,5,B000E6ESIK,"How did they do this? By that I mean I've had the DVD collection on my wish list for years, meaning to buy it some day.
Then I was fortunate to have the Blu-ray collection offered as a one-day gold box deal (I hadn't even heard there was a blu-ray version in the making). I couldn't resist that deal, but at the same time, figuring there was 'something wrong with this picture'.
For the price, I took my chances.
Incredibly not only are the movies I've seen (half of them so far) in crystal clear HD and surround sound (5.1 and other, I believe) - - but SO ARE THE EXTRAS!
A Harvey Korman interview in Hi-def? When were these done?
My only complaint is it doesn't contain 'Dracula-Dead and Loving It'; one of my favorites of his along with Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. I would have given it 4.5 stars if possible due to that omission
I had never seen 12 Chairs and was glad I did when I watched it in blu-ray. The look of the film in blu-ray reminded me of sitting in a movie theatre back in the late 60's & early 70's before the mega-plexes started showing smaller screened, poorly focused movies.
At MSRP this seems to be a good deal. At the gold-box price it's a steal.",1348876800,,1183,4.285714285714286
2504245,5,B000E6ESIK,Great mini collection of Mel Brooks film for those upgrading to blu-ray!

2504247,5,B000E6ESIK,If you are a fan of mel brooks then this is for you. For me the big plus was they were all in blu-ray so the picture quality was better and the black and white movies looked good. Never heard of the twelve chairs till I watched this collection so all in all it is worth having in your collection of movies.,1348099200,,306,3.9516129032258065

2504290,4,B000E6ESIK,"This is a great collection of many of Mel brooks best movies. I was not familiar with ""Silent Movie"" of ""12 Chairs"" before I purchased this set but found the inclusion of them to be a nice rounding out of Mel's style. None of the movies include much by the way of special features if you look for that type of things. The packaging is nothing special but doesn't get in the way of a good product and doesn't feel like it will fall apart after a year or two either. I wouldn't pay full retail but would buy this again for the right price.",1347840000,,537,4.123809523809523
2504291,4,B000E6ESIK,"First off, it appears Amazon clumps all the various formats (VHS, DVD, Bluray) and different collections/selections of available movies included in these sets into this one review section. I am reviewing the 9 CD Blu-ray Collection.

Anyway, for less than $30.00, this is an excellent array of Mel Brooks movies. Since I never owned any of these movies on original DVDs, I am very pleased with this blu-ray selection of movies included. Okay, it's missing a couple of good movies...The Producers in particular, which I understand is due to licensing rights. Still, at about $3.22 a movie, I am happy.

The resolution is at least as good as the original movie(s) or, in most cases, better. The real improvement is in the sound quality when played on a home theater system. We all enjoyed watching these movies again!

Overall, not perfect considering today's standards but, a very nice collection of enhanced Mel Brooks movies. I recommend you laughing again (and again) watching these movies.",1347494400,2,992,5.036585365853658

2504293,5,B000E6ESIK,This contains a wonderful cross section of Mel Brooks that allows the viewer to see the evolution of the genius of satire and how he helps us to see what is truly important by never taking ourselves too seriously.,1347235200,,213,4.487179487179487
2504294,3,B000E6ESIK,"I like Mel Brooks - especially his more well known classics like Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Spaceballs.  But the others titles were a bit more obscure and for good reason - they are definitely not main-stream.  The collection was a good way, though, to see other movies that I wouldn't have checked out any other way.  If you like Mel B, you'll probably like the collection.",1347148800,,387,4.746268656716418

2504296,4,B000E6ESIK,"I was much younger when I thoroughly enjoyed movies as Blazing Saddles. As with the original Archie Bunker episodes, the shock element of the scatological & sexually and racially offensive language used is now quite offensive to me, and I'm a bit ashamed that I once roared with laughter. Such language has been over-used and has become fully uncouth rather than funny. Maybe I'm a victim of maturity? But I still gave the collection four stars as I realize back to the original time/venue - it was meant to be absurd in the extreme.",1346976000,,533,4.680851063829787
2504297,5,B000E6ESIK,"Most everything has been covered in other reviews, but I wanted to add one thing. Some of the earlier comments mention paper sleeves that each disc slides into. My version that I just received has the more familiar set of plastic pages with center hubs to click into the middle of each disc. This is a good thing and something they obviously changed after complaints about the earlier packaging. May the schwartz be with you.",1346889600,,425,4.68

2504330,4,B000E6ESIK,"This is a great collection of some of his more famous movies.  It does not include everything that I would have liked to see in a blu-ray collection of his works.  Also, the conversions to blu-ray are not the greatest as some of the older prints of the films were used for the conversions. It should be a set of his defining works in an as close to immaculate presentation as possible.

All that said...the comedy of these films still hold up well and this set is a great place to start for a newcomer to Mel Brooks.",1345766400,,516,4.244897959183674

History of the World Part 1, as with Blazing Saddles and many others, you will have to watch dozen of times just to catch all the jokes, pranks and facial expressions.

I feel that of the entire collection, ""Blazing Saddles"" is the best. While it may seem to be nothing more than one joke after another, if you think beyond the jokes & into them, they say, ""Don't be too serious about life"".",1345766400,,352,4.268656716417911

2504336,4,B000E6ESIK,This is a very comprehensive collection of Mel Brooks greatest movies. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is missing The Producers.

2504339,4,B000E6ESIK,Great selection of Mel Brooks movies. Shipped and received promptly. I could go into greater detail about the 'quality' of the picture from the disc(s) and so on but that's already been copiously covered. Bottom line is -- all the movies look and sound great (they're blu-ray!) and the included extra's are very entertaining. For the price I got this box set I am very happy with it.,1345507200,,383,4.647058823529412
2504380,4,B000E6ESIK,I got these for a song from Amazon. While the transfer is not that great they are still great fun. For the price I can not complain. The presentation is nice and the included booklet explains each movie.,1345420800,,203,4.368421052631579
2504381,5,B000E6ESIK,"I was originally looking to only replace one DVD movie.  However when I went looking on Amazon I saw that the collection was on a Timed Deal on Amazon.  It had an extreme price cut and I could not pass it up.  However even at the higher price it appears to be a value balancing both the content and price per disk in the set.  I believe it to be worth the investment so as one would say the buy is not just a ""Roll in the Hay"" (pardon the Pun).

Here is the low down on the collection:

1) The Box and Packaging of the disks is very good.  Includes a cover box and a plastic multi-disk case.  (The disks did not shift out of their spot in shipping)  Disks also go in and out of the case easily.  The Silk Screening on the Box Art is well done.  Great selection of Cover Art which is a picture of Mel Brooks as a ""Director"".
2) You receive quite a number of movies for the price.  Silk Screening on the disks is clean and crisp.
3) The picture quality is better than DVD, but maybe not as good as I have seen with other box sets.  But not to worry they do make good use of the extra room on the Blu-Ray with Extras.
4) I was impressed with the number of extras that were included, an Example of this is: In Young Frankenstein you get additional out-takes, interviews, bloopers, deleted Scenes, etc.
5) I would recommend exploring the extras - they are fun to watch and also give you some insight into the creative process and at times a bigger picture of the story.  (I.E. in Young Frankenstein you get to view, as part of the deleted scenes, the reading of the Baron's Will)
6) Includes Trivia Tracks which are fun to play.
7) Downside is it does not contain all of his movies.  It would be Nice to have a Volume 2 or 3 which would eventually bring all the features together under one consistently produced collection.
8) Makes a great gift!

I would recommend the collection. So start trading in your DVDs.

I have probably 3 or 4 of these movies already on DVD and when I saw this deal I didn't hesitate because its Mel""freakin""Brooks. I am not disappointed and have only watched Space Balls so far. If you love Mel's movies(and what Baby Boomer doesn't remember laughing their butts off when you first saw these)then buy yourself or someone else these classics. Remember laughter is the best medicine.",1344556800,,454,4.617283950617284
2504383,5,B000E6ESIK,"This is a great deal for a great price. It is missing a few of what I would say are excellent Mel Brooks films (The Producers comes to mind), but that's not enough to subtract a star.",1344211200,,183,3.972972972972973
2504384,4,B000E6ESIK,"This is a quick review of the new packaging for this blu-ray collection (since we all know most of these films already and this is the first time they're available together, so for fans/collectors it's pretty much a no-brainer anyway). Personally, after reading some reviews I knew I wanted this but was concerned whether this set would fit into my existing DVD shelf (call it OCD or whatev, but I didn't want to need a special place to store this thing...). Well the rest of the space-conscious collectors out there can rest assured that this does indeed fit onto a standard DVD/media shelf. Due to popular demand (I'm assuming, anyway) 20th century fox did away with the over-sized ""coffee table book"" display package in favor of a new standardized, space-conscious design. And in addition there is no more sliding the discs in and out of scratchy cardboard sleeves because the new case is plastic with 4 double-sided plastic flippers (like most standard double disc BDs/DVDs). All together the whole collection takes up exactly the same space as 2 standard blu-ray cases with the spine facing out. Great collection finally in a sensible sized package!

However, the trade off here for the new compact size is that it no longer includes the 16 page booklet with anecdotal production notes, etc., that the big fat old package did. You're basically just paying for the discs here, but I'm pretty much cool with that.",1343952000,,1416,4.875518672199171
2504385,5,B000E6ESIK,This is the perfect addition to any movie collection. I've been a Mel Brooks for years and I couldn't be happier that these classics have made it to Blu-Ray. These classics bring back a form of intelligent comedy which is lost today amongst simple juvenile fart jokes.,1343606400,,268,4.723404255319149
2504386,5,B000E6ESIK,Not sure about all the posts about the package being too big for dvd racks and the blu rays being in sleeves. Mine came in a standard hieght blu ray case that holds all the discs. No sleeves! So very very glad I purchased this!!!!!!!!!,1343260800,,235,4.2444444444444445

To those who will comment about my equipment calibration etc. I must say save your breath, I have top of theline samsung TV which shows most Bluerays great. Just handfull have sud-standard coding and this collection is one of them.

2504388,3,B000E6ESIK,"This collection contains unfunny duds like The Twelve Chairs, Silent Movie and Robin Hood: Men in Tights, yet not what is arguably his best and funniest film, The Producers.  What gives?  Why is it that Greatest Hits CDs and movie collections like this NEVER get it right?  NEVER.  And this isn't a matter of taste or opinion; nobody thinks those three films are laff riots.  Not only does The Producers have Gene Wilder (as does Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein) but it has Zero Mostel, Kenneth Mars AND an Oscar-winning script.  This is all moot for me anyway, as I already have all the funny ones in this collection.",1343174400,2,625,4.6880733944954125
2504389,2,B000E6ESIK,"Greetings fellow amazonians I bought this because spaceballs was my favorite movie growing up and working as a carney you don't get much free time except late at night so I felt these other movies would make a great addition to my collection. Mongo, who works at the funhouse, wanted to see them too. He had never seen mel brooks before and wanted to see why I was so excited.

First we watched spaceballs which was funnier then I remembered with barf and pizza the hut. Then it was onto blazing saddles which started out ok, but when mongo saw the character ""mongo"" he started to get upset. He couldn't believe that his mother would have named him after that guy. I told him that the actor may have been his real father, he never met him, so it could be a family name. He really didn't like that! He jumped up on my couch and started ramming me with his spiderman helmet. I finally had to ducktape him to a chair to calm him down, but that didn't work either he broke the chair, picked up my blu ray player and threw it out the window. Finally, I saw him run threw the night with an aluminium baseball bat beating my blu ray player through out the fairgrounds.

When I saw that this set was being released on blu ray, I was psyched and ordered it right away. For those of you wondering, each movie is it's own blu ray disc and these are not bootlegs.

This item was supposed to come after christmas because it required a bit longer to process and i ordered it the week before christmas  so I had to send it to his house but they emailed me to tell me it was processed in time and I had my stepmom intercept it.  I had planned to print the amazon page and wrap it and tell him to look for it in the mail.  Thanks to amazons great service I was able to give him the actual movies and 3 days later my little sister had men in tights as a ringtone  .  Now I just need to get one for my husband and myself.

It says that ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" is previously unreleased.  Oddly enough, as I read these reviews and ponder whether I want to purchase this collection or not, I hold in my hands a DVD of ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" that I picked up in a major chain drugstore a few years back.  A no frills package with widescreen presentation, HBO special, and trailer.  It makes me ponder the phrase, ""previously unreleased"", and wonder what it actually means.  Maybe it means the editing/cut is different from what I purchased?  Again, just a bit puzzled.  In any event, I love movie compilations because of the advantage in pricing so I just might be tempted to purchase this set in the near future.",1294444800,,867,4.584415584415584

Are some of the movies bombs?  Sure.  But they're still great art.  Men in Tights is awful.  I can still remember struggling to stay awake when I first saw it in the drive-in.  But a bad Mel Brooks movie still beats much of the schlock that's been put out since then.

Must See Classics:

* Blazing Saddles
* Young Frankenstein
* High Anxiety
* History of the World
* Silent Movie

These classics are required viewing for anyone wishing to assimilate into American pop culture.  These are the sources of classic lines like: ""More beans Mr. Taggart?"", ""it's good to be king"", and ""go back and get a sh-load of dimes.""

Think of ""Men in Tights"" and ""Twelve Chairs"" to be bonus features, then you won't feel like a chump for buying them.",1289865600,,897,4.566037735849057

2504521,1,B000E6ESIK,"DISCLAIMER:  Other than changing the title of this review, I am leaving the text exactly as written in the original publication.  However, I must now preface the original review with the following disclaimer:  I did check all the DVDs in this box against my old VHS tapes, and the results are exactly as stated below.  However, it appears likely that my conclusions may be wrong.  For an interesting and informative discussion on different ways movies may be cropped for theatrical, VHS, and DVD releases, read my original review, but also read the comments which follow it.  - D.Auer, original reviewer, 11/9/12.  ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:

Fox should be ashamed of what it has done to these movies!  All eight of these movies are presented as being ""wide screen"".  However, for most of them this is achieved by removing the top and bottom of the old full screen image.

I compared all eight of these DVDs to the VHS releases, and found that five of the movies have been cropped to make them appear ""widescreen"".  The VHS formats are in a 16 x 12 ratio (the proportaions of the old-fashioned standard US TV screen).  Fox has removed the top eighth and bottom eighth of each movie to make them fill the new 16 x 9 ratio widescreen TVs.  The following five movies in this set have been cropped:  Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety, Silent Movie, To Be or Not To Be, Robin Hood.  The DVDs in this set present only 3/4 of the image that was shown on the old VHS releases.
The other three (Twelve Chairs, Blazing Saddles, History of the World, Part 1) appear to be true wide-screen releases.  The DVDs show the full picture from the VHS releases, but wider.

When will studios understand that what most buyers want is the full image of the original movie, regardless of its proportions?  Cutting part of the image to make it appear to fit your TV screen is butchering the original product.  Please do not promote this practice with the purchase of this set; wait for a proper release.",1234742400,82,1977,4.642651296829971

I ordered this when it was a DoD and I knew I was going to be off of work for a few weeks recovering from surgery.  It was a perfect distraction.

To be honest, I ordered it mainly for Blazing Saddles, History of the World, Part 1 and Young Frankenstein.  I had forgotten how much I enjoyed To Be or Not to Be and High Anxiety. That was a pleasant surprise.

I wasn't sure if he would like them, but I know he likes a good laugh. Well, he loved them. The funny thing about these movies is, no matter how many times you've seen them, you notice something that you missed before (probably because you're laughing so much).

2504578,3,B000E6ESIK,"First off, I love Mel Brooks. So when i heard of this collection i was thrilled. However, Being that this is the Mel Brooks collection, I am saddened by it's lack of Brooks movies. Noticably missing from this set 'The Producers, SPACEBALLS, Life Stinks"" and more. Spaceballs was one of Brook's hugest theatrical film release but in the Brooks Collection it's missing in action. The Producers with Gene Wilder also MIA, LIfe Stinks not the greatest Brooks film ever but still it to is MIA. i would like to see a Full Collection of Mel Brooks. Most of the films in this set I ALREADY OWN. Why would I repurchase them for poor transfers, poor features and a few only available 'here' movies. There are Great movies in this set, well worth the watch and the purchase if you are just starting your Mel Brooks dvd collecting. however the studios are greedy and will eventually release the 'only here' movies seprately. I'll wait until then, for you first timers go right ahead and spend your $100-50 bucks and enjoy. but i hope they release a COMPLETE COLLECTION! with more features from Brooks and anyone else willing to participate in them.",1199491200,,1136,4.685

2504615,4,B000E6ESIK,"I acquired this collection in order to acquaint the kids with the Mel Brooks style of humor.  His ideas hold up to the test of time remarkably well.  We were especially surprised by To Be or Not to Be - a film we were not aware of, and one which every theatre lover will enjoy. Mel is particularly good in this story about a couple of Polish actors surviving the Nazi occupation.  In other films, Mel's subversive ironies still sound fresh. Ignore the puerile jokes and the way the pacing drags at times. In the history of cinematic comedy, Mel ranks way up there.",1187049600,2,564,4.403846153846154

I have seen quite a few of the Mel Brooks movies before I bought this set, but what surprised me were the entertainment value of the movies that I hadn't watched before. High Anxiety and To Be or Not to Be are more coherent than the famous Mel Brooks movies and that makes them great films if you want some light comedy. Enjoy!",1181779200,2,434,4.304878048780488
2504618,5,B000E6ESIK,"I bought this for my husband but it, in fact, was a treat for myself as well. This is a collection any fan of Mel Brooks should have and the discs are in small, individual cases which house in a single, thin box. In other words, you get eight films that take up very little space. If you or anyone you know enjoys Mel Brooks' films, this is a must-have.",1179100800,3,353,4.057142857142857
2504619,4,B000E6ESIK,"This set is nice, but I can't believe the studios haven't released this same collection in HD format yet. What is currently holding me from buying a Blu-Ray player is exactly the lack of any decent comedy movies in Blu-Ray format. Instead, the studios seem to think that releasing Vin Diesel and Stallone movies is somehow a priority for HD format releases. As if seeing explosions in HD would make any difference!.

Instead, I'm a little miffed that in order to get ""Silent Movie"", and ""High Anxiety"", two of the titles from Mel that I've been waiting for on DVD for years now, I have to repurchase 3 others that I had already bought on DVD.  I really hate this aspect of DVD special packaging and collectors editions.  I wouldn't mind it all that much if I thought Mel got a decent cut of the dough I spent, but I know the soul-sucking studio probably gets 99%, and Mel doesn't get enough to buy a plate of beans.",1173398400,3,700,4.361538461538461
2504661,4,B000E6ESIK,"For those who like Mel Brooks and are upgrading from tape to DVD, this is a bargain. Not every film is equally strong, but Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Robin Hood: Men in Tights are worth the price of this collection alone. Not all are the films are comedies, but most are. The bonus material is OK, particularly a long interview with Mel Brooks that is really just an audio track. This interview gives some real insight into how the creative process works for Brooks. Happy endings are a part of the Mel Brooks tradition, and these are found here, along with his unique style of humor that pokes fun at everyone and everything... even Mel Brooks himself.",1171584000,4,666,4.6525423728813555

2504668,4,B000E6ESIK,"Many fans who grew up watching Mel's early movies of the 60's and 70's, would probably agree that ""Blazing Saddles"" (along with the first ""Producers"" and ""Young Frankenstein"") represents his finest work. Therefore, I was disappointed to discover that a number of classic scenes have been cut from this version of ""Blazing Saddles."" In a single casual viewing, I noticed that (at least) the following scenes are missing:

 1) The scene where Mongo is tricked by Sheriff Bart into duelling with a mechanical sheriff.

 2) The scene where Mongo is tricked by Sheriff Bart into diving down the town's well to search for hidden treasure.

 3) The scene where the gibberish-speaking prospector (""Gabby Johnson"") tries to explain why the dynamite didn't go off.

Yes, getting all these great Mel Brooks movies for under $60.00 was a great value. But to have Brooks' ""crown jewel"" edited in such a way was a great disappointment.",1167955200,5,921,4.980392156862745

2504745,5,B000E6ESIK,"Okay, I admit I was pretty dissapointed to not see the 2004 SE release of Blazing Saddles, but since my Dad owns the SE release already, I'm not too worried. Otherwise this is sheer kick-ass movie set of my favorite comedy director of all time (along David Zucker), Mel Brooks.

Here are my given thoughts of the eight movies presented in this set:

Blazing Saddles-10/10 One of my all-time favorite comedies, this one literally pokes fun at all the early Western movies we've seen. A recently hired black sheriff tries to protect the peaceful town of Rock Ridge from certain troubles, most of which come from Attorney General Hedy Lamarr (""That's Hedley!"") trying to destroy the town and build a railroad across the area.

High Anxiety-9/10 A hilarious sendup to the Hitchcock stories, this one shows Dr. Richard A. Thorndyke, a psychiatrist with an huge fear of heights, become head of a pyschiatric institute, and realizes that he's dealing with a much bigger fear than his own.

History of the World, Part I-8/10 Hilarious. This one is a ragbag of sketches, showing the timeline from the evolution of men to the Roman Era, to Spanish Catholic conversion to the French Revolution, all shown Brooks style. The Spanish Inquisition song, is a real hoot.

Robin Hood: Men In Tights-7/10 Not Brooks's best, but still quite enjoyable. It's basically a parody on Robin Hood, which its jokes hit more than miss.

Silent Movie-8/10 First time I've seen it, and I like it. The title here explains it all: A silent movie about a crew of moviemakers making a silent movie for the Big Studios before the company Engulf and Devour takes over the studio. A simple plot, but still lots of fun.

The Twelve Chairs-7/10 Even the most underrated Brooks film has some appeal, because despite of the lack of laughs, its storyline with a twist ending brings it home. Russian clerk Ippolit (Ron Moody) tries to find his mother's fortune stored in the cushion of one of the 12 dining room chairs before Rev. Fyodor (Dom DeLuise) finds it for himself. Fyodor brings most of the laughs of this whole movie with his maniacal character and hilarious dialogue.

To Be Or Not To Be-10/10 A hilarious adaption of the old WWII story, as a Polish actor and his wife try to save themselves and the other actors of their theatre from Nazism cropping all over Poland.

Young Frankenstein-10/10 Great sendup to Frankenstein. Peter Boyle plays an excellent monster, but the best preformance comes from Gene Wilder as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, who gains the inheritance of his father and takes the science of ressurrecting a being onto himself.

Despite the double dipping of Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, the majority of this set is classic. So what are you waiting for? Don't be the Piss boy and buy this set! ""It's good to be the king.""",1149465600,19,2815,4.797520661157025
2504746,4,B000E6ESIK,"FYI everyone, Mel Brooks only shot TWO films in wide screen: ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""History of the World Part 1"".

If you compare the rest of the films to the original full frame laserdiscs you will see that FOX just masked off the top & bottom of the picture to make the films look widescreen.  They should have been presented in full frame to give us the complete picture, some signs & faces get cut off.

So now I have to keep my 1987 laserdiscs, even though these new transfers look sharper.

The missing films not in this box set are not owned by 20th Century Fox. We are lucky they made a special arrangement with Warner Brothers to include Blazing Saddles (although it is the old master) in this set.

""The Producers"" , ""Space Balls"" and ""Life Stinks"" are owned by MGM.
""Dracula Dead and Loving it"" is distributed by Warner Brothers & owned by Castlerock.",1149379200,221,862,4.464968152866242
2504747,3,B000E6ESIK,"More than anything else, this comprehensive eight-disc set really shows the peaks and valleys of Mel Brooks' filmmaking career even as it unfortunately leaves out key films like the original 1968 version of ""The Producers"", an auspicious debut and now a comedy classic. Chronologically, this collection starts with the least known of Brooks' films, 1970's ""The Twelve Chairs"" and then continues with his twin comedy peaks from 1974, ""Blazing Saddles"" and my personal favorite, ""Young Frankenstein"". There is a noticeable artistic decline with 1976's ""Silent Movie"", 1977's ""High Anxiety"" and most notoriously, 1981's ""The History of the World, Part I"" - all of which, not coincidentally, have Brooks as star as well as director. There is a surprisingly faithful 1983 remake of Ernst Lubitsch's WWII classic, ""To Be or Not to Be"", where Brooks co-stars with his wife Anne Bancroft but does not direct. Lastly, there is 1993's ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" where Brooks goes back behind the camera. All provide certain virtues even if in some cases, they are hard to find, and at the very least, they show Brooks' genuine dexterity as a director.

Set in the Soviet Union circa 1927, ""The Twelve Chairs"" is actually a funny treasure-hunt fable about greed and bureaucracy that bears some influence of Lubitsch's classic ""Ninotchka"". Fresh from ""The Producers"" and bearing certain similarities to the buddy aspect of that film, Brooks lets the story versus the schitck dominate with Frank Langella perfectly venal as a small-time con man, Ron Moody as a desperate ex-nobleman and Dom DeLuise as an unctuous priest. Although some of the more politically incorrect humor has dated somewhat, ""Blazing Saddles"" is a still hilariously tasteless western spoof with very funny turns by Gene Wilder as the Waco Kid and Madeline Kahn as the Teutonic Titwillow, Lili Von Schtupp. In vivid black-and-white, ""Young Frankenstein"" is an almost perfect parody of the classic 1930's Universal horror films with Wilder and Kahn again in peak form, as well as solid comedy work from Marty Feldman as Igor, Cloris Leachman as Nurse Blucher, Peter Boyle as the monster and Gene Hackman as a blind monk.

Filled with guest star cameos and physical comedy inspired by Chaplin and Keaton, ""Silent Movie"" basically describes the execution of this fitfully funny film about three Hollywood cohorts trying to revive their careers by producing the first silent movie in forty years. The Hitchcock-inspired ""High Anxiety"" and the free-for-all hodgepodge ""History of the World, Part I"" both have big laughs and hilarious, scene-stealing women - Kahn and Leachman in both, Bea Arthur as a Roman unemployment clerk in the latter - but not enough attractions despite clever premises that are woefully underdeveloped. With a strong cast including Bancroft, Charles Durning and Jose Ferrer, ""To Be or Not to Be"" has a comparatively solid storyline in detailing the efforts of a Polish acting troupe to thwart the Nazis. It's just too bad that Lubitsch's 1942 original with Jack Benny and Carole Lombard is so much better. Even though Cary Elwes does a sincere job in the title role, ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" seems to take more inspiration from Monty Python than Brooks, but the result still doesn't get above mediocre despite some funny lines.

The extras are minimal on the individual DVDs and there is sadly no special feature related to Brooks' career exclusive to this box set. There are making-of featurettes with ""Young Frankenstein"", ""To Be or Not to Be"" and ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"".  There is an hour-long interview with Brooks on ""Blazing Saddles"", and only ""Young Frankenstein"" has a feature-length commentary track. Unfortunately, none of these extras are specific to the collection. Unless you're a diehard Brooks fanatic, it is probably best to buy the special editions of ""Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein"" DVDs individually. Watching these films sequentially, one appreciates what a grand comic talent Brooks is, but the set also highlights how inconsistent he can be.",1148688000,8,4057,5.170471841704718

2504791,4,B000E6ESIK,"Most of the movies here are classics which makes it a problem if you don't want all the movies. The version of ""Blazing Saddles"" is the earlier release from Warner which doesn't look as good as the 30th Anniversary re-release and the extras aren't any great shakes. The transfer looks so-so and lacks the sharper look of the later 30th Anniversary Edition. ""Young Frankenstein"" resembles the first DVD release of the film from Fox with the same extras. Reportedly ""Young Frankenstein"" was supposed to be remastered in anamorphic widescreen but the wrong master used or the wrong discs shipped with this set. For those that care it's not anamorphic. The film looks extremely good but if you already have these classic films, I'd suggest waiting for these to be released individually.

Fans of Brooks will be buying this for the previously unreleased films ""Silent Movie"", ""Robin Hood:Men in Tights"", ""To Be or Not to Be"" (which Brooks didn't direct but stars in) and ""High Anxiety"". All these films look pretty good here (although ""The Twelve Chairs"" is probably going to be of the least interest to fans that grew up on Brooks other classic films). ""Robin Hood"" comes with an featurette produced for HBO on the film. Most of the others come only with theatrical trailer(s). ""To Be or Not To Be"" comes with a short featurette and some profiles of Brooks, the late Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning. Clearly they weren't produced for the DVD but must be some sort of promotional bits for another format (you're guess is as good as mine)possibly for an Electtronic Press Book.

2504832,5,B000E6ESIK,"It's the Alien Quadrilogy all over again.  Several of these disks I have wanted desparately for years (High Anxiety, Silent Movie) some I already own, and one I would not take if they came with a free box of cereal.  so 80 bucks with shipping is just too much.  I'll rent them from (un-named postal rental company) and wait a month or two until they're all available separately, like they did with the set mentioned up top.

But seriously, this is some of Mel's greatest work.

Twelve Chairs, based on a russian folk tale (As was the Fred Allen movie _It's In the Bag_) is a charming little film. First time Mel and Dom Deluise worked together, and he got magnificent comedy from Ron Moody, and beat everybody to the punch with Frank Langella.  A forgotten gem.

Young Frankenstein.  Possibly the greatest spoof of all time.  And Mel has three of the remaining four of the top five in this set as well.  (I gotta put Airplane! in there too, but I digress.)  I have always said there's a great test of a spoof: take all the jokes out.  If it's still a good example of the genre you're spoofing, you've got a great film.  YF is a note perfect Frankenstein film, which is why it holds up so well as a comedy.  The characters are real, the things they go through make a semblance of sense, and the comedy is icing on the cake. The same holds true of High Anxiety, Blazing Saddles and Silent Movie.  These films are the strongest work of one of America's funniest directors.

History of the World Part 1 was a fine film, but compared to what came before, it's quite a drop.  Lots of trademark Brooks raunchy jokes, a musical number I still hum, and Hitler on Ice.  But there wasn't quite enough plot to make it a complete experience.  Alas, we would never see true Classic Brooks again.

I'm ashamed to say I'd not heard of the original To Be or Not To Be before I'd seen Mel's remake.  So for a while I was walking on air. ""He's remembered how to to tell a full story again!"" I said.  When I learned it was a remake I was disappointed I was saddened, but not for long.  I consider this to be a far superior film than the original, and Mel's zany madcap style worked better (for me anyway) than Jack Benny's deadpan character in the first.  Well worth seeing.

Robin Hood.  Ugh.  All I can say (And I'm far from the first or the last) but Mel did this FAR better decades before on _When Things Were Rotten_.

To be fair, it's a little less than 10 bucks a film.  But I'm very hesitant to re-buy films I have since they appear to be the same, if not less, than what I have, not to mention one film I simply don't want.

Break 'em up, here's my money.  Force the box on me, and it's rental all the way.

And do it fast. Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup.",1143763200,21,2754,4.226487523992322
2504833,5,B000E6ESIK,"This collection definitely represents Brooks at his best. Most of these movies are more sophisticated satire, as opposed to goofball spoofs like some that were left out. At least with the movies made in the 70s, there is a recurrent theme of jazz and chess. There's at least one reference to one if not both of these in Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, and History of the World. It's been a long time since I've seen the others, so I don't remember if they have it, but I'm sure it's in there somewhere!

Shining among these discs has to be The Tweleve Chairs. I think it would be hard to classify this as a comedy. It really is more of a drama with some comedic moments. It's usually the most overlooked of his films. Set in post-revolution Russian, the story follows a con artist and a deposed nobleman in search of a chair his mother had hidden the family jewels. It also features another fine opening song penned by Mel.

Blazing Saddles is a Warner Brothers product, and should have the WB logo stamped on the disc. MGM has the rights to The Producers, Spaceballs and Dracula, Dead and Loving It. Their parent company is Sony, and Fox and Sony don't get along, most of the time. <g>

It would have been a great idea to re-release new versions of Young Frankenstein and History of the World Part 1. Both are not anamorphically enhanced and are ""worthless"" to someone who has a widescreen TV.

It's fantastic to see some of the titles released for the first time (High Anxiety, for one). It makes me very, very, very nervous to purchase a box set for only a few films. By not releasing them separately or redoing certain titles, you can see the greed of the 20th Century Fox Corporation. I just can't see spending $70 on these titles when individual releases would probably sell a lot more.

Had the previously released Fox titles been redone, this would be a great box set, instead of only a good one.

Nurse Diesel where are you, perhaps your getting the newspaper with your friend with the Tin Teeth in San Francisco..... Or fixing BLOODY MARY with the snappy peppy!

Mel get it together and RELEASE "" HIGH ANXIETY "" by itself! PLEASEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1141948800,6,391,5.627118644067797
2504871,5,B000E6ESIK,"Like many of the others, I have been waiting for one of the movies in this set to come out on DVD...High Anxiety. I have no problem selling my copies of Blazing Saddles, History of the World Part 1, and Young Frankenstein since they will all be in the box set. Now, I'm as big a fan of Mel Brooks as anyone else, and would LOVE to see a box set come out with all of his films. I've read where some people are disappointed that the original Producers, Spaceballs and Life Stinks are not included in this set. I hope this isn't news to anyone, but the rights to those films are owned by MGM studios. These films are all released by FOX. Perhaps in the near future, MGM will release a box set, too, but until then, I'll be enjoying this set.",1141603200,15,738,4.131944444444445
2504872,5,B000E6ESIK,"Aside from all the negatives I have read about the box set, I think it is awsome. I have been a Mel Brooks fan for longer than I care to admit. I don't care if you can only get some of these titles in the box set only (at least at first). I am just so glad they will be available on dvd!

Mel, I love you!",1141603200,6,305,3.5522388059701493
2504873,3,B000E6ESIK,"I would have liked to see some substitutions on this list.  Why not the original Producers?  Where is Life Stinks?  I realize that was not one of his more popular ones, but surely it has more fans than Silent Movie and probably To Be Or Not to Be as well.  But I am glad to see Dracula: Dead and Loving It Did Not make the cut.

All in all, I just don't really like the idea of a ""box set"" that is not complete.  Either come out with a full 11 movie box set starting with The Producers and ending with Dracula or better yet wait and have a 12 disc set starting and ending with The Producers (1968 and 2005).",1141603200,,607,3.975206611570248
2504874,5,B000E6ESIK,"I have been a huge fan of Mel Brooks since first viewing Spaceballs several years ago. This is the type of deal I have been waiting for to come out. And yes, I have also been waiting for Robin Hood: Men in Tights to come out on DVD. Now that someone finally has, I'm going to buy that boxset the day it comes out. Despite that I own Blazing Saddles, History of the World: Part 1, and Young Frankenstein (and Spaceballs, but that's not in the set), I will still buy boxset since of the other 4 discs, only Robin Hood have I seen. I've wanted to see the others, but they're extremely hard to find on DVD. It's very hard to find most of Mel Brooks' movies on DVD, and I know because I've tried my hardest! Yes, you can find them online but I've had issues with online buying that has forced me to ceaseany more online purchasing. Anyways, I have yet to see a movie by Mel Brooks that I have not liked. I thought the new Producers movie was good but I heard the old one was better, though I have yet to see that one yet as well. To conclude, Even if Robin Hood is your main objective in this boxset, all the other movie either are or have got to be just as good. Mel Brooks is a genious in his work and I say buy his products; I know I will and have!",1141430400,5,1246,3.988
2504875,1,B000E6ESIK,"Well then I guess it is unanimous!  I also only wanted 'Robin Hood' on DVD and yet they got me again!  I have been on the waiting list for the DVD for years and still I am waiting just to get that movie.  Oh well, at least I still have a VCR.",1141430400,5,242,3.6153846153846154
2504876,4,B000E6ESIK,I ordered this set from Amazon and my copy of Young Frankenstein definitely was anamorphic.  I was lucky to have gotten one of the correct copies.  If you got a non-anamorphic copy of YF you should call Fox or exchange it where you bought it.,1141344000,,242,4.355555555555555
2504877,1,B000E6ESIK,"See this a problem right here, all i was wantin was the Robin Hood : Men In Tights, I been waitin for years, now FOX put it in a box set where i gotta spend $70 for it? Box set before single releases, thats a mess. Yea im mad, I mad cuz its a marketing technique, the box set. I think it be fair to the consumer to sell them single. N 2 of the dvds in this set are already done released. So whats up with that? What Is Up With That?",1141344000,6,432,3.6559139784946235
