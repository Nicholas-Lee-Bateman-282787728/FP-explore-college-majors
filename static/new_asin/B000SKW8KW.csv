The story is believeable, They don't insult your intelligance with massive plot holes. And while the acting isn't fantastic, it's not so bad that it detracts from the movie. Shauna O'Brien and Jaquline Lovell are without a doubt the best actresses in it.
The plot is straight forward (spoilers alert) A beautiful women in a Linda Carter business suit hires the main character, a Private investigator to find her sister, Who disapeared in a Town called Lost Lake. judging by the location I think it's just out side Camp Cyrstal lake. Along the way, he meets up with a hippie hitchhiker named Trix (Lovell). Once they get to town Trix helps our good Detective (By now I'm sure you've guessed I can't remember his name) search for the missing sister. who was kidnapped by two lesbian witches (real orginal) played by Shauna O'brien and Kira Reed. We find out that the Witches blackmailed the Linda Carter suited lady to hire this detective because they believe he is the son of their cult leader Damien (hence the title) The Witches Kidnap Trix but the Detective saves the day and all is right with the world.

The sex scenes are of a good quality cinematography and well performed. Unlike other movies I've seen they are also not ridiculiously short. If you like your porn to have a story line then watch Damien's Seed.",1265414400,,1419,4.698795180722891
