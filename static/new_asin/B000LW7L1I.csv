2715166,4,B000LW7L1I,"I was pretty well riveted throughout, thought it very good.  Acting by John Hannah was terrific.  A real find.",1422230400,,110,4.7368421052631575
2715167,5,B000LW7L1I,Great. Paralleling genuine amnesia and a fraud.,1419638400,,47,5.857142857142857
2715168,1,B000LW7L1I,amazon says it is 180 min. the one I received is only 145 min.,1417651200,2,62,3.5
2715169,4,B000LW7L1I,The giveaway here is that John Hannah usually plays the good guy in films and the actor who plays his quarry is usually cast as a bad guy. Otherwise an entertaining movie.,1411516800,,171,4.375
2715170,5,B000LW7L1I,Watched this on TV.  If you love British mysteries you should love this one.  Captivating from the very beginning.  All the pieces fit in the end but during the movie it keeps you guessing.,1408233600,,189,4.5
2715171,4,B000LW7L1I,I caught this part way in when it was on tv and was really keen to see the whole thing and have been trying to get it for years... was really glad to finally find it and wasn't disappointed to see it in it's entirety. Well acted and well put together.. definitely another quality UK crime thriller.,1206921600,4,298,4.245614035087719
2715172,1,B000LW7L1I,"The film is really a mess. After we watched it, we sat there and said, ""Why? Why? Why?"" and ultimately decided the writer/s just decided to sting a bunch of red herrings amd illogical events together and call it a screenplay. If you do decide to watch...think about all the plot elements afterwards and you'll see what we mean.",1197936000,2,327,4.559322033898305
2715173,5,B000LW7L1I,"Bit by bit, the movie reveals the secrets of its characters.

At first  I was disappointed with the ending but  after some reflection, I see what the screenwriter was doing.",1195862400,3,173,4.7
2715174,5,B000LW7L1I,I watched this largely because I've been impressed with John Hannah's other performances. I was equally impressed here with both the actor and the production. A real thriller; I didn't want to turn it off and watched it at one sitting. It's a double mystery; the two stories are interwoven. It's all the more eerie because it's so plausible. Give it a try.,1185062400,14,356,4.666666666666667
2715175,5,B000LW7L1I,"I purchased this DVD not having heard of it. I am a fan of the stars, John Hannah,Jemma Redgrave and Patrick Malahide. The story is gripping from the first scene and is an excellent,unusual who-dunnit. Well acted (bravo, John Hannah) well directed and a great script. I highly recommend it.",1174176000,21,290,4.82
8164609,5,B000LW7L1I,I loved it. Not many movies keep me guessing but this one did!,1514851200,,62,3.8461538461538463
8164610,3,B000LW7L1I,"Second viewing of this film, and really once was enough. This is a mini series that could have been wrapped up into one.

Amnesia is the tale of a British cop, MAC, played by John Hannah. He goes home one day to find a missing wife, he searches everywhere and hears a door close. He rubs out back and catches a glimpse of his wife as she is running away. No idea where she is and why she left. Soon his colleagues begin to wonder if he had something to do with her disappearance. Eventually he discovers his wife was having an affair with his colleague.

At about the same time Mac was investigating a man who claims he has amnesia. Mac thinks the man is a con and has conned several women out if their money. This detective work goes on for several months, and at the same time Mac is looking for his wife,seeing a therapist,and wondering if he is suffering from amnesia. This is the crux of the series. Characters come and go, and if you want to know the result see the film, free if you have Amazon Prime.
