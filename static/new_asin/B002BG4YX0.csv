8361352,3,B002BG4YX0,"Disc had a sticky substance on it near the center which caused it to get lodged in my dvd player.  The player would not allow the disc to drop down into the tray, it ruined my player.",1429833600,,183,3.945945945945946
8361353,1,B002BG4YX0,"The book on which it was based 'Watch My Back'..excellent.
This movie...crapolla.
Choppy, bad direction, at least the main character could have had a Coventry accent !",1377820800,,167,5.222222222222222
8361354,5,B002BG4YX0,"I loved this movie. It gave me a nostalgic trip to my disco days. I bought the book the movie was based on and could identify some of the characters from the book in the movie. The movie seemed very realistic, names changed to protect the innocent or guilty if you prefer. It begged the question, what would you do if you were faced with a fight or flight situation? I never realized London clubs were so rough. I real eye opener.",1369958400,,430,4.2560975609756095
8361355,5,B002BG4YX0,Excellent film with an outstanding cast!  Colin Salmon is such a natural actor. Every character's performance were strong!  Must see!,1360281600,,133,5.6
8361356,3,B002BG4YX0,"I've seen too many movies as of recent where there was a genuinely good idea that just didn't play out well. This is one of those movies.

Here's the scoop. Danny is separated from his wife who has custody of their two young daughters. He's a decent sort but a bit of a schlub. He holds a menial job cleaning up in a factory. He seems to have had problems with depression in his past and possibly substance abuse. He thinks he has it in him to become a writer. One day, while out with his daughters, he gets his butt kicked by some thugs. He's embarrassed. He's fascinated by boxing and visits a local gym to watch the guys work out and box. The owner, who also owns a local disco, takes him in and starts showing him a few things. Soon he's helping the owner as a bouncer at the disco and his life begins to change. There are some sub plots but this will suffice.

Here again you have a good idea with a mediocre script. There's a certain natural evolution to the story but some elements are forced. You like Danny and you like to see him transform. He's good with his daughters and is diligent about writing down his thoughts, but some of the dialogue, along with Danny's writings, could have been much better. And some of the transformations are heavy handed. The difference between the earlier and later scenes with him and his daughters is too obvious.

When he starts to grow some stones, and become more self assured, it does your heart good. This is some of the better stuff in the movie. Louis, the club owner, and Rob, his right hand man are good, thoughtful people, but they're tough when they have to be. They become friends and it's a good thing for Danny. He needs this in his life. When things go way south with Sparky (another of the group) and turn uber violent, all know what has to be done.

Danny's acting is Okay. Louis and Rob are exceptional. They really help make this film watchable. The production values are as good as they need to be. Seeing the disco era in England is a real slice. This helps add some of the color to things. This isn't a bad watch by any means but it could have been much better.",1323302400,,2127,4.296758104738155
8361357,4,B002BG4YX0,"I saw this almost by accident not knowing in advance that it was based on Geoff Thompsons 'Watch My Back'. The book details his life as a doorman in the 80's (in the UK). A riveting and easy read, with a seemingly never-ending stream of vividly told set pieces where Geoff has to deal with a thug, bully, drunk and always wins. The film has a somewhat different story neccessarily, but has a few of the classic set pieces from the book.

In the film Danny is the man who suffers a beating and joins a boxing club in desperation (early in the film you'll spot Geoff Thompson in a couple of scenes at the boxing club). Danny's life is falling apart, he's separated and his kids are all that holds him together. Becoming a Doorman is the making of him, but it also puts him in conflict with a local gangster....

Colin Salmon is the standout actor for me. He plays Louis the head doorman, a man so cool, you would freeze if he so much looked at you. At 6' 4"" Salmon has the size and voice to pull this role off effortlessly. Interestingly in reality the head doorman was John and he was a 5' 8"" powerhouse.

So overall an entertaining film with a good story with an underlying set of moral values that will make you think.",1246147200,,1219,4.268398268398268
