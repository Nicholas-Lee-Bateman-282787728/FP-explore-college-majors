8260172,5,B0015XHR2A,"I think this is one of the best documentaries regarding the council on foreign relations (CFR) and their strangle hold on the US government.  Mr. Gonzalez presents the facts.  This isn't sensationalized like some documentaries on this topic.  It is straightforward, documented exhaustively, and convincing.  I highly recommend this DVD.  Mr. Gonzalez is from Cuba and his accent can make his narration difficult to catch, but it is more than worth the work required.  I have his books also, and they are written in the same manner, documented completely so you can check out his sources and back read to see where he is getting his information.  He is an excellent writer and his DVD is top notch.",1525996800,,697,4.8559322033898304

8260174,5,B0015XHR2A,"Mr. Gonzalez did his research on this one. I know more about my government after watching this DVD than I ever learned in school. Some of this stuff makes you cringe, especially after you realize that it's true! Very informative although the background music can get a bit tedious at times but overall a very good DVD.",1294876800,4,318,4.5964912280701755
8260175,5,B0015XHR2A,"Over the years, even the most naive American has had a diffuse suspicion that there must be a secret reason why, most of the time, our government helps our enemies and betrays our friends. Servando Gonzalez provides exhaustive evidence proving that the reason for this is because a group of rich, powerful individuals have conspired to infiltrate the U.S. Government and most of the American life. This group of conspirators, the Invisible Government of the United States, reside at the Harold Pratt House in Manhattan, headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations - an organization that acts like a secret society.

  In this program, the first of the TruthLies series, Gonzalez shows how this corrupt organization operates, and what their plans are. He also provides ample information showing that, behind almost every act of treason committed against the peoples of the U.S., Latin America, and the world, there has been one or more CFR members.

  Gonzalez explains how CFR's secret agents infiltrated in the U.S. Government manipulated President Truman to create the CIA and the National Security Council. According to Gonzalez, since its creation in 1947, the CIA has never served the interests of the American people, but of Wall Street bankers and oil transnational corporations. Gonzalez also shows that the NSC is a key element in understanding how the CFR conspirators, through selective flow of information, have gained almost total control over American presidents, treating them like mushrooms: keeping them in the dark and feeding them manure.

  He shows graphic evidence of CFR conspirators in the NSC commanding the Commanders-in-Chief, and the reasons why, like in the cases of Korea and Vietnam, the Iraq war was lost even before it began.

Servando Gonzalez is the author of The Secret Fidel Castro: Deconstructing the Symbol, The Nuclear Deception: Nikita Khrushchev and the Cuban Missile Crisis, and La madre de todas las conspiraciones: una novela de ideas subversivas [in Spanish], all available at Amazon.com.",1208131200,13,2039,5.284829721362229
