8717505,5,B00Y3MP1XW,"This is the best recording you will ever hear. The voices are combined impeccably and so professionally sung with the correct nuances and style for the period and the country from which each of madrigals came. The sound is very different from the current King's Singer's sound, and I find this one to be far superior. There is depth and heft in the sound as much as there is airy freedom and fluidity in execution. Tony's Holt's voice is especially sumptuous as his baritone is lush and full of ring and space.  Inimitable.",1489536000,,523,4.623655913978495
8717506,5,B00Y3MP1XW,"If you're interested in the history of the madrigal, this set of the BBC series is a wonderfully comprehensive coverage of it, with examples sung by one of the best madrigal groups hailing from England. It covers the early origins of the madrigal form in Italy, goes on to demonstrate variations of it that flourished in Spain and Germany, and  finally the ultimate flowering  of it in the many madrigal composers of English fame such as John Dowland, William Byrd, Thomas Morley, and Orlando Gibbons, among many others. All are delightfully rendered by this amazing choir, The Kings Singers, and the photography that accompanies the tour is spectacular.  A delightful treat in history, music and geography that makes for some very pleasant and informative ""armchair travel"".",1473033600,,775,5.134920634920635
