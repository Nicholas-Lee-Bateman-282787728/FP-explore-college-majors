977230,3,6305186561,"""Heat"" is by no means a good film, but it is the best outing from Warhol director Paul Morrissey.

Joe Dallesandro plays basically the same character as in ""Flesh"" and ""Trash"" so his performance is mundane as usual. It's the other characters in the film that make it watchable.

Pat Ast as Joe's landlady and Sylvia Miles as the fading star Sally Todd are the film's saving grace. Both have perfect comic timing and unlike Joe, can actually act. The ""What do you mean, what do I mean, I mean..."" scene is genius!

But the shining star of the this picture is Warhol Factory Superstar ANDREA FELDMAN! A. Because she can't act at all. B. Her voice manages to amuse and annoy all at once. And C. Her improvised one-liners and indicipherable yiddish will crack you up for days!

It is ""Sunset Boulevard"" for Bohemian Junkies. Rent it!",1164499200,2,829,4.581081081081081
977231,3,6305186561,"This is the most coherent in the Flesh/Trash/Heat trilogy and certainly more watchable than Andy Warhol's films that he personally ""directed"" (anyone for 8 hours of the Empire State Building?). John Waters was certainly influenced by Andy Warhol (who returned the favor in Andy Warhol's Bad) but his films were a lot more fun to watch. Though, just as in Andy Warhol, early John Waters had the characters basically play themselves, Pink Flamingoes and Female Trouble are shockingly hilarious, whereas Heat has a creepy sense of exploitation. This update on Sunset Boulevard (a far better movie by far) has the characters repeating what seem like monologues. The storyline revolves around the characters using each other sexually and otherwise and even though the ""acting"" is certainly lacking, the characters seem like real people who lived in the countercultural version of skid row at the time with the explicit scenes verging on pornographic without being at all arousing. The reason I called Heat a ""classic"" is that underground films at the time could be tedious, random images, political diatrebes, or experiments with film (the same shot over and over). This was way before underground films morphed into independent films where with the right connections, you could actually make a profit as well as before the vcr, when seeing an underground movie was an experience in itself. That world has now disappeared and ""Heat"" is a fragment of that time.",1151366400,8,1455,5.143459915611814
977232,1,6305186561,"I hate this movie.

Whoa---

How can I accurately describe a movie of such

""monumental human disgrace"" into digestable words?

Reading what I typed above, I think I just did.

Believe it or not,

I understand what Mr. Warhol was trying to do.

I even get the whole ""Let's-make-fun-of-all-the-has-been-Hollywood-Lana-Turner-esque-bimbos"" out there.

I get it.

But this movie made me sad as hell.  Not just because the script was bad and the acting was bad (what a waste of a beautiful face, Joe Dallesandro!), this movie sincerely felt ""cheap"" to the core.

I suppose I can accept it as it being ""humorous"" somehow but it just wasn't funny to me.  Male bimbos aren't funny and neither are people who go through life using only 1/2% of their brain rather than the typical 10.

You can waste your time watching this sorry movie if you have enough soap in your shower to wash yourself five times afterwards- because that's exactly how I felt after I wasted 2 hours of my life watching an example of a perfectly capable and healthy man trying to climb the ""ladder of success"" by hopelessly wasting away his parent's only gift to him of good genes.",1149292800,,1144,4.688442211055277
977233,4,6305186561,"This is probably the most accessible of the Worhol flicks, and comes across as a seedy voyeuristic experience.  Sylvia Miles is fantastic as a whacked-out, washed-up actress of yesteryear, and her sexually-confused daughter is just as off-kilter.  It's filled with hilariously weird characters and scenes, most noteably the scene where Joe (Dallesandro) and his landlord (Pat Ast) end up caressing each other in bed, in order for him to get ""that discount"" on his rent.  Another stand-out is the discussion between Sylvia and her daughter over the possibility that her grandson will become a lesbian if he is raised by two gay women!  The dialogue seems very natural, and perhaps was largely improvised.  The label ""art-house film"" is appropriate here.  More refined than Worhol's/Morrissey's ""Trash"" and ""Flesh"", this stream-of-consciousness film should satisfy if you enjoy well-done low-budget independent films.",1030060800,,915,5.546762589928058
977234,4,6305186561,"Change the planet, leave New York City and move to Los Angeles. Bring a youngish beautiful man in a nest of women in heat and you could end up with a gigolo who plays the role well but cannot stand the constant rivalry between the mother, the daughter, the motel manager, and a few others, and he has to leave but to go where ? To go back to the motel swimming pool and a mother who arrives with an unloaded gun and commit the crime of shooting someone without any bullet. But it also reveals that women are looking possession and not just pleasure, and they are ready to do anything to have that possession, which a man cannot accept, no matter how greedy he may be. The end shows how castrating these possessive women can be, but without any smoke from the gun, any blood from the blade. Castrating but impotent, and they end up being hysterical and nothing else. California is nothing but heat and does not in anyway bring liberation or pleasure, just lust, greed and possessiveness, which is another word for greed. In other words this film is the total anti-picture of Hollywood :  no gloss, no shine, no stars, no limelights, just hysterics, tears and sunshine. What a life for a man, even one who would like to live off the crop, on the back of the gullible women who need a man as a toy. There is no pleasure in being the toy of a possessive person who does not want to share the toy and prefers ripping it to pieces to sharing it with someone else.

7884421,2,6305186561,"There is really only one reason to watch an Andy Warhol production of a Paul Morrissey film starring Joe Dallesandro--and that is the hope that, somewhere along the way, you are going to see Dallesandro naked. A military brat who ran wild, Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling jobs for ""physique"" magazines before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967. Warhol knew a good thing when he saw it, and for the next several years Dallesandro would appear in one Warhol produced film after another, most of them directed by Paul Morrissey. The trouble is that Warhol was a bad producer, Morrissey was a ho-hum director, and Dallesandro is one of the most wooden actors to grace the screen. But whether he's naked, in a three piece suit, or stomping around in a swim suit--well, he just looks so damn good you can't help but watch his every move.

Released in 1972, HEAT has the barest plot imagineable. Dallesandro is a former child television star who wanders into a cheap motel that includes a swimming pool, a grotesque landlady, a couple of brothers who do a nightclub act in which they have sex, and a nitwit woman who claims to be a lesbian and whose mother (Sylvia Miles) is a fading star. Pretty soon Dallesandro is getting naked with the landlady and ultimately he gets naked with the fading star--but when she becomes too possessive he walks out. Throw in the occasional reference to SUNSET BLVD and that's pretty much it.

The cinematography is dull and so is most of the cast. Miles is loud and shrewish, but she gives the film what little energy it has. Dallesandro, of course, adds his part to the film by looking drop-dead, rough-trade gorgeous. But unless you're hot to see Miles' sagging breasts or Dallesandro's butt and a quick crotch flash, you might want to give HEAT a miss.

7884422,5,6305186561,"I've been in love with this film for at least 20 years.  I've probably seen it a hundred times, but I still watch it on occasion.  The film is wonderfully sleazy and very indicative of the free wheeling attitudes toward sex---- pre-AIDS.

I'm in love with all the characters in the film. I guess everyone has their specific favorite, but mine is Lydia, the motel manager.  She is beyond ugly, and the art directors of the film obviously exploited it and made her appearance part of the plot.  She wears the most unflattering outfits imaginable.  She is a nympho for sure, and walks around the motel fanning herself with a $1 paper fan, while affecting a contrived Southern accent.

This film must be seen to be believed.  In my opinion, this film is awesome.  A true treasure--but especially appealing for us trashy film lovers.",1233964800,2,828,4.694444444444445
