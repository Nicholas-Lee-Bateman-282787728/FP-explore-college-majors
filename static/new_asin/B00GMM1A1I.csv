6086827,5,B00GMM1A1I,"This is the best Shackleton reenactment I've seen yet. I'm a real Shackleton fan and have read about this ill fated expedition extensively. Although these guys had back up and several advantages that Shackleton did not have I think it comes the closesr to replicating his ordeal than any of the other attempts I've seen. The narration leaves a little to be desired, but once you get past that it's a good documentary.

In reality I don't know that anyone will ever duplicate this remarkable feat not only of navigation, which is huge, but of actually surviving a year living on the ice with far less than adequate shelter and provisions. I doubt any of our modern day adventurers will be fool hardy enough to replicate living on the ice for a year on near starvation rations then jump into a 22 foot life boat and row it to Elephant Island only to again embark on a suicide mission of trying to navigate and withstand incredible storms and seas to reach South Georgia Island some 800 miles away. Shackleton pulled off an absolutely incredible feat!

If you are not familiar with the Shackleton epic do yourself a favor and read his book ""South"" or Worsely's book ""Endurance"" before watching this documentary. Get a real feel for what these men endured before watching this, it will give you a much better perspective on what this is all about. In my book Shackleton, Worsley, Crean, and Wild were incredible leaders and  men who pulled off an incredible feat of survival!",1406419200,4,1471,4.6937984496124034
6086828,2,B00GMM1A1I,"I'm not going to lie, I fell asleep about half way through watching this so take this review with a grain of salt. It was a good documentary and explained the history and the trials that Shackleton had gone through very well. It explained the current expedition well too.

My favorite part, though, was seeing Sir Ranulph Fiennes, as he is my favorite Antarctic explorer (and if you're looking for a good read about Antarctic adventure, I would highly recommend his book Mad, Bad & Dangerous to Know: The Autobiography). This documentary just lacked adventure and character for me, which is unfortunate because it is obvious that the expedition did not.

There is nothing really wrong with this documentary, but it should say a lot that I fell asleep during a show on one of my favorite topics and didn't think twice about returning it without rewatching the second half.",1406160000,,871,4.8
6086829,5,B00GMM1A1I,Ernest Shackleton was a very interesting leader of men caught in an impossible situation!  This film was very well done!,1401408000,,120,5.0
6086830,5,B00GMM1A1I,Shackleton one of my Herod.  They did a good job in Chasing Shackleton.  I have been to South Georgia and climbed where he climbed to get to Stromness whaling station.  Thanks,1398384000,,175,4.580645161290323
6086831,3,B00GMM1A1I,"Regardless of how difficult the reenacted voyage was - and there were plenty of tough times - it can't be overstated that the members of the crew had an option to participate and they had back-up.  No one's life hung in the balance if they made it or not.  I admire their grit in taking on the challenge, but they are not nor never will be Ernest Shackleton and the other five men who made it to South Georgia to save the lives of their comrades.  I found the leader downright insufferable by the end.  For someone who has been to South Georgia, I did appreciate seeing places I visited there and places I will never see there.",1396137600,,627,4.288135593220339
6086832,5,B00GMM1A1I,I saw the original Shackleton movie and this one was just as interesting. The parallel between the two was riveting.,1396051200,,116,4.85
6086833,5,B00GMM1A1I,Considering that in the early 1900's Shackleton and his men traveled over 800 miles in a small boat across a remote part of the cold South Atlantic and then endured additional hardships in crossing a remote  uncharted mountainous island ( all in the effort to save the crew of the Endurance) it is hard to believe that anyone in modern times  would desire to re-create this incredible feat. This author and a small group of highly skilled and dedicated adventurers faithfully re-create Shackleton's  journey. This book is a companion to the PBS series of the same name. It is a worthwhile adventure book that is well presented. If you enjoy reading true adventures of seafaring and mountaineering this book will not disappoint. Highly recommended.,1393718400,4,747,5.008064516129032
6086834,3,B00GMM1A1I,"After watching the first episode of this program on PBS, we pre-ordered the video. However, we later wished we'd saved our money. Although the story WAS interesting, there was so much repetitiveness in the video, it became annoying and boring. The same footage and comments were used over and over while we waited impatiently for the ending.",1393286400,4,341,5.0
6086835,3,B00GMM1A1I,"Shackleton's boat voyage from Elephant Island to South Georgia Island to rescue his stranded crew men a desperate voyage by a very brave man.  To reproduce the voyage for a media event is downright silly.  While I appreciated some of the photos, especially of the crossing of South Georgia Island, these men risked bodily harm in what was essentially a publicity stunt.
In some respects, it would be like re-enacting a Civil War battle using live ammunition to see how men managed such suicidal charges.  Courage is showed in actual crises by those living the crisis with which they found themselves faced.  Reproducing such an event would probably seem laughable to those who made such a desperate move only because they had no other choice.",1393200000,3,742,4.912
6086836,5,B00GMM1A1I,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to talk to Sir Ernest Shackleton about the Endurance expedition?  Meet Tim Jarvis.

Tim didn't recreate Shackleton's entire Endurance expedition.  Just the hardest parts - the  800-mile boat journey and crossing of South Georgia.  Until Tim and his worthy team accomplished the double in early 2013, only Shackleton, accompanied by Frank Worsley and Tom Crean, had managed to pull off this amazing feat.

Heres the back story.  In 2007, Alexandra Shackleton approached Tim Jarvis about recreating her grandfathers double.  Since Shackletons 1916 accomplishment, many people had crossed South Georgia but only a handful of attempts had been made at recreating his almost-impossible boat journey.

In 1997, an Irish team was forced to scuttle their boat after capsizing three times.  In 2000, a German crew had to be towed part of the way.  Trevor Potts valiant attempt in 1993-94 with a three-man crew came closest to success.  Ironically where, Shackleton refused to take the risk of being pushed past South Georgia and opted to land on the uninhabited Antarctic-facing shore, Potts was driven by the raging seas to the supposedly friendlier eastern shore.  Potts and his team attempted a reverse crossing of the island - from Stromness to King Haakon Bay - but were forestalled by the treacherous terrain and a shortage of food.

Ive had the pleasure of hearing Tim tell the story of the Shackleton Epic a number of times and am well aware that Tims challenges were almost as great as Sir Ernests.  This is a story that never gets old.  Its a story of man pushed to the limits.  Its a story of remarkable teamwork.  Its a story of doing the impossible.

My heartiest congratulations to Tim on a magnificent achievement, a wonderful book and a fascinating video.

6086850,4,B00GMM1A1I,"As adventures go, this one is pretty extraordinary, the supported party taking great pains to recreate the remarkable journey of Shackleton whose Antarctic voyage capsized his ship and left over 30 of his crew stranded on a remote island, freezing, their lifeboats their only shelter, and no chance of rescue. The only option was for Shackleton to take one of the lifeboats and several of his crew, and attempt to SAIL to the next nearest island, a tiny dot, some 600 miles northeast. If his navigation was off even one tiny bit, everyone was doomed. Add to all this, freezing waters (often ZERO degrees centigrade), waves 15-20 feet high, and a wooden boat not much larger than a dory. This latest attempt was to see if modern man could replay Shackleton's epic journey --building the same type of boat, taking the same type of rations and wearing the same type of clothing. In freezing waters (and by Arctic law, accompanied by a rescue ship), the men battle tight quarters, seasickness, and cold splashing water that kept their lower deck (and them) soaked. Over 3 hours, the film follows their adventure as morale sinks and their success begins to dim. At one point, the rescue ship is forced to come to their aid (Shackleton had no such backup). As amazing and courageous as this adventure was, the film seems to make the modern crew the heroes (and make no mistake, this was indeed a difficult endeavor) and somewhat downplay the incredible feat of Shackleton. Morale, cold, hunger, thirst, fear...all must have tested the leadership of Shackleton, who not only succeeded in making the island, but also in going back and rescuing his entire party. On this current adventure, one has to wonder how the crew got fresh water or went to the bathroom, the boat rocking, sometimes violently, in dangerous waters (once overboard the cold would take you in minutes despite any rescue attempt). Instead, the amazing camera footage shows like a typical documentary, the stubbornness and determination often overriding outside advice (kicking off the doctor's recommendations, for instance). But the film and accomplishment are indeed amazing and well worth a look, the excitement keeping you watching. Crossing the icy seas is not something many or any of us would undertake...but at the end of this film, one has to wonder if any of this was worth much more than to satisfy this group's yearning to be the first (all crew member are well-accomplished in their extreme sports fields). But the true hero here was and stays Shackleton. And even this amazing venture takes nothing away from Shackleton's skill and leadership (he had never taken the helm of a ship, despite being the expedition's leader). My only wish for this film would have been a bit more praise for the risks and daring of Shackleton, something more than simply reading his journal notes. But without this film, one likely wouldn't have recognized the difficulties Shackleton faced...all in all, a film capturing two stories, that of the recreation and that of Shackleton, both amazing to behold.",1416009600,,3060,4.955252918287938
6086851,5,B00GMM1A1I,"This documentary is superb.  I was fortunate to travel on a Spirit of Shackleton tour last January (2014) and we were able to land at both sites on Elephant Island where Shackleton landed.  It was such a wonderful experience and great to see the same landing sites on the documentary.  We were also able to hike on a portion of Shackleton's final travel into Stromness, standing on the same hill where he first sited the whaling station.",1414886400,,437,4.64935064935065

6086853,4,B00GMM1A1I,"Everyone who knows the story of Shakleton, or has read Lansing's excellent book, Endurance, will need to watch this program to answer the question, ""what was it really like?""  To see what Elephant Island looks like or to come over the icy pass and see the whaling station on South Georgia just as Shakleton saw it is worth the price of the DVD. The video does tend to lag in places, and time might have been filled with more technical information about the ""boat journey"" rather that hearing the bleeped out curses of the crew as they bickered.  At the end you will be even more impressed with what Shakelton's men accomplished in 1916 as you see the modern team suffer with ""immersion foot"" and other illnesses while trying to replicate just part of Shakleton's entire journey with the aid of a radio and with a rescue boat and doctors standing by.",1411084800,,849,4.578947368421052

These guys were courageous but they still had a back up plan and some had to abort in order to avoid real harm (foot amputation or maybe death).  The original crew, as depicted in ""Endurance"" seemed to suffer more, with no net in place!

This was more of a broad scope on their attempt to duplicate the greatest survival story.  I was hoping for either another documentary showing the construction and progress of the actual boat, a better description of the clothing worn, more in depth information on the project as a whole.  This was a well done show and the intensity of the group was easily seen; I was just hoping for more.
