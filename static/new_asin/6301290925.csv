Although it is VHS, this collection contains enough great material to keep her happy and at a reasonable price.  I recommend the title for any C 'N D lover.",1320019200,,262,4.117647058823529
323127,5,6301290925,"It's wonderful to see Chip and Dale again. I just would have liked it if there were more than just three shorts! Luckily, the ones that they included is one where they are at odds with Pluto, and another where they are at odds with Donald Duck. Classic!",1246060800,2,253,4.291666666666667
323128,3,6301290925,"I love Disney movies and am trying to start my collection again since I lost many videos as a young child, but one movie that I did purchase was this one and just seeing it made me feel like a kid again.  Being hearing impaired, I would love to turn up the sound to hear the little pitter patters of Chip N'Dale.  Anyone who is a child at heart should get this movie!

7810768,4,6301290925,"I'd like to talk to the merchant who sold the tape personally. I've been trying to find the function on this website on how to contact them personally and I'm not finding it. The video tape works perfectly. However, it is the WRONG tape. I can understand the mix up, as the tape received is Starring Chip 'N' Dale, but it is not the same video as Nuts about Chip 'N' Dale. Both are great videos, but now I own two copies of the identical VHS. Hoping to hear from BJCronk. Thank you",1393977600,,481,4.182795698924731

7810772,5,6301290925,"We are ""NUTS"" about Chip n' Dale and this awesome vhs. If it's DISNEY CHIPMUNKS, we buy it. Disney needs to bring those cute, little, chipper chipmunks, off the pages again, and give them their own TV series. I introduced Chip n' Dale to my daughter when she was a toddler. She's almost 14 now. The chipmunks are, and always have been, her favorite Disney characters.",1344211200,,367,4.575757575757576
