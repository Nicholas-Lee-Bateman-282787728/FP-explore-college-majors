A lot of passion here, you'll shed a tear when you watch it if you love wildlife as I do, and respect those people who are out there researching this kind of thing.  The passion they have and what they do make you cry.  You'll fall in love with the red knot bird, and hope for it.  You'll learn things about the horse shoe crab that you won't believe... do you know they make contact lenses from horse shoe crabs, and that they use their blue blood to help with (do I remember right?) our blood supply?",1415491200,2,587,4.290909090909091
8272003,3,B00195FUAA,"Amazon: Nature: Crash: A Tale of Two Species [The ""Red Knot"" shorebird and the invertebrate Horseshoe ""Crab""] 52 minute color DVD; Distributed by Questar, Inc.  2008

A teacher can excerpt and set this story in a better science context. When two species are in a complex biological relationship, this can be mutually beneficial (mutualism), benefit one but not benefit or harm the other (commensalism), or benefit one and harm the other (parasitism and predation).  This storyline suggests that both benefit from the bird-invertebrate relationship but the supposedly threatened one is the Red Knot; the horseshoe crab would likely increase without the egg predation by the birds.

Also unmentioned is that there are other Limulus (horseshoe crab) species in the Pacific. The avoidance of any scientific names or other science is unfortunately a hallmark of the more recent Nature Series. In this program, this is particularly egregious since there are many subspecies of this bird; others are distributed elsewhere in the world and feed on other invertebrates, not fitting this story. In addition, the species has not been found to merit listing on the IUCN red list. However, aside from the lack of biological overview and depth, this video is fairly free of non-science nonsense except for a brief comment on the birds beginning their migration ""as if by magic."" For the teacher who wishes to excerpt this for class, the following summary is provided with time stamps in brackets. There is a tempo to the film, switching back-and-forth between the bird and the invertebrate at each time stamp below. The narrator is also the filmmaker Allison Argo.

Introduction to the ""horseshoe crab"" life history includes that it is more related to spiders than to true crabs. As usual in recent Nature programs, there is no classification information or use of more accurate science terminology. This species is the eastern seaboard species. It ""sheds shells"" (molts) and has ""blue blood"" (hemolymph). Its coming to shore to breed is synchronous with the arrival of the little Red Knots. [6 min.] This bird eats mussels for its 3 months in Chile before migrating to North America. Ornithologists document a 70 percent drop in population and collect birds by mist net. They speculate on possible extinction while collecting data and banding birds. The birds then migrate to the Arctic after feeding on the horseshoe crab eggs. [14] The horseshoe crabs move according to the lunar cycles/tides. By the time they are 9-10 years old, they can lay eggs. Collection of these ""crabs"" has switched in this state from bait for fishing for eels and conches to collection for 4 medical companies. Shows ""bleeding"" of the crabs for last 30 years after this fluid was discovered to have a clotting agent that responds rapidly to bacteria; the prior test for bacteria utilized the inflammatory response of rabbits.  Explains that the blue color is due to copper being the oxygen carrier instead of iron as in hemoglobin. This drained blue ""blood"" is valued at $15,000/quart and the medical company extraction process is shown. 300,000 are used a year and then returned to the sea after ""bleeding""; mortality rate is about 13 percent. [21] Horseshoe ""crab"" spawning is shown in the Delaware Bay, followed by massive feeding on eggs by the Red Knots.  Good views of the external fertilization mate clustering but not the fertilization process itself. [25] The Red Knot survey shows the two weeks of feeding on the eggs are critical for adding body mass to these birds before the migration to the Arctic.  In the last decade, there has been a 75 percent decline in the horseshoe ""crab"" population but this is not clearly attributed to any cause although fishing is alluded. Mark-recapture is used to estimate the population and tagging is shown. [29] Of the approximately 80,000 eggs the older females lay, about ten probably survive. Video of the larvae developing inside the eggs with four molts before hatching. [32] Cannon netting is used to capture the Red Knots. [36] Horseshoe ""crab"" eggs hatch and larvae swim. Counts are done in nighttime. Concerns of fishermen are expressed. University of Delaware researchers search for artificial foods to replace ""crabs"" as bait for fishermen. Housing development along coasts also heavily displaces habitat. [45] Some Red Knots are too skinny to migrate. Winds and the moon signal the birds to migrate and the flock disperses as it enters Arctic Circle. Researchers are completely missing the birds in the Arctic; none found in Cambridge Bay. They worriedly await the future count in Tierra del Fuego (tip of South America). [51] By September in Delaware Bay, the ""crabs"" are burrowing in the ocean floor. Video ends by [53] on a teary-eyed note of doom. Since this video was made, the 2-year ban on fishing for horseshoe crabs was overturned by a court.

8272004,5,B00195FUAA,"I had been looking for this video as part of a educational program. I used to borrow it from my local library, but all local copies were damaged. I was able to purchase this for a fair price and get it in time for the program.",1378684800,,226,3.9347826086956523
8272005,5,B00195FUAA,"This film is a much-needed wakeup call on many levels. It's not just about the birds (Red Knots), but more about the crash in the Horseshoe Crab population and what that means for us humans. As someone in the medical field, the crash in Horseshoe Crabs is disturbing because every injectable vaccine and medication is first tested for bacterial contamination with an extract of the crabs' blood. It's the only reliable test we have for this kind of bacterial contamination...if we lose the Horseshoe Crabs (and they are in serious decline) we lose the ability to test reliably for bacterial contamination of our injectable drugs.

The film is well-made - the ""web"" of Red Knot / Horseshoe Crab / Humans is well thought out and well-presented. By the time it's over, you will truly understand why scientists are so concerned about the decline in Red Knot and Horseshoe Crab populations. The film is also beautifully photographed and narrated. It doesn't focus on doom-and-gloom, but does give a frank and honest view of what is happening and why we should take action.",1297382400,5,1067,4.895027624309392
8272006,4,B00195FUAA,"I think there's a clich'e that says, ""When a butterfly flaps its wings here, a thunderstorm starts in China.""  This documentary marvels at how a South American bird depends upon horseshoe crab eggs in the Carolinas.  If you like ideas about interconnections and dependency, then you will enjoy this.
I guess I could mention the allegory of the cave while I'm at it.  Fishers were innocently using female horseshoe crabs as bait for eels.  Unfortunately, this has caused a South American bird to face extinction.
Sometimes it's hard to watch green documentaries because they are so sad and doomsday-ish.  However, this one wasn't, TO AN EXTENT.  Once leaders learned of the birds demise, they banned or limited fishers' use of horsecrabs and it seems that the fishers have complied.  This is so different from companies that don't want to lower global warming.  This is different from car companies that don't want to make their products fuel-efficient.  I recently saw a documentary about the Everglades and it suggested that Floridians want green lawns much more than they want to see alligators and manatees survive.  I am glad that no humans seem to be putting effort into seeing this South American bird die.
Having said that, this documentary does reach a sad conclusion.  I can't call this a feel-good work.  This may make you bitter and say, ""Well, why try to stop a tragedy if it's too late?!""
The work fascinated me in how it revealed how individuals can know sooo much about critters.  Fishers could just look at a crab and tell its gender whereas I didn't see breasts or long hair, so I didn't think female.  A scientist could describe harmed body parts of the bird just by knowing its weight.
I was always taught that sociobiology was a bad thing.  But I felt good when I heard that more than one male horseshoe crab can breed with just one female.  Think of all the male animals that fight other males to get busy, human males included!  With this crab, everyone can go home happy!
The work marvels at how two animals thousands of miles apart could co-exist.  This didn't surprise me as the relationship developed over eons.  Perhaps the first migratory bird happened to eat some crab eggs, liked it, and poof!, history was made.",1245110400,2,2242,4.761658031088083
