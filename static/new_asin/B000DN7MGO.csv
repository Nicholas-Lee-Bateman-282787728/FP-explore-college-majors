2475353,4,B000DN7MGO,"Good remake. I think what's remarkable about this version is that it was done LIVE twice on the same day (once each for the West Coast & East Coast). What really would have been COOL, Attention WARNER BROS HOME VIDEO, is if BOTH perforamnces would have been put on the DVD. In fact, I would have gladly paid more for a 2 DVD set containing BOTH performances. Warners, please reissue this DVD, and include BOTH performances of Failsafe. Thank you. P.S. Failsafe made it to T.V. in 2000, months before 9/11. Had the airing been scheduled after 9/11, it never would have made it to T.V.  The dialog regarding New York would have been deemed way to harsh, and I would have agreed with this.",1221955200,9,686,4.488
2475354,1,B000DN7MGO,"As a huge fan of the original film this remake was going to have a hard time impressing me anyway, but this production was dull and almost unwatchable. The 'live TV' attempt adds nothing and it fact makes you appreciate the value of editing in films because unintentionally the actors step on each others lines, and background stage noise is evident in the film.

I appreciate that they stayed true to the original story which was terrifying and gripping but the biggest diappontment are the scenes between the President and his translator. Done by Henry Fonda (and a suprisingly good) Larry Hagman in the original film, the dialogue between these two men is the high point of the film for me. But in this version with Richard Dryfuss and Noah Wiley, the scenes are totally 'flat' and undramatic.

Bought this for $5 in a bargain bin so I have no complaints but as a film and remake of a classic this was a waste of time.",1215561600,5,921,4.542168674698795
2475355,2,B000DN7MGO,"This adaptation of Fail Safe is disappointing. With a terrific story and a number of very fine cast members, it's hard to know why this has fallen flat on its face. Perhaps it was due to the live television format in which it was broadcast in 2000 (not really done since the late 50's and early 60's.)

Perhaps one problem is the tendency to compare it to the 1964 film with Henry Fonda, Dan O'Herlihy, Walter Matthau, Frank Overton, Larry Hagman and others, all of whom did an excellent job.

In this version, for example, I had trouble imagining Richard Dreyfuss (the President) in anything other than one of his comedic roles. Brian Dennehy as General Bogan you would think would be a stand out but you hardly notice him there. Harvel Keitel, one of my very favorite actors, seems wooden and bored as he delivers his lines.

One thing I liked about this presentation was a small twist they add regarding a last minute communication to the bomber pilot (George Clooney) from his family.

The story itself needs no exposition here. It is a riveting story set during the cold war. I read the book in junior high and first saw the 1964 version a couple of years before reading the book. The movie is as powerful for me now as it was when I saw it more than 40 years ago.

I give Clooney (the producer) credit for trying to revive an old style live television drama. I think it was a good idea to try. This production just has no fizz.

Still, if you are a fan of the story itself I would recommend you see it. If you've not seen the 1964 movie yet, see this TV version first.",1208649600,6,1574,4.354948805460751
2475356,5,B000DN7MGO,"Clooney, here and in Good Night and Good Luck, analyses after September 11 certain assumptions about what Americans are, in living black and white. The premise of the original movie and book, that an American president would make the sacrificial decision in Fail-Safe is unbelievable today but it was believable under JFK and even Eisenhower. Richard Dreyfuss' Jewish presence makes it so.

Harvey Keitel is just perfect as Blackie.

I did miss one thing. Blackie, in the original movie and in the book, has a recurring dream of a matador which is resolved at the finish: but for the same reason the directors of the new teleplay didn't dare show a girl dancing in Spanish Harlem to show what was sacrificed in an America trying not so damnably hard to deny its Afro-Carib roots, today's audiences would have been mystified by ""the matador: I!""",1190160000,,844,4.854166666666667
2475357,3,B000DN7MGO,"When I ordered this DVD I expected a movie production.  I don't know where I got that impression but when I watched the opening credits I remember feeling disappointed, cheated almost to the point of stopping the DVD. I am glad I didn't.  It took a few minutes for me to adjust to the medium in which I was experiencing art.  I am old enough to remember Studio 90, Hallmark Hall of Fame or even life productions of Howdy Doody and situation comedies.  This DVD put me back in an art form that does not exist anymore and I miss it.  I have read the book and now experienced the live television production.

2475358,4,B000DN7MGO,The DVD for this version of Fail Safe is actually in the widescreen format.  The package says it is in a matted widescreen format and I measured the aspect ratio at about 1.67:1.  Unfortunately the DVD was not anamorphic (not enhanced for widescreen televisions).  At this point in time Warner Brothers should have made this disc anamorphic.  Other than that the movie and disc were fine.,1182816000,3,388,4.833333333333333
2475359,5,B000DN7MGO,"As someone who grew up in the shadow of the Cold War, this movie has always intrigued me.  A truly scary premise especially now that the machines have taken over (sorry, that's a Cyberdyne joke).

  This made-for-TV remake was broadcast live in 2000 and I was most impressed.  I am a technical flaw-spotting fiend and I only spotted one glitch - I'll let you find it.

  The plot is already explained so I'll address the cast - well chosen, and the production values - top-notch.  Live TV is most unforgiving and this was pulled-off in good fashion.

  Sadly this scenario has been supplanted by terrorism but nevertheless, for those who recall the truly excellent 1964 version, this modern take still manages to grip you with suspense.  Once I finish this review I am ordering a copy.  You should do the same.",1182729600,30,810,4.652482269503546
2475360,5,B000DN7MGO,"Stephen Frears takes us deep into the past to address a problem we live today with extreme intensity : the possibility of a nuclear war. He goes back to the Cold War to envisage the situation of such a nuclear conflict between two countries who have the same technological and technical possibilities : the capability to destroy a whole city with two bombs, the capability to get the bombs there no matter what and the protocole for the pilots never to come back once the order is given. This kamikaze situation created by our own protocoles is absurd and demonstrated as such : if a technical mistake causes this situation there is absolutely no way to stop it, what's more to reverse it. It also raises the question of why and how we - the civilized West - have invented such protocoles that transform our pilots into suicide-bombers, and also how and why human beings can accept such protocoles that transform them into non-thinking machines. The film shows that there is absolutely no escape from nuclear destruction when it is started. It also shows that some supposedly technical or learned minds are using the logic of a traditional war within the frame of nucelar warfare, which is absurd because there cannot be any victor in such a war. The film very clearly shows that the point is to avoid the full confrontation and that this can only be achieved by accepting as much damage on the side responsible for the alert as this side will have caused on the other side. New York to pay off Moscow. This film is also interesting to show how perverse such power, the power to start such a war, is : it transforms human beings into monsters that will remain human if they can avoid the full destruction of the planet by accepting a limited destruction of a few cities. What an achievement indeed. From human being to human monster, from peace and love to let's kill just enough people to guarantee that all will not be killed. War seen as a blood sucker sucking just the right amount of blood for you not to die of apoplexy. Absurd and yet so human indeed : the human race is the only animal race that has invented and uses the logic of absurdity.

Brian Dennehy was very good but Richard Dryfus was miscast in the role of the President (and I generally enjoy Dryfus' performances.) It followed the original very closely, so you don't get to compare storylines very much, just the character performances. In this case, the original does a far better job of getting the story across, the acting was better. Certain actors were just wasted in their roles, George Clooney and Don Cheadle as examples. My recommendation? See the original. You must also cast your mind back to the late '50's and early '60's when many of us were living in fear of such possibilities, totally beyond our control.",1425427200,,780,4.8283582089552235

Except for a very few words this live performance was the exact same dialog as the original. I would rate the original movie as five stars, but this version got only one due to the terrible acting. There was little or no emotion displayed. My seven-year old grandson can read a book with more emotion then was shown by the actors in this remake. It was painful to watch such great actors display so little emotion when reading their lines. Sam Elliot gave the best performance. Brian Dennehy was dead in his portrayal of General Bogan. Even Richard Dreyfuss as the President gave a deadpan performance. He is certainly no Henry Fonda. Don't waste your money on this DVD.

2475393,5,B000DN7MGO,"The era of live television drama (other than awards shows and sporting events) is a relic of the previous century.  What was once standard procedure during the 1950's went the way of the dodo bird when recording technology improved.  In Spring 2000, CBS decided to harken back to those fondly remembered earlier days with a remake, performed completely live, of the epic Cold War thriller, ""Fail Safe"".

  ""Fail Safe"" was an early 60's novel about a horrific error of miscommunication from Strategic Air Command (SAC) that sends a bomber wing on its way to bomb the Soviet Union.  It was made into a 1964 film starring such acting heavyweights as Henry Fonda, Walter Mathau and Larry Hagman.  (Note:  the book also served as the inspiration for the better known black comedy, ""Dr. Strangelove"").  In 2000, CBS threw together another heavyweight cast.  This group included George Clooney (as the very start of his Hollywood kingpin status), Richard Dreyfuss, James Cromwell, Harvey Keitel and Sam Elliott.  It was even introduced by legendary newsman, Walter Cronkite.

  The broadcast was filmed in black and white, to recall that bygone era.  To facilitate the live broadcast, the producers also built in script and set-design 'fail safes' to keep the narrative flowing if one of the cast members jumped ahead by mistake.  The end result was a very compelling Cold War tale that would please fans well-versed in the genre as well as hold the interest of newcomers.  (Note:  a few months later, CBS took another stab at live television with a remake of ""On Golden Pond"".  It was not as warmly received and CBS ended its attempt at the live television renaissance).

  It took many years before the DVD of this version of ""Fail Safe"" was made available in the United States (it was available almost right away overseas).  Still, it was worth the wait to add it to my collection.  I recommend other fans of the literature and productions of this era to add it their own libraries.",1412985600,5,1978,4.8532934131736525

It is not a more modern take on the theme of accidental war -- the plot here is exactly the same as the original Cold War version, and this one is set in the Cold War. They even shot it in black-and-white I guess to simulate the original, which made no sense to me.  Much of the script is word-for-word the same as the original and the few differences are trivial and add nothing -- as though the scriptwriters felt compelled to do something ""original"" but failed at it.  Personally I thought that the acting and all besides of the original were far superior to this one.

This is a fine cautionary tale that of course never explains how the ""go code"" was accidentally issued -- this was a glaring fault in both the original and this version, although ""Dr. Strangelove"" does explain this in that version of an ""accidental war"" scenario.

2475484,5,B000DN7MGO,"Having been a fan of the original 1964 movie, I was a little leery of this production but decided to order it anyway.  Good decision!  In many ways, it is even better than the original film.  Shot in black and white, it is a real throw back to the early days of live television productions.  I found it very riveting.  The dialogue and plot are the same as the movie for the most part.  This particular production was televised in 2000, a full year before 911.  The story is still set in the 1960's and holds even after all this time.  I would urge anyone to give this production a viewing.  Very thought provoking.",1324944000,,615,4.324561403508772

I am always going to go back to the original FailSafe starring Henry Fonda but the re-make is more than good and Clooney and Dreyfus shine, the story is again in black and white and pretty much holds to the original film.  If you liked the original FailSafe then you will like this re-make.",1316304000,2,368,4.575757575757576
2475486,4,B000DN7MGO,"Considering this was done on live TV, the show was done very well.  Very close to the original with Henry Fonda (one of my favorite cold-war films) with some minor changes and additions.  Doing it in black-and-white just added to the aura of the 60's.

2475488,3,B000DN7MGO,"George Clooney produced and directed this remake of the 1964 chiller ""Fail-Safe"" for live TV on CBS in 2000. The occasion was special insofar as there hadn't been a live dramatic production on any network in some years. Clooney played one of the leading characters and Richard Dreyfuss played the president, subbing for the monumental Henry Fonda who did so well in the 1964 version.

If you've never seen ""Fail-Safe"", it's a Cold war hydrogen bomb nightmare from a book of the same name. An electronic communications system goes awry and sends a nuclear-armed bomber crew at its ""fail safe"" point on the perimeter of the USSR into the nation with instructions to bomb Moscow. The drama revolves around efforts to recall the bomber and, when that cannot be done, the negotiations that go on with the Soviet Union on what retribution will be taken at home to avoid nuclear war if the bomber fulfills its mission.

The original film was 100 minutes of sheer tension and fright. It arrived on the big screen almost simultaneously with another Cold war nuclear nightmare, ""Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Strangelove-or-How-I-Learned-to-Stop-Worrying-and-Love-the-Bomb-Special-Edition/dp/B000055Y0X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;-- Stanley Kubrick's very similar black comedy. The two films have become blood brothers as the first Cold war era movies about nuclear destruction; both were dreamed up moments after the 1962 Cuban missile criis occurred, the moment in the 20th century when superpowers USA and USSR came the closest to nuclear war, and released months apart in 1964.

Unfortunately, Clooney's remake is a tame and limp retelling of both the book and its foil, the 1964 movie. None of the actors in the remake are as good or believeable as those in the 1964 cast that featured Fonda, Walter Matthau, Frank Overton, Fritz Weaver and Larry Hagman, who grew to fame as J.R. Ewing in television's ""Dallas."" The aura of tension, fear, foreboding and inevitability that permeates the 1964 original is missing in the remake. Also, true to the foibles of live television (I watched this when it aired in 2000), the production started 7 minutes late and ended 11 minutes early, forcing CBS and the film's producers to scramble to fill time on the little screen.

If you have no exposure to the movie, my recommendation is to skip this version of ""Fail Safe"" and watch the 1964 film instead&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fail-safe-Special-Edition/dp/B00004XPPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fail-safe (Special Edition)</a>. The older one is a classic while the newer one is a lukewarm piece of television milquetoast. I give George Clooney marks for trying to reinvent a masterpiece in modern garb. Unfortunately, it doesn't carry the weight or authenticity of the original, a common problem of remakes.",1256688000,3,3054,5.547210300429184
2475489,5,B000DN7MGO,"Recreates the look and feel of live B&W television, back in the day, beautifully. As if there was a extra high quality episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents produced live in 1960. But in fact, it actually is live television. Which made it all the more impressive and interesting to me. I watched it live years ago and enjoyed it even more this time, without all the commercials. The atmosphere has a certain tension which I found to be fascinating. Bare in mind that this is nothing like a movie. It's like a stage play, but spread out over a large television studio with several separate sets. Nobody gets 19 takes to get it down perfectly. The overall effect will appeal to serious drama fans in particular I think. I can't stop myself from giving it one extra star for sheer originality. Fine performances, dialog, and pace. A unique and entertaining film. I don't know of anything else remotely like it.",1252800000,6,906,4.66875
2475490,3,B000DN7MGO,"Machines fail: a computer system is at fault
for a cold war era near WWII incident.
The acting here is first rate: it is the script from the book that is dated.
My biggest fault of the movie is the rationality of the leaders
and generals.
The problems of nuclear over-kill and the possibility of not only massive radio active contamination, but a nuclear winter leaving the end result of such a war as a dead planet Earth has to be passed on to the next generation, but in the past rationality in the leadership has been the exception and not the rule. After 8 years of Bush we are glad he was never given this option?
Banning all nuclear weapons research in the USA certainly hasn't done any good: it has let smaller countries catch up and be less afraid of the bomb.
I liked the movie, but think a more modern approach
would have been more educational than a more than 20 year old plot.",1246492800,,888,4.323353293413174
