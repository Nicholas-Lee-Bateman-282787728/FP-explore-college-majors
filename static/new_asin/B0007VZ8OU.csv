8052389,5,B0007VZ8OU,"George London was the great American bass baritone who sung Boris Gudunov (in English) in Moscow in the early 1960's.  This wonderful documentary of his commemorative concert included valuable excerpts of his performances of, inter alia, Don Giovanni, Faust, Boris Gudunov.
The Concert itself was held in Germany (Munich) in the mid-1980's. Lined up in the Concert are all the eminent singers of the day then active in Europe, particularly in West Germany: Lucia Popp, Leonie Rysanek, Edita Gruberova, Tatyana Troyanos, Thomas Moser, Simon Estes, Francisco Araiza, Catherine Malfitano, Nicolai Gedda, etc.
If you want me to crown one single performance from the entire illustrious lot, I would say it is Nicolai Gedda, who, already in his early 60's (or late 50's), sang Cavarodossi's aria from Tosca 'E lucevan le stelle' with great emotional committment and vocal grandeur.
We must not forget that Gedda is not a spinto tenor or dramatic tenor, yet his ability to bring forth this piece is phenonmenal. Each phrase, each word, carries a special meaning and the entire aria is a short but intense emotional reprisal of Cavaradossi's feelings before execution.
Lucia Popp is always great in Mozart, and her Strauss is also wonderful.  Malfitano and Gruberova showcased their respective technical prowess in arias from Offenbach's Le Contes d'Hoffmann.  Simon Estes demonstrated his great voice in Verdi's Mcbeth excerpt. While James King and Leonie Rysanek gave a great Wagnerian account of Die Walkure, Thomas Moser's Steersman in Der fliegende Hollander is less refined.  However, singing in Russian from Tchaikovskys' Eugene Onegin, Francisco Araiza was fully capable of bringing out the pathos and lyricism of Lensky.
The Concert is certainly a significant event, and this DVD brings in all the wonderful aspects of the important occasion, as well as the stature of George London as an eminent and important singer in the mid-20th century.",1372032000,,1943,5.298701298701299
8052390,5,B0007VZ8OU,"The special talent of George London was celebrated twice before his demise. This one was glorious for many reasons. At the onset it was sad to note that participants featured in this gala were themselves gone from us, Troyanos, Popp, Moffo and Rysanek. How wonderful it was to hear their greatness while in their prime giving moving and definitive performances. For those still with us, their performances on this DVD clearly displayed the talent for which they have become noted for. Edita Gruberova was sparkling as Olympia in Tales of Hoffman. Catherine Malfitano gave a special rendtion of Antonia's area from the same opera. The trio of Catherine Malfitano, Simon Estes, and Margarete Hintermeier from the Tales of Hoffman was rich with the passion these artists were famous for. Lucia Popp and Sona Ghazarian displayed the great beauty of Richard Strauss' Arabella. Simon Estes was powerful in the role of Macbeth, his distinct richness of voice so well displayed. Thomas Moser was delightful as the Steersman's of Wagner Fliegende Hollander. It was, in my opinion, strange that Francisco Araiza sang Lenski' area from Onegin while Nicolai Gedda performed the Tosca aria. Their performances lacked real enthusiasm. Was it because they were singing something other than their signature pieces? The performance that was electric even before a word was sung, was the finale of Die Walkure with Leonie Rysanek and James King. The intensity was palpable. The audience knew beforehand what was to come and the ovation following was the recognition of a superb rendition of this emotional duet. The icing on the cake was the five pieces of historical clips of George London in his prime and one of the best was with Anna Moffo from Don Giovanni. The Boris Godunov piece was surprisingly effective in English simply because George London was singing it. A wondrous gala indeed.",1269907200,2,1875,5.090909090909091
8052391,4,B0007VZ8OU,"This is one of those ""All-Star Game"" concerts presented as a salute to bass-baritone George London.

It presents five excerpts or vignettes of great performances by London.  The two that are most striking are a duet with Anna Moffo in Mozart's ""La ci darem la mano"" from Don Giovanni, and a stunning Englsh version of the final scene from Boris Godunov.

There is a veritable planetarium of stars on hand for the tribute, and many of their performances bring down the house.  All were good to excellent, the best being:

Edita Gruberova singing ""Les oiseaux dans la charmille""  You could use this short piece by itself to show friends what truly great singing and voice control is all about.  Gruberova can sing with the best ever!

Lucia Popp and Sona Ghazarian sing a duet from Arabella, and it shows Richard Strauss at his best--showing off beautiful soprano voices.

The final number is from Die Walkure, with James King, and Leonie Rysanek singing Siegmund and Sieglinde.  You can feel the electricity and the connection between these two.  Though it is a concert, uncostumed performance, they are so ""real"" and involved that you feel you've just experienced one of the best images of Die Walkure.

Great performance for showing off great singers to your friends.
(I'd have given it 5 stars, but the picture quality was not as crisp as I'd have liked--perhaps the technology of the 80s.  Still glad I bought it--the singing is superb!)",1212796800,3,1440,4.852459016393443
8052392,3,B0007VZ8OU,"Leonie Rysanek a marqu l'opra de ses interprtations hyper-passionnes. Beaucoup moins clbre que Callas en France ou en Italie, elle rayonna surtout en Allemagne et en Amrique. Vraie ""bte de scne"" elle sut adapter sa voix  sa carrire et rgner pendant un demi-sicle dans le coeur des lyricomanes. C'est avec George London qu'elle enregistra une fameux ""Fliegende Hollnder"" qui reste une rfrence dans le domaine wagnrien. Ce DVD est donc indispensable pour tous ceux qui ont connu, ou qui veulent connatre cette poque bnie...",1191974400,2,521,5.2023809523809526
