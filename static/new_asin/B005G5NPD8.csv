4688974,4,B005G5NPD8,"I am a child of the 70's and 80's. When these made-for-tv Captain America movies came out it was wonderful. As a comic fan, I was upset that they rewrote the origin but between the two movies they got the costuming right with a little twist that was kind of need and made sense. I searched for years when I got older to try to find them and finally did on VHS. I was frustrated that I could not transfer them to DVD as they were copy protected. When I saw that they were finally being released in this format I was ecstatic!!

As for the DVD's themselves, they aren't of the best quality. Don't expect a cleaned up copy and definitely not HD! They look like someone did what I wanted to do and just transferred the VHS copies to DVD, however, to have them in this format, I can accept that. It would be nice if someone could get the original source material and clean it up to at least good DVD quality but I'll take what I can get for now. The stories are simple yet engaging and Reb Brown REALLY has the look of the comic book Captain America!! Some will call this a really hokie movie and maybe it is, but if you are a Cap fan, I think you will like it anyway.",1322265600,2,1163,4.078602620087336
4688975,4,B005G5NPD8,"This is a review of the recently released Captain America/Captain America II:  Death Too Soon DVD.  The movies starred Reb Brown as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Len Birman as Dr. Simon Mills.

I grew up watching these films when they first aired on television in the late '70's.  I had a great time watching them then and I had a great time watching them again this past week after I purchased this DVD.

Are the films perfect?  No, not at all.  But if you watch the films for what they're intended to be, notably a fun campy romp a la the 60's Batman series, I think you'll enjoy them more than if you watch them in a serious manner.

I was also pleased to see that the films are included in their entirety.  They're not chopped up like they were when Syfy broadcast them last summer before Captain America:  The First Avenger premiered in theaters.

On to the review of the disc itself.  Equipment used to watch this DVD was a Sony HDTV, Sony 3D Blu-Ray Player and Sony 6.1 home theater surround sound.

I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the presentation.  The films looked pretty good for material that was shot for television over 30 years ago.  I did find myself wishing that some extra work could have been done to make them even more colorful.

The sound left a lot to be desired in my opinion.  I wish the audio on these two movies could have been released in better fidelity (5.1 sound, as they were broadcast on Syfy last summer).  As it is, the films are presented in a 2.0 soundtrack which I think is ok but it's nothing special.

When you take into consideration the amount of dubbed in sounds such as Captain America's motorcycle, explosions & gunfire, etc. it would have enhanced the viewing experience significantly had more work been done for this DVD.  It's too bad that Shout! didn't deem the extra effort as being necessary.

I am docking this release 1 star because this disc is just a bare-bones release.  I feel that Shout! really dropped the ball with this by not including any interviews with Reb Brown or any other stars who were in these films.  If they could include cast interviews for their Street Hawk release, they surely could have done so with this release too.  As it is, all you get are the two films and that's it.

If you enjoyed seeing these films growing up in the '70's, then yes I would add this to your collection.  It's not a perfect release by a long shot but it is a great way to relive some fond childhood memories.",1319414400,41,2477,4.4368070953436805
4688976,2,B005G5NPD8,"I'm going to bring up something that I feel should have been brought up a long time ago.  The two 1970's made for tv ""Captain America"" movies for CBS (and I put those in quotes for a reason), were really just the producers' excuse to cash in on ""The Six Million Dollar Man!""

As you might have read by the other reviews, these two ""Cap"" movies bore little resemblance to the Joe Simon/Jack Kirby comic of the 1940's, or even to the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby revival of the 1960's.

There's no Bucky Barnes, no Professor Erskine or Reinstein, no Red Skull, no Nazis, no Peggy or Sharon Carter, no SHIELD, Nick Fury, etc., etc., etc.

As for Steve Rogers, this version of him isn't so eager to serve his country after being rejected as 4-F (though, to be fair, in this version, he is an ex-marine.)

What you will get is Len Birman as ""Dr. Simon Mills"" who's keeping ""the original Captain America's"" super steroid and injecting it into reluctant ""Steve Rogers"" (Reb Brown) after a fatal accident (well, attempted murder made to look like an accident) in order to save his life.  Afterward, Mr. Rogers becomes a secret agent directly under Dr. Mills.

These two exhibit a father-son/older brother-younger brother type of relationship suspiciously similar to Richard Anderson's ""Oscar Goldman"" and Lee Major's ""Steve Austin.""

While ""Steve Rogers"" is on the operating table, there's even a shot of the doctors and their patient that's extremely similar to the opening credits to ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" (with those over head lights!) and after the injections, ""Steve"" even muses how, with his new found strength, if he holds something too tight, it will break (Lee Majors says the exact same dialogue, practically line for line, in the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" pilot episode ""Cyborg."")

Most telling is the sound effects.  Whenever Reb Brown does something ""super"", we hear that electronic sound of his muscles that sounds just like when Lee Majors jumps, runs, or bends steel!

Perhaps the tv execs were thinking along the same ""follow what's selling"" formulaic lines that Kenneth Johnson thought when he ""developed"" ""The Incredible Hulk"" for CBS (he wasn't behind ""Captain America"", but he did make ""Dr. Banner"" and ""The Hulk"" more like the 1960's tv portrayal of ""The Fugitive""...even renaming ""Bruce Banner"" as ""David"", like the actor who portrayed ""Dr. Richard Kimble"", David Janssen.)

The show is worth getting...if you grew up in the 1970's, and you want the two movies for purely nostalgic purposes.  After all, I bought it for that reason alone.)

But if you didn't, and you expect to see something similar to the recent ""Captain America:  The First Avenger"" movie, or even similar to the 1990 ""Captain America"" movie, you might be either disappointed, or even find yourself scratching your head and going, ""What the hell?!""",1317513600,4,2829,4.913865546218488
4688977,4,B005G5NPD8,"For all of you being so overcritical of this 70's version of Captain America, just get over it. Watch it for what it is. It is easy enough to look back 35 years at a show through the eyes of someone in 2011. I enjoyed it back then as a kid and it is enjoyable now. Just like with the 70's Spider-Man, Incredible Hulk and Wonder Woman, they are all dated but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy them thoroughly. I won't disagree that Reb is not a great actor but you know that is the same criticism many have leveled at Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher for the original Star Wars trilogy for years. So either you just sit back and enjoy it, flaws and all or just be miserable. I for one am happy that it is coming out on DVD, now if we can just get the Nicholas Hammond Spider-Man series out on DVD.",1317427200,29,793,4.057324840764331
4688978,4,B005G5NPD8,"For what it's worth these two tv movies aren't that bad.  I think that have a charm that goes along with low budget fare. Seeing that these were produced in 1979, you can't blame the producers from shying away from super villians. This was a set of pilots set to introduce Captain America into a TV series.  While it's no Incredible Hulk or Spider-Man, it's a good show. If you consider all the bad movies and TV shows out there, it's ok for an afternoon.  I only wish it were written better and the lead actor, Reb Brown, had an acting coach on the set.",1314835200,2,554,4.257142857142857
4688979,5,B005G5NPD8,"I remember watching this (and the first Captain America movie) on CBS in the late 1970s.  I thought it was the coolest thing.  Reb Brown looked like Captain America should look.  I had a chance to watch both movies again over the summer on the SyFy Channel and still enjoyed them.  Yes, Reb Brown can be wooden at times, but I totally buy him as Captain America.  It's good fun!  Don't take it so seriously and you'll enjoy it!",1314748800,25,427,4.341772151898734
4688980,1,B005G5NPD8,"Of all the major superheroes, Captain America has been the unluckiest -- it took SEVENTY YEARS for a decent movie about him to be made.

So what were the NON-decent movies that were made along the way? ""Captain America / Captain America II: Death Too Soon"" is a pretty good example -- not only does it throw out all the original comic book backstory, but it ends up being cheesy, action-deficient and boring. Way too boring to be campy.

In ""Captain America,"" ex-Marine Steve Rogers (Reb Brown) is toodling around California in his nondescript van, not really doing anything. But then an old friend is murdered, and for some reason the bad guys also decide to attack Steve because they think he knows the location of secret classified film.

The only way to save his life is to inject him with FLAG, an experimental super-drug that Steve's father created so he could become a superhero.  This is the point where all Captain America fans go cross-eyed.  So after being bribed with superhero gear (like a rocket-powered motorcycle) Steve reluctantly becomes Captain America, and helps hunt down the evil men who are planning to nuke an American city.

Then in ""Captain America II: Death Too Soon,"" Steve is sent out to investigate a missing scientist who had some kind of aging compound stolen by famous terrorist Miguel (Christopher Lee). It leads him to a small town that immediately tries to get him to get lost, apparently because they were told to act as suspiciously as possible.

""Captain America"" and ""Captain America II: Death Too Soon"" are, hands down, the dullest superhero movies I have ever seen in my life. Not only do they toss out EVERYTHING about Captain America (except the silly costume and the name), but they instead produce two generic thrillers that have plot holes the size of Steve's van.

For one thing, there's almost no action. Captain America spends more time running away from bad guys than actually fighting them, meaning that the ENTIRE FIRST MOVIE has only one fight scene (which mainly involves Steve pushing slabs of meat at the bad guys). The second movie is substantially better, but most of both movies seem to consist of... talking and driving.

NOTE TO FILMMAKERS: long lingering shots of OTHER people riding motorcycles are simply not interesting.

And the acting is not much better. Lead actor Reb Brown looks like he's been drugged much of the time, when his character isn't whining about how he just wants to be a wandering artist. Most of the other characters are so underdeveloped and nondescript that it's hard to remember them; the one exception is Christopher Lee, who seems vaguely annoyed all the time.

The 1970s were not kind to Captain America, and ""Captain America/Captain America II: Death Too Soon"" end up being too dull to be campy fun.",1314316800,23,2792,4.832285115303983
4688981,2,B005G5NPD8,"When I was a kid, I thought these two movies were really cool. It was around the time the Marvel had made deals with CBS to bring Characters like Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Doctor Strange to TV. You would think that they were going to be as well written and produced as the Hulk was, but alas, Captain America was not.

The story was set in the late 1970's instead and used the idea that Steve Rogers had just gotten out of the Marines and was called in by a scientist that had worked with Steve's Father on a Steroid called F.L.A.G (Full Latent Ability Gain). The Steroid worked to increase the stregth of the person or animal ifused with it, but killed them in the end. The only one that could take it was Steve, because it was from his Father. His Father apparently was the 1st Captain America.

Ok, This verges off from what the actual origon of the cahracter is. We don't even get a good looking sheild in this. It's a Bulletproof Glass that looks terrible. He can throw it like a boomarang, but it looks really fake. The only cool part was the bike he rode. The story is fractured. The villian in the 1st film know that if Steve gets the FLAG steoid, that he would be able to do things that only a perfect human could do. How did the villian find out about FLAG? We don't even get a suit that resembles the comic suit until the tale end of the first one. It looks really poor. It was a good try, but they should have taken their que from Wonder Woman and possibly started this in the 1940's instead.",1312934400,10,1515,4.2387543252595155

The second Captain America movie I guess they heard the outcry from the fans but they got the costume right.

4689006,5,B005G5NPD8,"Two terrible made for TV Captain America movies for the price of one? Hell yes!
First off, this isn't the Steve we all know and love. This is California Steve with feathered hair, cut-offs, and a 'tude.

Captain America (1979)
Steve has a complicated relationship with his dead father (no worries, not much of a spoiler) and dons the suit for the first time. It may be uncharitable, but any personality Reb Brown manages to conveys is that of confusion and constipation. He also has a deep relationship with his motorcycle and his van. To be honest I had a very difficult time following the plot. Worth it for the costume, the script, and the sound track.

Captain America II: Death Too Soon (1979)
Steve races to stop the villain Miguel (Christopher Lee!) from bombing the world with a gaseous ageing serum that will make people grow old and die in months. Faster paced than the first movie, same amazing logical leaps and still loves his motorcycle. If you watch closely you can see his plastic shield wobble when it knocks into things. Christopher Lee is the best thing in this movie, and that's including the evil fake veterinarian. It made me nostalgic for Christopher Lee's villain in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974). .

Before fans of this version of Captain America begin salivating, this is a very bare bones affair. No extras or subtitles are included. The main menu lets you select one of the two movies, which begin playing right away.

The presentation is very good. A nice remaster of the original broadcast master must have been done. The audio is serviceable, nothing extraordinary.

As for the movies, this is a very different Captain America than you may know from the comics, later movies or other media. This Steve Rogers is an ex-Marine who travels the country in his van. After he's forced into an accident, his only hope for recovery is an experimental serum his father created. He then takes down criminals as Captain America.

Luckily there's two stories, because the origin eats up most of the first movie. The second one deals with Steve taking down a terrorist group who threaten to spread a rapid aging chemical to the country if their demands are not met. (Christopher Lee plays terrorist leader Miguel, so there's a ""Christopher Lee Marvel connection"" for the trivia buffs.)

Maybe a motorcycling Captain America won't grab today's audiences, but for the curious and lovers of comic book characters with wild reinventions, this is worth checking out. It's almost like a ""What If?"" version of Captain America.",1441584000,3,1386,4.8808510638297875

I enjoyed these for what they were, but you have to take into account what they are. If you grew up in the 70's, you have probably forgotten, so I will remind you. Spider-man, the Hulk, and any other interesting character only ever showed up in the last few minutes of the show, and when they did, it was poor special effects and  long-stretched out segments that sometimes re-used footage even in the same fight scene. This is not quite that bad, but expect 8 minutes filler time watching Cap ride his motorcycle and plots that make little sense. If you are under 30, it is almost a guarantee you will be shocked and disappointed in what my generation had for entertainment when we were growing up.

4689044,4,B005G5NPD8,"This is not for everyone. In fact, had I not seen these movies when I was growing up and had a sense of nostalgia for them I doubt I would have much interest in them today. Well, that's not entirely true as I do enjoy B movies and Mystery Science Theater and these movies are ripe for the riffing. If you actually care to know both movies included on this disc are pretty much on par for most TV movies that were made at the time. Slow paced pot boilers with mildly interesting action scenes and slow motion jumps popularized by the BIONIC MAN. Reb Brown, or better known as ""Big McHugeLarge"" to us Misties, does the best he can with the material and comes off as a detached but lovable meathead. The first movie doesn't really get much right about Captain America's origin and doesn't bother to even try to replicate his costume at all. It seems to be inspired by another American hero of the time, Evel Knievel rather than the comic book alter ego of Steve Rogers. I'm guessing someone must have found the comic book iteration too ridiculous to try to translate to screen.  The second movie features Christopher Lee as the villainous ""Miguel"", one name only, like CHER and they came a lot closer to getting Cap's costume correct.  I like the second movie better but both are good for a chuckle if you can appreciate that they are a product of their time.

4689069,3,B005G5NPD8,"Well, it's certainly cheap enough.  In every sense of the word.  And you do get two movies for an incredibly low price.  Whether or not they are worth even that is cause for debate.

At worst, these two movies are very basic, low impact fare.  In the first feature we learn that the star of this yawn (I meant yarn) is not really Captain America, his father held that distinction.  So this set should really be titled Captain America Jr.  And Junior would rather paint than fight dastardly villains.  Junior is played with stupefying numbness by Reb Brown (a pleasant but personality-free..........I hesitate to say......actor).  The plot involves sinister doings by oil company bad guy Lou Brackett (Steve Forrest).  He's got a neutron bomb and he's not afraid to use it in a gold heist.  To circumvent any possible interference by the reluctant hero, bad guy Lou makes several attempts on Junior's life, finally succeeding, allowing Dr. Simon Mills (Len Birman) to inject the dying do-gooder with a super-steroid that saves his life and makes him super-duper strong.  Thus creating............da ta.............CAPTAIN AMERICA junior.  He's given a snazzy motor bike and made to wear what looks like Evel Knievel's long underwear (black would have been more slimming!).  The plot also involves a dead wife and dubious CPR.  By the end of the first movie he's given a new outfit........but he still looks like Wonder Woman.
As for the second installment, it's still Reb and Reb still can't act, he's still doodling all over the place when not battling your garden variety 70's thugs.  The bad guy moved up in quality with the hiring of that old bloodsucker Christopher Lee (taking home an easy paycheck for doing precious little).  Some aging serum is involved (everyone gets old watching this one!).  There's even a dam chase scene...........involving a dam.  There's also a veterinarian who only sees people patients, a case of home wrecking (literally), and an old lamb.  The second feature is marginally better than the first, but that's not saying much.

I couldn't possibly be made to watch either ever again, never.  Even under pain of death.  I may even give my eyes a good cleansing with peroxide just to be on the safe side.

Reb Brown was Captain America Steve Rodgers.  He looked like he jumped off the page and became a breathing person. The music was very patriotic sounding the motor cycle was just cool.
Ok the shield was kinda weak espically in the flying and when it hit the bad guy in the back in the second movie.  But we got the idea LOL.

Christopher Lee in the second film was just fantastic what an actor.

All in all these are worth having on dvd.

4689084,4,B005G5NPD8,"In the late `70s, Marvel super-heroes hit the small screen in a series of TV movies that met with varying degrees of success - though mostly favoring the underwhelming side. The success of ""The Incredible Hulk"" wasn't matched by CBS' ""Amazing Spider-Man"" series with Nicholas Hammond (though I'm still waiting for a soundtrack of Johnnie Spence's music from the first two-hour movie) or the forgettable, one-time sojourn of ""Dr. Strange.""

Universal and CBS also tried, twice, to make a series out of ""Captain America,"" re-christening Steve Rogers as an easy-going California guy who drives a van and hangs out by the beach. Lana Wood co-starred with Brown in the first movie (Brown actually plays Rogers' son, unaware of his father's earlier exploits as the original Cap) with Christopher Lee hamming it up in the sequel, ""Captain America II: Death Too Soon,"" which brought Connie Selleca onboard as the love interest.

Neither project worked well enough to bring the show to series, though Mike Post's scores are quite appealing in a late `70s, tuneful melodic manner, and each movie should still be of interest for nostalgia freaks and hardcore comic book fans old enough to remember them (younger viewers accustomed to the new Marvel movie are sure to be bored silly, however!).

Even if the tele-films feel more like ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" than a true rendition of the comic book (in the same way that ""The Incredible Hulk"" felt ""inspired"" by ""The Fugitive""), Shout's DVD set - coupling both on a single dual layer disc - should prove satisfying for interested viewers. The full-screen transfers and soundtracks are all just fine and the sub-$15 price (in most outlets) is perfectly acceptable.",1337040000,2,1705,5.039007092198582
4689085,3,B005G5NPD8,"This version of captain america came out in 1979 and these were made for tv movies. They were ok at best and Reb Brown is a good captain america. Sadly the whole comic book tradition is thrown out for these flicks. Reb is the son of captain america or maybe he isn't?. The stories are typical tv tales with average villians. The films though are fun in their own way. the dvd's look ok too. Don't expect too much and you'll find some enjoyment here. But I must remind people that even the latest movie strayed away from the original story quite a bit. the red skull is a nazi first then a creater of hydra. Still at least these are finally available on dvd. Now if they would only put out the dr. strange. Or the nick fury tv movies. I can understand though why anyone would dismiss these movies , I hated them at first but later found them entertaining.  These were made in 1979 at the same time the ""hulk' tv show was on. It was hoped to be tv series but in fact these movies were just too average for that. Christopher lee is featured in one of the movies here.",1336780800,2,1064,4.190243902439025
4689086,4,B005G5NPD8,"I remember the Reb Brown Captain America TV films from when I was a youngster, and I remember them with the same fondness that I do shows like the Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno INCREDIBLE HULK and the Nicholas Hammond AMAZING SPIDER-MAN series. These were fun because getting to see some of your favorite characters in real life, but they were also alternately frustrating because they had little or nothing to do with the actual peripheral characters. You weren't going to ever see The Hulk fight Abomination or The Leader; You were never going to see Spider-Man fight The Green Goblin or Doc Ock, and with these two films, you weren't going to see Cap fighting HYDRA or The Red Skull. They fought terrorists and crooks and racketeers, but never an actual comic book villain (although to be fair, Hulk did once team up with Daredevil to fight The Kingpin and he also teamed up with Thor:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incredible-Hulk-Returns-The-Trial-of-the-Incredible-Hulk/dp/B00595W3Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incredible Hulk Returns/The Trial of the Incredible Hulk</a>).

Even more frustrating about this collection is that almost everything you know about Steve Rogers is wrong here... except for really small details. Here, Reb Brown, who plays our hero, is already handsome and extra-muscular. He's just left The Marines and intends to just travel ""Nomad""-ically around this beautiful country with his artistic skills to try and find his place in the world in his conversion van and his motorcycle. He ends up being contacted by Dr. Simon Mills (played with a lot of sincerity by Len Birman), who is a scientist and doctor who is the head of several different projects and answers only to The President. He also worked with Steve's father, who apparently developed a serum called FLAG (Full Latent Ability Gain) which is supposed to make someone stronger, bigger, faster and better by allowing them to access their all of their brain and body abilities. The catch is that it only seems to work on those with Rogers' genetic code. Naturally, Steve gets himself embroiled in a conspiracy to construct a neutron bomb and ends up getting so badly hurt, he will only live if injected with the FLAG serum. At one point, Mills tells Steve that his father fought for the country and The President, and his enemies slapped him with the moniker of ""Captain America"", and that Steve should embrace this name, rather than scoff at it.

He's given a new van; one that actually hides a new jet-powered motorcycle in the back, and he's given a shield made of a transparent compound that has the red stripes and the blue and white star, and it's throwable and it's bullet-proof. Eventually, he gets a Evel Knievel-esque motorcycle suit, a motorcycle helmet with wings and a big ""A"" stenciled on it, and he goes into action as CAPTAIN AMERICA!!

The really interesting thing I noticed while watching it again was actually how certain really obscure details about Cap were presented in the film: Steve Rogers did spend a good amount of years in the 70's and 80's in the comic book working on art commissions out of his van, which was also his mobile headquarters... where his motorcycle was also secretly hidden!!

As far as technical specs, it's a standard TV ratio of 1:33:1, so while it may look pretty good on your flat-screen, it certainly won't take up the whole screen. You can choose between the first film or the second film, but there are no other special features and not even a chapter select feature. It's press Play and Pause and Stop... and that's all there is.

If you're a fan of the big-screen CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER mainly because it adheres so closely to his actual origins and abilities and would hate anything that deviates from the source material; well, frankly... you're going to hate these films, because these are pretty far out there from the source material. However, if you're a fan of cheesy 70's superhero TV, you'll really get a kick out of this CAPTAIN AMERICA collection of his two TV films.

4689087,5,B005G5NPD8,Finally the TV Captain America comes to DVD. I remember this from when I was a kid. It`s great and fun in the style of the Incrediable Hulk or Wonder Women. This is not today`s Captain but it is fun to watch. I still want the van and motorcycle.,1328313600,2,245,4.020408163265306

A lot of the story line from the comics wasn't adhered to but this was a new generation Captain America for a new day and a new time all in all both movie's were well done.",1327795200,3,343,4.104477611940299

Good shipping time and excellent condition!
Relatively corny version!  Story line is somewhat in line with the original story but has been tampered with.  Makes for a fair kids session ages 5 to 16.  Includes two full stories of Capt. America.",1326326400,,297,4.88
4689090,5,B005G5NPD8,"Back in the late 70s, Superheroes were all over TV.  In addition to Batman, Superman and Lone Ranger reruns from the 50s and 60s, in first run we had Wonder Woman (lasted 3 years), The Incredible Hulk (lasted 4), Spiderman (last 1 month, then came back sporadically the following year) and then there was Captain America. Reb Brown, remembered primarily for a SciFi bomb ""Yor, Hunter of The Future"" and a bit part in ""SSSSSSS"" was cast as a modern (1979) Steve Rogers who just got out of the marines, and was looking forward to some relaxation.  On getting 2 telegrams, one from a government scientist who knew his dad, and the other from a friend in trouble, Steve finds himself being attacked out of nowhere by the bad guys responsible for eventually killing his buddy, and eventually they run him off the road and leave him for dead.  To save Steve's life, the fore mentioned scientist and his aide inject him with a serum which his father had developed and increased his strength and agility.  The results are, he has the power now to take care of these baddies and learn why they killed his buddy (they wanted his plans for developing a neutron bomb, which they eventually develop and intend to use to blow up a vault at a gold depository). Thus is born Steve's new identity, Captain America, who goes after the bad guys, on a super fast motor bike, a boomerang type shield that can deflect bullets, and his new powers all disguised in a red, white and blue costume. That's in the first film.  In the second, an international terrorist posing a penitentiary warden kidnaps a scientist who had once developed an rapid aging formula and attempts to use it to age the world while he remains young. It's up to Captain America, to save the town our new baddie tests the formula on, and get it away from him before he ages the world.  In addition to Brown, cast in this rarely seen (except maybe on Syfy then SciFi Channel) since its original run doubleheader are, Len Birman as Simon Mills, the scientist who gives Steve his new powers, Heather Menzies (in the first film) and Connie Selleca (pre Tesh) as Wendy Day, his partner, Steve Forrest (fresh from S.W.A.T.) as Lou Brackett the bad guy in the first film, and Christopher Lee as Miguel, the baddie in the second.  Like the other shows of their time, these are pretty much comic book, although the stories are not FROM the comic, but still are nice G rated entertainment.  Technically I admit they look like they did back then, and the second film does not have the flashbacks from the first in the opening credit sequence originally but at least the majority of the storyline in both cases is there without cuts or commercials.  2 hokey movies, that were hard to get in the VHS day at a nice price.",1325203200,6,2755,4.5494949494949495
