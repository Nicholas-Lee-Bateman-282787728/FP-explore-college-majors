4683017,5,B005FLSZNS,"In this epic DVD, Sarah Palin challenges Einstein's E=MC2.  Can gravity in conjunction to the expanding universe at a rate of 235.059876 miles per second break into a 16th dimension? She thinks so!

Sarah also resolves the problems with Capitalism by coming up with an economic model that goes against Keynesian and Friedman theories, yet mathematically proving that the world would be a better place if she were in charge.

Sarah Palin shows us that folks in her tax bracket not paying their taxes and wiping out Middle Class America is a good thing - not a bad thing.  Hooray!

All proceeds to this DVD will go to the Sarah Palin Super Genius Fund; dedicated to making her Queen of Earth.  When Sarah Palin profits - we all profit!

God Bless America!",1314144000,22,753,4.659090909090909

I almost became, dare I say ""a tea party believer"". I had to purchase the book and try and verify what she claims she had accomplished. AND IT TURNS OUT she did all that she claims to a high degree. A good proof of this is what the Republican party members did to her when she tried to continue her efforts when she came up for re-election. You must read this book to TEMPORILY become a Palin believer . That is until you read other books highlighting her contradictory family life, transition and thirst for fame and money.

4683056,5,B005FLSZNS,"THE UNDEFEATED IS A WINNER - A NYC Movie Review ~(Written 7/1/11)

We still don't know whether Sarah Palin will run for president in 2012, but if she does, The Undefeated may just be her secret weapon. The film chronicles Palin's entry into the world of politics, her time as a mayor and a governor, her run for the vice presidency, and the remarkable reactions she continues to draw from The Right, The Left, and seemingly everyone in between.

Filmmaker Steve Bannon kicks things off with a bang: Palin being introduced as John McCain's running mate, followed by a sonic boom: a compilation of some of the worst, visceral, and down right weird attacks thrown at Palin from Hollywood blabber mouths. Along with the celebrities using profanity that would make a truck driver blush, there's also some eye opening shots of protesters dressed in anti-Palin gear that will have to be edited out for sure once this film hits theaters nationwide if The Undefeated is going to avoid an X-rating. These opening salvos hurled at Palin set the tone for the film. It shows clearly how she's been portrayed by the left-wing entertainment industry and by all of the mouth breathers who take time away from Mom's basement every once in awhile to scream and yell about a woman who's done nothing to them personally. Bannon then masterfully and creatively counters these off putting assaults with a little thing known as...the truth.

Governor Palin went almost instantly from a diligent, hardworking, successful, wildly popular governor in Alaska to a woman vilified by the national media and lefties nationwide. Alarming shots of a mannequin dressed as Palin hanging by a noose, Facebook pages wishing death on her, and hateful insults fired at her family members (kids included) really hammers home just how constant and nasty the assault on Palin has been. It leaves the viewer asking 'why?'. Bannon's examination of Palin's remarkable accomplishments only intensifies the head scratching.

Members of Palin's inner circle speak throughout the better part of the film. Each one standing in front of a background as white as an Alaskan snowfall. These are people who have played a major role in Palin's private and/or political life. They are believable and forthright. Meghan Stapleton, Palin's former senior advisor and spokeswoman is particularly compelling. Her candor about situations and how things really unfolded is refreshing. Stapleton's impeccable ability to convey a story really takes the viewer right into the thick of the Palin administration. Kristan Cole is another star of the piece. A longtime friend of Palin, Cole captures the personal side of her buddy Sarah. She speaks of a woman who's genuine and loyal. Someone who thinks of others first and doesn't bow down to pressure. Bannon backs up this character portrait as the film moves on.

Sarah Palin did not participate in the making of The Undefeated. In fact, Bannon never even met her. Her presence in the film however is mighty to say the least. Footage of Palin is used throughout. Still shots of her as a young girl, home movies of basketball games and get togethers, sound of Palin from her Going Rogue audio book, and several campaign events and speeches, including her coming out party at the 2008 Republican National Convention. Before Palin's splash on the national scene is looked at though, her historic feats to benefit The Last Frontier take center stage.

The Exxon Valdez oil spill is what inspired Sarah Palin to jump into politics and eventually be elected as Mayor of Wasilla. Fittingly one of the most powerful parts of The Undefeated focuses on oil and all that comes with it. When a powerful, intimidating to most, oil exec approaches Palin at an airport and basically gets in her face and tells her to back off, Palin it is recounted, simply says nothing and stares him down. The fat cat walks away knowing this woman meant business. A woman who means business is an overriding theme of this movie.

Palin is portrayed as a leader with a spine of steel. Yet, she still remains 'Sarah' to those who knew her when. Her reaction of ""Golly"" after clinching the GOP nomination for governor and sharing a brief moment with her Democrat opponent is priceless. She blows the whistle on Republicans who are crippling her state while still cooking meals and finding time to pull her daughter's hair into a pony tail. She comes across as God fearing yet fun, intelligent yet self-effacing, well-known yet grounded. A regular person who is looking to serve. Not someone who had anything handed to her. A modern day picture of what the Founding Fathers envisioned.

The most incredible testimony into the character of Sarah Palin is her stunning decision to give up a six figure position because she felt that would be the best move for the state. Sarah and her husband Todd were not wealthy people. Still, she did what was right instead of what was easy. Bannon showcases numerous examples of stories like this that were rarely reported on when Palin was running for Veep. Instead the media focused on her clothes, her accent, and really anything else they could use as a tool to break the Barracuda. Three years later, it is clear they failed.

More government is not the answer. A sentiment thrown around by many pols these days. Governor Palin lives up to the slogan. An eye opening moment comes when Bannon highlights Alaska's massive budget problems. Palin and her staff read the entire budget line for line, cutting along the way, until the spending plan is feasible. A politician that actually reads something word for word before they throw their John Hancock on it? Yes She Did. Perhaps Nancy Pelosi and others should've been informed of this technique when ObamaCare was on the table.

Sarah Palin did not back down from the old boys club of the GOP, or the oil big wigs, or anyone else. Her approach to leadership in Alaska serves as a microcosm of how she would go about things in Washington. In order to be the first commander in chief that wears lipstick (at least that we know of), Palin will certainly need huge support from Independents. The Undefeated captures Palin's 'Drill Baby Drill' mentality, something that should bode well with Indies if she does indeed run. Palin's understanding of energy options and her expertise on the state that holds so much potential in that department is brought to the forefront.

Parts of Palin's near perfect speech at the RNC sent chills through the theater. The clapping and fist pumping shows the exuberance Palinistas felt in 2008 is only stronger today. Her introduction to the world that night showed us a strong, confident conservative who delivered a speech that was pretty much flawless. Another example of something positive Palin has done that has just been brushed aside in favor of fabricated, frivolous attacks. The film also delves into a very important aspect of that 2008 race. Palin helped McCain. She did not hurt him. Folks turned out in droves for every campaign stop Palin was a part of. Supporters chanted, cheered, held up lipstick, and smiled. The governor from the 49th state energized a bid for the White House that was bumbling and stumbling. McCain soared in the polls after adding Palin to the ticket. As she continued to meet America, the numbers got even better for the GOP. With Palin on board McCain surpassed Senator Barack Obama and looked to be in good shape as the stretch drive neared. Then, it was the economy, stupid.

The Lehman Brothers collapse and poor economic announcement after poor economic announcement spelled the end of the line for McCain's final shot at Sixteen-Hundred. The media would like us to believe Sarah Palin brought the campaign down. She did not. She kept it respectable. After watching The Undefeated, you can't help but wonder what would have happened if Palin weren't muzzled by the McCain campaign. She was the one going after Obama's character and associations while McCain basically prefaced every comment on the stump with, paraphrasing here, ""I'm great and so is Obama but vote for me."" The 1962 Mets had a better strategy for winning than that.

Despite the McCain-Palin ticket coming up short, the nation got to meet a woman that Alaska already knew. While the disgusting low blows continued to pour in from the types who never had a date in high school and currently have a Keith Olbermann poster up in Mom's basement, others rallied behind Mrs. Palin. She is loved by Constitutionalists. She is championed by many who never were politically active before. The Undefeated rightfully credits Palin as a catalyst of the Tea Party movement.

After Obama downed McCain, Sarah Palin headed back to the state she loves. She was eager to get back to work on gubernatorial chores. Instead she was faced with monkey business. Out of nowhere ethics charges galore are thrown Palin's way. The movie shows Palin handling the falsehoods she's accused of with grace. Even though they kept on coming. The media would highlight each charge as a top story. Then each and every time the governor is cleared they'd be silent or bury the decision behind the local Tiddlywinks scores. Palin persevered. Footage shows a leader continuing to go about her business at home and in the governor's office.

The Undefeated stunningly gives us the inside view of just how blood thirsty the press has been. Reporters admittedly saying they were writing slam pieces on Palin. They were intentionally trying to bring her down. They even questioned whether Palin was really pregnant when she was carrying her fifth child! One of the most important revelations to come out of this work is the reason why Palin left the governor's job when she did. The ethics charges and costs that went with them were clobbering Alaska right in the bear skin wallet. Palin recognized this. Again, instead of putting herself first she thought of who she was serving. She did not want to leave the job she loved, but she did because she thought it'd be better for her constituents. A far cry from the 'quitter' spin that is put on her departure by The Left. Palin was getting the Saul Alinsky treatment, so she took the high road and a bridge to somewhere.

Along with Palin's RNC speech the audience also became animated when President Obama appeared on the screen. Raspberries and Bronx cheers rang out in this Big Apple screening room. Free speech. But, there were no vulgarities, no threats of violence, no inappropriate barbs. Simply displeasure from Americans regarding a man's policies. Quite the contrast of how 'people' go after Palin. The strangeness and deep, dark, horrific nature of the vitriol toward Palin is demonstrated very well in the film.

From a cinematography standpoint, Bannon's baby is pretty advanced as well. He mixes in humor, symbolism and some great shots of old time Alaska beautifully. Politics aside, what really stands out as to why The Undefeated is a winner is the way the film gets more and more exciting as it moves along. Two hours seems like 25 minutes. Then the grand finale. A Palin-Reagan crescendo.

Conservative pundits are featured in front of that white backdrop later in the film. Mark Levin and Tammy Bruce really present the Palin phenomenon in plain English. Bruce talks about what drew her, a former liberal, to Palin. It's quite simple really. Palin is the real deal. Levin compares the Tea Party and Palin to the Reagan Revolution.

Not unlike Palin herself, The Undefeated calls out Democrats and Republicans alike. Andrew Breitbart slams the manhood of the GOP men who stand in silence while Palin is ripped apart unfairly and viciously by The Left, Hollywood, and the press. He chastises them for their indifference and lack of action. I couldn't agree more. Breitbart also delivers the best line of the film, saying ""She (Palin) refuses to accept the premise of her destruction."" Ain't that the truth?

Ronald Reagan was looked at as unelectable when he first came on the scene. We've heard that term bandied about regarding Sarah Palin as well. Bannon does a superb job of comparing Dutch with Sarah. The Undefeated includes super clips of Reagan challenging the establishment, going after reporters and politicians who try to falsify his record, and through it all maintaining a smile and a sense of humor. The film shows The Left's disdain for conservative candidates. True conservatives. Remember how loved John McCain was before he actually sewed up the nomination. Look at the recent love affair with Jon Huntsman. It's the middle of the road Republicans the Dems want to face. The Undefeated is evidence of this.

We don't yet know if Sarah Louise Heath Palin will run for president in 2012, but we do know a lot more about her if she does decide to give it a go. Judging by the portrayal of Palin in The Undefeated coupled with the response from the audience, you'd have to think if she does throw her glasses into the ring she'd have a real chance of grabbing the nomination. Then she'd have to try to make President Obama 'The Defeated'. Impossible? About as impossible as challenging a corrupt system of good ol' boys, passing landmark ethics measures, cutting spending, and being the first ever woman on a GOP ticket, all while raising five children and facing unprecedented attacks on her character and family. Hold on tight. GAME ON.

4683057,4,B005FLSZNS,"A very good documentary to counter the hate propaganda of the Obama donors who produced the HBO fictional movie ""Game Change"". I challenge any Democrat to sit through the first five minutes of ""Undefeated"", where the viewer is treated to a generous sampling of the hate speech directed at Sarah Palin and her Down's Syndrome baby, from the ""compassionate Democrat left"".

Democrats don't debate ideas, they attack people, as directed by their socialist mentor Saul Alinsky. Sarah Palin's founding fathers are a bit different: Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and John Adams. It shows in this documentary, which quotes liberally from Sarah Palin's ""Going Rogue"" and her audiobook version.

After the shock of the opening Orwellian ""5 Minute Hate"" from the emotional left, the documentary traces Sarah's childhood roots growing up in Alaska, and her eventual run for Major of Wasilla. This is the best part of the documentary, which is very short on sentimentality. You'll learn more about her campaign style than the courtship of her High School sweetheart, Todd Palin. By keeping the focus on the facts, the documentary serves the purpose of showing this woman has a formidable intellect. Time and again, her male opponents underestimated her, as they learned to their chagrin that a mamma grizzly was more than a match for big money and the good old boy network.

The second part of the documentary follows Sarah as she moves up to the State level, where the big boys play. Here she took on Big GOP and Big Oil. That's right libs, Sarah is the ultimate outsider, fighting the entrenched Republican hierarchy that was in the back pocket of big business. This would come back to haunt her as she resumed the office of Alaskan governor after the 2008 election, when she was attacked by left and right.

But we're getting ahead of the third part of the narrative, that of Sarah being selected to be John McCain's running mate. Here I think the documentary suffers, where Sarah related the events of the 2008 election with a far more striking narrative. I would recommend reading her two books at present to get a firmer idea of the American principles which drive her conservatism.

The documentary's weakest moment is where the narrators try to agree with Sarah's decision to quit her term as Alaska's governor half way through, so that the people's business can resume without all those harassing ethics lawsuits she had to pay to defend herself from. If you're right, you stay in the fight. Quitting gave the left another sneering attack that she has been less successful in defending. Sarah is human, and this was a very human need to want to step back from the daily criticism of the socialist opposition. But she should have completed her term to the chagrin of the Democrats.

The documentary closes with her inspiring crowds of Tea Party activists in time to sweep the 2010 election, I thought this part was well done and saved the overall presentation. At times, the documentary got bogged down on Alaskan budget negotiating tactics, and could have done with less of the rapid-fire comments from Palin supports. The editing could have been better done, although I am pleased to see the late Andrew Breitbart and Mark Levin came across well. The accounts of various GOP women who were inspired by Sarah Palin's saga was also narrated well. I just did not like how they were edited almost to the point of completing each other's sentences.

Despite amateurish editing, the overall effort was a good one, and certainly a better summary of Sarah's place in modern political history than the caricature the left would write for us. At a time when the Democratic party claims to represent all American women in a ""war"" being waged against them, they did everything in their power to destroy Sarah Palin by attacking her gender, her looks, her attire, her intellectual capacity, and worst of all, her family.

This is the true war on women that the Democratic Party is on record as cheerfully waging with a powerful self-made woman who threatened everything the liberal world has created to benefit themselves. Liberals have hundreds of front organizations designed to enhance and further their own power. Sarah Palin is simply a small voice reminding us all that government exists as a servant of the people. That is the threat she poses to the totalitarian left, and that is why they did their best to silence her.

Through it all, Sarah Palin stands... undefeated.",1331078400,6,4484,4.905013192612137

I came away thinking here is a woman who took on the CBC (Corrupt Bastards Club) and by the time it was over most all of them went to jail. She did this by giving up a high paying job as the Alaska Oil and Gas Commissioner. Sarah said in politic's you either eat well or sleep well and she chose to sleep well. She then becomes Governor of Alaska and takes on the Oil Corporations and there again she beats them. During her time as Governor she is well liked by both sides of the isle and has a 80% approval rating. The highest rating of any Governor ever recorded. This film also deals with her vice presidential run and the mainstream media's treatment of her. All in all Sarah Palin is a fascinating woman. But i think she is an ordinary woman who is unique.

She showed a portion of those comments and just how far they went. She proved to me how much of a threat she was to their ambitions of power by all the madness.

I for one, didn't know who she was beforehand. But, I (unlike liberals who act worse then children) wasn't about to judge her until I actually knew who she was. This seems like quite a novel thing to actually know someone before passing judgement on them.

This video explained all the great things she did in the state of Alaska and how the problems there are very unique compared to the lower ""48 states"". The courage to stand up to Exxon and her own party and who she ousted Lisa Murioksi's RHINO corrupt father in the election for governor.

4683066,5,B005FLSZNS,"I think that I've bought the excellent film about the excellent American. She is a living proof that your nation is still able to produce exceptionally decent citizens - being an attentive witness to the ways of the modern world's leaders, I can't name a single politician so gifted, patriotic and (the main thing!) so courageously honest as Ms. Sarah Palin is. My deep admiration for her isn't the result of the film: she was an example for me since in early nineties I became a representative of my small Arctic town (kind of Siberian Wasilla) in our regional Parliament - which was later disbanded by Yeltzyn as ""too separatist"". We weren't separatists, we were simply following Alaskan lessons: your voters' interests are everything, while those of establishment are nothing, - and this stand, as the film rightly states, is an existential threat to any irresponsible bureaucracy, be it the American or the Russian one. Since nineties my respect for this outstanding lady was strengthened by many her later great speeches and, of course, by two thrilling books (I've tried to contact her to get her permission for the ""Going Rogue"" Russian translation, but unfortunately couldn't find her address anywhere). I can well understand the meek Russian reaction for our bureaucracy ""stomping the separatists"" - a lot of our voters have a genetic fear of any resistance, developed during many decades of GULAG, exile and outrageous poverty. But the same meek behavior in the Land of the Free is absolutely incomprehensible to me. As I see from your media and blogs, many Americans seek a solacing refuge in the idea ""Well, maybe in the next elections she would be experienced enough for our national support"". It's a soothing idea, indeed. Exactly the same things our Russian voters were whispering right before the accursed days of 1917. The sad thing, however, was that there were no ""next elections"" since 1917 in our country until the very crush of the USSR - and the present-day Kremlin bureaucracy (or, rather, cleptocracy) seems to be quite devoted to the old traditions too. I cross my fingers to be wrong, but with the clearly Socialistic inclinations of your establishment, the American 2012 has all the chances to transform successfully into our 1917. Which, naturally, would make ""The Undefeated"" banned at once, so I'm very happy to have it in my collection - side by side with John Wayne's masterpieces.

4683067,5,B005FLSZNS,"I watched Sarah Palin's speech when John McCain introduced her as his running mate.  I was really impressed with her.  She has so much energy, charisma, and is a wonderful speaker.  I was impressed with her record in Alaska.  I have never heard of any governor with such a high approval rating.  Her appeal is that she is very relatable-the opposite of Barack Obama.  I couldn't figure out why the media attacked her so much or why Obama attacked her views.  This documentary feels that she was attacked because she is a threat to Obama and I have to agree.

I never knew about her record in Alaska.  Wow!  I am so impressed.  She is an honest and effective politician.  I could not get over the stuff she got done in Alaska.  She got the big oil company to start drilling in northern Alaska.  I was impressed that she cut the state's budget.  She is definitely one tough cookie.

Regarding her quitting being governor, I don't believe the documentary's view.  That she quit because of the state wasting money on all of the ethics lawsuits brought against her.  I think she quit because of the personal attacks and I can't say that I blame her.  There was little more that she could do while she was governor of Alaska because no one was willing to work with her.  She still fights on with her website and Tea Party.  I think she will lay low for awhile and let the media forget her and then rise up again.

I had to give this five stars because it made me respect Sarah Palin more.

Divide Alaska into two equal parts and Texas would be the third largest state.  The Movie ""The Undefeated"" shows the rugged beauty of Alaska and celebrates a great Alaskan, Sarah Palin.

Sarah Palin was elected mayor of Wasilla.  She had a different vision than the current city government who favored higher taxes, more regulations, building a large city hall.  As mayor, Sarah Palin cut taxes, invested in infrastructure, reduced regulations.  Her policies set off a building boom that made Wasilla the fastest growing community in Alaska.  She was re-elected mayor with a 75 percent majority.

""The Undefeated"" shows Sarah Palin's grassroots campaign for governor.  We learn about the notorious hotel room overlooking the capitol building in Juneau where special deals were struck between legislatures and Big Oil.  Learn how Sarah Palin and her team took on Big Oil and renegotiated a better deal for the Alaskan People.  This better deal is known as ACES - Alaska's Clear and Equable Share.

4683079,5,B005FLSZNS,"Monday night, I met Stephen K. Bannon, producer of Undefeated. The showing was followed by a Q and A with Mr. Bannon who explicated the finer points of the film.

Undefeated is not about Sarah Palin, it is about the battle we are in for if we are to retain our sovereignty, not to mention rebuilding it. As things stand now, we have to rebuild our sovereignty.

The picture was about supporters and the resonance of values which were undiscovered as lost or asleep. We know that they are not lost nor sleeping, but erased and punished, and we are in for more of the same, that's for sure.

We have faced corruption throughout the life of the nation, but we are in for meeting a foe which has become the most vicious ever. We have endured looting of the nation for a long time, but we are now in for more than looting, we are fighting for our very lives.

The point is that we know this, but I must add on my own that there are two more things working: 1. Our knowing it is not enough; everyone must know it. It explains a lot of whatis happening to us all as one people. 2. A lot of us who think we grasp the danger do not fully grasp it, that is if involvement and action are any measure of comprehension.

Marxists who show their hand in hostility to this nation are each shamelessly doing their small part by the millions to loot and then destroy our country afterward. Destruction of the U.S. is part of the goal. It's not enough that they take it all, they want to ruin it all so that it never again becomes a threat to corruption.

Pick up a copy of Undefeated and circulate it in your group, please. We asked Mr. Bannon what we can do, and his answers to our questions were most passionate and articulate. Buy the movie and watch it with friends.

Take particular note of the haranguing and crude canards of bad taste which patriots are enduring, and let it take in speaking for itself. These are the people teaching children, making policy, taking guns - even threatening rape and murder if police don't get funded - dealing with enemies of America and bowing to others, and abusing due process.

Think of how our liberty movement resonates with others who have not yet detected the danger. While Marxists are doing their small part, we need to gather and each do our large part in protecting the values of our society and of reaching the rest of the electorate.

We have to rebuild our sovereignty, and that will require even defining what that is to the rest of the country, or we won't have one shortly after 2012.

4683084,5,B005FLSZNS,"I watched Sarah Palin's ""The Undefeated"" last night.  Basically a documentary of her career.  And it pretty much confirmed what my general impression of her has been. That she really was an ordinary, hard-working, middle-class citizen that got into local politics for the right reasons, and rocketed to stellar success by ... not being a politician.  I defy you to find any facts (facts, mind you) that say different.

This allowed her to simply resign from a 6 digit salary job she found herself in when appointed to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission -- over the deep corruption she saw there.

This is not something politicians do.

This made her wildly popular with Alaskans, and 3 years later she ran for governor and won, slashing state spending and simultaneously increasing state income, and holding a consistent 80%+ approval rating. She stared down big oil executives into sh*tting or getting off the pot on oil leases, broke its monopoly on oil leases and opened it to true competition, did not use the Governor's chef, preferred to sleep at home when possible, sold the Governor's jet, refused to take a commission-reccomended pay raise ... and using about 20% of what the previous governor used in expenses.

It was only after she was chosen to run as McCain's vice presidential candidate that her whole history was suddenly and retroactively revised to that of a corrupt idiot.

Frankly, I think she's exactly the kind of person we need in the White House. Buck stops here, no-nonsense, get it done steward of The Peoples' freedom.

I read Katie Couric's blurb on Palin deciding not to run in 2012. In it, she talked about ""the question"", ""And when it comes to establishing your world view, I was curious, what newspapers and magazines did you regularly read before you were tapped for this -- to stay informed and to understand the world?""

Well, you know what? I don't, myself, regularly read any particular newspapers or magazines. I read articles from dozens of them, but I don't pay a lot of attention to what publication the article appeared in - I'm more interested in the content of the articles. I don't have a publication I turn to for a ""media guru"" to validate my opinions.

And just like most regular Americans, I suspect neither did Palin. Now if I sat and thought about it, I could name some. (WSJ, NYT, UK Times, LA Times, Miami Hearald, Chicago Tribune, Washington Times, Washington Post, Orange County Register. I even occasionally read Slate and Mother Jones articles. But I'm not in the middle of an interview with Katie Couric. I got a chance to sit and think about it without my readers seeing an awkward pause. And nobody's playing ""gotcha"" with me on National TV) And again, their names aren't important to me.

As for her resignation as governor, it seems to me that Palin got more accomplished in 2 years than many governors accomplish in 4 or even 8, and I completely understand that the onslaught of politically motivated and universally dismissed as frivolous ""ethics complaints"" that were filed against her along with the sudden turn of Democrats who had been working well with her -- now suddenly against her, as well as establishment Republicans' desire to distance themselves from her sudden supposed idiocy -- some still smarting from her clamping down on corruption and cronyism ... was breaking her family financially (the Palins were not rich, and a half million dollars was a lot of money!). And it was also paralyzing any efforts to get her previously popular, but now suddenly taboo -- agenda passed.

She did the right thing.

Like she's always done when the chips were down.

At worst, Palin-haters in the media have established new lows of vicious, vulgar, vitriolic bile, the likes of which America has not seen.

It was refreshing to finally get to hear the Sarah Palin story without all of that ugly, irrational bias tainting its telling and what a story it is! While the quality of the documentary rarely rises above the level of a local network evening news piece (and relies far too heavily on generic stock footage imho), the story it tells will grip you and give you hope for America. If Sarah Palin, one woman, a mom and wife you might meet at any church or supermarket can make such a difference in Alaska and across America, how can we all sit idly by wringing our hands? That was the question I found myself asking as the film concluded and I already know what my answer will be. I can't sit idly by and I don't intend to. This is a woman and a movement that is worth every penny I can give and every minute of time I can dedicate and I don't intend to be stingy.

4683094,5,B005FLSZNS,"What can you say about an independently produced documentary that opened in ten select markets with absolutely no traditional advertising, but managed numerous screenings to more than half-full and even sold-out theaters? What can you say about an independently produced documentary receiving multiple cheers, applause, jubilant outbursts, and even standing ovations during those screenings? What can you say about an independently produced documentary that achieved this in the middle of summer up against blockbusters such as ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part Two"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger?"" What can you say about an independently produced documentary when you discover that lies about it being shown to empty theaters make international news stories, nearly every major film critic has ripped it to shreds, and popular movie web sites such as Rotten Tomatoes has given it a 0% ""fresh"" rating? It must be a documentary about Sarah Palin, right? Yes, the ""lame-stream media"" is at it again--attempting (and failing) to squash the Power of Palin, her popularity among average, hard-working, and patriotic citizens, and the prospect of her possibly making a run towards the highest office in the land.

I believe that this film, ""The Undefeated,"" created by award-winning producer-writer-director Stephen K. Bannon, is The Most Important Documentary of Our Lifetime. As an elderly, female ticket-taker working at the AMC Ahwatukee 24 multiplex in Phoenix stated, ""I think every American should see this movie. It gave me goose bumps! It should be shown and taught in every grade school.""

Mr. Bannon set out to tell the story of Governor Palin's incredible rise from obscurity as an average wife and mother in a small community with no traffic lights to becoming the most popular governor of any state in the history of the United States, with approval ratings of between 80% and 88% (and as high as 93%) during her two and half years in office. He does so with rare family footage, newsreels, newspaper clippings, and testimonials from those who worked closely with her, along with observations and commentary from Andrew Breitbart, Mark Levin, Sonnie Johnson, and Tammy Bruce. The film's narration is Sarah's own voice via the audio-book version of her New York Times #1 bestseller, one of only four political memoirs to sell over a million copies (in fact, it was the #1 selling non-fiction book of 2009, selling 2,674,684 hardback copies in under 2 months), ""Going Rogue: An American Life.""

Broken into three acts with subchapters--plus a coda, ""The Undefeated,"" in 113 minutes, serves a great deal of information about the former governor and vice presidential candidate which was previously withheld from, overlooked, or ignored by the vast American public during the last three years while she was, arguably, the most vetted political figure ever in American history.

Critics of the documentary claim the film is one-sided and borderline propaganda as it omits certain lowlights. Bannon made the correct decision not to include what has already been, in most cases, wrongly rammed down our throats. The purpose of ""The Undefeated"" is to be a beacon of hope for America, inspiring patriots as it sheds light on the real Sarah Palin nobody in the voting booth truly knew or understood on November 4, 2008.

Contrasted with the imagery of her childhood set in the incredibly beautiful landscape of Alaska, ""The Undefeated"" shocks you early with a montage of incredibly hateful and tasteless (really slanderous and repugnant) comments from the likes of Rosie O'Donnell, Sharon Osbourne, David Lettermen, Howard Stern, Matt Damon, John Cleese, Bill Maher, Sandra Bernhard, and Madonna. My hair stood on end and I wanted to rise on my hind legs, directing my grizzly roar and a stiff middle claw to these self-righteous and arrogant ""stars."" Some folks talk about a lack of civility in this country. This is evidence. The hypocrisy and the double standards of the left know no bounds.

With horrible images of oil-soaked waterfowl, Sarah describes in painful detail the heartbreaking devastation the Exxon Valdez spill caused Alaska in 1989. It affected not only the environment, but also nearly destroyed the fishing industry, ripping apart families as they collapsed under the stress of lost income, the threat of foreclosure, rampant alcoholism, and the inherent despair leading, in some cases, to even suicide. This tragedy planted a ""seed"" into what she refers to as a ""servant's heart.""

""The Undefeated"" then illustrates, out of concern for her family's future, how she achieved success as the proactive young mayor of Wasilla. Palin's efforts helped to expand infrastructure, attracted large retailers, created jobs, and allowed local government to cut property taxes in half while revenue doubled. Despite negative press and opposition from a former mayor, she won reelection in a landslide, getting 75% of the vote.

As Wasilla became a ""hot spot,"" a great place to stake a claim and raise a family, Sarah Palin's star, of course, rose and she eventually accepted an appointment to serve on the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. She is then named Chair of the Commission as well as Ethics Supervisor. Aside from learning first-hand about the oil industry, Palin also gets a taste of state-level corruption--and in November 2003 filed non-public complaints with the state attorney general as well as then Governor Murkowski against fellow Commission member Randy Ruedrich, a former petroleum engineer who also happens to be the State Chairman for the Republican Party. In January 2004 she left the Commission and made the charges public. Ruedrich was fined.

In 2006, having earned a solid reputation for ""clean government,"" Palin challenged Murkowski in the Republican primary for governor and beat him soundly. She then beat Democrat Tony Knowles becoming Alaska's first female governor and, at the age of 42, the youngest governor ever of Alaska.

""The Undefeated"" not only shows the strong work ethic of Palin and her staff, it clearly demonstrates her courage to challenge the status quo. She fought the infamous ""Corrupt Bastards Club,"" she fought her own political party, and she fought ""big oil""--and won every time.

By defending the Constitution of Alaska, protecting the state's resources, and accomplishing major projects which ensure ""energy independence"" (projects that had been put off for 30 years by others), it becomes obvious why she was able to score as high as 93% approval among all voters in Alaska--in turn, attracting the attention of Senator McCain.

One clear message in ""The Undefeated"" is this: Sarah Palin loves Alaska, Sarah Palin loves America, and Sarah Palin has a ""servant's heart,"" getting into politics for the ""right reasons.""

I don't care if you're Democrat, Republican, Green, or Independent. I don't care if you're conservative, liberal, or content to be run over in the middle-of-the-road. If you care about America and if you consider yourself reasonably intelligent and fair, you must see this movie. Don't see it because it is about Sarah Palin, see it because it is about us. It will challenge you. It will inspire you. It is The Truth on screen. I reiterate, ""The Undefeated"" is the Most Important Documentary of Our Lifetime.

4683102,5,B005FLSZNS,"I must first state that I've not seen the film ""The Undefeated"" as of yet, but in the end, I don't have too. I'm an individual that is quite familiar with Governor Palin and have been for some time, which is partially due to my having family members that have lived in Alaska for the last 30 years and partially because I have spent my entire life's career (nearly 5 decades) in the transportation and transportation energy industries.

As far as my political affiliations, generally speaking, I'm an independent, because I do not, nor have I ever voted along party lines, I vote for individuals. That's the way it is suppose to work in a Constitutional Republic, like the United States.

We now live in a society, where information is instantaneous,  which unfortunately means we are over-whelmed by miss-information as well, where newscasters tend to report miss-informed opinion, rather than the truth, but even worse, we also live in an America where our young people are not taught the truth of American history, like, who were our founding fathers (?), what did they believe in(?), and what was their hope for the future(?).

Leaders like Governor Palin only come along every 2 or 3 generations or so, where they rise to the full consciousness of the American public, while most potential leaders never rise above Mayor or Governor, if that. Governor Palin has a unique sense of the obvious, a rare level of common sense, a unique ability to realize that the most important part of being a leader is to actually lead by action, rather than by words, speeches, or self-interest prophesizing, or through the application of a theoretical agenda for governing. Governor Palin has over 20 years experience in the private sector and the executive branch of government. Which is why I found it interesting that during the 2008 campaign, the majority of the media projected Governor Palin as being too ""inexperienced"" to lead(?). This is interesting considering that she was the only nominee with ""any"" experience in the executive branch of government. (neither Obama, Bidden, nor McCain had any experience, ever, in the executive branch of government, only Governor Palin had had that experience).

Because the news media is so bias, we Americans rarely get the truth, for example; what I most often hear from ""politicians"" or from the news media, is that America only has 3% of the world's energy sources (oil), but uses  25% of the world's supplies. Governor Palin is the first ""politician"", that I've heard, to state the truth or reality that North America has 70% of the world's known oil reserves, more then twice the rest of the world combined. Now that is the truth.

In addition to this film, I would also suggest the book ""Sarah Takes on Big Oil"", which was written by two Alaska Regional newspaper reporters. Want to see America stay what was realized by our founding fathers(?), then we need leaders like Sarah Palin, to save America for our children and our grand-children. Watch this film, tell your friends and family to watch this film, not everyone is going to change their mind, but those that believe in America and rather its worth saving will thank you.",1317427200,26,3172,4.862962962962963

A documentary covering Sarah Palin's rise from Mom to Mayor to VP candidate and beyond. Looking at all the reviews for this, including IMDb, Amazon & Rotten Tomatoes I noticed that they were all politically biased. Palin lovers gave it high grades,haters gave it low. I'm going to try and do the first non-politically based one. The movie begins with Palin talking about Alaska in the late 90's and the Valdez oil spill. Then the interviews begin. The entire time I watched this I couldn't help but compare it to a Michael Moore movie (who I do not like at all). The comparisons are based on the entire movie is 100% one sided. All the interviews are with former staff workers of hers. I'm not saying that you should only interview people against her or not put in people to defend her, but one guy continuously compares her to Reagan while another compares her to a marine. Some of these are a little over the top. I can go either way with Palin, but I feel that she went from a politician who cared about the people and her state to a celebrity. From a governor to a Kardashian if you will. On a side note, the music was distracting. Using music that would be used at the end of a sports movie, but only a 5 second clip, that repeats itself, for 2 hours. The movie could have been a half hour shorter and not lost anything. I refer to this as a movie on purpose, I can't call this a documentary in the same way I can't call a Michael Moore movie a documentary. They are too one-sided to be taken seriously. Overall, this is the type of thing you would see at a political convention that hypes you up to see the candidate. This does not work as a documentary released to the public. On the other hand it is not deserving of all the negative politically biased reviews that it got. In hopes of staying out of a debate, and due to the fact that there is really nothing of substance in this I will not give it a grade.

Would I watch again? Most likely no.",1317340800,18,2048,4.305699481865285
4683105,5,B005FLSZNS,"""The Undefeated"" leaves the viewer with the reaction, ""Wow, I had no idea!""  This is the story of how a young housewife with no family in politics and no wealth rose to become the first female Republican candidate for Vice President and a possible candidate for President in 2012.  It's a story that the Republican Party should have told in 2008 but they didn't want to publicize the corruption in their party which she defeated so the opposition was left to define Sarah Palin.

She didn't sleep her way to the top.  She didn't have a wealthy sponsor pushing her.  She didn't have personal ambition and desire for power.  She had a family who held signs for her at intersections in the cold Alaska winter, a servant's heart, faith, honesty, a willingness to attack problems without fear of failure, and an unrelenting desire to reform a political system rife with corruption.

This is not a film about a glamorous celebrity.  It's about the nuts and bolts of being a leader, attacking serious issues, getting people to work together, and reaching the best possible solutions on behalf of the people.  The film uses news footage from her early years in politics and narration from co-workers in her administration in Alaska to give an inside look at her style of management.

Before you decide who should represent Republicans in 2012, see this film.  No other candidate could be the subject of a film like this.",1317340800,28,1412,4.769547325102881
4683106,5,B005FLSZNS,"UPDATE:  I'm adding the following preamble to my review:  There is a concern troll who posted a ""1"" rating, admitting they had not seen this movie, but rather posting a ""review"" only to get on their Don Quixote horse and wave their arms in concern over some Palin support site asking people (who have seen the movie) to come here and rate it.  I have no problem with that as long as the people have actually seen the movie.  Of course supporters are going to give it a positive review if they saw the movie and it inspired them.  I don't think anyone is being asked to rate this movie who hasn't seen it; however, it is clear that several of the ""'1"" ratings here are from people who simply dislike Sarah Palin and, like school children who hate the popular girl, they use the rating system to lash out.  To me, that's a bigger problem than fans giving it a positive rating (again, as long as they have seen the movie).  For what it's worth, my review is honest and from the heart.  I actually saw the movie when it opened at that Highlands Ranch theater in Colorado.  The theater was sold out and there were several points in the movie where the audience applauded and cheered.  I took a friend who was neutral on Palin to the movie with us and he was impressed.  I would add one other recent development:  This past Sunday, I sat my Palin-hating sister-in-law down and had her watch this movie on PPV.  After the movie was over, I asked her what she thought?  She said she had no idea about all of Palin's accomplishments and she said she has changed her opinion of Sarah Palin.  So lastly, I'd just suggest that if you hate Palin simply because you hate conservative values, then don't waste your money on this movie.  However, if you are open-minded then, regardless of positive or negative reviews here, I recommend you see this movie yourself and form your own opinion.  Simple concept.

Now my original review:

My wife and I had a trip to Denver scheduled to visit her sister and we knew that ""The Undefeated"" was premiering in Denver while we were there.  So, being the curious types, we purchased a couple of tickets for the Highlands Ranch theater there and went to see this movie when it opened.  The first several minutes of the movie (sold out by the way) were quite disturbing (to any decent person).  The first several minutes is a montage of ""celebrities,"" media personalities, and ""comedians"" saying some of the most vile, hate-filled things about this woman (and her family, including her little Downs Syndrome son, Trigg) that one could imagine.  As I watched the opening of this movie, I just sat there stunned and asked: ""Why?""  What on Earth could cause so many people - fellow Americans - to express such abject hatred towards a woman who's only crime was to put herself forward in the name of service?  The answer, after watching this movie was clear:  She represents an existential threat to everything the left holds dear.  She also represents a threat to the establishment political machine - on BOTH sides of the political isle.

After the disturbing opening, the movie goes into a segment on her childhood and highlights the sort of pioneer upbringing she had.  It highlights the strong American values her school teacher parents instilled in her!  Then it talks about how the Exxon Valdez disaster (oil spill) was one of the catalysts that inspired her to enter politics in the first place, initially as a City Council person.  It tracks her rise to Mayor, then ultimately to Governor.  What is interesting about this movie is that you will learn of the many accomplishments that she had, both as Mayor and later as Governor.  I was more than a little upset that much of what she actually accomplished in Alaska were things the media completely ignored.  How was it possible that American's outside of Alaska didn't know her record when, after all, AP had sent no less than eleven or twelve reporters dispatched to Alaska to ""research"" her during the 2008 campaign?.  After seeing his movie, one realizes that the media wasn't interested in telling America about her record - they were only interested in finding ""dirt"" on her to tear her down.

Any reasonable person will walk away from this movie a little angry at the realization of not being told about her real record all this time. I am reminded of the recent media acquisition of 24 thousand of her emails and how the media enlisted the public to help dig through her emails looking for some ""smoking gun"" to prove, once and for all, that she was the unethical airhead that so many in the media have sold to us.  Can you think of any other politician who has been subjected to this level of ""vetting?""  Yet, in the end, all this email search did was to make clear that she was a very engaged, very active Governor who actually cared about the people of Alaska.  Isn't it funny that, after all the fanfare leading up to this massive email-searching campaign, the media quickly dropped talking about it once it was clear there was no ""dirt,"" but only things that put her in a positive light - we can't have that!!!  But back to the movie:

Much of the movie is a very detailed look at the things she accomplished and how she went up against her own party and the oil industry to expose and put a stop to corruption!  In the end, the movie goes into great detail about her much-maligned decision to step aside as Governor and hand the reins over to her Lt Governor.  Her detractors are quick to point their boney fingers at her and call her a ""quitter"" but it is clear that she did what she honestly felt was best for her State given the non-stop string of frivolous ethics complains she was facing (and which she had to spend her own money to defend).  She knew that, after the 2008 election, the Democrat's in the legislature were no longer going to cooperate with her and that her agenda for Alaska was dead in the water.  By removing herself as the target, she knew that much of her agenda would be able to move forward.

One of those close to her at that time said that she wasn't the kind of Governor to tackle the ""School Uniform"" kind of problems, but rather, as this movie makes clear, she would go after the ""Gordian Knot"" problems.  If you are one of the Palin Haters (like the one's rating this movie ""1"" most likely without actually watching the movie) then probably no amount of truth is going to change your mind about her, so don't waste your time watching this movie.  However, if you're someone with an open mind who wants to learn some things about her that the media may not have told you, then I urge you to see this movie.",1317340800,70,6629,4.5125628140703515

4683108,5,B005FLSZNS,"I watched this movie on Pay Per View.  I wanted to learn more about this self made woman who has made such an impact in today's political arena.

This documentary is well researched and presents Sarah Palin's past political career accomplishments in an objective view point.

This documentary also focuses on the media malpractice that occurred when Sarah Palin was picked to be the VP candidate in 2008 for the GOP.

Everyone should watch this movie and make their own informed opinions and impressions about Sarah Palin, rather than allow the media to form those impressions for you.

I don't care if you are progressive, liberal, moderate, or conservative.  Everyone needs to see what kind of strong, self made woman that America can produce.  I found her story inspiring and I am encouraging all young women in particular to watch this DVD so they can see what possibilities there are for hard work and a determined will.",1317254400,34,925,4.853503184713376
4683109,1,B005FLSZNS,"At long last, a movie has come along to supplant ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" as the worst movie of all time. ""Plan 9"" director Ed Wood had shot scenes with Bela Lugosi for different projects. After Bela died, Wood then used the scenes in ""Plan 9"" and filled in other scenes by using a much taller actor, still in Bela's short cloak. In one scene the character will go from Bela, to the double, back to Bela. But Sarah Palin has managed to pull even more unlikely characterizations out of her hat. At various points in this movie she's a grizzly mama, a political maverick, a victim of the ""liberal media,"" a woman persecuted by strangers for lies and innuendo-- Sarah Palin is Everything to Everybody!

She even manages to outdo ""Plan 9's"" horrible special effects where you can actually see the strings holding up the spaceships. In this movie you can see Sarah pulling puppet strings herself. She manipulates the American public into thinking she's a serious candidate even though she refuses to answer direct questions from anyone but Fox News employees. She says one thing and then contradicts it later as if there were no internet or video record.

All in all, the terrible production values, the lack of a straightforward narrative, and the uncompromising idiocy of Sarah Palin make this a movie that takes its rightful place at the head of the Bad Movie pantheon.",1317168000,43,1371,4.7322175732217575
4683110,1,B005FLSZNS,"Some movies are well written, well edited, well acted, well directed. Others aren't. This is one of the latter.

They say a person's character is built as much on their failures as their successes, but according to the narrative here, Sarah Palin's entire life has been one long string of victories...and the title even suggests that. Whatever drama this film lacks it tries to make up for with an assaulting, bombastic soundtrack which heralded the beginning of an overlong catalogue of insults to anyone who appreciates the art of motion pictures and documentary making.

This is a low budget production, and it shows. I don't believe it cost a million dollars to make, unless they paid the (just barely out of high school) director and the guy who wrote the ridiculous score fifty times more than the value of their work product. It has a $50,000 budget feel to it, no matter how much it actually cost to make. Just about everything else about the movie is poor from a creative and technical POV - from the jerky editing to the ridiculous use of stock footage (I thought I had mistakenly gone to a screening of ""Animal Planet""), to the use of extracts from the ""Going Rogue"" audiobook instead of professional narration...I dunno, maybe they were going for the Ed Wood effect - make the worst movie possible and one day it will be a cult classic?

But of course the announcer told us that this was a ""rough cut"" whereupon I realized it was ""Unfinished"" and made me think the producers must have blown the post-production and testing budget on the wrap party.

Epic fail.",1316908800,55,1572,4.684782608695652

This movie only captures a small essence of the Governor. It shows what a true patriot is, and above all it shows that she loves this country. It touches on some of her accomplishments a mayor of Wasilla. How she brought in the infrastructure to help it grow and prosper. As Governor, she tackled the budget, line-item by line-item. She worked side by side with her staff very long hours. She made tough budget calls when her state had a surplus, instead of spending willy nilly and because of that her state prospered. Alaska continues to prospers thru another one of Palin's programs: ACES. She encountered corruption, and she fought it. The magnificent seven are also mentions here (the Alaskan ones).

4683115,5,B005FLSZNS,"No political figure has been more wrongfully smeared than Sarah Palin.  The Undefeated will explain why while delivering topnotch, stirring entertainment and an uplifting story about the American spirit.

Independent-minded people will discover that as Governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin was a courageous fighter for the people and had the guts to take on the corrupt Republican machine as well as Big Oil.  Statists, on both the Left and the Right, are not fans of reform.  They don't want to lose their power or special privileges.  Spending someone else's money (taxpayer dollars) on personal gain and self-interest is a nice gig if you can get it.

The political machine and establishment know that if Sarah Palin came to Washington, she would not support their self-serving agendas.  It would be all over for the fat cats, lobbyists, back room deal makers.  Sarah Palin represents an existential threat to their cushy fiefdom.  As a result, they have sought to destroy her.  But, character is often forged in an inferno.  In the face of vicious libelous attacks that have known no bounds of decency, such as going after her sweet baby with Downs Syndrome, the most vulnerable among us, Sarah Palin has stood strong and remained true to her calling -- a better America for all its citizens.

Below is just one example of what Sarah Palin stands for and what she accomplished:

Palin rid Alaska of the corruption-ridden, structurally-flawed Petroleum Profits Tax of the previous Murkowski administration and replaced it with ACES (Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share).  ACES stimulated development while returning to Alaskans -- resource owners as per the Alaska Constitution -- ""A CLEAR and EQUITABLE SHARE (ACES) of the value of their commonly-owned oil and gas.""  As a result, Alaska was left with a $12 billion surplus.

I urge all to watch this brilliant film and learn the truth about Sarah Palin.  Americans are a generous and an independent-minded people.  Don't let the machine and media establishment distort her great story.  If we want a better United States of America, we must elect people of character, honesty, integrity.  Watch the movie and decide for yourselves who are the villians and who are the heroes.",1314316800,133,2224,5.0576923076923075
4683116,5,B005FLSZNS,"THE UNDEFEATED documentary presents Sarah Palin as a fearless executive in action. Getting things done for Sarah is more important than playing politics. Interesting was her mayorship in Wasilla were she is pure substance, creating infrastructure, roads, sewers the stuff that attracts business...it's all about incentives, not taxing or regulating.

The executive authority of Alaska's governorship is great, making Sarah very powerful as the CEO of Alaska. The movie explains that w/ that elevated executive power & responsibility, Palin was very willing to use her veto pen & be held accountable, a novel idea, over 25,000 state employees. She takes on the entrenched Republican back-room big boys of Alaska & comes off as a real crusader against corruption not only in her own party but also among the domineering oil kings who she forced to develop oil they were sitting on. (Even today, she speaks clear common sense to the President & Congress' entrenched power mongers who want to keep treating the hardworking taxpayers like blissful suckers.)

The movie shows how important energy is to Alaska's lifeline by literally showing the bigness of it all...big pipes, big machinery, massive land masses for development, rich oil men...all this highlights Palin as a force to be reckoned w/ on the national level, as one who will indeed ""drill baby drill"" & face down a weak & indecisively wobbly Obama.

The director, Steve Bannon, brings up all the frivolous ethics complaints that led to her resigning the governorship & briefly addresses her selfless commitment to campaigning to turn around the House & Republican governorships in 2010...she didn't just sit on her laurels after she resigned.

The best part of the movie is when Sarah is talking...at the 2008 convention, in Wisconsin, a bit during her governorship...wish there was more of that...she just has the IT factor...pure charisma. The optimistic message of the movie is that it doesn't have to be government run amok, there really are devoted Sarah Palin like leaders out there who put ""we the people"" & the Constitution first.

The film is good ammunition to take back the narrative from a manipulative Pravda-media & a vindictively shallow popular culture bent on destructive smears & cheap shots against an honorable & serious woman. Instead, the film shows us a smart, hard working, fearless, determined & honest Mr. Smith goes to Washington type of LEADER that is heads above all the other candidates running for 2012. Sarah represents the life we wish we could live... purposeful, selfless, courageous. She seemingly has it all & is doing it the right way... being a paragon of the feminist ideal, to an inspirational force that makes us nostalgic for the founding fathers & Americana in all its patriotic, frontier-style glory.

While a 2-hour film can only focus on select areas of Sarah's career, it still shows that Sarah accomplished more in her 3 yrs as Governor than most Governor's do in their two terms, not to speak of the backward direction Obama has taken us along w/ his invisible resume. Sarah brought the GOP victory in 2010 w/ her endorsements & tireless campaigning, & her star, can-do power will rally the crowds for 2012. She's Obama's antithesis & can win.

Incidentally, bc/ Bannon spent his own million dollars doing the job the so-called MSM journalists should have done 3 years ago, of factually revealing Sarah's gutsy & solid record, the viewer is exposed to all new material covering Palin's 20 year political career. For that reason alone, whether the film is stylistic or not, or conforms to your particular bias, it's an interesting & informative movie for anyone who doesn't follow the mob & has individual critical faculty in formulating his own opinions.",1314316800,77,3761,5.076051779935275
4683117,5,B005FLSZNS,"I did not go into the movie as a ""fan"" - but an interested bystander.  I had watched Sarah quickly rise to fame and saw how the media instantly vilified her.  I didn't know what was ""true"" about Sarah, but I knew people felt passionately about her on both sides of the aisle.

What I learned in two hours was how easily the media can erase a person's identity and reset it to fit the desired outcome.  Governor Palin was highly respected, well regarded, and widely popular on both sides of the aisle in Alaska - but we in the lower 48 have come to believe from the media Palin is a right-wing extremist with a myopic view of the world, unrelenting and unable to create compromise.  Her RECORD in Alaska strongly proves otherwise.

I encourage everyone, regardless of political affiliation, to watch this movie.  If you don't want to buy it, rent it - also keep in mind that none of the proceeds go to Palin herself: so don't feel like you are ""supporting"" her by seeing it.

I am thankful I watched it.  And I hope it opens a few eyes to the reality of how the media paints the picture they want us to see - not the picture as it appears to the naked eye.  And this is media from both the conservative AND liberal perspective.",1314230400,204,1226,4.291304347826087
