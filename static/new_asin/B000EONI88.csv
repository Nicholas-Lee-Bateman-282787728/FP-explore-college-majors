8111975,2,B000EONI88,"Like another reviewer said, this was mainly footage of the Beatles arriving at various airports. I had a headache after I watched it, from listening to all the young girls screaming!
There are two Beatles DVDs with the same title ""The Beatles Around the World"". I had thought I was getting a concert DVD, but ended up with this one. Make sure to read the description carefully before buying. The DVD cover pictures are different too.",1254355200,3,433,4.7105263157894735
8111976,5,B000EONI88,"The picture quality is fantastic. I am a hardcore fan and I collect anything video related to the Beatles that I cna get my hands on. With that said, this is something I never seen before. This is from the boys 1964 tour of Australia. What the film is about is There arrival to the country. It is a TV news special. No songs or anything like that, but if you collect Bealts footage as I do you will want it in your collection. A nice piece to add if you have the 1964 Australian show as I do. Kind of takes full circle you might say.",1227225600,4,533,3.9906542056074765
8111977,1,B000EONI88,"I really don't know what to call this DVD.  It isn't a movie, or a documentary, or a short film.  It really doesn't fit any of those descriptions.

That's because it is basically just stock footage of The Beatles just getting off of planes.  There is nothing interesting about this.  Even a hardcore fan probably shouldn't waste their time with such garbage.

Don't buy it.",1179446400,7,373,4.661538461538462
