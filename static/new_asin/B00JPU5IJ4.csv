6388706,4,B00JPU5IJ4,"This landmark gay porn ""classic"" is more than forty years old!  Where did all those years go?  This is my first time with Wakefield Poole's much talked about movie and I must admit I was surprised how good it is and how it has survived the test of
time. A welcome rediscovery and in my case, discovery, of original gay porn which is still fresh and still hot.  Especially as we have been saturated ever since by all shapes and sizes and every possible variation of pornography and a lot nowhere near as good as this little epic.
I think key elements to the success of Poole's venture include the excellent location use of the Fire Island Pines with its mysterious boardwalks and isolated spots and the choice of blond ""god"" Casey Donovan (Cal Culver) being pitted against three very different sex partners: the bearded Peter Fisk, the swarthy Mediterranean Danny Di Cioccio and African-American Tommy Moore, who all perform with gay abandon. Also a plus is the beautiful outdoor cinematography even if a bit obscured by shadows etc. at times but considering how little the film cost, a remarkable achievement.  Also the use of a music soundtrack in preference to all those tiresome grunts, groans, sighs and inane f**k talk that have plagued many a porn flick.
The sex is pre-condom and pretty steamy with a variety of sexual activities that should satisfy most audiences.
There are a lot of extras on the disc including director's intro and audio commentary plus interviews and short doc on Revisiting Fire Island.  A deleted sequence which was intended to be the first segment is included and is evidence what a difference the replacement actor (Donovan) made to the overall effect of the finished product. Four short ""experimental"" films are also on the disc which will either intrigue or bore you but they clearly show the talent of Wakefield Poole.",1405296000,28,1853,4.832807570977918
8653100,2,B00JPU5IJ4,"I found this movie very hard to watch.  The cinematography is amateurish.  There are lots of scenes filmed in dappled shade, making very bright spots and very dark spots.  It's sometimes hard to tell what the actors are doing, and which end is up.  There are shaky camera shots, and times when the camera zooms in too fast or too slowly, making a few seconds of blur.  Yes it's a historic film, but Wakefield Poole's second film, ""Bijou'
is a far superior movie.
This practice film is over rated and over priced.  Wait until it goes in the $5 bin at Wally World.",1504224000,,562,4.407766990291262
8653101,5,B00JPU5IJ4,"A classic of gay porn or gay film making in general.  Hard core scenes (with good looking guys!) but with a bit of art film feel to it.  If you are interested in gay porn history, or just like watching it, and are curious about Wakefield Poole's films, you won't be disappointed. I enjoyed this one enough to have a look at other of Poole' work.",1484870400,,345,4.212121212121212

8653103,5,B00JPU5IJ4,Great to see what Fire Island looked like in the 70's.  Cal Culver is the personification of every gay man's dream.,1479340800,,115,4.476190476190476

8653106,4,B00JPU5IJ4,"There is only one Casey Donovan. In my eyes, the man was perfect. This erotic film is comprised of three segments. As much as I enjoyed the first two parts of the film, I can't begin to describe how erotic the final section is with the telephone repair man played by Tommy Moore. With dildo play by Donovan, the sex is scorching in this part of the movie. Just writing this makes me want to pop in the DVD and enjoy this experience all over again. Kudos to former Broadway choreographer, Wakefield Poole for conceiving and directing this classic which was on of the first hard core gay films played in the mainstream cinema.",1456617600,5,624,4.482456140350878
8653107,3,B00JPU5IJ4,"I bought this for ""historical"" reference, but have not actually viewed it. So I really can't say much about it. I was familiar with the importance of the persons of Casey Donovan and Wakefield Poole to the development of the gay entertainment in the 60's.",1447977600,,255,4.688888888888889
8653108,3,B00JPU5IJ4,"Considering the decade this film was written, and the available funds for it, The Boys in the Sand is a refreshing change to nasty, mindless porn. The scenes are delightfully prolonged. There is some semblance of a story. The cinematography is excellent. The sex is completely unrestrained. Best of all, Cal Culver (Casey Donovan) is stunning. I can't give it a better score as the piece is rather amateurishly done with little acting ability portrayed. In terms of a modern movie, Boys comes across as a bit hokey. But, if you're into male on male sex, I doubt you will find anything better. The interviews with Wakefield, the director/producer are enlightening. RIP Calvin Culver. You would have gone so much further.",1421539200,10,719,4.950413223140496
