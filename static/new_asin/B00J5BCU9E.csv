6333452,5,B00J5BCU9E,"I thought that the plot was a fresh take on modern relationships between men and women, as well as parents and adult children.  It was nice to see something where the women were supportive of one another and were confidently independent but not nasty.  The acting made it great, but the way it was filmed made me unsure if it was a movie, play, or sitcom.  I would love to see this as weekly show. It made me smile and generally feel good. Good Job!",1414281600,,449,4.258823529411765

6333456,4,B00J5BCU9E,I enjoyed this film. It was about three couples who fall in love. They wanted to get married and this film deals with the drama surrounding dating and planning a marriage. It was funny. The characters really loved each other and its nice to see comedies with African Americans showing them loving each other. It also deals with the topic of teen pregnancy and step parenting. These are important issues and they are handled with tact in this film. This is a family film and there is no profanity. It would be rated PG or PG-13. Highly recommended for fans of clean romantic comedies.,1406851200,2,583,4.615384615384615
