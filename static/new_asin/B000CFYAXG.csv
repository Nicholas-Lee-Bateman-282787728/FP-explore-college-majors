2463609,3,B000CFYAXG,"Filming was okay, several displays were flashy and stunning. Good enough if you just want to broaden your knowledge. Not  in depth but similar to ""flash cards"",",1361404800,,160,4.925925925925926
2463610,5,B000CFYAXG,"Simply put, this is an excellent survey of all the martial arts that come from the Korean peninsula.  From Taekwondo to Hapkido to Gyongdang and beyond, this little film gives the viewer a great idea as to the variety of Korean Martial Arts.

I'd endorse renting it, however.  One of those films best enjoyed once.",1236816000,3,314,4.672727272727273
2463621,1,B000CFYAXG,"Call it government propaganda or national pride, it's still lies. This video attempts to convince viewers that popular martial arts from Korea are native, when in fact most are NOT. If you look at the original Tae Kwon Do for example (I.T.F) or Tang Soo Do for that matter, the forms are nearly identical to Japanese Shotokan Karate. Granted, the Koreans added the round and high kicks, maybe even substituted thrust kicks with snapping ones, yet overall the forms are the SAME. Also, the origins of Hapkido can EASILY be traced DIRECTLY back to Japanese Aiki-Jutsu, just as Yudo reflects upon Japanese Judo. The reality is that during the Japanese occupation, the Koreans learned and kept Japanese arts. While some credit is deserved for the creative alterations, suggesting that Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido, etc. are native arts in origin is misleading.",1437609600,2,848,5.0212765957446805

2463624,4,B000CFYAXG,Very well done. I would have found a way to include Hwa Rang Do in the top 12.,1423353600,,78,3.388888888888889
2463625,4,B000CFYAXG,"Despite being involved martial arts for many years, I was only vaguely aware of the martial arts of Korea. This documentary provided an excellent overview, and I'm impressed with the diversity and richness of the arts that were shown. I also want to commend the filmmaker for acknowledging the roots of the various arts both inside and outside of Korea, and for avoiding the overt nationalism that sometimes pervades martial arts practitioners and organizations. From what I can see, Koreans have cause to be proud of their technical achievements, rigorous training, and sheer hard work, and at the same time the subjects of this film express surprising humility. Nicely done.",1411603200,2,676,5.154545454545454

2463629,4,B000CFYAXG,IF YOUR INTO MARTIAL ARTS worth a look see. Sort of a rudimentary overview of Korean martial arts. Maybe you learn something!,1390089600,,125,4.7272727272727275
2463630,4,B000CFYAXG,It is a good review of Korea's contribution to the martial arts heritage. This is good for students who wish to expand their martial arts knowledge.,1380931200,,148,4.730769230769231

8098841,3,B000CFYAXG,"While it was interesting to watch, I am a tad disappointed.  Aside from the normal arts such as TKD, TSD, and Hapkido, The two other best known Korean martial arts are Kuksoolwon and Hwa Rang Do.  So why is that Kuksoolwon made it to the list (although it should have been in the top 5) but Hwa Rang Do did not?  That was my only real complaint with it.",1454198400,,353,4.086956521739131

8098843,4,B000CFYAXG,"It's a quick over view of some Korean Martial Arts. No Tang Soo Do, no Hwa Rang Do. It cost me less than 5 bucks including shipping. As a side note, even adding the previews for other Turtle press DVD's it's not close to 70 mins. more like 60 mins.",1447804800,,248,3.98
8098844,2,B000CFYAXG,"This documentary is outdated, as in standard definition. It gives a very brief into to the history of Korean martial arts as well as weak descriptions of them. It may be helpful for a preteen school project.",1445731200,,207,4.621621621621622
