405910,3,6301978560,"Some people complain that this is a weak finale to the MGM Thin Man series.  It's true that some of the edginess and zest of the early entries in the series is missing, but even second string Nick and Nora is fun to watch.  Nick and Nora have settled into a more conservative, mid-life parenting mode.  Their son, Nick, Jr., is a chip off the old block.  Asta is still around, but plays second fiddle to Nick, Jr.  A society party on a gambling ship leads to murder.  A bonus of this film is an emphasis on jazz music (circa. 1947).  The hep cats, rootie-toots, and hot jive are a hilarious contrast to Nick and Nora's sophisticated demeanor.  The Charles's bewildered reaction to the ""Greetings, gate!  Let's coagulate!""  slang is priceless.  Sharp humor within the context of a happy marriage is a familiar trademark of the Thin Man series.  Nick and Nora have fun with their relationship.  Nick remains the sharp detective, albeit retired.  Nora is his intellectual and emotional equal.  Nora's chutzpah keeps her in the middle of Nick's cases with comic effect.  This movie will satisfy fans of the series, and anyone who enjoys mystery flavored with humor.  Don't spoil your enjoyment of this movie by searching for nuances.  Just dig that crazy jive, and enjoy this blast from the past.  ;-)",1038528000,23,1297,4.709821428571429
405911,3,6301978560,"While the previous THE THIN MAN GOES HOME was hampered by a very weak script, THE SONG OF THE THIN MAN actually has a decent script but lacks the energy and sparkle of the first four films in the series.  Even William Powell and Myrna Loy seem a bit tired of the whole thing, and this film finds their legendary chemistry reduced to the occasional twinkle.
The script is entertaining enough, concerning the murder of a band leader with ties to casino gamblers, and the supporting cast has a number of fine performances by the likes of Gloria Grahame, Jayne Meadows, and Keenan Wynn.  Most viewers will find it all reasonably entertaining, but the bloom is gone; newcomers to the 'Thin Man' series would do better to select one of the first four films in the series.",1009584000,13,765,4.576642335766423

406259,5,6301978560,"When MGM wanted to film a new installment in The Thin Man series, Myrna Loy, smart as usual, agreed only if it would be guaranteed to be the last one. By now it was 1947, thirteen years after the first film and with Loy in her forties and Powell in his fifties they were clearly getting too old to play the fun-loving, irreverent couple.  It must be said that though Powell had gained weight, Loy looked exactly the same as ever. Times had changed enough that their general insouciance was no longer unusual and their role as parents in the films did not fit well with Hammett's original characters.

In most ways this is really a four star film that is lifted out of the ordinary by the presence of the two principals and the fact that it is the last time we'll see Nick and Nora, which adds an extra star for me. This time they are back in New York City and are drawn into the world of  jazz musicians, clubs and all-night jam sessions. Keenan Wynn plays the friendly musician who guides them through this world which has its own hip vocabulary. This sets up a series of jokes based on Nick and Nora's unfamiliarity with the jargon but it doesn't work all that well because it ends up making them look like out-of-touch old fogies. The funniest moments include Nick sneaking aboard a ship to look for clues and Asta sneaking into bed with Nick Jr.

The supporting cast is excellent as is usual in these films. Gloria Grahame is a torch singer (dubbed for unknown reasons) who I wish had more screen time. Jayne Meadows is both charming and possibly menacing in her role of a society girl. Leon Ames had appeared in The Thin Man Goes Home and was to reprise the same character here but the name was changed when his wife in the previous film became unavailable. You'll recognize Connie Gilchrist as the Charles' maid, Bertha, the kind of role in which she specialized.

Overall there is less comedy than usual and the murder mystery dominates, another aspect that throws the balance off a bit. Nora is instrumental in solving the mystery. As usual, Nick manages to gather the numerous suspects together for his now familiar group cross-examination. The end is more violent than usual, but then the fifties were about to dawn and new film realities were already taking hold.

Though not quite up to the standard of the earlier films, as the finale of the series Song of the Thin Man is worth seeing even in its own right and as the finale of the series is a worthy if bittersweet experience for fans.",1479427200,8,2500,4.495594713656388

406412,3,6301978560,"Nick and Nora are aboard the gambling ship S. S. Fortune as part of a charity shindig, which features a show of jazz musicians. Tommy Drake is one musician who is ready to leave his employer at the ship to take a more lucrative tour-but the problem is that he also owes money to a group of gangsters aboard that ship, who give him until closing time to pay the money back. Begging a businessman for money, he is turned down-and is shot dead when he tries to get money out of a safe. Also, a rich man's daughter is eloping with one of the other musicians, to the father's disapproval.

The newly-married couple arrive the next day at Nick and Nora's home, as the husband, who fought with the now-murdered musician, is being sought by the police. Nick and Nora deliberately turn him in, though they believe him innocent, for his own safety, and investigate who the real murderer might be. It seems that Tommy Drake had quite a few other enemies...

This is the last movie in the Powell/Loy series; a lot of water had passed under the bridge and Powell was getting old for the part. There was also the joke about the couple's boy Nicky being older and somewhat naughtier now, as well as the idea of the couple being hopelessly square compared to all the hipster jazz musicians and their hipster slang. The story is convoluted too, and you don't get enough clues until the end. Worst is the idea of a jazz musician going insane and somehow being brought to normal for the final ""gathering"" scene on the reopened gambling ship.

Not all that bad, but it is just as well they stopped the series at this point.",1465689600,,1603,4.445578231292517

406482,4,6301978560,"I  see from the other reviews that this was the last of the Thin Man series. For those who want to see one of the classiest duos in film history winding down from their start in one of the most memorable films of the 1930's, this is well worth seeing. Yes, it is only a shadow of what it was in those early days, true, Nick Charles (William Powell) shows the passage of the dozen or so years since the beginning (while Myrna Loy seems still ageless), and, of course, much of the fizz in the champagne is spent, but, still, there is some of the former sparkle for those who know what they and it once were. For newcomers, perhaps, it will serve to induce them to revisit the 1934 original, while providing at least the pleasure to be obtained from the average 'Made for Television' movie.",1453593600,,787,4.3175675675675675

406624,3,6301978560,"It could have been titled, ""Swansong of the Thin Man"" as this was the 6th and final episode of Nick and Nora.  William Powell is still retired private eye Nick Charles and Myrna Loy is still his faithful wife Nora.  Asta is still their funny dog, although I'm sure this isn't the same one that started the series.  Their young son Nick, Jr. has a bigger role this time and is played by Dean Stockwell.

Nick and Nora are spending the evening on the S. S. Fortune, a floating casino.  Band leader Tommy Drake (Phillip Reed) is killed and it looks like the general manager, Phil Brant (Bruce Cowling) pulled the trigger.  After all, they had a bit of a row earlier.  But all is not what it seems as usual.  Brant and his girlfriend Janet Thayar (Jayne Meadows) ask Nick to get involved.  He declines as he always does and as he always does, gets interested and solves the case.

Edward Buzzell picks up the director's duties here.  I have to admit, the film was looking a bit tired, going through the motions it would seem.  Even the banter between Nick and Nora seemed to be lacking a bit.  And it amazed me how everyone seems to be fully awake and accepting visitors at 4 o'clock in the morning!  In addition to the aforementioned stars watch for Keenan Wynn as `Clinker' Krause, one of the band members who helps steer Nick in the right direction.  So concludes the great ""Thin Man"" series.

This is the final installment on the Thin Man series and the shortest of the six films. The Charles are on a ship call the S.S. Fortune for a charity event. You guessed it a murder happens while they are at the event. Nick it is at for one last time to find the murderer and clear up an innocence person. Yes the entire suspects are aboard the S.S. Fortune believing that Buddy Hollis is going to reveal the killer. In the end the killer confess to the crime unlike past three movies where Nick reveals the killer at a gathering. The movie has somewhat of a jazz theme to it. The two most notable actors in this film are Jayne Meadows and Dean Stockwell of Quantum Leap fame. This final install has lost all of its magic and the lead actors show their age in this movie. The funny lines are all but gone and the movie is more serious. I can only give Song of the Thin Man a C+.

406702,3,6301978560,"This movie was made the year I was born. So for someone who is accustomed to thinking of Keenan Wynn as a character actor who played crotchety old men with a raspy voice, seeing him young and playing a jazz musician is quite a change.

Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and Myrna Loy) go to a charity gambling party aboard a yacht in New York harbor. Predictably, there is a murder on board. There was a clarinet player who had been drunk and acting strangely who disappeared about the time of the murder, so they go in search of him. Along the way, a young woman is also murdered in a way that links her to the first one.

You know, it's hard to tell things about a murder mystery without giving things away. Let's just say wonder dog Asta plays a significant role in solving the mystery, but then he has done so in several of these movies. So does Nicky, Junior, played by Dean Stockwell.",1336694400,,894,4.315476190476191

406704,5,6301978560,"I got hooked on the Thin Man series watching TCM.  I purchased the entire collection on Amazon some years ago, and I continue to enjoy them to this very day.  They are classics for good reason.  The dialogue is classy, the plots are not insulting, and the cinematography is superb.  I also purchased several other films with William Powell as the lead actor--Growing up with Father.  Excellent movies!",1279152000,,401,4.838235294117647
406705,3,6301978560,"Most ""Thin Man"" fans agree that the series should have concluded with the previous title (1945's ""The Thin Man Goes Home""), but I think the appeal of having an even set of six movies was far too tempting for the MGM producers to ignore.  To be fair, there are a few sour notes, but the final adventure of Nick and Nora Charles in SONG OF THE THIN MAN (1947) is on the whole quite a fitting finale to this most delicious mystery series.

A night aboard the floating casino S.S. Fortune becomes more eventful for semi-retired detective Nick Charles (William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) when the bandleader is shot, and one of the main suspects subsequently goes AWOL.  Nick and Nora join forces with one of the wisecracking musicians (Keenan Wynn) in a race against time to find the killer...

SONG OF THE THIN MAN fails in many ways because the storyline is far too serious, almost noir-ish in tone; and most of Nick & Nora's witty asides and playful comedy scenes (which marked the earlier films) are nowhere to be found.  It's a dark new world for the Charles' and one can't help feeling that it's also the end of an era.

One thing that stands in SONG...'s favour however is an extremely fine cast...  Dean Stockwell (as Nicky Jr.), Jayne Meadows, Leon Ames, Gloria Grahame, Keenan Wynn, Patricia Morison and legendary bit-player Bess Flowers in one of her rare speaking parts.  It's probably the strongest cast ever assembled for a ""Thin Man""; and another reason why it's so frustrating that it doesn't function as fluidly as the earlier films.

In her autobiography ""Being and Becoming"", Myrna Loy expressed her misgivings about returning as Nora for the sixth time:
""[Song of the Thin Man] was a lackluster film from start to finish.  I hated it.  The characters had lost their sparkle for [William Powell] and me, and the people who knew what it was all about were no longer involved.  Woody Van Dyke [director of the first three movies] was dead.  Dashiell Hammett and [producer] Hunt Stromberg had gone elsewhere.  The Hacketts were writing other things.  Surprisingly though [it] was well received, particularly in England, where according to the Hollywood Reporter, ""Most of the cricks gave a cordial welcome to old-timers Bill Powell and Myrna Loy..."".  I know that only because Bill sent me the article with ""old-timers"" circled in pencil and this note scrawled at the top of the page: ""Dear old girl!  I know you wouldn't want to miss this!  Love, Willy (old boy)"".

For the fans, SONG OF THE THIN MAN will be a disappointment on many levels, but let's just sit back and enjoy the mystery at hand.",1260057600,,2620,4.706140350877193
406706,4,6301978560,"Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and Myrna Loy) are attending a gambling charity event aboard the S.S. Fortune.  The entertainment is being provided by a jazz band.  The band's leader, Tommy Drake (Phillip Reed) has huge gambling debts and too many female admirers.  So it is hardly surprising when he is shot before the cruise is over.

As always, Nick absolutely refuses to get involved.  That is until he is shot at.  With the case suddenly very personal, he and Nora infiltrate the hip world of 40's Jazz, guided by Clinker (Keenan Wynn).  Can Nick find the killer one last time?

The mysteries in this series have gotten weaker over time, and this one is no exception.  There was no way to figure out the killer before Nick.  Having said that, there are enough revelations and twists along the way to keep you entertained.

But the real reason to watch these films is the banter between Nick and Nora.  It's in top form here. I laughed and grinned plenty as the story progressed.  It's absolutely entertaining.  William Powell and Myrna Loy still have remarkable chemistry.

Of course, part of the laughs come from the fish out of water element with the jazz scene.  Keenan Wynn was absolutely hilarious in the role as the guide.  And it was fun for me to see him in a part outside of his Disney villain days.  Also fun was a very young Dean Stockwell as Nick Jr.

This movie is not the best from the franchise.  But it is a fun closer.  If you enjoyed the earlier films, don't hesitate to watch this one.",1250294400,,1515,4.516605166051661
406707,5,6301978560,A must have if you already own the other Thin Man movies and are a fan of William Powell and Myrna Loy.  Keenan Wynn is the treat in this movie.  Without his performance the movie would not hold up.  What a great actor he was.  In my opinion he steals the show.,1202256000,,261,3.9615384615384617
406815,3,6301978560,"Elsewhere in this space I have praised to the sky Dashiell Hammet's contribution to American literature through innovative improvements in the detective genre. That remains true. I have also praised the original film of the Thin Man here as well. But in the present review we are down to the sixth and last sequel in this series and it shows. Gone is the bright repartee between Nick (played by William Powell) and Nora (played by Myrna Loy) that made the original work. As the series progressed these characteristic charms took a beating until at the end the two are basically working separate beats.

The plot here involves a murdered small time jazz bandleader who has admirers (mainly female) but also some deadly enemies. Nick and Nora are drawn into this one by an acquaintance who has recently married a local gambling boss who, as the bandleader's employer, turns out to be a prime suspect. The fight for `truth and justice' takes off from there ending in the inevitable gathering of all the possible suspects in one locale in order for Nick to sort things out. The one redeeming feature here is the snappy `hip' dialogue of the various white jazz musicians who form the background for the story, especially the lively Keenan Wynn. Otherwise, this film-take it or leave.",1195776000,,1278,4.835616438356165
406816,4,6301978560,"Song of the Thin Man is the last film of the highly popular detective series starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles. Here, the couple is dragged into another murder case when a man is killed at a popular nighclub. It seems that he was involved with several women and owed a few debts. He could have been killed by anyone, and the evidence points to several people. Inevitably, just when the duo gets close to solving the case, something happens to throw them off course.

It is obvious that the leading stars have aged quite a bit since the first film in the series, but this is appropriate with the story. There are references to their longtime involvement in solving crimes, and their dog Asta has found a loving companion in the Charles son, Nick Jr. (Dean Stockwell). This is a movie about a family, which appeals to sentimental types, but it includes jazz and action for other audiences. There is certainly something for everyone here. No wonder this series ran for so long.",1186444800,,1003,4.603351955307263
406817,2,6301978560,"The film shows a gambling ship used for a charity event. The Charles' play and win at roulette. The band leader has an issue with the lead clarinet player. This band leader owes a pile of money ($12,000) that must be paid back soon - or else. A man enters a cabin to break into a locked chest. A gun shoots him. The murder of Tommy Drake makes front page news. At home Nicky Jr. must practice the piano, not play baseball. His refusal calls for a spanking.

Phil Brant is wanted for the murder. He just got married to a wealthy heiress. After they arrive at the Charles' the police show up to arrest him. Nick explains his reasons. So now Nick will investigate the murder. Nick visits the gambling ship to view the crime scene. [Note how a double is used for stunts and rough action.] The film shows musicians gathering for a good time. No drinking or smoking for these hep cats. Has a receipt for $12,000 gone up in smoke?

Mr. Thayer tells Nick about an antique gun. [This is not the revolver shown earlier!] There is a phone call that takes Mrs. Brant away. Nick deduces the address written on a paper pad. A clue brings Nick and Nora to Poughkeepsie NY. They find Buddy Hollis at a rest home; his mind is ""shattered"". Can anyone believe what he says? They discover a clue on the trip back home to Manhattan. Nick thinks up a ruse to expose the killer. [False clues have been spread around.] The suspects are all assembled on the gambling ship. There is a confession and a surprise ending. [Does it remind you of ""Murder, My Sweet""?]

This film is not as good as the earlier films. It is the last of the series, but a better story could have perhaps avoided this [unless that was its purpose]. This story seems to wander too much and waste the viewer's time. But its all right for fans of this series.",1184544000,,1804,4.331360946745562
406818,5,6301978560,"Starting with ""The Thin Man,"" William Powell and Myrna Loy were Nick and Nora Charles, Dashiell Hammett's greatest creation. This series stood apart from others in that it was a class ""A"" production all the way, MGM giving these wildly popular films their best contract players and their finest behind the scenes people to create something unparalleled in American film history.

The original ""The Thin Man"" was a masterpiece of light and witty comedy mystery that has never been equaled. For that reason it is unfair to compare the five films that followed with the first one, and once that is set aside, each of the five was charming, witty and classy, the perfect way to solve a mystery and be entertained at the same time. This was the last entry and was just teriffic, as ""The Thin Man"" went out in style.

Manhattan meets the hip jazz scene in this one as Nick and Nora are involved in solving another delicious murder, with nice touches from Nicky Jr. and, of course, their dog Asta. It begins when Nick and Nora have a night out on the gambling ship ""S. S. Fortune.""

The film opens with a young and stunningly beautiful Gloria Grahame singing ""Your Not That Easy to Forget"" and only gets better. As Nick and Nora rub shoulders with the elite and a few of Nicky's old pals a chain of events leads to murder, discovered the next morning when the chief suspect stops by with his fiance to ask for Nick's help. Nick turns him over to the cops for his own safety when he is shot at but the deal is sealed when the bullet hits a bottle Nick had been saving for a special occasion, and as he puts it, ""An old friend of mine went completely to pieces.""

There are no shortage of suspects as Nick and Nora start nosing around, aided by a young Keenan Wynn as one of the hip band members. It's very funny as Nora begins to pick up the lingo of Wynn and his jazz friends, who seem to have a language of their own. The victim seemingly had no end of enemies. He was deep in debt to a dangerous gambler, had been cheating on his girlfriend, was running out on a contract to play at the ""S. S. Fortune"" for greener pastures, had publicly humiliated Grahame's former boyfriend Buddy Hollis (Don Taylor), and more.

Before it's over, Nick and Nora will walk in on another murder, and Nick will stage a suprise back on the waters, gathering all the suspects back on the swanky ""S. S. Fortune"" to trick a killer. Patricia Morison, Jayne Meadows, Dean Stockwell, Ralph Morgan, William Bishop and Marie Windsor all offer fine support to make this closing chapter one of their best. Some nice family moments (Nick and Nora style) with Asta and Nicky Jr. are put in the mix as well, Nicky Jr. seemingly a chip of the old block.

The same carefree and fun loving ambiance that was a staple of every entry is here and a good atmospheric mystery to boot. There is nothing shabby about ""Song of the Thin Man."" It is a bar that many have attempted to reach when making a light comedy mystery but these films have endured because of their wit, fun and charm. Nothing has ever come close to them and you won't want to miss this one!",1180051200,6,3112,4.403478260869565

406820,4,6301978560,"""Song of the Thin Man"" (1947) is the third-best film in the ""Thin Man"" series, after the original ""The Thin Man"" (1934) and ""After the Thin Man"" (1936). Typical of the ""Thin Man"" movies, there is no shortage of suspects or red herrings, and the case is solved when Nick Charles brings everyone together at the end to sweat the solution out of them. Screenwriters Steve Fischer and Nat Perrin and director Edward Buzzell are all newcomers to the franchise, but this mystery is one of the best. Tommy Drake (Philip Reed), bandleader and inveterate gambler, is shot to death aboard a gambling ship owned by Phil Brant (Bruce Cowling). Tommy was in debt to a bookie, just had a fight over a woman with his unstable reed man, announced he was taking his band and leaving Phil for greener and richer pastures, and was disliked by everyone. But the police blame Phil Brant, who has just married the blue-blooded Janet Thayer (Jayne Meadows) against her father's strong objections. Janet and Phil turn to their friends Nick and Nora Charles (Myrna Loy and William Powell) in desperation, hoping that Nick can crack the case and clear Phil's name.

The ""Thin Man"" franchise is in its 13th year at this point, and Nick and Nora Charles are looking very much the middle-aged couple with a son (Dean Stockwell), who is increasingly like his father, in grade school. Nick doesn't seem to drink anymore. And Nora is no longer a fashion plate. I like the fact that this film admits they are not young. It would be ridiculous if it didn't. Nick's sleuthing takes the couple into the world of jazz musicians, who speak a hipster lingo that befuddles Nick and Nora, poking fun at the generation gap. Newlyweds Janet and Phil are a younger version of the Charleses, an aristocratic woman who married an ambitious street-wise working stiff, who look to the older couple for understanding. Two actresses who became staples of film noir in the years to come have small roles: Gloria Grahame is ""canary"" and suspect Fran Page, and Marie Windsor plays a bookie's wife. Nick's method of eliciting a confession is more far-fetched than usual, and that seemed like a flaw to me. But ""Song of the Thin Man"" is one of the most entertaining mysteries in the series. As Nick says to an anxious Nora: ""We're on no spot that the solution of the crime won't get us off.""

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005): Bonus features include a short film, a cartoon, and a theatrical trailer (3 min). ""A Really Important Person"" (11 min) is a John Nesbitt ""Passing Parade"" short film starring Dean Stockwell as an 8-year-old boy who is looking for someone important to write about for an essay contest and finally decides that that person is his father. ""Slap Happy Lion"" (7 min) is a cartoon about a formerly ferocious and fearless lion who is now afraid of a particularly self-assured and pesky mouse.",1142899200,,2854,4.706
406821,2,6301978560,"I loved the earlier THIN MAN movies. The chemistry between Nick and Nora was cute and new at the time the films originated. Nick, the former police detective, who loved to drink but had the deductive capabilities of Sherlock Holmes. Nora was the adventurous rich girl who proved to be more than a match for her street smart husband. This formula worked very well during the early movies but by the time SONG OF THE THIN MAN was released the magic was gone.

Now Nick, & Nora are now parents of Nick Jr. played by Dean Stockwell (QUANTUM LEAP's Rear Admiral Albert 'Al' Calavicci)and both clearly showing their middle age wear and tear. All the interplay between Nick and Nora seems old and tired. Nick continues to use his street connections to try and generate clues while Nora still seems to be curious about Nick's detective powers. Nick, as always, rounds up all the suspects and as everybody, except the criminal who must not be familiar with Nick's modus operandi, knows he reveals the criminal and saves the day. I should have listed this as a spoiler but anyone familiar the THIN MAN movies will know how the film ends. The only mystery is who did it and not how it will be revealed.

I love THE THIN MAN movies. I really enjoyed THE THIN MAN GOES HOME. However the series should have ended there. SONG OF THE THIN MAN was an obvious attempt to wring a little more money out of the franchise. Even though I'm not a big fan of the film I do hope it and all the other THIN MAN movies are released on DVD.",1083024000,5,1510,4.408602150537634

Keenan Wynn has an important role as a member of the band. Edward Buzzer is the director.
The film marked the sixth and final entry in the THIN MAN Series. William Powell and Myrna Loy held the starring roles of Nick and Nora Charles in all of the movies.
