7790460,5,0783234856,"that this show has been airing on TV for a decade.  Each episode is better than the one before (and EVERY episode is good!) transporting the viewer  from crime scene to courtroom, the scriptwriting, and taut, controlled  production is second to none, and each cast member, including the guest  stars and cameos, brings his or her character to life, openly revealing  little of their character traits unless confronted by a situation which  forces them to do so.
In years to come, people will regard ""Law  And Order"" as a television classic.  More than just a cop show, more  than just a courtroom drama, this is a show which reveals the dark side of  humanity as well as the justice system - people commit terrible acts upon  their fellow man, people make mistakes, in some cases justice doesn't  triumph but in some cases it does - that will provoke deep thought in the  viewers long after the final screen credits have rolled.",967161600,18,928,4.6894409937888195
7790461,5,0783234856,"The 10-year old NBC series is on the way to becoming one of the medium's best-produced dramas in television history.  This six-episode set  exemplifies why the show has garnered critical and viewer approval.  Always  willing to take chances and draw subject matter from the headlines,  ""Law & Order"" tackles the controversial with expertly crafted  stories and superb acting from its various principals and guest stars.
It  has been said that producer Wolf feels that the stories are the key to the  show's success, spending very little time delving into the personal lives  of the main characters.  However, the brief glimpses afforded by the  ""off the cuff"" remarks and their reactions to the crimes and  their jobs allow the viewer to make judgments about the  individuals.
Featuring a diverse cast, the set offers a chance to see how  the actors tackle their characters with skill and emotion.  It is indeed a  pleasure to watch the passionate Ben Stone, as played by Michael Moriarty,  in the courtroom as he endeavors to present the state's case.  Sam  Waterston, with his expressive face and masterful delivery, is a lesson in  the fine art of acting.  S. Epatha Merkerson, as Lt. Anita Van Buren, is a  no-nonsense, take-charge dynamo with absolute control. In one fine  installment, Chris Noth as Det. Mike Logan makes a revelation that shows  the reason for his intensity regarding that particular case.  Richard  Brooks fares well in his role of Assistant DA Paul Robinette.  Jill  Hennessy is genuinely sincere in the role of Claire Kincaid, assistant to  the DA.  Steven Hill, as Adam Schiff, gets all the best lines as the  ""elder statesman"" of the cast.
However, the fantastic Jerry  Orbach illuminates the screen as the sardonic, experienced Lennie Briscoe,  one of the best detectives ever to grace the small screen.
Although all  six episodes are outstanding, the best are  ""Conspiracy,""  ""Sanctuary,"" ""Manhood,"" and ""American Dream.""  The  first two have similarly themed stories based on strained race relations.  Both feature bravura acting from guests Joe Morton, Gloria Foster, Eric  Bogosian, Michael Jayce, Tony Todd, and Michael Constantine.  Lorraine  Toussaint is captivating as defense attorney Shambala Green. ""Manhood""  tells a tale of prejudice among the ranks of New York's finest against  gays.  The ending of that one is a true indictment against our  society.
However, the best acting job goes to Zeljko Ivanek in a the role  of an egomaniacal murderer who plays a cat-and-mouse game with Stone in  ""Dream.""  His performance is worthy of an Emmy and is one that  will remain with the viewer.",965433600,29,2627,5.080188679245283
7790462,5,0783234856,"Even though most of todays TV shows lack in reality and just about everything else needed to make a great series, Law and Order is one of those rare instances in television where quality is top priority.  Strong  writing and acting all around, it's no wonder why Law and Order has been  around for ten years.",959385600,3,308,4.464285714285714
