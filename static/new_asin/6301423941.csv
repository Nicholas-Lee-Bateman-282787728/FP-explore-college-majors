327672,5,6301423941,"Excellent old fashion Western from back in the days when the writting was good and gritty and the stars were real and yet larger than life.  Unlike the inflatable big headed morons we get today, like Mr. Cruise and Mr. Pitt.
Charleton Heston  Rules the screen with a simple yet strong present.  He is no pretty boy.  His rugged face make you belive he did that kind of work regardless of the role instead sitting around all day getting manicure/pedicures and living a ""FAKE"" religion as tax/mental healt permanant commital dodge.  Watah any of his performances and you will see why he won several Oscars simply because he EARNED THEM WITH HARD WORK and not through being a popular pretty boy.  The rest of the cast is awesome and believable as well.",1213747200,13,749,4.636363636363637
327673,4,6301423941,"Any film with Jack Palance as the villain is intense and strong... This great actor is unique and classic in this respect!

His order to his braves: 'There will be no more fighting until Bannon has met Toriano!,' marks a summary of the entire motion picture: Toriano against Bannon!

But who are these two men?

Ed Bannon (Charlton Heston) is the Chief of Scouts for U.S armed forces fighting Apaches in the post Civil War... He despises Apaches: 'Anything Toriano for, I'm against!'

Toriano (Jack Palance) is the son of the Old Apache Chief Chattez (Frank Dekova). He rejects permanent confinement and refuses to accept how his warriors are gathered like cattle in their reservation...

Apache Wars were among the fiercest fought on the frontier... The U.S government attempted to limit their territories and movements...

In the film we learn that an Indian cannot touch, harm or kill a man if he comes unarmed into their encampment; an Apache leader can be mystified through the Great Spirit by ritual drum beat; when an Indian and a white man are blood brothers, the only way to break the bound was for one of the two to die-- This explains why Toriano and Bannon assigned the time and place to meet in a single combat to death at the end of the picture...

The pretty Katy Jurado is Bannon's lover, a young girl, half Indian, half Mexican, who admires Toriano as a true leader...Wanting to serve him, she keeps an eye on Bannon, spying all his moves...

Shot in Technicolor, with good directing and strong supporting cast (Brian Keith in his film debut), ""Arrowhead,"" overcomes as a good-looking Western by the excellent acting of its stars...",1163030400,25,1649,4.78169014084507
327674,3,6301423941,"Not in ARROWHEAD you don't, lessen you're one of those dunderheaded fools who reckon we can trust, and live in peace with, the bloodthirsty heathens.  Charlton Heston plays the moody Chief of Indian Scouts, Brian Keith the young and nave commander of a small unit of cavalry isolated out on the west Texas border sometime in the 1870s, and Jack Palance is college-educated Apache who comes back to the reservation with revolt, and personal glory, on his mind in ARROWHEAD, a cowboys-and-indians western from 1953.

  A cowboys-and-indians western with an attitude, it should be noted.  Not all that pleasant an attitude, either.  The US Government, through Keith, wants to parlay with the Apaches.  Heston, who grew up with `em and can read a pony trail or a smoke signal like a native, will have none of it. To Heston - and the movie, because Heston is never proven wrong - the Apaches are treacherous, back-stabbing fiends whose perfidious ways are etched in their genes.  He's not a hater, though.  In fact, at one point he clears that point up by saying  ""I don't hate `em, I know `em.""  Put that in your peace pipe and smoke it!  My favorite line in this odd movie, though, is again uttered by Heston when a character he was on intimate terms with dies (after unsuccessfully trying to stab him in the back) by her own hands when she turns her knife on herself.  You'd think this movie would be the least little curious about what motivated this sequence of events beyond the ""Apache blood"" excuse it uses throughout, but no.  So, fresh corpse on the floor, fresh corpse of a recently intimate acquaintance, and the movie has Heston say, with undisguised disgust, `There's a dead Apache in here.  Get it out.'  It's amazing to think that this one came out AFTER ""Broken Arrow,"" the landmark Jimmy Stewart/Delmer Daves film from 1950 that is usually credited with opening up movies to a sympathetic treatment of Native Americans.

  A trend that wasn't stemmed much by this pretty much forgotten little oater.  If you can get past the movie's mean and narrow point of view it's an alright actioner.  Heston plays it with cool authority, gets to keep a couple of fort women on the string, and plumbs absolutely none of the psychological depths his Apache-raised character is filled with (to be fair, the movie doesn't seem much interested in whatever conflicts his character is experiencing, either.)  Jack Palance, one of the more sinister actors in movie history, is very effective as the war-minded Apache.  Recommended with (no pun intended) strong reservations.",1162512000,11,2568,4.839449541284404
327675,2,6301423941,"Heston is grumpy and Palance hateful Indian with a grudge. This seemed like a movie that was made because the actors didn't have a job at the moment and the script was there.

The actors I like but the movie misses. However, in the era it was made we would watch anything so perhaps it filled its purpose.

I'm sure Katy J. and a the entire cast was happy when the filming was over and would like to forget they made the movie.

Arrowhead is in my Heston movie library, however...just for the historical flow of Heston movies.",1113609600,2,526,4.346938775510204
327676,2,6301423941,"Charlton Heston stars as Ed Bannon in a role the NRA would be proud of.  Ed has a fierce hatred for the Apache Indian which dates as far back as his childhood.  The movie starts out with Ed killing some go-between Indians who come in peace to relay a message that the tribe is surrendering.  Ed belongs to the US Army and is kicked out for the aforementioned action by Captain Bill North, played by Brian Keith.  Keith does a great job in his role, at times sounding like John Wayne but never carrying it out quite as coolly or confidently.
Captain North and his men are tasked with taking the Apaches to an Indian reservation in Florida.  However, it?s not going to be so easy thanks to Apache Toriano, played by Jack Palance.  The Captain thinks he and his men can pull off this feat without much trouble, but can they, without help from Bannon?  After all, he's lived with the Apache and knows how they think.
This film doesn?t really have any good nor bad characters although at the time it came out the Apaches were the bad guys, why else would they cast Palance as Toriano?  It?s an interesting film from a historical perspective (film history, not actual history) but much finer ""cowboy"" vs. Indians have been created.  In today?s world the movie?s very un-PC, but weren?t most early films starring Native American bigoted in some way?",1068508800,8,1342,4.558333333333334

327720,4,6301423941,"Both Charlton Heston and Jack Palance performed well in this film which is based on a true story. We are told at the outset that the Charlton Heston character deserved the Congressional Medal of Honor; then the film tells us why. He is a white man who was raised by the Apaches and hates them with a passion. The US government and its army are convinced that the Apaches want peace, but he says the Apaches are lying. Needless to say, he is right, even though most of the army commanders think otherwise.
Jack Palance plays the son of an Indian chief who is also passionate, but he assumes the role of a traditional figure that says an Indian will appear who is invincible and will lead all the tribes to victory over the whites.
One flaw that bothered me is that both leading characters were overly passionate. There was no nuance, no subtlety.",1486598400,,845,4.4935064935064934

The history of the Apache wars and Al Sieber (the character Banyon) was quite different and this was a complete joke as far as those aspects,, on all accounts!
The character of toriano? Played by Jack Palance was I think, suppose to represent someone like Geronimo. Not even close,, and no apache would go east to school and come back as a full fledged warrior on return, with long hair,,laughs!. The only Chiricahua apaches that went east were sent there in a boxcar, to florida and oklahoma prisons, and died there.  There was no ""Ghost Dance"" with the apache people,,, that was Lakota and other's. There were similar beliefs of ancestors returning but it wasn't called the ghost dance, which was started by a piute man named Wovoka! In the movie one of the officers scolded Banyon (Al Sieber) for not fighting at Gettysburg and wearing confederate pants. Al Sieber who was a german immigrant ""did fight at gettysburg"" and with the north! Al Sieber WAS NOT raised by apaches at all! He learned how to be a superb scout through other scouts and personal experience. He had sort of a love hate relationship with the scouts under him particularly ""The apache Kid"" who he took under his wing as a young man, but later turned on and made false testimony against! The Apache people were  superb guerilla fighters and trackers and an awesome people whose lands were taken and who suffered many injustices at the hands of the white eyes, blue coats, and miners, as well as the general white population. They tried to frame Cochise and they killed one of the greatest chiefs, Mangus Colorado because he wanted to trust them and went for a 'Parley"" against the advice of his fellow tribal members. The supposed peacemakers arrested him and because he was such a large person cut off his head and boiled it so they could send it to be studied! Need I go further? These early movies are like the history books that portray indians as uneducated savages and thats all. They have to be taken with a large grain of salt! The only similarities between Al Sieber and Banyon are maybe the hat. Oh and one other thing..In the scene where Toriano has a group of bluecoats trapped in some trees. They show the Apache warriors making a frontal assault in a straight line, perhaps better suited to the british red coats,,,  not apaches who never fought that way, but used stealth and camouflage. That was really laughable! I would still watch the movie just for the landscape and a work of pure fiction!",1416182400,3,2588,4.631808278867102

327847,4,6301423941,"Although not a masterpiece, this is nevertheless an interesting and highly original western - and I liked it a lot. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

The film begins with a short skirmish between two army scouts, including Chief Scout Ed Bannon (Charlton Heston), and two Apache warriors. This incident is considered as extremely unwelcome by local US Cavalry commanders, as it seems that most of Apache tribes are now looking for a peaceful settlement. Local settlers are weary of years of war and are ready to go to great lengths to achieve peace.

In fact, mixed blood half-Apaches, like a smoking hot girl named Nita (Katy Jurado) and her brother Spanish (Peter Coe) live already amongst the whites. Some young Apaches went also to white man schools to be educated and help build bridges between communities. The greatest hope for everybody in those lands is Toriano (Jack Palance), a very gifted and charismatic young man, son of an influent Apache chief, who obtained a scholarship and went to the college in East. Having recently graduated he is now due to come back, to the greatest joy of his fellow tribesmen but also many whites, many of whom were raised together with him (one of them is even his blood brother)...

But there is a shadow on this idyllic picture. Chief Scout Ed Bannon doesn't buy it all. He believes that this whole recent period of calm is just silence before the storm and all gestures of good will shown by Apaches are just a game. Bannon claims that Apaches are in fact preparing a major rebellion, one which will unite more tribes than ever before - and he even believes that fully  assimilated and well educated (in fact better educated than Bannon himself) Toriano is the brain behind all this master plan...

Bannon, a highly experienced scout and veteran of many fights, who himself lived many years amongst the Apache and knows their language and customs, seems on the surface of things as somebody whose advice should count. But as what he says goes against the desires of local population and authorities, both military and civilians, absolutely everybody is outraged and incensed by what is considered as ""warmongering"".

It must be said, that Bannon is not a very nice fellow - to put things mildly... He has a short temper and bad  manners, he completely lacks diplomacy and he also has the reputation of mistreating women, especially his half-blood mistress, Nita. Many cavalry soldiers also dislike him because he used to be a Confederate officer As nobody is as blind as those who refuse to see, when Bannon discovers some evidence supporting his views, paradoxically it makes things even worse for him - he gets assaulted and beaten... Ultimately cavalry commanders order him to step down for a time from his functions and stay away from Indians, to avoid any further incidents, which could jeopardize peace process.

All this covers like the first ten minutes - and then the film REALLY begins and about the rest I will say no more...
This film is an adaptation of the novel ""Adobe walls"" by W. R. Burnett, an American novelist who wrote many books adapted later to the screen, including ""Little Caesar"", ""The beast of the City"", ""High Sierra"" and ""Asphalt Jungle"". He also later wrote the scenario for ""The Great Escape"".

The title of the book was quite appropriate, as adobe walls are indeed fragile  and can collapse easily The title of the film however doesn't seem to have much to do with anything on the screen  except if one can consider Toriano as the sharp business end of the whole arrow made of hundreds of Apaches

The character of Ed Bannon was supposedly inspired by that of Al Sieber, a real life famous scout who after fighting for the North in War Between States served later under general Crook in Apache Wars  but after reading a short biography of Siebert I really couldn't find ANY significant similarities, except for the fact that both are scouts and fought against Indians.

This film is sometimes criticised for a very negative perception it gives of the Apaches (both full blooded and half-breeds), as it shows them as scheming, treacherous and especially EXTREMELY violent and cruel. Well, after reading some books about Apache Wars, I must say that I believe this film portrays them EXACTLY as they were  essentially very warlike Palaeolithic nomadic hunter-gatherers, who despised all peaceful trades like farming or cattle raising and based a large part of their economy and culture on raiding, looting and enslaving their less violent neighbours.

Well before any white people came, Apaches were already a scourge of those Indian tribes which opted for more sedentary and less warlike lifestyle  and it had consequence for their whole social life. Warlike nomadic populations which adopt predatory comportments are usually very proud, fierce and arrogant and tend to use cruelty as ways to scare and impress their prey. Furthermore, in those kind of societies the use of deceit, schemes and betrayal is also considered as a perfectly honourable way to act against ""lesser"" nations  which means all those with which such a group is currently at war

To finish with the subject of deceit and treachery  although viciously cruel and violent, the Apaches were however fighting for their own land during their wars against USA and Mexico governments and as they couldn't match American and Mexican armies firepower, I can hardly blame them for using guerrilla tactics, ""ruses de guerre"", infiltration, double-agents and occasional perfidy

That being said, I believe in this film the Apache are just a tool used to make a larger demonstration. The novel ""Adobe Walls"" was written in 1953, when Korean War was still raging. Because of that  everybody still remembered how badly United States wanted peace after 1945 and how quickly the country disarmed  just to be taken completely by surprise when Stalin send his North Korean stooge against South Korea in 1950

I believe that both the novel and the film address actually two issues revealed by Korean War. The first one is the voluntary blindness to the gathering clouds of war of people who, tired of fighting, desperately want peace. But to achieve peace it takes BOTH sides  and if one is really committed to wage war, then there WILL BE war, no matter what conciliatory measures the other one takes The second issue is an aggressive and hostile reaction to people who say uncomfortable truths, which disturb the peace of mind of majority  especially when those seemingly wolf-crying naysayers are not very popular or for that matter very likeable to begin with And yet, even the nastiest @holes can sometimes be right  and even if there is no reason nor obligation to like them, it can be not such a bad idea to at least check if they are not on to something real after all

For all reasons mentioned above I consider ""Arrowhead"" as a very, very interesting film with a much deeper and complex scenario than one can think. I must however admit, that the very ending is anti-climactic and surprisingly weak  and therefore I cannot rate this film more than four stars. Still, it is a recommended viewing and I will keep preciously my DVD. Enjoy!",1401235200,6,7193,4.868140868140868

Toriano, the son of an Apache chief, is aptly played by Jack Palance. When Toriano returns from an Eastern education,  Bannon is suspicious of his motives and their mutual distrust makes for a very exciting western.",1395619200,,466,4.716049382716049

The action vs. storyline sequences are mixed in such a manner as to keep the film from dragging or being dull at any point. Probably more of a guy's movie, though several of the key actors involve male stars who were quite popular with the ladies at the time this movie was released.

This movie is presented in Full frame, color and runs for about 105mins (1hr and 45mins). This movie stars; Charlton Heston, Jack Palance, Katy Jurado, Brian Keith, Mary Sinclair, Robert J. Wilke and was Directed by, Charles Marquis Warren.

327895,5,6301423941,"Al Sieber - Chief of Scouts was a northern war hero in the War for Southern Independence and the ensuing Indian wars. Charlton Heston, my NRA hero, (I forgive him for this grossly inaccurate atrocity,) plays Sieber in the movie, ""Arrowhead."" 1953: The character ""Ed Bannon"" portrayed by Charlton Heston in the film Arrowhead was based on Sieber.

One glaring historical inaccuracy in the movie has Bannon in a Confederate uniform. This is grossly inaccurate. Confederates didn't fight the Apaches or any other Indians. Indians fought on the side of the Confederacy during the War, so why would Confederates suddenly turn on the Indians and murder them to enrich Lincoln's newly formed dictatorship. As usual Yankee authors love to portray Confederates and Southerners in the most negative light possible.

If I were Yankee I would complain about the way Sieber is portrayed in the Confederate uniform too. Yankees think Sieber was such a great man and want to claim him as their very own hero. I say let the Yankees have him. I'm not one bit pleased with a man who fought Indians, killed Indians, murdered Indian women and children, and drove the Indians from their lands. And please stop trying to make a Confederate out of Sieber, the Indian killer.

I give this movie a zero for historical accuracy. But Southerners should see this movie to learn how northern authors and Hollywood libatards distort the truth about the South, the War and all things Southern.",1340236800,2,1462,4.934959349593496

SYNOPSIS--
Despite the opinion of Capt. Bill North (Keith) and reassurance from Chattez that the Apache tribe will freely surrender for transport to Florida, Ed Bannon is convinced otherwise. This Apache-hater fervently believes the chief's son, Toriano (Palance) has returned from an Eastern school not to oversee his peoples' removal from ancestral lands but to fulfill a false prophesy and lead an uprisng against the 'White Eyes.'

Shot in the rural Texas area where these events originally unfolded, ""Arrowhead"" is a fine cavalry/Indians saga that's enhanced by superior Technicolor cinematography, solid acting from its principals and a fast-moving script. Despite claims that this perennially underrated picture broadly stereotypes and thus denigrates the red man, taken solely as entertainment it's a darn good piece of work! Recommended for all western, American history and action/adventure fans.

7811472,2,6301423941,"Charlton Heston does his best to imitate John Wayne and its standard fare from the 50s when the studios opted not to use Native Americans. Ignoring the history of the time suffice it to say that pretty much everything was bad in this one acting, scenery, dialog, casting and even the fort without a wall. The love interest of two of the male stars looks old enough to be their mother. Some of the cacti looked pretty good and for all the fierceness fighting prowess of the tribe they were pretty easy to sneak up on. I grew up watching a lot of these movies when they were in the theaters and they did do much better on those huge screens but this is one of the more lame efforts form those times. Bannons hatred of the Apaches is never really explained and hes pretty much an unlikable character with no reason given. It would have made more sense that he hated the whites and preferred the company of the Apaches since the movie was based loosely on a real person. This was much more like an F-Troup tries to get serious and the Calvary dressed the part perfectly and Bannon never seemed to change his clothes once. Anyway, no rousing Calvary action is this one and no matter how much color you spread over Toriano will make you believe hes anything but Jack Palance. We read a lot of reviews on this one and cant match them up with the movie but we didn't hit the back button but since it was late and this was our last movie we stayed with it.",1507420800,,1447,4.2846715328467155
