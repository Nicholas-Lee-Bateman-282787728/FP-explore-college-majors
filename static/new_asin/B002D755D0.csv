You didn't do a good job.

Great Job!",1246838400,28,175,3.9714285714285715

How to do 2 guys release year after year of garbage and keep getting renewed. That's where they really do a great job, staying in business without talent.",1305417600,,264,4.760869565217392

8364888,4,B002D755D0,"While the shipping wasn't that great (couple damaged cases, one DVD had been jarred loose), I absolutely love the show. I only took a star away for the bad shipping method.  I have gotten many laughs from this collection and will be purchasing season 4 from Amazon.
