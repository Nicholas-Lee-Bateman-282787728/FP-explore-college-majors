4505615,5,B004Z6N7HS,"This was an excellent film, with fantastic acting and an incredibly shocking and important message. Cringing at the treatment of little girls to prepare them for womanhood and marriage, I felt such horror and anger at those that carry this barbaric ceremony on in the believe that the girls should be grateful and happy about having their sexual organs ripped out of them.
The film should be seen, and the message acted upon. There is information about the Waris Dirie Foundation available on the internet. It's a cause that I could never turn my back on.",1314403200,,555,4.791666666666667
4505616,4,B004Z6N7HS,"The movie is about the life story of a girl who was borned in the poorest regions of one of the poorest countries in Africa, and who eventually becomes a top model.  How many times do you see that happen?

That is an amazing story in itself, but there is an educational and disturbing element to this movie.  It is the practice of mutilating female genitalia of girls at a very young age as part of their customs.  It really is very sad to see a practice like that going on as we speak.

Yes, I do recommend this movie, but it is not jovial, and it may be disturbing to some people.",1314057600,,582,4.115044247787611

4505618,4,B004Z6N7HS,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- The story of Waris Dirie presented in this film is both true and extraordinary. However, an extraordinary true story does not always produce an extraordinary film. Desert Flower comes close at times, but continually finds ways to undercut itself. There are scenes of intense emotional power and unflinching reality presented in the film, but they sit uncomfortably alongside scenes of biopic convention and unpersuasive fairy tale sentiment.

While I think it's important to avoid the distinction between scenes containing intense content and scenes that are actually high-caliber, Desert Flower's strongest moments are indeed its bleakest. The scenes that will remain in the memory long after the film concludes are those dealing with Waris' circumcision, particularly an excruciating sequence in which we watch her 3-year-old face as the procedure is performed. It's an angry, damning indictment of a barbaric process. Another painful yet tender moment occurs between Kebede and Hawkins, as the latter begins to realize what has been done to the former. These are scenes that tower above some of tiresome trivialities the film engages in during its weaker moments.

So, the subject matter is there and the cast delivers. What Desert Flower needed was a steadier hand at the wheel.

Desert Flower arrives on hi-def sporting a very attractive 1080p/1.85:1 transfer. The level of detail is spectacular throughout, flesh tones are warm and natural and the film's barren African locations look visually stunning and yet forbidding (the London locations are a bit less striking, but the marvelously expressive faces of actors like Spall and Hawkins are enough to compensate for that). Audio is equally excellent, with clean dialogue, immersive sound design and a well-mixed but occasionally overbearing original score. An early scene in a nightclub will give your speakers quite a workout, but it's noticeably louder than anything else in the film. Supplements include an interview with Kebede (17 minutes) and a trailer.

4505621,4,B004Z6N7HS,"[The following review contains minor spoilers.]

""Desert Flower"" is a cinematic adaptation of an autobiography of the same name by Waris Dirie, a Somali model-turned-human rights activist. To escape an arranged marriage, 13-year-old Waris Dirie runs away from her mother's home. She eventually moves to London, where she is spotted by a photographer Terence Donovan. Waris Dirie has been also active in raising awareness about FGM or female genital mutilation, which she herself underwent as a child.

The bio-pic film starts with Waris Dirie (Liya Kebede), a Somali immigrant living on the street of London, who is mistaken for a shoplifter by a shop clerk and aspiring dancer Marylin (played by Sally Hawkins). Marylin reluctantly invites Waris to stay with her. They eventually become friends, and while mopping floors at a fast-food restaurant, Waris is asked by a fashion photographer Terry Donaldson (played by Timothy Spall) to pose for the camera.

While the main storyline follows the story of Waris Darie in London, who succeeds as a supermodel (after a few setbacks), Waris's life in Africa is recounted in several flashbacks. The African part of the story is beautifully shot, but lacks a narrative flow, being frequently interrupted by the rag-to-rich story. Strangely ""Desert Flower"" does not give us some details as to how she managed to reach Mogadishu, and then London.

The film avoids graphic descriptions, but its message against FGM (or FGC) is strong, and some scenes at the second half of the film might be disturbing to some viewers. ""Desert Flower"" benefits from a compelling performance from Ethiopian model Liya Kebede as Waris Dirie, who flees her homeland and finds herself thrown into a totally different environment.

German filmmaker Sherry Hormann handles the material with confidence, and the main story concerning Waris Dirie remains strong throughout, but it is undermined by unnecessary subplots (Anthony Mackie's romantic interest, for example), and some of the supporting characters (the exaggerated portrayal of Juliet Stevenson's modeling agent that belongs to somewhere else).

I find ""Desert Flower"" absorbing overall, but its narrative is uneven, and while watching it, I could not help feeling that there could be a better film buried here.",1301788800,2,2285,5.333333333333333

4505629,5,B004Z6N7HS,"This is the second time watching this filme after the accident happened with the dvd and since I've got the bluray now by having the refund, I watched it again. But same ting happend but I've found the solution now.
If I watch this movie with a headphone the dialogue only comes from the left If the sound is 5.1 DTS HD MASTER. But if it's 2.0 DTS HD MASTER, But if watching with the surround sound home theater that thing doesn't appears.

Anyway, this is one of the most touching movie I'v ever seen and I think all the women and even men, to be said, all the human being should watch this film no matter what it takes.
It is not only touching but so much fun to see as well and I personally think that this film is way better then my all time favourite <DEVIL WEARS PRADA>. That is huge thing to say since <DEVIL,..> was kind of really my all time favourite and whenever I feel not good, I watched that film.
This movie really needs a proper release someday and needs a proper audience to be exexposed.

The movie is about the woman who came from Somalia. a really poor country and she just wanted to live in the Uk and she couldn't go back to her place since she couldn't get married to this silly man that she doesn't even know and she got this thing going on too which is,..
When she was about 3, she got forced to get rid of her clithoris from her mother which is a tradition from her tribe for years.
That memory was so powerful that it remained all her life. She thought that it impure feeling the pleasure of sex at all as a woman. That's why they took away that thing.
It was the time when she finally sees a woman who she meets in the UK having sex with a guy and enjoys sex that she finally realized that woman should have right to feel that thing.
Then she got a job at this cheap hanburger fast food chain where she meets this really famous photographer. He asks her to be a model which changes her whole life.
She becomes a superstar although there are things happened since her Visa was expired and she couldn't go back, she had to marry a guy which is a fake and that puppy eyed guy turned out to be a beast.
She ended up with overcome them all.
Now she is a shinning star a big one in NY.
But she still remains as the woman's best friend too who made her stays in her room.
Then one day a popular magazine wanted her to have an interview and she suddenly tells her the story of her own. That changed her to another era.
The wholeUN becomes crazy about her story and they begin to realize how crazy and brurtal it is that is happening in Africa and few other countries still.
She gave up modelling and becomes an embessader and still doing that job.
If you watch this film several things will linger for days.

4505630,5,B004Z6N7HS,"Waris (DESERT FLOWER) Dibie lived a life of poverty but inside her heart as a child, was the hope that one day she would leave Somalia and return to help your family particularly her brother.  Her and her brother made a pact that she would never leave him but one day she had to break her promise when she was betrothed to a man that was old enough to be her grandfather.  The day before the wedding she runs away to paths unknown, thus began her dream.

As Waris is trying to survive in London she is discovered working at a fast food restaurant by a well-known and respected photographer that changed her life.  On the outside Waris was on top of the world as a high fashion model but deep inside she held a secret. In her country, Somalia, females as young as three years old experienced Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).  She had been told and believed that FGM was a normal feat for females and was an introduction into womanhood but she found out that this was untrue.

Waris began on a quest to use her prestige as a high fashion model to be a voice for FGM. She became a United Nations Ambassador on sexual mutilation.

We have explored cultural issues of FGM, the murders and mutilation of albinos in Tanzania etc. Waris Darie's public stand against FMG/C first in a magazine  interview and later as a spokeswoman for the United Nations is inspirational.  The school I teach at has a diverse population, with more than 100 languages  spoken and as students from all of the religious groups. Due to the sexual  content (with the exception of FMG), I was not able to show the movie. The topic  did cause some debate among students  as well as communication between  students from countries where FMG is practiced and parents. Waris Dirie's story  is inspirational to women of all faiths and it is a shame that the sex in the movie prevents it from being shown in schools.",1421452800,,887,4.67741935483871

Particularly gripping is the circumcision scene of five-year old Waris played by three year old Safa Idriss Nour, whose real life parents intended to use the fee from the film to have the same operation performed on their little girl.

Waris Dirie was born in a family of nomads in Somalia, probably in 1965. At the age of 3 she was victim of female genital mutilation (FGM) a barbarian practice still widespread in many countries in Northern and Eastern Africa. At age 13 she was given in marriage to a 60 years old neighbor - refusing this match she escaped and walked for nine days through the desert until she reached the house of her grandmother in Mogadishu. Rejected by her parents, she was ultimately send as a maid (in fact a slave) for the family of a Somali diplomat living in London. Very badly treated and working only for food, shelter and some old clothes she spend there six years almost never leaving the embassy and not even allowed to watch TV. When in 1985 the family she worked for had to leave Great Britain, she stayed behind, as homeless illegal immigrant. She finally managed to find a janitorial job in a McDonalds and it was there than in 1986 a famous photograph Terence Donovan discovered her, when she was cleaning the floor next to his table...

What followed was a great career of top model, a couple of small movie roles (including in a James Bond movie), the writing of a bestselling autobiography and finally the launching of the first worldwide campaign against female genital mutilation (FGM), a barbarian custom NOT LINKED with any religion, which probably originated in Ancient Egypt at least 3000 years ago, long before the appearance of both Christianism and Islam (and maybe even predating Judaism). This horror is still practiced today in at least 28 states, most of them situated in Northern and Eastern Africa but also in Yemen and Indonesia. Waris Dirie campaign helped however to start a movement towards the decline and disappearance of FGM.

Today, retired from modelling, mother of two sons, Waris Dirie lives most of the time in Austria and still fights against FGM.

""Desert flower"" is a very well done, very realistic and very touching story of her life. Although ultimately very optimistic, this film contains also some scenes which I found harder to watch than most of the horror movies I ever saw... Brace yourself for very hard moments.

In this film the main role is played by an Ethopian top model/actress, Liya Kebede, and she does an excellent job! A child actress, Soraya Omar Scego, plays Waris when she was 13 - and she is even more amazing!

4505674,4,B004Z6N7HS,"DESERT FLOWER is a very powerful film that introduces many viewers to the atrocities of Female Genital Mutilation, defined by the dictionary as 'FGM, also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is defined as all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. FGM is typically carried out on girls from a few days old to puberty. It may take place in a hospital, but is usually performed, without anesthesia, by a traditional circumciser using a knife, razor, or scissors.' Though that is not the main driver of this story it certainly makes the life of Waris Dirie who wrote this autobiography recognized as someone who overcame insurmountable odds to become one the world's top models and a speaker for women's rights.

Liya Kebede stars as Waris Darie and is the perfect choice of an actress to fill this role: she is an International supermodel, actress and philanthropist, born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In 2003, she was the first woman of color to become the face of Este Lauder cosmetics.

Waris Dirie (Liya Kebede) was born in Somalia and was subjected to FGM and fled across the desert to freedom form the heinous attitude toward women (Waris as a child is beautifully portrayed by Soraya Omar-Scego). She struggles though dreary jobs, eventually hooks up with Marilyn (Sally Hawkins0 who introduces her to the world of fashion via Terry Donaldson (Timothy Spall), learns how to dress and walk in heels and eventually becomes the great model we know us as today. She has love interests (Anthony Mackie) but her aim is to gain enough credibility and money to go before the WHO and speak aginst the mutilation that exists in many countries to this day.

Directed by Sherry Horman who adapted Dirie's autobiography for the screen with Smita Bhide, the visuals are spectacular and the manner in which the story is related is full of passion and compassion.  The entire cast (including Juliet Stevenson, Meera Syal, and Craig Parkinson) is pitch perfect.  But it is Liya Kebede who fills the screen not only with her beauty but also with a powerful performance of the main character. A very fine film with a heavy message.

4505675,5,B004Z6N7HS,"A moving & powerful story of perseverance & courage.  Despite centuries-old tradition, young Waris refuses marriage to a much older man.  She makes the arduous journey alone, through the desert to her grandmother in Mogadishu.  Civil war in Somalia leads her to London.  While living with diplomatic relatives, she is a maid - treated with disdain.  Diplomatic relations b/w the UK & Somalia end.  Waris is left in London, alone, destitute, without a good grasp of the language.  She learns how to live on the streets.  Eventually she befriends Marilyn; later the photographer, Terry Donaldson.  Her life now moves upward, in fairytale fashion.  She becomes an international supermodel.  She uses her fame to bring worldwide attention to female mutilation for the first time, eventually becoming the UN spokesperson for this cause.

The film also calls attention to adversities women in Waris' culture face daily.  Her mother is beaten by her father for letting Waris leave before her wedding.  Yet, she lets Waris go because she knows it gives her daughter a chance for a better life. When Waris tells the story of her ""circumcision"", the wide-angle scene shot and narration are particularly poignant.  Her mother had to return to home to care for her other children, leaving toddler Waris alone in the wild.  Part of this may have been exaggerated for the screen but can women in the West even conceive of having to make decisions like that??

Liya Kebede gives a great performance as adult Waris.  She projects Waris' innocence and indomitable spirit.  Fine performances from Soraya Omar-Scego as young Waris, and Sally Hawkins as Marilyn.  Excellent cinematography captures grand landscapes of Africa & London, and more intimate portrait shots.

This film inspires due to the perseverance of its title character and the courage of the women she represents.  It also opens our eyes to much larger global issues.  Well worth watching, at least once if not several times.",1332028800,2,1972,5.09375
4505676,5,B004Z6N7HS,"Unbelievable story, all around, of the moment that changed Waris Dirie's life.  It wasn't her being discovered as model at a boutique ice cream shop!  Very high recommend for educating those of us who are much removed from this existence.  I was so shocked to see how inhumane 3YO girls were treated, as well as 13YOs.  The statistics of 6000/day still seems impossilbe, even after this issue has become more mainstream.  Claiming this practice has been performed over 3000 years must be extremely difficult to change but I applaud her effort to use her status to help her fellow countrywomen. The film elements review is meaningless compared to the message conveyed and hopefully the practice eliminated.  My deepest sympathies for all these women throughout the centuries enduring such barbaric atrocities.  Thank you for this film.",1331942400,,834,5.133333333333334
4505677,5,B004Z6N7HS,"I have read all of the Waris Dirie books. Her first, Desert Flower, had me enthralled, emotional and amazed that young girls are mutilated in this tragic manner, then and now. Waris is a strong willed young girl who refuses to enter into an arranged marriage with a man 40-50 years older than her and so runs away from her nomad family in the dark of night across the harsh desserts of the Sudan. She finally makes it to her Grandmother's home in Mogadishu who then sends her to work in the Sudanese London Embassy as a house maid. The Revolution happens and the Embassy closes leaving Waris with nobody to care for her, no grasp of the English language and no money but still with her cherished passport. She befriends a shop assistant who reluctantly offers her a place to stay, temporarily !  They become best friends and as her true internal and external beauty becomes evident she is discovered by a fashion photographer and despite several hurdles, fame, fortune and recognition are hers. Waris now uses that recognition to make the world aware of the mutilation that still occurs today, all over the world, in the name of religion and to keep girls and women objects that men own.  The movie is a close adaptation of the book, and as I watched the same emotions washed over me and tears rolled down my face. I thoroughly recommend you read the book, watch the movie and then read the other two books that follow Desert Flower. We should all do whatever we can to support the abolition of the barbaric practice of female genital mutilation.",1327881600,2,1546,4.5978260869565215
4505678,5,B004Z6N7HS,"First, I commend National Geographic for it's active role in distributing a probably money losing movie that has as it's core storyline a topic that is uncomfortable to discuss and even more difficult to rectify. Second, the practice is extremely common affecting the majority of females throughout western and eastern northern equatorial Africa; parts of the Middle East and to a much smaller extent the rest of the world. Third, through political, economic and educational empowerment for females the practice is beginning to decline - slowly, gradually.

The story of Waris Dirie whether correctly embellished or not is still remarkable, however the core storyline is circumcision (mutilation) and sparking that first step - discussion, is this movie.",1319328000,,754,5.444444444444445
4505679,4,B004Z6N7HS,"This movie profiles the life of model Waris Dirie. She was born in Somalia and lived a nomadic life in the desert. The custom over there is to mutilate a girl's genitalia at an early age to make them ""pure"". Many of the girls (including her sister) don't even survive this assault due to hemorrhage or infection.

Her mother tried to marry her off (as a 4th wife) to an old man when she was only 13. She escaped her village and managed to get a job at the Somali Embassy in London, where some wealthy relatives lived. After the war broke out in Somalia, the embassy closed. She didn't want to go back so she lived on the streets as an illegal while working at a McDonalds.

It was there that she was discovered by famous photographer Terence Donovan in the mid 80s. She goes on to became a successful model but the real story is about her crusade to help end female circumcision. She eventually quit her career to become a UN Ambassador to help end this barbaric practice. This movie definitely made an impact on me and I'm glad I'm a US citizen!",1318723200,4,1046,4.331632653061225
