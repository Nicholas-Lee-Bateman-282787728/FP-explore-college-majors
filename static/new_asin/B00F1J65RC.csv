and the Halloween segment is scarey for little ones!",1495497600,,148,4.285714285714286

8611551,5,B00F1J65RC,"My 2 year old son is obsessed with trains and absolutely loves this video. He wants me to play it over and over again everyday. It's a fun video to watch and not too painful for the adults. Its educational and has some fun songs. My son's favorite parts are the ""Oh no's!"" He also enjoys the songs.  Out of the videos that I've seen by this group so far I have to say this one is the best. I've watched their music video series and I've watched the ""Oh No"" video and I'm not as impressed with those. Even though he loves them, I think they're a little more painful for the adults to watch.",1441411200,,589,4.077586206896552
8611552,5,B00F1J65RC,"I'm writing this review because my 5 year old son specifically asked me to give it a ""thumbs up"".  I asked how many stars out of 5; his answer was 10 - and yes, he knows 10 is twice as many as 5 :). He loves all sorts of trains, and he LOVES this video.

Highly recommended for kids who love model trains, diesel engines...you name it.",1416528000,,335,3.985074626865672
