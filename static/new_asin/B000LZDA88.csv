8165401,4,B000LZDA88,"This issue is better than their first DVD but still not quite as good as the Scubacore series.  The diving scenes are great, however, I found the interviews to be long and boring at times.  Chatterton and Koehler would be better served by spending more time on the diving destinations and less on chit chat.
All in all, this DVD is very good for divers.",1201564800,,353,4.415384615384616
