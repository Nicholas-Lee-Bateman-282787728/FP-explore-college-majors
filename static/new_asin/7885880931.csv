Now regarding the question of subtitles : if what you get is an original BoYing DVD, it's true that there are only traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese and Japanese subtitles, so ""you lose"" - BoYing is one of the very few ""legitimate"" Chinese DVD publishers making no illegal copies : why he would choose not to include English subtitles I couldn't say. But there are a quite a few copies floating around that are ""non-official"" ones made from the BoYing DVDs but with a major modification, i.e. the added English subtitles...
