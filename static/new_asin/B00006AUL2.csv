Knowing as I do that some of the BEST literature in English comes from that little isle I was expecting a little more than the cheap crudity Father Ted proffered.
To say this is Low Rent would not suffice.",1513900800,,329,4.593220338983051
7966583,4,B00006AUL2,"Lighthearted verbal slapstick, to funny to be taken as anything but a lark. A return to craggy island would be very welcome.",1356998400,,124,4.681818181818182

7966585,3,B00006AUL2,"As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the Christmas Father Ted is not quite as funny or entertaining as the other Father Ted series. If you are new to Father Ted, purchase the other series first which are a bit better to see if you enjoy the humor. If you're a die-hard fan, you will want this in your collection and we found it entertaining and full of holiday cheer!",1241913600,,377,4.323943661971831
7966586,3,B00006AUL2,I love Father Ted and have the complete DVD set.  However...this particular episode has a split personality...  The first half of the show makes you believe that this is the best Father Ted ever... It is brilliant and just the first half alone is probably worth watching....  but the last half was incredibly poor.  It just becomes dull... which I have never seen any other Father Ted episode do.,1072483200,,396,4.695652173913044
