8388933,3,B000OHPHBG,"ROSEMARY'S DICIPLES is an oddball video.  It contains a variant of NECROMANCY ( 1972 ) which was the original PG release version of the film.
Additional scenes were shot and inserted into the film and it was re issued as THE WITCHING and re rated R.
NECROMANCY has never been released to home video, while THE WITCHING is all over the place.  ROSEMARY""S DISCIPLES is extremely unusual as it uses an TV edited print of THE WITCHING ( removing all nudity and also deleting some language ) for the bulk of the presentation, and then features the original ending from NECROMANCY ( quite different from THE WITCHING's ending ).",1202342400,4,622,4.697247706422019
