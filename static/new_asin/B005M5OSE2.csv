4834108,5,B005M5OSE2,"May be the most inspirational, touching documentary I've ever seen. Mr. Tisdale was special; gifted musician, great athlete,indomitable spirit,as well as a kind and gentle man. Guess he was too good for this world.....
You get the sense from those interviewed on the film that the people who he came in touch with felt very fortunate to have met him; how many people leave that legacy?

God bless his soul.",1320969600,10,406,4.8
