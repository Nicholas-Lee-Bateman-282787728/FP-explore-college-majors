4829032,1,B000B3O13I,"I wanted to like this for the sake of a fondness for William Holden. After seeing this, I'm surprised he got another job ! You want to strangle the whiney actress that talks with a baby voice. Who fronted the money for this truly dumb forgettable movie ?",1405296000,,254,4.3125
4829033,3,B000B3O13I,"At first I thought it was a bit over acted but I enjoyed seeing Susan Hayward and William Holden when they were young. But my favorite was the older woman, Mabel Paige, I think, playing the part of the APT manager. I could tell that she had been a longtime professional actress. It gets better as it goes along and the film seems in good shape. Susan",1404086400,2,350,4.2388059701492535
4829034,5,B000B3O13I,"I love watching old movies though the unknown ones are usually unknown for a reason. I was not expecting much from the summary of the movie, so was pleasantly surprised by it. The cast has many stars before they were stars. This is a cute, funny movie. I am giving it five stars to boost its rating so that others can enjoy it also.",1401926400,5,332,4.203125
4829035,4,B000B3O13I,"Robert Benchley and Florence MacMichael with her baby-voice-on-helium is the best part of this movie, which is a good deal of fun to watch. A young Susan Hayward and William Holden are part of an ensemble cast portraying kids who are aspiring actors trying to convince Benchley to produce ""their"" play. Merry mix-ups abound.",1399161600,4,324,5.018518518518518
4829036,4,B000B3O13I,I enjoyed this comedy from the early 40's.  Nice to see the early talent displayed by future box office stars William Holden and Susan Hayward.,1397347200,2,143,4.72
4829037,4,B000B3O13I,"A Zany, Mad Cap Movie that shows why these two became great stars.  Funny, with lots of allusions to Stanislavky method and its misinterpretation.  Great Edith Head costumes.  And, God Damn Susan is Beautiful.",1396742400,,209,5.088235294117647
4829038,3,B000B3O13I,Enjoyable plot of struggling actors anxious to impress a noted producer/director played expertly by Robert Benchley...William Holden shows his forthcoming star quality and Susan Hayward also.  Some script lines are dated and silly and that is why I rated picture three stars as it detracts from the story line.,1391990400,,310,5.326530612244898
4829039,2,B000B3O13I,"I only watched about 10 minutes of this one, and I like almost all old movies, but the sound was not good and the story did not appeal to me so I turned it off.",1391990400,,160,3.6
4829040,2,B000B3O13I,"Very dated.  Got bored after 10 minutes.
Young Susan Hayward sure was a beauty.
My fvaorite of oldies is Clara Bow in ""It.""  She was a ""Charmer.""",1390953600,,145,4.333333333333333
4829041,5,B000B3O13I,"Hardly anyone has heard about or seen this 1942 movie, but my sister and I watched it many times in the early days of TV and adored it!  I found a copy on the internet several years ago and it hasn't lost its zany charm, in the manner of ""You Can't Take It With You.""  Ahead of its time, the plot concerns 6 wanna-be actors (guys and gals) sharing an apartment on the sly.  Robert Benchley, William Holden and others who became well-known actors fill out the cast.  This one should be re-released on DVD!!",1132531200,16,505,4.28421052631579
4829042,4,B000B3O13I,A good old fashioned comedy!,1434240000,,28,4.8
4829043,2,B000B3O13I,"Such a shame to waste the talents of William Holden and Susan Hayward in such a silly romp, but at the same time such a joy to watch them again.",1432944000,,144,3.8333333333333335
4829044,5,B000B3O13I,"I enjoyed this film a lot. It was a nice surprise and actually fairly modern in its subject matter for the time. 3 men and 3 women sharing an apartment during an era when this would be frowned upon- it was fun, had some heart and is probably one of my more favorite older films now.",1426636800,,282,4.053571428571429
4829045,5,B000B3O13I,"loved it! It is fun, quirky and I have to say I smiled through the whole movie.",1426550400,,79,3.7058823529411766
4829046,5,B000B3O13I,"Susan Hayward is absolutely amazing, and the most beautiful actress of that golden age..  What a wonderful old movie.",1420070400,,117,5.157894736842105
4829047,5,B000B3O13I,"This movie shows the reality of those actors who strive to make it big on the stage. Knowing many stage actors on and off Broadway, this movie was hilarious, true to life. Plus it's an old movie worthy of your time because it's clean and written with class.",1417478400,,257,4.375
4829048,5,B000B3O13I,"This was a very entertaining, fun, wholesome movie that any one can watch with out cussing, and sex.  My husband and I really enjoyed this movie and hope you do too.",1415232000,,165,4.32258064516129
4829049,5,B000B3O13I,"I enjoyed the movie very much.  It's fun to watch some of the ""old"" movies and see the young actors.",1413158400,,100,4.0
4829050,5,B000B3O13I,"Stick with this and you'll be amply rewarded!  Despite the movie sounding old and taking a bit of time to set things up, once it gets rolling it's really fun.  Those who turned it off too soon missed the best parts, which is a shame.  It's a delightful little comedy, silly and sweet and utterly goofy.  Eddie Bracken was the best of the cast, but they all chimed in and played off one another perfectly.  Give this a chance and enjoy a little light-hearted, good natured film with the requisite happy--and surprising--ending for all!",1407628800,,534,4.638297872340425
4829051,5,B000B3O13I,"Loved it!! I am crazy about old movies, especially the comedies. This one was really fun to watch, lots of zany things happening to keep you entertained! I highly recommend this movie.",1405987200,,184,4.78125
8478067,5,B000B3O13I,"I love this movie, so glad I finally got to watch it.",1468540800,,53,3.5
8478068,4,B000B3O13I,"I really enjoy this movie! Though the antics and the storyline are kind of cheesy, I find myself getting so into it that I feel I'm there with them watching it all play out. I've seen it hundreds of times and I still laugh as though I'm watching it for the first time. Not to mention a young Bill Holden is very nice to watch and the young Eddie Bracken is just as funny and witty as ever!!",1466467200,,390,4.012820512820513
8478069,1,B000B3O13I,Not anchored,1461715200,,12,5.5
8478070,3,B000B3O13I,I enjoyed seeing the William Holden when he was young.  Upbeat silly film.,1461024000,,74,4.6923076923076925
8478071,1,B000B3O13I,The acting is too over the top for our taste.  Good premise but poor acting and directing.  We turned it off after 30 mins.,1456876800,,123,4.083333333333333
8478072,3,B000B3O13I,"Very silly, over the top comedy with some crazy characters. Almost 100% of the film is shot in one apartment. Zany and quick!",1445472000,,125,4.478260869565218
8478073,3,B000B3O13I,Very enjoyable comedy with really good actors hamming it up!,1441497600,,60,5.1
8478074,3,B000B3O13I,"Honestly, I started to watch this one Several Times, yet couldn't get beyond the first 15 to 20 Minutes.",1439078400,,104,4.526315789473684
8478075,4,B000B3O13I,"This was mostly a light-hearted romp about 6 actors, all living in one apartment in New York, who want to debut their play and ""make it"" some day.  There is some clever dialogue and a number of misunderstandings (especially with the landlady) but it all turns out OK in the end.  Note that the sound quality could be better, due to the film's age - had someone taken the time to remaster the audio track.",1438300800,,404,4.373333333333333
8478076,4,B000B3O13I,If you have a soft spot for the old comedies you will enjoy this funny and endearing film!,1436313600,,90,4.055555555555555
