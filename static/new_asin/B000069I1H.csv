1732448,3,B000069I1H,"Showtime tells the tale of a relentless TV producer Chase Renzi (Rene Russo) in search for higher ratings, lands on the idea of a live reality show about cops.  She pairs up two completely different personalities as partners for the program, a no-nonsense LAPD detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) and an actor wanna-be patrol officer Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy.)  Now, with a camera tailing his every move and disrupting his life, Preston have to find a way to continue with an investigation that was botched up by Sellars.
Robert De Niro is a great actor, but when it comes to being a comedian he really isn't very good at it.  Take Analyze This for example, the movie was absolutely dull and was only saved from being an utter disaster by Billy Crystal.  He was a little better in Meet The Parents, but without Ben Stiller it probably wouldn't be as big of a hit.  With Showtime, De Niro gets the job done as the serious and the reluctant type, his acting is impeccable, but only a handful of his lines are actually funny.  Eddie Murphy on the hand is the same as in all his other movies, loud, obnoxious and able to squeeze out a laugh here and there.  So if you like his past works, you'll probably enjoy this film, otherwise don't expect anything different from him.  Rene Russo does a decent job in her supporting role, but she wasn't on screen long enough to make any difference or impact.
Let's face it, this is no Rush Hour (which was a lot more fun than Showtime,) the chemistry between the leads was alright, but good jokes were few and far between, even the attempts at a gag reel in the end was somewhat pathetic.  Overall a fairly mediocre movie, but ultimately a forgetful one.",1016236800,2,1697,4.519607843137255

1732539,2,B000069I1H,"Showtime, 2002 film

A police detective lectures a grammar school class on being a policeman. Are they impressed? Its not like on TV. Next we see a scene - its actors trying out for a TV show. Its night in an urban neighborhood. Two men enter a store, their activity is suspicious. They are buying high quality stuff. There is noise from a helicopter and light. The sellers are suspicious. There is action and shooting! A TV newsman records events. News reporters quickly gather. One reporter wants to follow the Camcorder Killer for sensational news. Reporter Chase Rienzi meets this policeman. Then a purse snatcher appears! An audition? Pretty good chemistry? There is more action when that powerful gun is reclaimed.

Then they show scenes from a TV show. [Almost everything you see on TV is done by actors.] There are comic touches to this satiric drama. Mitch has a hobby in pottery. The TV show creates a workspace to record their activities. Trey tells about his technique. Its a new hit show! [What does that say about the viewing audience?] A man tells a prisoner about the Justice Channel and asks him to tell his story. Brother to Brother? Can you say that on TV? The prisoner gives a name. They go to the Club and talk to the owner. There is action. Then Trey Skellars tells about his acting career. Back home Mitch gets a surprise!

There is an armed robbery of an armored cars money cargo (shooting and a car chase to add action). But Skellars is back on patrol, that acting career is over. Mitch is given time off. They watch a TV show and see a person. They go to his home and discover new facts. [No search warrant?] After this they go to a GUN SHOW to search for Csar. There is more shooting and action! Mitch and Trey pursue the villain to an upper floor. Helicopters fly around the building. That powerful weapon creates an indoor flood! The cameras record this. Trey passed his detective exam and gets a gift. The movie ends with various comic scenes.

Could this be a hit on TV? I don't think so. While a little comedy can enhance a drama this drama has too much. But its not bad if you accept it as a parody and comedy about the shows on television.",1454976000,,2173,4.47979797979798

1732605,3,B000069I1H,"I watched this expecting it to be like 1988's great classic with De Niro, ""Midnight Run"", in which he co-starred with the fabulously understated comic actor, Charles Grodin. This film is no ""Midnight Run"". It is an ok evening's entertainment but there are two things wrong with it. The first is Eddie Murphy, who just is not a great foil for De Niro like Grodin was. Second, the script is lame. A reality tv show forces De Niro to star in a pilot series effort because De Niro shot out a reporter's camera. Murphy is along for the ride as his partner. De Niro is the best thing in this film. I only wish someone had tried harder to recreate the magic of ""Midnight Run"". If you are going to buy a video tonight for this kind of fare, rent or buy that one, not this one. I'm grading this three stars for De Niro alone as he elevates anything.

1732636,3,B000069I1H,"This film is mostly fun with some clever humor. It mocks TV reality shows and has good casting. Robert De Niro delivers an entertaining character with some nice touches but Eddie Murphy just sets up one gag after another and then makes faces at the camera - sort of painful to watch. William Shatner is the most fun as he coaches Eddie on how to play a TV cop. The story comes off as confused, an uneasy partnership of wacky comedy and gritty drama, and I would have preferred a more serious treatment of the assault rifle plot line. Other buddy movies have done this better. OK for a cheap rental when you can't find anything else but don't go out of your way to see it.",1396310400,,671,4.291338582677166

1732708,4,B000069I1H,"Reality television has been around long enough that it is time to make movies that parody what they do, and how they do it. This film does that, while also skewering the concept of a cop buddy movie. For one, these cops are not buddies and may never be, they don't even like each other. In the film a real cop Robert DeNiro is antagonistic about being ordered to allow a film crew to film him while he works. Worse yet they settle him with a cop who is also a struggling hammy actor, played to perfection by Eddie Murphy. Before you know it the show is bending the reality, changing their clothes, office, cars and home to be more TV friendly. The real question is does this draw out the real person inside the cop, or does it make a cheesy imitation of the real cop? The lines get blurry and the answer is not so simple. The movie is a lot of fun, big blowups, big laughs, an over the top villain, and all in all great popcorn movie.",1309564800,,934,4.165745856353591

He has had mega success in Shreik and Dream Girlz but he seems to make a good film and follow it up by making three bad films in a row. This brings us to the film Showtime. If this movie was filmed in the 80's it might be freshier and funnier. However, today this movie comes out as predictable and stale. DeNiro does his usual curmudgeon shtick with the usual facial expressions and Murphy still tries to act like he's the funniest man alive.

1732748,1,B000069I1H,"Alright Andy, here it is; another review - can you do it?  Do you have the integrity to speak honestly about films from an un-formally educated opinion?  You watch, you make your thoughts known, no pressure - no pressure at all ... alright, here it goes, you have to psych yourself up.  Here it comes: three deep breaths and ... it's SHOWTIME!  Wow, that hurt more than I anticipated, especially near the end when it was obvious that I wanted to say more, but repetition just seemed to be the only way out.  I have to apologize to my readers for this pathetic attempt at an opening comment, but it was the only way to really bring my thoughts focused with my newest jump into early 2000s cinema with ""Showtime"".  This film was a clich attempt to make a buddy cop movie with two decently respected actors in Hollywood, using a script that used swiss cheese as it's co-writer, and genuine moments where money was being gobbled with special effects instead of powerful storytelling.  This was a sad attempt at a film, and I have no problem saying that both Mr. Murphy and Mr. De Niro should be rather ashamed with their outing in this project.  Even as you listen to the audio commentary of this film, the filmmakers (both director and producer) didn't think the audiences would understand what was happening or remember certain characters throughout this very weak plot.  If the creators don't give the audience enough credit, than why I bother giving my attention to the smallest of detail with this film?  Why?  Because Hollywood, I paid for this movie - you're gonna get a comment whether you like it or not - and ""Showtime"" is one of the best ways to start.

I don't understand jokes.  I do believe this is my problem with modern cinema, or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation.  Isn't it odd - people just don't laugh as much anymore, and I do believe one of the diseases to that problem is the film ""Showtime"".  There was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all of the bantering between Murphy and De Niro, with Russo as eye candy, with even standard clichs which make the general population swoon with pre-programmed laughter, there was nothing in this film that made me laugh.  There weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film.  From the beginning, I didn't buy the match-up of De Niro and Murphy as anything more than Hollywood excitement, throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the shoot - where was it in the film?  This falls to either two problems - the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film.  Either way, they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the Hollywood nightmare ""Showtime"".

Outside of finding no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film.  There was a glimpse of humor with De Niro's desire to pick up pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine so audiences would understand - WHO DOES THAT?), but that was dropped and never developed.  There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but outside of that one opening monologue, nobody would have understood that.  He rents a room in a producer's house in which he can afford on a police officer's salary?  This just didn't compute even for Hollywood standards.  There was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the gun was never developed, nor was there any true test of the weapons capability ... even at the end.  It became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns.  Where was the television show in this?  Russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning, but there were no consequences.  There was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribble.  Random characters were introduced, forgotten, re-introduced, and forgotten all over again.  The director and producer laughed at this, while we, the meager viewer, must suffer through inside jokes and clich stereotypes.

Was there a love interest in this film?  Was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen?  Were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to Robert De Niro?  Was there random chaos throughout this film?  If you need the answers to these, obviously, you won't find them in ""Showtime"".  The fact that I am riddling this review with question upon question, only means that this sub-par (actually, well below sub-sub-sub par) filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic world.  Sure, it had big names and one really neat explosion, but there was nothing of substance to this at all.  It was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichs, but not regular clichs - go with the bad ones.  The plot had no linear structure.  The jokes were boring.  The characters were drab and underdeveloped.  This ranks below even the best of ""buddy-cop"" films.  I like to give films the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this film.  Not even Shatner could save this film, and he even tried hard.

Overall, I cannot, nor will I, suggest this film to anyone with a pulse.  The commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws, horrid jokes, and creators questioning the validity of their work.  If creators can't stand behind ""Showtime"", why should we?  I didn't want a ""Lethal Weapon"" when I watched this, but I did want something like that.  I understand there was some form of criticism of ""reality television"" and the corrupt nature of the media, but that message didn't make it off the page.  In fact, I believe I saw ""media"" leave the theater first when I watched this.  Shame carries its heavy hand with this film and I cannot blame it.  Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see ""Coming to America""), but lately he seems to have lost his edge.  De Niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him, but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further.  One of these films is equal to one Scorsese picture.

Skip this one.  I promise, it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile.  Oh, and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this film - I am truly sorry!

And shucks, wouldn;t you know it, we can all only come up with two: 48 Hours and Trading Places. Afer that, there's a huge falloff and no one can come up with a film that gets more than a star and a half.

We finally decided that this film would merit the third spot. But only because it had Robert DeNiro in it, not because of its quality.

Anyway, I thought it was funny the way Eddie Murphy stormed out of the Oscars after he didn't win for Showgirls. It was very reminiscent of the way I leave the theatre after about 30 minutes of most of his films.

Rene Russo fills in the role of the aggressive producer who helms the series, which becomes a hit, at DeNiro's chagrin.  The movie's plot involves a mean and nasty gunrunner and it's up to our heroic pair to get him off the streets.

As a comedy, there have been funnier buddy cop movies; as an action drama, it has its fair share of exciting chases and some explosive action, climaxing in a swimming pool disaster.

While Mitch hates the whole idea of the show, Trey can't help but be caught up in he idea of being a star.

Pairing up two greats, Robert De NIro and Eddie Murphy, was pure casting genius, as they generate great chemistry together, making the film an action-comedy worth seeing.  Robert De Niro does a great job as straight man for Eddie Murphy.

Robert De Niro plays the role of LAPD Detective Mitch Preston, a hard-boiled, no nonsense flatfoot, who knows the streets and knows how to do his job. Eddie Murphy plays the role of Officer Trey Sellars, a patrolman who also moonlights as a would be actor, talentless though he may be, as he would rather play a cop than be a cop.

Rene Russo, as gorgeous as ever, plays the role of television executive, Chase Renzi, who needs a hit show. She wants to do a cop reality show, and due to circumstances that present themselves, Detective Mitch Preston and Officer Trey Sellars have been tagged to foot that bill. Forced to work together, followed by television camera crews, the two become instant celebrities, much to Detective Preston's chagrin and Officer Sellars' delight.

William Shatner is in the film, playing himself as the actor who played cop T.J. Hooker on a television series of the same name. Shatner is up to snuff and very funny. Look for Alex Borstein of Mad TV fame in the small role of the casting director.  Look also for Johnnie Cochran in a cameo role.

""Showtime"" - the name of the film as well as of the reality tv show within the movie - stars Murphy as an inept, action-movie inspired junior cop who moonlights as an aspiring actor, and DeNiro as a more capable cop who ends up in trouble with his superiors after getting into a scuffle with the media.  In order to avoid a lawsuit, the police department have to make DeNiro star in a new reality tv series that'll follow he and brand-new partner Murphy (chosen specifically by the producers because DeNiro doesn't want to work with Murphy, who previously botched a major operation by trying some overly flamboyant heroics he apparantly saw in a movie) on their appointed rounds.  Great comedy ensues, with appearances by Rene Russo as the show's producer and William Shatner as himself (brought in to give DeNiro acting lessons!) in a small but brilliant part.  One of the very best comedies in years, and a much better action movie than most (but not all) big-budget summer blockbusters.

1732779,3,B000069I1H,"You have to admit that the idea of teaming up Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy is certainly interesting, but who would have thought they both would be upstaged by William Shatner playing William Shatner?  ""Showtime"" is a film that has its cake and eats it too by making fun of the cop buddy comedy movie at the same time it embraces the genre.  That might explain why you have the feeling at the end of this 2002 film that you are watching a different movie than the one you started out watching.
De Niro is Mitch, a streetwise cop who lives in the real world and takes pride in doing his job and the fact that he has never had to choose between cutting the red wire or the green wire.  Murphy is Trey, a patrolman who likes being a cop but would also like to play a cop on TV.  Rene Russo is the television executive, sort of a second grade Faye Dunaway ""Network"" type, who takes the opportunity to bring these two together when Mitch makes the mistake of blowing away a television camera during a shootout (his partner has been shot, there is a guy out there with the biggest gun you have ever seen, and for some reason Mitch does not like a bright light being shined on them in the dark of night).  To avoid a multi-million dollar law suit Mitch is ordered to play ball with the television people, even if that means constantly being followed by cameras as he tries to do his job and putting Trey in the seat next to him.  While Chase waits for Mitch to explode on camera, we wait for him to bond with Trey.
That is the premise of ""Showtime,"" and the biggest irony is that the best scenes involve setting up the premise rather than the plot that keeps intruding on the fun.  The only thing better than Eddie Murphy teaching Robert De Niro how to act is when William Shatner shows up and the pair have T.J. Hooker show them how it is done.  Perhaps not since the Marx Brothers ran rampant has the screen had three such divergent approaches to acting in a single scene, which Shatner steals from the other two.  The best line in the film is when Shatner informs Chase that Mitch is the worst actor he has ever seen.  Unfortunately the rest of the film does not match the levels of humor at work during this training sequence and you have to give credit to the actors who can make a simple scene such as Mitch watching Trey watching Shatner hysterical.
The film is directed by Tom Dey, who did ""Shanghai Noon"" and apparently is content to find a niche as a buddy film director.  Then again, if you get De Niro and Murphy should you be complaining about being typed as a director?  This is an action comedy where the action gets in the way of the comedy and once Shatner disappears the movie shifts into a different gear.  Yes, there is a point where comedies like this have serious moments and we realize that underneath the banter and animosity there are feelings of affection and mutual respect, but with ""Showtime"" you just get the feeling they are pouring on the cliches they spent so much time ridiculing in the first half of the film.",1060560000,3,3039,4.338624338624339

I don't know if it was on purpose or not, but the movie was extremely predictable.  But, I was able to look past that because of Murphy and De Niro's performances.
Eddie Murphy is always top notch in any movie he is in and so is De Niro.  Both are very funny, but not exactly pee your pants funny.  There were some very ingenious scenes, ones that I will remember for a while, especially the Hummer scene. However, the movie seemed that it took 30 minute breaks from comedy.  It was funny, and then it got serious, and then it got funny again.  That really turned me off because it creates a lack of pace.
Showtime was a good movie, don't get me wrong.  It kept me interested through out and the whole big brother is watching scenario was very intriguing.  I can definitely see some sort of show like this on television in the near future.  I'd watch.

1732801,3,B000069I1H,"Such a promising concept (as unoriginal as it may be) like this cannot be fully exercised in a 95 minute long movie. Had this movie been made a few years ago then it may have been a bit more original and 'in time' to be a part of the whole 'reality TV' boom.

As it stands 'Showtime' is neither ironic nor exciting and you will forget it completely 5 minutes after watching it. If the movie were extended to a little over 2 hours, with tighter editing and a better script it may have worked. Nothing is fully explored or exploited in this film and the villain is so weak and pointless his role could easily have been played by a ghost.

'Showtime' really ought to have been a mini-series. This would have offered a greater sense of self-referential, ironic humor and given more time to devote to plot, character, action and intelligence. But in this hour and a half movie, director Tom Dey cannot make anything work.

Murphy isn't funny, DeNiro is sleepwalking and Russo is wasted. The only person contributing anything of worth is Shatner. And the references to his TJ Hooker show are ironic by accident in regards to Hooker being better than 'Showtime' and 'Showtime' within the movie.

This movie is only an example of money thrown away and the totally wrong approach given to a promising concept. I would rent it. But make sure it is the widescreen version as the fullscreen (actually pan and scan, or 'CROPPED') has about %50 of the picture missing.

The commentary is uninteresting and I must seriously point out that the advertised 'Uproarious additional scenes, including hilarious improvised Eddie Murphy' are anything but. Even if I had watched my own autopsy they probably still would be  the most uncomfortable and unfunny things I have ever witnessed in my life. The HBO documentary is light promotional fluff hosted by William Shatner and the extended scenes offer nothing new.

Murphy is a cop who wants to be an actor. Deniro is a detective who punches out a camera man and is forced to become part of a ""cops"" like TV show. Murphy auditions and gets the part as his partner and the two couldn't be more different. They rub each other the wrong way and while Murphy is trying to look good on the show to land a big acting job, Deniro is trying to be a typical cop. Its humorous to watch the interaction between the overacting murphy, who represents the typical police drama, and the serious Deniro who represents real cops. In one scene shatner is showing deniro and Murphy how to do some ""hood jumping"", Murphy pulls it off like a pro and deniro remarks that hood jumping never happens in real life, but later on we find him hanging on to the hood of a car in a high speed chase.  I really like deniro and murphy together, and though murphy isn't the best actor, it doesn't really come out in the movie, because he's playing the part of a poor actor trying to act like a ""TV"" cop the whole time. The only problem I have with the movie is the ending with the camera since its not very believable. The acting is ok, the plot is interesting, but the humor and satirical irony are what kept me interested, and even if you don't ""get it"" and like simple movies, you'll enjoy and laugh at this one.",1044921600,3,1483,4.240282685512367

1732804,3,B000069I1H,"Buddy-buddy movie comes with star-star concept.  That's what I thought about ""Showtime"" when I watched its trailer.  And the fact is, it was.
As director Tom Dey united Jackie Chan with Owen Wilson in ""Shanghai Noon,"" he again makes a combination of Eddie Murphy with Robert Deniro.  As ""Shanghai Noon"" is passable entertainment (but not definitely the best of Jackie), so ""Showtime"" is again passable entertainment with not-so-good Eddie and not-so-good DeNiro.  Plus, in the fashion of ""Lethal Weapon"" series, they added Rene Russo.  But it's no wonder; for the two of the screenplay writers, Alfred Gough and Miles Miller are responsible for ""Lethal Weapon 4.""  Too classic.
Anyway, ""Showtime"" shows how these two stars Murphy and DeNiro crack the case of secretly-made deadly weapons, which can easily tear down a house.  Along the investigation, you see ambitious TV producer Rene Russo take advantage of Deniro's blundered case, and use the most unlikely pair as the feature of her new reality TV show named, why not, ""Showtime.""
Basically ""Showtime"" -- I mean this film itself -- should not be taken too seriously.  Though the film has something to say about the media, it knows it is also part of the media, so it doesn't pose any serious questions before us.  It rather is intent on making use of the pair, which, however, works very sporadically.  Humor is there, good-natured feeling is also there, but these feelings just fail to be felt by us.  In short, the film lacks chemistry.  Usually delightful Rene Russo ends up with being clithed and banal, and bad guys are just bad guys without any menace or dark humor.  Willaim Shatner appears as a guest, almost as himself when he did his own police drama 20 years ago, but hey, how many people remember that?  For some reason, they decided to include a cameo of one famous lawyer JC, but what we need is some other things or people, something that would enliven the whole show.
Actions are staged decently, with explosions and cars and a big dish, but the fact that these actions are impressive means these two stars are really wasted, having lost their opportunity to impress us.  You have no irresistible chemistry between Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in ""48hrs,"" which made the latter an instant star, or comical feelings generated between Charles Groding and Robert DeNiro in ""Midnight Run.""

1732812,2,B000069I1H,"Robert De Niro must be going through mid life crisis.  Arguably one of the best dramatic actors of his generation, De Niro continues to try to prove himself as a comic actor in a parade of mediocre scripts (The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Meet the Parents, Analyze This, Showtime).  De Niro isn't a terrible comedian; he is just such a great dramatic actor that his comic ambitions seem pointless.  It is like Michael Jordan trying to play baseball.
This script is a weak satire of reality cop shows and buddy cop flicks.  It is no coincidence that the director of this film is Tom Dey, whose only other directorial effort was ""Shanghai Noon"", a Jackie Chan vehicle where Jackie does a comic duet with Owen Wilson in a lampoon of westerns.  The hope was that Dey would be able to weave the same kind of satirical magic here, but this film comes up way short.  To his credit, he did manage to give the film some good action footage.
De Niro tries to play the straight man in an absurd situation and it seems like his is the only character that realizes the lunacy of it.  Everyone else seems to take their absurdity seriously.  The tongue in cheek comedy is way over the top.  Rene Russo, William Shattner and Eddie Murphy overact so terribly that it is more sad than funny.

1732813,4,B000069I1H,"SHOWTIME is a really a funny, funny movie. I think Eddie Murphy (I Spy, The Nutty Professor, Mulan) is one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood. And teamed up with Robert Dinero (Analyze That, Casino, Midnight Run), who is doing a lot of comedy these days, the acting pair creates some very funny stuff.
The story is about police officer(and actor) Murphy and real detective Dinero being teamed together for a reality based TV show produced by Rene Russo (Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle, Ransom, Outbreak). Of course they are complete opposites, they hate each other and they don't want to do this with each other. As an advisor they hire none other than T.J. Hooker himself, William Shatner (Star Trek, Miss Congeniality Dumbfellas) - excellently playing himself the actor, to advise them on being TV cops. The rest is bad guys vs. good guys and a lot of comedy in between.
Of course the end all is that they bad guy gets his due, the ladies get their man and both Murphy and Dinero earn valuable lesions in friendship and trust. Not mention they even include the bloopers during the credits - and I love when movies do that. A lot. The film was directed by Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) in his second feature film
The DVD extras feature a great and interesting commentary by the director and the producer and a lot of behind the scenes and deleted scenes. Also there is a cleverly written making of special that has William Shatner as the host. Bill is obviously having fun doing this and he doesn't mind making fun of himself too. And, at near 70 years old, he can still run and role and jump over car hoods. Not bad Bill!
I enjoyed this movie and DVD a lot. It has some great car crashes and chases and some interesting staging of events as well as the clich&eacute; `Hollywood' types that give Hollywood its public impression. I would get this just for the `fun' of it! (9-9-02)",1031788800,3,1886,4.55

Trey, however is ecstatic at the opportunity to show of his acting talents, and easily earns a huge fan following, much to Preston's irritation.
I really liked this film. It was funny, entertaining, and really showed both actors' range. Trey is believable as a two-bit actor and wannabe cop, and Preston is great as a burned-out, hard-luck police detective.

Trey Sellars is a cop who doesn't take his work that serious but he is a entertaining actor. When Mitch shoots a video news camera that is filming a wounded officer the Maxis tv network sues the precient if Mitch doesn't do a relaity tv cop show that Chase Rense a producer came up with. Mitch is stuck and has to do it.
Trey applies for the part as Mitch's partner and gets it. Mitch doesn't like Trey because he treats his job so easily. Mitch and Trey get camera tips from T.J.Hooker(William Shatner playing himself)and Mitch still doesn't take his acting seriouly. On the other hand Trey is doing wonderful and the public love him.
In just about every movie there is a bad guy and in this movie the bad guy has a gun that could do mass detruction. It is a custom made gun that Mitch and Trey have to track down before more people die.

1732817,2,B000069I1H,"The comedic pairing of Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro at first sounds like a good idea. And the premise of this film, mocking reality TV, namely cop reality shows, is promising. But this film doesn't take advantage of its potential and instead recycles old jokes.
Every once in awhile, something begins to shine out; a joke begins to develop or a commentary on the manipulation of truth in reality television, but just as you think this film might have a saving grace it buries the good ideas with the same bad jokes and sight gags that have been done in countless other brain-dead movies.
Having Murphy and De Niro on screen, though, is fun at times. In fact, when William Shatner is thrown into the mix, mocking his T.J. Hooker character by playing himself, the film starts take off. But Shatner's screen time is short, and before you know it, the film returns to a clichd comedy.
The action mixed in the film is also boring. There was no life or energy to these scenes. Bad guys shoot at cops, cops shoot back. Cars launch in the air and burst into flames. No emotional involvement, no heart in your throat reaction. Just action that made me yawn and check the clock.
The film also doesn't seem to know how it wants to portray the real world of police. It opens with De Niro telling a classroom how real cops don't have a lot of shootouts, and cars don't blow up from being shot at. But a few minutes later, De Niro lands in a shootout with drug dealers, and throughout the film lands in one big shootout, blow up scene after another. This schizophrenic visualization of police work is confusing. Yes it is a comedy and doesn't necessary need to be believable, but it set up the rules of the world it takes place and then shows a world breaking all those rules. That's not a sign of comedy genius, that's a sign of poor filmmaking.

1732829,4,B000069I1H,"""Showtime"" is a fun comedy starring two movie stars who I never thought I would see paired: Eddie Murphy and Robert Deniro.
They made a great pair and a good chemistry working together as two cops who are on a reality t.v. show (think: cops & big brother mixed together). Deniro's character, Mitch Preston, wants nothing to do with it, and Murphy's character, Trey Sellars, is an actor as well as police officer, is pysched to be working as an actor. Even thought their characters don't really have much in common, they somehow seem to blend well together and balance each other out.
Mitch is divorced and spends much of his spare time doing pottery, this does little to add to the plot, but is more of a sideline.
Trey is a quick talking, ""dumb"" cop type, who is trying really hard to be an actor along side his career as an officer of the law.
Rene Russo is the only other name in this snappy little comedy. She plays Chase Renzi, a pushy t.v. journalist who wants to use Trey and Mitch to her advantage to get ratings.  Not her usual kind of role, she pulls it off anyway. She does a great job in
her supporting role.
This was a genuinely good comedy, and I really liked it. I laughed a lot!!!! It was really funny.
Even though it is somewhat predictable, it is also a very entertaining film. There are some good performances here, and I think Murphy and Deniro were great together.
Highly recommend this one for fans of comedy genre, but especially fans of Deniro and Murphy

Both, De Niro and Murphy were visibly uncomfortable, and their scenes together seemed forced. Pity, because I believe with a better script, and tighter direction, it would have worked beautifully, as much as the pairing of De Niro and Billy Crystal did in Analyze This.
The idea of the film is quite good though, filming a reality cop show, with a tough no nonesense cop( De Niro) and his forced partner, a show off aspiring actor cop (Murphy).But the whole thing remains an idea, and it does not develop well on screen.
Granted, Murphy has some good moments, as he always does, and De Niro is one of the best actors of all time, but sadly it is a waste of their talents.

It is, however, good for a few laughs and an hour and a half of entertainment if you go into it not expecting too much. There are some good one liners and the comedy from Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are strictly the same comedy you always see from them. Nothing new.
Basically, the movie is about DeNiro being forced into doing a reality show about cops and having to be partnered with Eddie Murphy who he doesn't think is a good cop. That's about it. The plot is weak at best. The acting is good (due to the two main stars incredible acting ability and experience) but the talent is somewhat wasted on a poor script. There really isn't that much ""action"" one or two good action sequences, but even those aren't that exciting. Much more dialogue than anything else and when you factor a weak script into that scenario you get ""Showtime""
Again, the movie isn't that bad, but you just can't expect too much. It'll cure 90 minutes of boredom. I am an enormous Robert DeNiro fan and this is why I saw it even amidst the many bad reviews. Mr. DeNiro, please make a movie that isn't a comedy...I'm not saying your bad at comedy, but I'd like to see you back in a role you were born to play!

As for the performances from Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, they were the best performances that I've seen in a long time. In fact, since Murphy hit it big with the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" series. And to me, I think that you very rarely see DeNiro in a comedic role, not to mention when he was in ""Meet the Parents"", and that it is such a great departure from his usual tough-guy action roles. ""Showtime"" focuses on Mitch Preston (DeNiro), a 28-year police veteran who, during a sloppy bust one night, inadvertedly crosses paths with another cop named Trey Sellars (Murphy), or a.k.a. ""Ice Trey"". When the TV stations arrive to film the bust, Mitch loses his cool and shoots the camera, which results in making the front page news and a lawsuit from the TV station that owned the camera. One of the executives, Chase Renzi (Rene Russo) likes what she sees in Mitch and decides to create an idea for a ""reality"" based cop show, and the lead is none other than...Mitch Preston, whom Chase invisions him as a real-life ""Dirty Harry"". When Chase is given the green light, she and her assistant, Annie (DeNiro's daughter, Drena DeNiro) go out to try to convince Mitch to do the show, but Mitch refuses. And that doesn't go too well with his boss, Capt. Winship (Frankie Faison), who gives Mitch pretty much a reality check on his career if he doesn't do the show. And so Mitch agrees. Now Chase has to think of a partner for Mitch, and soon enough, that part went to none other than Trey Sellars, who is struggling to become an actor, and whom Mitch absolutely refuses to work with! But pretty much, Mitch has no choice as they are now partners for their new cop show in which Sellars describes as ""SHOWTIME""! And hilarity, trouble, and action ensues from there on. ""Showtime"" has everything that you'd expect from a Robert DeNiro film...action and a few unexpected laughs!

  Rene Russo is fun in a supporting role and William Shatner is absolutely hilarious as himself trying to teach De Niro how to play to the camera.  If he had more scenes he would steal the show.

And even if you haven't seen the previews, it won't take you long to pick up on what you're in for-- specifically, a good time and plenty of laughs-- from this clever satire of ""Reality TV"" shows and ""Buddy Cop"" movies, ""Showtime,"" directed by Tom Dey, starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy.
 Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a detective with the L.A.P.D., and he's good at what he does; but working a case one night, things suddenly go south when another cop, Trey Sellars (Murphy), inadvertently intervenes, a television news crew shows up and Mitch loses his cool, which results in a lawsuit by the television station that's going to cost the department some big bucks.  Except that they may be able to get around it, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in Mitch-- enough to pitch an idea to her boss for a ""Reality"" cop show, that would feature none other than Mitch Preston, whom Chase sees as a real life ""Dirty Harry.""
 Her boss likes the idea and gives Chase the green light.  Now all she has to do is convince Mitch to participate, which shouldn't be too hard, since the station has agreed to drop the lawsuit if he will do the show.  But Mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he wants nothing to do with any of it-- that is until he has a heart-to-heart with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who puts Mitch's future into succinct perspective for him.  And just like that, the show is on.  Oh, yes, there's one more thing; for the show, Mitch is going to need a partner.  And who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that?  Let's put it this way:  Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects.
 This is Dey's second film as a director, his first being ""Shanghai Noon,""-- also a comedy-- and he's definitely showing a penchant for the genre.  From the opening frames he establishes a pace that keeps the story moving right along, and he allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing.  With stars like De Niro and Murphy, Dey, of course, had a leg up on this project to begin with, but he's the one who keeps it on track, demonstrating that he knows what works, achieving just the right blend of physical comedy and action, and employing the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect.
 There isn't a more natural actor in the business than De Niro, and he steps into Mitch's skin like he was born to it.  And after years of doing hard-edge, cutting drama (in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another), with such films as ""Analyze This,"" ""Meet the Parents"" and now this one, he has firmly established his proficiency for doing comedy, as well.  Mitch is not an especially complex character; he is, in fact, something of an ""ordinary"" guy, but therein lies the challenge for the actor-- to make him believable, to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community.  And on all counts, De Niro succeeds.  He's Mitch, the guy you run into at the grocery store or the bank, or say ""good morning"" to on your way to work; who likes to watch the game on TV and has a life, just like you and me, who happens to make his living by being a cop.  It's the character Mitch has to be to make this film work, because it makes the ""ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances"" angle credible.  It's one of those role-- and work-- that is often wrongly dismissed out-of-hand, because it looks so easy; and, of course, this is what makes De Niro so exceptional-- he does make it look easy, and he does it with facility.
 As Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy turns in a winning performance, as well, and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial glove.  Trey is a cop, but also an aspiring actor-- and a bad one-- and it gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the over-exuberant side of his personality (reigned in enough by Dey, however, to keep him from soaring over-the-top into Jim Carrey territory), which works perfectly for this character and this film.  From his melodramatic take on a part during an audition, to his throwing out of one-liners-- delivered by looking directly into the camera (which as far as he's concerned isn't even there) while filming the ""reality"" show-- Murphy's a riot.  And he has a chemistry with De Niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected, as this is another of De Niro's many talents; his ability to connect with and bring out the best in his co-stars, all of whom-- evidence will support-- are better at their craft after having worked with him, including the likes of Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, just to name a few).  Most importantly, this is a part that allows Murphy to excel at what he does best, and he certainly makes the most of it.
 Russo makes the most of her role as Chase, too, a character who isn't much of a stretch artistically, but whom she presents delightfully, with a strong, believable performance.  And William Shatner (playing himself) absolutely steals a couple of scenes as the director of the show.
 The supporting cast includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday (Camera Man).  Well crafted and delivered, ""Showtime"" is a comedy that's exactly what it is meant to be:  Pure entertainment that provides plenty of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will have you chuckling for some time after.

1732862,2,B000069I1H,"I swear there was a time when Robert De Niro was in a movie, it usually meant it was good. Right now I'm thinking of ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Raging Bull"", and ""The Godfather pt. 2"" not to mention many many other true classics in cinema. If De Niro wants to try ""lighter"" stuff, that's fine. I didn't mind ""Analyze This"". I thought it was a good movie. But, there's a line between good and bad films. And De Niro is sadly crossing this line.
 ""Showtime"" to be honest has a rather mindless plot. It's on the corny side. There is nothing memorable about this film. I saw it Saturday and today, I can't remember more than 5 mins put together of what I saw.
 Why is this movie so bad? It's boring. I never felt like the movie went anywhere. It has all these jokes and ideas in it's head but, nothing ever amounts to much. The jokes aren't that funny.

It has a nice cast; Robert De Niro, Eddie Murphy, Rene Russo and a cameo by Willam Shatner.
 ""Showtime"" is about two cops. One who does his job well and another who only became a cop because he was a bad waiter. The good cop is Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) and bad one is Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). Sellers want to become an actor. And after an incident in the open moments of the film, (I won't give it away)Sellers finds out that he and Preston are now going to be partners on a reality cop show called...""Showtime"". The reason for the show is because Preston is seen as a loose cannon. A ""Dirty Harry"" as tv producer Chase Renzi (Rene Russo) describes him. The ""humor"" comes from the fact that these two cops don't like each other. This all sounds mind numbingly boring to me.
 ""Showtime"" has one good scene. It deals with Willam Shatner trying to ""teach"" De Niro and Murphy to act like tv cops. Who knows, maybe this could have been a good film. But, what we see on screen is anything but a good film.

Showtime was meant to be a action-comedy.  There was a good mix of both.  As usual, you see Eddie Murphy providing comic relief with what he says and does.  His role as a patrolman and actor-wannabe lets him shine.  He's constantly talking and screwing up.  Robert de Niro plays the uptight stuck-up cop who hates change and people.

1732865,2,B000069I1H,"**1/2 About the best thing that can be said for ""Showtime"" - a throwaway buddy cop comedy starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy - is that it demonstrates that an inferior script can be at least partially overcome by first-rate performances.
You can't go too wrong when you have acting talent of this caliber working for you.  De Niro and Murphy portray two LAPD officers who are recruited to be the central ""characters"" for a new ""Cops""-type reality TV show, wherein a camera crew will follow the two on their appointed rounds as they chase suspects, round up criminals and, all in all, make the streets of LA safe for the common, decent citizen.  De Niro's Mitch Preston is a reluctant participant in the series, while Murphy's Trey Sellars is a wannabe actor with stars in his eyes who sees this as his golden opportunity to make it big in show business.
The initial problem with ""Showtime"" is that it feels more like a ""high concept"" exercise than an actual movie.  Despite the fact that there are a number of funny moments in the film, too many of the scenes fall flat both as comedy and as action drama.  The saving grace is that De Niro's understated cynicism provides an effective counterpoint to Murphy's over-the-top enthusiasm, resulting in just enough comic tension to wring laughs out of even the weakest of material.  It is a joy to watch these two pros at work and they are nicely complemented by Rene Russo as the driven TV producer whose brainchild serves as the excuse for the story.  William Shatner, playing himself, also generates some laughs, often at his own good-natured expense.
Yet the film itself is a failure.  One of the prime dictums of the screenplay is to try to show the discrepancy between police work as it is portrayed on the screen and police work as it really is.  In fact, the film opens with veteran De Niro instructing a class of elementary school children about the mundane realities of life on the job.  Yet, the film betrays its own theme by itself indulging in all the inane shoot-em-up and car chase scenes it is supposed to be satirizing (the scenes are not exploited for comic effect, which might have lent some much needed satirical bite to the proceedings).  Even worse, the ""serious"" side of the story, involving drug deals and gun running, fails to generate any interest or suspense.
Oh well.  De Niro and Murphy are such likable comic actors that the movie, for all its many weaknesses, manages to whiz by without inflicting too much boredom and pain.  ""Showtime"" is a completely forgettable and innocuous little time waster, but fans of these particular actors will at least appreciate their efforts.",1016323200,10,2656,4.725108225108225
1732866,5,B000069I1H,"Showtime is the Reality-TV era's answer to Cop/Buddy movies like the Lethal Weapon series. When a dedicated detective (Robert De Niro) shoots a TV camera during a bust, the Network offers the LAPD a choice: A lawsuit, or the use of De Niro for a reality based show. The camera-shy de Niro is not thrilled, to say the least. And when he finds out that he will be partnered up with Trey ""Ice Trey"" Sellers, a frustrated (Bad!) Actor/Beat Cop, the fur starts to fly.
  Murphy and De Niro are on the trail of a vicious Club Owner who is in posession of a batch of specially made guns; They fire such large rounds that they are capable of knocking down houses. You can imagine what they'll do to a bullet-proof vest...
  Showtime has some really great action sequences; The climax was actually something that I had never seen before in a movie. Points for originality! The real selling point is the pairing of Eddie Murphy and Robert de Niro. The two are priceless when they are onscreen together, and there are more laugh-out-loud moments in this film than I could count. (Sequel, PLEASE!!!!) William Shatner plays himself in a small cameo: He's there to teach the guys how to act like TV Cops- Hood Jumping, Door Rolling, etc. Just the spectacle of seeing Shatner, Murphy & De Niro in the same scene is funny....
  And make sure to stick around for the outtake reel after the film ends. Great stuff! There should be one HELL of a DVD for this film....",1016236800,5,1448,4.50763358778626
