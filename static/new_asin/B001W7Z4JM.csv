8347173,1,B001W7Z4JM,The quality of these transfers is piss-poor and taken from worn-out damaged prints. Mystery of the Leaping Fish was un-watchable. Get these films from some other source. I actually rate this at ZERO stars!,1299283200,6,205,5.0588235294117645

I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated. In this case, only one movie will be reviewed.

Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.

An interesting one. This is  the one by Thomas A. Edison studios. Most people know the character of Frankenstein as the Universal 1931 versions creature. However, this is in fact the first version. As I quote James A. Rolfe (Thomas A Edison, relationship perhaps?) ""We're not @#$%ing around WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1910!"" I just love the way he says it, you've gotta see it. Anyways, so how is it? Well, if you like silent films you should like it. If you don't have that much time on your hands you should like it, it lasts for 12 minutes and 42 seconds exactly. This movie also creates an image of the Monster I've seen nobody try to even be inspired by.

The idea of a clever, fox like monster. See, the sympathetic Frankenstein's Monster is so popular, that's just what everybody goes with. Now, on the other hand, we've got this guy. First off, he looks awesome. Second off, he's got the best creation sequence of the early 1900's and probably up their in the top 10 of all time. It's just awesome, it's worth a watch just too see that. And, it's legal to download! I would suggest Internet Archive myself. Third off, this one delivers the idea of a monster who knows what life is like and doesn't want it. It would be like if someone rose an angel back to earth (or would it be pulled down?)

Yes, the monster hates being alive like the first one, but here, he doesn't try to adapt. Instead, he tries to torture and injure Frankenstein, mostly mentally but sometimes physically. And yes, there is a scene with a mirror analogy (more on it later), but I just can't help but feel these two aren't the same in this movie. Now is later, the last scene is the mirror analogy, and I didn't spoil anything, it didn't deserve to be. They ended it on a low note. That is my only problem, besides their being no real DVD release to speak of. This movie for over 50 years was thought to be a lost film, meaning it was extinct, long gone, didn't even exist. Until it was found in Australia. So, it seems like we're looking at the holy grail, but that in our minds has been replaced with London After Midnight.

Well, I can't deliver too much on a 13 minute movie, but there is my stuff. The Rating? I'd say, a good 3.6/5",1277424000,,2510,4.339019189765459
