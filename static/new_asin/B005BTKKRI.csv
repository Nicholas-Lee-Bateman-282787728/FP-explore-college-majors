8464266,1,B005BTKKRI,"If you know the pentatonic scales and have internet access then you do not need to waste your money on this DVD. It is not really a master class in any sense of the word. Andy introduces the pentatonic scale in a few different positions. He then states that they can be connected and gives and example without any real explanation of how and why they can be connected. He then gives a brief solo that is not note for note of a few different blues rock players breaks it down pretty quickly. That is the DVD. If you know the pentatonic, then you can look on youtube how to solo like Clapton, SRV or your favorite picker.",1378944000,4,619,4.254237288135593
