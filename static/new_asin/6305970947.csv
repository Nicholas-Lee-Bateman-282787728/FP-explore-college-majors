This would be great for toddlers, preschoolers, even grade school kids will have fun with this. The 'Baby Songs' title can be misleading, as it's clearly for all ages of kids. But if you know the 'Baby Songs' series, its the great songs of Hap Palmer that kids are immediately drawn to, with these follow-along active beats. My lil guy was nearly out of breath by the last song, bouncing all around the house. The video is short, and easily rewound and played again. Atleast that's what my son requests. And any fun learning video that keeps him this active is fine with me to watch again!",1424995200,,702,4.366412213740458
7899084,4,6305970947,"I have seen many of the Kidsongs videos in the past 13 years.  Although this one is not my favorite, it still has great songs for kids and has that special appeal of the other Kidsongs videos.  These videos, although older, are a refreshing break from Barney, Blues Clues, and Disney.  The best feature is probably the length, which is just the right amount of time for the attention span of those who enjoy then the most-the kids.",970790400,7,431,4.5
