Truly remarkable film that brings humanity to an inhumane situation, 14 June 2008
Author: vaucluse88 from San Francisco CA

Fortunate to have seen ""Something is Killing Tate"" today, screened as part of the 10th annual San Francisco Black Film Festival. An amazingly complex and heart rending story that manages to have a happy ending where one would normally never be imagined. Director/writer/exec producer Leon Lozano has produced a dynamic story filled with characters we wish we could say aren't real...but life tells us differently. This film merits every award it has won and damn well better win some more! Today it won two major awards, the best feature film award and the overall grand prize, the Melvin Van Peebles Award. Knowing Melvin, he would and should be proud.

See this film. Support this film. Make sure this film is seen by audiences the world over. It may have been made by a black filmmaker but it is a story that rings sadly true no matter what your color or culture. Shine the light, tell the tale, and make sure this is not the last we hear/see of M. Lozano.

Brilliant!

This is real independent film-making, 23 March 2008
Author: magdub from United States

This film played to sold out crowds at the Pan African Film Festival and I can see why. The film presents an amazing cast which really brought this story to life. I appreciated how the director managed to make an entertaining movie with such a difficult subject without ever going over the top or trivializing the situation. ""Something Is Killing Tate"" hits you with shocking and exciting revelations while still managing to tell a complete quality story with poignant moments. I found it refreshing to see a film made by up-and-coming filmmakers that manages to do both.

Powerful-Simple-Brilliant-Authentic - A definite must-see, 26 July 2008
Author: Daniel (dlpurch@bellsouth.net) from Atlanta, GA, United States

I just had the privilege of ""witnessing"" and sharing this powerful and moving film. I have to say, that it is simple in design, complex in performance and brilliant in it's natural authenticity. It is not a film that patronizes it's subject matter or characters, but is probably the first time that I have seen true representations of male depression along with the constellation of fear and other emotions that envelop those around him, without being maudlin or clich. The writer/director captures the energy of numbness in the main character, Tate (a fantastic performance by the way). The supporting characters are each portrayed with an honesty and depth that independent film (or mainstream for that matter) has rarely seen.

I also want to underscore one important point. This is a film that has an emotional heart that a man can understand. So often in films dealing with such highly charged and emotional issues, filmmakers create men who are more ""iconic;"" TATE is real and as an African-American man myself can honestly say that I have never seen such a real and authentic African-American man on screen; struggling in the way he does made it truly relatable to (I believe) every man. I would strongly encourage other men to not write this movie off as any type of ""chick flick"" (a term I loathe but it's in the lexicon). Brothers and men...you will feel this one...in your heart, body and soul!

Visually, the film uses light and dark, touchstones of color so well that it truly set's the mood for this exploration into the soul of a man and the horror that isn't as uncommon as one might think or want. I am so impressed with this film because it actually understands why and how film can and should be used to tell a story. At just 80 minutes, the pace is just right and the Director doesn't cheat...doesn't allow any one-dimensional portrayals and certainly doesn't solve or pretend to have ""the answer."" It's not a Hollywood version of the truth of this situation; what the director, actors and crew have done is allow the audience to witness ""a"" truth for Tate, his families and friends which then allows those of us who have seen it to begin the real work of healing in our own lives.

Incredible Subject Matter & Acting, 2 August 2008
Author: songstressiii from United States

As a lover of cinema, I'm rarely in a position to give KUDOS to first-time independent features because the quality is rarely up to par, given that their budgets are limited. Such is not the case with ""Tate"". This film was well executed from the lighting to the acting to the content/topics covered. I applaud the Director, producer and team for a job well-done. The sensitive nature of the subject matter was handled both delicately AND thoroughly to inform the viewer of the very REAL atrocities that face our children every day in this country. I attended the viewing that was held in Atlanta during the National Black Arts Festival to support actress (and Spelman Alumna) Robin Dionne, whose contribution as the Mother of the main character was indeed a powerful support to the film. I absolutely applaud the efforts of the entire team that worked on this production from conception to viewing. KUDOS!!!

Great Movie!, 9 June 2008
Author: mhb1970 from United States

I saw ""Something is Killing Tate"" this past weekend at the Black Hollywood Film Festival in LA and by far it was the best picture I saw. The storyline was gripping, the cast was excelling and the production was of a very high quality. The film did not come across as an independent film but rather something of studio quality. I highly recommend this movie for both the relevancy of the storyline and way it is told. Many viewers will be surprised at how the story unfolds and the shocking nature of the situations.

Kudos to the cast members for displaying raw emotions which helped to bring the viewers into the storyline. I felt the pain of the lead character ""Tate"" and empathized with his struggles. The mother was also someone somewhat of a ""tragic"" figure but then as the movie progresses you can no longer feel sorry for her.",1243555200,7,7368,5.136894824707847
