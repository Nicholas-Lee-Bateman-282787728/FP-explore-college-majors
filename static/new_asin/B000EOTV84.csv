8112269,3,B000EOTV84,"I didn't realize how bad talentless some acts and movies were but I guess everyone had to start somewhere. Step and fetchit  was the old ""dumb"" stereo type no one would stand for today, thank goodness.",1291939200,,201,4.583333333333333
8112270,4,B000EOTV84,"Louis Jordan, the terrific vocalist/alto sax player/bandleader, demonstrates those immense talents and displays his acting chops in this pleasing film ""Look Out Sister,"" which includes a classic dream sequence complete with western roping, horseriding, and bad guys trying to steal property rights because of the secret discovery of that demon, petroleum. The musical performances are of the highest quality and are filmed in a straightforward manner. All in all, a five star film. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for ""Big Timers,"" a showcase for Stepin Fetchit, one of America's greatest (and earliest) black actors. This movie just doesn't provide enough opportunity to witness Fetchit's comedic talents. The music and dance segments are not strong. Worth watching for historical value but short on entertainment.",1259020800,9,822,5.637096774193548
