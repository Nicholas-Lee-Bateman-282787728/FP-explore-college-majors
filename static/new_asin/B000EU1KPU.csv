8114329,4,B000EU1KPU,"It's hard not to take notice of Rory's fight with his health on this video as he is quite evidently not a well man at this stage, however it should be remembered that Cork was often the final venue of an extensive tour when Rory would wind down and spend some time back in his home town.

He plays with all the panache one would expect and his home crowd are appreciative if a little subued, fans weren't getting any younger either.  All the favourites are here with an especially great version of 'Tattoo'd Lady' and the solo 'Out on the Western Plain'.  Mark Feltham looked a little distracted at times but Gerry McAvoy worked feverishly to get the audience going.  The band have always been tight and sensitive to the fact that it's Rory they've paid to see.  That is not meant to devalue them or their sensational playing.

If you don't own a video/DVD of Rory in concert then perhaps check out Irish Tour first or Montreux, both are excellent.  Live in Cork can be difficult when one is fully aware that Rory would not be with us long after this recording and at times he does look uncomfortable but, as always, the music is top notch and Rory delivers.",1243123200,16,1158,4.433962264150943
8114330,3,B000EU1KPU,"Let me start by saying that over the past few months I purchased 8 CDs and 3 DVDs of Rory's music.  Most everything is stellar, and I was looking forward to watching Live at the Cork Opera House.  The DVD arrived several weeks after ordering and I could not wait to give it a listen.  The packaging looked nice,  but when I inserted the DVD it would not play (wrong region...I assume this was a European DVD).  I had to settle for the computer to check it out.  It was immediately clear that Rory was not on top of his form this night.  He was beginning to show the effects of pills and drinking by this time (1987), and his energy and focus are low for most of the show.  Even so, the playing is still brilliant at times, especially towards the end.  Maybe because he was relieved to be putting it behind him, because I had the feeling that he was a bit embarrassed about his condition and knew that he was not as sharp as years past.  That said, there is still some great music and the band holds up their end of the bargain with some particularly excellent harmonica work from Mark Feltham.  But I have to say that this was not the Rory that I was hoping to see.  I am spoiled on Irish Tour '74, and do not enjoy watching watching him deteriorate during the late 80s.  I would also have liked to hear some commentary from the other band members, but none was provided.",1203811200,15,1371,4.226923076923077
