7937930,5,B00005BJOK,"Quite simply put; this is the MOST UNDER-APPRECIATED FILM EVER . It is without a doubt one of the most clever, hilarious, spot-on comedies in film history. Beautifully shot in LA, (but my goodness; it sure looks like beautiful downtown Canada!) Jokes? Well, all anyone needs to know is that it stars Howie Mandel. Do you NEED anything else? If it has any flaws, and I don't think it does, it's that some of the actors are out-classed by the others. For example, the casting of the older man, some dude named Sterling Hayden, (sounds like a foreign currency.  ""How much is that vase, sir?"" ""Why, it's fifty pounds Sterling Hayden!"") not a good choice. And, since that actor hasn't appeared in anything recently,  I'm lead to believe other people agree with me, too.  And who is that DJ? Granted, his witty on-air banter is pitch perfect, (he goes, he goes ""You're all right, you're okay. You've got the Nozzle Nick."" ....but I've never seen him before. If I didn't know any better I'd SWEAR that Kiefer Sutherland used HIS time machine to age himself, then go BACK in time to appear in this film. That disc jockey is the spittin' image of an older Keifer.

I don't want to ruin your viewing by telling you the great jokes contained, but I'll tell you just a couple. In one scene, two characters are running downstairs, and they almost run into a fat guy. To of the blue ( and you might want to hold your stomachs so your guts don't fall out of your body after reading this, the guy goes, ""Hey, I'm Larry Mundello. You guys seen the Beav?""

I'm sorry. I had to sit down for an hour after typing that because the tears from laughing too hard were making it hard for me to see. And a we all know, it's not too safe to drive when you can't see. So, I had to pull my Vega over to the shoulder.  Now that I'm finished crying, I can drive and finish this review.

It makes me very angry though. I mean, Robert Altman gets all this praise. Yeah. Like he's the one who invented having a long cast list and disparate scenes strung together like his famous turkey ""Mashville,"" I think it's called. Now there was a movie I hated. I hated it because when I rented it, the movie inside the box was a different movie altogether! Why would Altman do that? I mean, I rent one of his movies, and it turns out that he tricked me, and made me watch Lady and the Tramp. Maybe Altman didn't want people to watch his infamous turd of a movie because he knew that everyone would call it a ""Gas"" ripoff, which it most certainly is. Look at the poster for ""Mashville,"" then look at the cover art for ""Gas""! Hmmmm
And I think that disc jockey (wait...thinking about him makes me feel like I may have to pull over again. No...I'm going to keep driving. I got a long way to go, and a short time to get there. I'm eastbound. Boy! Watch the Bandit run! Really! Watch him!) looks like the guy from Altman's stinky Korean War movie.

Yeah, that's right! Altman ripped off his entire career from this movie! I can hear you saying it right now that okay, maybe ""Gas"" came out way after those Altman films. But how do YOU know that Altman didn't have a time machine, go to the future, watch ""Gas"" a million times, then go back and make his monstrosities? You don't know that. Maybe he did.

I'm getting sleepy. I think I'll end this review. But first let me type this: If you want a comedy, and you are someone who prefers their comedy to make them laugh, then this is the movie for you, my friend. It's got everything but the kitchen sink! (I never understood what that saying rant. Can anyone help me?""",1354492800,,3567,4.327844311377246
