2466820,4,B000CNGCB6,"I'm great fan of Sex and the city. I don't have whole series, but wanted to collect just few episodes.
This DVD has episodes like
1. Sex and the city
2. Ex and the city
3. I heart NY

I loved these all. Worth buying if you are fan.",1252713600,,231,3.7142857142857144
2466821,1,B000CNGCB6,"If you think this is a dvd just about the series fashions you will be as disappointed as I was.  This disc is just reruns of old tv episodes.  And not even well-chosen.  I wish they would do a real fashion dvd using clips from the series and moderated by Sarah Jessica and Patricia Fields.  Now, THAT would be a winner!!",1241827200,11,320,4.19672131147541
2466822,5,B000CNGCB6,"First allow me to be fair and say, I don't own this particular DVD. I do however own all 6 seasons of Sex and the City (including part 2 of season 6) which share the same episodes though of course not the same amount of episodes. That being said, I think if you'd like to see what all the fuss is about regarding the show, these cheap DVD's are your best bet. Also if you have a friend/family member who you'd like to get hooked on the show this would be a great gift.
I was thoroughly turned off by the show for a long time because TBS and other networks were showing choppy/censored episodes and all of the time (overkill), but I've now fallen in love with my ""favorite"" girls allover again.",1182988800,2,693,4.2180451127819545
2466823,5,B000CNGCB6,"why do people give 1 star reviews for a product they didn't buy?  This dvd is only 4.97 right now, that's a great deal to buy for someone who is a sex and the city fan!!",1172620800,,169,3.6944444444444446
2466824,1,B000CNGCB6,really save your money and buy the full season sets. why would they put these out after they have the full seasons out there to buy?,1148428800,12,132,4.115384615384615
2466825,1,B000CNGCB6,"i don't care for the show,but even so you really save more money buying the full season sets. i don't know why they put these out!!!",1148428800,6,132,4.115384615384615
2466826,1,B000CNGCB6,Big disappointment!  Three episodes wasn't much.  What can I say?  Don't buy it!  Gail Leavitt,1139788800,22,94,5.066666666666666
2466827,3,B000CNGCB6,"An interview, trivia, pics, any special features would have been nice, but rehasing the same old stuff is not. On another note though if they did add new features to these dvds it would make die-hard sex and the city fans have to buy these again. So maybe its a catch-22.",1139616000,16,271,4.333333333333333

8099665,5,B000CNGCB6,"Very entertaining, and, at my age, I can relate to practically every scenario in every single episode -- one way or the other. I love the candor expressed and that they ""tell it like it is"".",1491955200,,190,4.305555555555555

8099673,1,B000CNGCB6,These DVD's essentials are not really worth bothering with. For instance this one is 3 episodes featuring Mr Big. The episodes included in my opinion are not the best of the Carrie/Big storyline.  I would not buy any of the others in this series.,1325635200,,246,4.590909090909091
