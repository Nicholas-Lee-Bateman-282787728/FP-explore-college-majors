3134329,5,B0014T8CDI,"This documentary is only partially a present-day peek into the massive, crumbling underground relics left over from the Nazi's attempt to protect its ammunition, fuel, weapons, treasures and leaders.  It's also a devastating testimony of the many thousands of slave laborers who were forced to build them under murderously brutal conditions. This sensitively-done explanation of the history of these structures gives a more rounded perspective and the viewer isn't allowed to be impressed with the scale of them without being reminded of the price people paid to build them.

The first Half of the documentary focuses on underground factories and storage facilities. Built to help protect sensitive and valuable weapons, fuel and ammunition, they were often the target of allied bombings despite attempts to camouflage them.  I found it fascinating to learn that some of these facilities are still being used today. The second half focuses on structures that protected people -- air raid shelters for the German public and elaborate and sometimes sumptuous bunkers for high-ranking Nazi officials.

Being able to go inside these structures, sixty years after they were abandoned, was absolutely fascinating. The engineers who led the tours gave interesting descriptions of what we were seeing. Interspersed with the present-day tours were footage of the sites during construction and use during the war as well as interviews from survivors who were forced to work on and in them.

I would highly recommend this documentary to anyone who wants to learn more about the staggering plans the Nazis had to win the war via underground missile sites and bunkers, as well as those interested in learning more about the experiences of the Holocaust victims and survivors forced to work toward making the plans a reality.",1342656000,,1811,5.29616724738676
3134330,5,B0014T8CDI,"I had to laugh at the review that said this was a dull show.  It's about factories built  underground during the war by the nazis. They pick different places and go there today and filmed it and then interspace it with vintage footage. What were they expecting?  A fast paced action show?  Explosions?  I don't know but the fact is that they do not veer from telling the truth about what happened building all the various Nazi underground tunnels and factories. The used slave labor and basically worked many of them to death. The nazis and even the civilians involved acted with the most cruelty they could in this endeavour. The show is a overview and picks various sites to explore and to talk about. Most of them are factories but a few are living areas and bunkers and bomb shelters. The mountain where hitlers bergoff is probably one of the few featured in this documentary film that wasn't built by slave labor.  I found it very interesting and well done. This was a german production and they use English speakers for narration in this version. If you don't find documentaries about old underground tunnels and factories from world war two interesting then don't watch this one, but if you are curious then this one is a good overview of the more than 800 major sites known. Including a system under a castle that was for the heads of the nazi state.  Lots of factories and a gun site in france for the supergun that the british blew up before it could be used.  Several v rocket building sites and other sites too.  One of the sites is still used today as a storage and repair facility in modern germany and it's interesting to see that site and be granted access to it.  That reminded me of when I toured ""cheyenne' mountain' in colorado springs, back when it was still in use as the head of norad. IT's now a site for top secret computers and and other things and Norad is on peterson Airbase in a simple building. Which is cheaper I guess and the mountain now only has a skeleton crew to man it. Unless there's a stargate in there!  I love exploring ruins and would even like to explore caves so this was a good two hours of informative informaion for me.  The dvd looks great too as this was mainly filmed in the last ten years. The extras are few though.",1327536000,3,2268,4.43855421686747
3134331,4,B0014T8CDI,"I wasn't expecting much from this title, I figured that it would be somewhat like the other boring documentaries going through a few abandoned nazi tunnel systems...To my pleasant surprise this is actually very interesting, I did not know that so many underground tunnel systems built by the reichs forced labor programs were still in use today...I was astonished with the speed that these massive systems were built to be in production order for the last 2 years of the war, listing and showing underground nazi tunnels that would have been otherwise impossible to see with the naked eye..Some of these were so hidden that you may not even know that you were walking on enormous underground tunnels and rooms that were once the secret production areas of weapons like the first guided missile, the V1-V2 rockets.. Also the first fully operational jet propelled plane, the Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwalbe...This documentary will take you on a guided tour of these Gargantuan tunnel systems, explaining how jewish and other ethnic forced labor workers built these marvels dug literally into a mountain hollowing it out... You find other useful information like how most were mainly only half completed due to germanys defeat in ww2 and how some of these huge rooms and systems were completed by the post-war german government and are now used to house heavily guarded material, aviation fuel, technology and even home of some of todays german army....

Overall this is thoroughly enjoyful, it is still today a testament to (though ruthless) the third reichs ability to achieve some of the first technological marvels of the modern world.. You grasp the understanding of how well protected those secrets were and also see that even after so many years, nazi germany was the creator of the worlds first guided missile, jet plane and (""also they were the inventors of the Sturmgewehr 44, the worlds first assault rifle"") also touching on much of the underground munitions capabilities of the reich...

This is worth watching even just to see some of the condition of these tunnels, some not used since the fall and others well, you see modern cars driving through....

Hitler, in an attempt to protect his production capacity, authorized with his leaders, hundreds of millions of ReichMarks to build underground caverns for the purpose of preserving the building of the German war machine.

We see scenes throughout occuppied Europe, including tunnels still in use as well as ones that were destroyed by bombing raids.  Interestingly, we meet one of Adolf Hitler's body guards, who tours us around the site of the major Valkerie assassination attempt.

In color, black and white and with old war footage, we see the lairs of Goebbels, and Hesse, additionally, we see actual family members of Goebbels in their bunker just before they were killed by their parents.

Thousands of lives (many of them were POW's) were lost in this effort. After being closed to the public for many decades, they have been reopened to show the world. There always is the question of 'what if' they had succeeded in building plants that were safe from the Allies' bombs. We will never know. A more pertinent question today might be 'where' could this be going on in the world with rogue nations building secret weapons or other potentially lethal or illegal operations. Even our country has deep underground facilities connected with the military and critical defense operations. A fascinating world to think about and explore.

I can not imagine how anyone could possibly adjust to such conditions.  I question why a body guard was given the respect to appear here while those people who were forced to build these hideouts for the weasels of the time died by the thousands and not before going through horrible tragedy, losing family, homes, and sanity.  It was a horrible time for all people involved.
This brings to mind the similarity of the present American government which is continually placing rules and regulations on its own people even as to what can be stated in our ""free"" country, which to me is a reflection of fear Americans have of their own government.  Do you think it is going to become less restrictive?  I see a distinct relationship here, as anyone could.  We have prisons being built and owned by private ""citizens"" in our own country, and prisoners who are guilty of attempting to cure their own ailments by use of a God given weed, and I know of many pain patients who are not getting pain coverage because the DEA, who takes no oath to ""first do no harm"",  claims to know what is best for patients.  This is very similar to Germany 1939, when those who are not affected sleep.  Wake up America!!!",1456617600,,1495,4.80859375

It was truly a massive undertaking requiring the most advanced engineering.  It was a system of underground bunkers demanding thousands of slave workers who lived and died there.  Of course besides the tunnels for production there were the bunkers for the Nazis themselves to live in... if necessary for months.

We have prisons being built and owned by private ""citizens"" in our own country, and prisoners who are guilty of attempting to cure their own ailments by use of a God given weed, and I know of many pain patients who are not getting pain coverage because the DEA, who takes no oath to ""first do no harm"",  claims to know what is best for patients.  This is very similar to Germany 1939, when those who are not affected sleep.  Wake up America!!!",1456617600,,1495,4.80859375

It is amazing how quickly some of the installations were constructed but at a tremendous human cost to the forced labor. I'm surprised that more of the installations haven't been repurposed. Hitler waited too late in the war to implement this plan like many other mistakes he made, otherwise the European war could have dragged on for another 6 months.",1419292800,,447,4.973333333333334

This gives you a clear picture that had it not been for a lot of bad decision making at the top, the skill, determination, and will power of Germany could have prevailed in WWII.

3368890,5,B0014T8CDI,"This was an excellent video describing the underground system of bunkers that the Nazis had built, and were still building at the end of  WW11.  I had never realized that they had built complete underground factories for producing planes, for germ warfare development as well as chemical gas research and development and V2 rocket production.  It was truly a massive undertaking requiring the most advanced engineering.  It was a system of underground bunkers demanding thousands of slave workers who lived and died there.  Of course besides the tunnels for production there were the bunkers for the Nazis themselves to live in... if necessary for months.  A truly amazing feat in my estimation.",1402963200,,695,5.160714285714286
