8285149,4,B001BXRRHE,"Although the material covered is similar, this video biography of John Steinbeck is far better than the one produced by Kultur, which is sparse on visuals and narrated by a Brit with a weak ear for American idiom. Peter Jones's version, on the other hand, is visually vital, emotionally compelling, and convincingly narrated by the actor Liev Schreiber. I recommend it for any school class or age group reading Steinbeck, the most American of modern American authors, for the first time.",1347840000,,487,5.0246913580246915
