7902079,5,B00000215K,"T. D. Jakes is a master at interpreting biblical narrative and applying it to modern day life challenges. I've looked at him throughout the years and this message stands out. He takes the congregation through the process that Jesus used to select his diciples and compared it to what he would do if he (Jakes) had ""but 12 men"" and limited time to turn the world around. Then he gets into the meat of the sermon where he talked about the broken disciples on the boat fishing all night....They were going through the motions but they had given up. He reached out to the audience and made the point that so many of us are ""washing our nets"" where we are going through the paces but inside we have given up...on our marriages, our jobs, our children, our communities, our friendships...And the key point of the message is what peter said to Jesus on the boat when Jesus asked them to throw their empty nets back out. It's a crucial step of faith and he calls us to do the same to overcome our places of failure. Fantastic message for anyone struggling with some sort of failure.",1327968000,,1074,4.456852791878172
