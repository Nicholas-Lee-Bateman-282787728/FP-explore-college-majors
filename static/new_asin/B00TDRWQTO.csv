8701262,5,B00TDRWQTO,"Robson Green is back with new adventures and experiences in Northumberland. This season we see Industrial Age marvels brought to life and ancient species of cattle protected in remote countryside. Most interesting for fans may be the wildlife enjoying a morning plunge as nature intended into the icy waters of Druridge Bay.
If you can't get enough of Britain's most beautiful assets you are sure to love the second season.
