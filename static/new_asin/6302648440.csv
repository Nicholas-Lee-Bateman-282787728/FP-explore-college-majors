493861,5,6302648440,It was nice to be able to see a film that actually shows you what a disabled person goes through in certain situations. Any little bit helps!!!!,1308441600,,144,4.37037037037037
493862,5,6302648440,"It's funny how your life can change in a second... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening, and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on.

Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. A film simple and at the same time deep that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: enjoy each moment of your life...

Really to a film as that the any hour is not attended!!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...).",1122163200,2,750,4.467153284671533

493864,4,6302648440,"This film never received the attention it deserved, although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting, and one of the most realistic stories I have seen on screen. Clearly filmed on a small budget in a real V.A. Hospital, the center of the story is Joel, very well-played by Eric Stoltz. Joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident, and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have spinal injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, his married lover, played by Helen Hunt, who shows early signs of her later Academy-Award winning work.
Although the Joel-Anna relationship is the basic focus, there are many other well-developed characters in the ward. Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job as the angry Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as the bitter and racist Bloss. I think Forsythe's two best scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers, and, later, when he feels empathy for a young Korean man who has been shot in a liquor store hold up. My favorite scene with Snipes is the in the roundtable discussion of post-injury sexual options.
The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong, and they have two very intimate, but not gratuitous, sex scenes. The orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing. There is also another memorable scene where Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the specially-equipped van to the strip bar. It's truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the ""naked ladies.""
The story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director, Neal Jimenez, is paralyzed in real life. This is basically his story. This film is real, not glossy or flashy. To have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing. I recommend this film to everyone I see, because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look. It's a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked, but through video, perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves.",1040515200,12,2011,4.558011049723757
493865,5,6302648440,"As a person with severe mobility impairment, I viewed this picture with interest.  I give it my fullest recommendation.  It is definitely the best motion picture I have seen on the subject of serious disability and the adaptations required by those who deal with it.  Some succeed, some don't, but the movie tells its story with accuracy and compassion.",1011484800,16,353,4.9491525423728815
493866,2,6302648440,Early Helen Hunt. Basically this is a film about a room full ofmen learning how to live physically challenged.  Helen Hunt is tornbetween two lovers.  She's pretty convincing.  I seriously doubt I'd view this film more than once.  The film moves very slowly and lacks character development.  You basically know nothing about the two lead characters other than the fact they're sexually involved with each other and Eric Stoltz broke his neck hiking.  The ending leaves you wondering...what happens now?  The best scenes were the love scenes involving Helen Hunt and Eric Stolz.  The love scene in the hospital takes the cake.....very well done.,953942400,5,644,5.125

7829160,5,6302648440,"I spent 6 months after my paralyzing accident at rehab facility this was filmed (Rancho Los Amigos) in 1986.  If anything, this writer's experience (and it is based on a true story) is better than mine was.  Throw Me Before You in the garbage.  This is real life.

7829161,5,6302648440,Excellent very happy with the movie.  Tracking stunk though,1496275200,,59,5.555555555555555
7829162,2,6302648440,"Pro: The movie centers on characters with physical disabilities.

Cons: There's not much of a story here. We know virtually nothing about anyone in the film from the beginning to the end. Joel Garcia is a writer (of what? from where? ) who breaks his neck hiking (how exactly? ) and becomes paralyzed from the waist down. He's in the hospital. His girlfriend, Anna (Helen Hunt), is married (to someone else) and comes to visit Joel all the time. We are never given any further information about her. Joel wants Anna to leave her husband. They argue about it. Meanwhile Joel befriends two other men (Westley Snipes and William Forsythe) who are also paralyzed and are recovering in the same ward. Everyone struggles to cope with their new differently abled status. At the end, Anna leaves her husband to be with Joel, but then Joel tells her to stay with her husband and they can just be friends. Anna cries. When Joel becomes ready to leave the hospital, Anna picks him up (are they together?  It's unclear).

There. I've just told you the whole movie. Like previous reviewer studiorow, I probably won't watch this a second time.",1468972800,,1129,4.720812182741117

7829168,5,6302648440,"This is an excellent movie. It was released on December 18, 2001 almost 11 years ago by a major studio Sony Pictures.
My question is why does this dvd cost so much to purchase ? This dvd is only 11 years old and yet it cost $79.09(New)
and $47.97(Used). Sony Pictures has a SCREEN CLASSICS BY REQUEST DEPARTMENT, So again, my question to Sony Pictures is why does
this dvd cost so much?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Waterdance/dp/B00005RDRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Waterdance</a>",1323302400,,530,5.896103896103896
