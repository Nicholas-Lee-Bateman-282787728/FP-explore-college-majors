1885463,5,B00009N84D,"I first saw this movie by chance on a flight from DC to London. It was 2:00 am in my home time zone, but once the movie started I was wide awake till it ended. So much about this movie is so deep, intellectually and emotionally. The acting and photography are sublime. One of the best movies I've seen in years.",1065484800,9,311,4.114754098360656
1885464,5,B00009N84D,"This film was not critically acclaimed and for the life of me I'm trying to figure out why.  Thankfully, I decided to get this movie based on the actors and what sounded like an interesting premise.  I'm very greatful that I did.
The storyline is told in a dual manner switching betweent the present and flashbacks.  Some have stated that the pace is slow- well this isn't an action flick (thankfully), yet the story consumed me and I never felt like it was dragging.
Guy Pearce plays a shrink who is coming home to bury his father, with whom he had a very spotty relationship with.  Upon his return, we learn of his childhood and the events of a girl that have haunted him into adulthood.  Helena Bonham Carter plays a mysterious woman who may or may not be real (the girl) who aids in the healing process.
The film's ending is one that is open to interpretation, yet powerful regardless of your ultimate conclusion.
In all, a great film that deals with loss, regret, breaking free from parental molds and the healing process in trying to move forward in life.",1061164800,3,1061,4.534031413612565

If you don't have the patience to sit and allow the rain, the stars, and the moonlight in this movie to wash over you you probably won't get the ending anyway.  This movie is for people with poetry in their soul and who can spend an evening lying on the grass watching the stars.

I was touched on many levels by this film, and I highly recommend it.",1059782400,2,365,4.171428571428572
1885467,4,B00009N84D,"Written and directed by award-winning Australian filmmaker Michael Petroni (Tresspasses, Addicted), Till Human Voices Wake Us is a slow, dreary, and fascinating mystery starring Guy Pearce and Helena Bonham Carter, who deliver dazzling performances as always. It's a supernatural romance that tells the story of a psychologist (Pearce), who, upon returning to his childhood home to bury his dead father, encounters a mysterious woman (Carter), who evokes memories of a long-lost love.
Fair warning: Till Human Voices Wake Us is not a good choice for people who prefer films that move quickly or make a lot of noise. So restrained is this Australian import that it flirts with outright sluggishness. But a close reading reveals that its reticence is more a charm than a disorder. Petroni's script draws from the poetry of T.S. Eliot, particularly ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."" The movie title comes from that poem; it is a fragment of a line that ends ""and we drown."" Petroni is enthralled with the imagery of drowning, which he uses to reveal as much about the character's hearts and minds as about their life stories. Imperfect though it is, Till Human Voices Wake Us delivers a graceful bow to the power of hope.

Till Human Voices Wake Us is beautiful in it's imagery and cinematography, music, acting and writing. It has so many themes which resonated with me on such a deep level. Themes such as look at how we deal with traumas in our life and how they impact on who we become as an adult. Themes about looking at the patterns of behaviour passed down from generation to generation and the huge difficulty in breaking those patterns. Perhaps most important to me was the message that you have to work through your past in a positive way so that you can be free to live your future.
The characters are so beautifully created and the subtlety of the performances are just so moving. It's amazing how a glance or a breath can convey so many words and feelings. The film provided an absorbing and wonderful experience. Recommended for movie lovers, not just those looking for two hours of entertainment.",1057363200,54,2114,4.823691460055096

1885544,2,B00009N84D,"Guy Pearce is a psychologist (Dr. Sam Franks) who returns to Australia from his teaching position in London for his father's funeral. He returns reluctantly because of a tragic memory associated with the place where he grew up. He meets Helena Bonham Carter on a train traveling home for the funeral.  She disappears from the train and Pearce doesn't see her again until he saves her from a suicide attempt. Her name is Ruby and to go further with the significance of the name would be to reveal the movie's secret.

Ruby does and says a number of things that remind Franks of a very painful part of his past. The problem with this is that the time spent in flashbacks limits the amount of screen time for Pearce and Bonham Carter. This movie is overloaded with flashbacks to a fault. I'm not sure how Guy Pearce and Bonham Carter received top billing except that they provide the box office star power to draw an audience.

Most of the acting and screen time is taken by two youthful actors used in the flashbacks.  Lindley Joyner plays young Sam Frank and Margot Knight plays Silvy Lewis, his youthful love interest. They spend most of their time on a bicycle playing word association games and creating other memories that come back to haunt Pearce after his return home.  I did not purchase this movie to see them.  I bought it to see Pearce and Bonham Carter, both very accomplished actors.

The flashbacks are much too numerous to maintain the pace of the movie and so even though it only runs 101 minutes, it seems to go on and on.  The lack of screen time for the stars and the slow pace of the movie make for a less than enjoyable movie experience.  The secret revealed at the end is not surprising and the resolution of the problem it poses is not effective. I can't recommend this one.",1337385600,,1796,4.501538461538462
1885545,5,B00009N84D,"A hauntingly beautiful film about human alienation and how the mind deals with guilt. Yet another true masterpiece of Australian cinema.

There is so much imagery in the movie that it is difficult to know where to start in describing it, but the brilliantly filmed uses of water are the centerpiece. When Guy Pearce's character is finally able to lay Silvy's ghost to rest, he does so in symbolic fashion, sending her out on a boat to the Otherworld, just as the Nordic warrior dead were sent out on burning boats to Valhalla. His peace of mind comes in her return to the Earth Mother.

There is a magic about the relationship between the young Sam and Silvy that is captured in a breathtakingly beautiful fashion in this masterpiece of direction.

The title is taken from the last line of T. S. Eliot's The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, which ends, ""Till human voices wake us, and we drown."" There has been a great deal of discussion of what Eliot meant by the poem as a whole and by the enigmatic last line, in particular. My own interpretation, with which I ended the Postscript of my 2009 novel One Star Awake, is that once we stop embracing the Sacred Feminine, the Truth that sustains us is lost... and we `drown' in the illusion of fear, despair and alienation.

Sam's bitter-sweet feelings of loss and desolation are only resolved when he re-dedicates Silvy's soul and memory to the Great Mother, the Universal Consciousness, as symbolized by the water.

1885550,3,B00009N84D,"This movie is sometimes billed as a love story.  It isn't.  It's a story of sorrow and loss.

The R rating is a joke.  Canada gave it a PG, which is accurate.  The one-second nipple shot of Helena hardly merits an R even with up-tight American audiences.

One thing that annoyed me was that the young boy's lips were redder than the young girls (and she was supposed to be wearing lipstick).  Also, hers were normal.  His looked filled with silicone.

The movie is structured as a mystery, which is a good move for a film in which nothing happens.  A mystery keeps it going.  However, the screenwriter should have learned the basics of mystery writing (which he probably never did because he was interested in ""art"" movies).  So, Mystery Writing 101: The mystery should deepen throughout with additional clues.  There should be many red-herring clues to throw the audience off.  None of this was done here.  There is one puzzle: Whot hoppened?  This puzzle is answered at the end.  Many viewers will have guessed it early on anyway (and one helpful amazon reviewer below gives the mystery away).

Bottom line: the movie does not offer the viewer very much.  There is Helena, of course, and there are some touching moments (hence, the three stars), but they are few.",1157932800,,1265,4.69406392694064

1885554,3,B00009N84D,"Poetry's charming attributes -- lyricism, play on imagery, openness to individual interpretation -- are also its liability; what one may like in a poem, another may find vague or simply ignorable.

By that token, Till Human Voices Wake Us has to be one of the most lyrical films I have seen in recent months. Its theme is simplistic at best: a psychiatrist's childhood memories come flooding back when he returns to his hometown for his father's funeral, exacerbated further by a mysterious amnesic woman who reminds him of...well, any reader of this review can guess.

But what sets it apart is the deliberately languid pacing, the haunting visuals that look like preparatory stock for a big-budget music video, the elaborate trance in which the narrative seems to waft. I like Guy Pearce, love Bonham Carter, and together they sport some sizzling chemistry. Australia lends itself to scenic splendor of the highest order.

But the 18-dollar question: do I recommend it? Depends on your taste. If you've sat through Kurosawa's epics or 80s French films, the kind where nothing much appears to happen on screen yet a lot is kindled in your imagination, then you should find enough to savor in this dreamy romance. If not, it may come off as a pretentious, vacuous, or even ultimately confusing endeavor. Your call, I think it's a firm 3 of 5 stars for its radiance alone.",1126396800,10,1371,4.875536480686695
1885555,5,B00009N84D,"NOw, when I watched this the first time, I was in ""movie"" mode-where you basically crunch popcorn loudly and it's no biggie cause most movies tell their stories so overtly.

But I slowly realized this movie (which I believe is adapted from a novel)plays like a moving picture book. It's sorta had a literary feel to it, which made me replay it again after the first viewing to ""pick up"" on all the nuances(not too nuanced but more nuanced than movies usually are).

The second viewing was much more powerful actually, much more gut wrenching, because you pick up on some of the nuances better and the themes of memory and regret and moving on. Now it does move at a slow pace, but not to the point where you want to turn it off. You just have to be a little more patient as most of the ""slow"" parts because their significance tends to pop up later on.

This movie is one of the few movies I've ever teared up on. It is very beautiful, but in a way that isn't corny or ""Hollywood"" like-in a way that recognizes life in all it's sad and all too fleeting beauty. Buy this DVD if you like romantic dramas/mysteries that don't always end with a marriage or a ""and they lived happily ever after.""

Guy Pearce and HElena Bonham Carter, as well as the two child actors, were just amazing, by the way. There is one scene between the two leads that interplay with a flashback, that just rips your heart out......",1125446400,6,1402,4.360153256704981
1885556,5,B00009N84D,"Not only the story being beautiful, the movie is beautifully done in terms of music, images, and story's structure. Similar sweetness and sadness are seen in the movie ""My Girl""(1991).

It appears to be a mystic story, but it is rather realistic when thinking of how humans interpret all situations quite subjectively. The more honestly we live, the more subjective we become. The story itself is very sad, but because of its sadness the movie is painfully beautiful. I would imagine this one can be hard to watch for some people who are dealing with a great deal of grief.",1102377600,6,573,4.73
1885557,4,B00009N84D,"'Till human voices wake us, and we drown.'  This film's title comes from TS Eliot's poem 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock' which the heroine of the film loves to read.  Like Eliot's poem, 'Till Human Voices Wake Us,' small Australian film is moody and intelligent though too slow for some people.

And very romantic.  If you consider yourself a cynical person, don't watch this.  In the summer of small village in Austlaria, a 15-year-old boy Sam comes back from the school.  He meets Silvy again after long years, who is now experiencing a complete change into womanhood.  They spend quiet and blissful time together in the wood, or by the river, like two innocent kids would.  Then, something happens and Silvy is gone forever.

Cue to 20 years later.  Now grown-up Sam (Guy Pearce) , a psychiatrist in Melboune University, receives a note, which brings him back to the village after 20 years.  In this place full of bitter memories, he meets a woman Ruby (Helena Bonham Carter), who lost her memories after the shock of diving into the river.  Sam, trying to help regain her memories, finds himself slowly attracted to her, and himself starts to accept his painful past.

You cannot accuse the film of too thin plot.  The identity of Ruby is not a big mystery from the first, and the film does not attempt to hide the fact.  Writer and director Michael Petroni clearly intends the film to be more atomospheric and symbolic than usual romances, for example, introducing many references to words (Ruby later turns out one such instance).  The water plays significant role, so does butterfly, or the image of 'flying' (the young girl needed an aid to walk).  I don't say they are put in the right places, but the ideas are pretty interesting.

But the most charms of the film come from the two leads, Carter and Pearce, who should stay away from any Sci-fi films in the future (no more apes, please, both of you).  But more remarakable is the young actress Brooke Harman, who played Sylvie, who, in spite of her youth, is curiously seductive.  Do not miss her.

Mostly too slow, and too talky at the same time, but that is the point of the film, which successfully conveys the bitter-sweet feelings of our lost childhood.  And the images are beautiful, and so is Helena Bonham Carter.",1091577600,20,2288,4.6675
1885558,5,B00009N84D,"This film is not predictable because it presents nothing to predict.  From the moment the story opens until the very end we know the plot but what baffles is the outcome, will he or will he not be able to let go of his past?  This question haunts us all the way through the film until the chilling end that leaves you wanting more.

I think Carter was mis-cast, she looks nothing like the young girl and you don't ever get the WHY these 2 were allowed some sort of special dispensation to have another chance and the ending leaves you to decide what the hell happened.  Poetic?  yes, but a bit of a mish mash, worth watching but 3 stars because of the screenwriting.",1518825600,,460,4.518072289156627

In this movie the main character played by Guy Pearce is forced to deal with a tragic event from his childhood when he goes home after his father's death. Every time I watch this movie I cry really hard for a long time, I suppose you could say it's cathartic.
