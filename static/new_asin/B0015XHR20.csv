8260309,5,B0015XHR20,"In mid-winter 1985, Australian viewers were treated to some powerful television. A Country Practice, probably the most popular TV show in Australia at that point, was about to say goodbye to one of the original characters, probably the most popular character, Molly Jones (Anne Tenney). Adelaide born Molly had arrived in Wandin Valley with her husband Brendan (Shane Withington) back at the start of the series and quickly became one of the locals in the Valley. As well as the many weekly stories which defined A Country Practice, the series depicted Molly's long battle with leukemia with alot of care. The methods used to allow other characters to be aware of Molly's imminent death was particularly well done. Although episode 312 can be a tear jerker, there are others preceding this which can bring a tear or two to the eyes.
Along with Shane and Anne (who are married in real life), the acting from Lorrae Desmond, Penny Cook, Brian Wenzel, Shane Porteous, Wendy Strehlow, Grant Dodwell, Joan Sydney, Joyce Jacobs, as well as the late Syd Heylen and Gordon Piper is truly top notch.
As usual the series tackles its fair share of social issues in the set and had it's usual wealth of guest actors recognisable form other 1980's Australian soaps.
Although A Country Practice would go on for another 700+ episodes, Wandin Valley would never have another Molly Jones.",1323129600,,1371,4.913793103448276
