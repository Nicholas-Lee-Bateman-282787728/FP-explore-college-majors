5425856,5,B00AHWB528,"We were wondering if this story might show the killing of prey; however, this story is educational and not gross. Amazing how these animals are recorded in their own environment safely by camera crew and not have the crew end up being the prey. Beautiful scenes of Africa.",1373068800,3,272,4.6875
5425857,2,B00AHWB528,no action !! too short film not  what i espect !! i paid  too much for this not happy!!  i wach beter programs on discovery chanel or NG,1372809600,2,136,3.7857142857142856
5425858,1,B00AHWB528,"First, I agree with those who say the 3D is not good. Only the underwater shots are truly 3D. Don't know the problem on land...some shots seem to be 3D, others not. But that's not the main complaint; it's just a boring documentary. One could see more excitement going to a zoo. The boring commentator tells us what the animals can do and how it's always a matter of survival for them, but we only see them walking or laying around. How many head shots of hippos in the water do you need to see? You can see better stuff on TV. In other words, save your money for something better, which can be just about anything.",1372809600,2,614,4.256410256410256
5425859,1,B00AHWB528,"I was entirely disappointed by Wild Africa.  It contains very few real 3d images.  There are some great underwater shots and a few quick 3d snippets on land but most of it is either entirely 2d or some kind of weird, remanufactured semi 3d that looks like puppets were imposed over landscape footage. My other complaint is the script; this is not National Geographic or Myron Perkins. It is random shots taken in a couple of obscure, plain Jane fields in Africa. The animal shots are repeated like a bad old war movie; the same Messerschmitt bursting into flames over and over again.  It isn't interesting to watch or listen to. How can 3D wildlife in Africa be boring?  This producer has managed to pull it off. Technical background: I have a 2012 Panasonic Viera 65"" flatscreen and I used 4 pairs of 3d glasses, 2 each of Panasonic's glasses and 2 of another brand. I did this just to be certain it was the disk and not my equipment. I switched over and watched a bit of Life of Pi just to be certain and I can't blame my equipment. LOPi looked brilliant but this bowser was pathetic.  Doesn't somebody at Amazon watch these things to maintain some quality control?  Afterall this is not a major studio's production.  Drop this title Amazon",1372636800,13,1242,4.542600896860987
5425860,3,B00AHWB528,"Seemed more like just information on each type of animal, the same information that is repeated in most documentaries about the region. I expected something with a bit more action, fights for survival etc. 3D effects were good though.",1372464000,,234,5.0256410256410255
5425861,3,B00AHWB528,The main thing going for this documentary is the 3D aspect. It does has beautiful photography. But it offers nothing unusual or different. It would be very boring in 2D.,1372464000,,169,4.666666666666667
5425862,2,B00AHWB528,"I ordered this February 2013, and it finally got here in late June 2013.  I was excited to finally get to watch it.  I just imagined that it would be so good.  The 3D was so so, and the nature filming was almost like it was at a zoo.  There was ocean footage, using this to fill up time, since they were few animal scenes left.  I  was hoping this would be something like National Geographic filming, but not even close. Don't waste your money on this, I'm sorry I did.",1372464000,,469,4.0989010989010985
5425863,1,B00AHWB528,"My wife and I have been waiting for this to come out for a while.  We've done two recent Africa trips, and were looking for a good 3D experience to relive some of the memories.  This disc does NOT come through, unfortunately.

The 3D is not bad.  It's not great, but it's there.  I had to validate, though, that it was shot in 3D...it looks more like a conversion.

Where this fails, utterly, though, is the narration.  It's as if the narrator was reading, w/o actually paying attention to what he was matching his narration to (i.e. talking about big cats while the screen is showing ostriches...this happens over and over and over and over).

If they pulled this, redid the narration, and cleaned up some of the transitions, they might have something.  As is, even at $10, it's a waste.

A FAR better 3D disc to watch to both capture phenom 3D and narration done correctly would be IMAX's Born to be Wild.",1372291200,3,907,4.475609756097561
5425864,5,B00AHWB528,This is a great video. I love all the animals. Minnie is so cute in this video. It is best for 3 to 4 year olds. I don't let them use the 3d glasses of course.,1359936000,7,159,3.4444444444444446

5425869,1,B00AHWB528,This DVD would not load and play on 3 separate BR 3D players. Apparently there was nothing on the disc. No manufacturer name on package to call about the issue.,1386547200,2,160,4.366666666666666

5425872,2,B00AHWB528,"3d was just so so.  Not enough animal views they did a lot of underwater stuff, not what I expected in a wild Africa documentary .  Do not recommend at all.  Very disappointed as I pre ordered this had to wait a long time, and not worth it.",1377993600,2,240,3.9583333333333335

5425874,1,B00AHWB528,3D seemed added on and poorly done. Bought only for 3D content. Came across as a redone documentary from the 50's.,1376265600,,114,4.476190476190476

5425876,5,B00AHWB528,"Fast shipping. Excellent quality item! Will recommend to others for sure. For someone who enjoys nature documentaries, this one is ok. The narration is not the most compelling but the 3D is well done.",1375660800,,200,4.911764705882353
5425877,3,B00AHWB528,The film was not informative.  The narrator does not discuss many things that are focused on.  It simply shows the pictures and gives no indept information.,1375574400,,156,4.961538461538462
5425878,3,B00AHWB528,"I was not real happy with it's 3D.. Seemed like parts weren't in 3D, and it was jumpy in parts. After seeing Grand Canyon Adventure and Ocean Wonders I was really disappointed. I'll make sure I check reviews before purchasing another 3D movie.",1375315200,,243,4.674418604651163
5425879,3,B00AHWB528,"however, too many repeat shots. Something that's becoming common these days, 'more 3D' at the expense of repeats and boredom. There was good content, the visuals were good, I just need a little more from an adventure entitled 'Wild Africa 3D'.",1375056000,,243,4.951219512195122
5425880,3,B00AHWB528,"As far as the 3D aspect goes, it is nothing that exciting at all. Overall from the Blu-ray perspective, it is a nice edition at the best.",1374883200,,137,4.111111111111111
5425881,1,B00AHWB528,"This DVD would not play, every time I close the dvd player, it stays in for a few seconds, then it rejects as if someone hit the reject button. It will not play in mt 3D Blu-ray player. Please send me a return label so I can return it for one that will play. My grandbabies were so disappointed because it would not play.

Thanks,

5425883,4,B00AHWB528,Decent some of the 3d is not that effective but overall a nice documentary try running it with the sound off. I found the moderator distinctly boring.,1374278400,,150,4.592592592592593
5425884,1,B00AHWB528,"I pre-ordered this thing thinking the 3d gonna look good judging from the cover. Man I was wrong. No stories, no true 3d, and some clips are not even in HD! My TV doesn't recognized the Blu-ray DVD as a 3D disk.  Do not waste ur money.",1373241600,3,235,4.0
