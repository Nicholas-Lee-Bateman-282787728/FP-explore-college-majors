8534828,2,B00003JRCI,"As a fan of Scott Cole's, from his Abs of Steel 2 video, I was eager to try this lower body workout tape.  What a disappointment.  While the workout itself is okay (a bit on the easy side)the quality of the video looks as if it were shot with a home movie camera.  I also found the chatty banter between Scott and Billie to be excessive, and quite irritating after the first couple of viewings.  The routine is quadricep heavy and completely leaves out hamstrings.  They do touch briefly on calves.  If you workout to your own music or with headphones then this video could be a good beginning tape for you, however I expected better.",971568000,3,634,4.422413793103448
