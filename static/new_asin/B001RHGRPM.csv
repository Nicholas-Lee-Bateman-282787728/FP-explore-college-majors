3776052,4,B001RHGRPM,"Fifteen titles in MILL CREEK's BILLY THE KID 20 MOVIE PACK have never been previously issued by this manufacturer.

The ""Billy the Kid"" movie series recasts an outlaw gunslinger as a hero. The real ""Kid"" wasn't as noble or noted.
Henry McCarty (alias ""William Bonney"")  was gunned down at age 21 and would've faded into obscurity if his killer, Patrick Garrett hadn't published a fictionalized biography, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-AUTHENTIC-LIFE-OF-BILLY-THE-KID/dp/1409910350/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE AUTHENTIC LIFE OF BILLY, THE KID</a>."" Over time, the Kid's legend grew. At last count, 21 men died at his hands. This number is wildly inflated.

As for the cinematic Billy, Buster Crabbe played him in 13 programmers in 1941-43. Many of that number are here, as are Crabbe as Billy 'Sunset' Carson. Al St. John, who's ""Fuzzy"" in this series, was the nephew of Fatty Arbuckle. In the silent era, St. John had a penchant for leaping into the air with legs pointed in opposite directions. Sam Newfield directed all.

Bob Steele was Billy before Mr. Crabbe (Steele later played Pvt. Duffy on TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/F-TROOP/dp/B001CT05TE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">F TROOP</a>). Others who portrayed the Kid include Johnny Mack Brown, Robert Taylor, Audie Murphy, Scott Brady, Paul Newman, Michael J. Pollard, Kris Kristofferson, Val Kilmer and Donnie Wahlberg.

3776104,4,B001RHGRPM,the movie is plain old time western where you know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are something to watch with the family when you don't want a lot of gore and blood,1402963200,,176,3.7837837837837838
3776105,1,B001RHGRPM,"Having seen Bob Steele as Billy the Kid in the movies when I was a kid I was looking forward to seeing his movies again.  Unfortunately, these are pretty much unwatchable.  Bad sound, terrible picture quality and they freeze up.  Takes forever to try to get the movie back to where it was when it froze up and then it freezes up again.  Frustrating.  I can see why they only charge five bucks for this.",1392163200,,402,4.306666666666667

 I would like very much to return the poor picture ones. Can I return them? Furthermore, I was very disappointed for these reasons:
 1) the DVDs not in color rather black and white .
2). The picture was cloudy.",1373846400,,232,4.5
3776107,1,B001RHGRPM,This is the worlds most awfullest westerm movie version of Billy the Kid. I could have made a far better movie seies with my cam corder. Billy the Kid. starring Buster Crap was some awful junk! I would love to return this garbage of movies.,1340409600,,240,4.355555555555555
3776108,4,B001RHGRPM,"I love any type of westerns, older and newer ones. Can't go wrong for the price! Take a chance and purchase this, it is worth it, if you love westerns!",1339459200,,151,4.066666666666666
3776109,3,B001RHGRPM,"This 20 pack is made up of mostly old Buster Crabb black and white movies that were made for children to watch at the movies on Saturday when the cost to go to a movie was a dime.  Each movie has a similar plot with the same villains and the same good guys.  The acting and stunts are of a poor quality, and it takes a real effort for an adult to watch all 20 of them.

However, if you are a student of old black and white film or if you have children in the home it is a good buy to give them plenty of movies to watch that are probably more appropriate than most of the stuff on cable or network TV today.

Mostly these movies consist of poorly choreographed fist fights, shoot outs, a little slapstick comedy, and long chase scenes on horse back, and the good guys always win of course.

Only about half of the movies are about Billy the Kid and they turn him into some kind of Robin Hood or misunderstood knight in a white hat.  Other than a nostalgic look at older films these films have very little adult entertainment value.

Still at this price it is difficult to go too wrong.",1333065600,3,1085,4.113744075829384
3776110,3,B001RHGRPM,"Hilarious to see the different takes on ""Billy the Kid"" character.  HAY, it's just old B/W westerns put straight onto disk - don't expect modern color epics.  Kinda fun for old guys like me that used to pay to see similar films when young.  I keep mine in the DVD player and watch one or two if I can't find anything else worth watching on TV - that's more often than not with the raft of junk on cable these days.  So, it was the material I expected, and it arrived on time and as advertised.",1320796800,2,493,4.104166666666667
3776111,4,B001RHGRPM,"The case that the 4-DVD's came in was cracked and broken when it arrived.  DVD's were not effected, still have not played them all yet.  Can the company send me a replacement case?  It is a special case that holds the DVD's that are in envelopes in the center of the case. It would be great if they could sent me the replacement case which would enable me to store it on a shelf with the rest of my DVD collection.  The movies are great.  The image and sound quality is good.  Having all the movies in one pack cuts down on 20 different cases and saves room on the shelves.",1310428800,,573,4.117117117117117
