1011573,3,630533580X,"""Twilight Zone - The Movie"" is Nothing if not Different. Full of Great Actors and Weirdly Wonderful Storylines, but unfortunately none of them Unravel like you'd hope. (except for one Exceptional Episode)
John Landis, (""The Blues Brothers"" and ""Trading Places"") Steven Spielberg, (""Jurassic Park"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") Joe Dante (""Gremlins"" and ""Small Soldiers"") and George Miller (""The Witches of Eastwick"" and ""Babe"") are all Brilliant, yet Diverse Directors, which they have Proved time and time again with their many films Before and After this Collaboration. Here it seems they just want to have some fun, and create something Strange. If that Was their Intention, They have Succeeded. The film starts strange and gets more so, but it also gets better as it goes along.
First up is John Landis with a Short Comical Prolong (starring Dan Ackroyd and Albert Brooks), followed by his Episode about a Racist man being shown how it feels to be the brunt of his racism. Steven Spielberg's Episode concerns a Retirement village getting their youth back. The Downright Strange award goes to Joe Dante for his entry about a young boy who brings a Strange Woman (Kathleen Quinlan) home to his world, a world he can Control.
The Best has been Wisely saved till last. George Miller's Entry has John Lithgow on a Commercial Airliner battling his Fear of Flying while the Pilots battle Turbulence. When he discovers a Monster on the wing of the plane, tearing it to pieces, he panics and causes much commotion, but no one else ever sees the monster, What can you do. This Episode is by Far the Greatest; it makes everything you've seen (or suffered) before it worth it. John Lithgow gives a Wonderfully Panicked Performance, he is Totally believable at All times. He and Miller make the Absurd story Totally Realistic and Believable. I was glued to the Screen.
You would think that someone only liking One of Four episodes wouldn't recommend it, but I would as Millers episode is Pure Genius, Dante's episode is Pretty Interesting and the other two are at best, Ok. See this Movie, the final episode is Well worth the wait.",987120000,,2134,4.881542699724518
1011574,4,630533580X,Indiana Jones And the Temple of doom's Dan Aykroyd gives a great performance in the films prologue. It was a great classic ending. John Landis Killed Vic Morrow. He was great. Steven Speilberg did a horrible segment. The 3rd segment is okay. The last one with John Lithgow is a great episode. Overall a good Twilight Zone.,978220800,2,322,4.666666666666667
1011575,3,630533580X,"""Hey, ya wanna see something REALLY scary?"" Well, watch another movie. However, Twilight Zone: the Movie was one of my favorite movies of my college years. I enjoyed the original series, but was never a fanatic. What captivated me about this movie, in particular the 3rd and 4th segments, was the atmosphere established by the filmmakers. The first segment with Vic Morrow is undoubtedly the weakest...there were obviously some script changes necessary due to his tragic death, and what we're left with is a predictable, trite, and even cruel story of a bigot who spouts a few angry words at the beginning then pays for it a thousand-fold. It's like watching someone being slowly tortured to learn a lesson then executed at the end just to make SURE he learned his lesson. The second segment is syrupy, but has the wonderful Scatman Crothers and some amusing moments with the old folks turning into kids. The third segment was my favorite. I always thought some of those old cartoons from the thirties were very creepy in their surreal quality, and watching this segment is like watching someone's nightmare of those old cartoons gone berserk. Of interest is the doomed sister, Ethel, who later on became the voice of Bart Simpson...she really DID get stuck in Cartoonland! And the fourth segment is pretty wonderful too, due to a comic twist on the horror provided by the script and John Lithgow's performance. Towering above the entire movie, though, is Jerry Goldsmith's score...one of his best and one of my three favorite film scores of all time. It truly adds to the eerieness of the first, third and fourth segments and while the second section pours on the schmaltzy strings, on its own it makes a GREAT listen with a memorable theme.",972950400,2,1742,4.848993288590604
1011576,5,630533580X,"I read some of the other reviews of this movie. Am I seeing the same film as the rest of you? In 1983 I was swept away by four powerful stories from the madness of racism, to one's ability to re-capture their youth, to a boy's fantasies that horribly come to life, to the sheer terror of an airplane flight gone bad. Sandwiched between the hilariously terrifying quote by Dan Aykroyd, ""Wanna see something REALLY scary?"", and blended with Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful and exciting score that so accurately followed each story truly makes this an absolutely invigorating and riveting movie experience. The story and music at the end of ""Kick The Can"" evokes tears, the weirdness of the folks trapped in the boy's lair evokes laughs, and the terror of the airplane in peril with Goldsmith's thunderous soundtrack behind it brings you to edge of your seat. Vic Morrow's story is a stark vision of the downfalls of prejudice. I rank this film with ""Jedi"" and ""E.T."". One of the top 3 films of the 1980's, and perhaps of all time! Rent it, Buy it & ENJOY!",971481600,,1049,4.614973262032086
1011577,1,630533580X,"What were the producers thinking? A high budget remake of stories from the original Twilight Zone does not get better simply because they are done with newer equipment and effects - sorry.
Three of the four tales are, as  I mentioned, remakes from the original television show (""Kick the  Can"", ""It's a Good Life"" and ""Nightmare at 20,000  Feet""). While the 1959/60/61 shows were good, these suffer in  comparison. The fourth was an original (thank the stars for at least some  originality!) featuring Vic Morrow as a bigot who is hurled into the lives  of those he hates most.
This movie could and should have been a monument  to a series which has weathered more than 40 years and is still fresh (and  popular) today. Instead, it just falls flat.
Recommend you bypass this  movie and simply buy the original television series by Rod Serling on DVD.  You'll be much happier with them.

1011635,5,630533580X,"All four episodes are true to the Twilight Zone series and a classic to have.

1011638,1,630533580X,I was looking up scary movies that kids can watch.  This is rated PG ( so is Poltergeist) it was on the list so I ordered it.  IT IS NOT KID FRIENDLY!!!!!  I had to turn it off in the second scene and the first scene was unacceptable for kids! The guys tape gets stuck in the tape player and he screams JESUS CHRIST over and over.  I told my kids that is not acceptable!  The next scene the guy goes to a bar.  He lost his promotion to a JEW at his job.  He grabs the waitress and pulls her down on his lap and asks if she would like to cheer him up (scumbag).  He starts ranting about this Jew and N***RS that live on his street. Oh my gosh my kids have never heard any of those words before!  Off it went! I'm really disappointed I wasted our money.  I'm really disappointed Amazon doesn't have content information like Dish Network offers or I would of never ordered it!

1011790,3,630533580X,"""TWILIGHT ZONE,THE MOVIE"" was one of those attempts in the 1980s to remake classic TV with every and all good intentions,but in the final analysis,it was a HUGE failure! never mind that the production of this movie resulted in the death of Vic Morrow and two children,and John Landis' legal battle over holding him accountable for the accident,but the movie itself,although a labor of love,just wasn't good enough! as a hater of remakes and reboots,trying to remake ""THE TWILIGHT ZONE"" without its principle player,the late,great,Rod Serling,was a futile effort at worst,but a noble gesture at best! using the elite corp of Hollywood's top directors like Steven Spielberg,Joe Dante,and John Landis,this movie was basically remaking
several classic TZ episodes,and i'm sorry,but that's just not done so easily! despite great performances by Kathleen Quinlan,Vic Morrow,and future ""3rd ROCK FROM THE SUN""s John Lithgow, one just needs to appreciate that this was 1980s filmmaking at its best,despite the fact that the film was based on a Television series that just cannot be remade,especially without Rod Serling and his superior writing! overall,its a good movie to watch if you understand the material it is based on,but this is ""Apples and Oranges""-if you've grown up watching the original CBS series and later catching it in reruns,you'll see and know just how good that the episodes this movie was based on really were! using Burgess Meredith to narrate
this 1983 movie was interesting,since he guest starred in at least four of the finest episodes of the original show (my two personal favorites were ""Time Enough At Last"" and ""The Obsolete Man"") otherwise ""TWILIGHT ZONE-THE MOVIE"" is seriously recommended to fans of both the original TV series,and fans of 80s-90s TV/movie remakes. amazingly,the failure of this Warner Bros. release didn't stop there,when CBS later brought back this series for its Fall 1985-86 TV season. although the effort to revive ""THE TWILIGHT ZONE"" was again a sincere one,it just couldn't hold a candle to the 1959-1964 series,not a chance! CBS continued the remake until around 1987,and in 1989,MGM/UA Television & CBS picked-up the syndication rights to the new series,and even shot new episodes in Canada-waste of time! and UPN,now The CW,brought it back in 2002 and was hosted by Forest Whittaker,,also waste of time! if you but ""TWILIGHT ZONE-THE MOVIE"",enjoy it as much as you can,but don't expect anything big or special! it's a watchable film,and enjoyable!",1483056000,,2498,5.2631578947368425

1011865,4,630533580X,The Twilight Zone movie is extremely uneven unfortunately. The wonderful prologue (with Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks) and epilogue ( with Dan Aykroyd) are fantastic. The 1st story is decent but is sadly remembered for the unfortunate death of Vic Morrow. The second story is terrible (which was shockingly directed by Steven Spielberg). The third story is when things get a lot better but the fourth story is a masterpiece and the main reason to watch the film. It's an extremely intense and creepy story that features John Lithgow in a terrific performance as always. If only the second story would have been great as well this would have been one of the best horror anthology films. As it stands it's a fun and entertaining but flawed movie. It's definitely worth seeing though and now that I'm writing this review I'm realizing that it's really only the second story that stalls an otherwise terrific anthology film.,1473984000,2,920,4.903846153846154

The Twilight Zone was skillfully written, acted, shot, edited and delivered. No foul words, just skillful acting and story telling at its finest.

""Twilight Zone The Movie"" is an INSULT to the REAL Twilight Zone series of Rod Serling. A dirty and foul attempt to capitalize on the works of Rod Serling and the many writers he employed.

1012045,4,630533580X,"the phenomenon of movies based on tv series has been with us longer than some might assume. some have even run adjacent to the series itself, highlights of which include 1966's Batman, 1979's The Muppet Movie, and 1968's Head, starring The Monkees. (that much in fact predates television: old-time radio characters often made the transition to the Screen. those were almost guaranteed to turn a profit, if only because they provided faces and mannerisms to go with those ethereal voices.)
the cinematic revival of a vintage series is another matter, but again a longer lasting one than you might think. it became something of a trend in the '90s, which many tend to insist and/or assume stemmed from 1991's The Addams Family or maybe 1987's Dragnet. by my calculations it's rooted in 1979's Star Trek: The Motion Picture. and i have to admit i'm only guessing about that!
1983's Twilight Zone: The Movie is one of the pleasanter examples. as helmed by four directors who had enjoyed the series growing up, with narration duties by Zone veteran Burgess Meredith, we are treated to an imperfect but heartfelt love letter to the legacy of Rod Serling. (to this day, after all, the series that resulted remains hands-down the greatest dramatic series in television history.)
first up is John ""Animal House"" Landis. he begins our journey with an amusing, if slightly drawn-out, prologue in which a motorist (Albert Brooks) and a hitchhiker (Dan Aykroyd) end up discussing favorite episodes. (apparently Amazon themselves wanted to get in their share of eerie implausibility: notice that their headline blurb cites only Aykroyd, as if he were a major player rather than a cameo.)
after getting us to and passed the title sequence, Landis uses a story entitled ""Time Out"" to focus a long-standing pet-peeve of Serling's, in and out of the Zone. Vic Morrow plays a frustrated loser who's bigot tendencies are kicked into high gear when the promotion he's been counting on goes to a Jew. at the height of his subsequent temper-tantrum he finds his perception momentarily transposed the business-end of the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. the film carries a ""written by"" credit that makes it sound like a Landis original, but it in fact borrows it's premise from an episode called ""A Quality Of Mercy."" (specifically, the one starring a barely recognizable Dean Stockwell (so young he still has a fairly high, non-scratchy voice!) as a gung-ho new lieutenant in Japanese territory during World War II.)
of course, this is also the most infamous angle of the movie. the death of Vic Morrow in a helicopter accident during the shoot left a stigma of sorts on the film, not unlike the one Carole Lombard's death bestowed upon 1942's To Be Or Not To Be. the film wasn't a big hit or even a ""sleeper,"" which is generally attributed to the gruesome manner in which Morrow was taken from us in the process, and the taint has only comparatively recently begun to dissipate.
some have further argued that the film is incomplete as a result, figuring that's the reason there's no redemption of Morrow's character. maybe, but it's just as likely that Landis never intended any such thing. i mean, not every villain has to be redeemed, does he?
but i digress...
it's an irony worthy of Serling himself that Steven Spielberg, easily the most acclaimed of the directors involved, should be the man behind the least satisfying segment of the film. he chooses to remake a so-so episode titled ""Kick The Can,"" about the inhabitants of a retirement home recovering the vigor of youth. it's not necessarily terrible, mind you, and Scatman Crothers has a nice juicy character to work with, but it can't help feeling like a lost opportunity. there were any number of better episodes which would be just as suited to Spielberg's talents. seriously, why'd he pick this over, say, ""The Hitchhiker"" or ""To Serve Man""?
next up, Joe ""Innerspace"" Dante serves up a nifty black-comedy version of ""It's A Good Life."" that's one of the most revered as well as creepiest episodes, featuring Bill(y) Mumy as an omnipotent child who rules his hometown with a the proverbial iron hand. (and of course, Mumy is but one of a handful of Zone veterans - William Schallert, Kevin McCarthy, Nancy Cartwright, Patricia Barry - enlisted back into the Zone for this segment.)
this version stars Kathleen Quinlan as a newcomer to town who takes pity on a seemingly friendless boy who appears to be bullied even by some of the grownups. in true thriller fashion, little does she suspect that the boy himself is in fact the culprit...and that she's essentially a new toy to him. and as it happens, the other inhabitants of his home are not his own family, but strangers similarly enlisted to fill in after their predecessors displeased little Anthony (Jeremy Licht).
interestingly, despite it's gleeful derangement, it's not quite so dark as the original. unlike Mumy's borderline sociopath, for instance, Licht's is dismayed to learn he's not making his prisoners happy. also, where the original ""little monster"" had the entire town under his thumb, his successor is content to own simply his own household. also, the episode ends with Anthony still in control. here Quinlan's character (who must know how to handle kids, as she came to work as a schoolteacher) opts to act as de-facto mentor (and/or mother). it's hard to say what original author Jerome Bixby might've made of this reimagining of his work, but Dante's new angle is certainly intriguing.
whereupon the aforementioned irony comes full circle: is it George ""Mad Max"" Miller, arguably the least famous of the four directors, who brings down the house with his triumphant revival of ""Nightmare At 20,000 Feet."" it doesn't exactly hurt that he's working with an adaptation by no less than original scribe Richard Matheson. (who, incidentally, also adapted ""It's A Good Life"" for Joe Dante.)
the white-knuckle airline passenger originated by William Shatner is now played by John Lithgow, one of the very few actors who could actually go the distance with Shatner in a showdown raw histrionics. what's more, the monster he sees on the wing is significantly less cuddly this time around.
(this enables one of the niftier moments of Lithgow's later sitcom 3rd Rock From The Sun. the ruler of the Solomons' homeworld, played by Shatner, arrives and mentions that there was some sort of monster on the ship's wing, to which Lithgow's character replies, ""hey, the same thing once happened to me!"")
so overall, it's an occasionally somewhat creaky but mostly quite enchanting re-excursion to that realm of the surreal that made Rod Serling a household name. like the two tv series revivals that followed it, just how necessary the film was is open for debate. but even so, no one who knows the series will ever call the film a desecration. it's a film by fans as well as for fans, and that alone lends it a merit of sorts.
and in any case, any film which showcases Creedence Clearwater Revival's kick-ass rendition of ""The Midnight Special"" can't be ALL bad.",1464307200,3,7053,4.902928870292887
1012046,5,630533580X,"This a great movie that contains four gorgeous tale directed by four different great directors that are John Landis, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante (GREMLINS), George Miller (MAD MAX).
You might want to say something like, oh Steven Spielberg, but actually Joe Dante and George Miller's eposodes were the best of the  best not only for me but whomever will see this movie will feel the same.
But above all, all the episodes are good enough to watch.

The music is done by Jerry Goldsmith and it's been never been better. He composed movies like <BASIC INSTINCT><TOTAL RECALL><GREMLINS 1-2><RAMBO 2008> and so many movies.

I don't want to ruin your imagination before watching this movie because I really want those who haven't watch this film yet to see this film so I will just mention a little about episode 3-4.
Episode 3 was directed by Joe Dante and is about a boy who has a supernatural power and because of this power he is always alone. I think even his parents abandoned him. So he gathers people and keeps them in this strange rather artistic looking house and force them to be his family.
One day he meets this beautiful woman and now it's time to make this lady his family again.

The house is really artistic like I said. Part of it is B/W just like the movie itself is B/W and some are really colorful like one of the animation like figure.
the people in the house are so interesting and lovely to watch although we know nothing about them or even we see them just a couple of minutes that's all.
From the beginning they act strange and that make us tension to go forward curious about what's gonna happen next.
Joe Dante is really good at that kind of stuff. Make the audience nervous.

George Miller is well know for his work MAD MAX and he recently has a big hit FURY ROAD. This last episode is a hit.
It is a charactor driven but also some special effect involved one.
John Lithgow was amazing in this segment and he was so fun to look at.

Above all, I can feel how hard the four of the director worked for this film and I fully enjoyed this film.

The part of the Steven Spiellberg's and John Landiss were also good but not comparable to other two.
Spielberg's one was to naieve as usual and John's was original but too short and kind of too dark to be remembered.
But as I said the four of them all are all enjoyable and if you had missed it by the time it was released, you should really check this out now.",1464307200,,2427,4.356194690265487

1012206,4,630533580X,"The Twilight Zone Movie is a classic horror anthology, featuring two original segments and two which remake iconic episodes of the original series. The first two are the weaker half of the collection, featuring a heavy-handed, ""racism-is-bad"" vignette that has little internal logic and Steven Spielberg's extraordinarily sappy tale of some elderly people rediscovering their youth, but the second two are stellar material and worth a watch.

The first segment is a bit of a chore to get through, honestly. An angry, racist jerk blames all his problems on Jews, African Americans, and Asians, and is then promptly transported to WWII Germany, a Klan-haunted American South, and Vietnam to have his perspective straightened out. While he's correctly identified as American in Germany, in the South he's inexplicably viewed as black. In Vietnam, the plight of Asians is depicted as the Viet Cong versus a band of drug-addled American soldiers who have shot their commanding officer, which seems like the most reductive view the filmmakers could possibly have taken on the matter. That a random white guy ranting in a bar is singled out for punishment while the atrocities the segment depicts were allowed to occur only adds to the logical void at the heart of this first story.

The second story, from contributor Steven Spielberg, is more enjoyable, but is mawkishly sentimental. A group of somewhat neglected old people in a retirement community are reminded of their youth by a newcomer, Scatman Cruthers (playing a textbook example of the ""magical negro""). He invites them out to play kick the can, where they transform into adorable children who mug for the camera and spout cornball dialogue, before realizing that they (mostly) don't mind being old and just need to put a little effort into their lives to be joyful again. It's not bad, but the sap is thick and unrelenting. A nice nod to the more whimsical episodes of The Twilight Zone, I suppose.

The third segment kicks things into high gear. Directed by Joe Dante of Gremlins fame, this is a retelling of the ""Wish You Into the Cornfield"" episode. If that doesn't mean much to you, I won't say anything else, as this one is more fun if you don't know too much. It does end rather differently than the original episode, however.

Finally, George Miller (director of Mad Max), remakes the ""There's a Man on the Wing of the Plane!"" episode. If you're wondering how they could improve on the original, I have two words for you: John Lithgow. This final segment starts at 11 and only goes up from there, and it's an absolute blast.

So this film is 50% Meh and 50% Great. None of the segments are that long, so the weaker stuff goes by quickly and the better stuff leaves you wanting more. Not the best film ever, but entirely worth your time.",1449014400,,2799,4.835073068893529

which contains episodes of suspense thriller storylines of bizarre happenings in peoples lives
these episodes could easily been shown with the TV series from 1959
there's 4 episodes each Directed by different Director
Steven Spielberg, John Landis, Joe Dante and George miller

the original dvd release by warners had no extras anyway except the Trailer
well this new blu-ray version is no Different
warner bros have given the blu-ray the exact same treatment, no new extras
it would've been great to get a new retrospect featurette with Steven spielberg, John Landis, Joe Dante & George miller
or maybe just Audio commentary with all 4 Directors talking about their segments
but obviously warner bros did not bother, did not make the effort very pathetic
WB have a very bad habit of reissuing old classics on blu-ray but getting no new special features
either cause WB were to lazy or could not be bothered to make the effort
which insults the fans, it insults me anyway
the only thing WB did make the effort with is a new HD transfer for the picture quality in 1:85:1 ratio
the picture quality does look clearer & sharper than the old dvd release
and a new 5.1 Master audio mix has been added which does boost the sound quality for sure

if you love the Twilight zone tv series and want to get this Movie version
buy the blu-ray version it's been given the same treatment as the old dvd release
but the picture quality is High Definition & does look much clearer & sharper big difference compared
 to the old Digital remastered dvd.

1012830,3,630533580X,"If one has not seen the original TV series, ship this and purchase those first. This an an 80's tribute of sorts which hits but mostly misses I think. The first episode (  ""Time Out "" ) was where Vic Morrow was killed in filming so it is seems cut & pasted together. Besides this story of a stereotypical ""bigot"" is preachy and condescending in a way the original never was. The original show addressed prejudices in a much more thought provoking manner.
""Kick the Can"" was the highlight of this movie for me, where an elderly man teaches others that age can simply  be a state of mind. This was a very touching remake of a 1962 episode and gets two thumbs up.
#3 is a remake of ""It's a Good Life"" and is quite silly compared to the original 1961 episode. I think they overdid the special effects and understated worked much better. ironically enough Nancy Cartwright is banish to cartoons and later becomes famous as Bart Simpson.
#4  ""Nightmare at 20,000 feet "", itself a remake of a 1963 Twilight Zone episode , worked most convincingly with John Lithgow as the neurotic passenger who sees a little too much.
I thought the  prologue was total waste of the talents and Dan Aykroyd & Albert Brooks and totally inconsistent with the Twilight Zone theme/nature. Of course Burgess Meredith's narration was a treat.",1397433600,,1312,4.594017094017094

1012832,3,630533580X,"I vaguely remember the accident that took the lives of Vic morrow and two Vietnamese children. I was only 12 when this movie was released. But now I've been reading up on the events that caused the tragedy f this film. I've learned who Vic morrow was. A very accomplished actor that had starred in a lot of movies and shows. Plus being the father of Jennifer Jason Leigh. He was a very good actor, and was very good in this movie.

But I have very little respect for John landis. This guy didn't comply with safety rules and regulations. He broke child labor laws. His arrogance cost morrow and the two children there lives. And to top it off  he's never taken responsibility for the accident. But it's ok, he's still living the Hollywood life. Making mega hit movies etc. and to top it off they never mentioned a rememberence in the memory of the fallen actors. I think it was one of the biggest tragedys in movie making history. Although I am a fan of landis's films. Not a fan of him after reading all that I've read about his actions before and after this accident. Watch the extras of the blues brothers DVD. Landis comes across as very arrogant. Probably his arrogance is what caused the deaths during this film.

As for the movie, it's average. My favorite segments are the bigot played by morrow and the lithgow segment aboard the plane. Dan ackroyd was good in this film too. The two other segments weren't that thrilling to me.",1397001600,3,1437,4.477099236641221

Vic Morrow and two children were tragically killed on the set of Landis's segment, so maybe extra features for everything but that segment might have seemed lopsided, but interviews with some of the actors (Scatman Crothers, John Lithgow, etc.) would have been nice.

1012835,3,630533580X,"I bought this video because I was always a big fan of Vic Morrow and I knew this was his last movie ..... I don't think I am biased when I say the first story, the one with Vic Morrow , was BY FAR the best of the four.  It certainly was the best written and acted and had the most acurate feel of the the old series ..... it has an extra kinda ""vibe"" as it was Vic Morrow's last movie and he was killed during its filming ...... It was actually a little hard to watch at times knowing that he would be dead within days of the stuff he was shooting.  From what I heard and know of him, he was a great guy and a kind soul. .... I give this episode 4 out of 4 stars

The classic episode with the gremlin on the wing,which originally stared Bill Shatner from Star Trek was played by John Lithgow , it too was fairly well shot, directed and acted..... but I have to say the original was still better ... yes of course the effects on the newer version were better but overall the original still holds up and I find it to be a show piece of the original series.  I would give this episode 2.5 stars out of 4  But watch the original first

The episode called ""Kick the Can"" was a re-tread of the original black and white version from the original series.  The story was changed around a little and I have to say it was changed for the worse.  The original story again surpasses the attempt to improve.  Overall it was ""Fair"" at best ..... I would rather have scene the original story .....  This was just a bad version of the original .... I would give this story 1 star out of 4 ..... which translates into ""ITS BAD""

The story regarding the demonic kid that everyone caters too.... its just a real ""DUNG HEAP"" ... its terrible and just plain stupid ... I got sick of trying to watch this episode and sped through the moronic stupid and poorly acted script.  The visual effects were also terrible and just plain stupid ........  I would have to give this episode ""0"" stars out of 4 which translates into ""DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, THIS THINGS IS UNWATCHABLE AND STUPID""

On a brighter note, Dan Ackroyd is a as great as always in this ...... So if you like Vic Morrow I would recommend picking this up just for the one story ..... I thought it was great ..... don't wast your time if your picking it up for the other 3 stories .... watch the two original black and white versions they are far superior to the ones you will find on this DVD .... the one so called original story about the demonic kid is soooOOoooOoooooo bad you will kick yourself if you actually watch the entire thing ...

1012962,3,630533580X,"""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" is at least worth watching once or twice, or revisiting it if you're old enough to have seen it when it was originally released in the 1980's. The movie features 4 segments from the original black and white TV series updated for the big screen.

The fourth segment, ""Nightmare At 20,000 Feet"" directed by George Miller (Mad Max), is by far the best out of the movie's four stories. John Lithgow puts in a great performance as a man terrified of flying who sees a monster on the plane's wing during a stormy night flight.

Steven Spielberg directed the 2nd segment about elderly people in a nursing home given a chance to become young again. It's full of Spielberg's trademark schmaltz, whether you like it or not.

The 3rd segment, directed by Joe Dante, involves a boy who can make anything he thinks of become real. He abuses the power by trapping a number of adults in a large house (one of them Nancy Cartright a few years before she became the voice of Bart Simpson). That story doesn't resolve itself very well. Although it does have a few freakishly good visual effects.

The first segment is by far the film's most controversial. It featured Vic Morrow, cast as a bigot thrown back in time to various war torn places to experience what it's like to be on the receiving end of hate. This part of the film's production was marked with tragedy when Morrow and 2 children were killed on set when a helicopter flying above lost control and crashed on top of them. Director John Landis and other crew members were charged with involuntary manslaughter but later acquitted. The deaths put a dark pall over the movie's release. Even with the use of some creative editing the 1st segment seems obviously unfinished.",1383523200,5,1741,4.642857142857143

The other 2 segments which included the part with Vic Morrow were the weaker links. This was a good attempt to repeat the magic of the original series, but it falls a little short.

1013269,3,630533580X,"Before I talk about this film, I wanted to mention something on a much darker note, and I'm sure everyone knows what I'm going to talk about. Vic Morrow was killed on the set for this film, along with two children, in a helicopter stunt gone horribly wrong. I love John Landis and I think it's a really good filmmaker, but his feet really need to be held to the fire on this one. I'm sure that Morrow's death saddened him greatly and I'm sure that it has haunted him since, I know that it killed his friendship with Spielberg, and I know that sometimes horrible things happen that you can't change and you can't help but live with regret over it and I understand that. I can't say that I know what that's like because I'm never been responsible for another person's death, so I apologize if what I'm about to say offends anyone. I believe that the way a director behaves on a set definitely has a huge outcome on what the final product is going to be. I don't believe in professionalism, but I do believe that if an artist wants his art to reflect his vision he needs to make absolutely sure that the people he is directing know that and then behave accordingly. If a director needs to become strict and push his actors into doing what needs to be done, that's fine. That's the movie set, and if actors and actresses don't want to do it then they shouldn't have signed up for the project in the first place. However, there must always be an element of safety to a movie set, no matter how intense the project may be. Sometimes directors endanger their actors and then things go well and it all ends up coming out effectively with little trauma. Sometimes actors do get hurt, and that adds to the final product, despite the time it may take after the fact to fix the relationship between actor and director. This, however, was one of those times in which a director took a terrible and large risk, it went completely wrong, it cost the lives of three innocent people who did nothing to deserve dying in such a terrible way, and it ended up becoming a sad cautionary tale in Hollywood. I'm not going to pretend to know all of the circumstances of the incident in question like everyone else does, but I do think that Landis must have had a serious lapse in judgement to decide to put Morrow's life in that kind of risk, and I can't say that I have a lot of sympathy for him. I have a lot of sympathy for Vic Morrow's daughter Jennifer Jason Leigh and I have a lot of sympathy for the parents of the children who died in the accident, but my sympathy for Landis certainly isn't high. This doesn't change my opinion of his as a person or even an artist. I think he's a good person and I even wouldn't mind meeting him one day, but there is little to no doubt in my mind about the terrible tragedy. I'm sure that the pyrotechnic operators, fire technicians, and stunt coordinators all made mistakes that caused the incident to go down so chaotically, but in my opinion John Landis was at fault for violating child labor laws and allowing such dangerous stunts and effects to happen in such close proximity in the first place. I hope that Vic Morrow, Myca Dinh Le, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen may forever rest in peace and I hope that John Landis and the rest of the cast and crew have been able to successfully move on as best as they could from this terrible tragedy. And now, onto the film.

Twilight Zone: The Movie is an anthology picture based on the famous horror/sci-fi television show we all know and love. The four shorts presented here are a mixed bag of material. Some of it works beautifully and is quite scary, and some of it fails pretty horrendously. In order to properly talk about this film, it's important to note that rating this film as a whole is trickier than usual because of the varying quality of some of the segments. I can't entirely recommend the film just because some of the material is pretty bad, but the stuff that does work works amazingly. I have the same problem with the film Four Rooms, starring my favorite actor Tim Roth. I recommend the film and I think people should see it, but be prepared to wade through some pretty crappy material before getting to the good stuff. The weakest parts of the film are the first two parts, and so I shall explore them accordingly and treat them as their own separate films.

After an effective opening intro involving comedy geniuses Dan Akroyd and Albert Brooks, in a breathtaking sequence that starts off very funny and then slowly turns horrifying, ala' Scream, The first story, Time Out, tells the pathetic tale of Bill Conner (Vic Morrow) a bitter racist bigot who gets drunk and upsets a group of black gentlemen at a nearby table and then leaves the pub. After he leaves, he goes on a horror odyssey in which he ends up assuming the roles of various people he is racist against before finally meeting his ultimate fate. The idea is clever, in my opinion, and has plenty of potential, but I found the end result to be far too heavy-handed and ultimately it is ineffective and kinda weak. Morrow turns in an effective final performance, but it's not enough to really give the story any real weight. The worst part about it is how predictable it is and how there is little to it, ultimately. The story ends in a predictable manner, the irony is too abundant for anyone to really follow or even believe, and above all we are left with little to no reason to even care whether or not he learns anything or gets his comeuppance. It could have been helped if the story had more interesting visuals, more surprises, more shocks, and less heavy-handedness. We are left with a message out of an after school special about the dangers of racism and prejudice, and we've seen it a million times before. I don't think that Landis could have directed the material any better, however. I think he probably should have just re-wrote the script and tried to find another approach. After such an effective opening scene, this segment just feels even more weak. I'd give it a 4 out of 10.

After that, however, we get a segment that makes Time Out look like a classic. Kick the Can, directed by Steven Spielberg, represents Spielberg at his absolute worst. I love Spielberg and I think he's a wonderful filmmaker and producer, but when people talk about him being sappy, cheap, manipulative, and corny, they're talking about this segment. It is the worst thing that he's ever made. Scatman Crothers is the lead in it, and I hope to god he got paid good money to show his face in this because this is just trite, inconsistent material that I can't even bring myself to write about. It's a huge step down from the original episode, I'll say that much. It lacks the energy and the understated beauty of it. A bunch of bitter elderly people are deteriorating at an old folk's home and some magic man shows up and makes the young again. Then they decide being young sucks so they get old again except one resident who stays being a child and escapes out a window while this mean old man wants to go with him. Then he plays kick the can. The end. The segment is so badly made that I used to fall asleep watching it when I was little out of boredom. I had never seen the second half of the film throughout much of my childhood because of this damn segment. It wasn't until I was about nine that I finally sat through the entire picture. I was unaware of all the crazy monsters ans stuff that appear at the end, and it's because of this damn story. I don't know what it is about this story, but it just doesn't resonate with me in any way. It's competently shot and Scatman Crothers does good work, as usual. I'm a child at heart too. I often purposefully seek out films about childhood because I feel like I can relate to them more personally than most other stories. I'm writing a coming-of-age novel as I type this. This story offered me nothing, and I got less than nothing out of it. I give it a 2 out of 10 because it is this story that makes me not want to really recommend the overall film. So yeah, 2 out of 10.

So then we take an enormous step up in quality from the disastrous second story to a third story that is quite spellbinding and surprising. Approaching, though not succeeding, Tobe Hooper in it's quality, Joe Dante's adaptation of It's a Good Life is quite enjoyable, though flawed. Dante opts to abandon suspense in favor of elaborate special effects. The approach actually work pretty well for the most part up until the very end when it looses steam and starts to grow tiresome. This kid with supernatural powers torments the adults around him in a strange halfway house, and an innocent woman is mixed up in the madness after accidentally hitting him with her car in a scene that is more hilarious than probably intended. What can I say? The effects are great, the characters are fun to watch and suitably off-kilter, and the visual style of the story itself is full of spectacle and flash. The story falls apart at the end and ultimately makes all the hijinks seem kind of pointless, but there are some disturbing and twisted ideas put forth here that will more than satisfy fans of the macabre and the morbid. The boy is believably creepy, but retains a sort of innocence throughout that actually makes the effects more chilling. The chaos comes from the mind of a child, and in some ways these ideas are more horrifying in their simplicity than the idea of a masked killer going around chopping people up. There's even a brief appearance from one of the most sadistic cartoons I've ever seen involving a little dog being tortured into joining some sort of shady group. It's not as good as the original episode. It doesn't even tap it. The original is one of the best episodes of Twilight Zone, and  in comparison to that this tale is weak. However, when taken on it's own terms it's actually pretty insane and effective in it's own weird way. I give this story a 6 out of 10 due to it's effectiveness, noting that it's not as suspenseful as the original and that it does eventually grow tiresome.

Then we come to the best part of the film, finally. Terror at 20,000 Feet, directed by George Miller, who directed two of the greatest films ever made (The Road Warrior and Lorenzo's Oil) and starring the scariest actor alive, John Lithgow. This story is scary as hell. It's atmospheric, it's dark, it's stomach-churning in it's intensity, and, above all, it tops the original. The story tells of a man who is deathly afraid of airplane flights who is already in panic mode as the tale begins. He sees a monster on the wing of the plane outside, causing damage to the exterior of the craft. Nobody will believe him, so he is forced to take matters into his own hands and confront his ultimate fear. The story is from his perspective, and the chaotic and dark atmosphere throughout the film already makes this segment something special in that we care and identify with this man. The original story starred William Shatner in one of his best performances. The images of the monster on the wing of the plane are engraved in pop culture as well as in the minds of many many children who grew up with the original show. It's one episode that will never be easy to top. Miller manages to do it gracefully, however, and watching it really did make me feel like I was Lithgow. These are the kinds of horror tales that take a lot of effort, style, and courage to really pull off, and Lithgow is never afraid of losing whatever dignity he even slightly had from the get go. He is one actor that I greatly admire, and this is one of his most enjoyable romps. The story is highly unpleasant and disturbing, but it also features the best effects work in the entire production. You won't be able to not feel sorry for this poor man, and by the time it ends you may likely be drenched in sweat. This story is effectively delivered and ends with a bang, allowing the film to be memorably creepy and haunting in the way the show was. Fans won't want to miss this one. I give this story an 8 out of 10, and combining all the ratings together results in the score located down below.",1354924800,4,12138,4.440807174887892

1013441,3,630533580X,"The movie tries to capture the masterpiece of Rod Sterling TV show of the same name.  The result is a bit of a mix bag.  There are 5 stories, but it's the opening and closing story that steals the show for me.  The main draw back is that there is very little narration between each act.  The genius of the TV show is that through Sterling's narration he was able to convince you to suspend you disbelief no matter how cheesy or hokey the stories got.

Each story recreates a classic episode and in each case I just keep saying I'd rather be watching the TV show with the exception of the final act.

The final act is Nightmare at 20,000 feet and you have a tremendous performance by John Lithgow.  The scene is shot great, the build up is outstanding, it scary, it surpasses the original show and it has a nice twist ending.

""It's A Good Life"" is surreal and bizarre, and has great twists and turns, the boy that played Anthony was great. ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" is a nightmare to watch for those scared of flying, intense weather, and monsters. The first two stories were also great, and you shouldn't skip any of them.

In the prologue, two guys are riding down a highway singing along with Creedance Clearwater Revival on a cassette when the tape breaks. So they try to amuse themselves in playing various games. Remember the line, ""Do you want to see something REALLY scary?""

In the first episode, a drunken bigot in a small town bar gets justice when he walks out of the bar after having insulted everyone into the Twilight Zone where he is chased by Nazis, Vietcong, American soldiers, the KKK, and back to the Nazis.

The second segment involves Scatman Cruthers persuading the residents of an old people's home to go out and play, and become young again.

In that movie, nothing surprised me, everything was evident and desperatly predictable, the stories are stories for very young children and told that way, the actors play is desperately flat and incredible. Nothing psychological at all, nothing from a strange dimension, nothing really frightened and obsessive as the Twilight have known to make.

For the DVD release of the movie that whole scene with the kids was CUT OUT, probably because they figured it would be more respectful.

The first longish tale tells of a vocal bigot who rails against all kinds of people; he is suddenly transported to the lands of these people as one of them. The second is about old men and women in an old age home who learn to feel young by acting young. The third concerns a school teacher who picks up an innocent looking young boy and drives him to his home, is invited in, and discovers his strange relatives and that the boy has unusual powers.

1013702,4,630533580X,"Rod Serling's classic TV series finally reaches the big screen care of 1983's TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE! This omnibus film features updated versions of three famous episodes and one new entry as directed by genre greats John Landis, Joe Dante, George Miller, and Steven Spielberg. The first story follows a steaming racist who is transported back in time through Nazi Germany, to the days of the Ku Klux Klan, and then into the swamps of Vietnam, where he must live out the horrifying life experiences of the people he claims to hate. Up next, the residents of Sunnyvale rest home are in for a treat when a magical game of Kick the Can restores their youth for one last night of fun. A young woman falls under the spell of a young telepath who has trapped her in his twisted dream world along with the rest of his fearful family in the third entry. Finally, an unfortunate passenger with a fear of flying spots a hideous creature tinkering with the engines, but his attempts to alert the crew only get him detained as the plane begins to plummet! TWILIGHT ZONE boasts a star-studded cast, including appearances by Dan Akroyd, Albert Brooks, Vic Morrow, Scatman Crothers, Kevin McCarthy, Dick Miller, John Lithgow, and many others. The film gets off to a mediocre start with Landis' ironic morality tale that more closely resembles the EC comic stylings from the 1950's, and then moves on to Spielberg's more sentimental approach to the series. These first two entries are only mildly entertaining, but Joe Dante and George Miller prove to be the big winners with the last two shorts. Miller's retelling of Nightmare at 20,000 Feet is a frantic and terrifying tale of paranoia and fear, itself, that offers up one of John Lithgow's most memorable performances. Overall, TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE is an enjoyable throwback to the original series with plenty of colorful stories and an even blend of light humor and horror.

1013705,2,630533580X,"When I was a teenager, I stumbled upon The Twilight Zone at some odd ""Classics"" hour and station.  It had me hooked: the psychological torment, the mental twists and horrors, the feeling that someone is crazy, you're just not sure who.  The shining hallmarks of the series were many: a good social message, creating monsters of the mind, and most importantly warning about the evils of humanity.  The Twilight Zone series created this terror by not using special effects, not resorting to cheap pop-out scares, not by making digital or plastic monsters, but by horrifying us with the monsters inside ourselves.

The movie ignored all of this in some ridiculous attempt to make a good thing better.  It was proud of new 80's technology with plastic masks and puppets, and overused them.  The tasmanian air devil, the shushing gremlin, the giant rabbit were all silly-looking up close.  The gremlin was great when it was just a shadow in the distance, it was ridiculous when you could stare at it for minutes on end.  It made the monster the focus of the horror, instead of the people.

Furthermore, the movie carried only a very faint glimmer of a social monster.  Ridiculously racist for no good reason?  You will get hurled back into ancestors of the people you denigrate.  Which is a nice bit of poetic justice, I suppose, except for the implication that good people went through all that torture at the hands of even more evil racists who got no such torment themselves.  Kick the Can, while overly saccharine, had the best social message (becoming young again when you are old would really suck, think about going through that stuff again), the message was lost with all the sappiness.

The evil child episode was the worst, with an ill-fitting beginning and ending, over-done special effects (the mouth was pretty cool, though), and the most clear bastardization of the original. Gone is the horror of a world where a child is all-powerful, instead we have a misunderstood child who simply wants to be told what to do.  The worst part, after the overdone effects, was the ridiculously long monologue by the sister who was already targeted for destruction; just driving home the fact that they didn't think the horror would stand on its own if they weren't bashing it over your heads.",1281657600,,2288,4.8158567774936065
1013706,4,630533580X,"In the tradition of one of the finest programs in television history, ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" takes us to another dimension; a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. Four great directors bring us four twisted tales of fantasy gone mad, with an amusing wraparound to bring it all full circle. Three of these tales we've heard before, but not quite like this, and the first is an all new experience of the unexplainable.

The first story in this anthology is brought to us by legendary director John Landis. Called ""Time Out"", it's the tale of a bitter, hateful man whose angry racism is reflected back on him through a most unusual series of experiences. This entirely original story does not play out as cleverly as it could, but even the hacked up ending, the sad result of a tragic on-set accident that took the lives of the star and two child actors, isn't as bad as people say.

The second story, ""Kick the Can"", comes to us from probably the most respected fantasy director of our day, Steven Spielberg. Ironically, I find it to be the least interesting in the film. It's the story of a magical visitor who travels to retirement homes to remind the residents of the joy they have lost with age, and how getting that feeling back is largely a matter of attitude and your state of mind. Scatman Crothers stars and is always a pleasure to watch, but in general, this piece just isn't as fascinating as what is to come.

Here's where things get really interesting, as ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" and Joe Dante bring us a remake of one of the best classic Twilight Zone episodes ever, ""It's a Good Life"". It's a story about a little boy with godlike powers, and of course, how such power in the self-indulgent hands of a child can be so very... ill used. This is one freaky segment, but very enjoyable and really quite different from the original. It's probably the main reason I wanted to own this film.

Finally, we have ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"", from George Miller, which revisits another of the best Twilight Zone episodes ever, this time with the great John Lithgow in the role William Shatner once played of a man on an airplane who is disturbed to spy ""something on the wing""!

""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" is wonderfully hosted throughout by classic TZ veteran Burgess Meredith, in voiceover form, and Dan Aykroyd is a delightfully familiar face in the films opening and closing segments, though here he carries quite a dark little secret. Though the first half is ugly at times and uninspired at others, not to mention plagued by memories of the helicopter accident that troubled every aspect of the film, the second half is a great ride and well worth it. And I, personally, love the wraparound bits too. If you're a fan of this 1983 film or the original show, you should definitely pick up this often very affordable Blu-Ray. Though it only features the theatrical trailer as a bonus, which is a real shame for a film with such a legacy behind it and so much history of its own, the movie alone is such a worthwhile trip!",1274918400,2,3058,4.583180987202925

1013708,3,630533580X,"I've been a huge fan of Twilight Zone for a long time now but never really got around to watch this film. I'm glad I did because while this film had moments, it was an overall disappointment. The start of the film was good but Aykroyd turning into a monster at the start of the film made me scratch my head.

The first film is surrounded in contraversy because the actor died on set. It started off pretty good with a man getting passed over for a promotion and he runs down races. He gets transported into different times that were hard for the races. The only part that I hated was the ending was beyond stupid and I hated it. For a PG movie, this one really pushes the censors with alot of racist terms.

The second film was a remake of the classic epsiode Kick The Can. I hated this film and it's probably Speilberg's worst effort.

The third film was awful. The first few minutes were nothing but references to different towns in original Twilight Zone epsiodes and even a directors name. The rest of the film just sucked and was unwatchable.

The final film featured John Lithgow in a remake of Nightmare at 5,000 feet. Lithgow did a great job as the lead actor and was by far the best story on the film.

Overall, started good but things got out of control. The final story was good but not enough for me to go out and recommend it to anyone.",1257206400,,1349,4.2745098039215685

If you like the film, though, you can't do much better than to get the Blu-ray version. It looks the best by far, as if the film was shot and printed recently. Clarity and detail look great, especially considering the age of the film.

The only extra included is the theatrical trailer, which isn't much. Tragedy haunts this film, so maybe the producers of the DVD and BD didn't want any extras included that would delve into that history.",1247961600,3,655,4.5423728813559325

1013849,4,630533580X,"Even though this is the film where the traggic accident with the late Vic Morrow occured - it still had the big screen flavor of the classic series.

Divided into four stories with a book-end open and close, Joe Danta, John Landis, George Miller and Steven Spielberg each direct their stories of magic, fun and the world only known best as Rod Serling's THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

My favorite story is called ""Kick The Can"" and stars the late Scatman Crothers as a man with a mission - a mission that makes all those who haved lived a full live realize how special their life really is. This one has a heart and sole and is touched with that Spielbergian Magic that only he can do.

Joe Danta directed ""It's A good Life"" which is a direct remake of the orginal series episode where a young boy controls his 'world' around him until he realizes through a stranger who mistakenly is visiting - that life is better when life happens on its own and is not whimmed up at the blink of an eye!

George Miller gets to direct another famous episode made popular by WIllaim Shatner origionally - now starring John Lithgow as the ""Terror At 20,000 Feet"" unravells it scarry tale aboard an airplane that may or may not have an extra passenger - but only Lithgow knows!

John Landis directed the late VIc Morrow final performance in a bizzar story of the Nazi's world and entering a surreal enviornment where everyone is treated exactly like you treat others. Evil, harsh and recist! Subtle but directly pointing at the dark side that is in each of us!

The book-ends are with Dan Akroyd and Albert Brooks - you have to see it to get the enourmous amount black comedy of the sequence. It will make you laugh - but you may jump a little! Boo!

Great production value - and although the DVD doesn't have any extra's - its still a good film at a good price. I liked watching it.....a lot! 3-27-09",1238112000,,1873,4.4273255813953485

A misbegotten film that has nothing to offer fans of the show, neophytes, or anyone else, The Twilight Zone movie is poorly made and only worth watching for TZ fans who have to see it so they can say they hate it for themselves.",1238025600,3,246,4.23404255319149
1013851,3,630533580X,"The film, true to many Twilight Zone episodes, starts with a seemingly common place setting. This prologue stars the always wonderful Dan Ackroyd and Albert Brooks and is accompanied by a soundtrack of ""Midnight Special"" as covered by CCR. Suffice it to say it concludes with the Twilight Zone's trademark twist ending. This clever beginning is followed by four segments with different casts and directors. They're all narrated by Burgess Meredith, who starred in some of the original television episodes.

The first segment is the only one that was originally written for the movie rather than being a reworking of one of the episodes from the 1960's series. Vic Morrow, who famously died in an on the set accident while filming this portion stars as a bigoted man who learns what life would be like if he was viewed differently by others. But does he learn his lesson too late? Probably because the real life tragedy that accompanied this part of the film necessitated it, this segment seems both too short and somewhat cobbled together.

KICK THE CAN has a wonderful performance from Scatman Crothers, but other than that it didn't do much for me. It feels too sentimental. You can tell it was made by Spielberg in one of his more sappy, family friendly phases.

ITS A GOOD LIFE is a surreal and darkly comic take on the original. In the beginning, those not familiar with the source material will believe Anthony is innocent, but is he...? This segment is marred by a happy ending which is quite different than the disturbing one in Rod Serling's TV series.

The final segment, NIGHTMARE AT 20,00 FEET is decent. You do see too much of the monster but what you see is frightening. John Lithgow is convincing as the paranoid main character.

So like many anthology movies this is a mixed bag. All in all the movie just doesn't quite come up to the perfection of the original show.",1238025600,,1883,4.728658536585366

1013855,3,630533580X,"TWILIGHT ZONE - THE MOVIE made headlines long before it opened when actor Vic Morrow and two Asian child actors were killed in a horrific accident during filming.

The scandal, the trial, and the resulting publicity cast a dark shadow on what is otherwise a harmlessly sentimental trip into the Twilight Zone.

The opening with Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks is pure John Landis, more of the same laugh/fright effect that worked so well in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.  But Landis' contribution to the tales, an original story not from the Zone canon, isn't up to Rod Serling standards.  The comeuppance of bigot Vic Morrow get repititious and--honestly--problematic when you consider that the US soldier is lumped with the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan.

Spielberg's choice is the lamest: cute elderly people get to become cute little kids for a night.  Any otherworldly wonder is lost under a heavy flow of Speilberg syrup.

Joe Dante has fun with his tale but his sappy ending--far different than the original TV version!--could've been directed by Spielberg.

This is THE TWILIGHT ZONE, people, not THE GOONIES.

Only the last time, my personal favorite of all Twilight Zone episodes (the original starred William Shatner, hilariously lampooned in the second ACE VENTURE movie), reaches the Zone.  John Lithgow is brilliant as a spazzing passenger in Richard Matheson's ""Nightmare at Thirty Thousand Feet.""  George Miller (THE ROAD WARRIOR) does an awesome job of putting you in the plane by filming the sequence with a handheld camera.

Lithgow's performance was so good that he SHOULD have been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards.  Well, he was.  But since THE TWILIGHT ZONE was tainted by the tragedy of Vic Morrow's death, Lithgow was nominated for his six minutes of standing around in TERMS OF ENDEARMENT (you forgot he was even in that, right?).  Such is Hollywood.

Think of all the Zone scripts that screamed for a big screen, big budget treatment.  ""To Serve Man""?  A condensed version of Burgess Meredith as the librian who survives the world-ending nuclear holocaust?  ""The Martians Have Landed on Maple Street""?  And Spielberg picks a story with adorable little tykes and codgers.

1013856,5,630533580X,"The movie that was long overdue. It doesn't make the original series look better or worse. And in some cases, an improvement. The gremlin in ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" was far better than the one depicted on the TV version and John Lithgow starts at paranoid and rakes it up. He doesn't start calm and build. Very difficult to do and I admire that.

""It's a Good Life"" has so many in-jokes it is not funny. Watch for star cameos, named of towns and references to the original show.

""Kick the Can"" is superbly filmed. Spielberg took his time and did this one with love.

I also suggest you buy ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD. You'll learn about the behind-the-scenes filming and that means far more than casual vieweing. It requires multiple viewings. The behind-the-scenes stuff is fun.

If a film can make you think differently about a situation then the writer director has accomplished a great job.  The first story about the racist having to suffer the lives of those who he discriminated make you think outside the box about racism.  The second is a light hearted tale where the elderly have a second chance at being young again, this segment is suitable for all ages.

What also affected this film was the appalling story about the boy in the house who controls all his visitors. The other segments are much better I am happy to say with the standout being the introduction with Albert Brookes and Dan Akroyd - this is pretty scary indeed. The story with Vic Morrow is also engaging and thought provoking, while the final story about a man scared of flying is both funny and scary.

I'm glad to see that it finally came out on DVD, but since we've waited so long for this DVD to come out, you would think this delay was caused because they wanted to put together some kind of documentary before releasing it.  But there are no special features whatsoever on this DVD.

I was hoping that we would, at least, get to see the Vic Morrow story since he died while filming this movie back in 1983.  Plus maybe a good documentary on Rod Serling and all that inspired the making of this film.  All us classic Twilight Zone fans would have expected that.  No mastering effort was put toward improving on the DVD either.  I've seen better mastered DVD's selling for less than ten dollars.

This segment is testament to Vic Morrow's final performance, one which he gave up his life for.  The least the DVD producer could have done is to show the movie in its entirety.  This would be the best tribute to a fine actor/director dedicated to his craft.  The stories for all segments does not intrigue but baffle the audience.  Production value also receives a minus.  Directors instead of actors take centre stage, the trailer and credits gave the directors more prominence than the actors or the storyline.  If not for Vic Morrow, I would not have bothered to watch this movie.

1014085,3,630533580X,"First of all, I'm a causal fan of The Twilight Zone only, but there are certain episodes that I love of that show. However, I had never really seen this whole movie before, only parts of certain segments. A friend of mine told me that it was pretty good, and I found it cheap, so I decided to buy it. To me, the overall film was pretty good, but not great. The film is divided up into 4 different stories, 3 of which are remakes of classic Twilight zone episodes, and 1 original story. Different directors did each segment, the directors being John Landis, Steven Spielberg (who also produced it), Joe Dante, and George Miller. With directors like these, one would expect something extraordinary, however, I really didn't feel like there was anything that special about any of the segments. Some were better than others, but still, nothing amazing. The first segment, done by Landis, happened to be favorite out of the 4, this one was also the original episode of the film. its about an outspoken bigot that finds himself traveling through time, occupying the bodies of victims of injustice: a Jewish victim of the Holocaust, a black man about to be lynched by the Ku Klux Klan, and a Vietnamese man about to be killed by U.S. soldiers. I really enjoyed this segment, and felt that it had a good meaning to it as well. The second segment, done by Spielberg, was the worst segment of the bunch in my opinion. I can't remember seeing the original episode of this one, but I really hope it wasn't as boring or as uninteresting as this was. The story is about an elderly black man that shows up at a rest home, and gives the gift of youth back to the old folks there. Highly sentimental and a overall nice story, I suppose, but very boring to watch! The third segment is the remake of the classic episode ""Its a Good Life"", which is one of my favorites of the old show. This remake, though done decently well, is not better than the original by any means, one glaring reason being that the original ending is changed to a happy one! For the most part, I hate happy endings in movies, especially when its NOT SUPPOSED to be a happy ending!!! (By the way, look for actress Nancy Cartwright in this one, better known for the voice of none other than Bart Simspon!!) The last segment is the remake of the great ""Terror at 20,000 feet"", originally starring William Shatner. This time, the staring role is John Lithgow. Now, I'm gonna a bit biased here. I'm a big fan of William Shatner, and in my opinion, no one is gonna do that role better than him in the original. However, I do think Lithgow had a good performance. The only thing that I didn't like was that I thought the character was way too over the top in the beginning, compared to the original. From the very first moments of the segment, Lithgow's character was totally freaked out and acted almost insane about flying! Where has in the original episode, Shatner's character simply was overly nervous, then got worse and worse as the story progressed.  However, probably the biggest dissapointment I had, didn't have anything to do with the movie at all. There are absolutely no special features on this DVD (I think the trailer is on there, but thats it!). With all the talent that was involved in this movie, as well as the tragic helicopter crash that happened on the set of the movie, you would expect a documentary, featurette, director's commentary, something...but no, nothing here. In closing, the movie has its moments, but there's nothing extremely good about it. And with the names involved, it definitely wasn't as good as one might think. Still, its worth owning, but with no special features to mention, only make it worth owning for a low price.",1193702400,2,3713,4.575075075075075

In the first story directed also directed by John Landis, a racist business man (Vic Morrow) who gets travled back in time to the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's where he becomes the three races he hates the most and becomes the one being hunted. The second story directed by Steven Spielburg is a gentle tale of a special magical old man (Scatman Crothers) that helps a group of senior citizens at a retirement home to make them young again, the third story is directed by Joe Dante (""Gremlins"", ""The Howling"", ""Pirahna"") about a traveling school teacher (Kathleen Quinlan) that accidently hits but doesn't injure a young boy as he gives him a ride home where he invites him to stay for a while with his strange family and discovers that the boy has magical powers that can alter reality and make wishes come true. And the final story directed by George Miller (""Mad Max"") is a terrying story of a nervous airflight passenger (John Lithgow) that sees a strange creature on the wing of the plane trying to destroy the airplane.

A splendid anthology of horror and fantasy stories from four directors and inspired by the classic TV series by Rod Sterling. The stories except the first one are based on classic episodes from the TV series while the first tale is a very original story, this movie got me hooked into watching the classic TV series and is a great anthology movie in it's own right. In fact, this was Vic Morrow's last movie cause he died during filming and the film is narrated by Burgess Merideth, this is a must have for fans of the series and anthology movies like ""Creepshow"", ""Grindhouse"", ""Heavy Metal"", ""Cat's Eye"", ""Dead of Night"" etc. This one of my personal favorites since i was a kid.

The notorious on set death of the great Vic Morrow cast a shadow over this films production and eventually its release.  The accident that caused his death and that of 2 extras is soul crushingly tragic to see and one can't help but wonder how it could have been avoided.  All that aside the film was decent in the theater at the time and is still just okay on its Blu-ray incarnation.  John Landis's episode is marred by its tragic history but Vic Morrow is good as the intolerant protagonist. Steven Spielberg's episode is a little too sweet and is really just an episode of AMAZING STORIES before its time, but hey Scatman Crothers.
 Joe Dante's remake is visually pleasing to look at and is the reason to pick this up, as it has some nice campy acting and is the least like its television counterpart.
George Miller's final episode offering is fairly standard with a good John Lithgow performance and a cool looking if not menacing beastie.  I like it for the nostalgia value but the best things about TZ THE MOVIE are Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd's intro piece and Burgess Meredith's spin on the narrator intro. The blu-ray transfer is average but the colors and set design of Joe Dante's section look great and the sound is nice and clean.

1014090,3,630533580X,"The Twilight Zone movie has always felt somewhat disappointing to me, and upon seeing it again on DVD now, it still feels the same way.  Featuring four segments (one original, the other three based on classic episodes of the series) directed by John Landis (An American Werewolf in London), Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante (The Howling, Gremlins), and George Miller (the Mad Max trilogy, the upcoming Justice League of America movie), the Twilight Zone movie starts out so well but ends up being ultimately disappointing for a number of reasons.  The Landis directed first segment features Vic Morrow as a bigot who gets a taste of his own medicine as he finds himself transported through time.  This segment is great, but feels unfinished largely due to the fact that Morrow was tragically killed in a helicopter accident.  Spielberg's segment stars the late, great Scatman Crothers as the mysterious Mr. Bloom, who gives the members of a retirement hi=ome a chance to feel young again.  There's nothing really to this segment, and Spielberg's direction just seems tired as well.  Joe Dante's tale is a mixed bag and is dependent on the viewer whether or not you'll like it or not, but the final tale is worth the price of admission alone.  George Miller's re-envisioning of the classic William Shatner-starring tale from the series features John Lithgow as a frightened airplane passenger who desperately tries to warn everyone of the creature on the wing.  This segment is spectacular, and Lithgow in particular gives one of the absolute best performances he's ever graced the screen with.  The prologue for the film is great too, and features Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks and is directed by Landis as well.  What's the most disappointing aspect of this DVD release is undoubtedly the fact that there are no extras whatsoever besides the film's theatrical trailer.  Just like they did with the 25th Anniversary Edition of Poltergeist, Warner Brothers has skimped out on the extras here.  Other than that though, the Twilight Zone movie isn't bad one bit, just don't expect anything great out of it.  It's still worth picking up though, and Miller's segment alone sets this apart from other horror anthology flicks.",1192924800,9,2214,5.016393442622951

A movie can be too violent, but I don't hear that being complained about too much. The minute a movie shows some type of emotion, Bammm! Everybody jumps on it. I could never figure that out. As for the technology, It's a Good Life was supposed to look cartoonish, so the creatures are cartoon like in appearance. The gremlin on the plane looked very cool and believable. For the people who say this technology isn't believable. Are CGI graphics in movies today believable? To me they aren't. They look like a video game or a cartoon to me when they are supposed to look like real creatures. It's terrible and ruins every movie for me, because while I watch the movie I'm thinking the effects look too fake, I'm not believing this. So I can't see why people are so down with the effects in the TZ movie. I think they were perfectly done and original. So for the people who are down with the effects in TZ, just kick back and relax and enjoy the flick. For those people it may look fake, but that was a time gone by.

I do appreciate the special effects in this film done today everything would be CGI and I think the CGI ruins the fun of on set effects. So maybe we are lucky it was made in the 80's. My one real disspointment more so than no EXTRAS!is the fact that WARNER BROS keeps on editing out the original WB logos that open their films from the 70's and 80's to replace them with the new logo while the new one looks sharp and clear unfortunatly it never fits the film it is showing so to speak.

1014222,3,630533580X,"I remember seeing this movie in a theater when it originally came out. I really liked it at that time, but I think it has not aged well. For all the gory detail on the movie, see the WIKI pages: [...]

On the intro, I liked the first scene with the car cutting through the dark landscape and CCR playing Midnight Special, but then the dialog between the two men in the car was too lengthy and sounded forced to me.

The first segment I thought was pretty good, especially for the message it sends (you could think of it as Karma on steroids). The main actor, cursing out loud in a bar on Jews, Blacks and Asian people, gets a load of ""karmic revenge"" when suddenly transferred to Nazi Germany as a Jew, as a Black hunted down by the Ku-Klux-Klan, and (presumably) as a Vietnamese during the Vietnam war. My wife made a comment that ""he will come back as a changed man"", and supposedly the original script had him save two Vietnamese children and indeed return a better human, but this episode was cut short by the tragic accident on the set. The resulting ending showing him deported in a train with other Jews does leave you craving for a more satisfying conclusion.

The second segment is probably the weakest. Spielberg's contribution is indeed overly sentimental, the acting a little overplayed and the story not really dramatic. The likeable old black man going from one retirement home to the next does succeed though in showing the elderly that they rightfully so can be proud of the lives they lived, but also not forget that they can still employ a joyful and childlike attitude and still enjoy their remaining years.

The third segment is based on a pretty cool idea, a young boy that can make everything reality that he imagines. The ""family"" he has assembled in his house acts pretty creepy at first, until you realize that they are just really fearful of all bad consequences that may happen when disagreeing with the little boy.

The fourth and final segment has mostly been found the most entertaining, I would agree. Seeing people smoke on airplanes obviously shows the age of the movie. The acting in this one is pretty realistic, and the story with a gremlin shoving airplane parts into a plane engine at 20,000 feet during a heavy thunderstorm is pretty cool.

It is a funny touch that they ended the final segment with bringing back Dan Aykroyd's character from the opening scene, offering to show ""something really scary"".",1192320000,3,2443,4.630484988452656
1014223,3,630533580X,"As a big Twilight Zone Series fan, a movie including remakes of the original episodes should be a must-have. Unfortunately, out of over 150 episodes, some of the weakest episodes were picked to be remade in this movie. The only ""classic"" episode is ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"", which originally starred William Shatner. The remake is well done, but the monster was actually MUCH creepier in the original episode.

The funny thing is that Albert Brooks mentions, probably the most popular, and definitely one of the best episodes (""Time Enough at Last"" starring Burgess Meredith) in the introduction scene of the movie. Why not remake this episode instead of just mentioning it? It was clearly classic enough to be acknowledged in the movie, so why remake mediocre episodes instead?

I'll never understand the planning of this movie, and I can never really enjoy watching it. If you're unfamiliar with the series, and need a gateway to see what it was all about, this is a terrible representation of what to expect. Don't waste your money here, buy the Twilight Zone Complete Season DVDs instead. There's plenty of bang for your buck there.",1192147200,2,1138,4.952879581151833

I happen to work at Magnolia Home Theater and we received (2) copies, so I snagged one before it hit the shelves. On to the movie. This is one of those movies you just want to have. It was my and many's favorite t.v. show and the movie is worthy of it's name.

DVD specs: VC1 codec, Dolby TruHD, DDPlus. Extras: Movie Trailer (poor picture quality)

Since the movie is literally 4 movies by four directors, you cannot review it as a whole as each have distinct differences due to the directors style.

The 1st Segment: Looks very good. The polyester suits and fat ties at the bar date the film. Good detail on the whole. Nazi suits are sharp, good color saturation throughout. Only glaring exception is in dark scenes some noise and not the darkest of black. The sound is very good, great front stage and the rears are used but won't distract what's happening up front. Good midbase and highs are really defined. I can't remember, even in the movies it having the detail in sound it has now, almost no LFE (sub-bass) but that's the way it was initially recorded. The TruHD is slightly better than the DD plus.
7 out of 10 in picture - 8 out of 10 in sound.

2nd Segment: Looks rather soft, but you have to realize again: Different director, different style. This one was directed by Steven Spielberg (good to see his stuff on HDDVD). You will notice the familiar softness that he adds to movies. The classic Speilberg soft filter (Goonies, ET, Close Encounters etc). Close ups of the older people look very sharp, long shots look a little better than a regular DVD, but in regular shots very detailed. The sound again is very, very clean. The score, which I remember as being very emotional and critical to the feel of the segment, was there and more. I still choked up at the end. Its good to see Scattman Crothers again (main charactor). He's a cinematic gem, delivering his usual steller performance. Remeber him in The Shining?
8 out of 10 picture - 8 out of 10 sound. Gave an eight because it's what Speilberg intended it to look like.

3rd Segment: Wow. This is easily the most impressive both sound and video. Colors are amazing! A few very small traces of grain, otherwise very impressive. When in Anthony's home, right away you notice the very colorful over the top couch, then the wall colors are made to stand out. I remember Quinlan being beautiful when I watched this as a kid, wow my memories serves me right. Detail is almost reference. The sound is equally impressive. Great dynamics, detail and out of the segments, the best bass responce. When the rabbit comes out of the hat.....look out it snapped me back.
9 out of 10 picture - 9 out of ten sound.

4th Segment: It went from wow to woe. This is easily the most dissapointing segment of the movie. It starts out very grainy, noisey, and dare I say VCRish. It then cleans up and looks good for a scene or two then for some reason, it goes back to VCRish picture. Very inconsistant and distracting. What was my second favorite segment, has been shown no love. It must have come from a poor master, or just hurried at the end, I don't know, but even the climactic end, was blurry and undefined. Sound was o.k. and that's a compliment. Lithgow is Lithgow so no matter how bad the print, he's an brilliant actor.
4 out of 10 picture - 4.5 out of ten sound.

The closing was worth the price of this disk. Rod Serling's voice and famous Twilight Zone score in TruHD.....PRICELESS.

In parting. This is one of those movies that you just remember every line, every scene, every facial expression. Having scene it in this form, I can say it still is by far the best this movie has been presented. The last segment being considered, I still recomend this film, not for a reference demo, but for what it is, a modern classic. Recommended to all who enjoyed the film in the first place.",1192147200,4,3920,4.457461645746164

All I'm saying is that it would have been nice to have some reminiscences from a few selected cast members and especially the directors...Spielberg, Landis, Joe Dante [""Gremilins""] and George Miller [""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior""]...each of who were a hot commodity and at the top of their game at the time the movie was made).

1014229,5,630533580X,"The music, the directing style, the special effects, the lighting...that's right, it's the 80's, 1983 specifically, that brings us Twilight Zone the Movie.

Yeah, as many have said, it was Spielberg's ""optimistic"" era of filmmaking, he had just finished making E.T. prior... and so as many people point out his episode ""Kick the Can"" is very childlike and easily the most optimistic, or ""sunny"", of the 4 segments (the style of this episode was to me a blueprint for a lot of what later would become ""Amazing Stories"")

In the meantime, the other stories are scarier...Of course the movie starts off with the famous John Landis segment (sadly, mostly remembered for the tragic accident) with the late Vic Morrow as the racist who suddenly learns what it is like to be on the other side of racism. It is directed in 80's Landis style and is not unlike his other films of that time as far as style goes, except for the serious tone of the subject. Landis mostly made comedies in the 80's ""Spies Like Us"", ""Into the Night"" etc,..which makes this episode interesting to see...

Then there is the third segment with the creepy kid who can make anything he thinks of happen...this segment has some real nightmarish interesting design going on (the house having a picture on the wall of a family with no faces, etc), like a slightly nightmarish cartoon, and Yep the future voice of Bart Simpson Nancy Cartright is the ticked off older ""sister""...the way the kid manipulates these adults into being his surrogate ""family"" is creepy and suspenseful, yet funny. The mechanical special effects of Athnony's ""cartoon-like monsters"" (created by effects expert Rob Bottin) for sure harken back to the 80's in the days before CGI. But to me, models and mechanical effects make the movies of the 80's what they were, and adds to the nostalgia factor in some ways...obviously the EFX, if the film was made now, would all be CGI ...anyways, Joe Dante who directed this segment would go on to make the much more successful Gremlins and so this is a sort of precursor to that idea

The final story is as everyone says the best....John Lithgow as the worst nervous flyer ever known (besides me, I hate flying)-This is one of the most memorable movie roles he ever did....  The gremlin on the wing of the plane is a trippy looking little creature...the directing, acting, & suspense in this sequence are the best of the 4 stories for sure-cool work from George Miller

I saw this movie in the Theaters back when I was a 13 year old kid. As a movie fan who grew up during the heyday of Spielberg and George Lucas, I guess I consider this movie a classic for it's 80's ""throwback"" style...but I think it's production stands the test of time pretty well....I am glad to see this film on DVD and I hope there will be at least a few special features",1187827200,3,2822,4.634

An imput of correction is fine, but to devote nearly an entire review into a continual rant against another person is infantile. It totally discredits that person. I know I'm on a bit of a soap box myself, but it had to be said.
  I will purchase this DVD and enjoy it for what it is, a minor homage to the epitome of sci fi television. Update: the film will be released in HD on Oct. 9th, 2007. Go to Hi Def Digest and see the stats. To bad Criterion cant seem to get aboard with their releases(especially Fiend... and Robinson...).",1185494400,3,1333,4.43265306122449

1014350,4,630533580X,"What is up with Warner Bros. on this one, still not out, like the reviewer below, I can only assume there are legal issues unresolved with this one, after all they & John Landis were sued over actor Vic Morrow's death in a stunt gone wrong for the first segment, E! True Hollywood Story did a piece on it, but that was in 1986 three years after the film's release, & the E! story was told back in 1999, so again, what is the delay? this one had four segments with four different directors with John Landis(Blues Brothers) doing the first one about a racist corporate guy (Morrow) who falls victim to all of history's treatment of those he hates, mainly Jews, African American, & Chinese people, he is forced to live in their shoes & experience his own hatred, this segment of course was cut short because of his death in a stunt gone wrong that would have had him renouncing his hatred & helping those he hates & ultimately redeming himself, this was never realized, but some scenes were shot, but not seen, & maybe Warner Bros. is in legal issues as to whether they should be released, who knows, however this segment is good, the second directed by Speilberg is o.k. but nothing to get excited about that involves elderly people getting a chance to be kids again & then realizing they don't want to be young again, the third is more or less a homage to Looney Tunes directed by Joe Dante(Gremlins) in which a young boy lures a woman(Kathleen Quinlan) to his house that is controlled by his very thoughts, this kid has a mean streak & apparently he is a unseen entity that constantly has Looney Tunes in the background & uses it as a way to terrorize her & others he has brought there as well, this one is out there, but Dante milks it for all its worth & has fun with it, the fourth one directed by George Miller(The Road Warrior) is by far the best one of the four that has John Lithgow as a fearful airline flight passenger who sees a gremlin on the wing of the plane he is on in severe thunderstorm & everyone thinks he is disillusional, Lithgow plays this character to the hilt, he once said it was his favorite role, & it shows, the storm makes it all the more unnerving, but it has its funny moments, especially the little girl who makes fun of him, & the gremlin himself is funny especially the window sequence, the main reason I want this one, it is a classic, & Dan Aykroyd chews up the scenery in the first & last moments of the whole film, definately a must have, any time now would be nice!!!!!",1182038400,,2508,4.3382978723404255

1014354,5,630533580X,"It is so great to see so many other fans of this movie.  I read the book ""Outrageous Conduct"" after I had seen the movie and I will never look at it the same way again!  Landis may have been breaking the rules with children working after hours and a helicopter on such a small set, but the fact remains that it was in fact an accident!  A tragic and regretable one, to be sure, but still an accident.

To Mr. Hardin:

Your review was very well written and you seem to be somewhat of an authority on the subject, but I don't agree with you that the first infamous segment with Vic Morrow was an original story made for the film.  I have always seen it as a revised, refreshed and modern version of ""A Quality of Mercy"", which features Leonard Nimoy in his first role.  That's what I think anyway.

And to the ""Disgraceful Zone"" kid reviewer:

If you don't even see the movie, you have absolutely no business giving a review.  Read the book ""Outrageous Conduct"", see the movie, then you may (or may not) have the brain power to critique such a great film.  Don't open your mouth unless you happen to know what it is that you're talking about!!!",1152057600,2,1142,4.289719626168225

1014485,3,630533580X,"the Twilight Zone movie was an attempt to recreate the magic of the original Rod Serling masterpiece series. However, I find it rare indeed to actually succeed in recreating an already perfect original. This film was made before the use of computer technology which shows its age, particularly in the remake of ""Its a Good Life"" where puppets are used which have no realism whatsoever. Also, the recreation of ""Nightmare at 20,000 feet"" was a good attempt at recreating a classic story, but just doesn't hold up to the imagination of the original.
I may be somewhat biased because I am a true fan of the original Twilight Zone, but this movie is part of the collection since it does attempt to give us a new take on the Twilight Zone stories and includes a new story not from the series as well. I believe this film also inspired the 1980s recreation of the series on TV. If you are a TZ fan, you will probably want to include it as part of your collection. If not, you probably will be disappointed in the stories as well as the outdated technology used in the film.",1039651200,3,1067,4.476923076923077
1014486,1,630533580X,"The 80's were marked by two prevailing philosophies: 1) Anything good can and should be improved and 2) If a little is good, a whole lot is better. Both of these ideas saturate The Twilight Zone movie and ultimately ruin it. First of all, three Twilight Zone stories are butchered and the immense talent of their stars wasted by the excesses of the directors. The ""Kick The Can"" segment suffers from syrupy emotionality and an absurd role for Scatman Cruthers.  In the original story an old man draws on his memories and his inspiration to evoke the plot's transformation.  In the movie, Cruthers appears as a sort of ""tin can fairy"" giving the ""gift"" of youth to old people everywhere (implying that the elderly cannot have inspirations themselves). The ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" episode features a way over the top performance by John Lithgow. He screams and emotes for what seems like an hour before the actual nightmare begins. By that time the audience is exhausted and the ""nightmare"" is trivialized!  It also ignores thirty years of airport security regulations. The segment that suffers the most is the ""It's a Good Life"" portion. Although it provides a creepy atmoshphere it ends on a ridiculously upbeat note.  While justice was a common element in the original series, in the movie the villian is never held accountable for his crimes, nor does he seem to rectify damge he caused to people, some happy ending. The segment written specifically or the movie breaks off without satisfactory resolution. Yes, I know the intended resolution was scrapped when two children died in the filming, but if the story doesn't conclude why include any of it? The wrap around material with Dan Akroyd was intended for laughs. In general attempts at humor on the show did not work well. At least they kept this element of the series, as the ""humorous"" segment comes out not funny but inane. In short, the movie has none of the orignal show's subtlety, heart or insight.",999475200,16,1965,4.839285714285714
1014487,4,630533580X,"Had it not been for an irresponsible gamble on the part of John Landis that killed actor Vic Morrow and two innocent Vietnamese kids, TWILIGHT ZONE--THE MOVIE would have been not merely a great omnibus movie version of Rod Serling's classic TV series, but perhaps even a masterpiece.
Still, this film manages to work.  Ironically, the Landis segment (with Morrow as a bigot who gets a taste of what he's dished out) and the Spielberg one that follows (an elderly magician [Scatman Crothers] gives new life to old folks) are the weak links in this film.  Joe Dante's segment, a reworking of the classic ""It's A GOOD Life"", is really a blackly comic sketch.  But the finale, George Miller's take on Richard Matheson's classic ""Nightmare At 20,000 Feet"", is the absolute best--suspense and horror combine seamlessly, with John Lithgow's performance as the terrified airline traveller possibly a warm-up of sorts for a similar role in ""2010"".
Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score and narration provided by Burgess Meredith (star of the classic episode ""Time Enough At Last""), subbing for Serling, who passed away in 1975, make up for this film's unfortunate flaws, which had nothing to do with the film itself but Landis' idiotic and fatal delusions of grandeur.",999216000,5,1255,5.053140096618358
1014488,4,630533580X,"This movie features four classic stories from the Twilight Zone recreated for the big screen. There are several cameos in each story and a big leading star in each tale. The first story is of a man tired of the racial diversity in the US, where he then finds himself leading the life of a Jewish man in Nazi Germany, a black man caught in the KKK tribe and another. The second is a good story of a retirement home that finds youth in its heart after becoming children again and finding that it is not worth staying young. The third is a twist on the original tale of a boy who's wishes come true as an unknowing women looking for adventure was lured in by the child. The final story is of the Gremlin on the wing of a plane as John Lithgow plays the sole man who sees the monster ripping up the plane. With this performance you can put John Lithgow in an empty room with a window and it would still be just as terrifying from the way he conveys what is out there.",996969600,45,963,4.127659574468085
