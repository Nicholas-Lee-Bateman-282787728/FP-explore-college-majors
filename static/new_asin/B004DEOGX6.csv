4332294,4,B004DEOGX6,"The video is cute in our window, but it seems Santa is disappearing from view for longer than necessary bits of time.  Also, the background is so dark and except for a candle there is nothing.",1385424000,,192,4.333333333333333
4332295,4,B004DEOGX6,"Very easy to set up and project.  Looks really neat.  I am not sure I would call it new...you get a burned DVD with the video on it.  Not what I was expecting when I saw ""New""",1384387200,3,175,3.675675675675676
4332296,5,B004DEOGX6,"What more can we say, grandchildren love it, we love it, people driving by loved it.
We played Christmas movies on it until Christmas Eve than Santa came out.
We had our owe drive in.
Just remember to flip movie or titles will be backwards.
Can not wait until Halloween to play horror movie to go with our other master mind decore!",1359072000,7,331,4.354838709677419
4332297,5,B004DEOGX6,"I had it up and working within minutes. My Grandson thought I had Santa upstairs. Very easy to install , just cut the material to fit the window and attach the DVD player.  The effect is wonderful. Thanks",1357603200,7,204,4.368421052631579
4332298,3,B004DEOGX6,"When I saw this item in a neighbor's window 2 years ago, I was enthralled.  This year, I ordered one.  It arrived in a timely manner.  The product was well-packed.
The mylar film was an odd size, & the only way I could get the image to fill the screen was to have it cross a window frame.  That was OK, I guess.  The odd thing was that I had to block the remainder of the window with a plastic bag.  That looked REALLY DORKY.
I eventually moved it to an upstairs window that was the same size as the downstairs window, so, during daylight hours, it looked really dorky.  The second story window had ""good news and bad news.""  The ""good news"" was that it was more easily seen from the street.  The ""bad news"" was that the second floor was substantially above eye level, so the display on the mylar was blurry compared to the straight-on (eye level) view.
I'm not a 15-year-old, so the hookup to the DVD player was not intuitive.  I could not get it to display at all on my portable DVD player, but had a fine picture connection with my full-sized DVD player.  I really was not able to reconcile the mediocre instructions on the portable unit and on the projector.
Now that the display is down for the season, I'll consult my IS guys at work to see if I can use the projector for presentations off my computer.  Otherwise, it will be an expensive package with very limited use.",1356739200,5,1375,4.286821705426356

4332305,5,B004DEOGX6,This was a great idea and well worth the money.  People would stop every night and checkout santa in our upstairs window.  The kids in our neighborhood loved it.  This was the showstopper for our xmas display. Next year I will add an FM transmitter so passers-by can tune in and listen to the sound track,1424822400,3,304,4.392857142857143

4332309,3,B004DEOGX6,"Video is about 6-7 minutes long, and was hoping it had choices to show.  Only one track showing Santa setting for xmas eve, pulling out gifts and moving around.  Would have been nice to just have santa checking his list and waving out the window.  Then I could have played it all xmas season.",1414454400,3,292,4.37037037037037

8425199,5,B004DEOGX6,"Purchased this DVD video after watching ""America's Great Light Show"".  Purchased a used corporate projection machine, connected my DVD player to projection machine, then I hung a $1.00 shower curtain over the window and 'Ta Da', Santa is waving out the window.  Apparently my house was the talk of the neighborhood as I stopped projecting the day after Christmas, but three different people came to my door and asked if I would turn on 'Santa' for their Grandchild, children and visiting guests. Video is of very good quality.  Santa is dressed in a very fancy suit.",1485388800,,566,4.875
