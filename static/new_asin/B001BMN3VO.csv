8283555,5,B001BMN3VO,"As a 60+ adult this video is vital as an educational and dialogue tool for older adults--all ages, too! We have grandchildren who are looking for spirituality in many places, not including church. We need to understand why and how to communicate. The same is true for young adults I meet traveling in the U.S. and other countries. Most are hungry to talk if they sense you will listen without condemning or overloading them with advice. They want authentic conversation and ""The Searching Generation"" helps to build bridges across generations. I strongly recommend it!",1238198400,,568,5.053191489361702
8283556,5,B001BMN3VO,"To all my fellow youth workers out there- this is a must see!!! Very honest film, tells it how it is, no sugar coating. You can use it as a tool to explain to the older generation why the youth are acting the way they are, and why they are so put off by organized relegion- and what they can do about it. Must see for parents of teens/students who want their kids involved in churches and faith communities.",1237852800,,407,4.1645569620253164
8283557,4,B001BMN3VO,"So much important research is being released on the so-called '20-something' generation, and ""Searching Generation"" adds powerfully to the conversation. Millennials, NetGens, NextGens, call them what you like, it's absolutely vital for leaders (especially in the faith community) to understand what lies at the essence of young people. This documentary lets some of today's most recognizable and powerful voices join the conversation. From a practitioner like Brian McLaren or Erwin McManus, to young philosophers like James Langteaux, or academics like Dr. Wales or Dr. Mintle, this program weaves a tapestry you must see.",1237852800,,623,5.709677419354839
