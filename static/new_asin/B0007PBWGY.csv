2230237,5,B0007PBWGY,At last the DVD's arrived as I wanted them: both In French and in English! The only fault I find in this collection is that it doesn't follow the chronological order of the original comic books. Check in every episode: the caricature of Herg makes a brief appearance in each one!,1201478400,3,279,4.490196078431373
2230238,5,B0007PBWGY,"I lived in Belgium for years as a child, and like every other child saved my precious allowance francs to buy Tintin comics.  I received this set of CDs for my 58th birthday.  What a wonderful surprise.  I loved every minute of viewing.
My only negative is if you choose to listen to the English version.  In french, the voice sound exactly like I expected Tintin, Tournesol, Captain Haddock, et al. to sound; in English, the voices are definitely not to type.  But if you can go with the French, sit back and enjoy.",1197676800,5,516,4.446808510638298
2230239,5,B0007PBWGY,"I got both Tintin DVD sets for Christmas and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them! I think I've seen each DVD, both in English and in French (it comes with both) at least 3 or 4 times.

Anyone who knows anything about the history of Tintin knows that he evolves all the time. The books we buy today are not the books that were originally published, are not the original strips that were first published in the Belgian Catholic newspaper in which Tintin was born. Everytime Tintin was changed, he was refined- he became less naive, more politically aware, more worldly (as opposed to Belgian). Whether you think this is a good or bad thing is up to you.

While these DVDs are not identical to the comic strips, I appreciate them for a few reasons. First, they're good, clean entertainment. They bring Tintin to life in a wonderful way. Plus, they're a great way to practice my French. You can watch these in English or French with English or French subtitles.

When I visited Chenonceau, the chateau on which Moulinsart was modeled, they had a Tintin exhibit in one of the stables, and they were playing one of these cartoons, in French. It was great.

I highly recommend these for anyone who loves Tintin or who is trying to learn French in a creative manner",1170547200,28,1243,4.511111111111111
2230240,5,B0007PBWGY,"I ordered The Adventures of Tintin from Amazon, but I got Les Adventures De Tintin. Not to worry. These DVDs include an English language audio track. I suspect there is no set labelled in English, since this beautiful creation comes courtesy of Nelvana studios in Ontario, Canada. But this box set is an embarrassment of riches; American DVDs should be packaged so well! Within the box are five DVDs, each with their own slipcases, with two episodes per DVD.

As Tintin fans know who may have caught these shows in their brief run on TV, Nelvana has done everything right. Somehow the characters seem right out of Herge's popular comics, which have sold over 200 million copies worldwide. Nelvana wisely refrained from updating the stories, so the first episode, ""Destination Moon"" takes place before the lunar landings, retaining the period feel of Herge's comic. This blue box containing vols. 1-5 has a companion red box with vols. 6-10. With the two boxes side by side the DVD jackets spell out Tintin, with a picture of Herge's intrepid sleuth and his canine companion, Snowy. Hopefully these sets will come back into print in the US, along with other lesser-known French and Belgian comics like Spirou and Fantasio (the source of the Disney cartoon Marsupilami). For Tintin fans, both francais and anglais, c'est magnifique!

Episodes in this box set (Vols. 1-5) include: Destination Moon/ Explorers on the Moon, Land of the Black Gold/ Flight 714, The Black Island/ King Ottokar's Sceptre, The Seven Crystal Balls/ Prisoners of the Sun, and The Shooting Star/ The Broken Ear.

Episodes in the red box set (Vols. 6-10) include: The Crab with the Golden Claws/ Tintin in Tibet, The Blue Lotus/ The Calculus Affair, Cigars of the Pharaoh, The Secret of the Unicorn/ Red Rackham's Treasure, and The Castafiore Emerald/ Tintin and the Picaros.",1134691200,139,1845,4.983766233766234

8050164,5,B0007PBWGY,I purchased this series in 2010.  I also purchased volumes 5 to 10 at the same time.  I paid $100.00 for both volumes.  I'm so happy with the purchase.  I used to watch Tin Tin when I was a kid.  As they say there is a kid in all of us.,1374710400,,236,3.549019607843137
8050165,4,B0007PBWGY,"As a fan of the Tintin comic books, I enjoyed the DVDs immensely. My major complaint is that the episodes are not in the correct order on the two volumes. There are also parts of some episodes that are not true to the books.",1295481600,,224,4.113636363636363
8050166,5,B0007PBWGY,"Although they took a while to get (to the degree of doubt), we finally got the two collections. I thought that the box is going to be bigger and I was surprised to see that each collection was in a single DVD box. They are recorded on two sided DVDs and each disk had 4 episodes. They are all in good condition.. Our whole family loved them..",1293235200,,342,4.119402985074627
8050167,5,B0007PBWGY,"We lived in France from '03 to '05 and discovered Tin-Tin books and DVD's.  Slowly acquired EVERY Tin-Tin book for our two boys (now 9 and 13), and bought some European Tin-Tin DVD sets while there.  Upon our return to the states were HIGHLY disappointed to find them unavailable in the U.S.  Finally found them through Amazon and bought both halves of the Tin Tin DVD set for our boys for Christmas, who promptly had a Tin-Tin marathon.  Couldn't believe we finally found them.  Well worth the somewhat hefty price.  True Classics.  Wonderful Adventures.",1263772800,,555,4.840425531914893
8050168,5,B0007PBWGY,"THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN VOL. 1-5 DVD SET is a fun set that has two episodes each. They run about 40-45-minutes for each episode and if you like cartoon mysteries like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo-Where-Are-You-The-Complete-First-and-Second-Seasons/dp/B0001CNQVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby Doo, Where Are You! - The Complete First and Second Seasons</a>, then you'll love Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy.

Although the box and the individual DVD cases--five in all--are written in French, each one has a fold-out insert that has episode information both in English and French, and for both DVD sets (1 & 2).

The actual episodes give you the option to choose either English or French language, as well.

Anyway, the cartoons are fun and the English speaking voice of ""Tintin"" is right on the money as the actor sounds just like a young man, not too old and not too young, and sounds just like the character looks! This makes the character endearing.

Check it out if you'd like to see some fun cartoons with adventure, and nostalgic sensibilities that show a different style and time.",1257984000,3,1150,5.591954022988506
8050169,4,B0007PBWGY,"The animation is beautiful and it stays true to all the stories, but The Adventures of Tintin is lacking when it comes to excitement. The action sequences, however wild or daring they may be, largely fall flat. Even the opening sequence, which has Tintin jumping off a speeding train into the river below, fails to make any real impact on the viewer.

It is certainly worth buying if you are a Tintin fan, but don't make it your #1 priority.",1254960000,,441,4.5125
8050170,5,B0007PBWGY,...not much else to say. every tintin book comes to life in this fantastic adaptation!,1233446400,2,86,4.8
8050171,1,B0007PBWGY,"After reading many positive reviews on Amazon.com, I rented disc 1 of this selection. I preferred reading the illustrated story. It's more suspenseful. On the contrary, the movie is boring. Also, the animation is stiff.

I am glad I did not buy it.",1217808000,4,248,4.767441860465116
8050172,5,B0007PBWGY,"I don't know why Amazon didn't cross this over to Amazon.ca (the Candanian Amazon) but you can find set 1 there. (I did on 7-13-08)
They really are good.  Each show is about 45 minutes.  They are great little mysteries with a ""adventure"" edge.  Tintin goes everywhere (along with Snowy)  Put you in mind of Indiana Jones adventure or King Salamon Mines.",1216166400,,353,4.645161290322581
8050173,4,B0007PBWGY,"Excellent job with transferring the comics onto a cartoon. Yet, too much suspense and then omission of important details.",1206921600,2,121,5.421052631578948
