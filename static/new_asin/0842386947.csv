8235530,5,0842386947,"Karen Henley has a heart for God and children.  My children are ages 5 and 7 and they still like to watch her videos.  The DVD contains priceless music and action that children will love.  The tunes are pretty catchy, I sometimes find myself singing her songs.",1207526400,,260,4.48936170212766
8235531,5,0842386947,"We love the Karyn Henley shows!  She 'interacts' and engages preschoolers with her music and stories like none other I've seen.  Plus, she weaves Biblical truth into almost every song!  I've used some of her action songs when teaching 2 & 3's in children's ministry for years...they all love them.  My kids, now 2 & 4, have Five Little Ladybugs and I Feel Like a Giggle.  Both DVD's have 2 full-length (30 min) programs to view.  As an extra bonus, Karyn isn't annoying for us Moms & Dads (or at least not like some others!), though some tunes might stick in your head for awhile :).",1187827200,,583,4.452830188679245
8235532,5,0842386947,"I used to own all of the Karyn Henley videos.  A welcome break from the tired shows repeated ad nauseum on the children's channels.

 My kids absolutely loved Five Little Ladybugs as well as Noah's Zoo.  The videos are colorful, easy to sing along to, and encourage proper self expression and promote manners, morals, good self conduct and teach about nature and animals.  My kids enjoyed them from the age of 7 mos thru five years old.  Highly recommended.",1132963200,3,457,4.7215189873417724
