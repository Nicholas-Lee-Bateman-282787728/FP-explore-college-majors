1801480,5,B000077VQR,"Ciao! Manhattan is avant garde to say the least! Filmed over five years by filmmakers David Wiseman and John Palmer, Ciao! does its best to blur the lines between the ficitonal Susan (""portrayed"" by Edie Sedgwick) and the reality of Edie's real life. Shot in both color and black and white, the plot is hopelessly besotted in drugs and conspiracy. Try as they might, the filmmakers could not pull a story together that made any kind of sense. Nonetheless, the DVD is loaded with special features that make it a worthwhile investment. Included are interviews, a still gallery of rarely seen photos of Edie and lost outtake footage with great voiceover commentary from filmmaker David Wiseman. Another feature worth a try is the director's commentary. The stories accompanying the movie itself is eyeopening and educational, to say the least. This movie is a must have for anyone intrested in the 1960s/early 70s underground movie making experience.",1063584000,20,947,5.076923076923077
1801481,5,B000077VQR,"Before I got Ciao! Manhattan on DVD, I had seen it twice before, once on video (first time) and once at a cinema revival screening of it (second).  I was fascinated by the movie upon my first viewing, but managed to make it through the second showing just barely...my unconditional admiration for Edie Sedgwick being what got me through it.  I mean, it's a weird, wacky, and wonderful film--full of great images of 1960's glamour and a funny, bizarre plot set in the 70s--but I bought the DVD really just so that I could complete my Edie memorabilia collection.
Anyway, I sat down to watch it the other night and turned on the special features first.  They were fantastic!  The interviews with David Weisman and Betsey Johnson were incredible; both of these people communicate very well the spirit of the 1960's and what they were experiencing and trying to communicate during the making of the film, not just in terms of the actual production but the way life itself was for these ""youthquakers"" back then. Weisman also gives some great insight as to why, after all these years, people (and young people in particular) are still so fascinated with Edie and the Warhol crew.  And then there's the extra footage, which, despite having no soundtrack, is absolutely mesmerizing.  Shots of 1960's kids, New York, Woodstock (I think), and of course outtakes from the film...well, it was just a fantastic bonus.  Watching the features first really made me appreciate the film the most I ever had when I saw it the third time...this is a DVD not to be missed (well, admittedly, for a certain audience with an interest in the 1960s).",1043366400,36,1625,4.761565836298932

1801568,5,B000077VQR,"I'll preface this review by stating the obvious; this is a niche film that likely will not be appreciated by people who aren't into avante garde (ie weird) films or who are not Edie Sedgwick fans. To put it bluntly, Sedgwick is the main and likely only reason why this film is still sought after. That's not a knock against the filmmakers because I think they would be the first to admit this.

I typically try to include a brief synopsis of the film in my reviews. To be honest, there's no clear way to describe this film's plot. Ciao! was shot over a five year period and, as you might guess, older footage spliced together with new footage rarely blends seamlessly into one cohesive story (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plan-9-From-Outer-Space/dp/6305760403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plan 9 From Outer Space</a>). The older footage was shot in New York City in the late 1960s in black and white. While the older footage is beautifully shot, most of the story makes no sense. Something about drugs (shocking!), aliens and a sinister man named Mr. Verdecchio who is trying to spy on America's youth because he might be an alien or something. Really riveting and thought provoking stuff if you're shooting speed but if you're boring and sober like me, the story borders on absurd nonsense. Since the two stars of the film disappeared during the middle of filming (Paul America ended up in jail, Edie Sedgwick booked it back to California), the filmmakers tried to salvage the film by shooting loads of footage with Mr. Verdecchio. This just prolonged the inevitable and production finally(!) shut down. But was that the end? Of course not!

Fast forward to 1970. One of the film's directors David Weisman goes to California, finds Edie, gets a crew together and resumes filming. Weisman (and his co-director John Palmer) come up with the brilliant idea integrate the 1970 color footage with the wealth of black and white footage they shot in New York from 1967 to 1969. In order to accomplish this, the black and white footage is passed off as the faded memories of Susan Superstar (Sedgwick) which she regales to a ""saucer people""-obsessed young hippie who picks her up while she is hitchhiking topless (as you do). When the film first began, I presume Sedgwick's character was suppose to be a somewhat fictional version of herself - fabulous, rich and wild. By 1970, Sedgwick's life, look and location had changed drastically which was reflected in the film. Gone are the famous black leotards, sliver stripped pixie cut, and famous heavy makeup. The new Edie has brand new not-so-state-of-the-art breast implants and looks more like a burned out hippie who took one too many acid trips. That cool, chic image is replaced by typical hippie clothes, long brown hair and a sense that Sedgwick is trying too hard to adapt to a new culture she'll likely never fit in to.

The color footage is by far the most interesting because it shows Sedgwick ""acting"" and is some of the last footage of her before her death in November 1971. The ending is particularly haunting as the filmmakers incorporated Sedgwick's real death into the film (how I would love to see the original ending!) and included footage of her wedding that took place about four months before her death. The song that plays over the final scenes and closing credits, ""Justice"" by Kim Milford, makes the entire reality of Sedgwick and her demise that much more sad.

There has been endless debate about Sedgwick's state of mind and overall health in the film. Some believe that she was taken advantage of while at her arguably lowest point and basically exploited for profit. She appears an utter mess in the film and is, at best, incoherent and obviously under the influence of...something. In the film's commentary, the filmmakers deny that they exploited Sedgwick and repeatedly claim she wanted to exploit herself because she was, at heart, an exhibitionist who longed for a comeback. One of the filmmakers, David Weisman, really harps on this fact which may lead a more cynical person to think the man doth protest too much. While Sedgwick was an adult and obviously responsible for her actions, it's hard to look at the woman on the screen stumbling around and incoherently delivering her lines as a wholly responsible individual capable of making sound choices. The fact that she felt that Ciao! could be a comeback vehicle for her serves as a prime example of her tenuous grasp on reality because it's obvious that Ciao! is not a comeback vehicle. Even if she had lived, I can't imagine it would have boosted her career or led to additional acting jobs. While I don't think the filmmakers purposely set out to exploit or destroy Sedgwick, I think they knew her decision making skills were questionable at best and another dose of fame is the exact opposite of what she needed.

The special features of the film are what make it tolerable. When I first got this DVD years ago, I attempted to watch the film without the commentary and gave up. As stated above, the story is just too out there for anyone to comprehend without some sort of guidance. The commentary, provided by the filmmakers and the sole surviving main cast member, does shed a little more light on what we're suppose to be watching but even with an explanation, this film is just bananas. Also included are four interviews with people who are either connected with the film or Edie herself. These include designer Betsey Johnson, George Plimpton (who helped edit Jean Stein's biography of Edie), Ciao! filmmaker David Weisman and the aforementioned sole surviving cast member, Wesley Hayes. Also included is a nifty photo gallery and approximately fifteen minutes of ""lost"" silent footage from the film. Weisman and one of the producers of the DVD provide commentary for that. Admittedly, the footage is interesting mainly because it shows locations in New York City in the 1960s. While discussing the footage, Weisman admits that most of what was shot in the 60s was drug fueled drivel that even he doesn't fully understand.

Although I gave this DVD a five star rating, I didn't much care for the film itself. The story is monotonous and nonsensical and the acting, by nearly everyone in the film, is terrible. The only positive thing I can say about the film itself is it was well shot and has a fantastic soundtrack that has, unfortunately, never been released. The real draw of this film is obviously Edie Sedgwick and the crazy back story regarding the film's production. For better or for worse, this is her legacy. Due to the nature and overall weirdness of the film, I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. If you're an Edie fan you'll obviously enjoy it but beyond that, there's not much here besides drug paranoia and some decent shots of New York City circa 1968 and early 1970s California.",1363651200,2,6886,4.891267123287672
1801569,3,B000077VQR,"Bad plot, parts didn't seem to fit into the story.

1801570,5,B000077VQR,"If you're interested in Edie and that whole thing then you have to watch this really. As a film it is what it is,these guys were walking what they were talking,so make of it what you will. Were all just lucky its here to watch at all,i guess.",1349913600,,242,4.0625
1801581,2,B000077VQR,"Can't believe this film is rated as highly as it is, because it's a total mish-mash of unrelated scenes, some captured in the late 60s and others in the early 70s. The highlights of course are from the 60s. You see Edie, Viva, Baby Jane Holtzer (who hated Edie because she stole her thunder), Paul America and Brigid Berlin in one of her hilarious bathroom rants. They were filmed at an indoor pool (situated in Al Roon's health spa) in New York City, and all players prepared by wiring themselves to the max with injectable speed. The situation notoriously erupted into a drug fueled orgy. Other parts of the film are totally boring and don't tie together in any coherent way. I'll never forget when I first saw this movie in the early 1980s. This wasn't the Edie Sedgwick I had admired because she had slid so she's practically unrecognizable. I was crestfallen. Poor Edie's a total ""barbed out"" mess sucking on a pint of booze while sporting a ratty hair piece.  Obliviously naked half the time, she's chilling in the bottom of a California pool. Always an exhibitionist, Edie couldn't help but flaunt her new breast implants, and there they are in her very first scene.

Recommended for only the most die hard Sedgwick fans. Excepting the 60s footage, this film is downright awful. Take it from me, you'll be fast forwarding through stretches of non-Edie related boredom. Infinitely better representations of Edie Sedgwick would be her Warhol films, which aren't readily viewable. Beauty No. 2, Poor Little Rich Girl and to a lesser extent, Lupe, showcase the underground superstar in all her Swinging Sixties glory. Or, for a fuller background, reach for the highly recommended books: Edie: An American Girl by Jean Stein and George Plimpton (oral biography with full family history) or Edie: A Girl on Fire (partly oral biography and very pictorial).

For me, Edie will always be The Queen of Eyeliner. How very sad that it was all over by age 28.",1348358400,4,1953,4.789317507418398
1801582,2,B000077VQR,"Judging by the movie launching instead of a menu launching upon disk insertion, my Agita Productions version doesn't seem to have any of the extras included with the Plexifilm release (more expensive, go figure), which many of the reviews glow about.
I'm guessing Jean Margouleff is Bob Margouleff's Dad, and got his role in the film by virtue of his having financed a large part of it.  If you read the Wikipedia review of the film (as of 2/22/2012), you'd never know Jean was in the film, as ""Mr. Verdecchio"".  If you watch the film, conversely, you may find yourself asking, ""Hey is this guy - with the 'nails-on-a-chalkboard' annoying voice - the star of the film, or is Edie?""  I found myself (determined to get to the end of the film) hoping the film would end soon because of his role.  Jean contrives to be ""de man"", running things, and keeping audio/video surveillance on just about everything.  In the 21st Century, we have pinhole cameras - virtually undetectable.  But Verdecchio doesn't need cameras or microphones for his monitoring.  He can even get a close-up of a patron at a diner with his magic set-up.  Dumb.  (Spoiler warming) He gets upset that one of his employees sets himself up with a double trick for the night, and they steal his employee's coke.  His solution for addressing the financial loss - have Charla (the go-between who set him up with the two girls) raped and pretend he had nothing to do with it.  Oh yeah, and ignore the two (Edie and the other girl...too many names to remember) who stole the coke.  Well, that is, ignore them aside from monitoring them, along with countless others.  Add to this the implication that Verdecchio is working with aliens, and you get implausible rubbish interspersed with the self-destructive bio-thingy of Edie.
Edie's character is presented as ""Susan Superstar""...why not ""Susan Contrived""?  She even talks about the suicide of her brother.  It was just weird hearing her called Susan in the film, as the film is best at its realistic moments, and often irritating in its attempts at dramatic license/intrigue/science fiction.
What do you do if the guy you hired to watch over your daughter skips town with the silverware instead of making sure your daughter makes her 8:00 shock therapy appointment?  You turn the garden hose on your daughter and her guest, and scream for the guest to get her to the doctor's.  Is this scene an attempt at comedy?
Wesley Hayes' character, Butch, seemed for the most part likeable, but once again the script took a lame turn when he was asked what he'd like to do most in life.  Turns out that's to `build a spaceship, meet aliens, and help 'em out and stuff.'  His character didn't seem that interested in trying to pick of the pieces of Edie, splitting shortly after dropping her off at the doctor's, but he's going to help a race capable of interstellar travel.  Uh-huh.
I think if you took just the moments of the film with Edie, and edited out most else, you'd have a more coherent, more enjoyable (albeit shorter) film.",1329868800,,3033,4.730038022813688

1801586,2,B000077VQR,"As noted by many reviewers, this film is a mess.  And generally, not in a good way.

The ""Mr. Verdecchio"" (Jean Margouleff) sequences nearly sabotage what little there is, but I guess when you finance something, you get to be in it....

By comparison, this film makes Ed Wood material look straightforward and prescient.  A review of the special features and interviews explains a lot.  Only George Plimpton--editor of Edie: An American Biography and Edie: American Girl--can string together a coherent sentence and maintain a linear thought.  Guess when you toss a lot of drugs on already marginal and self-absorbed personalities, Ciao! Manhattan is what you get.  Ciao! Manhattan is really very, very sad, both as chronicle of Edie and ""Susan.""  Some reviewers have noted the ""Silver 60's"" chronicled in the B/W sequences to be some sort of ""Paradise Lost.""  As if you're a ""Superstar"" because someone says you are, whether or not you've accomplished anything.  As if taking lots of drugs and acting recklessly is a statement of one's ""depth.""

Edie certainly is everything you've heard, one of the 60's great beauties: charisma  and vunerability coupled with mental instabilty-she's a ravishing nutcase (If you know her ghastly family history, it will only add to the tragedy). And sadly we're either seeing one of the 60's great under utilised acting talents or someone's obvious insanity caught on film-probably both.

Ciao Manhattan has that train wreck quality in gorgeous colour and B&W.

The commentary adds plenty of anecdotes and flavour to this disturbing piece of pop culture history.",1220486400,,686,4.991228070175438
1801588,4,B000077VQR,"It's sort of hard for me to write this review because I bought the film from amazon around 3.5 years ago and I must confess it was not what I expected, taking in consideration I was expecting a lot. The first part of the film definitely grabs your attention: it has parts in color (in the present) and black and white (in the past-when Edie was a superstar still); in these black and white images, as usual, we get to see Edie's incredible magnetism and presence, and there is a cohesive feel to the film. However, roughly before the middle of the movie, things start to get incredibly confusing and with subplots that, in my opinion, we just meant to add length and not real substance (the subplot related to ""Mr. Verdeccio"" in particular was the worst). I believe it would have been better to keep it short; for me, the final 30 minutes are excruciating to watch.

Moreover, the first time I read the book on Edie by Jean Stein I was in my late teens (now I am 31)and I idealized all this ""counterculture""; now I saw this film and it was pretty painful to watch at times...it almost seems cruel and coldhearted to have even asked Edie to finish this film because it is evident that her end is right around the corner. Once again in my humble opinion there was no need for so many topless scenes, it just makes the whole atmosphere gloomier, it seems like she did not even care anymore to at least get dressed (we know she was supposed to be acting, but still, what we would think is her real personality seems to be present at all times). Obviously so much of this is drug related, in the beginning she speaks so enthusiastically of speed, almost as if it were her lover; the return to the color scenes make the destruction the drugs caused much more apparent and dramatic.

I give this four stars because it is still a must see for any person interested in the seventies and contemporary history-culture, but you might consider buying it used instead of new (I guess it must not be readily available in any local rental). Everyone's opinion is different, of course, but chances are it will not get that much replay on your dvd.",1219968000,4,2130,4.445012787723785
1801589,5,B000077VQR,"I didn't know exactly what to expect when I purchased Ciao!. It was definitely filmed on her ""downhill"" slide, and that is very sad to see. Especially in the color footage, it is obvious that years of hard drug usage have taken their toll.

It also seems like she is topless throughout most of the color footage after the breast implants, which the filmmakers indicate was her idea/choice.

If you're a big fan, I would recommend Ciao!, however, I do not think it is a good introduction to Edie Sedgwick. I hope that someday soon they re-release all her early Warhol films; in my opinion I would rather own those.

There are some very insightful and funny parts, and despite the alleged inebriation of most of the crew/cast, it is very well-filmed.

The parts of the film with the Mr. Verdeccio character and his lackeys are just distracting and make little sense, but with Edie and Paul America disappearing for long periods of time during filming, the directors tried to do something to flesh the story out.

Lots of gratuitous topless scenes of ""Susan"" and her dialog is shockingly, blunt and sad as Edie appears fragmented and lost in most of the color footage. With her death arriving before production of the film was even finished, her intentionally dark and disoriented diction hints at the fact that she knew her end was near. There is curious footage of Edie's wedding to Michael Post tacked on at the end of Ciao! Manhattan, but then we see that inevitable headline ""Edie, Andy's Star of '65, Is Dead at 28.""

i first saw Ciao Manhattan, probably at that same revival movie house another reviewer mentions having seen it....and that must have been, what, early 90's? something like that.
it was a difficult watch.
i was tortured by the character of Butch. perhaps even worse is the young dude who plays Edie's servant, Geoffrey.
the whole sub-plot involving Verdeccio and co. is a colossal test of endurance and just about ruined it all for me.
and it was an endurance as well to sit and watch a truly disabled miss Sedgewick in the color scenes shot in 1971.
she's completely surrendered to a drug-induced state of .........zonksville.
but i still wanted her to make it through. to get herself together.
and i take it back..she's not COMPLETELY surrendered to zonksville because she speaks intelligently and thoughtfully about her past.
and her past is represented in this film by many black and white filmed flashbacks shot in 1967 when this project had a different agenda.
she looks great in these flashbacks. a bit trippy but still gorgeous and fun-loving.
even in the color scenes from '71 with her hair grown out and dark again as it was before she came to new york in the early '60's, she looks young and beautiful.
one of the blessings of this dvd is to learn via the commentary that Edie was very much part of this films objective and was eager to portray herself in an unflattering light.
so, i was quite relieved to learn that the wasted and disheveld Susan who she plays in the film is very much Edie acting in that way.
i recomment this dvd along with the book ""Edie Girl On Fire"" and the film ""Factory Girl""",1172016000,49,2205,4.744791666666667
1801605,5,B000077VQR,"Tragic"" is a word that may become synonymous with the name of Edie Sedgwick.

 The 5 stars are for Edie's smile, and nothing more.

 This ""Let's Start"", and then ""Stop"", ""Start again"" cycle of this film presents as a messy, disorganized glance at Ms. Sedgwick's disturbing life.

 Another 'tragedy "" exists here. Our educated culture should recognize that if Edie weren't exceptionally beautiful, there wouldn't have been much fuss over an ancestor of a historically noted family.

Beauty still takes precedence over most other attributes.
It's been over 35 years since the death of Edie Sedgwick, but the ""glam-famishished"" still won't let the beauty get her rest.

 The film's black and white scenes show the brilliance of Edie's past beauty, but are all cut and pasted into a confusing, tangled decoupage.

The additional color footage of the next decade is woven in carelessly.  If it was just Edie's glowing wedding sequence that were included, it would've been much easier to watch.

The ""two teenagers"" who appear in the the colored segments seem out of time with Edie's Glory Days of the 60's.

  This is NOT  a spiraling Masterpiece. Not a work of art nor imagination galore.

Just commercial trash for the star struck. For other than commercial purposes, it is a film that Spotlights it's own defeat.

It is a poor tribute to Edie Sedgwick and I prefer the very big, heavy photograph book.",1168387200,58,1399,4.905982905982906

1801607,5,B000077VQR,"The two Edie Sedgwicks in this shambling sprawl of a film tell me everything I need to know about what happens when you repeatedly apply hard drugs to a young mind. Not good.
Eyelash Edie of the Factory days in the mid 60s was a jangly amphetamine doll, and implant Edie of barely three years later, after she had been ousted from the silver clouds and sent packing back to SoCal...ouch. She looked like a bobble head version of herself.
I read Edie: An American Biography when it came out in hardcover in 1982 before I had seen Ciao, and the book devoted several pages on the production, so I kind of knew what to expect, but of course to see the players in action...sigh. The original movie teaser promised ""Speed. Madness. Flying Saucers."" That's about right.
Lasting images: Ms. Berlin injecting speed in the toilet stall, screaming and blowsy...Edie plumped out, vacant and trying to dance...Paul America in New York driving a car out of a scene and (knowing this from reading Edie) he just kept on driving to California, stoned out of his mind...
For me, maybe the the last scene in the film is the most moving, where the young man sees Edie's obit in the newspaper and flinches away in sadness and embarrassment--

1801608,3,B000077VQR,"This film is interesting only to anyone familiar with the saga of Edie Sedgwick.  And it seems a bit ghoulish/voyeuristic to admit watching it for that reason.  Although it's often claimed to be a biography of Edie, the film really is just a painful look at a person in the final stages of mental illness-drug addiction.  She died soon after filming completed, which is no surprise.

The plot of Ciao is pretty garbled by the storyline involving the character Mr. Vedecchio.  The director's commentary explains that Vedecchio was only added to the movie because during shooting the rest of the cast disappeared and  there was nothing else to do but beef-up this role.  In fact, the whole movie is a cut-and-paste of pre-meltdown Edie (black and white footage) and post-meltdown Edie (color), with Vedecchio and Paul America tossed into the mix.  The color section also introduces Butch, the drifter from Texas, who does provide some much-needed comedy.

Although Ciao, Manhattan might not be particularly entertaining on its own, the DVD extras in the Anniversary package are wonderful, and to me made the disc worth purchasing.  The directors' (and Butch!) commentary provides the story of how this movie ""directed itself"", and informs much about Edie and her state of mind during the last days of her life.  There is quite a bit of extra footage from the Warhol-NYC days, and some terrific stills of Edie.  A nice booklet is also included.",1109116800,17,1441,4.958333333333333
1801609,4,B000077VQR,"First things first, this movie makes NO sense whatsoever. If you can ignore that little tidbit, you can make it through this movie with no problem. Having a backstory to this movie (how it was made and why it seems to span years...it does!) will also help in understanding it. Basically Ms Sedgwick started filming this flick when she was on her 16th minute of her 15 minutes of fame. After disappearing from New York (where filming started) due to drug abuse, the filmmakers tried to salvage footage and shoot around their star in hopes of finishing the ""first aboveground underground film"". According to the filmakers (who do a wonderful job of commentary on this dvd), they found Edie about three years later in California still drugged out and fried from shock treatments. Going against conventional logic, they began filming again but, this time with a new cast (notably Roger Vadim) and a new storyline (using that word loosely). Not wanting to waste the black and white footage shot of Edie and other Warhol Superstars some years earlier, they intergrated black and white footage with color footage shot with rehabing Edie. The story isn't suppose to be ""The Edie Sedgwick Story"" but it's based on her life and her constant obession with pills, her modeling days and herself. One might wonder why any self respecting person would put all the disgusting elements of their lives out there for the world to consume and willingly act them out as if they had no idea it was their life. The plotline is besotted with conspiarcy theories of aliens, flying saucers and (of course) drugs. The whole point of this movie is suppose to be that a drifter played by some dude with the worst Southern accent since Viven Leigh in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", drifts into Susan's (Edie) life not knowing how much Edie's ""very public freakout in the 1960s"" has influenced his own devil may care attitude about life. Again, unless you know the backstory, none of this would be apparent. This film is basically Edie's slow death. The scenes that play out are erriely foretelling of Edie's tragic demise. Even though you know that Edie didn't stick around, you still hope that she'll clean up her act before the end of the movie. Sadly, she never does. She died during post production and the filmmakers tacked on an ending (I'm guessing she didn't die in the original ending) to tie up loose ends of a life that wasn't never tied in the first place. The finally flashback scene of Edie's actual wedding to a fellow rehab patient is shown followed by her real obit in the New York Post. A sad ending to a sad story.",1102291200,24,2600,4.703947368421052
1801610,2,B000077VQR,"I remember finding this film fascinating upon its first viewing by me, years ago in New York.  I was much younger then, and at that age, ones early demise always seems so glamorous. Now that I am older and wiser, I found this film, upon a recent re-viewing, only depressing and tragic. Though it is a supposed fictional tale about a former star of the ""in-crowd"", it is for all purposes a docu-bio of its star, Edie Sedgwick. Edie was , for 15 minutes, Andy Warhol's brightest star. He was enamored of her beauty, patrician family roots, and moneyed glamour, she of his very name, and his offer to turn her into an instant superstar. Their collaboration was brief, and she burned out. Though she grew up in the most privileged of families, there was a horrid hidden life of incest, suicides, and betrayals. Her drug use became one long suicide attempt, until the inevitible event finally occured in 1971. This film is an almost obscene documentation of her demise. Though presented in a fictional setting, it's not very hard to see where Edie's character of ""Susan"" ends, and the real identity of Edie herself begins. Indeed, the flashback scenes are actual clips of Edie herself, mostly in her Warhol years. But as the film progresses, we see the real Edie  has turned into a monster, she literally seems to be mutating,, and it is sad to observe. Though beautiful, death is painted on her face, and her hesitent and incoherent ramblings are too real. Ultimately, one is very aware of the feeling of exploitation of a very troubled, damaged human being. That she died not long after its filming will surprise no one.  This film, though not a Warhol production, is filmed in the grainy style of his notorious underground films, resplendently amateurish. Though hauntingly presented and scored, it is ultimately a tragic record of wasted life, and very depressing. The creative energy spent by certain parties since her death was an attempt to take a short-cut to the legendary status of a Marilyn Monroe, but this has not happened. Edie has become just a sad footnote to a bygone time, and her handfull of movies, most of which have never and will never be seen by the mainstream, they were not worth the price she paid, though she was arguably doomed long before their making. I would recommend this film only as a fascinating one time view for those who are interested in that crazy time and The Warhol crowd, but anyone other than that will only be bored, perplexed, or saddened  by this tale of poor, lost Edie.",1071532800,65,2515,4.696145124716553

7974137,3,B000077VQR,"I purchased the original movie, not the 30th anniversary addition with the additional footage and commentary.  It would probably have been preferable to purchase the latter given what I have viewed on You Tube. The ""Ciao Manhattan Tapes"" seem more interesting that the movie itself.

Or rather movies themselves.  What you have here is a haphazard splicing of two movies.  The first was a spring 1967 black and white film about New York City hipsters living life in a fast lane of flouted morals and broken taboos (drugs, sex, abortion, more drugs, more sex, and even more drugs).  There appears to have been be some kind of subplot involving UFOs.  Two of the main characters went AWOL - Paul America simply drove off in the middle of filming a scene and never returned, while Edie Sedgwick had a series of hospitalizations owing to her recurring mental illness and prodigious drug use.  Filming continued in black and white with the parts of some minor characters, especially Mr. Verdecchio, expanded.  Never more than half scripted, scenes only half shot, the project ground to a halt.  Jump forward to the end of 1970, and southern California.  A number of new scenes were shot, mostly in color, in an effort to finish the film.  Paul America was tracked down to a jail in the Midwest and filmed in his cell while Edie Sedgwick, determined to finish the film, pulled herself together just enough to be allowed out of ""the bin"" (as she called it) for a few weeks of filming.  The acting on the whole veers and totters between the dreadful and clich&eacute;d.  But there are good performances - Sedgwick, Paul America, and veteran Isabel Jewell (as the mother of ""Susan"") - and a few passable ones.  The soundtrack, which only became available in the spring of 2017, is a combination of Gino Piserchios moog synthesizer experiments (which sound like an early Atari video game) and slow-paced stoner numbers that both successfully evoke the times but seem unsuited to either of the stories the movie is trying to tell.

So what, exactly, is Ciao! Manhattan about?  The original (unfinished) 1967 story, while still present to some degree, transforms in two respects.

First, the film is increasingly about Edie (now ""Susan Superstar"") and her fall from ""Girl of the Year"" stardom to what might be called the beautiful wreckage of a human life departing this world almost right before our eyes.  Recounting her glory days as a model, underground cinema star, and Queen of Andy Warhols Factory in what appears to be a vodka induced haze Susan is poignant, tragic, pathetic, manipulative, and (self)exploited.  Numerous questions arise from her Sunset Boulevard-like performance.  Is it acting or a documentary?  Is she sane or insane?  Drunk or brain damaged?  Honest or deceitful?  There are no easy answers; she is all of the above, alternately and simultaneously.

Second, the UFO subplot is greatly expanded in the part of Butch, a naive Texas bumpkin who has driven to California from Houston and longs to build his own flying saucer, and a cabal of other characters who, from the shadows, appear to be members of some organization led by Verdecchio (who himself reports to something called ""the league"") keeping tabs on ""Susan"" and Butch and who may possibly have real contact with extraterrestrials.  Confused?  Don't worry about it.  The only reason the movie is remembered at all today is the involvement of Edie Sedgwick, and her scenes.  It isn't clear what the original ending was intended to be (Paul America escaping prison?) but Sedgwick gave the movie just the conclusion it needed  by dying of a drug overdose while the movie was in post-production.  A final scene was shot showing a newspaper headline announcing her death and shortly thereafter the credits roll.  Ciao! became a kind of epitaph of the 1960s.",1496534400,5,3826,4.920436817472699
