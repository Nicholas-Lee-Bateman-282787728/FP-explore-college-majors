8527927,5,B008H3OYY0,"The entire concert was a collection of Rita MacNeil's very best songs, all written by herself.  Every song was sung beautifully, and perfectly, and with great passion.  The atmosphere she created was surreal.  There is lots of additional footage of Rita signing autographs, and taking pictures with fans.  Also, scenes of the tourist attractions she visited with her band, and family, in Edenburgh, Scotland, and in England, where she performed at the famed Royal Prince Albert Hall.  She performances of ""Working Man,"" ""Steal Me Away,"" ""Everybody,"" ""The Crossing,"" and ""Home I'll Be"" were amazing, and showcased this gifted singer/songwriter when her voice was at it's very best.",1461196800,,680,5.317757009345795
