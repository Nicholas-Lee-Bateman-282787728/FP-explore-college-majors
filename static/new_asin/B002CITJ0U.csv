8364045,4,B002CITJ0U,"Music includes upbeating rock and metal music. Although I usually only like classical music, I found it appropriate for this exciting dvd (and the music is not loud which is good!).It has a lot of exciting scenes which even an adult would find fasinating. (load the salt, coal etc) I expecially like one of the scene (about 8 min) about the helicopter rehearsing a recuse.

However, 90% of the dvd is music and scene only and doesn't have any desciptions. And it is a bit pricey. Overall, if you don't mind the high price, I recommend it since it's interesting and it's hard to find something like this in the market.",1254355200,,617,4.558558558558558
