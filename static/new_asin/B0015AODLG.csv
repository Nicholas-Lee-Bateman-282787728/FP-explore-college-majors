So, if you understand french, being that this set is a french language only version (no english subs.) I would highly reccommend this box set.",1236816000,12,279,4.470588235294118

8257976,5,B0015AODLG,"Well of course, this is a GREAT trilogy of movies, loved them always since I saw them as a child in Cuba with... (here comes the punch line of my comment) SPANISH SUBTITLES!!
I can not believe for a minute, that after the digital era arrived, and these movies digitized and now even on Blue Ray, a real dream come true for a foreign movie buff like me and still: NO SUBTITLES and only FRENCH language....,
It had to be the french, they either assume very wrongly that all the rest of the world speaks french, or they think these movies (with Jean Marais and Louis de Funes) were not so good...
Hello french people!!!, there are people in the world that do not speak french and loved these movies...., at least ENGLISH subtitles would be appreciated...:(:(",1466035200,2,755,4.518248175182482

8257978,5,B0015AODLG,I was young when I  watched this three  excellent films of the unforgetable comedian Louis de Funes. I appreciate also the nice and fast shiiping.,1378598400,,146,4.8
8257979,5,B0015AODLG,"I bought this for my wife since she speaks French. Well you don't have to speak French to enjoy this. Fantomas are comedies and to say thier funny is an understatement. Fantomas is an anti-hero and super criminal mind who gets away with each crime he perpetrates, and does so with style. If you like foreign movies then the Fantomas series is one of the best!",1363910400,,359,4.454545454545454
8257980,1,B0015AODLG,The one star is for the pathetic transfer. Those are great movies that I have seen many times in Paris. This is the second set I am returning with the hope that I am going to get a set of DVDs that I can really watch without getting a headache from the fuzziness.,1341360000,4,263,3.981132075471698
8257981,5,B0015AODLG,"How do you want me to comment on the items I have not yet received. This is ridiculous. I know they are great movies. I watched them all as a child but now I want to share the joy and the laugh with my kids.
You are ware that I am still awaiting delivery. I am surprise that your delivery takes such a long time .If I knew I could have paid express shipping.
I am very nervous about this long waiting time.",1335312000,,406,3.9036144578313254
8257982,3,B0015AODLG,"The Fantomas trilogy is good entertainment provided you remember that the movies were made in the 60s. You have the beautiful presence of Mylne Demongeot and the funny Louis de Funs ( his character doesn't hold a candle to Sellers' Clouzot and he is a bit histrionic but it's okay). The only thing that seems odd was the casting of Jean Marais as the leading MAN. Rock Hudson
was a homosexual but he was able to portray real MALE
characters convincingly. Not so with Marais. The guy was a homosexual and he reeks of homosexuality in this movie, especially his voice timber and his gait. Perhaps they should have found a more manly actor.",1305417600,,637,4.5964912280701755
8257983,5,B0015AODLG,"This was a gift for my husband. It is completely in French. Very goofy humor, kinda like Jerry Lewis in French.",1297296000,4,111,4.333333333333333
8257984,5,B0015AODLG,Very funny 3 DVDs about the horrible thief Fantomas and  Detective Juve(Louis De Funes). If u love Louis de funes you will adore those movies.,1256860800,,142,4.68
8257985,5,B0015AODLG,"this classic french comedy remind me my infancy, i enjoy so much watch this movie then and now. is such a good comedy that keep you with your eyes open until the end. also i have to emphasise the cast with the great louis de funes,jean marais, the beautiful mylene demongeot and others greats french actors. this coffret 3 dvd include the 3 parts of fantomas, but is in totally french language, no subtitle in english.so this movie is more for people that like french or comprehend french language. enjoy the movie.",1253577600,9,515,4.608695652173913
