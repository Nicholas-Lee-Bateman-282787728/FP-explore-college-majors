2294440,3,B0009JE6DO,"The story of the Zapatistas I feel is one of great importance and I don't think the movie served the movement or past events as well as it could. Their are interviews with Noam Chomsky, Zach De La Rocha, and the leaders of the EZLN that are incredibly valuable. The film portion of the DVD failed to look further than just generalizations. It only looked at specifics of the movement momentarily and then moved on. It also spoke only briefly of the first incursion with the Mexican government in 1994: NAFTA is created, the EZLN is formed, they attack, and are chased into the jungle...in about 15 mins. The newcomer to the issue would be lost. I think the film would have been much better had they broken it into several parts. Starting with 1994 and then had 2 or 3 episodes to the saga. Good work but I could recommend better.

""A Place Called Chiapas"" I think does the movement more justice, with all due respect to ""Zapatista"".",1215648000,5,932,4.514792899408284
2294441,4,B0009JE6DO,Great interviews. Terrible music. Terrible cameras. Like something you would watch while standing in line at a skate shop or something but all in all interesting but if you are into learning more i would buy a place called chiapas much better!,1183420800,4,243,4.809523809523809
2294442,5,B0009JE6DO,"I could write a long review, but I won't. The day of the Zapatista uprising says it all. The day NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) came in to effect - some celebrated, these impoverished and brave indigenous people took up arms to make a point, force change, and make their voice heard.

What can you learn from men wearing black hoods to mask their identities, a fair bit.

People the world over have forgotten, there is no such thing as a free lunch. 'Free trade' is what I call - lipstick on a pig.

I recommend the following other DVDs: The Persuaders, Orwell Rolls in his Grave, Charcoal People, National Geographic Strange Days on Planet Earth, Life and Debt, a skeptical watching of Commanding Heights, and National Graphic's Taboo Season 1 and 2. The latter I recommend watching to realize that not everyone wants to live your lifestyle and people can have very different opinions on how to live. Then if you haven't, go travel abroad.

As for books - Native Wisdom for White Minds.

2294443,5,B0009JE6DO,"This is a very well made documentary about the zapatistas, the indeginous  movement in chiapas, mexico. Shows very well the impact of Globalization,  New World Order, New Economy, Neo-liberalism on the life of the poor of  this world.  Gives some history of their movement, but mainly an insight  into their problems and struggle and situation. Explains really well their  'ideology' and reasons.
A must see for everybody interested in their  movement or interested in seeing Globalization in action and it's  devastating effects on the poor of this world. Buy it, watch it, pass it  around.  (You can order it online from: [...] )  This one will not leave you untouched...

2294450,1,B0009JE6DO,"Chiapas is my favorite state in Mexico, but this movie does little to explain the situation there. If the people in Chiapas want to continue to pursue traditional lifestyles, that is their option, but taking up armed resistance to complain that they are not enjoying the benefits of globalization is criminal behavior which the Mexican government has an obligation to deter. The movie tries to show the Zapatista movement as a peaceful protest that was brutally shut down by the government, but a little research proves this claim to be invalid",1388966400,2,544,4.989010989010989
2294451,2,B0009JE6DO,"Along with Subcomandante Marcos there are lots of ultra hard left heroes here like America-hater Noam Chomsky and brutal cop-killer Wesley Cook (criminal alias ""Mumia""). Aside from those clowns there is some interesting footage of the Mexican army in classic stand-offs with indigenous peoples and interviews with various guerillas. You don't hear much about these folks any more. No doubt they are thrilled the oil companies are on their way back in to Mexico big time!

8061860,1,B0009JE6DO,"I don't care for the movement or these people. The big thing is these are a bunch of Communists dedicated to overthrowing the Mexican and U.S.A. governments. Why can't these idiots say....hey they are COMMIES.  There is an old saying ""Don't pee on my leg and declare that it is raining"". Another thing Noam Chomsky is a plastic talking head. I am fed up with this character. He is nothing. He was invented to carry the message for any malcontent. He just showed up one day from nowhere. I am not sure he is a real human. I sometimes believe he has a slot in his back where people put the quarters in. Now it is time for some burnt out campus commie to rant about how great this plastic slug is.
