8170247,5,6301302826,"Like me, I am having a hard time acquiring the Lemon Popsicle Movies. Each movie tends to have a different 'Main Title'. Like the the first Lemon Popsicle was titled 'Growing-up', the second one was titled 'Going Steady'  and one was 'Up your anchor'. ... These movies were being shown while I was in High School  and I remember I had to be contented with the censored version shown at my  country's movie houses.",961891200,3,413,4.554054054054054
