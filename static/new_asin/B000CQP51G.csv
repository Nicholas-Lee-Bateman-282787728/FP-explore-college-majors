8300610,2,B000CQP51G,"I faintly remember seeing Gene Littler play at the Amanna V.I.P, a long deceased Monday ProAm staged in Iowa city, Iowa;  just prior to the Canadian Open.  Gene had such a smooth nice tempo swing.  I bought this primarily to soak in / absorb on, Gene's graceful swing.  This barely shows any of Gene's swinging;  twice if i recall correctly

Gene is _-just-_ a front man for this semi instructional video,  which is, for the most part about a type of learning based on very slowly putting your body through  '-a-'  proper form of golf swing.  One size does not fit all, in golf swings.  We all ave our own idiosyncrasies/ pace/ body types and so forth.

Gene verbalizes a short intro, and a short exiting piece.  The rest is one or two people I'd never heard of, talking their instructional method while it is applied to a couple of every-day older male duffers.  I'm a senior citizen who's loosely followed golf for four decades and semi-literate about the predominate players that have been since Harry Vardon.  I've read stacks of Golf Digest, Golf Magazine and have a small library of books on golf.

The concept of  S-L-O-W-ly putting one's muscles through the range of what ever you wish to ingrain _is_ a good way to learn.  but one sentence covers that.  Don't waist your money on this.  Johnny Millers 3 disk is  money better spent IMO.

The video came very well packaged.  Was in the excellent shape it was described as being, and  had a short note from the ex-PGA pro who sent it.  It is what I ordered.",1437523200,,1514,4.518518518518518
