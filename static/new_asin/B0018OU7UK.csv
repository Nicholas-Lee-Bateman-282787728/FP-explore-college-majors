8270395,3,B0018OU7UK,"This is about Lin and Larry going to Africa and how they designed a pickup with a topper on it into a camper and traveled around Africa. At first I was a bit pissed that there wasn't any sailing on this video, to speak of. It is all about Africa and this little pickup they convert into a camper. Then I started thinking about it and what great ideas. You really could make a pickup with a topper into a traveling camper with a lot of features rather cheaply. So, good video, not much about sailing but it might get you thinking about transforming your pickup truck. Truthfully, I would rather have my money back or trade this for one of their sailing videos, which are great training videos. This is an outstanding training video as well, if you want to build a budget - bug out - camper.",1442016000,,789,4.302013422818792
8270396,4,B0018OU7UK,"The style and purpose of this video harkens back to the days of the ""Seraffyn"" books.  It is not a how to, rather, it follows the Pardeys on a journey through the African wild, and times spent on Taleisin in South America.  I enjoyed visualizing a small speck of what the cruising life can be.  This video is entertaining, howevere, not for someone looking for a ""how to"" video.",1338163200,,378,4.449275362318841
8270397,4,B0018OU7UK,"I have several of the Pardey videos as well as most of their books, but this is not my favorite - however, there is nothing wrong with the video per se.  As another reviewer mentioned this video seems more intent on exploring why to cruise, rather than how to.  I'm not sure the Pardeys are the best evangelists on that segment - and this video, although delightfully done, is as much about four-wheeling as anything.  The Pardeys have made a science out of turning the exciting, unsystematic and occasionally haphazard world of cruising into a careful, predicable and conservative venture.  Although it is clear that the Pardeys deeply love boats and have a weakness for touring remote and exotic places of the globe, their love of sailing, as an end it itself, doesn't come through when so much time is spent discussion houses and a safari.",1268870400,4,842,4.7465753424657535
