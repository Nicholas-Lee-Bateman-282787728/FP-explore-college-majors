I am not the type to plunk my infant in front of the t.v. but if I need a breake I can count on rollie. My son is only 5 months old now but I discovered that he liked the show when he was only 2 or 3 months old. I needed a chance to do some house work and I put disney on and placed him in his swing rollie came on and he was so ammused with it. I have never seen an Infant that young watch something so intently. I don't know if it is the bright colors or Zoie's voice. Back then he would usually fall asleep durring the show, but now he hears the song and all movement stops and he looks at the t.v. So for x-mas I asked that my family get these movies so if I need a break durring the day I can put one of them in. You might think that any movie would hold his attention at his age but you're wrong I have tried and rollie is the only one that really holds his attention.",1010966400,4,987,3.727272727272727
1103744,5,6305951756,"I don't know what it is about this show, but my 2 1/2 year old son can't get enough!  Even my 6 month old daughter is drawn to it!  My son got this video for Xmas and has asked to watch it everyday since. It is the only thing that keeps his attention right now.
I like it because it's a totally non-violent show and it does teach your child something, like manners and to be kind to others. All in all, it's a real cute show for kids!",1010707200,2,434,3.865168539325843
1103745,5,6305951756,For some crazy reason I like this show. I am an adult and its so cute that I watch it with my children. It has a quirky quality to it that makes it fun to watch. I laugh with them! Purchase this and you will become a fan of Rolie and his family!,1002758400,3,245,3.641509433962264
1103746,5,6305951756,"What a cute Christmas spoof with adorable short segments that are perfect for the attention span of pre-schoolers. Colorful story, appealing music, and charming robot characters appear in this magical and intriguing world. Fun, extended family interacts respectfully. Our kid viewers related to the young characters - whether they were just having fun, loving the snow, or sometimes having an accident. They commented: ""I loved the snow story."" ""I love to think about things in the future. Maybe we'll all have robot families in our families."" Great for 2 to 5-year-olds.",1000166400,4,571,5.285714285714286

1103748,3,6305951756,"Christmas takes on a post-modern twist in this video companion to television's popular Rolie Polie Olie animated series. I'll admit being charmed by the concept of ""Clanky Claus"" and the revised ""Twas the Night Before Christmas.""
But I can see how the complete secularization of this holiday might offend some parents. (Not kids... kids love this video!) Jingle Jangle Eve?",978307200,,373,5.233333333333333
1103749,2,6305951756,"It's only 24 minutes long, all the many commercials before hand are probably longer than the ""feature"" presentation.",975369600,2,116,5.5
1103750,5,6305951756,"This cartoon is one of the best to come along in a while. I STRONGLY suggest this to anyone who watches the show or has never seen it before. Clanky Claus is too cool and of course, Zowie steals the show. Buy it now!",975110400,2,216,3.9318181818181817
1103751,4,6305951756,"Rolie Polie Olie is one of the best shows. They are colorful, bright, high spirited and best of all the furnature is alive.  How could you go wrong with that? They teach good lessons also.",961200000,7,188,4.371428571428571
1103872,5,6305951756,"I bought this one as my granddaughter approaches losing her first tooth. As always this series is great for young children as I
have come to expect from Disney",1366070400,,159,4.517241379310345
1103873,5,6305951756,"What a video!  This Rolie Polie Olie is one of my favorites.  It's bright and colorful but also teaches kids a great message about people being different but the same.  We all need to teach our children about important issue such as people with handicaps, like Wheelie!  He has a wheel instead of legs but is just like everybody else! What a wonderful lesson for kids to know and practice.  I am so very impressed with Rolie Polie Olie.  It's a very new, retro way for children to learn and have fun!",1054684800,,500,4.380434782608695
1103874,5,6305951756,My son loves this video and has watched it many times. I found him pounding the tv screen yesterday.  I am not sure what he was so worked up about but he was smiling (and I had a chance to eat my lunch!),1030406400,,203,3.7209302325581395
1103875,5,6305951756,Bright and colorful computer animated tales of a young boy and his family and friends....and Pollie Pie!! She is so adorable....my son giggles when she comes on the screen!,1023840000,,172,4.9655172413793105
1103876,5,6305951756,"These just keep getting better and better! I like Round Pal Square Friend better, but this one is great too. In it, Rolie does not eat his brussel sprouts and tells his mom he did. He thinks about how a little lie can grow and grow out of control. It's a good lesson. In the next story Olie hides a note from his teacher thinking it is bad. He tries to be extra good. Then he gives the note to his parents and it was all good. He wishes he gave them the note earlier so he did not have to cover it up. They said whatever it was they would understand. A goos lesson about being open and honest to your parents. Finally the last story is about not wearing his helmet during skating. These videos are my 21-month-olds current favorites by far! Next is The Book of Pooh. Highly recommended for anyone under 3.",1023494400,2,805,4.166666666666667
1103877,5,6305951756,"This one seems extra special. Sure it is still only 24 minutes long, but the stories are fabulous! Rolie and Billie play round and square games and even change bodies. There is a new guy called Wheelie with one wheel. He is older and really cool. He takes Olie and Zowie to the park to play. What a park! Full of fun roller skating and swings. They have a blast with Wheelie! This video teaches that differences are good in others and to learn to walk in each others shoes to appreciate those differences. I like the message! And this video stands out with it's extra special animation and activities. A must have!",1023494400,4,614,4.442477876106195
1103878,5,6305951756,"This one is top notch! The children imagine what it would be like to be grown-ups and it is hillarious! The parents are the kids and demand vegetables for dinner and golf instead of cartoons. They want to go to bed early and their choice of bed time story is the newspaper. Rolie, Zowie and Billie want to stay up all night, but the newspaper puts them all to sleep. Very funny! The otehr 2 stories are equally as good with Uncle Gizmo and Rolie being just like Dad. I like this one the best, and I have them all. My 21-month-old seems to love them all equally. I am no longer annoyed that these videos are only 24 minutes long either. Well worth the [money] every time!",1022889600,5,670,4.2421875
1103879,5,6305951756,"My 21-month-old really likes this, and all, Rolie Polie Olie videos. I think this one is the worst. It really is all about a tooth on the loose. First Olie's tooth falls out, then Grampa's teeth jump all over the place and make a horrible high pitched squeal through the next 2 stories. Kind of annoying, but full of action for the toodler. I can't believe the computer generation in this series. It is amazing! Just as good as Toy Story and Rolie and Zowie are fun and cute.",1022889600,,475,4.348314606741573
1103880,5,6305951756,"This is a 32 minute Rolie Polie Olie tape! That's 8 minutes longer then all the other tapes. These stories are all top notch. The first one is about Christmas (Jingle Jangle Day) and the other three are not. The second story is about a really hot day where Dad makes an ice skating rink with one of his famous inventions. They all have lots of fun on the ice. The third story is about an ice cream planet that they visit and have tons of fun spinning in bowls, sliding on spoons and eating all the ice cream they can stand. The last story is about a falling lost baby star named Starry. They have to devise a way to get Starry back home to his mom and dad. A really cute tale! This is as good as Toddler entertainment gets! A must have. My 18-month-old girl thinks Rolie Polie Olie is better then Elmo and Barnet combined!",1014768000,3,822,4.176100628930818
1103881,5,6305951756,"This is a cute 24 minute show! There are three 8 minute stories. Two with an Easter chicken laying a good luck egg and chick, and one story of chasing and catching a rainbow that is really cute. The video is very colorful and entertaining to watch. The computer graphics in this one seemed to be inproved over last years tapes. My daughter really likes Rolie Polie Olie above Elmo and Barney these days! I only wish these tapes were of normal 55 minute length! Rolie will have a full length movie this summer to look forward to though.",1014768000,,535,4.414141414141414
