7813904,4,6301640527,"Josephine Baker (1906-1975) began her career as a dancer in various Broadway reviews, and by 1924 was known as vaudevilles highest paid chorus girlbut American racism placed strict limits on the stage and film careers of African-Americans.  What the American stage denied, the French stage delivered, and in 1925 she emerged as a mixture of garish energy and svelte sophistication on the Paris stage.  She was a member of the French Resistance during World War II and became a member of the Lgion d'honneur; she returned to America in the 1950s and 1960s and 1970s, appearing in various venues and working on behalf of the civil rights movement; and although her career (and finances) had significant ups and downs over the years, she remained a European favorite until her death at age sixty-eight.

In the 1920s and 1930s Baker appeared in several popular French films.  Released in 1934, ZOU ZOU is a somewhat standard melodrama.  Although she is black and he is white, Zou Zou (Baker) and Jean (Jean Gabin) have been raised as brother and sister.  In later years she falls in love with him, working as a laundry maid while he works as an electrician at a Paris theatrebut he is oblivious to her affection, continues to regard her as his sister, and falls in love with Zou Zous co-worker Claire (Yvette Lebon.)  When Jean is wrongfully arrested for murder, Zou Zou becomes the star of the theatre where he once worked, and pours her money into his legal defense.

Although the cast is quite goodGabin was a star in his own rightZOU ZOU is Bakers film.  She was not an actress in any trained sense; even so, she registers on film as a memorable performer and a great star.  Her presence is a mixture of wild emotion and complete innocence, her arms and legs seem to go on forever, she knows how to command your attention, and it is difficult to think of any other performer with a similar quality.  The film itself is somewhat uneven and at times very abrupt, so it is hardly in the realm of great classics, but Baker makes it worth watching, and it is interesting to note the films distinctly European edge in terms of mild nudity and sexual implications.

At times the film is badly spliced and the photography is streaked and riddled with artifacts.  Even so, these problems are not so great as to make the film unwatchable, and the DVD includes several short bonuses about Baker that add to its value.  Recommended as a window onto a great star who deserves to be remembered.

7813905,5,6301640527,"Madame Baker or La Baker, as the French referred to her, was a very dynamic woman who commanded attention with her presence.  It is hard to believe she, an American woman, is so convincing in the cast as she fits right in with the French, accent and all.  The movie has such an interesting plot and is a must see for La Baker enthusiasts!",1323648000,,338,4.265625
7813906,4,6301640527,"I am a huge fan of Jospehine Baker, and as I am reading many of the reviews written about her acting (not only on this website) I feel compelled to give my views on her performance as well. Josephine Baker is enchanting; there's no question why she was such a star in her day. Her light shines so brightly, even a full century after her birth. Josephine was so free: in her dancing, in her singing, in the way she lived her life. She danced as if nobody was watching her, and for the opportunity to actually have footage of her for my generation is amazing.

  Now on to her performance. When others review Josephine's transition from vaudeville to big screen, she is often criticized. It's obvious that Josephine Baker wasn't a trained actress. But what I love about her performance, particularly in this film, is that she was genuine. You get an essence of who Josephine Baker was, even 67 years after she is long gone and has appeared in ""Zou Zou"". She was smiling, singing, living, and loving. She never got the man in any of her films, even if she did escape racist America for a more liberated France. In a time where it was an insult for a black woman to be depicted as beautiful, Josephine stood proudly and shaked what her mama gave her - bananas and all!

  I love this film for that reason alone, for the opportunity to see Josephine live and in person in her prime. She had a lovely voice, and I didn't see how her acting was ""over the top"" as others say. In the scene at the end of the movie where she is walking down the street and begins running and crying after seeing her ""brother"" kiss her white lady friend, I could feel the despair that plagued Josephine's inner self; her pain of being a black woman during a time where she would who never get the man, no matter how beautiful she was. Her performance was genuine. I also appreciate the subtitles option for this DVD. I'm not fluent in French, but truly the words were all I needed mixed with her performance to follow what was going on. I recommend this to all true Josephine Baker fans, I feel it is the best depiction of Josephine Baker that we will get these days.",1316304000,2,2139,4.36180904522613
7813907,5,6301640527,This is a great video for fans of Baker or movies of the era.  It shows some of what made her such a success in the 1920s and 30s.  The DVD's quality is good considering the age of the origional.  The plot is simple.  The French film has English subtitles.,1299024000,,256,4.06
7813908,4,6301640527,"I am a big fan of Josephine baker.  Unfortunately this movie was recorded in French.  Those of you who do not speak french will have to rely on the written text to understand whats going on in this Movie.  Even though it was recorded in a foreign language, Josephine Baker managed to pull it off.  The movie, Zou Zou is still a hit!  I really enjoyed the singing.",1142467200,2,363,4.279411764705882
7813909,4,6301640527,"Zou Zou is the story of a girl and a boy who were raised as brother and sister. The sister Zou Zou falls in love with Jean and works contentedly as a laundress who delivers clothing to a theater where Jean works. The production is in trouble because of it's star, Barbara, who is incredibly temperamental. In the end, Zou Zou replaces her and becomes a star. The love story is a little strange, but the dialogue is witty and the story is realistic because Zou Zou has no expectations or ambitions of stardom throughout. The story is similar to 42nd Street just as Josephine Baker's later film Princess Tam Tam resembles The Pygmalion.

Baker has a clear voice that makes the songs enjoyable although her use of vibrato can be a little annoying if it is excessive. The songs are presented at the end of the film similar to the way they are often exhibited in American backstage musicals. However, unlike in American films, we see sections of the show that were shown being rehearsed earlier in the film. The show itself is strange; it consists of a series of vignettes of chorus girls surrounded by oversized objects such as beds and telephones. One oversized object is a birdcage with Baker inside, warbling a lament to Haiti. It is a sweet song accented by Baker's scanty, feathery bird costume. The next song that sings, ""There's only one man in Paris for me,"" is catchy and resembles songs that became standards in America.

The film features an artistic and emotional tracking shot at the end that stands out aesthetically.

Josephine Baker is extrordinarily vivacious and talented in this film. Her character is energetic and interesting.

The print of the film used for the DVD is scratched but not too noticeably. It is still watchable and often times, the story distracts the audience from the damaged print.

The extra features on the disk are nice to see because one might not expect them. However, the two videos concerning Josephine the woman are short. Josephine Baker: The Woman is a short documentary-like tribute featuring opinions of Lynn Whitfield, the woman who played Baker in the biopic, and her son Jean-Claude. The fact that the subtitles are optional is a great addition because those who know French would be distracted by the English words on the bottom of the screen. This feature makes the film accessible to a larger audience.",1122768000,8,2355,4.776412776412776
7813910,3,6301640527,"""Zou Zou"" is the French musical, ala Busby Berkeley, about the laundry girl(Josephine Baker) who falls in love(with her own brother), and naturally, by film's end, becomes an enormous theater star. A final scene has Baker drenched in the latest chic Paris fashion. Wounded by the loss of her one true love, it is but one of many touching sequences. The 1934 ""Zou Zou"" co-stars Jean Gabin. A generous Kino DVD, the transfer includes a documentary with Baker's adopted son, Jean-Claude Baker, several songs, and other extras. Kino released a video of ""Zou Zou"" in 2003. Choppy and crude, it sported lines, jumps, and breaks. Sadly, this 2005 DVD is from the same source print.",1120089600,7,674,4.869565217391305
7813911,3,6301640527,"A more extensive review of mine appears on the imdb.  This is
a poor film by any standards.  The sound is not very good and
the editing is very choppy and crude.  Acting is merely
acceptable and the Baker mystique does not translate well to
the screen in this-her first talkie (she had made one silent
in 1927, of which only three reels survive).  Kino's source
material is of a lower standard than their usual pristine
archive prints - there are lines, jumps and focus problems. It
may have been the only print available at the time.
This then is a mixed bag- interesting for historical purposes
and for those fans of Ms. Baker's vocal recordings. She only
made four films and only three talkies are available on video.
Other films in her imdb filmography consist of musical scenes
lifted from the four core films.",1055289600,19,815,4.6
