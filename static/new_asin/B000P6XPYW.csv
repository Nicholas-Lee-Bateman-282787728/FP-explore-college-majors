8189567,5,B000P6XPYW,"Strawberry Marshmallow is a 12-episode anime series based on a cute manga of the same name. It's as funny, warm and adorable as they come. No giant robots or magic battles in here. The show is meant as a dessert for the viewer and succeeds perfectly in that goal.

The anime is about four grade school girls--Chika, Miu, Matsuri and Ana--playing games, driving each other crazy and basically enjoying life. Witnessing the mayhem is Chika's big sister Nobue, a jaded but good-hearted junior college student, who is both annoyed and charmed by the kids.

The animation here is excellent; the girls are flawlessly cute, and the Japan they live in (we never find out what city) is pleasant and realistic. The voice acting is great and perfectly in sync with the spirit of the show...at least on the Japanese side. I'm not a big fan of the English dub. It wasn't terrible (e.g. Cardcaptors), but Strawberry Marshmallow is a very Japanese anime. Understanding the humor and themes requires some familiarity with the culture, so I guess no translation could really capture this show. (The English actresses sounded a little old for their parts, too.)

Overall, this is one of my favorite anime. It's the kind of show that can cheer you up after a bad day and make you long for your own childhood. Get it now while you still can, but I recommend getting the three volumes separately to save some cash.",1299456000,,1393,4.724279835390947
8189568,4,B000P6XPYW,"Very cute slice of life series, but very expensive . If you're interested in it you can buy the series individually for around $20 including shipping which is a lot better deal for such a short series.",1284595200,3,201,4.45945945945946
8189569,4,B000P6XPYW,"Strawberry Marshmallow, or Ichigo Mashimaro in Japanese, is a good series if you don't feel like violence, romance comedy or a deep plot. Some would call that boring, I call it refreshing. Its easy to understand, genuinely funny and is at the same time relaxed and entertaining. Its a good way to take a break from the more heavy-handed and complex anime.

The plot is simple: four kids and the teenage sister of one of them play and react to the most silly member of the group. Thats pretty much it and thats all it needs to be. Adventures beyond going to school after hours would just feel out of place in a show like this. And in case you're worried (or hoping) its a loli-heavy series, it is, but its not sexualized. Some anime does that, not this one. There are a couple scenes in a bath, but nothing is shown and the context is strictly comedy or because thats where a scene works.

Some people say the English voices aren't good, but I disagree. I think the cast's imperfect deliveries make them sound more authentic as children. They remind me of Charlie Brown specials in which real children were cast, but these actresses sound more proficient in performing than Peanuts casts. It was also nice to hear voices I haven't heard a hundred times before. I respect the major dub actors, but new talent should always be welcomed when they do well.

So why four stars and not five? Because this series, while good, is no FLCL. That doesn't mean its flawed, it just doesn't have all the goodness of a top-tier series. The soundtrack is definitely lacking when compared to one like Cowboy Bebop. But then, so is a lot of music. Its not a show that demands to be engaged in. Once you can identify a character by voice alone, you don't even have to be looking at it to get what you need from it. I listen to it while I play games and I don't really miss anything except shots of Miu lying on the floor. Its kind of like Lucky Star or Azumanga Daioh that way. All three are good but they can be background.

If there is a flaw, its the lack of character development. There is none. Everyone is the same from beginning to end. The closest it comes is Matsuri and Ana becoming friends, which seems to be in their natures anyway. No event is pivotal, not even Miu's temporary death. Thats often how slice of life works and I don't think it needs any, but if you're the kind of person who wants a story with a start, end and changes, you won't find them. Everything about this series is random, including the points at which you're dropped into these girls' lives and the point at which you leave them.

Should you buy it? If you read this review so far and nothing dissuaded you, I would say you should. Its a quality series and would make a good introductory anime for kids, especially girls, but is good enough that you won't hate sitting through it with them. I'm in my 20s and have no kids, but I like it. Its minimally violent (implied, off-camera hand-chops when one of the characters does something she shouldn't) has no language 'worse' than damn and the characters are simple yet three dimensional. Its clean comedy thats actually funny. Yes, it turns out that does exist.",1276473600,3,3176,4.440823327615781
8189570,5,B000P6XPYW,"The story is very cute. I like all the characters very much. The art is just as good as the art in the manga. The story is about five cute girls going to school and being cute. The English dub is not as good as the Japanese dub. So if you don't mind subtitles I would suggest using them. Overall, I would say if you like cuteness buy the series. ^.^",1257811200,,349,3.9295774647887325
8189571,5,B000P6XPYW,"I enjoyed it. There are other reviews that will tell you more.
 The set has 3 disks with 4 episodes each, English And Japanese language tracks and English subtitles.
Extras on disks include opening and closing animation, promo/trailers, a music video, and commercial spots.
This is mostly a fun, at times comic and to some degree insightfull slice of life story about Two sisters and the younger sisters freinds.",1250467200,,412,4.971014492753623
8189572,5,B000P6XPYW,"This super-cute anime is fantastic. Its one of my personal favourites and is described as a ""guilty pleasure"" by many anime fans world wide.

This boxset contains all 12 episodes from the series plus a bunch of extras (creditless opening, creditless ending, promotional video, music videos and TV CM spots). Its a fair price to pay, i had to pay and extra 11 (around $25 dollars) customs charge just to get it and i still think its worth the money.

The dub voices are fairly annoying when you first watch, but as far as dubs go it wasn't too bad (i have heard far worse). I was happy with the way the dub handled the parts of the show where characters are supposed to be seen speaking English. Unlike most shows they saw fit to put <speaking English> at the top of the screen and make the characters speak with a Japanese accent.

Its all good, providing you enjoy slice-of-life shows. I fully reccommend this to anyone and remind you that Miu wins.",1191196800,13,950,4.479768786127168
