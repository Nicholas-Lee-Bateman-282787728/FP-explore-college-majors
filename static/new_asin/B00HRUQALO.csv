8634937,4,B00HRUQALO,"Pretty good so-bad-it's good horror film.  Mexican-made, Spanish-language mish-mash about a group of people menaced by an evil scientist who wants an ancient treasure protected by an Aztec mummy.  He creates a clunky robot with a human head in a helmet.  He thinks this magnum opus will take care of the mummy.  Well, the mummy shakes off his dust, wakes in a bad mood, and flings the robot against the wall into a clattering heap.  Silly as all get out, but fun.  I bought the VCI DVD release and it is excellent quality.  Worth getting.  Recommended.",1405209600,,552,4.677083333333333
