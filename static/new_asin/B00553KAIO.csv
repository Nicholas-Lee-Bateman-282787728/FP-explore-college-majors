8457381,5,B00553KAIO,"I think I've seen every John Garfield movie now--don't know how this one eluded me for so long.  And in the year between Four Daughters and this film, he shot up from supporting actor to top billed---that's pretty good!  He really was a star the moment he entered the room in his debut, so it's no wonder they beefed up his part for this retread.  I liked it a lot---similar but different!  i like Claude Rains better without the whiskers, and i also thought the wonderful Donald Crisp was just right......he really did deserve Faye Bainter and the girls' affection over the upstart missing father. They're the only 2 players who were not in Four Daughters and they are both such seasoned actors, they really do add something substantial to Daughters Courageous.  In fact, if you saw that first, you might think Four Daughters was missing something.......",1454544000,,855,4.789115646258503

8457384,1,B00553KAIO,"I give the movie five stars, but the DVD copy is only worth one-star. It says that the movie is ""remastered,"" however it is of no better quality than the copy I recorded from TCM years ago. In fact some parts are of worse quality. Had I known, I would have never bought it.",1419897600,,273,4.074074074074074
8457385,4,B00553KAIO,"It was a better quality than I expected it to be, considering it is an obscure film to start with. Acting was superb by Rains which makes up for the simpering dialogue given to the supporting actresses. Donald Crisp's appearance was an unexpected surprise. Overall this film is worth having in your library.",1393200000,,307,4.811320754716981

8457387,4,B00553KAIO,"This is the first film I've ever seen with the famous Lane Sisters, and I must admit it was quite a delight.  As far as the sisters are concerned though, only one really took center stage and so it was hard to get a handle on why they were so special as a whole.  Priscilla Lane has a plum role here, as the more outspoken and key sister in the bunch, and so the other three (Lola, Gale and Rosemary) take a backseat to Priscilla and the other actors in the film.

Basically, `Daughters Courageous' tells the story of four grown daughters of a lovely woman who are have been abandoned twenty years before by their father, Jim.  Their mother has finally moved on in a more solidified way, as she has accepted the proposal of a quiet and sincere man named Sam.  While in the midst of celebrating, Jim shows up out of the blue expecting to be welcomed back into their world, but his daughters are especially reluctant to give him a chance.  As Jim spends time with each of his girls he starts to form an inkling of a bond and soon begins to encourage one of his daughter's relationships with a troublemaker much like himself.

The film has some really sincere scenes and it also manages to maintain the levels of slick comedic timing one would expect from a film of this nature.  The performances by the central actors are all wonderful.  Priscilla Lane and John Garfield make for a great screen couple and really complement each other well.  Fay Bainter is also wonderful, and her emotional scenes are truly touching, especially with Claude Rains.  Donald Crisp is one of my favorite supporting players of the 30's and 40's.  He just had an amazing screen presence, even in his soft and subtle roles.  Even here, where he does little more than stare at the camera, he conveys so much feeling.  But, for me, this film belongs to Claude Rains.  He just says so much and moves Jim through so many emotions that you believe every part of this man, from his cunning selfishness to his sincere desire to be more than that for his family that he abandoned.

It isn't perfect, but it has a lot going for it.  I haven't seen `Four Daughters', which I hear this is a semi-remake of, but I'm intrigued to see more from these Lane Sisters soon.",1340582400,8,2230,4.439803439803439
