8269249,1,B0018BDDG8,This was pathetic. First of all I was only able to watch the first half of the movie. The rest would not play on any of 4 different DVD players including my computer. What I did see was a poorly made movie. Did they really make movies like this back then? There would be long pauses between phrases where the actors would stare at each other or out into space. The acting was simply atrocious. It was a total waste of time and money.,1432857600,,433,4.166666666666667
8269250,3,B0018BDDG8,"Daddy Darling (filmed in Sweden by American Joe Sarno) is a film about a 19 year old - Katja (Helli Louise) who has a crush on her own father - Eric (Ole Wisborg). She becomes jealous when her father finds a new love of his life - Svea Karlson (Gio Petr).

In this coming-of-age film she experiences her first sexual awakenings with a friend of a friend, and then a lesbian art teacher and then ultimately her father's new love  Svea Karlson.

She never gets it on with her own father, hence an incest film with no incest. She fantasises about her dad when she makes love to her first lover - Lars (Sren Strmberg) but that's as close as this film 'dares' take us. I suppose that was enough controversy for 1970, but seems rather lame now.

The film's quality - it's print - is poor in places. There are scratches over the image. This is no digital re-mastering.",1377216000,,861,4.3625
8269251,1,B0018BDDG8,Movie wouldn't play all the way through without getting stuck.  Tried 3 different players.  What I was able to see was of terrible quality and I am surprised they bothered to save this film at all.,1369526400,,197,4.444444444444445
8269252,1,B0018BDDG8,"The quality fail,,,I knew it was going to be graining,,,and maybe there would be place that I would have to fast forward a bit.....It is an Old Original Video......But it was a bad copy...only worked for 10 maybe 15 minutes...Hmmm,,,I was disappointed but I knew I was taking my chances.....I have bought other Retro video with low quality which I was able to enjoy...This one failed...",1368748800,,386,4.863636363636363
8269253,2,B0018BDDG8,"Despite their best efforts, this was one of the worst DVD transfers I've ever seen. There are lines running throughout the entire film and it gets very bad in some spots. The audio also rises and falls in volume unexpectedly. And the DVD jammed up and would not play through to the end (it stopped around a minute and a half before the end).

As for the film/story itself...I found it to be boring as all get out, and anything but erotic. The acting was wooden. And the music was annoying. 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it seemed like an Eternity. If this is one of Sarno's best, I'd hate to see his worst.

(Oh...and the wigs were absolutely hideous -- 70's or no 70's. They were so ugly they were distracting.)",1362009600,4,709,4.323308270676692
8269254,2,B0018BDDG8,"typical story of a girl with a crush on her father and her jealousy toward the woman in his life.she wanted him to bed her but he being a good ,straight laced father ignored her advances and she started having sex with women,including her fathers girlfriend",1273795200,11,257,4.608695652173913
8269255,4,B0018BDDG8,"The creepy taboo of incest is explored/exploited by Joe Sarno (All The Sins Of Sodom) in this flick, but at least it`s the daughter lusting after Dad and not the other way around (I ain`t sayin` it`s right, but there IS a psychological condition known as 'The Electra Complex' that exists in certain young girls who have an unnatural preoccupation w/ their fathers). Katja lives alone w/ her father, and they share a deep affection - too deep, perhaps. One day Dad announces he`s re-marrying, and Katja`s world comes unglued. When she sees them in bed together, she decides to take matters into her own hands (no pun intended) and tries to disgrace her new mom while attempting to seduce her dad, who`s oblivious of his daughter`s fixation. This film is Danish-produced, and they were/are more lax in the apparant taboos we have ensconced in our American society, so the subject matter doesn`t seem so unusual or wrong (again, I ain`t sayin` it`s right, I`m just sayin`). And that`s why the movie works. For a film made in 1969, it`s notariety lies in its stretching the limits and possibilities of soft-core erotica, just before the advent of hardcore movies took us over the top. It helps that the actresses are attractive, the nudity abundant, and the exploitation envelope pushed. All in all, a good example of reasonably intelligent erotica from a lost era, well-handled (again,no pun intended) and well-executed. (Ignore the reviewer who whined about the picture quality, mine was fine). Loads of extras, trailers for other Joe Sarno flix, and a booklet - now, who`s your daddy?",1268179200,23,1584,4.914179104477612
8269256,1,B0018BDDG8,The DVD is terrible quality.  There are lines and flakes through the entire DVD.  Would not recommend this video at all.,1265932800,2,120,4.666666666666667

Instead he surprises her with the annoucement that he is getting married!  Jealousy leads to some indiscrete liasons.  Rare film that is pretty hot.",1220745600,32,250,4.613636363636363
