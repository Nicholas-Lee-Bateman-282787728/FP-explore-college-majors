8328417,5,B001NYSWBQ,Very good golf video for intermediate to advanced golfers,1423612800,,57,5.444444444444445
8328418,1,B001NYSWBQ,"This band and video is total garbage! I only bought it hoping for some good golf swing coaching. All the video does is spend an hour talking about the stupid band. It was seriously like an infomercial trying to sell you on who cool the band is! The band this, the band that... Bla bla bla! How about some coaching on the golf swing!? And even if I was sold on the band, its a battle just getting it on right, and it moves nonstop. Can I focus on hitting the golf ball or battling the band. Should I focus and keep my eye on the golf ball through my swing, or should I try to keep my eyes on the little green dash on my wrist. And I rest my case. Completely Worthless!",1396137600,,667,3.985074626865672
8328419,1,B001NYSWBQ,"The device didn't work for me for several reasons. 1st, try looking at your hands when you swinging at a ball.  It's difficult. Also, very slight variations in hand rotation can make a big difference in club position.  The point here is that unless you have major problem in this area, the band doesn't really detect it in a meaningful way.
At the driving range I felt handcuffed.  When picking balls out of a bucket you need to take the swing band off and put it on again.  Of course, this is always going to be required for all shots off a tee.  I found this on-off process to be a pain because the Swing Band has to be re-set up each time.  You can try handling balls with the device on, however, it's much more difficult.
Before purchasing, I recommend that you try securing your hands together with some  rubber bands. Then hit a few balls at the driving range. This will give you a sense of what it's like use the Swing Band.",1279756800,2,931,4.285714285714286
8328420,1,B001NYSWBQ,"Not worth the money. The Swing Band was very tight and broke apart after using it twice. The DVD was terrible. What was worst,
 I sent an email to Hank Haney's website to get a replacement for the broken Swing Band, did not get a response. Sent the item back for refund.
 Sold the other Hank Haney's items purchased on eBay.",1268265600,,324,4.295081967213115
8328421,5,B001NYSWBQ,This is a simple training aid that you can take along to the course or driving range with ease. I am a beginner golfer and it really improved my technique the 1st time I tried it. It is like and orthotic for your swing. I highly recommend this to any golfer at any level. It also makes a great gift!,1251072000,4,299,4.0
8328422,5,B001NYSWBQ,The swing band was helpful for me as a novice golfer and also for my dad who is a pro.  Golfers of any age or ability can benefit from having their swing tweaked with this fun band!!,1249430400,3,182,3.918918918918919
