2420976,5,B000BKDNVM,I've always adored this movie.  Meredith Baxter plays a wonderful Betty Broderick.  True stories have always appealed to me.  This is by far one of my favorites!  If you like Lifetime-type movies you will be hooked!,1138406400,,215,4.888888888888889
2420977,5,B000BKDNVM,"I recently purchased the DVD ""Betty Broderick: A Woman Scorned"", as I have enjoyed this well acted movie on the Lifetime Channel.

To my surprise, this DVD has two movies on it. The first movie of the Betty Broderick story ""A Woman Scorned"" and the Sequel called ""Her Final Fury"".  A total of 3 hours on this DVD! I also noticed that there is a special section on the DVD where you can see the real Betty Broderick and watch some of her actual testimony at the murder trial. Very interesting. I recommend this DVD highly. This is for anyone who enjoys movies bases on real life incidents, crimes and murders.",1138233600,130,608,4.468468468468468
2420978,5,B000BKDNVM,"When I first watched this movie on lifetime it seemed pretty dramatic and over the top for a woman to kill her exhusband and his new, younger wife, but the more I watched how Betty Broderick transformed into a woman scorned who committed murder I could understand why. I mean this woman worked 2 jobs to put her husband through medical school (that was definately from a different era) then law school, and raised 4 children. She built a life with this man to help him succeed and when he got tired of Betty he dumped her for a younger woman.

Unfortunately when a woman like Betty is identified by being Mrs. Dan Broderick, it's extremely difficult to walk away and let another woman step into your shoes after all the hard work is done. It also rubs salt in the wounds when your ex-husband invites the friends you used to socialize with to ""his"" wedding, and they don't remain friends with you, because they hang out with your ex-husband and his new wife.

Betty Broderick was wrong to murder her ex-husband and his new wife, but I totally understand what drove her to do it.",1137801600,13,1077,4.489795918367347
2420979,5,B000BKDNVM,Magnificent story about how bitterness can eat a person alive and destroy your life and those around you.  Anyone ending a relationship needs to watch this as a lesson to just LET IT GO.,1518134400,,186,4.470588235294118
2420980,5,B000BKDNVM,"I used to watch this every time it would come on TV growing up. I almost fainted when I saw this is included with my Prime account lol! Perfect movie for a cold, dreary, rainy day, or any day! Could watch this film over and over.",1514592000,,229,4.0
2420981,2,B000BKDNVM,"One-sided view portraying Dan and Linda as the victims leaving out the dirty details which helped drive poor Betty mad. The prosecutor, Carey Wells was a third rate attorney who graduated from a law school with the lowest bar performance in the country. Very doubtful that Mrs. Broderick referred to her as ""sharp as hell"". There's a reason why the first jury could never convict her. Read ""Until the Twelfth of Never"" which is the real true story, an unbiased account of all the players who admit to  no shame for their parts in the tragedies.",1514505600,2,544,4.666666666666667
2420982,5,B000BKDNVM,"Great acting by all the actors especially Meredith Baxter and Judith Ivey, the actress who played the prosecuting attorney.",1514160000,,123,5.526315789473684
2420983,5,B000BKDNVM,Such a shame how Dan treated Betty.  My aunt knew the family well in the early to mid 80s. This movie is a fair an accurate portrayal of Dans behavior to his wife.,1512864000,,163,3.9393939393939394
2420984,5,B000BKDNVM,"Excellent, film.  I'm sorry for the family.  But, I'd have to say she should went all the way and said why she killed them.  The why would still send her to prison but, I'd have to say I would have been in her position in the early 2000s.  Thank God I got out.",1512259200,,260,3.849056603773585
2420985,5,B000BKDNVM,Every scorned woman needs this DVD. Married to Monsters. All phone kids should take a cue from Generation X. Dump your BUM.,1511049600,,123,4.636363636363637
2420986,5,B000BKDNVM,"This is the ""crazy ex-wife/girlfriend"" story on steroids.  Meredith Baxter perfectly portrays the vindictive,mentally unstable (putting it mildly!) Betty Broderick.  This story is just super sad ....  Betty Broderick literally had NO identity beyond that of being a man's wife.  When the marriage came to an end (as so many do,) she went crazy and killed her ex husband and his new wife while they slept.  This is the ULTIMATE CLICHE .. but, unfortunately, it's a true story.  Wow.  A must watch.  RIVETING.  I really do feel sorry for Broderick.  It must be awful to have absolutely no identity beyond being someone's wife.",1511049600,2,624,4.970873786407767
2420987,5,B000BKDNVM,"Based on a true story which I first saw on the Lifetime network. Became one of my favorites. A truly heart wrenching ending for the husband, his new wife and children and the lives of their families as a result of all that unfolds, yet saw also how Elizabeth suffered inside as well. Very well portrayed by Meredith Baxter who plays the role of Elizabeth Broderick so well!!! A must see for anyone who especially likes court dramas.",1507593600,,432,4.551282051282051

2420992,5,B000BKDNVM,The TV mini-series is a classic.  Meredith Baxter hits this out of the park!,1502064000,,76,4.428571428571429
2420993,5,B000BKDNVM,"True events in this movie about a woman scorned. Superior acting by Meredith Baxter! B. Broderick wasn't right in the taking of lives, but I do believe the husband pushed her over the edge. Divorces happen every day for some of the reasons in this movie. I don't understand why the trial wasn't defended under the reason of insanity. She was obsessed with the former husband, he pushed this insane former wife over the proverbial edge to commit horrible crimes. The former husband (or the way the actor portrayed him) didn't seem like a good husband, in the first place. He used her to further his career & she worked to pay for it. Justice for B. Broderick should have been to seek psychiatric care & move on from the worthless, user of an x-husband. Success is the best revenge not murder.",1501891200,,791,4.577464788732394
2420994,5,B000BKDNVM,Great movie!!!!!,1499644800,,16,7.5

2420997,5,B000BKDNVM,"I loved this TV movie the first time I saw it, and it holds up. The fact that people are still divided over Betty Broderick is a testament to Meredith Baxter's superb performance. She manages to evoke pity for Betty (and I think she does deserve some pity) and rage at her at the same time. I have a feeling she nailed Betty Broderick's personality and behavior.",1498953600,,362,4.417910447761194
2420998,5,B000BKDNVM,One of my top favorites when I saw this two part series on the LifeTime channel years ago.  Baxter's movies are always good.  She plays a perfect part in this true story.,1498867200,,170,4.28125
2421004,1,B000BKDNVM,"I cannot comprehend the 4 and 5 star reviews.  In this case not even sure I t rust they are real.  This was the most toxic show I have ever watched.  I don't know why I watched it (and its labeled tv series, which is why I started it....its not a series, its a movie).  I feel bitter like her because I spent two hours of my life watching her.  Horrible!!!!  A cut and dry case of a seriously mentally ill woman who is not getting treatment.  Period.",1498867200,2,450,4.045454545454546
2421005,5,B000BKDNVM,I can see her side and I think she should be paroled.....she was a victim as well as her children.,1498176000,,98,3.95
2421006,3,B000BKDNVM,"A made for TV movie, and all that implies, with some disregard for the facts.  At least read the Wiki about it after watching.  If you read it before, you probably won't enjoy it as much (if ""enjoy"" is the proper word).  While it was engaging, on some level, and as a social/historical document of sorts (hopefully combined with other research), there was little suspense as it was such a public case.  I remember it.  I remember that the people who held her as a hero were ridiculed, didn't think anyone took them seriously (and I, as a divorced woman, was embarrassed at the sympathy).  The prevailing water cooler opinion was that hanging a woman out for a younger model did NOT warrant cold blooded murder.  It was pretty easy to see through Betty's game.  A tragedy all the way around.  It certainly made people think about their situation and brought this issue to light: whether Mr. Broderick indeed used Betty to get through school, or whether the marriage had massive problems to begin with, and would have ended in divorce anyway.  The acting is fairly good, in a TV movie kind of way.  Baxter received an Emmy nomination, but her portrayal is over the top, although as well done as that sort of thing can be, and possibly the director's only way of giving this story any weight at all at.  She does carry the movie well.  When she is off screen, it immediately lags.  But it is almost a caricature.  It does show her range, though, since she starred in a very successful sitcom at the time, in a role that was the polar opposite of Betty Broderick.  If you have nothing better to do or have an interest in the case, your time could be spent in worse ways...",1498089600,,1668,4.473509933774834
2421007,5,B000BKDNVM,"Although the movie was riviting, I'm disgusted with some of the reviews that blame Dan Broderick for being murdered like this.  His wife, Linda, as well.  Shame on all of you.  NO ONE deserves to be murdered, no matter what they do.  We didn't live with them, and he is dead, so anything ""Betty"" says is only one-sided.",1497916800,,319,4.448275862068965
2421008,5,B000BKDNVM,Fantastic!!!!,1497312000,,13,13.0
2421009,5,B000BKDNVM,"After supporting her husband all through medical and law school while bearing and raising four children, having several miscarriages, and dealing with one still birth (while her husband is off skiing), a suburban California housewife is cast aside by her husband, Dan, for a much younger woman just after they reach the pinnacle of financial success. Betty Broderick has put everything she has into her identity as housewife and mother, and when he snatches that away from her, Betty, who seems on the cusp of mental illness anyway, completely snaps. Dan (and his fiance, Linda) pay the ultimate price with their lives.

Meredith Baxter does a fine job with the role of Betty, infusing her with the proud and polished bearing of a well-off housewife, but also the crazy-eyed look of a woman on the verge. Baxter manages to balance the well-deserved righteousness of someone who sacrificed her youth, looks, and sanity for a man, and the narcissistic rage of a woman who must win at all costs, even if it means destroying her children and herself.

The movie whitewashes Dan Broderick's character, giving only brief hints to the fact that he was culpable in his own predicament - not only by having an affair and then gaslighting Betty by telling her it wasn't happening, but by also fueling her rage with his own childish and mean-spirited harassment. He and his younger fiance used to send Betty cards calling her fat and ugly - none of that is mentioned in the movie.

For awhile, Betty became a media sensation and adopted by feminists. Now she's forgotten in prison (her latest parole in Jan 2017 was denied). It's a tragedy that Betty, who could have had a very nice life of travel, luxury, and boyfriends after she unshackled herself from her worthless husband, couldn't seem to stop from going down this deadly road.",1496361600,2,1823,4.836538461538462

2421011,4,B000BKDNVM,"This is one of my very favorite television mini-series.  The movie is a few years old and the formatting doesn't exactly match the newer HD TV screens, however I haven't played around with the settings to any degree.  Also, it's not the clear kind of picture that you see in more recent movies....but I ordered it for the story line, not crystal clarity.",1492732800,,354,4.603174603174603

2421033,4,B000BKDNVM,"I have seen this movie on Lifetime before, but I wanted to own it as I know many women (including myself) who can relate to Betty Broderick's situation. The movie was entirely too sympathetic to Dan Broderick. He is the one who strayed and then is showcased as a martyr. He was not as saintly as the movie would portray. There are lots of men like him who use women and then cast them away like dirty laundry once they attain their so-called pinnacle of success. Kudos to men who respect women, and shame to those who do not. I can understand her feelings, although I would stop short of shooting my ex-husband. Looking back, he is not worth that trouble. LOL",1475193600,10,659,4.409836065573771
2421034,5,B000BKDNVM,"Very good made for tv movie.  Meredith knocked it out of the park, her acting was spot on.  I did enjoy seeing the scenes that they normally delete when it's aired on tv.",1474848000,2,170,4.121212121212121
2421035,5,B000BKDNVM,Men should think twice about marrying a woman like this. Every church and marriage counselor oughta have this movie. It details about Betty Broderick who becomes unhinged and eventually kills her ex-husband and his new wife. The children suffer the effect of that loss of their father. It's especially sad in part 2 of the movie who she is sent to jail and is on trial. The children have to relive the trauma of losing their father.,1473811200,,432,4.623376623376624
2421036,3,B000BKDNVM,"Knowing the story I think this movie is entertainment only.  If you just want to be entertained and don't care if it stays very close to the facts then this is the one.  It is a pretty typical production for a made for TV type event.  If you are interested in the story there are books that you should probably read first and then watch this if you still want to.  The other thing which maybe only bothers me, but there are no sub-titles.",1470268800,2,438,4.178571428571429

2421060,5,B000BKDNVM,"I bought this a few days ago and I've already watched it twice. It an an excellent movie if you like true crime, courtroom dramas, and two movies on one disc which is so easy to use. Meredith Baxter was excellent in the role of Betty as was Judith Ivery as the prosecuting attorney.

One thing that aggravates is the fact that Linda, portrayed as a wonderful person who could do no harm, was in actuality an adultress who knew from the onset that she was trying to gain the attention of a married man. She had no respect for Betty. Betty had Borderline Personality Disorder as seen from her behavior when things did not go her way. But, in the final analysis her sociopath traits came out also.  which was manifested by her shooting her husband.

This is well directed and quite fascinating to me. Yes, it has been on television, not often, but by buying it you can watch it whenever you choose commercial free.",1445904000,5,911,4.4431137724550895

2421099,5,B000BKDNVM,"I'm such a fan of true story movies. And of the Lifetime movie network. This was such a sensational movie, although it is very long ( A two part movie ), it is definitely worth the time to watch it.

This story is based on a true story, and let me tell you Meredith Baxter played such a great role in this movie. She showed what a truly great actress she is. She plays a wife who after supporting her husband through his schooling and a long marriage, then when she gets divorced she goes absolutely psychotic and homicidal. She can't stand the fact that her ex-husband has moved on and is happy. Although she finds a new relationship of her own, she can't stand the fact that he moves on. She absolutely tortures him and his new wife, I don't want to say to much so as to ruin the whole movie for anybody that reads this. But I will say you won't be disappointed in this movie. I think it does a great job at showing how mental illness affects people. And not just the person struggling with the illness but everyone that is involved in their life as well. I truly believe this is one of the best movies I have ever seen",1408406400,8,1121,4.189814814814815

For example, in the LMN version, doesn't Betty's car get taken away and she's forced to take another car that he picked out for her?  I don't know, something seems off with this version of the movie, If this is one of your fav LMN movies, it's really annoying to watch when it's not the same as you remembered.",1392595200,3,559,4.205607476635514

2421173,4,B000BKDNVM,"I vaguely remembered this case as it unfolded through the courts.  Some of the scenes in the movie depicting Mrs. Broderick's childish behavior (before she became a double murderer) were too outrageous to be believed.  I thought they were embellished for entertainment purposes.  Then, I researched the case & found that nothing was exaggerated; she really is the vile woman portrayed so well by Meredith Baxter.

Mrs. Broderick is due to be released from prison in 2021.  That would be a huge mistake-and likely a very costly one.

It's interesting that the movie is divided into two sections - the crime & the trial/verdict.  The fact that the jury couldn't get it right until the second trial indicates what is wrong with out justice system.

If the DVD had closed captions, I would have rated it five stars.",1360454400,3,811,4.826086956521739

2421176,5,B000BKDNVM,"I saw this movie on tv, was telling my Mom about it then I found it on Amazon. It is a story of how a woman can be verbally abusive to her husband and then keep doing things to him and not get help for herself that she really needs. She really needed to seek professional help after the divorce to get her life in order so she can be out in the world alone again, but she didnt, she kept trying to make his life miserable when he remarried. She was such a mess and instead of getting help she made the whole family suffer for it. She verbally abused her ex husband and then she talked bad about him to the kids, telling them that his second wife was a whore and child herself. She used her daughters key to get into the house when the kids were with her in the middle of the night and went and shot them both, but then kept telling all the lawyers that she was the victim.

My ex should watch this show, then he will see that I was not so bad during our divorce.  This movie shows just how nasty things can get during and after a divorce.  The fact this is based on true life is even more bizarre.  It is unbelievable how mad a person can get.

I speak from experience, I was only about 17 or 18 when I happened upon this classic while channel surfing,  I am sure I had plans that day but nothing got done because of the sheer power of story telling this movie provides.  I sat there and watched the whole thing, both parts commercials and all.  This is a truly creepy exercise in bitterness and revenge that most hollywood films fail to aspire to.  Their is no easy answers in this movie, at times you feel sympathy for betty and at other times you loathe her.  Baxters potrayel of this disturbed woman is nothing short of mesmerizing.  If you have not had a chance to see this tense scorned ex wife from hell thriller than I highly recommend you track down a copy as soon as you can.

There are some things in the movie that didn't make sense.  Like, why did Dan ask his girlfriend to move in with him immediately after the divorce?  Why did he allow his live in girlfriend to go to his oldest daughter's graduation?  Why didn't he change his number or ask a third party to communicate between him and Betty?  Or better  yet why didn't he move?  Then I did some research and I found that this is very one sided.

After doing the research, here is what I think really happened.  I think Betty put him through medical school and law school by working and taking care of the kids, while Dan just goes to school.  Betty grew to resent him and screamed at him after work every evening or acted nutty and Dan dealt with that by avoiding this nagpie even more.  Rather than telling Betty how he really feels, he finds this little gold digger Linda to have an affair with.  Linda puts pressure on him to leave his wife and he eventually does.  Betty has a hard time dealing with the divorce and Dan remarrying Linda and gets even crazier, but Dan makes all kinds of really dumb decisions like inviting Linda to his daughter's graduation.

I think that Betty is totally crazy and she should've just let go of her anger and move on.  She is an insult to women everywhere and is definitely not a feminist.  I do understand why she was angry and I think that Dan should've showed more sensitivity to her or try to understand why she was angry instead of writing her off as a crazy person.  I have a dealt with someone who is angry like Betty, and I have to say that I wouldn't act like Dan.  I would go out of my way to get along with them-I wouldn't start another relationship with another person if my ex had that much trouble dealing with it.  If I did something that upset my angry person, I would apologize instead of calling the cops or scream back at them.",1309824000,2,2184,4.273170731707317

2421199,1,B000BKDNVM,"This movie does such a poor job portraying the reality of Betty, Dan and Linda, it's incredible.  While the movie is compelling, you come away thinking that other than the affair between Dan and Linda, Betty had little to complain about.  Right?
WRONG!

The reality was that Betty became unhinged over systematic betrayal and abuse through her husband who is made out in the movie to be a fairly nice guy (if you can call a cheater a nice guy, that is).  Dan did everything he could to demean her, insult her and take away everything that meant anything to her.  Linda as the other woman taunted her as well.  To call Betty ""scorned"" is an understatement.  Not only was she scorned, she was lied to, humiliated at every turn, mentally tortured...for years and years.

These two co-conspirators did not deserve to be killed but they surely don't deserve to be portrayed as sympathetic kind people who just happened to have fallen in love while some lunatic wife got ""old and fat"" (Dan's words).

Betty may have been high strung but she was driven to madness.  It isn't any wonder she snapped.  She should not have...but she did.  Just goes to show you don't toy with someone's mental health and esteem without taking a great risk.  If you want the true story, try a book.

This movie is fascinating to watch but it is HEAVILY, VERY HEAVILY biased towards the deceased victims.  Betty was a victim long before they were.  She may be alive but the life she should have had is over too.  Sad, sad tale.",1298592000,15,1498,4.550561797752809

Although the story is not accurate (read ""Until The Twelvth of Never"" by Bella Stumbo) these are still good movies. Betty's entire world was based on her family and her husband. He commited adultery for two years with Linda while married to Betty, lying to her about his whereabouts and playing mind games. You won't see this part in the film because the article that this is based on neglected to add those oh so important little details. Instead of treating Betty with respect he treated her like dirt, less than human. Betty's descent was spectacular and devastating. I wonder how this tale might be different if Dan and Linda had apologized for the lies and the deceit. Sixteen years of marriage, nine shared pregnancies with four live births and one child dying shortly after birth (Dan was skiing when Betty when into false labor); Betty did what she thought was right, gave up her career and ambitions to be a good Catholic wife and mother. Dan lied, cheated, controlled the money and fell in love with a younger woman. How would you feel. Oh, and he never..not once...apologized for any of his actions.",1298160000,2,1208,4.729857819905213

The story of Betty Broderick, and her terrible descent into a homicidal rage due in great part to the vicious and foolhardy actions of her estranged husband, is certainly fascinating and great ""entertainment.""  But if you're really interested in Betty's story, and you want a far more balanced retelling of the Broderick marriage than these two movies provide, I highly recommend ""Until the Twelfth of Never"" by Bella Stumbo.  Betty Broderick says that Meredith Baxter never met with her before the movie was made, and that's pretty clear.  The first movie, for instance, implies strongly that Dan didn't begin dating his new wife, Linda, until after he had left Betty.  A complete lie.  They were involved for over two years during his marriage, and his denials to his frantic wife that he was cheating more than contributed to her later breakdown.

I sympathize with her of helping him through law school and the getting divorced, but people do grow apart and personally I felt the lady was in the marriage for the prestige and the $$$ (which constantly glowed in the lens of her eyes.)

2421220,3,B000BKDNVM,"For anyone that has followed Betty's tragic story this movie will come as a surprise because it really isn't the ""Betty Broderick Story."" In fact, this movie is based on a magazine article. I have never heard of a movie that was based on a magazine article, have you?

It goes without saying that Meredith Baxter didn't bother to speak to Betty, instead she took her instruction from an overzealous director (Dick Lowry.) The Betty in this movie is a crazy, manipulative, lunatic. The real Betty Broderick bares no resemblance to her. However, I still felt sorry the Betty in this movie. Because her husband was a totally insensitive gentleman to say the very least. He had no respect for his wife or children.

I never got the impression that I was watching Betty Broderick. Instead, it was like watching Elyse Keaton with a very bad bleach-job. The writers of this ""movie"" did absolutely no research. They didn't bother to explain any of the events leading up to Betty's breakdown.

I did like the part at the high school graduation. It was so funny when Linda made that feeble attempt to put Betty in her place, ""if you snap another picture of me you'll be taking a picture from the inside of your mouth..."" I guess breaking up her marriage and stealing her husband, her children and her home wasn't enough for Linda? But Betty just looked her right in the eye and snapped a picture without blinking.

The movie never conveyed what led up to Betty's horrible breakdown. Instead, they show her buying a gun and screaming hysterically at everyone who will listen. This just isn't her story. Mrs. Broderick has even said in subsequent interviews that this movie helped poison the public's mind because the jury already thought they knew ""her story.""

The second TV movie picked up just after Betty's breakdown is called: Her Final Fury: Betty Broderick, the Last Chapter. This movie aired on TV on November 1, 1992. Again Meredith Baxter plays Mrs. Broderick and Judith Ivey plays the prosecuting attorney.

This movie was more foolish than the first and in all likelihood should not have been made. The movie also incorrectly implied that the children were raised by Dan's family; they actually ended up in foster care.

Again, like first made-for-TV-spectacle, Betty is totally in a rage in the entire movie but nothing is explained or detailed. She is just so filled with hate and angry all of the time. Why? Again, this movie has no resemblance to Betty's story.

If you're interested in learning about the real Betty Broderick, watch some of her TV interviews and read some of her magazine articles. There's also a good book by Bella Stumbo. I do not recomend these movies, unless you enjoy those unrealistic ""women's movies"" that are not based in lucidity or reality.

Obviously I do not condone any type of violence and Dan and Linda did not deserve what happened to them in the least. Of course I cannot speak for Betty but I am pretty sure (based on what I have heard her say over the years and the facts that I have read) that she is very remorseful and sorry for these tragic actions. She is a real person and instead this farce showed a very poor, over-the-top and out-of-this-world characatuer of her.",1188172800,14,3214,4.714795008912656
2421221,5,B000BKDNVM,"Men are horrifed and blame BB entirely; women have quite a different opinion. Meredith Baxter is sensational, as is Stephen Collins (this is the second movie Collins portrays a husband murdered in cold blood by his wife; the other was Nick Dunne's excellent book turned movie ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"", the true story of the Woodward family...and even sadder, both children of the couple committed suicide, one on Mother's Day) and it is like watching a train wreck; you can't turn away and you hope maybe this time they will wake up and escape and Betty will recover, but it is not to be.
DB did everything wrong; he, of all people, knew BB and how deeply she was affected by the loss of her children, her husband and her entire lifestyle; usurped by a young, thoughtless girl who took delight in sending her ads for wrinkle cream and weight loss products,
I also read in one book that Kolkena was a bit of a monster toward the children. Neither Dan nor Linda behaved in a way that was wise or sensible; they seemed to deliberately go out of their way to inflame and harass Betty who was already way over the edge; taunting someone already in deep rage and depression is simply not a good idea.
I in NO WAY condone the murder of two people; (I would have much preferred Betty to win by legal means, but it was just not in the stars.) but I absolutely understand WHY she did it. I am also not surprised to notice that the overwhelming majority of those sympathetic to BB are women and those who vilify her are men; it is common and acceptable, even admirable, for men to abandon their wives for younger women; it happens more than we like to think.
Baxter said she was more on BB's side in the first picture; much less in the second. Either way, she turned in great performances in both features.",1187136000,11,1796,4.445454545454545

2421223,3,B000BKDNVM,"This movie gets four or five stars for entertainment, only 2 or 3 for accuracy.  I suppose its inevitable that with material like a scorned wife driving her car into and otherwise vandalizing her ex-husband's house, they wouldn't capitalize on making this movie as over the top as they could.  And contrasting the husband as a saint for good measure.

If you read just a little,however,  you discover the husband was very far from the saint he was portrayed in this movie.  What he did to his wife and his children (who used to hide in the bushes to get away from him) made me almost believe Betty had some justification.  And I only read about him, I didn't live with him for all those years.

As for Linda, well, I am not married, so I have no personal ax to grind, but I believe that this idea that one should be allowed to have an affair and break up a family with children and go blameless is wrong. Yet in our society, such behavior is considered blameless. Why is it acceptable in our society that women and men should have no morals in this regard?  Women who would never be caught stealing from a store, have affairs with married men with children and don't consider that a crime?  While murder is not an appropriate consequence, there ought to be some consequence because it is not a victimless crime.  At the very least society should regard them with the attitude their low character grants them.  Breaking up a family, the emotional anguish it causes the wife and children should not be an act without consequences. And yet it has none for the person who does this to a family.

I agree with Dot hutelmeyer, who successfully sued her husband's mistress for breaking up her marriage.  There ought to be consequences for doing what Linda did.  And as for Dan, marriage, particularly when there are children involved, is something you should have to earn your way out of, with counseling. Not just walk in one day and say, thanks for twenty years but I've found someone who looks like you, not ravaged by twenty years of working and raising my children,  so I'm leaving you for a younger model. Essentially that's what Dan Broderick did. Shame on him and Linda both.

While no one deserves murder, what happened to Betty Broderick was a crime, just one unrecognized by society.  While she reacted poorly, she was an unbalanced individual (and after years of marriage to Dan no wonder, he encouraged her to think she was crazy by denying his affair) who reacted extravagently in some desperate attempt to get justice for what she felt happened to her, when she was getting justice no where else.

It's interesting in our society that so little is done to protect families from what happened to Betty and her children.  A family is more than an emotional tie, it's also something of a corporation.  Women have been given the vote. Supposedly, after many years, there are now some laws to protect women from battering. But nothing protects a women from sinking years of her life, emotionally, physically and economically into building a home, having children, and raising them in a family and then having her husband, the man she's done all this supposedly for and with, have a cheap affair and walk out one day without any real consequences for him or the mistress --  cheat her not only emotionally, but legally, morally, economically and in every other way. Dan didn't even pay for her divorce lawyer, hid assets, used the legal system against her.  She had no representation in court even to try to get some justice.  What kind of way is that to treat your wife and children?

Women as just supposed to go quietly into the night,set up to fail,  broken emotionally, financially and legally. Society not only allows for this, it expects it, teaching that you get a man for being young and beautiful and to lose one for being older and no longer beautiful is the ultimate disgrace.  But Betty didn't creep away, and that's her infamy.  But part of that infamy is perhaps the recognition within society that she rebelled against an inequity that has yet to be addressed and hurts millions of women and children. It's okay by society to be a mistress, but not to rage out against the person or persons who destroyed the home you spent twenty years building.  For centuries, it was accepted that men would be enraged by someone who stole their wife.  We're allowed to defend our property. But as women, we're supposed to just move on with our lives if someone destroys our family.

Did Betty have other options. Sure she did.  She was no saint either.  Millions of women take the blow Betty suffered, and many of them even recover to some extent.  Some even come back stronger.  That still doesn't make what happened to them, or to Betty, right.  As wrong as it was for her to murder, it was equally wrong that she was allowed to be driven to that extreme. Wrong for her, her children, and even wrong for Dan and Linda. Linda took what she wanted, Dan took what he wanted, and finally, Betty took what was left.  Not a pretty story, and not pretty people, whom a little character all around might have saved.",1172448000,10,5114,4.593612334801762
2421224,3,B000BKDNVM,"For a made-for-tv movie, this one is above average. Meredith Baxter gives a superb performance, as usual. I took off two stars because of the obvious Dan-and-Linda worship going on here, as well as the miscasting of the actors who portrayed Dan and Linda.

Stephen Collins is a competent enough actor, but he was an unsuitable choice to play Dan Broderick. Dan still had a full head of hair in middle-age, and was really handsome and photogenic. Collins just didn't project Dan's charisma on-screen.

Michelle Johnson, while attractive, is not the stunner that Linda Kolkena (supposedly) was. Linda was so beautiful that she turned heads and, reportedly, had a gorgeous smile. Johnson is merely ""cute"" here and is definitely no competition for Baxter in the looks department. This is important because, in real-life, Linda was ALL about her looks. It was all she had going for her.

So, watch the DVD for Meredith Baxter's performance. As Betty, she is charming, funny, shrill, self-absorbed and just plain fun to watch. She's a sympathetic character even in a movie that sets out to demonize her rather than portraying the facts of the case accurately.",1164844800,,1153,4.994791666666667
2421225,4,B000BKDNVM,"""A Woman Scorned"" is television movies at its finest!  Based on a true story, fast paced and culminating in murder . . .guilty pleasure, for sure.  Meredith Baxter turns in a coldly calculating performance as Betty Broderick, rightly being nominated for an Emmy.  She couldn't be further away from Elyse Keaton of her ""Family Ties"" days.  The story is simply too fantastic to be fictional and the viewer very quickly becomes invested in the story.

So what could be wrong with it?  Accuracy.  Dan Broderick is portrayed almost a saint, married to an unbelievable she-devil, who turns to his young assistant Linda for companionship and a romance eventually blossoms once Dan and Betty are divorced.  Read any book, or do any research on the case, and you will see where the bias from the Broderick family participation comes in.  Dan Broderick was hardly an angel, as was his second wife Linda, and they had an ongoing affair for more than three years, before Dan ever left Betty.  It certainly does not justify their murder, but it taints the accuracy of an otherwise impeccable story.

Definitely a tele-movie worth viewing.  Additional bonus is the sequel, although it is not nearly as compelling as the original.",1156809600,2,1215,4.901960784313726
2421226,4,B000BKDNVM,"Okay -- I admit it. Docudrama's are my guilty fascination and this one is especially compelling. A psychological thriller of the first order we are taken into the mind of Betty Broderick, a woman who, like some, is completely identified with being a wife and mother. Exit the husband for a younger woman, and with it goes her sense of self. Desperate to get it back, she embarks on a campaign to sabatoge ex and his new wife. When that doesn't work, she kills him. Of course even that doesn't restore her identity. But, to protect the any fragile hold on functionality she has to believe that what she did was right and she was the victim. I would recommend this because it gets inside the mind (to the degree that any Lifetime docudrama can) of a female killer. Nice switch  from the glut of male sociopaths that normally inundates prime time.",1152316800,3,844,4.552631578947368

The first time I saw it, I was hooked on this case; as Meredith Baxter did such an excellent portrayal of a woman driven to rage.  I must say, though, I had read that the movie was made to be in the favor of Dan and Linda Broderick. If that's true, it did not work for me!  I STILL felt Betty's pain!!  Yes, there is no question that murder was wrong. I wish for Betty's sake she had the strength and means to break away from it all. But, none of us know what really went on and how she felt, what she was put through, or what she was driven to.  From what I've read, watched (the movie and her interviews), I absolutely feel for her.  We never know how we will react to a situation unless we are actually faced with it.

I am not in favor of what she did by no means, but throughout the entire marriage, breakup and thereafter, I sided with her.

She did not deserve to be dumped on.  If only the two-bit women out there knew the pain it causes when marriages are interfered with, if it happened to THEM, perhaps this sort of thing would be thought through.  Ladies, no matter what the situation, STAY AWAY FROM THE MEN IF THEY ARE STILL MARRIED!!!!!!!!!

2421229,5,B000BKDNVM,"Meredith Baxter deserved more than a nomination here - she should have won. However, I think due to the subject matter it wasn't meant to be. Baxter delivers a truly remarkable and sensational performance. I listened to the commentary on here and Baxter admitted she was dealing with a lot of pain in her personal life during the time this was filmed so there was probably some method acting going on here. She easily related to Broderick and became her in every sense of the word. This is THE best made for tv movie I have ever seen. Meredith carries the entire film and never lets you down for a minute. This DVD edition includes part 1 and part 2. You will be mesmerized by the story and the performances so much you will not be able to take your eyes off it. If you are looking to get lost in something for 3 hours on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, look no further. This and the made for tv movie Winnie, where Meredith plays a mentally handicapped woman is her best work by far. This should definitely be included in any DVD library. Do not miss it!",1146182400,3,1055,4.333333333333333

This movie is a true story.  It took place in SanDiego, California.

Betty Broderick started out as a loving wife and mother.  She worked hard; worked very hard to put her husband who began as an ER md I believe....through law school.  He becomes a renowned lawyer; is very successful and makes them both rich.  Betty is finally able to stay at home to raise their 5 kids and the two of them are enjoying the good life.  Right about this time, a new young attractive secretary begins employment at Dan Brodericks lawfirm.  It doesn't take long for the two of them to become attracted to one another.  Betty suspects and goes into a jealous rage, burning all his clothes for starters.  One thing leads to another and he divorces her, and marries his secretary.

What the movie does not portray is the fact that Dan Broderick had a habit of screwing around on his wife.  In the movie, he is portrayed as the injured party along with his new wife, who in my opinion, is a two bit home wreaker.  She knows he is married, and still goes after him.  The two are murdered in cold blood by Betty as they slept.

I don't feel they deserved what she did, however, I felt sorry for her as he took everything away from her that he had given her, that she helped to build.  They built a great life together, money was no object, and then he throws her away for a younger woman.  Granted, she is a spiteful, jealous lunatic that goes way overboard with some of her actions; however, he is no angel in this relationship, and that is the part that the movie does not show.

This movie is excellent because it is based on a true story; even though all the true facts are not portrayed.  I think anyone that wants to see a really good courtroom thriller should buy this movie....it will keep you riveted to your seat right till the very end.  It is a great movie and Amazon's DVD has both movies on it...the first one, ""A Woman Scorned:  The Betty Broderick Story"" and the sequel, ""Her Final Fury; Betty Broderick The Final Chapter"".  Anyone loving a thriller will relish this great work.",1146009600,21,2213,4.356968215158925
2421231,5,B000BKDNVM,"Maridith Baxter really nails this character. This was the first TV movie that I ever saw her in after Family Ties, and I just couldn't believe it was the same actress. Stephen Collins and Michelle Johnson also do a great job as the new Mr.& Mrs. Broderick. Not to mention the actors and actresses that play the kids of this shattered family. To think that anyone would have to go through that is surreal.",1140566400,4,404,4.472972972972973
2421232,5,B000BKDNVM,"OK so i admit it I am a LIFETIME junkie and I make sure that i do not miss this one when it repeats, and it does ALOT.  Meredith Baxter gives a convicning performance of ""that woman scorned"" and although she she murders in cold blood her x husband an his new wife as they lay sleeping peacefully in thier bed in the middle of the night, I still felt sorry for her.  The movie starts from thier life together that she helped create while working to put her husband in law school, so that one day that they can have this wonderful life together, as she put it, he took her home, her kids, her friends and her life. Stephen Collins played her husband who after several years of marriage decides he wants a younger more attractive woman an they begin this affair, which is quickly found out by Betty. A lot of women can relate to the loss of love and freedom that Betty Broadwick loses but when i watched this movie withmy husband he could not help but saying ""what a bitch she was."" I think it depends on which side of the coin you look at it.  One of my faviort lifetime movies. Baxter deserved a Emmey for her performace.",1139356800,47,1120,4.224299065420561

8087745,5,B000BKDNVM,"5 stars for Meredith Baxter portraying Betty Broderick. There are many dynamics and perspectives in this case. The problem is that Betty committed murder and still touted the story of a battered woman. It is difficult to read/hear/examine her side of the story when she's killed the two people whom were allegedly causing her so many problems. Murder was not the answer here. I think she is where she needs to be, in prison. She deserves to be in prison, she murdered two people, the father of her children. It seems her children's pain comes second to hers. How do her kids explain to their children that Grandma is in prison because she killed Grandpa and his second wife? How does Linda's family explain to younger family members that Linda is no longer around because she was murdered by her husband's ex-wife. The emotional and mental dynamics involved are far greater than Betty ""serving her time"". I feel for her but only in regard to her lack of self-respect. I left someone many years ago and had to give up nearly everything so that I could get out, and carry on with my life. It amazes me how prison inmates with parole denied because of a lack of remorse do not understand the remorse factor. I do not think she is a danger to society but if her own flesh and blood thinks she should remain in prison than that is enough for me.",1524096000,,1340,4.495901639344262
