4432740,5,B004MQ6W5K,"I saw this series when it was first on TCM, and loved it.  I kept watching for it to come out on DVD, and pre-ordered it to get it sent ASAP.  Anyway, I love to watch the earliest history of making of films and the earliest pioneers.  It was too bad that the ones who started it all were either pushed aside or refused to conform to the changes. People who watch this for the first time will be surprised who really started it all.

I could watch this over and over, since I am such a fan of the old movies.  Anyone who wants to learn the TRUE history of Hollywood should DEFINITELY buy this set.",1305676800,6,596,4.05982905982906
4432741,4,B004MQ6W5K,"""Moguls & Movie Stars: A History of Hollywood"" is a three-disc DVD set that provides an excellent overview of the development of the American film industry from its peepshow beginnings.  Each of its seven segments covers approximately a decade.  Unfortunately, the overview ends with 1969, when most of the studios had been absorbed by conglomerates. Therefore, such topics as the rise of the independent film, development of digital technology, competition from pay TV, computers and personal devices, and the resurgence of 3D are not addressed.

However, what is included is first-rate and well edited.  Film aficionados might be frustrated that many of the clips are quite short, but the scholarship and information imparted make the series a rich experience that even the most avid fans will embrace.  The series details the personalities, relationships, collaborations, and conflicts that created an industry and an art form while also looking at how moviemakers responded to major historical events, such as the Great Depression, World War II, and the civil rights movement.  Footage of moguls Louis B. Mayer, Jack Warner, and Lou Wasserman is included.

Most of the moguls of the title were European immigrants who turned to movies from other businesses when they sensed opportunity and saw the growing popularity of the flickers.  They also liked that people paid to see a movie and then left without taking it with them.  The movie could be shown over and over to new audiences as the nickels and dimes added up to big dollars.

The first three episodes offer some of the best material.  These represent the silent period and cover the contributions of Thomas Edison, Georges Melies, and the Lumiere brothers as well as early inventions such as the kinetoscope and nickelodeon.  Later material may be more familiar, but those episodes, too, contain solid, fascinating information.",1304899200,28,1889,5.218543046357616
4432742,5,B004MQ6W5K,This is a great series for anyone interested in movies and their history! It is so well done. The comments by the film historians tell you things you never knew before. I highly recomend it.,1304726400,8,190,4.457142857142857
4432743,5,B004MQ6W5K,"Moguls & Movie Stars: A History Of Hollywood is an excellent documentary series that originally aired on Turner Classic Movies in late 2010. The series covers a wide array of material from the beginning of cinema in the 1880's through the decline of the mogul dominated Hollywood studio system in the 1960's, with everything in between. The set is divided into 7 episodes on 3 discs, running approximately 7 hours. Also included is a 40-page booklet with vintage photographs and each episode has bonus reflections by film historians and writer/producer Jon Wilkman. I will include a very brief description of each episode and the people discussed within them. Each one contains much more than I'm listing and gives you a great idea of how Hollywood went through its many transitions.

Episode 1: Peepshow Pioneers (1889-1907) - The series begins with a look at film in its infancy, taking a look at people such as Thomas Edison, Auguste and Louis Lumire and Georges Mlis. Also covered is the role of the newly arriving immigrants in America and their role in shaping the history of cinema, particularly in starting some of the earliest Nickelodeons for people to view movies.

Episode 2: The Birth of Hollywood (1907-1920) - Most early American movies were filmed in and around large cities, such as New York and Chicago. These locations proved problematic for a lack of variety in shooting locations and for legal reasons. To solve their problems, many key players in the industry began to migrate west to California, establishing Hollywood as a movie maker paradise in the 1910's. Included in this episode are legends such as Charlie Chaplin, Samuel Goldwyn, Cecil B. DeMille, D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish.

Episode 3: The Dream Merchants (1920-1928) - The 1920's proved to be the decade that brought us true Hollywood moguls. Many of the previously mentioned immigrants had accumulated vast amounts of wealth in their Nickelodeons, prompting them to produce their own films. Upon moving to Hollywood, many of them founded their own production studios which lead to the creation of many of the companies we still know today. Included are Louis B. Mayer (MGM), Adolph Zukor (Paramount), Carl Laemmle (Universal), and all four of the Warner brothers.

Episode 4: Brother Can You Spare a Dream (1929-1941) - During this period the film industry faced some major changes and hardships, such as the introduction of ""talkies"" and the Great Depression. This period also marked the arrival of many European filmmakers to Hollywood (Billy Wilder, Alfred Hitchcock and William Wyler to name a few), bringing with them unique styles and perspectives which would change movies forever.

Episode 5: Warriors and Peacemakers (1941-1950) - When America entered World War II the future of Hollywood was uncertain. Many filmmakers actually joined the military and saw combat, such as Frank Capra, John Ford, William Wyler and George Stevens. The directors took these experiences and made patriotic films and documentaries which helped our countries morale and helped rally us through the end of the war.

Episode 6: The Attack of Small Screens (1950-1960) - As the title says, this episode covers how Hollywood changed in response to growing popularity of Television. Many of the studio moguls were forced out during this decade which lead to a change in how movies were made. Films were now more realistic and a new generation of actors thrived in the new environment. Included are Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Sidney Poitier, Marilyn Monroe and James Dean.

Episode 7: Fade Out, Fade In (1960-1969) - The last episode of the series covers what was basically the death of the old Hollywood system. Most of the moguls had either died or been forced out of the companies they started. Power shifted to directors and a few other individuals, such as agent Lew Wasserman, who is covered extensively in episode seven. The 1960's also marked another huge landmark in American cinema, the abolishment of the Hays Code, which had restricted movie content for decades. These factors, along with a new appreciation for foreign films, lead to what is now commonly called ""New Hollywood"".",1304467200,97,4183,5.097810218978102

4432760,3,B004MQ6W5K,"NOTE: This is about the program, NOT the seller.  It's hard to follow in the footsteps of at least a dozen earlier documentaries that cover the same territory, and ""Moguls & Movie Stars: A History of Hollywood,"" despite being earnest and well-financed, turns out to be more retread than exploratory. The story of Hollywood is not linear, but there are better ways to tell it than by contriving such episodes as ""Brother Can you Spare a Dream"" (the Depression and talkies), ""Warriors and Peacemakers"" (WW2 and the Red Scare), and ""Fade Out, Fade In"" (the birth of modern Hollywood). Indeed, ""Moguls and Movie Stars"" is less about moguls (Columbia's Harry Cohn is practically a footnote, as are such second generation moguls as Dore Schary, William LeBaron, Pandro Berman, Ken Hyman, and William Goetz, than about the films that TCM owns. Scholars Tom Schatz, who wrote about the studio system, is hardly heard from, as is Leonard Maltin; Jeanine Basinger, Daniel Selznick, and Sam Goldwyn, Jr., are highly credible and used well; but TCM's Robert Osborne -- both here and in the special features interviews -- flails like the lightweight he is. Jon Wilkman, who wrote and produced the series, achieved the near-impossible by finding stills and footage rarely, if ever, seen in other documentaries. He also bravely and correctly writes about the Patents Trust, Paramount Consent Degree, Blacklist and consolidation. But there is a blandness to his style that renders the whole series colorless. It's a shame that the industry's premiere television movie network, with its monumental resources, made such an ambitious and yet forgettable series.",1375833600,6,1642,5.172932330827067

It tells the story of Hollywood from the perspective of the real people who ran the studios --- the Moguls. From the pioneers(think D.W. Griffith)and the heads of the studios such as Louis B. Mayer, Daryl Zanuck, the Warner Brothers and Harry Cohn, it covers the very early years from penny arcades through the 1960's which saw the collapse of the studio system.
I watched this documentary on TCM when it was run as a weekly series and I just watched this set on a rainy day in its entirety. I thought it was just as interesting the second time around, but it probably had a bigger impact while watching it all. It details the stories of the Moguls as a group as well as individuals and takes into account the challenges that were faced over the years by the studio which included a serious economic depression, wars, unions, tempermental stars, the changing tastes of audiences, and the dreaded 'T' word --- television.
Using vintage film clips merged with interviews it makes a strong case for why the studio system couldn't survive while also documenting the glory years of the Hollywood moguls and their decline.",1316995200,3,1197,4.704761904761905
4432777,4,B004MQ6W5K,"Moguls and Movie Stars attempts to capture the period of movie history when studios were the over-arching factor in the creation of films. It is an ambitious and huge undertaking. The story is told in seven parts, all broken up into eras, but it is still overwhelming at first glance. So many people had a hand in the studio system, especially when you factor in the small studios, and when they were beginning, many formed, disbanded, and re-formed with different players. For example, before Samuel Goldwyn struck out on his own, he was Samuel Goldfish who was kicked out of several endeavors into the movie business. To make matters more confusing, the story cannot be told without talking about the actors that made it all possible. And when money matters come in, well, it will take a few views to really get the full scope of the information.

One flaw is one that could not have been avoided without using footage from other documentaries. Most of the people involved firsthand have passed away. The experts we have here are film historians, all of note, but they cannot possibly tell the story with the gusto that firsthand accounts could have. These men were entertainers and showmen just as much as the actors they depended on, and considering other documentaries which interview greats such as William Wyler, John Huston, or Sam Goldwyn, this one falls short. What we get is a more serious outlook with fewer jokes and humorous behind-the-scenes stories.

This latter series covers film through the silent era and just the beginning of sound, as an explanation of why the silent era ended.

Peepshow Pioneers (1889-1910), the first part of Moguls and Movie Stars: A History of Hollywood, a seven-part series scheduled to premiere on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) at 8 pm (ET/PT) on Monday, Nov 1, is an exceptional piece of business history. Chronicling Hollywood by tracing its origins to the inventors, immigrants, Jews, salesmen and businessmen who were its creators, men such as Thomas Edison (who perfected a device called the Kinetoscope that made pictures move), Auguste and Louis Lumire, Paramount Pictures founder Adolph Zukor, Marcus Loew, Carl Laemmle, William Fox, the four Warner brothers, and others during the Industrial Revolution, this 60-minute documentary, narrated by Christopher Plummer (The Sound of Music), takes the viewer back 100 years and introduces the exciting new art form that would change the world.

Peepshow Pioneers covers Edwin S. Porter's film for Mr. Edison, The Great Train Robbery (1903), one of the first films to tell a complete story, and how, in 1905, enterprising Zukor and Loew united to establish theaters to show movies, called Nickelodeons (combining the price of seeing a movie, a nickel, and the Greek term for theater). The prospective consumer was among the poor and the emergent middle class, a new phenomenon which American capitalism was creating for the first time in man's history, not the titled, the intellectuals and the wealthy. Much like Pixar founder and Walt Disney board member Steve Jobs and Apple are revolutionizing personal technology, Mr. Edison built relationships with investors and manufacturers, including Eastman Kodak, establishing the Motion Picture Patents Company (which the government forced out of business) and demanding royalties from filmmakers. Some chose to compete with Mr. Edison, including Laemmle, who formed his own production company and created Universal Pictures.

This first installment of A History of Hollywood: Moguls and Movie Stars, written and produced by Jon Wilkman, who began his career making CBS News documentaries, working with Walter Cronkite and creating programs for HBO, NBC, and the History Channel, is appropriately reverential of, if not always sufficiently thorough about, Hollywood's incredible history of capitalism, arts and entertainment. Using rare and never-before-seen footage, including an early film featuring gun-toting Annie Oakley and moving pictures of men departing for the Spanish-American War, and important places in filmmaking history, such as New Jersey, New York, and Pittsburgh, the writing and the pictures are astonishing. I haven't been this excited about watching a larger-than-life story unfold on television since Alex Haley's Roots. Among those interviewed are various film scholars, studio mogul descendants, and historians, including, in later parts, TCM host Robert Osborne.

Additionally, and underscoring the cable channel's commitment to quality programming, TCM is currently touring a related exhibit which features unique memorabilia, including an Oscar for Casablanca, a costume worn by Christopher Plummer in The Sound of Music (1965), a dress worn by Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind (1939), a red jacket worn by Marilyn Monroe in Niagara (1953), a vest and coat worn by Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik (1921), an original bound script from Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), a signed check from MGM to John Gilbert, the highest paid star in the silent film era, a vintage camera from the silent film era and a demonstration of a zoetrope, a precursor to motion pictures.

Part two, The Birth of Hollywood (1907-1920), is as excellent as the first episode in the seven-part series (Peepshow Pioneers), tracking Henry Ford's perfection of the assembly line process for Ford Motor Company, now the nation's only private automotive manufacturer, and its profound effect on moviemaking. Marking the influence of women, immigrants, and Jews, proving that capitalism (not socialism) encourages elimination of ignorance and bigotry and advancement of human progress, this part looks at the rise of movies as an industry.

Other highlights include the controversial film made by Kentucky native D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915), a box office hit regarded by many as racist that was actively supported by the radical Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, which was arguably the nation's first commercially successful spectacle; the fascinating story of Hungarian immigrant Carl Laemmle's creation of Universal City, an actual city invented to foster his Universal Pictures studio; the government's early attempts at censorship; and the rise of the movie star in Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford. The Birth of Hollywood will be followed by such silent classics as George Loane Tucker's movie about sex trafficking among immigrants, Traffic in Souls (1913), and Griffith's Birth of a Nation.

The third episode, The Dream Merchants (1920-1928), covers the movies' silent era, from Rudolph Valentino and Greta Garbo to Gloria Swanson and the Fatty Arbuckle scandal, The Dream Merchants, with Christopher Plummer's crisp and elegant narrative, keeps the focus on making art and money as Hollywood truly became a glamorous Tinseltown. Topics packed into this 60-minute program are spread too thin, and we lose track of the titans of movies as several factors come into play, but the production, including film footage, is amazing. One gets a strong sense of what is essential about each major player and creator.

Watch short scenes from Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments, D.W. Griffith's Orphans of the Storm, of Valentino dancing in Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and Chaplin, Lloyd, Bow, and Garbo, among others (too much Joseph Kennedy, not nearly enough of Buster Keaton), doing what made them legendary. By the 1920s, businessmen had made motion pictures into a hugely profitable industry, the fifth largest in the country, and had achieved real artistry, despite the claims of one of the more idiotic talking heads here (an Ivy League academic, author and former television writer).

Part four features the studio titans, stars and movies of the day in facts and pictures, from the demise of heroic Carl Laemmle, who saved hundreds of Jews from the Nazis, Sam Warner, who understood the importance of technology, and hardworking William Fox, on the eve of his takeover plans, to Shirley Temple, Bette Davis, the unsung (and, among today's dominant black intellectuals, disowned) Hattie McDaniel, and the still-breathtaking 1939 screen adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's brilliant novel Gone With the Wind.

Both sound and the Great Depression brought changes to Hollywood, and one learns that most of the great studio titans, who were Republicans, risked their fortunes to make motion pictures. We also learn the widely unknown fact that America's bankers, Wall Street capitalists, and businessmen like Howard Hughes rescued studios, investing huge amounts of money and building creative houses that sponsored such original talents as Barbara Stanwyck, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire, James Cagney and the ""American Garbo,"" Katharine Hepburn, who ""knew what she was worth"", demanded it, and got it. Hepburn wasn't alone in setting her terms; Astaire convinced studios to shoot his whole body during dance scenes, writers were granted autonomy in creating some of the best scripts, and, raising the ire of conservative Catholic Production Code chief Joseph Breen, comedienne Mae West combined wit and sex to become the highest paid woman in America in 1935.

Other highlights include a luminous photograph of actress Carole Lombard, a shot of scientist Albert Einstein with wealthy comedian Charlie Chaplin, the dedication of producer Irving Grant Thalberg to motion pictures as an art, actor Edward G. Robinson, artist Walt Disney compared to Thomas Edison, Columbia Pictures, the decline of scandalized Clara Bow, whose career ended at the age of 28, and the rise of dictatorship in the West. With a glaring exception, the absence of any mention of Soviet influence among Communists in Hollywood during the Red Decade (the 1930s), the badly titled ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dream?"" is interesting and entertaining.

Bringing the series to the 1940s, ""Warriors and Peacemakers"" (1941-1950) part five, falters. Giving more screen time to Mickey Rooney than to Howard Hawks, John Wayne or Gary Cooper, who made Meet John Doe, Sergeant York, and Ball of Fire in 1941 alone, the episode loses perspective. When it comes to presenting the facts of Communists in Hollywood, the series goes pink if not entirely red.

It does contain a few insights, briefly covering legendary director John Ford's ability to create a movie on time and under budget, assuring his creative independence, and demonstrating that Joseph P. Kennedy (the assassinated president's father) was a Nazi appeaser who tried to force the moguls to remove Jewish names from picture credits to placate those who were exterminating Jews by the millions. Narrator Christopher Plummer, who famously portrayed a refugee from National Socialism, reminds us that government intervention harmed the studio system with a Supreme Court decision against Paramount for having an alleged ""monopoly"" while President Franklin Roosevelt considered targeting Hollywood's moguls for making too much money.

Then it's back to the rose-colored lens, with pro-Communist speakers, such as the vacuous Gore Vidal, actress Marsha Hunt, and the obnoxious son of writer Dalton Trumbo. Communist Trumbo is practically lionized here while TCM discards any mention of the most oppressive regime in history, the Soviet Union, which is proven to have infiltrated Hollywood. TCM blatantly evades Soviet sponsorship of American movies and the treatment of Communism in Hollywood is dishonest.

What may be the greatest movie ever made, Casablanca, is practically regarded as an accident. Instead, we get more proselytizing about Big Labor, Soviet apologist Lillian Hellman and the anti-business picture The Best Years of Our Lives, while Walt Disney, an anti-Communist, Jimmy Stewart (It's a Wonderful Life), a veteran, and more deserving stars than Marsha Hunt and Mickey Rooney, such as Barbara Stanwyck, John Wayne, and Gary Cooper, are practically blacklisted. As those appeasing Soviet Russia are treated as martyrs, movie stars such as Cary Grant, described as an insecure actor, barely merit a few lines.

The Communist-slanted ""Warriors and Peacemakers"" impairs the series' credibility, which is unfortunate, since the first four episodes capably present a captivating history of the business of making movies.

Part six, Attack of the Small Screens (1950-1960), marks the arrival of television. Among the highlights in this one-hour feature are bits on Lucille Ball, a woman with real studio power in Hollywood, Louis B. Mayer and others including Judy Garland, Billy Wilder, and Alfred Hitchcock, who, after describing himself as a producer and being asked what he produces, responded with the answer: ""goosebumps."" The episode covers an important period of transition in movies, which someone rightly remembers as an ""era of philosophical disturbance"", from classic romantic fare to realism with stark, neurotic themes and method actors such as Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift (Red River). Also covered here: Jimmy Stewart, Jack Warner, James Dean, Elizabeth Taylor, Stanley Kramer, Sidney Poitier, Burt Lancaster, and the influence of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.

TCM's fine host Robert Osborne explains why wealthy comedian Charlie Chaplin was run out of Tinseltown at the age of 63, after it was discovered that the preachy Communist was not an American citizen and therefore did not pay income tax like everyone else. The segment on Walt Disney, who is seriously underreported in this series, is informative, reveling in the Midwesterner's intermedia interests in creating arts and sciences across multiple platforms and his brilliant plan to finance the creation of Disneyland through a television network (ABC, now owned by the studio that bears his name) featuring his innovative motion picture-driven theme park as a work in progress.

But the series' problems continue, with a feminist's attack on actress Marilyn Monroe (1926-1962), one of the screen's most talented comediennes, who is also one of Hollywood's most innocent victims, reduced here without objection to a tart who ""makes women look bad,"" an outrageously baseless assertion from a bitter source. I have never heard such an explicit assault on this skilled, feminine actress, one of the few truly deserving of the term movie star, the premise of this television series. Besides more falsehoods about anti-communism, more blather about nothing from Gore Vidal (who offers no value in the series), and a distinct lack of performance and film clips, the most glaring omission is one of the decade's top box office stars: Doris Day, an immensely talented artist who is completely ignored. But it's hard to take any of this seriously after the despicable, misogynistic attack on Marilyn Monroe.

The last episode, ""Fade In, Fade Out,"" (1960-1969) covers Hollywood during the Sixties. It is not a pretty sight.

The series, with more of the same Soviet and communist apologia of the last few episodes, gets it partly right that the 60s saw the rise of government power over Hollywood and America, though it isn't put that way. Yet the facts are plain for anyone to see. Hollywood's Golden Age was over, with moguls making way for upstarts tapping into cultural turmoil and going dark with horror movies like the zombie picture, Night of the Living Dead, an asinine exercise in nihilism which made $42 million in international box office, or Stanley Kubrick's vacant 2001: A Space Odyssey or his satirical Dr. Strangelove, a favorite of the New Left. Somehow, movies with middle class appeal (the incisive In the Heat of the Night, the sexy and exciting James Bond pictures, the enthralling The Sound of Music starring series narrator Christopher Plummer) managed to get made. When they did, they usually made money.

Studio titans like Jack Warner were still around, hating hippies and wondering how Tinseltown went counterculture and it's left to New Hollywood writer and director Robert Benton (Kramer Vs. Kramer), seeing movies as distinctly American, to recall the era's confusion, noting that the studio system, which had been all but destroyed by the government, gave way to mediocrity, with the worst thrown at artists and audiences alike.

The most interesting business tale comes from Richard Zanuck, who at age 27 suggested himself to his Fox studio boss dad as the executive to save the struggling studio (though curiously there's no mention of Fox's 1968 hit Planet of the Apes). But this was the beginning of the dark times, with the rise of the Cannes Film Festival, and making money was out of fashion. Somebody mumbles that publicists handed out drug cigarettes at movie screenings and admits that many of the 1960s movies were made under the influence of drugs. Doris Day, Katharine Hepburn, and Cary Grant stepped aside for unwashed hippies and drug addicts and the sorry sight of Joan Crawford in a fright wig catfighting with Bette Davis or a Cro-Magnon man. This is what Hollywood, born of inventor Thomas Edison, bankers, Jews and capitalists, the most hated types in the modern world, powered by men like Laemmle, Zukor, Fox, DeMille, Disney and Warner came to. It was during the Sixties that anything remotely coherent, attractive and appealing was mocked, mutilated, or killed and anything larger than life barely stood a chance of getting made, let alone sold and seen. At least TCM host Robert Osborne reminds us that future filmmakers of quality made it through this awful decade.

The series' closing episode will be presented with such films as the insightful Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? (1967), horror film Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) and The Magnificent Seven (1960) on Dec. 13, as well as the era's dark, horror-themed pictures, George Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1969) and Easy Rider (1969) on Wednesday, Dec. 15. Don't expect to feel the Christmas spirit by watching a batch of zombies and glorified murderers, drunks and drug addicts; those movies are devoid of peace, love and good will, but they do represent the 1960s and they coated the way with slime for today's malevolent muck.

So it is fitting, in a way, that TCM ended its History of Hollywood in the Sixties, which marks an end to Hollywood's beginning and, with nihilistic No Country for Old Men being considered Hollywood's best picture, possibly a beginning of the end of a bright and innovative art form that was born of great creators over 100 years ago.",1307923200,7,16831,5.327936746987952
