8501117,3,B006MSIUQA,"The sound and the video was off the entire time.  The video lags 1 or 2 eight counts behind the music.  There is a story line to this production, and I, along with the people who I was watching it with, knew some basics about the plot (loosely based off Greek mythology).  It was entertaining guessing who was who and what was happening, but it would have been great to have a synopsis of the plot before hand (especially since some of the characters turned out to be Norse gods!).  This had its problems, but in the end it was fun to watch with my belly dance friends.",1386288000,,569,4.2407407407407405
8501118,5,B006MSIUQA,"I bought my copy from Jillina's website. It is in a cardboard case similar to the ones used in Cheeky Productions DVDs but without the plastic DVD holder.

I've been itching to see this show ever since I first stumbled upon the Bellydance Evolution YouTube channel. The group has been touring the world for over a year, but the DVD didn't come out until they had been on the road for quite some time so I was very excited to finally get to watch it.

For those who are not familiar, Bellydance Evolution was created by Jillina. It follows a story, much like a ballet. This is something I have been interested in seeing in a bellydance show for a long time now. I have Suhaila's Scheherazade which supposedly has a story it follows, but I didn't get that feeling from it. The story in Bellydance Evolution is a love story using classical mythology figures such as Medusa, Persephone, Apollo, Loki, etc. Although these characters typically have set characteristics, they did not in this show. They all did things that don't make sense in their classical roles, so when I watched this I had to put my knowledge of mythology aside. I knew that going into it, so that probably helped me enjoy it more.

Production Quality
The overall quality of the video was great. The video and sound were clear, the DVD menu was easy to follow, the lighting was perfect. My only complaint is that the camera changed a bit more than I would have liked, and did more close ups that I liked. I enjoy being able to see the whole dance from straight on, unless there is something very specific going on which is best viewed up close. I don't like the background dancers being cut out while the camera zooms in on the lead dancer. I like to see everything and get the overall effect. Although I felt like I missed a lot of the grandness of the choreographies because of close up, it was still enjoyable. On the plus side, the set and lighting were really great. The stage was pretty bare, but it worked well. There were no backdrops, just some pillows and soft curtains. There was lighting equipment in the back of the stage, but somehow it worked. The lights would change color and flash according to what was going on in the show and the overall effect was great. The mood was enhanced by the dramatic lighting, and it was clearly used to its best advantage.

Dancing
The dancing is, of course, fantastic. Everyone of the dancers is amazing. There is, of course, Jillina. But every dancer she brought in was perfect. They each brought their own flavor and style while still having a great group cohesiveness. Each dancer's style was used to enhance her character and fit perfectly. For example, Sharon Kihara makes a fantastic Oracle. Her style went well with the idea of the exotic, mysterious and somewhat unusual character. Jillina plays the jealous Medusa and does a great job. Kaeshi plays Pandora and her piece where she opens the box and torments Apollo is one of the best in the show, in my opinion. Louchia's grace and charm make for a perfect Aphrodite, who plays the part of matchmaker to the warring lovers.

The dancers were also great at being theatrical and dramatic. Because there is a story, they all had to convey some things we as dancers are not used to doing. They each had a different role to play and I felt everyone embraced their characters well.

The two men who were Georgrian dancers were amazing! Their dance style was so masculine and high energy. It was a great way to ad variety to the show without making it into a circus act. I felt like the dance style was perfect for embodying two male deities.

There was some fusion of other dance styles such as Indian, ballroom and of course the two men danced their Georgian style. But for the most part it was bellydance and it all worked together well. There was even folkloric elements which traditional dancers can appreciate. Instead of feeling like I was watching a string of pieces with different things tossed in for variety like a BDSS show, it felt like the variety was a result of the characters and the story. I've never seen a show with so much variety, yet such cohesiveness and great flow.

The Story
As I said, the story is loosely based on some mythological figures. Apollo falls in love with Persephone. Medusa is interested in Apollo, and becomes jealous. Loki is in love with Medusa, but she doesn't notice him. Medusa conspires to take Persephone away and gain Apollo's interest, and the story unfolds from there. Mythology wise, none of it makes sense. But standing back and looking at it from a simpler perspective it makes more sense. For mythology buffs this might be a bit annoying. Other than that, the story is pretty simple and flows well. I didn't read the summary until after I watched it, and I felt like I understood what was going on despite that. Changes in the story were made pretty clear. There were only a few dances where I was left wondering what it had to do with the story, and they were mostly pieces where a character was dancing to show their character as opposed to progressing the story. I think it all worked pretty well. Some pieces were particularly well done when it came to expressing the story and characters, such as the beginning of the first dance with the Oracle. It was very dramatic and I got a deep sense of the mystery and ritualistic nature of the Oracle. At the end there is a bit of a dance party feeling and a high energy drum solo with live drummers ends the show.

Costumes & Props
This was a theatrical show, so the variety in the costumes was as numerous as the characters. There were classical cabaret costumes, tribal, fusion, and Indian. Some were created to embody a specific scene, such as the backup dancers for the Oracle who wore gauzy off-white costumes evocative of smoke. Other costumes were just made to be the right color needed. Medusa wore some great black costumes that fit her character really well. They were all beautiful and well done.

There was a variety of props used that all fit the story. From feather fans, silk fans, Isis wings, veils, light up and regular canes, sword, and candle tray. Props were used to convey a certain message or needed piece of information. Blue and white silk fans mimicked rain and the ocean. Light up canes became magic dancing swords when the lights were turned down. Two small veils were used to represent the love of the leading female characters. I didn't feel like props were being paraded for the sake of variety. They were necessary to tell the story.

Overall
In conclusion, I think this is one of the best Bellydance stage shows to date. It brings something new to the table and elevates the dance to a higher level without making it into a circus show. Anyone, regardless of if they are familiar with bellydance or not, can enjoy this show. I think this is a step in the right direction as far as theatrical bellydance and I am excited to see what else it will inspire dancers to reach for!",1342483200,,6976,4.555023923444976
8501119,4,B006MSIUQA,"Bellydance Evolution ""Immortal Desires"" is a belly dance theatrical based loosely on the mythical characters of Ancient Greece - Persephone, Apollo, & Medusa- as a ""Love triangle.""

I loved many of the concepts and ways they used dance and expression to tell the story. Sharon Kihara as the Oracle in her first scene of her character, she was just amazing. You just knew she was otherworldly. The scene where Persephone (Heather Aued) & Apollo (Zurab Dudsahvili) first meet is also fun to watch. The way Apollo looks at her and the way Persephone leads the dances, her veil represents her love & their bond- it just comes together beautifully.

But at other times, it's easy to get lost. I was having a harder time trying to follow other parts of the story because what was being conveyed was not always clear to me as a viewer. Persephone is crying and running around franticly because she has been captured? Is she dreaming? Is she lost? Another was, Loki pretending to be Persephone to trick Apollo scene was a little confusing. I wasn't sure what was going on until nearly the end of that scene.

The story is printed inside the DVD jacket, but it's so detailed. You would have to read it and then have it with you while you watch to understand exactly what's happening. I just want to relax and be entertained, not have to reference the story to understand what's happening. The dancers on the other hand, were absolutely great, not only with dancing but with showing emotion and expression. (Acting!) They did a great job.

The Georgian male dancers that played Apollo & Loki, were so amazing! There was a fabulous sword fighting dance sequence & incredible spins! These guys added a wonderful masculine element to the bellydance theatrical that I have never seen. I loved it! As I watched the show progress, I kept wishing there was more of their dancing.

The level of dancing & choreographies on the whole were professional, appealing visually, and interesting to watch.
They used costuming, color, and props to convey feeling or help tell the story. There is a great dance piece where they use silk fan veils to represent the waves of ocean or water, really beautiful to watch. The opening dance sequence, the ""lovers"" Persephone & Apollo, the Georgian Male dancers, the Oracle, Aphrodite and the finale, where everyone comes together and dances. (Every dancer gets to showcase themselves- Kaeshi does a candle tray dance, Jillina does a great can dance on a drum!) were my favorites. Only a few of the choreographies lost my visual interest. (You know, you get bored pretty quick.) but I think that is normal.

Overall, I would recommend this DVD. ""Immortal desires"" was a very good performance, with great costumes, music & dancing. I wish I could have seen it live. I would have loved to give a 5 star rating but because of story issues (hard to follow at times) & the some of the choreographies where not visually strong, I had to give it 4. Even though, I am glad I bought ""Immortal Desires.""",1331856000,,3007,4.729007633587786
