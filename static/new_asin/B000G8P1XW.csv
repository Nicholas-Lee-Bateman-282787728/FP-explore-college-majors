8129520,3,B000G8P1XW,"You get two movies in this. I actualy didn't buy this...it came in my Brand new sealed DVD that was supposed to be the 1914 silent called ""Squaw Man"". I would be reviewing that movie now if the case had the right movie in it.

I probably would not have bought this DVD but since I watched it I might as well letcha know. Both movies had good stories and were easy to follow, though the second one (Frontier Outlaws) did leave you guessing where they were going for a bit. In the second there was some rediculous editing when you see every one pass by the exact same scene several times when it was supposed to be a different scene further along the ride, so that was unintentionaly comical. In both movies Buster Crabb plays Billy the Kid. Is it thee Billy the kid? because in these movies he's the hero, and as far as I know Billy the Kid was a villians villian. So some twisting of History might be going on here in 1945. The second movie sees Buster Crabb disguise himself as a Mexican, and I can't think of who he reminds me of but it was another actor perfectly...but who...?
  There were attempts at humour by the side kick (Fuzzy) which were poor, exagerated and poorly executed, and there was a so-called Courtroom scene that was supposed to be funny but it was more rediculous than anything. Kids would like both these movies, and were probably suitable for them too. The villians, and they are credible villians at that, get their just reward in both movies...something missing all too often in todays movies.
  Overall these were OK family movies, but some of the attempts at humour were so lame they brought them down somewhat",1337731200,,1638,4.464882943143813
