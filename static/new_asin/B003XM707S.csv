4217183,5,B003XM707S,Glad I didn't purchase the original releases...this one would have made them obsolete! Very cool set and glad to have it!,1290038400,,121,4.809523809523809
4217184,5,B003XM707S,"I love this set. The Mystery Machine is in great detail. The wheels actually move and the mystery machine can actually be used as a toy. It seems to be built quite strong to withhold some pressure. The back opens up to hold the 8 discs that contain all 41 episodes of Scooby Doo Where Are You. The discs are exactly the same as the original releases by WB, minus the double sided disc from season 3. The eighth disc includes bonus features not included in the original set. The only dislike I have is the cardboard sleeves used to hold the discs. They are tight but the top is loose and free so only the bottom of the disc is held in the sleeve.
 This set is only second to my Flintstones set. When the Mystery Machine is in the plastic case it came in it is about the same sizes as the Flintstones Complete Series set. The Scooby Doo set is built stronger than the Flintstones set, but I have to say I love the Flintstones more than Scooby Doo. Not compared to the cases, but sole based on the show. I highly recommend this Scooby Doo set to anyone who loves Scooby Doo or any collectors out there.",1289260800,32,1099,4.208530805687204

4217186,5,B003XM707S,"This set will contain all three seasons of the original Scooby-Doo series, universally referred to as Scooby-Doo Where Are You? (despite the fact that the third season was officially titled The Scooby-Doo Show). This show is a part of many people's childhood regardless of what generation they are apart of. Originally airing in 1969 it became a classic and that's why even as a child growing up in the nineties I remember watching this series every morning almost religiously. It became so loved that its various incarnations have continued to air from 1969 to this very day in 2010. It also spawned three live action movies and countless animated movies. All that aside, Scooby-Doo Where Are You? is where it all began and what some (myself included) regard as the best. This limited edition collector's set contains three seasons of Scooby Doo, 41 episodes in total spread across 7 discs.

This set will also contain all the special features released on the previous two individual sets. ALSO an eighth disc will also be included and contains NEW BONUS MATERIALS.

Previously Released Special Features Included In This Set:

*Featurette: Scooby-Doo's Ultimate Fans
*Get the Picture: How to draw Scooby and the gang
*Funky Fashions
*Music Video: America Loves Scooby-Doo
*Scooby-Doo Street Smarts

Special Features Exclusive To This Set:

The best reason for fans to buy this complete series set, aside from the eighth disc and its new bonus materials, is the unique packaging. The discs will be held in a plastic Mystery Machine that sits on a decorative stand. The back end of the mystery machine lifts up to reveal discs that sit in cardboard sleeves (I'm not thrilled about the cardboard sleeves but I've dealt with them before and the rest of this set looks so great I can overlook them). If you haven't bought the series this is a great opportunity to get the three seasons in one set and for those who already bought those sets, myself included, the unique display packaging makes this set worthwhile for hardcore Scooby-Doo fans, again myself most definitely included. I'll definitely be getting this as a Christmas gift. Hope this was helpful, I'll update if I learn more and then once I finally hold the product in my hands, Scooby-Dooby-Doo!!!",1280793600,373,4148,4.6530054644808745

4217196,5,B003XM707S,"Honestly I am impressed. I read some comments and they weren't very good. People were complaining about the Mystery Machine case being in bad shape and yeah the fake front bumper was shifted a little. I actually kept the DVD case that held all the discs, that was inside the fake van and just threw van away. The case is not why I bought this. I bought it so I could show Scooby Doo and the gang to my kids. The picture is way better than I was expecting! It has all the episodes I remember watching when I was a kid! My kids can now watch the movie, Scooby Doo 2 (the live action one) and understand where the Creeper, Tar Monster, Black Knight & Pterodactyl ghosts and more came from!

4217216,5,B003XM707S,"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! is a classic 1969 cartoon series. This show is very funny, entertaining, lighthearted, and a blast to watch. This is one of those cartoons that doesn't really age. Anyone can watch this show and enjoy it very much. The 80's and 90's had my favorite cartoons, but this show from 1969 is just as enjoyable.

The show is about a group of kids and their lovable dog who solve mysteries that are often supernatural. They are always followed by a monster or spirit of some kind, but in the end, it's always a person in a costume. The monsters are sometimes threatening, but the show has a lot of goofyness, and the characters and monsters often do funny and silly things.

This boxset contains all 41 episodes of the series. It's a really fun show, and it's PERFECT for Halloween. I highly recommend it.",1509062400,,824,4.5608108108108105

4217220,1,B003XM707S,"The product looked like it was going to be great however. There was no care to the packaging when the item arrived the whole top of the mystery machine box was cut along the top of the box. This was supported to be a nice collection and box piece to put on display but due to the damage I had to throw the packaging away, secondly it was saddling to note that the dvd cases that hold the disk in place arrived demanded and the box does not properly close because the plastic file piece in the case itself was also damages.",1507766400,,522,4.127450980392157
4217221,4,B003XM707S,"Here it is: the cartoon series which started the great pop-culture fad. ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"" introduced the world to characters who have become internationally recognized and beloved. How many Saturday morning hours did I sit in front of the television with Scooby and the gang? Not sure, but t was a lot. Of all the Scooby Doo series which have aired, however, the classic original stories are the best.
One reason I don't like the newer incarnations is a huge change in the way the stories are presented. In these stories the ""ghosts"" and ""boogymen"" all turn out to be people in costume perpetrating extremely elaborate hoaxes. And they all have a take on the classic tag-line from the show ""...And I woulda got away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids!"" For my taste, this is the essence of what Scooby Doo was and by making the monsters real, the entire flavor of the show is changed. And by the way, this was my introduction to the wonderful world of horror stories. The lack of real monsters makes this collection ideal for helping children realize that first, there are no real monsters and second that it can really be fun to be scared.
My favorite ""ghost"" has always been Captain Cutler in his glowing diving-suit. The ""ghost"" of the alien runs a close second.",1506384000,,1289,4.608695652173913

4217236,5,B003XM707S,"Since this series started, at the time I am writing this, there have been over a dozen separate Scooby-Doo series dating back to this original in 1969 - and 30 movies! .  Something that has been SO successful to have this many ""sequels/prequels/etc.""  and close to 50 years of continuity tells us something - that you can't miss what started all this!

This DVD series has every original episode in the order they were aired.

The plot varied little from episode to episode. The main concept was as follows:
 -  The gang is driving in the Mystery Machine (van), when their van develops engine trouble or breaks down for any of a variety of reasons
 -  They quickly find out they are stranded somewhere with monster problems and start to investigate
 -  They generally split up; with Scooby and Shaggy getting chased by the monster and fleeing in fear
 -  Generally Velma figures out the clues and Fred sets a trap to catch the monster
 -  They are successful, the monster is unveiled to be someone they've met
 -  The person behind the mask says ""I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids""

There's often a lot of humor in here - for kids and adults alike.",1497571200,5,1187,4.47196261682243

4217267,5,B003XM707S,"I love my Scooby-Doo and this was a great addition to my collection. I don't keep the movies in the Mystery Van, because I don't want to be taking it in and out all the time. The DVDs come in a nice plastic case, where each DVD has their own spot, and you can flip through all the disks to find which one you want. They even have a list of the episodes on the plastic case, on the inside. So when you open the plastic case, you will find each season disk list of episodes on the inside front cover and inside back cover. Also there will be two disks (one on the front and one on the back) of each disk holder, there is four. The packaging will protect your DVDs for years to come. The episodes were great quality and I was not disappointed. The Mystery Machine, itself is cardboard, but it is still nice quality, but I put it up on a shelf for decoration, because I don't want it to be damaged. If something falls on top of it or squishes it, it would be damaged and probably not fixable. That is why I don't use it to hold the disks. But it's not cheap cardboard, so if you wanted to use it to hold the DVDs you could. This is also a better bargain than buying them seasons by themselves. I highly recommend you purchase this, if you are a Scooby-Doo Fan! Or just love the old Scooby-Doo, before they started messing with how they all look like in the newest TV shows.",1483920000,,1369,4.092936802973978

Second set of three DVD's are the Hanna-Barbera version of Scooby Doo series, with the Hanna-Barbera theme music. All have the original voices. My grandson particularly likes the original theme music, he begins dancing to it as soon as he hears it. Sadly he does not relate in the same way to the Hanna-Barbera theme music, but that is just his 2 yr old personal preference.

But this series of DVD's  are much better than the Scooby-Doo series on Nickelodeon  now being shown which are designed more for teenagers.

4217286,5,B003XM707S,My only complaint is that the producers of the dvd didn't improve the picture quality - when we watch reruns of the original series on tv the quality is much better than on the dvd.

I put Season 3 in quotations because these episodes were released 8 years later, in 1978 and are now considered the 3rd season of the Scooby Doo Show which ran from 1976 to 1978. Several Scooby Doo episodes were aired between the second and third seasons including The New Scooby Doo Movies, and the two other seasons of the Scooby doo show. I have collected almost every Scooby doo episode up until 1980 when the show temporarily dropped Fred, Velma, and Daphne. You can get all but 9 episodes on Amazon. These 9 episodes are missing from the New Scooby Doo Movies Series as several of the guest stars wouldn't agree to have their likenesses released on the set.

4217372,5,B003XM707S,"I have fond memories of saturday morning cartoons in the 70s. Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! was my favorite and the only show the whole family would watch together.  During commercial breaks we would each name who we thought was the villian and wait anxiously for the mask to be removed. But it didn't end there. My sisters and I would be sent outside to play (that's what we did in the 70s) and we would make our own mysteries. Hours of fun dreaming up mysteris, with our own unique monsters and villians.

Fast forward 40 some years...I have yet to find a TV show my whole family can enjoy together, while being age appropriate, and inspiring imaginative play. So we've gone 'old school' and brought the joy of Scooby and the Gang into our home thanks to this complete set of the original Scooby-Doo series. It's a huge hit with young and old alike!

QUALITY: 
Because these were created in the late 60s/early 70s, I expected a grainy picture and poor sound quality. Not so. Picture and sound are good.

VALUE: 
Worth every penny. I'm looking forward to the bonus features too.

PACKAGING: 
I'm normally not a fan of packaging that is much bigger than the product. While the box is way bigger than the actual DVD case, it is the BEST BOX EVER! Full color Mystery Machine in two pieces big enough to hold action figures and made-up villians.

UNEXPECTED EXPERIENCE: 
My 6 year old loves the Mystery Machine box! Hell 'drive' it around the living room acting out the show as we're watching. He'll pause only briefly to retrieve an unrelated toy which he reimagines into a monster, villian or one of the Gang for the creative play the show inspires.",1452816000,16,1645,4.583617747440273

4217377,5,B003XM707S,It was delivered earlier today and I was so happy! All of the discs were there and there are no missing episodes. The only problems is that part of my disc case is cracked and broken and the plastic covering looks like it was cut. None of the discs have any scratches or other problems so the crack and the cut in the plastic isn't a huge deal.,1452384000,5,344,4.073529411764706

The external packaging slowely comes apart, but my guess is that is due to low quality glue. Other wise it arrived well before the posted date (Standard slow mail) and worth the money.",1451952000,,273,4.708333333333333
4217383,5,B003XM707S,"I am a huge fan of the original Scooby-Doo series; I grew up with the reruns on Cartoon Network. When I saw this pop up on Amazon, I had to get it (read: ordered it for myself for Christmas). The product looks exactly as described, and the Mystery Machine was an adorable way to sell the DVDs. There are 8 discs in all, and they are stored in a plastic multi-disk DVD box about an inch wide, like you see when buying full seasons of TV shows. The box sits in the back of the Mystery Machine packaging. Though the pictures don't show it, the back of the van has a plastic handle that allows you to pull out an insert which holds the box of DVDs.

The box did have a funny smell when I first unwrapped the plastic wrap. It's a standard new package smell, but it's quite pungent until it has the chance to air out for a few hours. After that it's perfectly fine. The package is just made of printed cardboard, so it isn't the most elaborate display piece, but it certainly has the nostalgia. A full 5-star rating for the creativity of the packaging, and the fantastic opportunity to have all of the original Scooby-Doo cartoons on DVD. Time to go relive my childhood.",1451865600,,1164,4.290909090909091

4217513,5,B003XM707S,"A wonderful box set of the classic Scooby Doo series. The product came in perfect condition and met to my standards.

I bought this DVD set as a gift for my mother. I grew up watching Scooby Doo with her, and as her favorite show, I felt it would be a wonderful gift. I was certainly right. She loved it and immediately began to watch them. It brought back good, nostalgic feelings. If you have a  Scooby Doo fan in your life and are looking for a gift, look no farther.

The case is in the shape of the Mystery Machine and is made of a cardboard material. Once you slide off the cover, a DVD case holding a series of DVD's is revealed. The overall product feels a little cheap, but it does well and the aesthetics make up for it. The only problem I noticed as that the grill of the Mystery Machine is only slightly glued on. A simple bump against the entertainment center caused it to begin peeling off. A little bit of glue would be an easy fix, however.

Overall, the product met my expectations and proved to be a valuable gift.",1437004800,4,1032,4.223350253807107

The discs are all numbered, but they don't coincide with the numbering on the case.  It looks like they used the same label on the discs as when the seasons were sold individually. So the box says season 2 are discs 3 and 4 but they are labeled season 2 disc 1 and 2.  Not really a big deal once you are familiar with them.
They all have the Play All option on the discs which lets you watch 1 -2 hours of shows in a row. Or you can choose the episode you want to watch.",1425168000,3,711,3.816326530612245

4217752,5,B003XM707S,"Shaggy, a beatnik from the UK with a known gift for pleasing the ladies, visited America in search of good times and adventure. He stumbled upon a small runt of a puppy in front of a hole carefully placing his feces under his front paw and scooping it into the hole (an odd habit for a canine)! They had awesome adventures together until one day Shaggy was induced into a coma by a combination of weed and speed, known in the late 60's as ""Zoinks"". Shaggy would awaken from the coma maybe only once or twice a year for the next thirty years. His nurse, Velma Lippowitzkonsin, a transvestite Go-Go dancer from Indiana with the stage name ""Jinkies"", would care for him as much as she could. She would read mystery novels to him on her shift for the next 15 years, hoping that one day Shaggy would awaken and begin rehabilitation with Dr. Hyde White in the Fred Ascottingham Hospital. Sadly, his only visitor was his cousin, Daphne. (There is no record of her last name due to the fire at the hospital in 2007).

Shaggy woke for the last time in the spring of 1999..the wretchedly foul stench coming from under the bed had jarred him awake. Not one nurse nor attendant had dared to step one foot in the brightly colored pastel room , not even crack the door open due to the smell in years. As he sat  on the edge of his bed, filled with molded graham cracker crumbs from the last nurse who cared for him over five years ago, he was determined to find the source of the smell. His frail legs, too weak to support his bony frame, collapsed as he slid off the bed and unto the floor.  The last sight that Shaggy ever saw was a rotted old leather dog collar surrounded by the skeletal remains of a canine...with a dog tag that had the initials SD.",1424304000,,1740,4.314984709480123

4217888,5,B003XM707S,"I did have the collection with the plastic van, this one is SO much better.

The outer plastic box the van sat in was very flimsy and it was just a chore to get the van out because it was tied down. The cardboard box on this one is very sturdy (naturally if you let your children play with it, it won't last long) and I love how easy it is to access the discs, just pull the back out and there they are in a case instead of those sleeves the other set has that can scratch up the discs. The box is very bright and colorful plus it features the whole gang, which the other one did not.

I am very pleased with this set, I can keep the case with the discs on my DVD shelf and set the box with my other collections and it looks so nice sitting there. There is really no need to comment on the cartoon, one of the best of all time and I am definitely one of those who believe the original Scooby is the best.",1420761600,2,904,3.8548387096774195

4217893,5,B003XM707S,"Cute packaging, although I'm unsure what one is suppose to do with the van after purchase, and all the DVDs arrived still in their respective holders - no mean feat if you read reviews of other series collections.

4217896,5,B003XM707S,"I got to tell ya.  Those dvd's were not for the granddaughter, they were for me.  I grew up watching Scooby doo and there probably isn't a movie or show made that I have not seen.  I must have passed my love of it on to my granddaughter cause every time she comes here she always points at them and says ""puppy mamme""?  We sit down together and watch a whole disc.

4217927,5,B003XM707S,"I got this for my 4 year old son who loves Scooby Doo. It's a lot easier having just one case compared to having multiple and you also run the risk of getting duplicate episodes (happens quite frequently). So this was for sure worth the money. This series comes in a Mystery Machine case. The case isn't that great and gets beat up quite easily. The DVDs are basically stored in a case within a case. There are 8 DVDs total and 41 episodes total. Episodes include:

-What a Night for a Knight
-Hassle in the Castle
-A Clue for Scooby Doo
-Mine Your Own Business
-Decoy for a Dognapper
-What the Hex Going On?
-Never Ape an Ape Man
-Foul Play in Funland
-The Backstage Rage
-Bedlam in the Bigtop
-A Gaggle of Galloping Ghosts
-Scooby-Doo and a Mummy, Too
-Which Witch is Which?
-Spooky Space Kook
-Go Away Ghost Ship
-A Night of Fright Is No Delight
-That's Snow Ghost
-Nowhere to Hyde
-Mystery Mask Mix-Up
-Jeepers, It's the Creeper
-Scooby's Night with a Frozen Fright
-The Haunted House Hang-Up
-A Tiki Scare Is No Fair
-Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Werewolf?
-Don't Fool with a Phantom
-Watch Out! The Willawaw!
-A Creepy Tangle in the Bermuda Triangle
-A Scary Night With a Snow Beast Fright
-To Switch a Witch
-The Tar Monster
-A Highland Fling With a Monstrous Thing
-The Creepy Case of Old Iron Face
-Jeepers, It's the Jaguaro!
-Make a Beeline Away from That Feline
-The Creepy Creature of Vulture's Claw
-The Diabolical Disc Demon
-Scooby's Chinese Fortune Kooky Caper
-A Menace in Venice
-Don't Go Near the Fortress of Fear
-The Warlock of Wimbledon
-The Beast is Awake in Bottomless Lake

There are other special features thrown throughout the discs that include how to draw the gang, music videos, fan favorite cases, and how the artists/animators collaborate among themselves and with fans. A bonus disc includes celebrating the world-wide fame of Scooby-Doo, how the series began, and the original actors share memories.

Overall there are seasons 1, 2, and 3 on these discs. It's perfect to be able to keep everything in one place and not have multiple cases strewn about and I would highly recommend it because it's a lot cheaper paying for one set like this than multiple DVDs.",1419984000,6,2192,4.644329896907217

Now I can watch it again and understand what's going on with the Subtitles feature. The Special Features are unfortunately not closed captioned/subtitled. Not such a big deal anyway. Packaging is awesome. Don't let the box's size fool you. Once you open the box, you'll only see the narrow center slot that hold the plastic case. That's it. Nothing else. Additional space could be used for some cool prizes such as Hot Wheels Mystery Machine, little Scooby doll, keychain, etc. Or at least evenly space out the dvds within the width of the box for easy access, instead it was crammed into one tight case.

4218109,3,B003XM707S,"Just to clarify, this set contains all of the ORIGINAL episodes from the first incarnation of the show, entitled ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'', including the revival season that came many years later. However, the remaining episodes of the revival season are not included in this set, as they were broadcast as part of ''The Scooby-Doo Show'' (which is available on DVD under the name ''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour'').

Sadly, the ''sequel'' series are not included in this set either. As some may know, the show came back under the title ''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'' (unfortunately, the DVD set of that omits several episodes) and later ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' (of which only season 1 is available on DVD). Finally, the show ends in ''The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo'' (available in full on DVD). There was also a prequel: ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'', which is also available on DVD. After that, the show was rebooted.

Furthermore, this set does not included the many animated movies done by Hanna Barbara. So we are in fact missing quite a bit. But if you only was the first incarnation of the show, it's available here with a bunch of bonus features.",1409961600,4,1159,4.938461538461539

We even went to see Scooby Doo Live many months ago and met the cast.  My oldest grandson kept telling me he didn't have any Scooby Doo movies even though I have bought several for him over the years. (That's code for he didn't have all of them in the cool Mystery Machine box.)  I decided to get him his own complete set because he watches mine here often. Remembering his face and excitement when he opened the present and saw Scooby Doo will always make me smile. I can see more Scooby Doo complete sets in the future for other grandchildren.

I guess because of my age I prefer alot of the older cartoons and movies.",1409443200,3,791,4.225165562913907

4218146,5,B003XM707S,"I grew up with Scooby-Doo and his pals. These cartoons are something that will never get old or outdated. I plan on passing them on the next generation to enjoy. This Hanna- Barbera series features Scooby Doo, a dog who joins Velma, Daphne, Freddie, and Shaggy on many quests to solve mysteries. Each mystery is new and unusual and involves the group stopping bad guys. Scooby-Doo is a large, loveable but cowardly Great Dane who hangs around four high school students (Fred, Velma, Daphne and Shaggy). The four teen-agers were in constant search of mysteries and adventures, driving around in a bright green van known as the Mystery Machine. Many of the group's adventures involved villians who took on supernatural disguises (ghosts and monsters); the villians' activities usually involved blackmail, theft, fraud and other forms of corruption. At the first hint of trouble, Scooby-Doo (and usually, Shaggy as well) went running for cover; they usually found themselves in even deeper trouble. It usually took the promise of a Scooby snack to get Scooby (and Shaggy) to come out of hiding. The mysteries were always solved by the end of each show.",1408406400,,1149,5.020942408376963

The newer ones they have tried to make on cartoon network suck (sexualizing, overally drama with their relationships, and just plain out suck)!!!!! So i had to get these so my kids could really get a chance to watch and fall in love with scooby doo. Now the reason why I did 4 stars instead of 5. What they come in is a cardboard box pretty much of the van it's not like plastic toy van it seems to picture. It's not really what I would  consider to be a collectors kind of thing. The dvds are just in a plastic dvd holder.

I grew up with the original run of cartoons like Scooby-Doo, Jonny Quest, Frankenstein Jr., and The Archies.  When my kids came along, Saturday morning cartoons had pretty much gone by the wayside and nothing that was out appealed to them.  I found some of the cartoons I grew up with on VHS, introduced them to the classics, and they were instantly fans of the old.  They are both grown, but they still love their Scooby-Doo, so this collection was a must have for them.  It includes all of the old TV series episodes and the cartoon movies.

The clarity is great and all the discs come in one box so no having to open multiple boxes just to get out one disc. I could have done without the Mystery Van packaging. I know some people really love that kind of novelty but I'm just not one of them. It's just a big cardboard box that houses one dvd box.

What's up doc ... high silver ...  were fascinated to me as I had no idea what they mean .. Scooby Mystery Machine was also my favorite and I always scour the then TV guide to find an affordable time to watch it on broadcast TV.

She began watching Scooby Doo last year on Youtube and loved them. But the newer versions of this show are terribly sexist. Daphne and Velma are way more passive than they were in the 60s/70s. (So strange!)They talk about boys and makeup and make comments about themselves as if they are stupid.

We love the old Scooby Doo and this fits the bill! I normally don't buy box sets of anything, but since Netflix doesn't run the older Scooby Doos, we had little choice.",1389571200,,595,4.5092592592592595

With past bad experiences with DVDs, I make it a priority to watch my DVDs as soon as I get them. I'm super pleased that my DVDs were not defective. They all played well. The box it came in is super cool. I was expected to be disappointed because of negative reviews for the packaging, but it was a box that a user named David uploaded in the products photos.

4218304,5,B003XM707S,"I chose to give this complete set five stars because this is a wonderful family-friendly cartoon program. Some very young children may be afraid of the ghosts in the stories (which is understandable) but I would say by the time they reach seven years they would probably find it a fun show to watch when they are in the mood for some laughs. I wouldn't doubt that they will soon be singing the catchy theme song as well. In recent times the Scooby gang have dealt with relationship issues, Velma definitely has slimmed down and drawn much more attractively than these original cartoons. But I prefer these originals: Lots of laughs and not meant to be very serious. After all, it's a talking dog who, with Shaggy, has an appetite that can never be suppressed. These original cartoons are innocent fun with nothing to concern parents of young children (who are old enough to laugh at the ghosts, not cry). I'm glad this series has become available to DVD. I was watching it on Boomerang network for a while but that is no longer an option for me. I am in my 50s and I still enjoy this hilarious series. I hope to watch it with my grandchildren as well as my own children. For me, Halloween is a great season to pull out this series. My ONLY concern is the packaging. I may decide to use my own disk cases and make my own 'boxed set' that not only will last longer but also saves more space on my shelf. But as far as the series goes, it's great.",1387411200,2,1444,4.351851851851852

However, after receiving this and looking at it, I had to post regarding the container.  First - the inside of the wagon has all of the DVDs in cheap paper sleeves, no box, no slimline box, nothing.  Also, the front bumper of the van is a separte piece of cardboard to create a little 3d effect - however it's so shoddily attached that mine was falling off when I took it out of the box (no fault of amazon, it was well padded and secure).

For someone just looking to get the episodes in one collection, I have nothing to fault at all.  However, if you were looking for a nifty little design to put on your shelf, this isn't worth your time.",1387324800,27,840,4.318471337579618

It couldn't be exchanged because it was on sale and they sold out of them, so I kept it and glued the piece of the box/case that was damaged.  I also thought the dvds would fill the box, but it comes with one (thick) dvd case that is too small for the box.

They watched Scooby the entire way and from my 15 yr. old son down to my 7 yr. old son, all 4 kids enjoyed the dvds. This helped keep the arguing to a minimum (actually, mostly nonexistent!). They all wanted to start from the the 1st dvd and watch them in order, so there was no discussion needed when one dvd ended and  the next one selected. They didn't even get through the whole set.

About the Product:

First off, you get a Mystery Machine - one that is your very own! It's awesome, yet, it would be better if it had wheels that made it roll. At the back of it, there is an handle that you pull. It makes a box slide out and it holds the DVD casing. It contains all three ORIGINAL seasons of Scooby Doo!

Also, when you look inside the Mystery Machine while the box is out, it has tire tracks on the bottom! The detail in its art is incredibly awesome! All members of the Scooby Gang are shown on the outside along with the labels being in the right places.

Recommendation:

If you are and/or have a Scooby fan in your life, this is a necessity. I would recommend it to anyone that I would know who would enjoy it.",1368921600,,966,4.036649214659686

4218401,4,B003XM707S,I love Scooby-Doo but was a little disappointed that it came in a cardboard van.  I bought one earlier for my daughter-in-law and hers came in a plastic van.,1368662400,,157,4.413793103448276
4218402,4,B003XM707S,"But the wheels didn't spin on my box, which is good and bad. (It didn't roll off the table, but we can't play with it either, lol) My box is really sturdy and they must have registered the complaints in the other reviews, because the dvds came in a hard plastic case. Seasons 1 and 2 are of course very good, but too short. I couldn't force myself to watch any more after that, I didn't like the other Scooby show! :( All in all kinda wish I'd just bought the seasons - cheaper - since the van didn't turn out to be a toy.",1368662400,,522,3.980952380952381

My other 3 year old granddaughter loves it as well.  It is so nice to see a family cartoon that is souly intended to be enjoyed and without many of the negative aspects you see with many of the cartoons today.  Very pleased with the quality as well. The Mystery van was a big hit as well to store her stuff in. Money well spent!,1368576000,,506,4.070707070707071

This includes all shows from 1-3 seasons. And there are a good many shows NOT in here!! Where are they?  This is not complete, and there are more monsters and also all the shows including Scrappy, and Scooby Dum. Can't they put all the shows together, instead of sneaking around and placing certains shows on volumes, and bits and pieces here and there, and just make it all plain and simple and put them altogether?",1366675200,4,582,4.429906542056075
4218414,5,B003XM707S,"There is some false information in the reviews for this. First off, this box set is not missing any episodes of the series ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You!"" The ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"" series originally ran for two seasons, broadcast from 1969-1970. Both of those seasons are here, amounting to 25 episodes.

The success of the series lead to an hour-long series in 1972 called ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies."" This series is partially available on DVD, but is not included in this set.

Scooby-Doo returned in 1976 with 16 new half-hour episodes that were paired with another Hannah-Barbara show (Dynomutt, Dog Wonder) in a series called ""The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour."" The 16 episodes were later retitled ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" for reruns and are sometimes referred to as Season 1 of that series. These episodes aren't included, but are available separately.

In 1977, 8 more episodes were produced under a 2-hour package called ""Scooby's All-Star Laugh-A-Lympics."" These episodes were also rebroadcast as part of ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" and are referred to as Season 2 of that series. Scoobs also appeared in 16 30-minute segments of the ""Laff-A-Lympics"" series with other Hannah-Barbara characters. None of these episodes are in this set.

Which leads to 1978, when 16 more episodes were produced under the name ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"" 8 of these episodes were broadcast with the original series' opening and closing credits. When the lineup changed, the remaining 8 were aired under a package called ""Scooby's All Stars."" Like the `76 and `77 episodes, when these episodes were reaired, they were listed as part of ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" and are often referred to as Season 3 of that series, in addition to being known as Season 3 of the original series. These are also sometimes called the ""lost"" episodes. Since they were originally aired under the name ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"", Warner released them on DVD as the third season of the original series and included them in this set.

Based solely on the seasons that were produced under the name ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"", this box set collects those 41 episodes produced from 1969-1970 and 1978 and presents them as ""The Complete Series."" It's not a lie. It's not false advertising. It's just not a compendium of every Scooby-Doo series that ever existed, which is what some people think it is.

The packaging of this release is cardboard, but is fairly sturdy. It's definitely not a toy. A plastic version was previously made and has been out of print for a few years. That version housed the discs in cardboard sleeves, prone to scratching. In this release, all 8 discs are housed in an extra-wide DVD case, presenting them more securely than the previous release. This case fits nicely inside the drawer that slides out from the back of the Mystery Machine packaging.

If you're a big fan of Scooby-Doo, this is a nice way to collect all of the ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"" episodes. This is the original series and is still considered the best Scooby-Doo series ever made. If you're looking to collect every episode of Scooby animation that's ever been made, this won't be the last Scooby-Doo set you purchase.",1366588800,"2,443",3175,4.967984934086629

It finally arrived today and I was dismayed to see that it was not what everyone else reviewed. The item everyone had reviewed at the time, and the one being shown on the gold box page, was the original version of the box set which was full plastic with rotating wheels. What us gold-box-buyers actually received was a cardboard box that had a large plastic DVD case sitting inside it. What's worse, these aren't even specially printed versions of the DVDs. They are the exact DVDs that came in the original individual season box sets. I am incredibly unhappy with this purchase!",1366588800,5,719,4.538461538461538

I immediately stopped to checked the disc, and I was horrified to find it completely scratched up. I am extremely upset about this because now I can't use it!

4218441,5,B003XM707S,"This set will contain all three seasons of the original Scooby-Doo series, universally referred to as Scooby-Doo Where Are You? (despite the fact that the third season was officially titled The Scooby-Doo Show).

This show is a part of many people's childhood regardless of what generation they are apart of. Originally airing in 1969 it became a classic and that's why even as a child growing up in the nineties I remember watching this series every morning almost religiously. It became so loved that its various incarnations have continued to air from 1969 to this very day in 2012. It also spawned three live action movies and countless animated movies. All that aside, Scooby-Doo Where Are You? is where it all began and what some (myself included) regard as the best. The atmosphere was dark and spooky, the characters were simplistic but well defined and the monsters were still fresh, as were the mysteries.

This new complete series set, is being put out for those who didn't get a chance to pick up the original Mystery Machine Collector's Edition set during its limited edition run. Like that set this one contains three seasons of Scooby Doo, 41 episodes in total spread across 7 discs. It is not technically complete as it is missing 8 episodes (the same as that set was), but it does carry over all the special features from that set.

This set will contain all the special features released on the two individual sets AND an eighth disc that was included in the previous complete series set.

Previously Released Special Features Included In This Set:

*Featurette: Scooby-Doo's Ultimate Fans
*Get the Picture: How to draw Scooby and the gang
*Funky Fashions
*Music Video: America Loves Scooby-Doo
*Scooby-Doo Street Smarts
*Scooby Challenge Trivia
*Hannah Barbera from H to B

Special Features Exclusive To This Set (and the previous limited edition release):

*Scooby-Doo The Whole World Loves You: Focuses on Scooby's continued popularity and fans continued love of the character. Features interviews with various writers, directors and actors who have worked on Scooby TV and Movie projects over the last 40 years. (20 mins)

*The Eerie Mystery of the Scooby-Doo History: The executives and creative team behind the show discuss how it originally came to be from their point of view. (10 mins)

*The Scooby-Doo Gang, In Their Own Words: Featurette focusing on the original voice cast of Scooby-Doo and how they originated the characters' unique voices. (5 mins)

The best reason for fans to buy this complete series set, aside from the eighth disc and its bonus materials, is the unique packaging. It may not be the mystery machine of the previous set but it still looks unique and stands out better than the two individual volumes on there own (I personally strongly dislike the slim packaging one gets buying the third season/2nd volume on its own). If you haven't bought the series this is a great opportunity to get the three seasons in one set. Hope this was helpful, I'll update if I learn more, Scooby-Dooby-Doo!!!",1348099200,158,4274,4.6301188903566715
4218442,4,B003XM707S,"I work with the MR/DD community, and one specific client has to watch Scooby-Doo when he gets home from work everyday.  Our cable provider used to provide Scooby On-Demand, but over the last two months, have done away with it.  It was heart-breaking to see his facial expressions everyday when he realized he could no longer watch his beloved show.  Then one day, I was on-line and happened to come across an advertisement for Scooby products.  Naturally, I clicked, saw the Mystery Machine and just knew I had to get this for him.  I don't know what he enjoys more... looking at the Mystery Machine on his shelf (next to his chair) or getting to watch Scooby once again, but all I do know is, I have NEVER seen him so happy.  The look of pure ecstasy on his face is enough to make even the worse day imaginable, just a little more tolerable.  Definitely worth the money and investment, in my opinion!!!!!!!",1347321600,9,907,4.52760736196319

These are super high quality DVDs, and the Mystery Machine dvd holder is the cutest. Since they have taken our Scooby off on demand, we were afraid he would rarely get to see his beloved Scooby. But thanks to these dvds, Scooby lives on in our house, and we can watch him and the gang for years to come.",1306281600,,598,3.9098360655737703
4218461,3,B003XM707S,"The product came just as described and price was good. Only complaint would be about the product - the van broke within 2 weeks of having because it snapped in an area, poorly made. Just keep the DVDs up in my DVD collection area, but the van had to get thrown out.",1305763200,,265,4.115384615384615
4218462,5,B003XM707S,Excellent product! It's really nice to have all the episodes in on place. The Mystery Machine holder is a unique and keeps the disks safe. The only suggestion would have is to make the plastic outer box firmer so it could be used as a display case. The decor on the outer box it completely fitting to the series. Excellent gift for Scooby Doo lovers of all ages!!,1303084800,,363,4.352941176470588
4218463,5,B003XM707S,"We've thoroughly enjoyed this collection!  Our kids beg to watch and we don't mind one bit--it's fun to revisit those memories of after school TV and they're good, clean shows.  I highly recommend this collection.",1302134400,,213,5.057142857142857
4218464,5,B003XM707S,"Great for any Scooby Doo fan. The only downfall is the flimsy cardboard that holds the DVD's. The DVD's were shoved in them very tightly when I got the item. I was afraid that I would rip the cardboard or worse, scratch the DVD's when trying to get them out. The Mystery Machine holder looks great.",1298332800,,298,4.339285714285714
4218465,5,B003XM707S,"If you are a Scooby-Doo fan, like me, this is a must buy. The Mystery Machine is a beautiful collector's item and looks very good in the shelf.

4218487,5,B003XM707S,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AND TWINS FOR CHRISTMAS. MY SON LOVES SCOOBY DOO AND WANTS TO WATCH HIM ALL THE TIME.

4218488,5,B003XM707S,"This was a christmas present for a huge scooby fan, and it was very well received.  what better than a mystery machine box set. I believe that there was no Scrappy Doo included( the most loathed character in cartoon history). so it is very worth it!",1294531200,,249,4.413043478260869
4218489,5,B003XM707S,"This item was definitely worth the cost. It is an awesome collection that the whole family can enjoy. The storage unit for the discs (the Mystery Machine) is sweet and it rolls, which makes it fun to play with also. If you are a Scooby fan I suggest you buy this set :)",1294099200,,269,4.09433962264151
4218490,4,B003XM707S,"I love the original Scooby Doo episodes! Theyt are amazing and none of the later ones are as good! I love this little van that comes with Scooby & Shaggy! I think the extras are fun and cute for little kids and that this Complete Series is good. However, as other reviewers have noted, I notice that about 8 episodes are missing. I wish they weren't because they are great episodes but overall this was an awesome buy and totally worth it!",1293494400,,439,4.365853658536586
4218491,2,B003XM707S,"We LOVE these old episodes, but the transfer quality is terrible. In fact, our Scooby VHS tapes look better on our high-def system than these DVDs! It seems as though tapes were played on a standard-def TV and recorded onto the DVDs with a camcorder aimed at the monitor. Motion gives legs a ""looking-through-a-screen-door"" appearance; this loses the charm of, what had been, smooth hand-drawn images. What a shame.",1293235200,16,415,5.028985507246377
4218492,4,B003XM707S,"Recently I had the chance to pick up Scooby Doo! Where Are You: The Complete Series on DVD. Is it worth double dipping on a set I'm sure most of us fans of Scooby probably already have? Well, yes and no. Scooby Doo! Where Are You: The Complete Series is a awasome yet equally flawed set, with the discs coming in filmsy plastic sleeves and the so called ""new"" bonus disc not being completely new.

Scooby Doo! Where Are You: The Complete Series comes with eight discs. The three seasons are spread over the first seven. These are the exact same discs that have been released before, except for Season 3, which is now three single sided DVDs instead of one single sided and one double sided DVD. What is there to be said about these episodes? These are the best of the best, the originals. In my opinion, some of the best Scooby episodes are from the first two seasons. Even season 3, even though it's techincally The Scooby Doo Show and not part of Scooby Doo! Where Are You, is pretty good. The eighth bonus disc comes with three new featurettes. ""The Eerie Mystery of the Scooby-Doo History"" focuses on the history of the show and how it went from ""Mysterys Five"" to the Scooby Doo we know and love today. ""The Scooby-Doo Gang, In Their Own Words"" all about the original voice actors and how they came up with the voices for their characters. These two featurettes are nice and all, but they are not techinally new. Both of these are from the Scooby Doo/Dynomutt Hour: Complete Series set. It seems to me that Warners was just to produce any more new material, and just dumped these on here. ""Scooby-Doo The Whole World Loves You"" is the only new bonus material here, and is the best out of the three. This featurette features people involved with various Scooby projects talking about the popularity of the character amd why Scooby has survived for over forty plus years.

Now, the reason to buy this set is, of course, the packaging. The Mystery Machine is really cool looking, especally on the shelf. And one of the best things about it is that it can double as a toy. The wheels move and everything{though you can't remove the two Scooby and Shaggy figures]. The back opens up to reveal the eight discs in plastic sleeves, which is the only downside to the packaging. The sleeves the discs come in are HORRIBLE. Very flimsy and cheap. I felt like they were going to fall apart on me when I took the discs out.

Yeah, I wish WB hadn't skimped out on the extras, and wish the discs came in something more sturdy, but I think the good outweighs the bad with this set. The packaging is awasome and the one new featurette is at least woth a look. If you're looking for a gift for someone or even if you already have the previous release, I strongly reccomend this set.

These episodes are essential because they introduced us to Scooby's cousins Scooby Dum and Scooby Dee. Warner needs to do a Season 4 and add these great episodes to it.
