4189665,5,B003SS2QQM,"This DVD ranks as one of my top two DVD's. In typical Rieu fashion, you are taken on a journey to a land that many people around the world will never be able to visit. This DVD is exceptional in that the bonus DVD shows the personal and human side of the people who make up this phenomenon. You are witness to the bond of love and commitment which binds these people together, and how they exist as one family unit. One will also witness the love and devotion, unabashedly felt, and naturally displayed daily, between a father (Andre') and his son (Pierre), and how they work with, not only their touring family, but with the local citizens of the location they are visiting/performing in. You will see how complicated and complex it is to set up these concert venues, and how hard and long the crews work to bring the Rieu vision and performance to the audience. You are witness to the adversities such as weather, a countries rules/regulations, and even the local residents habits and attidues, and how they can cause something you have no control over to go south very quickly.  If you are debating which Rieu product to give or get, this is the one that will take you on the journey of a life time, and into the very heart of a real life gift to the world.",1397779200,2,1260,4.407725321888412

4189670,4,B003SS2QQM,The concert Andre Rieu Live in Sydney is quite different from his other concerts. He always delivers a masterful presentation of classical music along with songs popular with the local culture. This dvd offers a local comedic performer which leaves me baffled and somewhat confused in trying to determine if this act belongs in this sort of venue. His concert Live in Australia(Melbourne) is a better choice and more elaborate production.,1349222400,,438,5.183098591549296
