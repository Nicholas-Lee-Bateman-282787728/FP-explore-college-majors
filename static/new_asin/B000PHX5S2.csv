8191477,5,B000PHX5S2,"Excellent choice of the 3 specific movies included in this DVD item. Watched Serpico for the first time...& loved the closeness of how they followed the true story of Detective Serpico. Also...it helped put a jacket with the reference made by John Travolta in ""Get Shorty"" when he was providing a discription of his stolen jacket at the coat-check...which scene took place within first 15 min of movie.",1478649600,,402,4.926470588235294

8191479,4,B000PHX5S2,Pretty good movies. Serpico was an excellent retelling of real police corruption that happened at NYPD. I had already seen the other two movies.,1380672000,,144,5.041666666666667
8191480,5,B000PHX5S2,This is the second time I buy a triple feature DVD. The concept is great. The consumer gets three great movies for the price of one. My first purchase of a triple feature DVD was the Beverlyhills Cop trilogy.,1282521600,3,208,4.358974358974359
8191481,5,B000PHX5S2,"Both ""Serpico"" and ""Narc"" are classics
of the modern American urban police
drama.
In addition, Serpico is based
on a true story.

The acting is excellent.
Great roles for Al Pacino,
Ray Liotta, and Jason Patric.

I have not seen Internal Affairs,
but the other two alone make this
an excellent triple feature to acquire.

note bene: If you are a reader,
the book ""Serpico"" by Peter Maas
that the film is based on is
excellent.",1266019200,3,426,4.578947368421052
8191482,4,B000PHX5S2,Three hard-hitting cop movies for the price of one.  How could you go wrong?,1261526400,3,76,4.428571428571429
