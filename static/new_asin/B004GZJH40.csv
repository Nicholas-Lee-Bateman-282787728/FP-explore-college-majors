4374376,5,B004GZJH40,"This movie is by far the best of the three Yogi Bear movies made for the Hanna-Barbera Superstar 10 collection.  The classic voice artists are all present to voice the classic characters one more time.  Julie Bennett is on hand as Cindy Bear, just as in the TV series and the 60's feature film ""Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!""  Don Messick portrays Yogi's sidekick Boo Boo as well as Ranger Smith.  And the one and only Daws Butler plays the part of Yogi Bear!  All of them are in very good voice for this film.

The somewhat complex plot involves Yogi and Boo Boo being ""bear-napped"" right out of Jellystone Park by a pair of delightfully zany space aliens named Zor One and Zor Two.  Meanwhile, Cindy Bear is going out of her mind searching for the missing Yogi and is finally forced to seek advice from Mountain Bear.  Yogi and Boo Boo discover a fiendish plot to take over Jellystone Park with duplicate Yogis and Boo Boos.  And to top it all off, Boo Boo even finds a love interest of his own, a space bear named Snoo Loo from a distant planet!

This cartoon movie is a laugh a minute.  It throws the characters into a series of bizarre out-of-this-world situations but at the same time keeps most of the story firmly rooted in Jellystone Park.  It's hip and corny at the same time, with something for all ages.  Yogi Bear really (literally) blasts off in this one!",1302825600,3,1366,4.416
