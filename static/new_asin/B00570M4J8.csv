8460122,5,B00570M4J8,"What every doctor should be prescribing. From the 1950s, Jack LaLanne comes into your home for five, twenty minute, weekly workout sessions per DVD. Although some of the nutrition and exercise information is a little outdated, Jack was right on the mark with his theory of the importance of exercising every day.  My favorite exercise from this 10-DVD series is standing on your toes, arms straight up in the air, then lifting one leg a foot or so off the ground and holding it for 15 to 30 seconds.  Spend 10 weeks with Jack and you'll never look back!",1422057600,5,553,4.575757575757576

8460124,5,B00570M4J8,"My family wanted something we could all do together. We also wanted something that had music that was not the typical Jazz/Rock/Pop. Jack has stood the test of time for his balanced approach. What was a surprise was his positive and infectious attitude. We are all enjoyng rainy day workouts with Jack, including the children. PS If you think it is too easy a workout. I was sore after the first day.",1413417600,3,400,4.569444444444445
