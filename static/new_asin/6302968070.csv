As with the Willis/Wayans effort, this one lacks  necessary chemistry between its two leads. Also, Bubba Smith amply proves that as an actor he's a great football player-- yet it's a toss as to who's the biggest on-screen stiff: Bubba or Beau Bridges.

Star/director Bridges strangely hired dad Lloyd to play the main villain. At one point Beau actually hocks a lunger on the old man. Now *there's* one for the shrink!

Here, Bridges is an FBI agent assigned to work with a narc cop. Their animosity toward each other is stiflingly dull and so is Bubba's home life with his yellow kitty cat. Your patient viewer sat through this endless tedium in anticipation of an action sequence payoff. Although all the requisite explosions, fires and machine gun bursts were there, this climactic scene fell as flat as the rest of the picture.

Don't waste your time on this one!

8216457,2,6302968070,"Bridges and Smith are mismatched as a pair of city cops who stumble onto a plan of mayhem hatched by a hate group.  This film is a hodgepodge of action/adventure, buddy movie, social commentary and comedy.  None of these elements work well together in this film.  Bridges' father gives a good performance as the head of the hate group, though.  Also watch for two of Bridges' kids in small roles.",1007683200,,396,4.614285714285714
