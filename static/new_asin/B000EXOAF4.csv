8115555,4,B000EXOAF4,"I gotta say its sad to finally finish this series. This volume probably had the most action and intrigue of them all, leaving me on the edge of my seat. The way the story led up to the final episode was really good with Gram, Vestimona, and Enora, and who doesnt like a good old fashioned rescue! That being said, even though the last episode wasn't really wrong or anything, I guess I expected a little more. The writers kinda left the god stones kinda vague, which I thought hurt the ending. I know they will help out the people of mars, but I wish we could have seen or been told in more specific ways. Anyway, maybe thats me being a perfectionist. Even so, the return of Yagami was good and I was happy he then stayed with the ship of Aurora. Gram getting his own ship was cool too especially being that it was the same ship that he and Vestimona were on when they came to terms with their relationship. The pirates of Aurora push on, getting into more adventures together. Gram and Vestimona shove off with their whole lives together. After going through so much adversity, volume 6 ends with everyone doing what they love and being with who they love and I believe this last volume shows us the real treasure to be sought after is that.",1171497600,3,1242,4.357758620689655
