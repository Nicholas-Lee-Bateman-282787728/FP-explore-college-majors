770286,2,6304077939,"I agree with the reviewer from Sillicon Valley. Sure this movie starts out with a few funny scenes, but it just gets more and more depressing as it goes along. Mental illness, and familial abuse,is just not amusing for a two hour movie. And for cat lovers don't watch this video ! there is a cat rape scene and the cat is realy suffering in this scene, it doesn't look faked. The cat is panting and terrified. But, the boy in the film is very sensative and overly intelligent for his mentally ill family. And there is no clear reason why he is commited to the nut house like the rest of his family, just becuase his mother finds him in a pool of vomit?",1037404800,11,652,4.224
770287,5,6304077939,"This film, about a boy in French-Canada growing up in a family with twisted chromosomes, is stunning.  The writing is beautiful, and the cinematography is both original and extraordinary.  The movie's use of the soundtrack is both inventive and emotionally effective.  I usually get offended by the use of emotional cue music, but in this case I'm feeling too much to notice.  I have watched this movie at least 30 times, and I am still catching elements that I missed.  This is extraordinarily hard to find, but it is well worth the effort.  There is some disturbing imagery, but the reward is very high.",988761600,7,605,4.769230769230769
770288,5,6304077939,"Leo, a precocious child growing up in abject poverty, concocts an alternative identity as an Italian boy (Leolo) conceived through an encounter between his mother and a tomato, freshly doused with the  onanistic spritz of an immigrant grocer. Surrounded by a (sur)real family--  a father obsessed with defecation, a sister who reigns as queen of the  insects in the crawl-space below the family's tenament apartment, a bullied  brother hiding from his environment in a steroid-enhanced body-- Leo(lo)  excapes into the fiction of his alternative life, aided by a kind stranger  who deposits books at his door-step.  At night Leo reads these fantastic  stories by stolen-light, and later they seep into his dreams, where he is  enthralled and inspired by the beauty of an older neighbor-girl he fancies  his muse and future lover.  ""Because I dream, I am..."" Leolo  reiterates throughout this bitter-sweet tale of a bright mind besieged by  the inequities of life.  While punctuated with hilarious episodes of  mock-heroism, and scored by a delightful Tom Waits soundtrack, the film  subtly reveals the brutalities that imperil Leo's comming of age.  While we  hope, with the protagonist, that art can triumph over the hardships of  life, the film refuses the sadder-but-wiser narratives of redemption that  usually underpin this genre.  The innoscence and wisdom of a child's  perspective is relayed in all of its precariousness.  If you liked ""My  Life as a Dog,"" ""400 Blows,"" or ""Slingshot,"" this  film will blow you away!  More bitter than sweet, ""Leolo"" is a  comming of age story that dares to question the faith we put in the  creative individual to convert our collective social failures into the  necessary conditions of art.  In doing so, it eloquently evokes the beauty  and the danger born of an impulse to fight with no recourse but mental  flight.  ""Leolo"" employs the conventions of magic realism while  staying firmly within a recognizable universe.  And while it crafts its  characters with humor it neither patronizes nor lampoons them.  The film's  true brilliance is its ability to convey the devastating limitations  imposed upon its young hero by an unfortunate and uncomprehending family,  while all along betraying their plight as similarly epic and  heart-wrenching.  ""Leolo"" will haunt you long after you turn off  the VCR.",945302400,40,2348,5.198924731182796
770289,5,6304077939,"An extraordinary black comedy set in Montreal.  Leolo (a manufactured name) is a just slightly pre-pubescent boy who claims that only his dreams are sane and that he is the product of a very offbeat conception between an  imported tomato and his mother. Trying to find his own reality, the main  character narrates us into a surrealistic and somehow disturbing but yet  very funny working of this his mind.  As the young man begins to experience  his own sexuality, we begin to see bits of reference to Phillip Roth's  Portnoy's Complaint and with a film style which pays deference to Louis  Malle's works, we become transported into a richly woven fabric of life in  the blue collar neighborhood of Montreal. Beautifully acted, with a very  good film score and the characteristic high quality of the ""National  Film Board of Canada"" releases, Leolo is highly recommended to those  who enjoy black comedy and fine cinema.

770391,5,6304077939,"This is an amazing film about a bright boy trying to survive  within an abusive and insensitive family. He fantasizes of living in a idyllic place with a girl who he loves, and writes about himself, his circumstances, and his fantasies. This is a deeply sad movie with black humor throughout.. The ending represents what happens emotionally, as well as physically to children where there is not one person who tries to protect him, or encourage him in his creative and sensitive writing.",1425081600,4,487,4.867469879518072

770394,5,6304077939,"I saw this movie years ago and to this date it has stayed with me.  I've only seen it once and everything about this movie was just so fascinating.  Leolo is a 12 year old boy who believes he is the result of sperm left on tomatoes and his mother falling in those tomatoes.  This is the beginning and it sets you up for how someone can be out of their mind and not know it.  His mean-spirited grandfather is just as insane... I am sorry, but I am writing this from my memory of at least 20 years ago. He is just starting to notice girls and spies on his next door neighbor.
But everything is told from Leolo's point of view.  And his point of view is wrapped in the blanket of insanity.  Maybe I like it so much because I was living overseas and I really got to understand foreign films.  This movie isn't afraid to explore some dark areas and it does have humor in it, but don't get me wrong, this movie is not a happy one.",1367366400,,924,4.043956043956044
770395,5,6304077939,"I saw this movie years ago and it's always been a favorite of mine.  Was happy to loacte it on Amazon.  It's full of surprises, some shocking, a movie you won't forget and will want to see over and over again.

770396,2,6304077939,"So what did we learn from this film?
That there are some surprising uses for a piece of raw liver.
That we should beware of Grandfather.
That fear can be something so deep within us that no stratagems can conquer it.
That there are really stoopid people who fish in the most polluted river imaginable. Yes, the St Lawrence and Rivire des Prairies are kinda bad but when I lived for nine years in Montreal, I never saw anything like the one in the movie.
That it's not good for parents to have weird obsessions, it tends to create problems in the children - especially if the children share an inherited tendency towards mental disorder.
That unlike the US, Canada takes care of disturbed people without bankrupting them or throwing them out in the street. (But we knew that).
That filmmakers can make a truly bizarre movie which *seems* to hang on a theme  (if you can find it) and get a lot of praise from those who enjoy being grossed out.

Two stars for sheer wacky originality and good filmcraft, but no more because of its incoherence.",1239926400,6,1040,4.526595744680851
770397,4,6304077939,"NOTICED THAT A REVIEW THAT WAS MADE ON LEOLO FROM THE NEW YORKER, MENTIONED A SCENE WHERE THERE WAS A RAPE OF A CAT.

I SAW THE MOVIE LEOLO SEVERAL TIMES, BUT I BELIEVE THE NEW YORKER MAY HAVE MADE A GROSS MISTAKE.  PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG?

FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, IVE BEEN TRYING TO REMEMBER A TITLE OF ANOTHER ""COMING OF AGE"" FOREIGN FILM, OF WHICH THERE WAS ANOTHER TEENAGER, THIS ONE SLIGHTLY OLDER THAN LEOLO.  IN THE MOVIE, THERE WERE TWO SCENES.  ONE OF TWO SMALL BOYS BEING YANKED BY THIS HEAVY SET GIRL UNDER A DEMOLISHED HOME, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE MOVIE LEOLO, BUT THE OTHER SCENE, IM ALMOST SURE WAS IN ANOTHER MOVIE.  THIS IS WHERE THE TEENAGER WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR LEANING AGAINST A WALL, WHILE TWO DRUNK TEENAGERS WERE HOLDING DOWN A CAT, AFTER EVERYONE HAD MADE A BET, THAT ANOTHER TEENAGER WOULD NOT HAVE SEX WITH THE CAT.

DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THIS MOVIE?  IF SO, WHAT IS THE NAME.  I DONT BELIEVE THESE TWO SCENES I JUST MENTIONED WERE IN LEOLO.",1222646400,,977,4.295081967213115
770398,5,6304077939,"WOW! What a great movie. It is tastefully created from all of the aspects. There is great scenery and camera work, wonderful soundtrack and great acting by a group of obviously very talented people. And there's this ongoing transition between fantasy and reality that are blended together in such a way that it is sometimes hard to distinguish which one is which. In addition, this movie is a fine example of how smart and sometimes cruel children are. Now a few bad things. I did not like how the movie ended, but I guess the movie wouldn't be as good as it was without a major sacrifice, which was also a great point of this movie. The cat scene is somewhat upsetting, considering that I am a cat person. But, again it was the necessary part and I wouldn't take it away. You want a raw reality of the things that are out there? Then accept what was in the movie. Otherwise, what's the point of owning this movie? This movie is one of those dark comedy motion pictures that have a message, a lesson and entertainment all in one package.

Now about DVD. First thing that I want to say is subtitle translation is new and not the same as on VHS. So this new translation is terrible. I don't speak French but, a lot of language is very obviously incorrect. Sometimes there may be situations that called for paraphrase, rather than exact translations, and that wasn't done either. Also, there are no extra features at all. The only thing that is present is movie trailer. A good thing is that there is a DTS sound available.

ONE MORE Inconsistency is that French DVD has 115 minutes and American has only 106. I wonder why.",1148601600,8,1620,4.469594594594595
770399,5,6304077939,"I saw this movie when I was in my early twinty's, the way Lolo grew up, is one of the ways you can grew up where I was born here in Belgium. Thats why I like the movie, a simalar movie in that genre is ""Wait Until Spring Bandini"", it's from a Belgian director, but the cast is half American and half Italian. So if you like Lolo you will like that movie to.",1138579200,3,357,3.8378378378378377
770465,2,6304077939,"I strongly disagree with the positive reviews on this site and with the people who list Leolo as one of the best movies ever made.  I found it to be depressing and pointless.  It is not enough to keep saying I dream, I dream, I dream.  The hell with that.  It is artsy nonsense as it leads us from one depressing scene to another.  This film, and the reaction to it, shows me that if you say something very trite over and over again, and wallow in mud for two hours, there will be a lot of people wallowing with you and praising your artistry.

You have the older brother of Leolo, the cowardly older brother who lifts weights to gain a very impressive physique, and then backs down and cries once again when his childhood bully bullies him once again.

You have the insane grandfather who tries to drown Leolo for splashing in the pool, and the reverse scene where Leolo tries to hang his grandfather with a noose.  What idiocy.

You have no end of filth, excrement and squalor.  You have sexuality turned filthy.  If that's your idea of art, I really have to question your taste.

I'm not objecting to the filth.  I'm objecting to the emptiness, the lack of artistry, the substitution of filth for art.  If you think filth alone, misery alone, are valuable works of art, you will love this one.

However, it makes no sense at all, and is full of trite nonsense about I dream, I dream, whatever.  It is high art for the tasteless.",1137888000,14,1431,4.38403041825095
770466,1,6304077939,"The only useful comment I have found on this section is the one of the viewer who smashed the tape after the cat scene.

Without that scene, the movie would just be a boring and meaningless string of unconnected episodes, with no use other of entertaining a bunch of intellectuals who dwelve on terms such as ""poetic"", ""beautiful"" and ""troubled genius"".

Then you reach the scene of the cat, which makes blood boil (at least of any person who has a bit of humanity).

I would like to tell the reader who intelligently comments on ""Philistines who watch art film and then get all self-righteous about the gritty bits"" that I prefer to be a Philistine than a stuck up, posh intellectual who confuses torture with art. Probably next time I'll rent Disney, be sure it won't be Lauzon. I will steer clear of any movie that you will regard as ""wonderful"".",1121990400,16,849,4.572368421052632
770467,5,6304077939,"Leolo tells the story of a young boy living in a slum. He writes in a notebook scenes of his own bizarre family life plagued with sadness, his father's scatological obsessions, his mother's unconditional love for him and his sibling's slow but inevitable descent into madness, he falls in love with a beautiful girl that does dirty favors for his lecherous grandfather, so he decides to murder him and fails.

Each page he writes, he rips off from the notebook and throws it away. A junk-collector, to whom Leo refers as the ""Verse Tamer"" (the one who gave him his first and only book, that is used as a prop for a short table leg and that he reads in secret in the middle of the night) picks up these wrinkled pages and collects them, being the only one to realize the strength and beauty of the boy's prose.

As time goes by, Leolo begins to slip, having failed at grasping a scrap of reason in his sad life.

Leolo is a beautiful movie, photography and music blending well to wrap a heartbreaking story of dreams unborn.",1120867200,6,1023,4.459893048128342
770468,5,6304077939,"Leolo is a masterpiece in filmmaking-a dreamlike coming of age story that echoes David Lynch and Federico Felllini, and even predates Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Dark, weird, and, yes, disturbing, Leolo is the story of an imaginative young French-Canadian who believes himself conceived by his mother's clumsy meeting with a tomato.

I have been waiting for this film on DVD since the format's invention having seen it in an art house in 1992. Also since 1992, I had been waiting expectantly and hopefully for Jean-Claude Lauzon to make another film. Tragically, Lauzon died in a plane crash in 1997 while preparing his third film.",1118188800,8,623,5.107843137254902
770469,3,6304077939,"This film has a few comic moments but it  has a very dark theme that in no way relates to a normal coming of age film.  It is powerful and is a work of art but the director makes his mark on us by crossing many lines, making a film that frankly could not be shown in any public theater I know of.  It is a work of despair.  Heavy use of symbols to code whether something is actual or imagined.  The main theme is the harm done to childhood both by the social environment and by genetic and abuse-caused brain damage.  There are scenes of both child and animal abuse.

This is the second and last film from this director, who died in a small plane crash soon after this film was finished.",1108771200,,687,4.082089552238806
770470,5,6304077939,"Jean-Claude Lauzon was, no doubt, a troubled genius. I have seen Leolo many times and also the documentary about its director titled Lauzon Lauzon.

Leolo is a work of art. Lauzon attacked this project like a composer attacks a symphony. Its said that he played tapes of the musical scores for the producer, while standing over his shoulder and demanding that he read the script immediately.

Lauzon used music like a knife to make his points in some scenes. We hear the sacred tones of classical hymn while we see the gritty sometimes profane reality that Leolo lives in. There is Catholic symbolism and guilt oozing out of this film. The voice who speaks to us off an on throughout the film is excellent; through the voice of the archivist, of Leolo's

papers and deepest thoughts, we are allowed access to his psyche. The voice is also in English on the DVD.

Maxime Collin is an incredible young actor. He plays Leo who refuses to be a french Canadian boy from the poorest part of Montreal and instead he is Leolo a white shirted Italian boy who lives for romance and beauty (oh yes and the Italian Countryside is beautiful). Our main charter repeats over and over, ""I think therefore I am not"". There is a lot here that Leolo would ""not"" want to be. Crazy for starters as his family home is a bit of an asylum.

If you're squeamish, steer away, there are gritty scenes here. Yes a cat gets defiled (among other things), but for the prudish reviewer who claimed he smashed his tape at this point, I really doubt that the cat was hurt. Kinda of like the horses didn't really die in Brave Heart, my friend! Look beyond the cat to the social statement that is being made about the boy who is involved. Remember his mother worries that he is smoking, but has no idea what she ought to be worrying

about. I won't say anymore, spoilers annoy me almost as much as Philistines who watch art film and then get all self-righteous about the gritty bits. (Hint, rent Disney instead, my friend)

This is an art film there is no other way to describe it. It is a comedy but it's a dark art comedy so don't buy it for a laugh out loud evening, there are some really heavy and troubling elements here that will leave you thinking afterwards.

The movie is beautifully filmed and well worth purchasing. I note that the DVD is only available through Amazon.ca, at the US site they are only selling the VHS. Buy the DVD, invite over a good friend, open some wine and enjoy the film and the long conversation that will follow it.",1098230400,19,2514,4.461873638344227

770472,4,6304077939,"Do not believe the boxcover that portrays this as a delightful comedy about sexual curiosity!  Leolo is much darker than that.
Here we find a gritty life through the eyes of a youngster who happens to be a bit of a magical realist.  Some moments are witty, such as the imagined story of his conception while others are downright awkward and painful.
  What I liked best about the movie were the several thematic areas it covered in a symbolic and mythical fashion.  It addresses an individual's and family's psychological disintegration, the status of the urban underclass, & sexuality. It also portrays the boy, leolo, as a sort of magical escapist messiah for his hopeless family.
  Leolo also happens to be one of only two films I have seen where a piece of raw liver is violated. (warning for the squeemish)  If you are in any way prudish, do avoid this film.
  In summary, this is an excellent & deep film for viewing with friends if you care to stimulate a strong discussion.",1088553600,6,981,4.651162790697675

770474,5,6304077939,"Leolo
This is a dark comedy that has much in common with the wonderful French film by Patrice LeConte entitled The Hairdresser's Husband.  Certainly the two films are in the same genre. The film is a backwards and forwards look at the life of a gifted young lad named Leo, unlucky enough to be born a Silk Purse in a family of Sow's Ears, to complete the metaphor.  Leo has the soul of a poet, and we hear his exquisite thoughts weaving the film together.  The voice-overs are in French, of course, which makes them even more beautiful.
Leo is a dreamer, and his story is about the importance of dreams, and of love.  The film is full of premonitions and gives many clues about events to come.  It's a journey into the agonies and longings and ordeals of coming-of-age, but it's also much more.  It's at times zany, playful, tragic, poetic, pensive, and thoughtful.  It's filled with contrasts: innocence and depravity, sweetness and brutality, melancholy and etheriality, images of beauty and squalor, picturesque, warm vistas of Sicily and the cold starkness of tenements in Canada, a loving family cavorting on a Sunday outing and the craziness existing within that same family, just to name a few.  The wonderful sensitivity and beautiful poetic quality of this film are exquisite to savor.  It is a film that takes its time to tell its story, and finding that wonderful quality in a film is a true delight.  So many films made in this country and in the world are compacted into staccato images that hit one's psyche like a machine gun.  This one lingers on the images it presents, and imparts its message in its own time, on its own terms, and in its own unique way.
This is a film that needs to be seen more than once.  It's complex and deep and wide-ranging and ambitious in scope.  It's full of many-sided emotions and it's about more than just what happens in the plot.  Purchase it, and savor it, and contemplate the wonderfully told story of a truly amazing life.  Highly, highly recommended!!",1057968000,24,2005,4.65625
