8049096,2,B0007N1JXM,"I have read these books years ago and have seen the movies on T.V.  The  Box I recieved was very poorly re-mastered to DVD, very poor quality other than that the movies are still excellent but the quality of sound and picture is poor. I have a new Sony DVD player and several others in my home so it is the quality of the re-mastering from T.V. or VHS to DVD

Sincerely Diana Gallant",1170115200,17,383,4.148648648648648
8049097,1,B0007N1JXM,"The recording quality was atrocious.  There were many skips, stops and whole segments missed.  I thought that the collection was to include Mistral's Daughter, but it was not included.  I had specifically asked for Mistral's Daughter.  I am in Baja Mexico, 600 miles below the border, for the winter, so I can't send the product back which I would have done if I had been in the states.  I will never order from Amazon.com again if I plan to watch the product later where I can't return it quickly.  Shyrl Bailey  Mulege, Mexico Baja Calif Sur",1167868800,15,543,4.59375
