1714087,5,B000067D1S,"I love the movie I rated it 5 stars because I think it is a very good movie. It is so funny and I love the people who are in it! If you don't like this movie you are crazy it is so good!! I think it shows that everyone has a dramatic/sweet side, it is an awsome movie!!",1055289600,2,269,3.5762711864406778
1714088,4,B000067D1S,"But the dvd gets only 3 from me, so it averages out to a 4 star release.  I was happy when I found out one of my favorite movies was coming out on dvd.  A story about overcoming differences; the white female coaching the young, black, inner-city basketball team.  There's tension in the beginning because they're unfamiliar with each other, but they learn to work together and end up finding success.  Yeah, it may seem like something you've seen before, yeah it may be predictable.  But so what?  That doesn't mean it's not good.  I think the movie did a good job of making the viewer care about and root for the characters, especially Fredro Starr's character, Shorty Dowop.  He showed that ruffnecks could be sensitive and have feelings as well as forties.  Basically, I love the movie, but the dvd is only in full screen, not wide screen.  It would have been nice to have a choice.  The only extras are trailers for Race The Sun, Higher Learning and Sunset Park.  A music video, filmographies or commentary would have been nice as well, but Columbia/Tristar's low frills dvd treatment prevents me from giving it a perfect score.",1026172800,6,1132,4.661616161616162
1714089,3,B000067D1S,"Like I said, it's a cute little movie.  I didn't think it stereotypical and I'm Black.  It wasn't the usual ""White person comes into the ghetto and saves the day"".  The Coach and the Kids all grew and helped each other.  It's a fun feel good flick; enjoy it for what it's worth.",979689600,4,278,4.188679245283019
1714090,1,B000067D1S,Fredro Starr is a good actor.in fact what ever happened to the group Onyx? but this film is cliched and Predictable. Rhea Perlman looks out of place.this is a 2nd tier Above The Rim.,950659200,,182,4.382352941176471

I have seen this movie for the first time on a tour bus.
...I got to have.
The characters are witty as they deal with the trials and tribulations surrounding high school basketball.
No dull moments...great script and acting.
Great early works of Terrance Howard and the supporting cast.",1286496000,,341,4.896551724137931
1714161,3,B000067D1S,"And you have Sunset Park. It's all about a crappy sports team that makes it to the top by using teamwork. However, this one doesn't just tackle the crappy sports team aspect. It's definitely better in terms of either directing, acting, and everything, that involves Emilio Estevez in the role of a coach. There's a few life lessons to be learned, watching this movie, but they're all ""Racism is bad, mmkay"". If you're looking to buy anything Mighty Ducks related (at least, movie-wise), don't bother and pick up Sunset Park. It's better.",1134777600,,537,4.8478260869565215

7962621,5,B000067D1S,"I'm a fan of any and everything 90's related because that's the era that I grew up in as an 80's baby, and I've learned to appreciate that era in the last couple years because a lot of the music and films of today leave a lot to be desired. With that being said, Sunset Park is one of my favorites and I feel it is severely underrated. I mean, when people talk about good movies from the 90's nobody even mentions this movie; it's like it doesn't even exist. If you like Above the Rim, Coach Carter, or Love and Basketball, give Sunset Park a try.",1484179200,,547,4.121495327102804
