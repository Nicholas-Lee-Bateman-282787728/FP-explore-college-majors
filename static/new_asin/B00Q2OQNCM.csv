WHICH BLU RAY VERSION IS FOR YOU?:  Major fans will have already hashed and rehashed this.  However, here is the very simple perspective.  If you want to see the program mainly as it aired, in Full Screen (older square-ish format), that is only in ""The Definitive Collection"" which has both Widescreen and Full Frame versions and includes the 1979 movie theater edit of the TV pilot episode called ""Saga of a Star World"" (slightly different edit with more final ending).  However, if you don't mind some slight cropping at top and bottom and you don't need the additional Theater edit of the pilot, then the cheaper&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Remastered-Collection/dp/B00Q2OQNEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Remastered Collection</a>&nbsp;is all you need. ***Note that though the Widescreen version has minor cropping top and bottom, it also gains some picture width on each side (not viewable in the original Full Frame) as they take advantage of overshoot on film stock to widen the frame. So it's a give and take either way.  ***More on the cropping below.*** ---Both sets include Galactica 1980

REVIEW INTRO: Shortly after Star Wars ushered in a new era of special effects, there was a rush to get new space sagas onto the small screen.  As a result, Battlestar Galactica is one of our great milestones in TV Sci Fi.  It was made in the 70's, so of course there's a little 70's acting shmultz.  But, the 70's bent is part of its charm in a way.  This show ages surprisingly well because of the quality of story and character development.  The mythology speaks to a deeper part of the human soul and captivates our imagination.  As a young boy, I was obsessed!

BASIC STORY (no spoilers):  From the pyramid skyscrapers of home world Caprica, to the undiscovered worlds of space,  this is one of our seminal tales of space saga.  --  Humans in a system of planets with twelve colonies have been enemies for a thousand years with a cybernetic race called Cylons.  These Cylons have now sued for peace and celebrations are planned throughout the planetary systems.  However, this peace accord is only a ruse (aided by the human traitor Baltar)  to mask an approaching invasion force bent on their annihilation.  The war vessel Battlestar Galactica catches the attack early and manages to survive the holocaust along with a ragtag fleet of 220+ civilian vessels filled with survivors from all twelve colonies.  Together they will travel throughout the universe in search of a fabled Thirteenth Colony on a planet called Earth.  This so they can bolster their numbers and survive as the human race.  They seem to be guided by the Lords of Kobol themselves and thwarted by a force darker than the Cylons.  Along the way, they will find countless worlds holding clues to where the Thirteenth Colony went many millennia ago.  They will also encounter many species and learn more of the Lords of Kobol, who are god-like and associated with the mother race for all humans.

CHARACTERS:  One of the things that make this show so durable are its outstanding characters.  Yes, the acting can be a little shmultzy, but that is normal for the 70's and a prime-time series viewed by a wider age group.  Loren Green leads the cast as the elder statesman and commander of the remaining Battlestar.  It is a tale of his family with son Apollo rising in his footsteps.  Starbuck is the lovable rake that everyone seems to love best despite his mischief.  Jane Seymour plays beautiful Serina, who becomes Apollo's love interest.  Lucifer is the envious and impetuous robot who plays second fiddle to the human traitor Baltar.  Sheeba is the kick butt female fighter pilot.  And of course, the now mythical cylons themselves with that monotone voice, eerie cyclops eye that burns red and waves from side to side with that warbling sound!

THE MYTHOLOGY:  The show has a very strong mythology borrowed from many ancient religions and cultures, as well as from some relatively new ones.  This is not a religious program and no one against that should be put off.  However, the use of these mythologies is brilliant because it speaks to such a primal part of the human consciousness.  The twelve colonies (tribes) are clearly Israelite inferences while Egyptian and Greek images and dress and architecture are copied immensely.  The Counsel of the Twelve - very Christian.  Still, it's done in a way to create structure and story.  It is wholesome for a family show, but not preachy in any way.  It is first and foremost Sci-Fi.

REMASTER AND BLU-RAY REVIEW:  Keep in mind this is all in context of a show over 35 years old so one can't expect it to be exactly like releases of new Sci-Fi.  This is also a remaster and not a full restoration and cleaning.  That said, this is a clear improvement over the older releases with crisper details and brighter colors that are still reasonably natural tone.  For a program with so many dark scenes on ship bridges or deep space, I actually felt lucky that the dark scenes still looked as good as they did.  Deep space shots of nebula (in special effects) can still look a little fuzzy but certainly better than before.  When actually looking at real objects even in dark scenes, there is way less grain than there could have been.  I still saw a little more grain looking at a few shots of Galactica from the outside in space, but it was not bad given the dark scene and the age of the film.  Luckily they didn't do too much DNR in my opinion and I can still see pores on people's faces if reasonably close.  I did notice there are still many small film artifacts and an occasional hair thin yellow streak now and then.  The artifacts are definitely on both Widescreen and Full Frame, but are more noticeable on the Widescreen version.  A few of the more harsh artifacts I saw on the Widescreen were not in the Full Frame version (again, frame by frame comparison), which was a little strange.  Also, the larger your TV, the more noticeable it will be.  The sound is also a great improvement and there is separation.  But again, it's an old source so it won't be just like a new Sci-Fi movie.  It's much better than before, but it's not going to be reference quality.  Overall I am very happy and breathing a sigh of relief.  I have seen much worse restorations that were from shows a decade later than this.  I have seen dark scenes in other movie restorations that look like bad VHS (not the case here).  It is also important to note that despite some obscure rumors, there is no CGI enhancement of special effects.

ABOUT THE CROPPING ON THE WIDESCREEN VERSION:  I ran frame by frame comparisons and there is cropping on the widescreen to get that length though they also take advantage of the overshoot on original film stock to get even more length and minimize the amount of cropping necessary top and bottom.  It's not  going to make a huge deal, but it could make a difference to more particular fans.  In really close scenes when viewing a pilot in the cockpit, the frame can cut off higher parts of the helmet design of the pilot.  When the camera pans to show screen readouts that the pilot see's, some detail might be cut off.  In one scene for example, I could see an entire freighter on the cockpit diagram in full screen mode, but in widescreen it cut a noticeable part of the bottom off.  Conversely, the width you gain in Widescreen from overshoot will show side details not in the Full Frame version.  The opening scene with the council around a table will show the outer wall layers creating a natural picture frame effect (you do see the whole room and characters though).  This would not be viewable in the original TV broadcast or the Full Frame version Blu Ray.  As I said, it's a trade off and a matter of personal preference.  I will post more on this later.  If you really prefer watching in widescreen and don't mind a little snipping top and bottom, the other package I mentioned is a cheaper option.

FINAL THOUGHTS: Though the special affects will seem dated to new viewers, they were part of that groundbreaking revolution in their day.  Be forgiving of the ticky-tac stuff and appreciate this show for the milestone and accomplishment that it was.  From the dark regions of space, the engaging mysticism, to the fighter jocks with gunslinger like laser pistols on their hips, this show has so many elements to entertain and captivate.",1417910400,175,9458,4.804213135068154
6853353,5,B00Q2OQNCM,"So, it's November 28, 2014 (the day after Thanksgiving) and it's about seven months from release date and even though *I HAVE* pre-ordered Battlestar Galactica: the Definitive Collection [Blu-ray] today (partially out of love for the series, partially out of spite for crybabies, partially due to the fact that I know it will probably be down to about $60 - $70 upon release), unlike the other folks who haven't even farted next to it nevertheless seen the product, I *don't* find myself particularly qualified to review the product.

That being said, lack of experience with the product doesn't seem to stop anyone else from posting their troll, 1-star reviews because they're hiney-hurt over the fact that Universal didn't make *exactly* the product they wanted while including a little note saying:

""Thank you for being one of 12 people on the planet that just absolutely has to have this set in 4:3 aspect ratio only.  It was obviously a smart decision to call you first.  We are so happy to be able to spend tens of millions of dollars to have our Mexican disc manufacturing plants bang this out just to make you happy.  In fact, we're so excited to do this that we've decided to actually have Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict come to your house to act out some of your favorite scenes.  We're also going to dig up the bodies of Lorne Greene and John Colicos and dress them in their original costumes to for added authenticity and don't worry... we haven't forgotten about you!  You get dress up like a Cylon for the re-enactment!

Love and kisses,

Universal Home Video""

^^^Because apparently, this is what some people expect.

Well, I don't.  I'm a realist.  I recognize the fact that Universal doesn't remaster a set like this to make an obnoxiously small niche happy, they do it to make a profit and part of that decision-making process includes choices that they feel will appeal to the most consumers based on their market research. But here's the funny thing: it doesn't even occur to JAllen in his troll, 1-star review of a product that he has no experience with that Universal, despite the fact that there is such a limited market for what he wants, put time and effort to make *EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS* available to him and his 11 disciples.  No, what he wants is for Universal to spend money to produce an ADDITIONAL set that no one would buy but him and his followers.

Sorry, but that's not going to happen and if you don't like it, don't buy it.  You have that option, but don't have a temper-tantrum in an effort to drive down the rating on a product that you have no personal experience with because you didn't get your way.

I'm giving this 5-stars to counteract JAllen's review.  I'll post an actual review of the product... *WHEN I RECEIVE IT.*",1417132800,45,2767,4.646817248459959
6853354,1,B00Q2OQNCM,"This is Pandora's box opening right here. We've only just managed to move from a world of home video in which all widescreen prints were panned and scanned (or worse, given a dead centre crop) to fit a 4:3 tv screen, and now they're cropping fullframe films top and bottom in order to fit the changeover to widescreen TVs. It was a disaster when they did it to Kung-fu and Route 66 and Hondo, and it's a disaster here, but they're attempting to get in front of the fallout by making the fullscreen prints available AS WELL -- but only at a higher price. Those warmly disposed toward the widescreen crops are naturally happy about there 'only' being a twenty dollar difference between the sets containing widescreen only and those containing both widescreen and fullframe, but consider the fact that the un-cropped original prints are basically being presented as enhancements to the basic set, which is widescreen, as a sop to the kind of pedants who get ticked off about silly things like original framing or the film makers' intent. Charging more for the original aspect ratio is going to lead a lot of people to settle for the widescreen, and in future the company will be able to point at the sales figures for the two sets and say, ""Look at that: we gave them a choice and most consumers bought widescreen."" And it'll be altered prints from then on. Casablanca and the Maltese Falcon are going to look GREAT in widescreen...

This would bother me more if I cared more about Galactica, but it's a slippery slope we're about to descend here. Why not widescreen only AND fullscreen only sets? Most people interested in the fullscreen aren't going to be interested in the wide, and, after all, the reformatting from full to widescreen is the process that cost the 'meticulous' and expensive man-hours, so why should those who prefer the un-tampered with originals pay the freight for the reformatting? Being required to purchase the 16:9 prints in order to get the 4:3 is like being made to buy the Special Editions of the original Star Wars trilogy again in order to get the untouched versions.",1416960000,45,2096,4.7111716621253406
6853355,5,B00Q2OQNCM,"I am seriously hoping it is a brand new remaster, as opposed to the grainy German, UK, Japanese and Australian issues. I'm thinking the movie will be DTS MA 1.1. The only thing missing is a DTS HD MA 1.1 version of Mission Galactica- the way it was meant to be heard. Looks like Universal 'tested the market' to see how popular the classic series is today, with the German and other releases. Furthermore, funds from the sales probably enabled a new, superior remaster. The fact it is not being released until May indicates it probably is a new remaster, for BOTH 1:33:1 and widescreen formats.",1416873600,8,594,4.613207547169812

6853379,5,B00Q2OQNCM,"2/22/2014 TO THE MOST BELOVED MAN OF MY LIFE WHO ENJOYED 1 OR 2 BRAND NEW EPISODES OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES (TOS) WITH ME HERE ON SAMISHBAY!  HAPPY 99TH BIRTHDAY GRANDPA!

THE EXCELLENT ORIGINAL SERIES (TOS) HAS BEEN PART OF MY LIFE SINCE I WAS A BOY. THE BACKSTORY ABOUT A CYBORG RACE THAT CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH 12 COLONIES OF HUMANITY WHEN THE HUMANS AIDED THE HASARIS AFTER THE CYLONS TRIED TO ENSLAVE THEM, WAS PERFECT AND MADE IT UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THE 1,000 YAHREN WAR WEARY HUMANS BEGAN THE SERIES WITH WHAT THEY BELIEVED WOULD BE A MEETING FOR PEACE WITH THE CYLONS, BUT IN ACTUALITY WAS A TRICK BY THE EVIL HUMAN BALTAR AND THE CYLONS TO GET THE HUMANS TO LEAVE THE COLONIES DEFENSELESS, SO THAT THE CYLONS COULD EXTERMINATE HUMANITY.
LUCKILY, COMMANDER ADAMA FORESAW THE DANGER AND SAVED THE GALACTICA AND MANY OF THE SURVIVORS OF THE ATTACK BY ORGANIZING A RAGTAG FUGITIVE FLEET AND WITHDRAWING TO TRY TO FIND HELP FROM THE LOST BROTHERS OF MAN FROM THE PLANET EARTH, KNOWN ONLY TO THEM THROUGH ANCIENT WRITINGS. BOTH SHOWS ARE EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY, EXCEPT THAT THE NEW SERIES CHANGED THE PERFECT BACKSTORY, MAKING THE HUMANS THE INVENTOR OF THE CYLONS, AND THE NEW SERIES MAKES THE GODS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL, AND LEAVES NO ROOM FOR ANY OTHER RELIGION WE KNOW SUCH AS JUDEO CHRISTIANITY TO EXIST. GODS SO AWFUL THAT ALL OF HUMANITY DECIDES TO FLEE KOBOL WHERE THESE SO CALLED GODS FOUGHT WITH EACH OTHER, AND THEY DID NOTHING TO HELP HUMANITY WHEN THE CYLONS DESTROYED THE COLONIES. IN FACT IT APPEARS THEY HELPED THE CYLONS AND GAVE THEM A ""SOUL."" IS IT ANY WONDER THAT THE HUMANS SHOW SUCH AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF SELF CENTEREDNESS? AND SUCH A LACK OF REGARD FOR BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS? THE WAY THEY TREAT THE HUMANIZED CYLON PRISONERS REMINDS ME OF HOW SOME OF OUR AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS IGNORE THE GOD GIVEN AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS. THE COLONIALS SHOULD BE OBSERVING ALL OF THEIR RIGHTS WHILE ENTRUSTING A DOCTOR WILKER TEAM TO DISABLE THE ""CHIP"" OR TRANSPONDER OR WHATEVER CAUSES THE HUMANIZED CYLONS TO LEAVE THEIR DOCILE ""SLEEPER"" STATE.
THE NEW COMMANDER ADAMA, NEARLY STARTS A CIVIL WAR NEAR THE END OF SEASON ONE. AND THEN AGAIN AFTER HIS SUPERIOR, COMMANDER CAIN ARRIVES. IF ADAMA WAS LIKE TOS ADAMA, HE WOULD HAVE AVOIDED THE FIRST SITUATION BY GOING TO COLONIAL ONE TO MEET IN PRIVATE WITH THE PRESIDENT. HE WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ALL HER REASONS, EVEN UNDERSTOOD AND SUPPORTED THEM, AND ALSO POINTED OUT THAT SHE NEVER AGAIN MAKE SUCH A ""END RUN"" AROUND HIM, BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT RESPONSIBLE LEADERS OF A RACE FIGHTING FOR ITS SURVIVAL MUST DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO REDUCE TENSION BETWEEN GROUPS OF THEIR PEOPLE AND THAT THE TRAGEDY OF CIVIL WAR COULD HAVE OCCURRED, WHICH WOULD LIKELY WEAKEN THE HUMANS TO THE POINT WHERE THE CYLONS WOULD BE ABLE TO DESTROY THEM.
WHEN COMMANDER CAIN ARRIVED, HE SHOULD HAVE TOLD HER THE SITUATION: ""I AM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT. THE PRESIDENT AND I HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE TO FIND THE LOST BROTHERS OF MAN ON EARTH IN ORDER TO SAVE HUMANITY. IF YOU ELECT TO JOIN US, I WILL BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS AND YOU WILL STILL BE IN CHARGE OF THOSE UNDER YOU. WHO IS PRESIDENT AND WHO IS COMMANDER IN CHIEF CAN CHANGE EVERY 4 YEARS THROUGH OUR NORMAL CONSTITUTIONAL ELECTION PROCESS.""
IF THE TOLERATION, EVEN THE CELEBRATION OF BATTLESTAR GALACTICA TOS's AND STAR TREK'S ""INFINITE DIVERSITY IN INFINITE COMBINATIONS"" HAD ALSO BEEN DONE HERE, THEN ADAMA WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE THE WISDOM AND MORAL CHARACTER THAT ALL GOOD LEADERS SUCH AS WW2 COMMANDER IN CHIEF DWIGHT DAVID EISENHOWER HAD. IF THE CREATORS OF THE NEW BATTLESTAR GALACTICA REMOVED THE FEW LINES THAT MADE MAN THE CREATOR OF CYLONS, AND THE OFFENSIVE ANTIRELIGION LINES ABOUT THE GODS OF KOBOL, THEN THE SHOW WOULD BE PERFECT, EVEN WITH ADAMA'S MISTAKES THAT COULD CAUSE CIVIL WAR.

1/23/2016 AFTERWORD
THE CANCELLATION OF THE EXCELLENT BATTLESTAR GALACTICA TOS IN 1979 WAS A TRAGEDY. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, LIKE SUPERMAN, STAR TREK, AND STAR WARS, PERFECTLY SHOWED US THE NATURE OF THE BATTLE OF GOOD VS EVIL. CONFIRMING THE TEACHINGS OF THE HOLY BIBLE THAT THERE ARE ABSOLUTES! ANY PEOPLE THAT REJECT THE HIGHER POWER OF GOD AND HIS COMMANDMENTS TO TREAT ALL OTHERS AS YOU WOULD WANT TO BE TREATED, REPRESENTED IN THIS SERIES BY THE SHIPS OF LIGHT INTRODUCED IN ""WAR OF THE GODS,"" AND THAT SUPPORT SATAN'S HATRED, GREED, AND DECEPTION, REPRESENTED BY THE EVIL COUNT IBLIS, HAVE NEVER NOR WILL EVER LAST. THEY WILL BE DESTROYED!
ALTHOUGH THE SHORTLIVED ""SECOND SEASON"" CALLED GALACTICA 1980 IS ENTERTAINING, IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT US LOVERS OF THE SHOW NEEDED A BETTER ENDING. SO AT THE TIME, I, STILL A BOY, WROTE A GREAT ENDING FOR MY PERSONAL ENJOYMENT!  I DIDN'T PUBLISH IT.
I WOULD SURE LOVE TO RESURRECT GALACTICA WITH THE EXACT SAME LOOK AND LOOKALIKE ACTORS TO TAKE UP RIGHT WHERE THEY LEFT OFF AT THE END OF SEASON ONE. IT WOULD BE GREAT TO DEAL WITH THE POLITICS OF SHOULD THE GALACTICANS JOIN THE PEOPLE OF TERRA? SHOULD THEY WORK TO UNIFY THE EASTERN AND WESTERN ALLIANCES BECAUSE OF THE EMERGENCY OF THE COMING EXTERMINATORS OF HUMANITY: THE WICKED CYLONS?  I KNOW I WOULDN'T WANT TO MOVE ON WITHOUT AN ALLIANCE BECAUSE THE TERRAN TYPE PEOPLE WE DID MEET IN THOSE EPISODES WERE PRECIOUS SUCH AS HECTOR AND VECTOR AND THE PARENTS/CHILDREN ON PARADEEN! UPON ACHIEVING A STABLE DEFENSE WOULD THE NEW GALACTICAN ALLIANCE SEND OUT AN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE TO FIND AND SEEK THE HELP OF EARTH? AS STAR TREK'S SPOCK WOULD SAY ""THERE ARE ALWAYS POSSIBILITIES."" MAY SHOWS LIKE SUPERMAN, STAR TREK, STAR WARS, AND BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, THAT TEACH MORALITY AND THE NATURE OF EVIL ""LIVE LONG AND PROSPER!""",1453507200,3,5682,4.735353535353536

6853383,5,B00Q2OQNCM,"This short review addresses thsi particular package rather than the series itself.  If you paid this much for one movie and its derivative one-season TV show from the 1970s, you're already a fan and don't need to be told about it.  (Yes, I'm ignoring the unlamented ""Galactica 1980"" -- as most BSG fans do.)  :D

I have the original DVD issue in the Cylon helmet box and there just is no comparison -- detail, color, and sound are all infinitely superior.  The remastering was well worth the effort and brings new life to this old series.  The blu-ray edition really shows off how beautifully designed and shot this series was.  The level of detail in John Dykstra's models really jumps out at you.  These models hold their own against today's CGI and the set designs, props, and costumes are orders of magnitude better than Ron D. Moore's ""reimagination"".

If you want a real treat try watching this on a TV that does 2D-to-3D conversion and enjoy as you watch the Cylon raiders and Colonial Vipers seem to fly out of the screen at you.  It may not have been shot in 3D but it sure looks good in it.",1450051200,,1100,4.482412060301508

The wires where visible, and the image was not sharp. The sound was much better. If I where going to buy it again I would just get the BD OF The original widescreen with no extras. The 1980 series was really bad. The actors where even more stilted than on TOS. The stories where preachy, and they tried but failed to send a message. The quality of the 1980 series was very bad.

Only disappointing thing is Universal have chosen not to do any restoration or restoring of the prints for HD, so dirt and scratches are evident at times. It's as good as you remember (or as cheesy) if you're a fan like me and prefer this to the confusing remake, and the widescreen prints are relatively well framed on the whole for the most part, although of course you can pick between the two.

Not as many extras as the German blu ray, and the only new thing is a brief restoration short (although as I say they haven't really done much). Scenes vary for it;s age between being pin sharp and nice and colourful and clear, to grainy and occasionally dark.

6853419,1,B00Q2OQNCM,"What a letdown.  I purchased this set already owning the German Koch media bluray that was released 2 years ago. The reason being that Universal led us to believe that this would be the Galactica set to rule them all. I believed that if a semi - official German set had produced such a wonderful  collection with beautiful HD transfers, then the official US would be the dogs bollocks.  The widescreen presentation does not seem to be sourced from the original camera negatives and is full of scratches and blemishes, close ups of faces look too soft and original special effects just seem too blurry and zoomed. IMO if they had gone with the total cleanup and new Cgi  route then the widescreen presentation would have worked much better. It seems to me as if they had thought about it then abandoned the idea at the last moment.
The full screen presentation has been sourced directly from the German blu-ray sets. A side by side comparison showed that both transfers were identical. Nothing new  for me but at least it's good for U.S. fans who could not watch the German release. Again universal had the opportunity of doing an even better job , going back and remastering them to an even higher standard than Koch media , but did they do that -nope they just used the same prints .After all they were good enough right?

The only improvement over the Koch media German release are that you do not forcibly have to watch them with the subtitles on. Other than that all they have to offer are the same dvd extras carried over (which for a first time viewer are nothing short of amazing- especially the deleted scenes) and a new short featurette about how the widescreen presentations were prepared.

To make matters worse, I don't live in USA or Canada so I cannot receive the replacement  discs.

Other posters have said it, if Universal had given it the star trek treatment  that it deserved then it might have been a lovely presentation.  As it stands it a so-so 2-3 stars. The reason I give it 1 star only is because It carries nothing new for me.",1433548800,8,2052,4.548913043478261

6853423,1,B00Q2OQNCM,"The possibilities for Battlestar Galactica were limitless, but the morons with no vision at ABC, threw away the goose and all the golden eggs.  That is why I gave this review a one star for that and for Galactica 1980 which was too late and too stupid.

It's only right to rail against such idiocy.  ABC blew it big time.  The original series could easily have gone ten years or more.  How can you bring back a series after cancelling it and not include Apollo, Starbuck, Boomer, Colonel Tigh, Cassiopeia, Sheba and Athena.  Without them and Adama, there is no Battlestar Galactica --- period!  And what of the treacherous and versatile villain, Baltar?  Irreplaceable!  He spiced up all their encounters.

Even though the series improved after every episode, the studio began screwing it from the get go.  Female pilots?  They had an agenda.  They did that to get in line with the equal rights/feminist movement.  That took a lot of the manfulness out of the squadrons.  Okay the men got sick. (But why write the episode in the first place, right?)  Once they men returned they should have placed all the women into inactive reserve for emergencies only.  That was the first screw up -- female pilots.

Sheba was just too feminine to be a viper pilot and would have been more attractive in another occupation like Cassiopeia.

The other negative aspect was including Boxey in the cast.  First, the kid was a corny actor and they had to concentrate too much of the cast around him.  He and that dumb animal should have died along with Serina, that way Apollo would have maintained a more manly aspect like Starbuck.  Poor Apollo was forced to bear that dead weight.

Those two things were thorns in the side of the original series.

Galactica 1980 should never have been shot and it was lunacy to air it.  The last episode of the original series was one of the best, if not the best of the series and the new episode should have aired following that train of thought.  The acting and chemistry was awesome in that episode and it could only have gotten better.  As I mentioned before the cast was steadily improving in all aspects.

If it had been up to me, I would have rehired the original cast (except the kid and his pet) at increased salaries, increased the budget for the special effects, writers and directors.  The squadrons would have reverted back to total testosterone.

They tried to resurrect it with new a series in 2004 but it was over in 1979 after episode 24 aired.

So long Battlestar Galactica.  You were much better than Star Wars, and they didn't know it.

P.S.  The widescreen versions are in your face and make watching them uncomfortable.  It's dumb to show widescreen movies in 1:33 and it's dumb to convert 1:33 to widescreen.  The formula is really simple:  show them in the format they were originally shot.",1432339200,4,2834,4.641129032258065
6853424,4,B00Q2OQNCM,"I am not going to review BSG as a series, you are interested in this set because you love the show. My review is for the Blu-Ray set which I will say right off that The Definitive set is well worth it! First a warning, The series is NOT meant to be seen in widescreen! The feature film (and the pilot by default) is the only thing that was meant to be seen in widescreen. The feature film was shot with 1.85:1 in mind for a theatrical release and was meant to be matted to 1.85:1 (trimming the top and bottom and opening up the sides) but was also protected for TV (opening up the top & bottom and trimming the sides to achieve 1.33:1, the TV ratio of the time). The feature film is also a different edit (and better IMO) than the pilot version. Once you get to the first episode ""Lost Planet Of The Gods"" The widescreen framing looks wrong. (Examples included with this review) Heads are cut off, framing looks unnatural and cramped, and things are cut off in general. I went back and started again watching everything in ""full frame"" (Full frame is a misleading term) 1.33:1 where everything looks like it should. I am totally against faking widescreen which is the case here. The picture quality is outstanding! Sharp and colorful. There are some grainy shots, but if they use DNR to remove grain, it destroys detail and causes ""smearing"", so grain is the lesser of 2 evils. Keep in mind this was a TV show made in the 70s with lots of visual effects. Some shots are still going to have dirt and scratches that can't be removed, but a lot of the major damage has been removed as shown in the special feature ""Battlestar Galactica: Remastered"" which is only on the ""widescreen"" version included in ""The Definitve Collection"". My other gripe with this set is the ""5.1"" audio. It was lazily ""mixed"". If a proper 5.1 mix can't be done, leave it in it's original mono or stereo (In the case of the BSG series, mono) It sounds like the dialog was put in the center (where it, for the most part) belongs. But it sounds like the effects and music were just spread into the left & right with little or no mixing / panning but with a fake ""stereo"" effect. This is really annoying when a viper flies from one side of the screen to the other and the audio stays in both the left and right channel with no left to right panning. It's also annoying that when Muffet barks and it comes from the left and right channel when it should be centered. These are just a couple of examples but the audio over all is like this for BSG. I would have been happier if the original mono audio was included. I know it's an older TV show and all the original elements may be lost making it impossible for a proper 5.1 mix. The original Star Trek series has a fantastic 7.1 mix, but all the original elements must have existed for them to do that. All the gripes aside, this is a significant upgrade from the DVDs. The feature film is included in the Definitive set and is the ONLY BSG that is made for widescreen. The feature film includes the original mono ""Sensurround"" (2.1) which packs a powerful punch when you have a killer sub-woofer hooked up to your system. So in a nutshell, Movie is great in widescreen and 2.1 audio, From ""Lost Planet Of The Gods"" on should be viewed in 4x3 ""full Frame"" and NOT widescreen (examples given in pics), 5.1 audio on BSG is annoying at times. Picture quality over all is excellent. Battlestar Galactic: The Definitve collection is the way to go!",1432252800,23,3459,4.381026438569207
6853425,1,B00Q2OQNCM,"I have just watched the episode 'The Magnificent Warriors' and was guttered to discover that 2 and a half minutes have been edited out of the 16.9 widescreen version.
It's the scene where the towns people realise Adama and the others are from the colonies and he salutes them as colonial warriors.
There is also a scene that is gone aboard the Galactica directly after that too.
I was actually really impressed with the quality of the remaster but this edit, or fault by Universal is unforgivable.
I am actually worried about the rest of the set now as this only the first episode I've watched, having read read this fault elsewhere so had to check it out for myself.
Hopefully Universal will reissue this set with the missing footage intact.
I am now wondering if other episodes are also missing segments.
Please let me know if you notice any missing scenes.
'The Living Legend' Part 2 is still missing the opening teaser on both versions of this set.
This definitive collection should have also included 'Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack' and 'Conquest Of The Earth'.",1432166400,6,1072,4.768817204301075
6853426,5,B00Q2OQNCM,"Oh man, is this box-set a treat! Hard to believe this show is already a little over 35 years old.

Prior to this blu-ray release I owned the DVD set and even though I enjoyed the DVDs immensely, you could tell they really didn't perform any kind of clean-up on the video. Or if they did, it was very little because the video was plagued with imperfections and left-over special FX artifacts. For instance, in one of the scenes on one of the DVDs, you could see a greenish square around one of the space-ships caused by whatever method they used back then to create the visual.

Not so with this Blu-Ray set. The video transfer looks amazing! (Picture attached). Yes, if you look closely you may still notice the occasional minor defect, but considering the age of this material, this is probably as good as it will ever be.

This particular set (the definitive collection) contains the original full-screen version, as well as a wide-screen version. I was curious as to how the wide-screen version would look, thinking the cropping / adjusting of the original aspect ratio into a 16:9 ratio would probably not do it much good, but I was pleasantly surprised. Obviously something had to give, but I can honestly say I didn't feel I was missing anything.

This set also contains the Galactica 1980 series in both full-screen and wide-screen. Yes, I know, I know, Galactica 1980 wasn't exactly a huge hit, but I for one am glad it is part of this set.

If you are a die-hard (original) Battlestar Galactica fan, you can't go wrong with this set.",1432080000,10,1542,4.613138686131387

6853429,5,B00Q2OQNCM,"Wow.  Dodged a bullet here.  I almost ordered the Remastered version instead of the Definitive version, thinking that if it was remastered to HD Blu standards, I was not a purist enough to care about the framing, etc. that a lot of the fanboys have been whining about for months and months.  Then the price came down and down, and I opted for the Definitive version with the full screen and widescreen versions.  Nowhere could I find any reviews before the product came out of the end results of said remastering.  Frankly, it made me nervous.  I trusted my nerves and switched up.

There is no comparison.  If you are a Blu Ray HD nut, you need the Definitive version because the full frame picture is noticeably better.  In more than a few ways.  The picture is more crisp, brighter and with better dark levels at the same time.  Warmer (the remastered widescreen has a blue tint to it all through--subtle, but there and noticeable; it washes out to color compared to the other remaster).  The details on the model work, helmets, and the clothing details and skin textures is better (a lot of it is the color levels but some of it is grain).  It's tight.  It's what you hoped Battlestar could look like on Blu.  It's deep and gorgeous in palette.  Athena looks better.  The vipers look better.  Adama's neck pendant looks better.  The cylons down below their master up in the chair are easier to see.  Everyone's hair looks better.  And with this much feathered hair, that is an important detail . . .

The widescreen version is totally watchable. If you just can't stand the picture not filling the screen, you're in.  Just never let anyone show you those full screen episodes.  Ever.  I watched the first disc through of the widescreen version first, thinking that was what I was after and the full screen was just for fun--but I totally bought this version just in case I was wrong.  A day later, I popped in the full screen version for the inevitable comparison.  I now know I can never get those hours back I wasted watching Battlestar for the first time in decades on a Blu Ray disc in that degraded widescreen remaster.  Which still looks way better by miles than the last time you watched Battlestar, no doubt.

I'm sure I'm making it sound worse than it really is, but if you're on the fence and a Blu Ray aficionado, you need to know that the widescreen remaster is inferior.  It just had to be done by a totally different team (or on the cheap compared to the full screen remaster somehow).  Now, it's not a total horror show.  It's fine. It's more than watchable.  It makes the previous versions available look terrible.  It's just not the same remaster and it's objectively not as good a remaster as the full screen.  It's really surprising.  The problem is not the framing or cropping.  They did a fantastic job with all that.  In many cases, the shot is just plain wider and in every other respect the same as the full screen but with more framing with set, just like you hoped.  In other cases, it wasn't possible to do that.  I think in especially these cases, the grain and resolution takes a hit because they literally just hit some kind of ""zoom"" to fill the screen.  All through, though, the color is less vibrant and warm than the full screen, so that is the real issue.  With most or all of the model work, it seems to fall into the ""obviously zoomed"" category, so it almost all looks better on the full screen.

I wanted to like that widescreen version.  But I am watching the rest of this show through in the hotter, warmer, tighter full screen version.",1431907200,49,3580,4.500777604976672

6853431,1,B00Q2OQNCM,"By the lords of Kobol... Where to start...first off, I liked the idea of widescreen and standard screen in this set so you can watch from a different perspective. Second, I am not too happy at the Blu Ray conversion of this set. I guess I am used to buying Blu Ray sets and seeing a HUGE difference in screen definition and clarity of images. IE-Batman from 1966, ANY of the Star Trek Blu Rays or other Blu Ray sets that you can tell there is a HUGE DIFFERENCE.

BSG on the other hand was ok at best. I have the orignal DVD set from 2004 and I compared both discs. Upone start up I really thought that there was something wrong with my set that maybe this was not a Blu Ray set! It's that shocking to me that you really do not see a huge difference from this release compared to the DVD set in 2004.

Blu Ray is a step up from the original 2004 set, but not as good as the other sets mentioned above. With other Blu Ray sets you have that look of watching LIVE TV and you can tell that who ever did the up convert from standard to HD/Blu Ray knew what they were doing.

I have always held Universal in a low regard with their double sided disks or lack of good quality DVD releases. On this set, you can tell that they did not spend a lot time, money or energy into really putting out a good product. Sound quality is good just like the 2004 set and I am listening to it with an Onkyo 2015 5.1 surround sound 4K upconvert system. I am watching this set on a 2 year old Samsung 55' LED 3D TV with the Onkyo UPCONVERT 4K receiver and still the images are lack luster at best. The ships and the space scenes with the special affects are just ok and do not pop out at you like you would see in Star Trek etc. It looks like they upconverted the regular scenes on the bridge, on the planets etc but the battle scenes still look standard definition to me and you can see the back and forth quality as the show progresses through the episode. I know some of you out there will say "" This was made in the late 70's, what do you expect? "" Well to that being said, I say look at what CBS did to Star Trek TOS. That set is amazing, and you can tell they spent money and time on it!

I was really looking forward to this set and to see the huge differences from standard definition to high def but its really not that big of a difference in my book. I am looking over all the other reviews on here and quite frankly I do not see what all the hype is about for this set. Did anyone really watch these and pop them into your blu ray player?

I love BSG and grew up watching this in the 70's and the 80's. Save your money on this set and wait a few months....I cant see spending the $91.00 I paid for this set on Amazon. If this set is under $50.00 its an ok deal more than that save your money and wait for it to drop because I bet sales on this set aren't going to be that great.

UPDATE: 5/22/15-Just saw episode The Lost Warrior on Disk 2 Full Frame set and Im done with this garbage! There is SO MUCH BACKGROUND Noise to the picture and it looks VERY GRAINY!

It's super awesome to have these on BLU-RAY since it's the best possible copy released to date. That being said, this is far from perfect. There are a ton of visible scratches and other debris on these prints and it looks like there was not any effort to fix/correct those issues. The Non-effect shots for the most part are pretty sharp and look good, however blurry shots keep popping up. I am not sure if this was caused by having to fit it to widescreen or not, but watching an episode you will notice a handful of shots that just look blurry all of a sudden. The FX shots are a mixed bag. While most appear decent, there are some that are super duper blurry..mind you most are ok..but there are enough that pop up that you will notice it.

The extra's are cool. You get like every unused shot they made for the show. Many of which I have never seen before. The quality of these are very low however.

I'm not sure it's really worth getting the definitive version...the widescreens seem fine.

6853436,5,B00Q2OQNCM,"Battlestar Galactica is a throwback to my childhood.  I was glued to our black and white TV every week to watch a series unlike any other series that had been on air before.  When I first of the the rebirth of the series a few years ago, I was very skeptical with the changes I had heard of.  As it turned out, the new BG turned out to be a fantastic series.  I wondered when the original classic series would be released on Blu-ray.  Well....here it is.  And you have two versions to pick from: the remastered widescreen edition, or the Definitive Edition with BOTH widescreen and original full frame version, PLUS the original theatrical version of the pilot.

When I first heard they were remastering this to fit current widescreen TV's, I have to admit I was intrigued.  But I also had fond memories of the original format, so I chose to purchase the Definitive Edition for an extra $20.  So......is it worth the extra expense???  Before I answer that, let me start with the packaging.  The outer slipcase is quite nice.  It's a sturdy cardboard with a metallic look to the outer artwork.  The lettering of the title is raised, and the cylon head is slightly raised from the surface.  The reflective nature of the artwork is really nice to look at.  Inside the box are 5 hard shell blu-ray cases. One for the original series in widescreen, one of the same in full frame, one of the 1980 series in widescreen, and one of the same in full frame, and finally one with the single disc of the theatrical release of the pilot episode.

Now let's get to what's on the discs.  The first one I watched was the remastered widescreen version.  Right off from the title screen I thought that something looked....off.  It wasn't the crisp image I was expecting.  I immediately thought of the glorious remastered version of Space 1999 (see my Amazon review of that classic set), and how fantastic it looks on blu-ray.  With BG being a newer show, I expected similar results.  There is noticeable scratches and scuffs that pop across the screen, and the colors look somewhat washed out.  There is also a lack of crispness that you would expect from high definition.  I wasn't sure if it was due to the zoom in that was necessary to create a widescreen image from the original full screen element.  To check that out, I popped in the same episode from the full frame set.  As soon as the titles came on, there was a noticeable difference.  The starry backgrounds have a much nicer blackness to them with the stars popping off the background.  There is also no denying that the special effects look much better on the full frame versions.  One thing that was very noticeable in the widescreen was the ""matting"" around the ships as they travel around the screen.  When you watch the full frame version, it is just not that evident.  The effects are much clearer, and the colors are much more crisp in the full frame versions.  Another very noticeable difference is the skin tones.  In the widescreen versions, there is a waxy look to the skin, but in the full frame versions, the skin tones are much more natural.  One final thing I have to point out is that in the cropping of the original format, you really do lose a lot of screen information.

While I was so excited about the widescreen version, after viewing it, I am surprised that I prefer the original full frame episodes.  The sound quality on them seem to be identical, but there is no way you could watch both and not realize that the widescreen version is inferior to the full frame.  If you're a true BG fan, do yourself a favor and spend the extra few dollars to get the original series in the best looking version I have ever seen it, the full frame version.  It is truly the most ideal way to see this fantastic series in high definition.",1431561600,16,3791,4.504398826979473

6853438,4,B00Q2OQNCM,"Here are my observations about the Definitive Collection blu-ray set:

  *The full-frame versions seem to be the same transfers/discs used in the international blu-ray releases, supported by the wide variety of language options at the beginning of each disc as well as audio tracks.  The ""Galactica 1980"" episodes have the ""Battlestar Galactica"" titles in the title sequence for episodes 3-10.  The printing on the discs is in black.

  *The widescreen versions have fewer language tracks and subtitle options.  The majority of the differences from the full-frame set are on the ""Galactica 1980"" episodes: new DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 soundtracks; 2 discs instead of 3; restored ""Galactica 1980"" titles to episodes 4-10; and a weird 2-second insert shot of the Galactica prior to the beginning of ""The Return of Starbuck"" after the main titles (audio was not affected).  There is also a short documentary titled ""Battlestar Galactica Remastered"" on Disc 6 of the original series explaining the remastering and restoration process and how they created the widescreen versions (essentially they went back to the original films of the episodes, scanned them at 2K, then digitally removed the defects/blemishes as best they could, restored the color, then manually did a pan & scan of each shot).  The printing on the discs is in blue.

Overall, I like this set, and aside from the 3-hour pilot version, I think they did a very nice job on the 2K remastering and restoration of the episodes; they've never looked better, and it helps the series look more 'contemporary', aside from the hairstyles, fx, etc (although I still think the fx, while criminally re-used, hold up well).  The fx shots don't always consistently look quite as nice since the original fx elements were not cleaned up (if they even still exist). The bitrates on the video seem to be vary a little, around 28-30MBS or even higher (35MBS) on the episodes I looked at.  I've seen details I've never ever noticed before during my 37 years of viewing this show on ABC, syndication, recorded videotapes, VHS, DVD and digital.  While I generally am a purist when it comes to home video releases of my favorite TV shows, I have to say that I am enjoying these widescreen versions for the most part.  My main objections to the set are the pricing of the set (I think at $85 on Amazon currently, it's overpriced by about $40 or so) and the relative lack of new extras (aside from the 'Remastered' doc), and failure to convert the old extras to 1080p or even 720p, plus the menus are weak (especially the full-frame ones, a port from the international set)--I actually think the menus from the original DVD set (with the video clips and thunderous bass) are much better.

I appreciate the fact that Universal made the extra effort to take another pass on the widescreen versions, particularly Galactica 1980, instead of simply re-framing the previous international full-frame blu-ray release.  However, these don't have all the added value and TLC that CBS DVD gave the original ""Star Trek"" and ""TNG"" blu-rays, although the widescreen documentary shows that the people working on this release genuinely care about the show and are fans.

Now if you want to open a new can of worms, I can go into nauseating detail about the various differences that the lousy so-called ""HD"" Netflix versions have from the Amazon digital versions and the Vudu digital versions, each of which have differences from each other and these new blu-ray releases and the original DVD set.

The only gripe I have is that I would have liked it if they would have taken the time to clean up the prints a bit.  Not that it's terrible, but the light scratches and some of the ""boxes around ships as another reviewer mentioned"" can be distracting.  But, admittedly, that is a whole different process from the HD Remastering and we'd likely be paying a bunch more for this set if they did.  Is it worth the money ... for me, yes, I'm a big fan of both the Classic and Re-imagined Series.  Would I have been just as happy with just the Widescreen version, absolutely not ... again, BIG FAN.  Did I already have virtually everything in this set already on DVD (except the wide screen series transfers) ... you bet ... even the movie.  If you're not a big fan (or you are and don't care about the Full Frame version), would I recommend this for $20.00 more vs just the Widescreen Remastered set ... probably not, you'll get the 1978 and 1980 series, and that's all you really need to view everything.  The movie (as mentioned previously) is just a multi-part episode with a slightly different ending to wrap up the story in theaters.  Since the series basically already includes it, albeit a bit different (and the series continues), you don't really need that.

Now if they would just release Caprica on Blu ray (for Region 1), that would complete my Battlestar Galactica HD Collection!!!",1431475200,4,1553,4.530465949820789
6853442,5,B00Q2OQNCM,"Lets cut the felgercarb. This is everything from the original Galactica television series back in the 70's. Both the original first season and the second ""Galactica 1980"" season are here as well as the theatrical releases. The Definitive collection comes with a score of awesome extras, but other reviewers have covered that. I'm here to answer some biting questions a few of you may have: How does it look?

In a word great! This is not a transfer from the German Blu-Ray previously released. This is a BRAND NEW remaster that I think was done from an original film negative. It looks much better than any DVD or Blu-Ray that came before it. Colors are more vibrant and the image is a lot cleaner. No more bland color palettes. I did notice dark and shady scenes do seem slightly darker, but you still get much better detail. The Definitive Collection is special because it presents you with the series in both a 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios. How did they do it? Does that mean pan and scan or stretched images to fit the ratios? No way. It appears they got the original film and cropped two totally separate versions depending on the aspect ratio.

The 4:3 version has the sides cropped more and you get just about the entire top and bottom filmed. The 16:9 aspect ratio crops a bit off the top and bottom with the sides in full view. The end result is impressive. They took special care in cropping these. You are losing absolutely nothing important on the screen. No heads are cut off. No nifty detail was omitted. On the 16:9 widescreen you lose a bit of dirt and a bit of sky so to speak while the 4:3 you lose maybe half of that last step of someone walking out to the left in the background. I have seen about half of the episodes in both aspect ratios. Trust me. You aren't missing anything with these new croppings. The 16:9 is the best as you get slightly more footage than the 4:3. This also means the 4:3 isn't 100% exact as it was broadcast on TV, but don't fret. Since they got the footage from the original film you aren't losing much, if anything at all (little known secret is lots of shows get cropped before broadcast anyways because of the differences in ratios between the TV screen and the film).

So there you have it. If you have been on the fence in getting this out of concern about the image quality and screwy aspect ratios you can rest easy and fear not. This collection is lovingly remastered and presented in the best available way. If you remember the old show and would love a pristine copy without any crazy packaging to keep it from fitting on the shelf with the rest of your collection (I'm talking to you Special Edition DVD from 2004) this is exactly the one to buy.",1431388800,12,2703,4.423694779116466

But, I am going to stick with the blue boxed definitive collection set. And, enjoy the hell out of this series as it was meant to be experienced.

As for the GALACTICA 1980 discs. I think, with some foam core board, they will make beautiful coasters. Just kidding. I might watch the 10-episodes of that series once, but the iconic classic will be the discs I watch the most. I hope the green film cuts of the Cylon Raiders and Vipers will be phased out of this set. In the theatrical film I bought the green emulsion around the models where the model shots were inserted, tumble and twist as the ships are flying in space.

This set gets 5 stars from me, to also help off-set the one star a galmagging snit rad gave the set for the price of it. What duhtard does that!?",1429142400,2,1198,4.22707423580786

8690104,5,B00Q2OQNCM,"I debated on which Battlestar Galactica collection set to get and settled on the Definitive Collection.  I love having the option of watching the episodes in both the original 4:3 television format and the ""reformated"" widescreen version.  I have a 4K HDTV and I must say of the two formats I like the 4:3 aspect ratio better because the screen image is sharper in its original TV size.  Don't get me wrong, they did a great job ""reformating"" the series to widescreen and it looks really good (there has been some color correction and cleaning of the film when they converted it to digital), but the images are just not quite as sharp since they have been zoomed in on to fill a widescreen format.  The widescreen version also crops off some of the top and bottom of the 4:3 frame (they do place the letterbox on the action so it's not just a cookie cutter center frame shot with heads getting cut off at the top, etc.), but you do lose some of the picture.  However, its still cool to see it in widescreen, so it's a total win/win when you get the Definitive Collection.",1525219200,,1071,4.4438775510204085
