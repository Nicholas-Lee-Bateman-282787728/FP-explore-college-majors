4992509,5,B006J1OCHG,One of the best produced documentaries that I have seen.  The only thing that I have seen that was not included is the You Tube footage I recently saw of McVeigh in a tank indicating he may have been with the army way after they said he had been out and was part of the militia.  Mainstream enough for uninitiated audiences.,1327622400,13,324,4.295081967213115
4992510,5,B006J1OCHG,"I can honestly say I never thought much of the tragedy which happened in Oklahoma city so long ago.  I always assumed it was an open and closed case.  Well that was how I felt, until I saw the movie Zeitgeist.  Looking for answers or truths behind accusations, I came across mentions of the Oklahoma City bombing, which eventually led to the watching of this film.
  It opened my eyes.
I recommend this movie to anyone who feels the USA has lost its way.  Hopefully it will get citizens talking and looking for educated solutions.",1327622400,26,530,4.526315789473684
4992511,5,B006J1OCHG,"I read every word of the McVeigh trial and there is so much more information in this movie that was missing from the trial, or the trial only grazed upon, it's just mind boggling. So many times during the trial I was asking myself ""and then...."" waiting for the defense to take the next step only for them to just stop questioning or dismiss the witness. This documentary goes into all those missing moments from the trial, and then some. I don't know if the lawyers were just too afraid to go down the road, or that the judge ruled they could not, but for whatever reason, the truth was not revealed at the trial. This movie really needs to be watched by every American. I felt it was very well done and worthy of your time.

Also, I recommend you buy the book ""How To Kill 11 Million People"" and then watch this movie. The two messages work together very well and the book can be read in 20 minutes. But the lesson from these two works may change how you view our country, and certainly our institutions.",1326758400,119,1006,4.322751322751323

To try to convince us Tim McVeigh and his fellow racist right wing gun nuts are victims of some kind of oppression?  The ammonium nitrate bomb isn't powerful enough? This is proved by a similar device in a van used elsewhere?
Don't these people pay attention - don't they know that McVeigh used Jet Fuel instead of fuel oil? Don't they know the Ryder truck full is 8 times the volume of the van? Don't they know McVeigh secured a huge quantity of additional compacted explosives combined with his Jet Fuel soaked ammonium nitrate?
Then they try to claim the ammonium nitrate would have left choking clouds of noxious gasses for hours? HOGWASH
an explosion of this type sucks all the air into the blast and disperses it quickly and completely.

Some of the survivors say they heard two separate explosions, followed by  blast debris  thrown out and away from the front of the building.
Military, engineers, explosive experts examine the evidence and all disagree with the government explanations to the American public. Within three days the government began to weave its sordid fantasy  story denying the truth . Money,power,greed. How and why would our own government kill its innocent civilians. follow the money.

That poor fellow whose feet were burned off with blow torches had a courageous lawyer brother who insisted on picking up the body and discovered the awful truth of how American law enforcement treat innocent Americans.  The guy was a former Viet Nam vet who had substance abuse problems and never met McVeigh.

My reason for originally purchasing this video was a story I read on the organization of citizens from Oklahoma that got together because -- due to witness statements, untimely suspicious witness deaths and flimsy explanations from government investigators -- they decided to band together and investigate the matter themselves. Why? Because when a witness says they observed something and then are told by investigators, ""no, you didn't see that, what you saw was _____,"" a brave citizen will demand more.

I knew nothing about this and really never questioned it. All I knew is that Timothy McVeigh was super-fast-tracked to his execution and that every single surveillance tape was confiscated by the FBI and never shown -- and now I know why.

I found it very impressive that police, first responders, survivors and members of victims were interviewed. All extremely credible without a lick of hearsay.

Ignorance is NOT bliss; in the Holocaust, it has been reported that those who ignorantly and willingly complied without putting up a struggle were the first to die.

Very often you will find contrarian investigators making true statements, but that do not actually support the point they think they are making.  This documentary collects many hundreds of points that directly contradict some of the FBI's conclusions without the non-sequiturs I am used to seeing.  What is most interesting is that not only do these points contradict the FBI's findings, but that they all contradict it in the same direction.  That is to say that hundreds of people in federal, state, and local government, police and rescue workers, witnesses, survivors, a grand jury, an Air Force general, private investigators, and the local news channel 4 all tell a story that fits with each other perfectly, but that is incompatible with the FBI's story.

While this film does not prove that the bombing was a deliberate false flag attack (though it is strongly suggested) it certainly obliterates what the FBI concludes and brings together everyone else into a coherent picture of what happened.

Since watching this I looked into the event more deeply and found that ""A Noble Lie"" is merely a scratch in the surface and that there are many more things that have come out surrounding this event that dovetail with the thesis of this film.  The strangest being the FBI crime lab supervisor who blew the whistle when he discovered that his reports were being changed by his superiors without his knowledge, so that his work would no longer contradict various ""official stories"" including this one.",1359244800,8,1726,5.074204946996466

mother ATF wears combat boots.

A Noble Lie opens with enough information about Waco and McVeigh to establish that the ATF could have been a target for the explosion imploding a building where they had an office. Someone who investigated the elevators disputes the idea that an ATF person was in an elevator that dropped five floors. Which elevator? What people are upset about is how much informatrion got tossed one way or another without regard for whoever knew what was really going on. The extra bombs that were removed from the building were probably some military hardware that had no business being in the midst of so many civilian activities, but there they were like nuclear submarines getting too close to Japan after world war two. American sick puppies would lay the most blame for that war on Nagasaki because the war ended up being their war as much as our own.

History has grown with the ability to personify behaviors. George W. Bush was the personification of an American sick puppy president (he tried to kill my dad).

To all of our customers:

It has been an incredible honor to have helped co-produce this film and to work with of one of the BEST film crews I've had the opportunity to collaborate with in over (31) years in the film and television industry.  The (41) reviews posted here thus far come from a wide variety of viewers within the U.S.

This DVD has sold very well in (24) foreign countries and here in the United States at a pace way beyond the original expectations of Free Mind Films.  Mind you, right before its release on December 2, 2011, our crew and support staff knew this film was well produced.  Nevertheless, we had no idea that it would be this popular and well received.  Especially, more than (18) years since that fateful day on a cool, sunny morning in downtown OKC in April of '95.

Thanks to your support, our film has been chosen in TEN,(10) different film festivals; selected as 'Best Picture - Historical/Reality - Feature Documentary' in (4) of those film festivals and 'Finalist' in (2).  T

'A Noble Lie - Oklahoma City 1995' is a primer of sorts.  Just as the previous comments on this review board bear out.  This film helps first time or veteran truth-seekers gain a better understanding of the local, national and international criminal events taking place around us nearly every week.

This film is NOT an end-all, be-all project.  First you crawl, then you walk, then you run.  It may very well get you to a 'walking' pace in a measured, professional and respectful manner.  And it is based on the FBI's and D.O.J's own internal documents.

I'll close with this comment: ""The unvarnished truth has a way of bubbling to the surface and getting recognized for what it truly is. Our peers in Georgia, Oklahoma, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas agree. We at FreeMindFilms are truly blessed as these film festival invitations and awards keep rolling into our Oklahoma City studio. This would not have been possible without the (unexpected) incredible DVD sales and the support of our customers in (24) foreign countries and here in the U.S. THANK YOU for your sincre interest in the truth.""

I can't say for sure where or when I came across literature that claimed that what happened in Oklahoma was somehow connected to 9/11 and our government's response/involvement.  This stuff was ""way out there"" for most Americans and it was difficult for me to quantify the whole picture to others around me about 9/11 and Oklahoma.

I wish that this DVD had been produced sooner, the clarity with precise information with interviews is exceptional and clearly shows that there is a criminal element within our government. This DVD has been a wonderful addition.  If I want to show someone what is going on in our society and the conduct/COVERUP of our government, this exceptional work, A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City 1995, is one of the first examples that I reach for now.

Even though more Americans are starting to wake up to what is going on in our government with the internet and private, self-publishing, the exceptional way in that the information presented in this outstanding production cuts through the ambiguity and propaganda, to clearly show that there are elements within our government that have clearly cover-up their criminality and blatant disregard to the Constitution of the United States.

If you don't want to know the undeniable facts about the Oklahoma federal building destruction and the murder of Americans children, and our government's involvement, don't watch this DVD.  For those who have not been exposed to what is really going on and are ready to wake up, or others that already have a foundation of understanding, watch this with your love ones.  Take notes and follow up and find out for yourself if this DVD is factual or not.  Don't take what I have to say as the truth, look for yourself, it's here.

I leave you with one small example in this DVD, where a Nuclear Physicist quotes ""I believe that the demolitions charges in the building, that were placed inside at certain key concrete columns, did the primary damage in the Murrah Federal Building.  It would have been absolutely impossible, and against the laws of nature, for a truck full of fertilizer and oil...no matter how much was used...to bring the building down"" Dr. Samuel T. Cohen, Nuclear Physicist. If nothing else, cut and paste the Doctor's name in your search engine and be ready for what you're going to see. Americans need to wake up! Please take the time to see this DVD. Your safety is compromised without seeing the facts first.",1338940800,21,3049,5.738359201773836
4992595,5,B006J1OCHG,"Very big coverup.  The FBI and ATF gave these so called ""manufactured terrorists"" the material and means to blow up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City for political reasons Bill and Hillary's connection to White Water, also did not want to debate about some new anti-terrorism law in Congress.
Still a lot of unanswered questions by the shadow government and the powerful elite.  Repent for your sins.

  In High School I took the news of this as what was reported, and I remember going on Church Service Project in the summer of 1996 to help the Hopi tribe in Arizona.  On the way there our church youth group stopped to see the site Oklahoma City, signed some T-shirt with our groups names and prayed for those lost souls.",1337990400,7,727,4.640625
4992596,5,B006J1OCHG,"The two ugliest things about the 9/11 event were evidence of government foreknowledge and evidence of the government manipulation, handling or sponsorship of some of the key players.  This DVD does a huge, historic service not only in revealing the evidences for those particularly ugly aspects, but also, by allowing us to see and hear the faces and voices of those wonderful and courageous Oklahomans like Hoppy Heidelberg, Jane Grahm, Charles Keys, and numerous others who have done more than all Federal Agencies combined to reveal the truth about the disaster.  But I worded that poorly because the Federal government was manifestly not trying to find the whole truth. It was trying to create a mythological version and to bury the rest - literally.  They destroyed and buried as much of the evidence as they could.  (Which is the single greatest reason to buy and watch this video - to compare earlier examples of false-flag terrorist acts to more recent ones like 9/11 wherein they also busied themselves destroying crucial evidence from the collapsed hulks of the two towers and WTC 7...)  For the first time I got to see, close-up, a massive example of the giant steel-reinforced concrete beams and joints that were utterly turned into powder by high-breisance explosives, leaving three foot lengths of 2"" steel rebar hanging in the breeze in exactly the manner which Air Force Brig. General Benton Partin talked about non-stop after he examined the ruins.  This is totally inconsistent with blast effects of a low-velocity ANFO explosive, acting only through air-pressure, from a detonation point many meters away.  Another fact that is inconsistent with ANFO was the absence of heavy and distinctive Ammonia fumes.  During a comparable Madison, Wisconsin ANFO bombing decades ago, 30 people were hospitalized due to those fumes alone, while at OKC, people spoke of sulfurous odors, not ammonia.

Other images show some of the other bombs found in the building including small blocks of C4 being removed from the rubble - along with narration by Jane Grahm of her encounters with people placing these explosives in the days before the bombing. (This testimony was extensively covered in issues of The New American.) There are interviews with the folks who heard and felt the structural explosives going off in the building many seconds before the truck bomb went off - a subject for which there is so much evidence that it is not feasible one DVD could cover it all. (The significance here is that there is no room in the official account for McVeigh to have had anything to do with making/stealing/buying/placing or controlling the detonation of the many additional bombs found in the building.  Since there is no room, there must have been significant numbers of others who remain unknown, and who have been protected by the willful ignorance of the official investigators.

Alas, if I have one criticism of this DVD it is that I wish it had more material about what an Oklahoma trooper found in Andy Strassmier's briefcase when his car broke down a few miles from Elohim City and was impounded. The briefcase contained documents that are essentially the ""truck bomb"" that explodes the Federal Governments mythological version of 9/11. Ambrose Evans Pritchard wrote about this subject in his fine book about the Clinton years. After knowing what was in that briefcase one simply cannot believe that Strassmier was anything but an undercover agent.  And thanks to BATF informant Carol Howe, we know Andy was suggesting blowing up Federal buildings...  The list of other agents, assets and informants at EC was so great that one wonders if ANYONE there was NOT a Federal agent.  The DVD then raises the question of whether McVeigh might himself have been working for the Feds.  There is some evidence that his sister thought he was.  If my memory serves, I think that the DVD also quotes Jane Grahm as saying that she recognized Andy Strassmier as one of the people she saw in the underground Murrah Building garage. If I am remembering that correctly, this is something I never read or heard elsewhere.  If so, and regardless of who McVeigh was or wasn't working for, it is unimaginable that Strassmier was anything besides an informant or provocateur. Had he been anything else, he would have been arrested, tried and probably executed along with McVeigh.

This DVD is essential for understanding not only the OKC bombing in 1995, but also the 9/11 events.  The person who was assigned to be Tim McVeigh's psychologist while in prison has lately been assigned to a similar role at our infamous Guantanamo Bay prison camp.  And this makes one wonder if prisoners can be induced to suppress parts of their testimony or fabricate others in order to prevent a patsy from declaring himself one, or to prevent him from outing the roles that other ""assets"" played.  Perhaps torture is used not only to attempt to get truth out of a prisoner, but to keep it in.  This is all speculation of course, but when one reads enough about the relationships between the Bush family and the bin Laden family, and about the CIA's role in building Al Queda, and their role in over-ruling Michael Springman to get the alleged 9/11 hijackers into the USA.... one grows very skeptical about the bin Laden 9/11 mythology and one wonders if the entire event was not fabricated in order to justify that which would otherwise have been unjustifiable.  In this vein, and for those who are NOT faint-of-heart, look up the new book on 9/11 by Christopher Bollyn titled Solving 9/11.  That book sheds light back on 9/11 the same way this DVD about the OKC bombing projects light onto the 9/11 events and how little Americans should trust the Federal government when they pretend investigate these history-shaping events.",1337472000,23,5800,4.937307297019527

4992600,5,B006J1OCHG,"The movie ""A Noble Lie"" arrived in the mail today and I just finished it.

WOW. It is an excellent film. I plan to invite others to see it and and look forward to watching it again (and yet again) as there is so much content I had never seen before - nor understood until now.

However, it is now obvious to me that the government story about the bombing of the Murrah Building is a total lie. This is the first time I have had access to really examine the pictures of the damage.

As to McVeigh's death - I still have nearly the same questions as before. We know for sure that he was a government agent. He made sure he attracted attention, was known to be ""extreme"", found and captured. A sting gone wrong? Given the facts, that's a stretch. McVeigh was ""executed"" by lethal injection - supposedly his body was not examined and he was almost immediately cremated. (Really, why the rush?)

I simply cannot believe that McVeigh is dead. He had to be rewarded for playing his part right up until the end. If his handlers had him killed - it would be very difficult for them to recruit others.

This film blew me away. It is very well done and I sat on the edge of my seat all the way through it.

It is the complicated tangle of lies need the propaganda of government ~ truth can always stand by itself. And this film goes a long way to spread some truth.

I hope a lot of people will see this - I'm spreading the word. I cannot wait for their second film to come out.",1330646400,10,1467,4.162544169611308

4992603,5,B006J1OCHG,"Only in a city with the strength of Oklahoma would you find an unrelenting thirst for truth and the proof to back it up.

I had never heard of this movie before.  The Oklahoma bombing happened so long ago, that while I remember when it happened I was still virginal in my thought that the government existed to protect it's people.  The people of the City of Oklahoma weren't willing to believe facts that didn't match up.  They signed a petition 12,000+ strong and demanded the Oklahoma bombing be researched not by an FBI owned by people with special interests, but those willing to consider ALL the information in an effort to present the truth to a public that demanded no less.  The results were startling.  What we see is a poorly manufactured story on the government's part with a lot of loose ends that were never tied up.  The one's that WERE tied up to prevent exposure were equally as sloppy.

This documentary should be a template for anyone who uses their cell phone camera to record the history going on around them on a day-by-day basis.  It shows where the government is most likely to cover-up evidence in the very earliest stages of ""false flag"" operations and how they go about the task of destroying evidence to control the story - even to the point of buying out media outlets who stick to the truth and firing their employees who searched for it.

The Oklahoma bombing now appears to be the precursor and chosen vehicle for swaying public opinion.  The Freedom of Information Act seems to point to the fact that false flag operations have been in force since the Johnson era, when the Gulf of Tonkin incident was used to justify going to war with Viet Nam according to newly released Presidential documents.  The last 10 minutes of this film lay it all out on the line.  We, the people, are responsible for what we allow the government to get away with and how many of our constitutional rights we give away with each year that passes.  It is because we do not speak up for accountability in our government that these false flag incidents continue.

Be informed, ask questions, and for God sake's watch this movie.  Be ready to record evidence as the nation's next false flag event unfolds and keep it to yourself until you find out who stands for justice and who stands for covering up the truth.  Remember, if the government would kill 19 innocent children and a law enforcement officer to keep the truth hidden, it will have no problem killing you.

8499138,5,B006J1OCHG,"Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  If you TRULY look at the situation with a open mind, and ask yourself ""is it possible""?  ""Who or what benefits""? Then and only then can you really form a subjective opinion.  I have lived in OKC from 16yrs old, to now turning 50 this year, heard and felt the explosion that morning, thought there was some ""rush"" at the time, but looking back now think I really just wanted someone to blame....  Watched this movie, and am blown away by the evidence, the ""what if's"", and the possibilities of government involvement.  Watch it, and decide for yourself people... but at least ask yourself - ""why can we not view the videos from cameras on the building, and from other views from different sources that shows the truck, McVeigh, and the explosion""?  There are so many ""why"" unanswered questions that the American people deserve to know.  It's been more than 20 years now - release the information being withheld..  until then, this is a scary and terrifying.  Forget the ""vital to national security"" excuse - show us the evidence and classified documents.  Its been so long ago - protecting ""national security"", or is it protecting a person or something else?  Open you mind, or your just wasting your time.. you decide.",1524182400,8,1258,4.751152073732719
