3729124,5,B001O7B5SY,"If you're looking for a DVD that will teach your how to use a kubotan or yawara in a realistic, self-defense situation, or you just want to know how to pronounce ""kubotan"" and ""yawara"" this is the DVD for you.

As a return customer of CFA, I can say with some authority this is one of the most comprehensive and approachable DVDs for beginners and novices that Mr. Franco has produced. But don't let my phrasing fool you: these techniques--though accessible to those that do not study martial arts--are none the less powerful and devastating to a criminal attacker.

A rundown of content in this DVD: description and application of a kubotan and yawara, the phases of a criminal assault (and how to incorporate the kubotan into those phases), strikes (multiple application), escapes from chokes, locks and holds using the kubotan, simulated street fighting drills with the incorporation of the kubotan and many tips, tricks and candid advice from Sammy Franco. It all comes together and makes sense when you watch it.

As always, the same high-quality material that I have come to expect from Sammy Franco's Contemporary Fighting Arts is present here. I firmly believe there is nothing else like it on the market.",1244073600,9,1213,4.907317073170732
3729125,5,B001O7B5SY,"Kubotans & Yawaras is a great DVD about an often forgotten and misused self defense tool. Contemporary Fighting Arts founder Sammy Franco has done a great job in showing how to use this small but powerful weapon in a safe, effective and efficient manner.
The DVD starts out by going over the purposes of the kubotan,different hand grips,and phases of combat. Then it moves on to subjects like stances, concealment, and targets and much more information after that.
Bottom line is that this is great product on how to properly use kubotans & yawaras. I was more than satisfied with this DVD.",1243468800,3,590,4.794117647058823
3729126,5,B001O7B5SY,"A kubotan is a very powerful self-defense tool that can be carried and employed by just about anyone, anywhere. The average citizen doesn't carry a gun, and you may not want to or be able to carry a knife. Well what about a ""keychain""?

Not only is it convenient and innocuous, but I can't overstate how powerful a self-defense tool a kubotan can be in application... if you know how to use it. This DVD may be a ""Quick & Dirty Guide"", but it opened my eyes to a means of defending yourself that has the capacity to end a physical altercation immediately and, amazingly, doesn't require a great deal of power or strength to employ.

It may not require strength, but it does require skill and training, and with this DVD you'll have all you need to get started on the path of mastering this fantastic tool.

What are the best way to hold the kubotan? How can you deploy it in the pre-contact phase before the fight begins without losing the element of surprise?  What are the best targets to strike? How do you train with a kubotan safely so as not to injure your training partner? Can it only be used as a striking tool, or does it have other uses? Can a kubotan be used in ground fighting? Or escaping from chokes and holds? A lot of these questions I'd have never thought to ask, but they're all answered here.

After watching this DVD, you'll be amazed at how useful and versatile a kubotan can be. And when you've seen one applied against both a body-opponent bag and a wood mannequin head and imagine what it could do to a criminal assailant, your respect for a 5 1/2 inch piece of aluminum will sky-rocket.",1243382400,10,1612,4.395973154362416

3729128,5,B001O7B5SY,"As with everything CFA and Mr. Sammy Franco produce, this HIGH QUALITY DVD is no exception---Realism, Efficiency, and NO B.S.!!  Anyone serious about protecting themself and loved ones needs to watch and learn. Hour video covers everything one needs to learn about this overlooked self-defense tool. Fits right onto a keychain and this DVD teaches you how to use it properly when it is legally justified.",1399939200,,404,5.121212121212121
3729129,4,B001O7B5SY,"I found several of the exercises and ""moves"" helpful.  Its not enough to just have the tool, you have to know how to use it.  It goes into several situations you may find your self in and how to escape.  Some of the moves I found completely impractical.  Like all things, take what you need and leave the rest.",1389571200,,310,4.203389830508475

3729131,3,B001O7B5SY,Not as good as I expected.  It covers what you need to know but I was hoping for something better.,1376092800,,98,3.9
3729132,4,B001O7B5SY,"I had mixed reviews reading some of the other reviews, but decided to order it anyway, since I have great respect for the author of this DVD. It was basically a beginners DVD, however it gives Instructors as myself a refresher course on things we can use to teach from. Would liked to have had more on the ""flail"" end where the keys go. I'd recommend this DVD for all beginners and experts. If you stop learning, you stop growing. A- from me.",1350950400,2,442,4.337349397590361
3729133,5,B001O7B5SY,"As long as you have your key ring on you you could have a kubotan on you. And if you use what you will learn in this DVD you will never be unarmed.

Kubotan is a non-lethal self defense tool that you could have on you at every moment, in emergency you could even improvise one with a pen.

The DVD is full of lessons and advice, from basic stance to reallity training in situ, along with target training and defensive tactic against submission. It is also well done, with crystal clear picture and soundband, and the chapters allow you to focus your training on what you need.

After watching this DVD and train with it, my pocket is now a little heaviest and my life safest.",1320192000,3,675,4.299212598425197
3729134,5,B001O7B5SY,"Kubotans & Yawaras

This dvd explains how to use the kubotan in a threatening situation .  The techniques are clearly explained and demonstrated.
It also pointed out the safety during exercise. The training is based on realistic situations and how to deal with them there.
No unnecessary techniques but effective methods to get yourself to safety. By means of flows several movements are practised.

A valuable dvd for those who want to train with a kubotan.",1320105600,3,458,5.0
3729135,5,B001O7B5SY,This DVD should be on the shelf of any serious martial artist or individual who is concerned about his or his families safety.  Mr. Franco goes into great detail and covers all the aspects need to become proficient with Kubotans and Yawaras.  I own plenty of CFA's DVDs and this is honestly one of the best.  I highley recommend this DVD!,1320019200,3,338,4.508196721311475
3729136,5,B001O7B5SY,"This DVD is a realistic training lesson on the practicality and use of the KUBOTON. It covers everything from the proper grip to various defense methods and procedures. It is good for anyone from the beginner who knows nothing of this defdense tool, to the experienced practicioner. I highly reccomend it.",1320019200,5,305,5.0
3729143,5,B001O7B5SY,"As a retired United States Marine with over 25 years in the MartiaL Arts I judge training very hard. If you have no experance or a seasoned veteran this kubotan and yawara will give what you need to master these weapons. It will teach you how to use a kubotan or yawara in a realistic, self-defense situation, and or train someone else if you ae looking for a good guide to boost up your training at your school/Dojo.

 I can say with some authority this is one of the most comprehensive DVDs I have came across in regards to the kubotan and yawara. The DVD was of high-quality,I have looked and found nothing else like it on the market.
You will not be disappointed, buy this DVD!!

3729144,4,B001O7B5SY,Good basics. Purchased two - one for a friend on active duty in Ashcanistan. You can use all the tools you can get hold of.,1320019200,2,123,3.96
3729145,5,B001O7B5SY,"In the real world, you are not going to overpower and outstrike everyone. this is where the Kubotan & Yawaras DVd comes in.  Mr. Franco delivers again with real world self defense that anyone can deploy. Excellent DVD.",1320019200,2,218,4.7368421052631575
3729146,3,B001O7B5SY,"The product was shipped quickly and arrived as advertised. However, as far as the content is concerned this feels like a bad first draft. There is some really good information but just getting through the first 20 minutes will be tough for anyone. Unnecessary repetition and long drawn out sections on simplistic concepts (i.e. a 4x's slow downed section of Sammy hitting a dummy over and over ad nauseam). For the novice of the kubotan there is a nice amount of techniques here, the presentation is just poor and leaves much to be desired.",1318723200,,540,4.75531914893617
3729147,5,B001O7B5SY,"I like this video, a lot.
Clear and to-the-point explanation, good picture quality, handy menus.
Nothing particularly fancy, but I got all I was looking for, hence the 5 stars.",1310515200,,176,4.9
3729148,4,B001O7B5SY,"This is all you would want for someone just looking into the kubotan and self defense. It points out the basics and show a little more, just enough that they understand the usability of such a efficient tool. But leaving out enough that after watching the video I felt the definite need for a trained professional to continue learning the kubotan.
  I understand what one reviewer said about segments. Watching one man pound a wooden head, or the B.O.B. gets old fast, but outside those two parts, the rest of the video is spaced well.
  Also what another viewer said, they should have left the Yawara out of the title. They have similar concepts but are significant enough to warrant more attention if your going to reference them. This is definitely a Kubotan video.

ON a side note, my case came damaged as it is a cheap jewel case for the DVD. Just be careful the teeth that hold the DVD centered aren't broken or they could scratch the disc.
Overall a good buy for an introduction to Kubotan concepts.",1304035200,,1006,4.566666666666666
3729149,3,B001O7B5SY,"The video fouses on one style of Kubotan,although the speaker does make the point that techniques translate to the Yawara stick, Contemporay fighting arts states that they custom make their Kubotans. The video goes through multiple techniques with the Kubaton, and although I can see value in having the demonstrators repeat techniques, I see little value in having to watch someone strike a manikin for over a minute with the same technique. Certainly thiswould be valuable if you were actually training, but the video is strictly a demonstration video. I feel that the the video could have been improved if Mr. Franco could find a system to engage the audience to a higher degree. After the demonstration, and equal amount of dvd time is spent promoting his other dvd topics. There are valuable techniques in this video using actual martial artists so I feel that this product could be helpful to those starting out with this weapon.",1283904000,6,935,4.961783439490445
3729150,4,B001O7B5SY,"I don't have enough martial arts experience to give an authoritative review of the techniques in this video. I speak only as an average guy looking for tools that he can use. From this perspective, I like this video well enough.

From what little I've learned of self-defense, there are no magic bullets. In a real situation, I'd either hit the targets accurately and effectively or I wouldn't. If I did, I'd have a chance but would not be guaranteed a good outcome. If I wasn't effective, I'd be hurt.

This video doesn't try to teach any magic, but the video gives the average person some ideas to have in mind. A big part of self-defense seems to be making some kind of attack on some worthwhile target. This video talks about places where one should direct strikes with a kubaton in various situations. The video talks about some pressure points, and the average person will understand those ideas as well.

As an average guy, I feel better about having watched this video. I'd strongly recommend that anyone getting a kubaton but not getting any other training should buy this video. On the other hand, my brief experience with Krav Maga tells me that practice with these specific techniques is the only real way to be proficient. If you can find a class taught by a good instructor who will go over kubaton use, I recommend the class as well. (In terms of how to find a good instructor, I'm sorry, but that's out of my league as well right now.)",1278720000,3,1451,4.551724137931035

3729152,4,B001O7B5SY,"Dear Friends,
After seeing the Kubotans & Yawaras DVD, I classify the same as a great opportunity of learning more some techniques on this defense instrument. Thanks to our master Takayuki Kubota, creator of Kubotan and its techniques, others could still develop more these techniques. Sammy Franco is one of these that shows us in this practical technical DVD that can be applied to our day-to-day without knowledge of any martial art. I suggest that Sammy Franco creates more a DVD with more techniques on Kubotan-Yawara. I recommend the purchase. All the best fo all!",1255910400,,570,5.010526315789473

8329801,3,B001O7B5SY,"Some of the techniques shown in the video are useful,  others are not. Holding  thekubotan in the ""high  position"" is  extremely awkward and too obvious during an actual encounter.

My biggest critisism of this video is that they should have shown the techniques in  slow  motion. While there is much  repetition of the techniques, they are mostly all in ""real time"" speed. My suggestion is to show the technique in sliw morion  first, then go regular speed.

Also, I found no practical use at all for the ""drills""  at the end of the video. They  look like some cheesy, orchestrated, old kung fu movie. That time could  have been better spent going over additional techniques.",1444953600,2,676,4.773913043478261
8329802,3,B001O7B5SY,"You really don't need a video to figure out how to strike someone with a Kubaton, but it's a great place to start.  Unfortunately, that's also where this video stops.  There is SO MUCH MORE you can do with a Kubaton, and the real beauty of the Kubaton is pressure points.  This video really doesn't show any of that.  For the most part, I found the video boring.  But it's a place to start for those that have no background on the subject.  Just don't stop here - there is much more to learn about this weapon that I affectionately refer to as my ""magic wand"".

Why do I refer to my Kubaton as a magic wand, you ask?  Because with a Kubaton in my hand I can make you do anything I want, and have you go anywhere I want.  And that's the real power of the Kubaton.

Bottom line, this video is a great place to start for the completely uneducated.  If you know how to strike a person with a Kubaton, move on to something else.  This will be too basic for you.",1438473600,2,956,4.080645161290323

Sammy shows you how to apply it in the street with power and to the right targets to stop the aggressor.  To the point and weel taught.  That's what I expect from his materials.
