I was very fortunate to have met Admiral James Stockdale in the early 80s when he and his wife Sybil published ""In Love & War"" as this book forever changed my life. As a result of Stockdale's book, I eventually procured every single book listed in the Library of Congress on the subject of Vietnam POWs. I could not get enough of what I felt the media completely avoided - namely the torture of our servicemen in Vietnam. Why, I asked, is the media giving this subject no attention? What I later learned answered my earlier question - the majority of these men survived years of torture by drawing on their faith in God... and we know how the media feels about God! In this wonderful DVD you get to listen in as these men discuss the daily life in a world you and I could not even begin to imagine - a world of daily torture, deprivation and solitary confinement. These men suffered in a way few people could imagine. And it wasn't for a period of a day, a week, or a month - it was, for many, a term of years! I only wish every single American could watch this DVD and listen to these men talk about their love of country and God and how they survived under conditions many of us would succumb to. This is a great DVD for every church in America to show their congregations. It is also a great motivator as one cannot help but be motivated and inspired by the stories of these men - truly the finest our country has to offer! These men returned to a country that was spitting on their servicemen. They had no parade... they had no one with open arms to thank them for their suffering...  they were in many ways disillusioned by what they came home to. I cannot imagine making the kind of readjustment these men were required to make. God Bless You All!",1323648000,2,1983,4.257294429708223

 service.  Freedom
