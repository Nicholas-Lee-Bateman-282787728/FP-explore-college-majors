Including ignoring the military security procedures, conspicuously travelling through high risk areas during broad daylight, and being cleared hot and/or fangs out for various reasons and in really bad parts of ""indian country."" By '07 parts of Baghdad were so overrun with insurgents that there were absolutely no friendlies within blocks.  But, these guys were all battle tested combat vets with years of tactical training and real world experience - and they chose to lay their lives on the line to support the mission of the State Department.  I've personally seen guys like this take a hit on their vehicle (right next to their head) and *still not fire back* because they couldn't ID the source. Its just completely unlikely that this team of professionals would just panic fire or freak out, nor would they yank a trigger responding wildly to some potshot either.  If they fired, it was for one of two reasons...  either they were fired on with sustained and effective fire, or they were ordered to do so - or both. Regardless of why, there was an extensive investigation into what happened  - their contracts with State made them accountable for literally every bullet fired.  And the results were that they were doing their job.

It's much more likely that the Iraqi nationals and police don't want to accept that their guys screwed up and fired on an armed convoy.

Yes, it's horrible and awful that anyone died, especially this young boy. But the Blackwater team endured all kinds of investigations over this incident, and it wasn't  their personnel that made the mistakes.  For myself personally it is my preference that this kind of firefight is happening in Baghdad and not in Philadelphia. And having PMC's WITH active duty combat experience is way better than without.  Once Blackwater exited, the vaccuum was filled by GI Joe wannabe's spraying lead and spreading violence with willful abandon and even less accountability.",1525651200,,2116,4.943502824858757
