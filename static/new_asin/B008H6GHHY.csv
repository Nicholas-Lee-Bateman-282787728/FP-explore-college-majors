I wonder what happened the quality of Disney moves.
They are not as good as they use to be.

5164265,5,B008H6GHHY,"My daughter is a big fan of baseball movies, and for Xmas she was hoping for a copy of the first movie. We elected to surprise her with this set instead. Of course she watched them all over the break, and due to her nature she found enjoyment in all of them. Her favorite is the original.

 Get all 4 for the price of 2, and save on packaging as they are held in one case.",1358035200,,372,3.8815789473684212

5164334,5,B008H6GHHY,"My daughter saw ""Angels in the Outfield"" at school and said she wanted to see the movie with me, so I bought this four-movie collection. The themes are appropriate for her age (she's 9 years old), wholesome, and funny. We've watched three out of four of the movies so far. Buying all four movies was a better value, too.",1433376000,,320,4.440677966101695

5164373,5,B008H6GHHY,"Excellent family movies - especially for small kids. Some are not quite as good as the original ""Angels in the Outfield"" (""Angels in the End Zone"" was rather ""Ho-Hum"" as it was almost a ""play-by-play"" rendition of the ""Outfield"" movie, only adapted for football as opposed to baseball), but all were entertaining & the price certainly was good, especially for all 4 movies. I especially liked the fact that each DVD was mounted on it's own backing plate, as opposed to all the DVD's being simply ""stacked"" on top of each other as some cheap-o producers are want to do nowadays! Well worth the price, I thought!",1408752000,7,610,4.710280373831775

5164375,5,B008H6GHHY,I like all the movies on this set. Thank you for doing this as it beats purchasing separately. I don't like word requirements on this.,1400112000,2,134,4.4

5164387,5,B008H6GHHY,"can't wait to watch the other 3 movies, as i've only seen the first Angels in the Outfield.  It's a great movie about foster care for elementary age foster children in non-permanent placements.",1399680000,,193,4.848484848484849

5164392,4,B008H6GHHY,"But the other three must have been made for the Disney Channel.  They are very ""mediocre""...at best. Kids will probably like them.
The 4-pack is still a good value since it cost about the same as a single of Angles in the Outfield (the one we really wanted.)

If you like Angles in the Outfield I would recommend it. You might like the others too.",1388880000,,347,4.323076923076923
5164393,4,B008H6GHHY,This set of movies I have seen before and thought that they would make a good addition to the family library.  Disney Movies are very entertaining and have a good feeling that goes with them.,1381708800,2,191,4.457142857142857
5164394,5,B008H6GHHY,"This is another great selection of Disney Family Movies that can be enjoyed again and again. I bought this one mainly for ""Angels in the Outfield"" as I remembered it as a heartwarming story of 2 young foster boys who never gave up believing in miracles, and a temperamental coach of a losing baseball team, played by Danny Glover. The team are the ""Angels"", a bumbling lot who are in desperate need of a win and, in answer to the oldest boy's prayer, are actually rescued by a group of angels from above. The head angel, ""Al"", is Christopher Lloyd, who plays the part perfectly. I especially enjoyed the graphics of the heavenly ""Angels"" and also, the musical score of the movie. The climax of it almost brought tears to my eyes, just as it did many years ago. Ok, so I'm a sentimental soul who rather watches some clean family entertainment than all the bloody and gorey violence presented in most of todays movies.
One thing I don't understand: the 4 movies are listed on Amazon as ""1 disc"" yet I received  a set of 4, beautifully packaged and labeled. I expected a 2-sided disc with 2 movies on each side so this was a pleasant surprise. I'm in the process of checking out some more of the Game-Changers Movies from Disney because the prices are more than reasonable.
BTW - I also watched ""Angels in the Endzone"", another good story, with Christopher Lloyd again as ""Al"". Next up: ""Angels in the Infield"" and ""The Perfect Game"". I have a feeling these won't disappoint neither!",1367020800,8,1480,4.56390977443609

8528100,5,B008H6GHHY,This is one of the very best collections of Disney movies that anyone can afford as you don't get one but Four great movies that you will enjoy watching many times as the are non tiring films that let you see more about the movie each time as the action is jammed packed in each film.  I've watched each of these movies myself a doszn times each and they are movies I'll want to watch again and again.  Really buy DVDs that won't just sit on the shelf,1482278400,,451,4.113636363636363
