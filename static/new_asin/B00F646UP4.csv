8612603,5,B00F646UP4,"This live concert was recorded when Jason Waldrup was still Greater Vision's tenor.  All of the personnel lineups of Greater Vision have been beyond excellent, but to me at least, there was something very special about the group during the Waldrup years, which is why I treasure this DVD.  At the time they were promoting their Perfect Candidate CD.  The set list is....
Use Us, Jesus
You Gotta Know
There Is
He;s Still Waiting by the Well
No One
So Much God
Merciful to Me
I Believe
O Holy Night
My Name is Lazarus
You'll Carry Me Through
God Wants to Hear You Sing

Of course, there are funny stories from Gerald, as well.  You can never go wrong with a Greater Vision concert DVD.",1465516800,,683,4.432
