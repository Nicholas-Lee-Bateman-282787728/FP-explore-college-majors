8005176,4,B00011RHNQ,"This two-disc package is a great buy. It contains a smorgasbord of great goals and game highlights, with informative and interesting insights from many of the coaches and key players involved in the games. I've watched it and rewatched it several times, with undiminished pleasure. (I have only one quibble. To my mind, Bergkamp's superbly acrobatic goal--ranked as the second best of the first decade--is far more impressive than Beckham's long-range--and rather lucky--effort, which is ranked as the best of the decade.)",1231286400,,522,5.378048780487805

8005178,4,B00011RHNQ,This is a great item to remember the first decade of the English Premier League. It has 2 dvd's put into 1 that show us all the great goals and the top 18 matches of the first decade of electrifying action. I don't have any critisim of the great goals disk but the great matches could have had more action instead of just the goals. If they couldn't make this dvd longer than maybe they could get rid of some of the talking. I agree with the greatest goal by David Beckham and the greatest match of the decade contested between Newcastle and Liverpool. Bechamas chip from half way was awsome and Newcastle vs. Liverpool was the most exciting match i've ever seen because there was alot on the line and it had great action and great goals. There should have been more than 2 Chelsea matches seem I am a Chelsea fan. If you are a true soccer fan buy this DVD now!!GO CHELSEA!!!!! WE ARE GOING TO WIN IT THIS YEAR,1089676800,16,910,4.265895953757226
