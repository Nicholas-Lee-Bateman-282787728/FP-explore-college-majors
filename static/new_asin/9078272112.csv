1172420,5,9078272112,"Quality video photography and nature sounds give you a true winter experience without the cold.  This is one of my favorite dvds.  I own many nature and ambient dvds and I have found that these by Tony Helsloot and Isis Visual are by far the best.  This is really a great winter dvd, that even features the howling mountain winter winds sound in one of the scenes.  Great job another quality World Nature Video/Isis Visual dvd by Tony Helsnoot.  I highly recommend this one if you are a fan of winter.  Variety of winter scenes and sounds.  Great for meditation and relaxation.",1383177600,2,577,4.598039215686274
1172421,5,9078272112,"I love ambient DVDs!  I work from home, and I find my creativity and focus boosted by DVDs with natural sights and sounds.  This one shows beautiful video of the Alps in Austria (my dream place of residence!), Switzerland, and Italy.  There are staggering views of snow-capped mountains, melting glaciers, clouds drifting across a winter-cold sky, and the sun shining on snowy hills.  I live in the Arizona desert, and sometimes I very much want to experience the beauty of a crisp, cold winter's day.  This DVD allows me to do that without traveling anywhere (or buying appropriate winter clothing!)  Sound and video are high quality.  DVD repeats automatically to allow seamless playback and all-day peace.  The sounds of wind, lapping lake water, and dripping melt-off are soothing and invigorating all at once.  This DVD gives my mind and spirit rest and helps me feel less tense.",1383177600,5,884,4.959183673469388

7901244,5,9078272112,"No doubt about it - Winter is a spectacular visual delight - with this gorgeous video, I can enjoy the sights and sounds without freezing! The photography is absolutely beautiful and now that it's finally Spring, I can enjoy it all!! The snow-capped peaks, the frozen waterfall, even the sound of the wind whistling. It's all here and while I love it now, I know I'll REALLY love it when the hot summer gets here. Great job all around.
Thanks!",1428710400,,443,4.55

7901247,5,9078272112,"Put a sweater on for this DVD, because the sound of the wind and the falling of the snow will make you and yours huddle before the television with delight. This DVD will take you to remote snow covered valleys and mountain peaks that you will probably never, in the course of your life, see for yourself. The scenes are exquisite. The snow is un-troddenno footprintsso you feel like an explorer, but of a strange and beautiful snowy planet, from which the Sun seems like the star it really is, and where the clouds build up before your eyes to hide a towering mountain peak. Mountain climbers often return from the summit with a faraway look in their eyes. You will have that look in your eyes, too, after experiencing this breathtaking excursion into the various and beautiful stages of Winter. -Dan",1391212800,,800,4.640845070422535
7901248,1,9078272112,THis is not at all what I expected.  Would not recommend it.  It cost too much money just to hear water running!!!,1389225600,,114,4.136363636363637
7901249,5,9078272112,This dvd is spectacular...the scenes are so tranquil and beautiful. There is a relaxation section with three extra tracks...the frozen waterfall is so amazing...with pastel colors and cascading water...a stunning sight. A very fun dvd that will bring your body temperature down in the hot summer months. I highly recommend this dvd to everyone...:),1388016000,,348,5.462962962962963
7901250,5,9078272112,"I love the natural sounds of the artic winds and running water.  It is so very relaxing.  When you are in a festive sprit, the images pair well with some Christmas music.  But I have used it most for just relaxation because I love the natural sounds.  There are many DVD's out there with ocean, rain, thunder, forest etc., but this is the 1st that has the steady soothing sound of the Aritc Wind.  Enjoy!",1386633600,3,404,4.333333333333333
