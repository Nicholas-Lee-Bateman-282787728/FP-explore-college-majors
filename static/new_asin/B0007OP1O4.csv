8049627,3,B0007OP1O4,"Ghost Town Law, 1942 film

This is set in Pickwick, Nevada, founded July 4, 1880 by Neil Pickwick. He discovered the Lucky Hunch Mine. [An owner-operated business, not a Big Corporation.] Trespassers are banned. Tumbleweeds are in the street, this town has been abandoned. This ghost town is a natural hide-out for outlaws. US Marshals are trailing a wanted man. The outlaws go masked outside of town. A covered well is a secret entrance. Two Marshals follow a man. There are shots. In Washington a man talks about two bodies found in the desert. Luke Martin is asked to guide a young lady to Pickwick to search for her brother. Sandy Hopkins visits and old friend. Tom Cook ranch foreman questions him. They are suspicious of strangers. A US Marshal visits to investigate the missing marshals.

Nell Pickwick built a grand house before the mining money ran out. Miss Hall inherited this property. A man stumbles through the door! He has lost his memory but has gold in his saddlebags, a small fortune. [Water is almost as valuable there.] Who is this stranger? Miss Hall is loaned a revolver. There is trouble. Marshal McCall leaves at night. Somebody warns Miss Hall to leave or else! There is a fight in another room. The intruder rides away but is chased. He went that way. Miss Hall and the Judge will return to Sundown in the morning. Hopkins meets McCall and tells what he found. Then Buck arrives with new information. They plan to search the mine. Luke and Miss Hall also search the mine - until they are captured! Sandy sits by the well, then falls in!

Does the Judge have a hidden agenda? There are gunshots and a chase. The Rough Riders follow the outlaws, who double back to retrieve the hidden bullion at the Pickwick house. They are caught by the Rough Riders. Theyve done it again, right on schedule says a man. The Sheriff takes away the bad guys. The Rough Riders go their separate ways, until they meet again.

This used the plot where an Establishment authority was in cahoots with the outlaws. This happened in the Wild West days, could it still occur in todays world? Does money buy influence among officials? The idea of sudden unearned wealth is a dream for many who throw their money away on lottery tickets. Those who gain by exploiting peoples dreams are the sure winners.",1404604800,,2300,4.657635467980295
8049628,5,B0007OP1O4,"My husband was really thrilled when he received this for Christmas. Buck Jones was his favorite Western hero when he was a kid, and he thought he'd never see Buck again.",1369440000,,169,4.483870967741935
8049629,5,B0007OP1O4,"This is probably the best, or at least the fan favorite ROUGH RIDERS entry of the series. We have Buck Roberts, Tim McCall and Sandy Hopkins ( our heroes ) drift into town seperately, as usual, to interact with the other cast members in order to solve the mystery killings and goings-on at the ghost town/ abandoned mine. Lots of cobwebs, hidden passages and a spooky old gothic mansion highlight the proceedings. It really has the feel of a 1940's Monogram horror film and one half expects either George Zucco or Bela Lugosi to be the mastermind behind it all. Lots of old time movie fun here with action-packed gunfights and fistfights as well. A great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. And the ALPHA dvd is one of the best I've seen for a ROUGH RIDERS feature, nice and clear, easy to watch......major bad guys to watch for include Tom London, Ben Corbett and of course, everybody's favorite, Charlie King, who gets whupped on good by Buck!",1320796800,,944,4.625
8049630,5,B0007OP1O4,"Loved this movie from the Rough Riders Buck Jones, Tim McCoy and Raymond Hatton, the interaction between the stars are what makes this and the other Rough Rider movies great",1261872000,,173,4.8
8049631,5,B0007OP1O4,"It would be hard for me to write an objective review of any Buck Jones movie because he is in my eyes a real life American hero.  This was for my father who used to walk, as a boy, into town to the theater to see Buck on the silver screen.  Based on my father's reaction to getting this movie I have to assume it is a five star video.  Hope you enjoy watching Buck as much as my dad.",1193443200,2,383,3.7625
