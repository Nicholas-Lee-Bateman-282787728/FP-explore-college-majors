1634093,1,B00005NGT4,"First off we find it pretty amazing (not in a good way) that this is only the third review done for a film made in 1974, both being within the last 3 years. For most that is a warning sign to steer clear. However for Sid that's what draws us in. Sure it doesn't make sense to most, but the quest for b often brings you to films of this caliber and sometimes gives you a classic. This was not one of those times. When you take gambles you also open yourself up to some big let downs and Drive in Massacre is one of those we'll hope to never see again.

The film begins in the typical grainy 70's look as the sunsets and the local drive in opens up. Once the film starts rolling a couple looking to get a little randy winds up getting killed by a sword yielding maniac. Hey Dutch! It's the exact sword that pear shaped loser used to have. Anyway, this alerts two dim witted old investigators (one resembling John Madden) and they hit the scene of the crime. From here one out the film goes absolutely nowhere. It's pretty much the same scene over and over leaving you amped to hit the fast forward button quite often.

So to Sum up Drive-In Massacre: stay away! Even if you're a huge fan of b, this will leave you virtually nothing to find enjoyment in. See for Sid we were born past the drive in times and never got to enjoy what seemed to be a great experience. Naturally you'd think it would make for a great horror atmosphere, but this one proved to be the contrary. In the world of b horror we like to try and broaden our horizons by finding some more obscure films from older time periods. This one was came up empty but that will never stop Sid. This one never would have made it back in the days and easily would have gotten passed up to watch Cow Tipping for a 5th time in one sitting.",1253750400,4,1792,4.146551724137931
1634094,2,B00005NGT4,"Two grande detectives are on the trail of a sword wielding killer who strikes at the local drive-in.  A few suspects and a few red herrings are thrown our way, but they're not terribly effective.
Honestly, I'm not going to waste my time talking about this one much.  It's better to just avoid it unless you simply can't help yourself.  As a slasher it wasn't very good, nor as a mystery or homage to the drive-in.  The picture looks like a dreadful VHS transfer, but I doubt a clearer picture would really make the film better.
A few good kills in the very beginning, but that's about it.  We all know I love low budget trash, but sometimes I have my limits.",1241827200,2,658,4.360655737704918
1634095,1,B00005NGT4,"I watched this film on the belief that is was notoriously gory, what a mistake I made. I can't begin to describe how mediocre the film is, it has so many wretched traits.  Make no mistake about it, I love trash cinema and manage to enjoy movies that many viewers dismiss as ""mindless"" and ""plotless"". This movie is one I can find NOTHING good about. It is a total waste of time. The script and acting is mind numbing, the gore effects are horrible and there is really nothing redeeming or interesting in this movie. Its 76 or so minute run time takes way too long. The ending is one of the biggest jokes ever, nothing is revealed as to who the killer is, nothing at all. I could go on but by now you get the idea. Take it from me it's TRASH!

Trust me, if you think movies like ""3 on a meathook"" are garbage, you have not seen anything yet until you witness Drive In Massacre. Watch it under heavy intoxication if you must see it. I really feel this is one of the worst film any genre has ever offered. This is one of the worst movies ever made.

Worth a watch only for the mediocre factor.",1211673600,,1090,4.156398104265403

Some really gruesome deaths, a nice, easy and unconfusing plot-- typical slasher film. The film introduced a few suspects, and even a plot twist, which was pretty easy to guess. A couple pretty awesome kills, and the run time was a mere 70 minutes.

[the bad]

The acting was pretty bad, camera work sub-par, dialogue lacked, which made it pretty typical for the genre.

[final thoughts]

Regardless of bad this film really was, and how much people seem to hate it, I really liked it. It did have bad acting, bad camera and bad writing, but it was a nice and solid slasher. It was released in 1976 and I think they did pretty will with the gore for that time. The deaths in the opening scene were the best and by far the bloodiest, but all of the rest still delivered. George ""Buck"" Flower co-wrote this movie and starred in an uncredited role, which brought a smile to my face.

I think it is a must own for any fan of the slasher movie, and really, if you hate the movie it's only 70 minutes long (uncut) so, why not check it out?",1136246400,11,1047,4.316326530612245

7947234,2,B00005NGT4,"DRIVE-IN MASSACRE (1976) Begins w/ a panning shot of the empty drive-in, followed by wonky, twangy rock music. As the patrons roll in, we are introduced to Mr. Johnson, the cantankerous manager of this gravel-covered venue. So far, it's just another night at what was once one of America's favorite make-out spots. Suddenly, a mannequin reaches for a speaker-box, and it's rubber head is lopped off! With a sword! Ketchup spills in the light of the moon. The mannequin's girlfriend is soon killed as well! Police are baffled. Upon their visiting the surly Mr. Johnson, they probably wonder why he's been spared. This guy really hates people, especially young people! Then there's Germy, the ""half-wit"" clean-up man. Coincidentally, Germy used to be a sword-swallower. Johnson hates him too! Another night brings cars full of movie-watchers, apparently oblivious to the bloody goings-on just hours earlier. An arguing couple turns amorous. After hearing them converse, we yell at the screen, ""Where the hell's that sword guy?!"". Oh my stars! The annoying couple is shish kebabbed! There is a god, after all! Astonishingly, in spite of the carnage, the drive-in remains open for business! The cops are even more puzzled. They question a suspect / witness. Dullness drags on. A pointless foot-chase. We notice a real lack of sword-swinging about now. Another evening, and the deadly drive-in is packed! Don't these people watch the news? Yet one more couple is featured. Johnson stands near the snack bar, hating them. Topless-ness occurs, followed by more senseless swordplay. Brought in for questioning, Johnson insults everyone, dressed in Joseph's Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat! Boy, does he hate cops! A lengthy, unrelated scene unfolds, concerning a local machete murderer (George ""Buck"" Flower!). Then, back at the drive-in, horror happens, as the semi-twist, non-ending takes place. What was this all about? Let's not think about it too much. Johnson hates that...",1518480000,,1969,5.314102564102564
7947235,1,B00005NGT4,"Killings are happening at a Drive-in , located somewhere in California. The police have three suspects who are quite the characters making this into a cheese/camp film.

The killing is all done by someone who sneaks in a sword and is able to walk around the drive-in with one.  The original quality of the film was never good. It is about a D+ on most DVDs. Consider a Blu-Ray if you desire B quality for a B film.

The film was designed to show at Drive-ins to create a false idea that there is a killer stalking couples at said place.

7947238,1,B00005NGT4,"This movie is dead slow, overly yappy, and wholly without suspense and/or tension.  They waste the best murder straight off and have nothing to show for it from that point on.  Worse, the so-called massacre involves a few couples only, hardly what one would classify as carnage on any level.  Plus, they are few and far between, which required a great deal of 'acting' from the few cast members to fill in the remainder of the time.  Let me tell you, no one from this cast ever became a star.  The acting involved was so imperceptible that it was practically subliminal!  As for the camera work, whoever was in charge left the darn thing parked more often than not, few edits were involved, the whole thing felt static.  The score was odd to say the least, half the time it was just noise for the sake of noise.  And the ending was definitely a cop out.

And utter waste of time and money.",1363996800,,889,4.404907975460123

A middle aged creepy pervert truck driver who has naked pictures of girls all over his living room. He didn't kill anybody but he loves to beat his meat. A drive in with some old retired carny characters and a fugazi retard that would make Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller, Sean Penn, John Malcovich, Cuba Gooding, Juliette Lewis and the franks and beans guy from Something About Mary stand and ovate. Probably the worst pretend mentally challenged person in the history of cinema.

7947242,1,B00005NGT4,"Young couples get killed in a California drive-in theater by a killer with a sword. Two cops investigate the murders and interview the manager of the theater and the very stupid assistant, former carnival sword swallower.

""Drive in Massacre"" is a very talky movie. Most of it is pointless, bad dialogue. There are some murder scenes but no suspense. The cops follow up all sorts of false leads but the plot moves nowhere. Even though the movie is only 74 minutes long it feels very long and is padded with scenes that have little or nothing to do with the main plot.

I like B movies when they're entertaining, but ""Drive in Massacre"" is just plain bad with no redeeming values or entertainment value. It's not ""so bad it's good"". In fact I think it might be one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen.
