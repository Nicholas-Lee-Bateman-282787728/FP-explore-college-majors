3908773,5,B002D1XKB0,"I watched Primeval Series Three, hoping that it would be as great as the first two series. And it turned out to be just as good as the other two series! We get some great new human characters and cool creatures, in this third series. Sadly, the last episode of series three, leaves us with a cliffhanger ending!

Hopefully, when the movie version of Primeval hits theaters, we will get to find out what happens to Abby, Connor, and Danny. But, for now, we'll just have to wait and see. The DVD set contains all ten episodes of Series Three. The episodes are listed below and contain spoilers.

PRIMEVAL SERIES THREE

Episode One- An exhibition of ancient Egyptian relics comes to the British Museum and an anomaly opens in a mysterious monument called the `Sun Cage'. A Pristichampsus, believed in Ancient Egypt to be the demon Ammut, emerges and proceeds to wreak havoc in London. Cutter, Abby, and new head of security Captain Becker pursue it through the city while Connor and new recruit, the Egyptologist, Sarah Page try to block off the anomaly and prevent more Pristichampsus from coming through. Meanwhile, Lester encounters a new adversary: the ambitious Christine Johnson.

Episode Two- Three teenage boys break into a house and a Future Gremlin attacks them. Only one boy manages to escape. With the anomaly closed, the Gremlin remains stuck in the house for the next 14 years, by which time Cutter's model has led him to predict that another anomaly will appear in that very house. He sends Connor, Abby and Jenny to investigate but the three have a run-in with the creature and PC Danny Quinn, who is trying to find out who murdered his brother.

Episode Three- An anomaly opens in a London hospital, causing several Diictodon to emerge. They promptly chew through the power cables cutting the power to the building. Cutter, Abby, Connor and Becker arrive to investigate as does journalist Mick Harper, who wants to get evidence of the creatures to expose to the public. Meanwhile, Helen, ""The Cleaner"" and their clone of Cutter infiltrate the ARC so that they can ask the real Cutter about the mysterious artifact. When the real Cutter returns Helen confronts him, informing him that she has to stop the ARC's research from destroying the world at any cost...even if it means killing her husband.

Episode Four- Mick Harper steals an anomaly detector from Jenny's car and uses it to track down an anomaly at an airport, bringing Nigel Marven with him to identify the creature, yet when a Giganotosaurus comes through the anomaly, the team has to not only stop the dinosaur destroying an airport and a Boeing 747, but also stop the journalists from broadcasting its existence to the world. Luckily for the team, they have unexpected assistance from Danny Quinn, who manages to lure the creature back to its own time.

Guest appearance by Nigel Marven

Episode Five- Danny Quinn is drafted in to help the team when a fast-growing flesh-eating fungus from the future is transferred to the present by a businessman's assistant, who in turn passes the spores onto his employer, Sir Richard Bently. Bently slowly turns into a Fungus Creature as a result. The team manages to bring the creature back to the ARC, where Jenny is trapped in the main control room with it and forced to fight for her life. After her recent discovery of Cutter's picture of Claudia Brown and her near-death experience, Jenny decides that she's had enough: she resigns from her job at the ARC, leaving the team in Danny's hands.

Episode Six- When the ARC is taken over by Christine Johnson and the military in search of the artifact, Danny and the team flee to a safehouse in the woods: in truth, an old cabin that has been abandoned since the 1930s. With no technology or weapons but their own resourcefulness, the team not only have to defend themselves from Johnson's soldiers, but also a pack of carnivorous Terror Birds that emerge from a nearby anomaly.

Episode Seven- A Dracorex comes through an anomaly, trying to escape from a 14th century knight who believes he is hunting a dragon. The team are forced to find and save the life of the Dracorex, and return the confused knight to his own world before he kills anyone, out of belief they are demons.

Episode Eight- An anomaly opens at a race car test track and a Megopteran, a insect from the future, comes through. It is carnivorous and lethal, and the team must draw on all their resources to get it back to its home. However, things get complicated when Jack decides to find out what his sister Abby really does for a living, and inadvertently drives through an anomaly into a future world inhabited by future predators. The team must now make a dangerous search mission to the future to rescue Jack, then escape with their lives.

Episode Nine- The team have to deal with a herd of Embolotherium from the Eocene. Danny arrives with a mysterious woman called Eve who he first saw in the Future; having rescued her from Christine Johnson, they endeavour to save everyone from the stampede. Upon their return to the ARC, the team are shocked to discover that Eve is Helen Cutter in disguise, who takes Johnson hostage. Holding her at gunpoint, Helen steals the artifact and vows once again to stop the ARC's research destroying the world. Helen then leaves Johnson in the future, where she is torn apart by a future predator, and makes her escape. The team decide they must find and stop Helen before more people die as a result of her actions.

Episode Ten- Danny, Abby and Connor travel to the future in pursuit of Helen while Sarah and Captain Becker try to evade Megopterans rampaging through Johnson's old headquarters. Meanwhile, the trio discover Helen plans to prevent the evolution of humanity in order to save the world, resulting in a chase across Cretaceous North America and into Pliocene Africa. Danny confronts Helen at the location of the human ancestor, Australopithecus, only to find she has poisoned a small number already. A Deinonychus that followed Danny through the anomaly charges at Helen and knocks her off a cliff, killing them both. Danny then makes his way back to the anomaly, only to have it close in front of him. Trapped in the past and separated from each other, will Danny, Abby and Connor ever get home?

This set is worth the price range of around $26.00-$29.00. The episodes are great and the action and drama blends well with one another. If you liked the first two series of Primeval, then you will also enjoy this set! Primeval is a great series, and I can't wait for the movie adaptation!

So, my advice, buy this set! It's worth every penny!",1250294400,23,6631,4.743923611111111

Absolutely, and great ones throughout. Oddly enough it even has enough relational/emotional content for the ladies to enjoy it to some degree.

A bit strong on the dundering and secretive aspects of the government in the series, but that isn't a key element of the show. The characters are fun to watch,

Much better effects than the campy Dr Who.",1467590400,,367,4.825396825396825

3909015,4,B002D1XKB0,"This season was good and opened up a lot more stuff happening with the characters.  I don't get the thing with Claudia Brown disappearing at the end of Season 1 and then coming back in as a character in Season 2.  Hated to see the the end of Steven, but I guess that's what keeps the show fresh.  Again, Helen Cutter's role in the scheme of things is baffling to me.",1465948800,,366,4.126760563380282

3909036,5,B002D1XKB0,"I first ran across this show on Netflix a few years back and loved it. While there are parts where the science geek in me has to suspend reality, it is a great fantasy world to get lost in. Great casting, gripping story lines and awesome CGI animals. The only point of the entire series I don't like is Helen, but that's just me.

When the program was no longer offered on Netflix (angry face to BBC) I decided that I would start ordering the DVD sets. Well worth the expense in my opinion. I will certainly be getting the rest of the collection over the next couple of months. But I know what I'll be binge watching this weekend.",1465344000,,630,4.25

They jumped the shark when they somehow developed a system for predicting anomalies by estimating the appearances of mythic creatures in mythic history and projecting new anomalies down to hour and street address. Big miss.",1465257600,,272,5.348837209302325

3909064,5,B002D1XKB0,Like the season 2 changes Was new at first because of character adjustments but it ll became cohesive as the season progressed. Good series too bad they were not given more episodes for each season,1464739200,,197,4.6571428571428575
3909075,5,B002D1XKB0,"Primeval is an adventure with decent special effects and better stories and character development than many sci-fi TV shows. It has elements of Jurassic Park and an interesting story, which makes you want to continue watching it. But perhaps most importantly, in my opinion, it features plenty of lesser-known prehistoric animals, including the Troodon. It also features some animals from the future, which are really creative and unique. Overall, Primeval is one of the best television series of all time.",1464739200,,506,5.3375
3909076,4,B002D1XKB0,Yes!  This season is actually better than the first and very entertaining along the lines of Dr. Who.  They have done an excellent job of keeping the story fresh and developing characters beyond their initial stereotypical personalities.,1464652800,,237,5.378378378378378
3909077,5,B002D1XKB0,It's a great plot I'm sorry it ended would love to keep watching,1464652800,,64,4.0
3909078,3,B002D1XKB0,"Interesting premise: fractures in space-time create portals into the past from which dinosaurs emerge to wreak havoc on local populations. Investigations are handled by a ""scientific"" team working under government control. The lead scientist, Nick Cutter, plays his part well with a serious earnestness in keeping with the campy premise. The others do not fare so well. The bumbling grad student with the romantic IQ of a 9-year-old, the silent but strong and fashionably-dressed senior assistant and the peroxide-blonde, Doc-Marten clomping lizard specialist, all add up to the reasons why this show was probably cancelled. Add to that the comings and goings of the overly sultry Mrs. Cutter, who had discovered the time rifts 8 years ago and disappeared and who now reappears to give red herrings and warn of imminent dangers in the aid of helping the plot line, and you have a grandiose train wreck. Still, it's an enjoyable monster series",1464652800,,942,5.163398692810458

3909097,4,B002D1XKB0,Nice twist to the first series and the few characters that survived the first season seem to be more comfortable with their roles and the new players fit in well. Well written save the formulaic search scenes dark-quiet-slow THEN ugly lizard eats someone. All the bad guys are super human. and BTW the supposed SAS guy would have made the shot and killed the bloke and saved the girls but that would mean the writers would have to create another villain.,1464480000,,454,4.617283950617284

3909154,3,B002D1XKB0,We loved season 1. Season 2? Not so much although we will watch it. I think the switch in certain characters and situations was totally unnecessary and the paradox presented was not addressed anywhere either in season 1 or 2...so far. It needs to be. It's worth watching just the same.,1463702400,,285,4.607843137254902

3909284,5,B002D1XKB0,"The series is centered in London where there are ""Anomalies"" or breaches in time.  These can be to the distant past or even the future.  These breaches allow creatures to pass through.  To deal with with these events the government has set up an agency called ARC.  Season 2 starts with head scientist Alex Cutter dealing with a space time paradox that only he remembers the previous continuity especially the fact that Claudia Brown has ceased to exist and the Season 2 goes from there.  It solidifies the notion that changing the past can mess up the present.  One thing that remains consistent is the use of the Wilhelm Scream effect in almost every show.  As I said it's a British series so a season only has 8 or 10 episodes and it is free with Amazon Prime so it is easy to binge watch.  I really liked this series.  It's fun to watch.",1461283200,,841,4.409090909090909

3909378,4,B002D1XKB0,"The show speeds along nicely. Has intrigue in the story arch and alternate timeline twists that remind me of 'Eureka'. I took away 1 star because of its incessant Hitchcockian fascination with birds in flocks and crawling critters. Some viewers may find the heavy accents a bit of a barrier. It's an improvement on season 1 with many love plots, that make you want to see what's going to happen next. The creature effects are satisfying enough and depart from textbook stereotypes, which I find refreshing",1418601600,,505,4.883720930232558

I loved it when it was first on television, and was overjoyed to be able to watch it again-- and having the perk of ""no extra charge"" because of Amazon Prime made it affordable to watch it. The concept of creatures from other eras appear in the ""now"" is fascinating all on its own--but for the stories to be as compelling as they are because of the characters IN the stories!",1417305600,,403,4.315789473684211

3909469,5,B002D1XKB0,"Frist of all, the common sense.  I've never seen a less sensible, more moronic bunch of lovable geniuses in my life.  Sure, they're smart, but if any one of them (but Abby) was given a common sense test, they'd fail miserably.  They go unarmed into unbelievably dangerous situations, and ditto for going into such situations without backup.  And Connor... lad, get your brain in charge of your hormones, and stop messing around!  You love Abby, so get on with it.

And Helen Cutter.  I tell you, if I had been any member of that team, by the end of the first series I would have taken any chance I had to shoot Helen, or cut her throat, or blow her up, or any other way of disposing of such a waste of human skin and good, breathable air.

3909510,5,B002D1XKB0,"The one thing I like about this series is that while you can watch them out of order it's better not to, one of the strengths of Primeval is the way that the new season builds off of the previous season and for that reason I recommend watching them in order to keep track of the characters and events that are occurring. This season picks up where season one ends and goes from there. I have to admit that all of the seasons available on Amazon Prime are permanent fixtures on my watch list. Season two is every bit as good as season one and adds a new twist to the show. I highly recommend this show and season to all sci fi fans especially if you are into time travel!

The special effects are so good.  Hard to believe it is a series sometimes.  The FX are worthy of a box office movie.  We are already on Season 3.

the constant drama and threat of prehistoric animals.

3909588,4,B002D1XKB0,"So the ARC team travels through an anomaly to what looks like an island of city ruins surrounded by ""crater"" (for lack of a better term).  There they encounter this pack of carnivores determined to add them to their recommended daily allowance of protein. And not just a couple, but a whole passel of these critters.  So, the question is, what do these future psycho-killers regularly dine on?  They do seem pretty healthy and well-fed. Do humans and/or animals frequently wander through multiple anomalies?  Is there a gigantic underground bunker with a never-ending supply of MREs?

I can usually roll with a story, like with all of the supposed problems of actual time travel. But the food thing, combined with the fact that the ARC team seems to lack common sense by re-visiting this place totally unprepared kinda disappoints me. If I had to go back in that hell-hole a second time I'd be carrying more than a few small arms and concussion grenades, and at least wearing long sleeves and Kevlar!",1380412800,,1000,4.790697674418604

The story lines have ongoing threads, unexpected turns & twists and a lot of maneuvering by people and agencies who have their own agendas regarding the ""anomolies"" that open portals to other times and places.

3909601,5,B002D1XKB0,"Primeval is a show where portals to the past and future open up and allow anyone or anything to traverse its way through to the other side. Hows that for a premise to a show? The story-lines are well thought out and the characters develop nicely. The show is very entertaining and has it's moments of greatness. Volume 1 contains seasons one and two. Both seasons together only make up 13 episodes. Now, BBC could have sold each season separately and charged a lot for each one, they did not. They combined the two seasons to give us a fair amount of episodes for our money. I applaud them for that. There are a total of 3 volumes that make up the whole series. My only complaint is that the 3rd volume does not contain the webisodes that are a prequel to the 4th season. But, they are easily found on youtube. The show does not hold with the traditional main characters must survive to the next episode. As you will see main characters die in this series or disappear. *****SPOILER ALERT**** The show starts out with the discovery of what they call anomalies (doorways into the past or future) and our first main character ends up creating a team to investigate these anomalies, with ulterior motives, he wants to find his missing wife. At some point he finds a camera with her picture in the past along with a campsite that has a dead body (not his wifes). In the next season we discover his missing wife is alive but with an ulterior motive of her own. As the series progresses we discover that she wants to destroy all of the human race to make way for a new dominant species to take over the planet as we have destroyed the planet in our future. She eventually kills her husband when he goes back into a burning building to save her, but that takes place in the third season. The new leader of the team ends up killing the wife at the end of that season, but ends up stuck in the past. By the 4th season most of the original casts sans 3 people have been replaced due to being killed off or lost. I am not certain why the writers did this but it lends a certain reality to the series. In that, anyone can be killed or lost. Two of the lost members do return and eventually regain their place on the team. By this time, the organization that tracks the anomalies is being co-run by a scientist played by Alexander Saddig (Dr. Bashir from Deep Space nine). Here he plays a very different character. ****Spoiler Alert Over****

It's a great show, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction, or anyone who is just interested in a look at what might happen if our past present and future merged through portals that show up randomly and in the strangest places.

A team of British scientists and Special Forces military types have been brought together by the UK's government to deal with this invasion of past and future monsters while struggling to cover the incursions up so it will not panic the people.

With raptors and tyrannosauruses running wild through the forests, buildings and streets eating people, it is a challenge to keep this a secret.

Rex is wonderful, and the whole cast does a bang-up job. Hannah Spearritt is a fine actress, better than most LAers, and  all the cast is excellent.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Vol-2-Series-3/dp/B002D1XKB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval, Vol. 2 (Series 3)</a>&nbsp;features great writing, like the ""haunted house"" episode, and the wonderful Tony Curran as a medieval knight fighting a dragon in modern-day London.

It was released Jan 10, 2012. ""Primeval: Volume Three"" actually is REGION 1, Season 4: Episodes 1-7, and Season 5: Episodes 1-6.

Now for the spoilers.
Spoilers, lots of spoilers.  First off, some of the original characters leave the show.  But unlike American TV shows where they disappear between seasons or shows, because they were killed or married or kidnapped by aliens,  Cutter and Jenny leave after a few episodes, as if giving us some more time with them before they go.  And, while I hated to see them leave, they leaving made sense to the plot and to the characters.  Which shows very strong, very focused writers.  They were given a proper send off.
I also liked Sarah Page as a new character and the idea that myths could be a source of new data.  The women in this show all seem to be damn smart, brave, and sexy to boot.
Now, not all the stories were as wonderful as I would have liked.  While we have some great, new, creatures showing up the ARC team never really seemed as interested in their origins as Cutter was and they never seemed to asks the questions needed to explore where or when the creatures were coming from.
Also, the future looked off.  Buildings were still around, looking like hundred year old ruins, in a landscape that looked like it had been changed over thousands of years.  What REALLY happened to the future?  What did mankind do to try to stop the predators?
True, there is another Season/Series out there, number 4, and maybe they wanted to answer those questions with new episodes but it still felt a tad weak.
But in the end the show is still going strong and the extras were ok.

3909713,4,B002D1XKB0,"The first two series for ""Primeval"" more than held it's own with other BBC shows such as ""Doctor Who"". Introducing a complex storyline involving anamolies that open a gateway to the past and future allowing creatures to escape into OUR time, Professor Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall) puts together a team of scientists to help determine what created the anamolies, how to prevent the creatures from causing havoc in our time and trying to figure out why Cutter's wife Helen (Juliet Aubrey)who has been missing for years, reappears and how she is involved with the anamolies.

SPOILERS:

Season three had major changes with the introduction of a new team leader Danny Quinn (Jason Flemying)when Cutter is murdered by his wife. While the series continued to introduce interesting stories during the third season much of the wind was taken out of its sails when actor Douglas Henshall left the show. Henshall it seems was distressed with the increasing tendancy to make the shows more about the creatures and less about the characters asking to be written out of the series.

It's a pity they didn't figure out some way to keep the character alive and also turn the series into a search for Cutter as his character was one of the most fascinating on the series. Henshall also was a dynamic and chariasmatic presence on the show and the series didn't quite recover after his character died. No other actor on the series has been able to fill the void left behind when Henshall left. The character of Cutter was very much the Doctor of the series. Flemying (the only actor with the chops to fill Henshall's shoes)came very close to void left when Henshall left but with his limited time on the series (he appears briefly during the fourth season to tie up the cliffhanger from the end of series three), the fourth series suffered from the same problem--the lack of a strong, compelling lead.

END OF SPOILERS:

The third season looks quite nice with a sharp looking transfer although occasionally the image quality does soften particularly during scenes involving extensive visual effects.

The third season had major changes with the introduction of a new main character and does a nice job of tying up the storyline involving Helen Cutter introduced during series one. Still, this is an entertaining series and the third season holds together nicely with some sharp performances and a truly stunning final episode.",1301184000,,2410,4.9236453201970445
3909714,5,B002D1XKB0,"I watched this show from series the first to the third(partly) on cable channel in Korea(South). The idea of Anomaly as rip of time and the image of dinosaurs are awesome and wonderful. It will be interesting if you compare this show with Fringe (telling about alternate universe and multidimension). In series 3, some features are changed from previous series. Previously they started the science logic, so the story was somewhat simple - dinosaurs appear, the team members struggle for their return, and anomaly close. But now it becomes more complex and larger - organizing of ARC, new members, new theory, conspiracies, new villain, ... so more adventures and actions. In series 3 DVD, there are total 10 episodes and four extra features(Douglas Henshall interview and two commentary eps. and character design contest winner), and all of them are interesting. Especially their joke, wit in conversations are very funny and cool. It seemed almost of the cast think about matching couple - Nick Cutter & Jenny Lewis, Connor & Abby, Danny & Sarah, ... maybe Captain Becker & someone new? :) Even though the case closing of Helen's crime, the ending scene is enough cliffhanging to hold my breath. This made me focusing and expecting the next series - 4 & 5. If they cannot be aired on Korean channel, I'm thinking about ordering the DVDs too!",1299283200,,1343,4.920704845814978
3909715,4,B002D1XKB0,"It's gratifying that, once in a while, the forces of good can triumph over evil, and by that I mean that PRIMEVAL gets a welcome reprieve from the axe. There is now projected to be a Series 4 and 5. Meanwhile, Season 3 churns out ten more fantastic episodes and continues to chronicle morose scientist Nick Cutter and his crew's explorations of the time rifts or ""anomalies"" that have been bedeviling modern-day England. More prehistoric creatures are featured, as well as more futuristic monsters. We learn the function of that mysterious artifact. And, oy, Connor gets to first base with Abby. Brilliant.

This series showcases a revolving door as new cast members arrive and old ones depart (some more permanently than others). But the quote from James Lester, snooty head administrator of ARC (the Anomaly Research Center), still applies: This crew is still very much ""a highly strung and temperamental team of rank amateurs who just happen to be brilliant at what they do."" New members include a dashing security officer, a feisty Egyptologist, and a resourceful maverick cop.

ARC is still doing its damndest to keep knowledge of the anomalies on the hush from the general public, but it's a herculean bear of a task as anomalies tend to sometimes pop up in the most inconvenient of places. Prehistoric creatures that menace the ARC crew number the crocodile-like Pristichampsus, a flock of carnivorous terror birds called the Titanis (they resemble evil giant ostriches), burrowing Diictodons which vie with Rex (Abby's pet Coelurosauravus) in cuteness, and the terrifying Giganotosaurus (which is larger than a T-Rex). Made up creatures include a fungi monster, a camouflage goblin, and a giant insect (as imagined by a contest winner). Meanwhile, the intelligent, exceedingly malevolent predators from the future are still ominously hanging about. As ever, the Framestore special effects team does marvelous work and renders these time-displaced beasties exquisitely in place.

This is still very much a fantastic show, never mind that it's ghastly how frequently the ARC facility is infiltrated and how incredibly naive it is that only security personnel go around armed while it's the more valuable (and weaponless) team members who most often get thrown in the thick of things. I was also hoping for more scenes of Connor and James Lester being uncomfortable flat mates. The cast is superb, but if I had to pick a standout, I'm looking at Ben Miller who plays Lester. Lester is a deliciously officious asshat, but damn if he doesn't become a more likable officious asshat in these episodes. Ben Miller also gets to deliver the show's snarkiest lines.

Old story threads are picked up. Jenny Lewis struggles with knowledge that she used to be another person in a past alternate time line. The show flirts some more with the Connor and Abby romance. And Helen Cutter, quite insane at this juncture, finalizes her plans to wipe out humanity. The ARC field team would have several occasions to travel to a post-apocalyptic future, the one Helen has been trying so hard to avert. Little by little, the crew makes certain technological advances in analyzing the time rifts, but ARC is still several crucial steps behind Helen, who manipulates our guys and makes it look easy. Her utter disdain for humanity makes her ever so dangerous.

One new story arc I didn't care for deals with Abby's punk of a kid brother moving in with Abby and you just know from jump that this kid was going to eff things up but big. Also, a journalist sticks his nose in, sensing a monumental scoop. Even more relevant to the overarching plot is the introduction of the ambitious Christine Johnson, a  military liaison officer from the Home Office (""Think velociraptor, only better dressed,"" grouses Lester). Christine Johnson - who is played by Ben Miller's real life wife, Belinda Stewart-Wilson - rivals Helen Cutter in sheer icy beyotchery, and I seriously didn't know whom I wanted to get her just desserts more.

I'm pretty sad that some of the core characters leave, but the new ones are growing on me. I'm very curious to see where the writers take this show for the next series as these episodes do close out the Helen Cutter arc. Andrew-Lee Potts, by the way, continues to be my favorite actor in this show. His nerd character, Connor Temple, is just endearing as heck.

PRIMEVAL Vol. 2 offers the ten episodes of Series 3 on three DVDs, and with the following bonus material: enjoyable audio commentaries on episodes #3 (with executive producer Tim Haines, series co-creator Adrian Hodges, and actor Andrew-Lee Potts), episode #5 (with producer Tim Bradley and actors Lucy Brown - who laughs a lot - and Ben Miller), and episode #10 (with producers Tim Bradley & Adrian Hodges and actor Jason Fleming); He's gone now from the show but ""Cutter's Odyssey"" features an interview with Douglas Henshall as he reminisces about his experiences during the show and about Nick Cutter's character arc (00:18:44 minutes long); and, finally, ""Genesis of a Creature"" is a segment about the 16-year-old winner of the PRIMEVAL 2008 Creature Design Competition as he visits the PRIMEVAL set and learns the different stages in which his creation is digitally developed and brought to life - his insect creature is featured in episode #8 (00:19:02).",1283558400,3,5326,4.989864864864865

3909718,4,B002D1XKB0,"There's good news and bad news for fans of the BBC Sci-fi show Primeval.  The bad news is that the show was canceled after the third season or third series as its known more commonly.  The good news is that in late September a deal was struck between the BBC and various producers to return the show to TV in 2011.  If you've never seen the show it's a quirky mix of The X-Files meets Jurassic Park, which is unfortunately an over simplification.

The plot concerns the ARC (Anomaly Research Centre), a group of scientists and adventurers who track down and investigate time anomalies which pop-up in seeming random fashion around the world.  These anomalies are essentially gateways to other time periods, typically prehistoric eras through which dinosaurs and more exotic, and even mythological creatures, enter our world.

As the third series opens, two new cast members join the team.  First there is Captain Becker Ben Mansfield), a Special Ops soldier assigned to protecting the team, essentially replacing Stephen Hart who died at the end of series two.  Sarah Page (Laila Rouass), an Egyptologist also joins the team when the museum she works in becomes the site of the latest anomaly.  Later in the season, former cop Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) joins the team after the death of one of the other main characters.

In all there are ten episodes in series three and there is a noticeable spike in the special effects and the scope of the episodes.  They are told on a much larger scale right from the beginning as a prehistoric crocodile comes through an Anomaly in the British Museum and quickly makes it way out into the streets of London .

Danny Quinn makes his first appearance in episode two in which the team is investigating a supposed haunted house where several teens disappeared years earlier.  Quinn is a cop whose younger brother was among those who vanished without a trace.

Episodes three and four are perfect examples of the show's larger scope.  In these two episodes we have Helen Cutter, the wife of team leader Nick Cutter, attack the arc with an army of clones leading to the near destruction of the facility and the death of a major character.  In episode four, an anomaly at an airport releases a Giganotosaurus that threatens to destroy jumbo jet unless stopped.  Quinn uses a helicopter to play chicken with the huge reptile.

The season ends with a chase across prehistoric time as the team tries to stop Helen from preventing human evolution and ends with a major cliffhanger.  Of course we'll now have to wait almost two years to find out what happens, but at least we will find out.

Primeval features truly outstanding special effects for a TV show.  The CGI simply is head and shoulders above anything you might see on the Sy-Fy channel for example.

We also learn more about the Anomolies and see possible future anomolies as well as the familiar past. There's also rival government agency interference to worry about too as if the anomolies and Helen weren't enough.

The only problem with this series is that they never made enough episodes. So that main characters aren't around long enough. They should go for 20 episodes a season like they do in the U.S.  I enjoyed this season for it's great stories but they removed the main villian and hero during it, which would take sixty episodes in a American Show.  Well at least this fun show will be coming back in two forms: A feature movie, (which may or not be the same actors) and at least two series of 13 episodes in 2011.  Not only has Primeval been revived from the grave, it will also get not one but two new series (series=seasons in the US) which will total 13 episodes.
here's the official story:

The fourth season will premiere on ITV early in 2011.  The fifth season will premiere on UKTV later in 2011.

Primeval fans will be ecstatic, because the new deal is on top of Warner Bros. continued production of a full scale Primeval feature film.

So we fans fo this great show will get to see more great primeval eps!
The best place to start is season 1 and 2 , which are on a single boxset and then grab this one.  THe show has incredible effects and engaging characters.  So get primevalized!

least the stories and plots are entertaining and (mostly) make sense. That in itself sets this show apart from most of the glop

3909740,5,B002D1XKB0,"The content of Volume 2 is the ten episode third series of Primeval.  Volume 1 combined the 13 episodes of series one and two.

My favourite bits were in episode three, where the humorous events at the beginning contrast deftly with its darker conclusion; episode four with the Giganotosaurus on a rampage; episode seven, with the cast in period clothing; and how later episodes depict a potential deadly future.

Primeval has never been a program that stood still.  Unlike many series where the cast is the same from year-to-year, this show has dropped old characters and added new ones each year.  In the first series, it was Captain Ryan and Claudia Brown.  The second series brought back the actress who played Claudia as a new character (to demonstrate the fragility of our timeline) along with two new characters who left with the end of that series.  Stephen Hart, who had been with the series since the beginning was also gone.  Then series three brings the most drastic cast changes of all.

I say this to make the point that the Primeval Volume 2 box set extras are mostly designed as a tribute to the third series cast changes.  One is a documentary, Cutter's Odyssey, devoted to Douglas (Professor Nick Cutter) Henshall's journey through Primeval.  Henshall's take on Nick's romantic history (""will they, won't they"") is something definitely worth viewing, especially for the way he ends his reverie!  The commentaries -- Episode 3 with Andrew-Lee Potts and others; Episode 5 with Lucy Brown and Ben Miller; and Episode 10 with Jason Flemyng and others -- have focused on those episodes where we say goodbye to some of our most beloved (and loathed) Primeval characters.

The series three episodes are a noticeable improvement over the second series, but my main reason for buying this box set was to appreciate and say farewell to some of the remarkable characters we've met over the past three years. Also, it's very good news that the series cancellation has been reversed and we will eventually see Connor and Abby get out of that tree!",1256342400,,2052,4.862068965517241

3909742,4,B002D1XKB0,"As of 1 October 2009, the latest report is that Primeval will return for a 4th season (series) on TV sometime in 2010. I sure hope so.

Even though Primeval has a lot of technical flaws, I still really like this series mostly because it has such an intriguing concept. Being able to travel both backward in time & into the future in this manner has unlimited potential - but only if the writers take the time to develop it.  Why not hire some professional science fiction writers as consultants? They would know how to do the job properly.

I also like the characters, & hope that the writers will bring back those they killed off by forcing reality changes (thanks Isaac Asimov).  However let us hope that the writers get over their (typically British) hate of firearms & allow the characters to carry some really potent ordnance with them when they go chasing dinosaurs. I would not care to go thru an anomoly without at least a fully armed SWAT team ready to cover me.  Actually a team of Green Berets or Special Forces would be even better.

I would also like to see an explanation as to why all these anomolies appear only on one tiny island, & not throughout the rest of the world.  In any event, here's hoping to see a new Season 4.",1255219200,2,1239,4.407894736842105

I did not mind paying for this fine show that mixes creatures and dinosaurs

Primeval season 3 started up not too bad, but after a couple of episodes they
became better and better.  Love the mushroom man....love what they did with
the dragon story....and the last episode points out to possible better stories
as what we see in the last episode is a writter's dream...so many stories could
be written...but as we are all used to now....when things are good..someone will
make a decicion to cancel it......and they did.

Today oct 1/ 2009 i have found the following information:
----------------------------------------------------------
After the finale had aired ITV announced that the series had been cancelled due the big budget it had and due to the fact that the network was struggling to find money for its programming. [2] This decision was over-turned on 29th Spetember when it was announced that Primeval had been recomissioned for a fourth and fifth series to air in 2011.

This is GREAT NEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1254355200,,1231,4.927536231884058
3909746,5,B002D1XKB0,"Following the shocking death of Stephen, who gave his life to save Nick, the team is down in spirits and numbers. Captain Becker joins the team as security when they investigate an anomaly sighting at a London museum. From that adventure, Egyptologist Sarah Page also joins the team. Throughout season the team goes through several major changes, including an administration shake-up and the addition of policeman Danny Quinn who worms his way onto the team as well.

This is packaged a bit strange, as ""Volume 2"" is actually the 3rd season of Primeval. The first seasons of Primeval were more episodic; whereas, the 3rd is more serial. It definitely helped to watch each episode in order. While the team still goes off to investigate anomalies in each chapter, the overall mission is to stop Helen from ending humanity. This season seemed to have much more suspense and danger than the last, as now it seems that no one is safe from death. Which means, this season was also a bit darker and ominous. Connor is just as quirky as ever, leading to some humorous moments along the way. And Connor and Abby's relationship finally heats up.

This season brought back Douglas Henshall as Nick Carter for a few episodes. But he was replaced by Jason Flemyng's Danny Quinn as leader of the team eventually. Andrew-Lee Potts returned as Connor, the goofy but brilliant paleontologist. And Hannah Spearritt's Abby was back as the spunky zoologist with a big heart for all creatures that come through the anomalies. Egyptologist Sarah Page is played by Laila Rouass, who's role is never well-defined. Ben Mansfield as Captain Becker was quiet, but always ready to step up and protect the team from danger. And Juliet Aubrey made several appearances as the villainous Helen again.

Unfortunately, this was the final season, as it was cancelled soon after the cliffhanger ending where Helen tries to end the evolution of man. But it was a wonderfully, exciting season that I loved even more than the previous.

I first picked up Vol 1 here in the states and the wife and I were totally enchanted by the theme and the actors. It was a fun show with some great thrills and action. Of course we were sad that Nick Cutters character was killed off by his witch of wife, but we still loved the remaining characters especially the special forces fellow and the new guy former policeman Danny. We sat waiting to see Helen Cutter get her comeuppance, but what a pyrrhic victory that was when a couple months later we learned the show had been given the axe.

I also think that the studio has a lot of nerve charging the price they are on Amazon, for only 1 season, plus the knowledge that their will likely be no resolution to the whole Anomaly story and mans future and maybe even the possible return of Helen Cutter just like we saw other character Dopplegangers from other timelines return.
