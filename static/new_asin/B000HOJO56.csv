8140583,5,B000HOJO56,"This was the last volume I was needing to complete all 3 volume of the all female metal video compilation from Nuclear Blast. All three volumes are great as I love female metal. And of course all three volumes comes with a companion CD. I'm not sure if anyone else have mentioned it in here, but all three volumes of this DVD series is in PAL format so a multi-region player is needed.
