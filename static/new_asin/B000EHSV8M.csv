2520470,5,B000EHSV8M,"Billy and Ruth Graham are portrayed through news media clips as well as personal family photos in many geographical settings that show Billy as a world's statesman.  The film is gripping and moving through the decades from Truman to current President, Bush, giving clear understanding of the true humility and concern for individuals throughout the Earth regardless of their political or personal views.  The film uses news media objectivity that lends to credibility of this documentary.  Its appeal will cross all religious and non religious persuasions.",1154995200,18,556,5.441860465116279
2520471,5,B000EHSV8M,"I disagree with the previous reviewer, and find that Billy Graham was greatly used by God because of his love for ALL people, including the Jewish race...after all Jesus was Jewish!  Billy Graham shared the love and grace (the Gospel or ""Good News"") of Jesus Christ with a dying world.  It was this love for people and God that made him great! It was the simplicity of the Gospel that drew thousands to a personal relationship with Christ.",1151884800,24,439,4.615384615384615
2520491,4,B000EHSV8M,"I enjoyed this dvd and play it often. It is a good overview of Billy's life and career. I also remember many of the events featured in the dvd, so it is also a trip down memory lane. I listened to the radiio shows as a child on Sunday afternoons.",1459296000,2,246,3.94

IT will bring you such joy.",1459123200,2,352,4.348484848484849
2520493,5,B000EHSV8M,"An accurate, well-done story of the life and ministry of Billy Graham. Not over dramatized displaying a glamorous life; but realistic and truthful. How it caused me agony to view U.S.A.'s once devoted reference to the things of God, and now the disheartening departure from the Bible, prayer and devotion to God. That many would view this and be on the alert for what we should be before our Holy God.",1453161600,,401,4.661971830985915

2520495,5,B000EHSV8M,"This is not only an excellent look at the life and ministry of BIlly Graham, but it is a tremendous look at the times in which he was on the world's stage.  This man was used in a most unique way to reach millions around this world with the gospel of Jesus Christ.  His contribution to our culture has been invaluable.",1441065600,2,318,4.19672131147541

2520498,5,B000EHSV8M,"While already knowing a fair amount and having great respect for Billy Graham, watching this documentary almost brought tears to my eyes.  Many people are aware that his crusades have helped lead millions of people to Christ in America, but this video really shows his involvement with United States Presidents and also leaders all over the world. World leaders everywhere would meet with Dr. Graham and many sought his advice. Dr. Grahams relationships with other countries no doubt had a significant positive impact on Americas relationship with those countries.

Graham has seen our culture and world go through a lot of challenges in his 60+ year ministry and he has always been there proclaiming the only real answer for all mankinds problems. From segregation, Vietnam War, the cold war, 911 and the rest, Billy Graham has faithfully served as an Ambassador for God.

It is profoundly moving to see a normal man from North Carolina answer the call of God on his life even with the personal sacrifices and trials it meant for him.  Christian or not, watching this video causes  powerful conviction seeing this humble man of integrity reaching the world with his selfless love for humanity rooted in Gods love. This video inspires us to live our life according to Gods purpose rather than running the endless circle of selfish worldly pursuits. Billy Graham is a testament that God has a plan for all of us if we will commit our lives to Him and receive Jesus as our personal Lord and Savior.

It is impossible by human means to measure the impact this messenger of God has had on the world. Only God knows.

I don't think there will ever be another single person like Billy Graham before Christ returns.  It is up to all of us together to take his place according to the gifts God has given each of us for His purpose. Will you answer your calling as young Billy Graham did and find the fulfillment God intends for you? Thank you, Billy Graham.",1425772800,9,1949,4.711764705882353

2520502,5,B000EHSV8M,"Tells the life story of Billy Graham and what an amazing life it has been.  He has always been faithful to God's calling and did what was necessary to avoid scandal in his ministry. Was very impressed how he gave his heart, soul and life to further the Kingdom of the Father.  This was an outstanding movie that you will want to watch many times.",1405209600,2,346,4.3076923076923075
2520503,4,B000EHSV8M,What a true man of God and to be able to see how God worked through this man. Only to be like him would be life changing and scary.,1405209600,,131,3.5517241379310347
2520504,5,B000EHSV8M,This film is outstanding. It captures his life in great detail. The film shows his humanity and his amazing life as God's chosen servant. This is a must see film.,1399593600,,162,4.433333333333334

2520506,5,B000EHSV8M,"No matter what your take on Christianity, there can be no denying that Billy Graham made the great commission of Jesus- to bring the Gospel message of hope, love and salvation to the ends of the earth- his life's work.  One simple message of truth and the spirit of God transformed the son of a humble dairy farmer in Charlotte, North Carolina into one of the most pivotal and influential men in history.  Hosted by Sir David Frost, authorized by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, loaded with extras, this DVD tells the incredible story of an incredible man who has led an incredible life.  Though Billy Graham would sincerely give all glory to God, the average person will be utterly dumbstruck by his seemingly tireless work in winning souls to Jesus.  A must see for anyone even casually interested in the story of this man's ministry.",1394668800,3,847,4.780821917808219

2520509,5,B000EHSV8M,I believe it is the most comprehensive video presentation of the life of Billy Graham and his extraordinary ministry. I would recommend it to anyone who would like a good understanding of this outstanding person. I was surprised at the influence he had not only in the United States but also around the world. I liked it!,1374105600,,321,4.649122807017544
2520510,5,B000EHSV8M,"This is NOT a. Graham PR pic, but a rather factual presentation of the life of Dr. Graham. David Frost as narrator gives it an ""investigative journalist"" tone. It deals with controversy in Graham's career. Overall it is positive because so little  negative stuff has clung to him, one of America's most admired men. This would appeal both to Graham fans and those seeking to evaluate this man at the end of his career.",1371772800,4,418,4.648648648648648
2520531,5,B000EHSV8M,I admire Billy Graham very much. THis is a fairly definitive view of his life and ministry yet is also a very enjoyable presentation. I've watched it twice and plan to share it with friends.,1371686400,,190,4.457142857142857

2520534,5,B000EHSV8M,I appreciated seeing this story of Billy Graham. I learned more about the man and more about the work he carried out. He was welcomed in a lot more places than I was aware of. I enjoyed it very much.,1349913600,,199,4.0
2520535,5,B000EHSV8M,"In this excellent biography we see how one man changed the course of history by preaching the truth in love. Before watching this DVD I had no idea of the commanding presence of Billy Graham and how powerful a simple message of hope could be. What is really amazing is how many countries he traveled to and how God opened doors for him to preach all over the world. The world would truly be a very different place without Billy Graham. I was humbled and blessed after watching this film about his life. You will be amazed at how many famous people's lives were changed because they spoke to Billy Graham. What an amazing life! My father was also an evangelist and traveled to many of the same countries to preach in the open air. While my father didn't talk about Billy Graham I have a feeling that he was deeply influenced by his life.

2520537,5,B000EHSV8M,"I bought this video because Billy Graham messages always touch my heart and them I decided to buy and watch carefully his history in this video and I am so glad that I did it. Today, knowing more about his life and ministry it is amazing to learn how GOD used this man to bring so many people to know HIM.
I shared this video with my two kids and they also got amazed with Billy Graham's simplicity when preaching and how easy is to understand GOD's word throw his message.
Billy Graham just turned 93 and still the most respected evangelist that spoke for the largest number of people in this world.
God really blessed me and my family throw this video.",1320883200,,654,4.32520325203252
2520538,4,B000EHSV8M,"Whether or not you believe in God, this DVD provides a very thought provoking view of one of America's most famous preachers and a master of the spoken word. Although it has a bias towards the man, you can see why as Billy Graham has been the confidante of every single US president since Truman and has had a profound and enduring impact on American, if not World affairs.

The DVD starts off with the usual selection of 'best of' moments. Although David Frost* makes the point that no other man could pack as many stadiums as Billy Graham, one does get the impression that he is just another Southern preacher who talks the talk but probably doesn't walk the walk.

As the DVD begins going through his life it starts to turn interesting. His rise, for its time, was meteoric with him starting off as a lowly farm boy and quickly rising (once in the church) to State-wide, region-wide and nationwide preacher. On the way he seems to be in the forefront of inventions that later evangelists adopted, such as radio evangelism, 'crusades' in major cities as well as the much imitated set of rules he created, setting him apart from previous corrupt preachers.

After showing some of Billy Graham's crusades in America, he then proceeds to travel abroad to places such the UK, and eventually the Soviet Union. Although his job seems easy in retrospect, it is amazing to see him let into so many anti-Christian and even Atheistic states (like North Korea and China) and see that it is not just places like America that attract mass crowds to Christian gatherings, but also places like Britain and the Eastern Bloc.

The documentary ends with current events, his family and more words of praise from various acquaintances of the man. In the extras there is an interview with David Frost, and there are snippets of crusades and interviews with the director etc.

To conclude, I would say the documentary was a bit too long and was formulaic in its structure by showing too many sycophants and not enough criticism. However, if you research on the internet, you will find that people are either in Zombie like esteem or irrationally hateful of him, and this DVD seems to strike the right balance. This doesn't mean it is a good documentary as a result (hence not 5*), but its content and delivery do make it worthwhile watching.",1286323200,,2321,4.6928746928746925
2520539,5,B000EHSV8M,This is one of the best overall reviews on Billy Graham and his historical background of preaching God's word I have ever experienced.  I was enlightened about his trials and tribulations along the way of getting to his widespread acceptance.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to know more about this messenger of God.,1285200000,,330,4.875
2520540,5,B000EHSV8M,"Billy Graham is the evengelist that God used to awaken America after WW2. His ministry was faithful, clear, consistant and with no scandals with women or money. He set a high standard for his ministry and has been faithful. He is a humble man. Because of his closeness to the presidents, a generation rejected him with Nixon and Johnson during the civil unrest and anti war protests of the 60's and 70's. They rejected Billy Graham and Christianity and we are seeing the results of their rebellion. Throwing out Jesus and the 10 commandments and our Christian heritege has brought in other false gods and the breakdown of families and our nation. Those who remember Billy Graham remember his message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. This is his story.",1285113600,16,762,4.824427480916031

2520565,5,B000EHSV8M,Excellent video footage of Billy Graham and family and ministry. I first heard him preach in Louisville KY when he was close to losing his sight.

2520569,5,B000EHSV8M,"I watched several times this DVD. The best thing about Billy Graham is, he sticked to his calling, even though he had known many Presidents and there might have been chances of entering into politics but He remained true to the call of GOD.  His preaching has inspired me a lot and even my son and daughter who are 6 & 8 years old like the way Billy Graham preaches.  In the 11th Chapter, his preaching clippings are very effective and the introduction by Sir David Frost is excellent and the way the clippigs of Billy Graham is fantastic.",1168128000,13,539,4.434343434343434
