5459391,3,B00ANGIBCU,"Quite dissapointed in this movie. I really like Luke Goss, and he does alright here. However, he is not the tough guy you expect or want him to be. Which is quite a let down. This movie could have been so much better and alot more action driven if Goss had been allowed to kick ass and do his thing. So you wait, and wait for something dynamic to happen, and it never does. Goss is a high spender who is down on his luck and can't pay his bills or expensive rent. He makes a bad decission that costs him what little money he has left. He tries to get the money back but is out gunned, out tough guyed, and gets hosed. This movie had great potential but somebody dropped the ball, a shame. It is quite watchable and well made, and if you do not know who Luke Goss is, you will probably enjoy it.",1371513600,2,794,4.031645569620253
5459392,4,B00ANGIBCU,I liked this movie. Good acting and believable storyline. This movie will keep you watching. It's a sleeper and under-rated.,1367366400,3,124,5.25
5459393,2,B00ANGIBCU,The acting was less than stellar to say the least.  Very stiff all the way around. The plot was average.  I wouldn't waste your money on this one.,1365897600,,146,4.178571428571429

5459395,4,B00ANGIBCU,"""I've got three months before this whole thing blows up in my face."" Brian (Goss) is having a bad day. First he gets laid off, then gets in a fight with his wife, then finds out the savings he thought he had isn't as much as he was expecting. He stops at a bar to think and finds an old friend who says he can help. Risking everything Brian gives him all he has. When two young kids interfere with the plans everyone's life is affected. Going in to this I had no idea what to expect. I was very surprised with what I got and really really enjoyed this. The movie is tense and you aren't really sure what character to root for and it stays that way for just about the entire movie. Equal parts drama and action, this a the most realistic movie of this type I have seen. You will see what I mean when you watch this. I just put it in as background while I was doing something else but found myself 100% involved about 20 minutes in. I really enjoyed this. Overall, gritty, real and de-pressing...see what I did there. I give it an B+.",1362009600,8,1032,4.1138613861386135

5459408,4,B00ANGIBCU,"A lot of times Amazon's Prime movies leave a huge gap in believability other times they are just really lousy movies. This independent film does NOT suffer from either.

Brian (Luke Goss) gets pink slipped from his job. Drowning his sorrows at a local barra de tata, Brian runs into its owner, an old classmate, Jimmy (Michael Eklund). Jimmy tells Brian that if he (Brian) tossed in some money the two could get involved in some ""import/export"" [drugs]. Jimmy makes the call telling his contact the money's in his car.

Meanwhile, kids Jesse and Sam steal the car and after having a flat find the briefcase with $100,000. Brian confronts Jesse who is packed to leave believing his life in imminent danger.

The story is great. The acting is above par for these type movies. The camera work, however suffers from too much jiggling as if a couple teenagers were given a Super 8 and told, ""Go at it.""",1469404800,,897,4.628930817610063

5459435,5,B00ANGIBCU,"Very good movie on how over-paid executives who live on credit way beyond their means behave when faced with financial ruin.  This film shows a family man who lost his high-paying job realizes he is going to lose everything and resorts to the hope of quick money he thinks he can make by dealing with a local bar owner who claims he can triple $100,000 with a dubious investment.  Now, this business man who is supposed to be so smart cashes in all his investments on this long shot and blindly hands over $100,000 to this bar owner who is going to a drug deal.  The bar owner throws the brief case full of money in the back of his car, which is stolen by two teenagers who find the money and in their little brains, they are rich and spend half of it on junk and a new car.  They left their cell phone behind, which identifies them and the business man, who in the meantime has accidentally killed the bar owner, finds these kids and demands the $100,000 back.  In the meantime, the mob feels they have been scammed and want the money and the drugs.  This goes from bad to worse.  The business man has a wife and son who have enjoyed the good life on credit are totally oblivious to their financial situation.  Without spoiling the end, you will need to watch this one until the end.",1457136000,,1284,4.2987551867219915

5459442,4,B00ANGIBCU,"Very suspensful with little fluff and some reality filming that hits deep into the economic crises for many!  Losing a hight paying job is more than most people are prepared to deal with in the moment!

5459455,1,B00ANGIBCU,Some movie makers don't respect the time I spend in watching a movie so i developed the habit of skipping to the middle and end to see if I am still interested.

5459456,3,B00ANGIBCU,"This was a tough call. The beginning was pretty dull, Luke Goss is not a real actor in any sense of the word. The things that occurred in this movie go under the heading of ""are you really that stupid?"" and that applies to every character. if you can get past the lack of brains among any of the characters, it is a decent movie and the twist ending...a long way to go but the end was good. Luke gets fired, he doesn't tell his wife, instead he invests in a drug deal, 2 teenage boys steal the car that had the money for the drugs, they spend the money and well the dealer wants it back so the guy (luke) and the 2 boys are in it up to there! Again you will constantly roll your eyes and just shout...Really! But give it a shot and don't expect much...but the ending.....did love it, that is what put it up to 3 stars. The performances (except Luke Goss who is a wooden as a forest) everyone else was okay.",1441929600,,906,4.067039106145251

You'll neither love nor hate our 'hero' and therefore don't really care if he succeeds. You don't care if he gets his money to fulfill his $25k charity donation for which his wife is nagging him. You don't care if he loses his job... you're just rooting for a terrible car accident that will let him pull on the mask and become Frankenstein, prison driving champ.
