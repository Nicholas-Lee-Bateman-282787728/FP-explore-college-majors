6445924,5,B00KTEBFGK,"Gravity Falls is a gem. It continues to deliver hilarious, weird, and awesome stories. It's always crazy but never incomprehensible. The animation and soundtrack are beautiful.  Here's some other reasons I love Gravity Falls:

* It's positive and heartwarming, but never in a saccharine or forced manner. The main characters are good people who are nice to each other without being some sort of mindless drones created for the purpose of teaching love and sharing.

* The two siblings get equal plot time and are not shallow gender stereotypes.",1411257600,8,544,5.089887640449438
6445925,1,B00KTEBFGK,"This is an example of Disney not caring. Not only is the dvd give a bad quality you are missing the final 2 episodes  So you have two episodes missing to complete the season. One of the ads for the movie are for Frozen while it was in theaters. They didn't even bother to change the ads for it. If you love the show do not buy this. It contains a lower quality then what aired on tv. Wait until they do a full season in one deal, don't even bother purchasing. Disney did not care about making a good product, you should not care to buy.

Its sad since this is a great show worth watching multiple times. To bad Disney doesn't want you to.",1409097600,5,638,4.055555555555555

6445929,5,B00KTEBFGK,"So Excited! It says it is going to be 176 minutes long which means 8 episodes! And since I'm not a snob about video quality, I don't mind that this is going to be just on DVD. I just hope the episodes are in order, but if they aren't it's no big deal. I just want to have one of my favourite shows on DVD to watch.",1404345600,12,314,3.701492537313433
6445930,1,B00KTEBFGK,"Gravity Falls is without a doubt the greatest Western-made cartoon this decade.  I am a huge fan of this show, and as such have spent $100+ on making a Blu-Ray set for myself and friends (Consisting of a blu-ray burner, disc printer, inkjet writable blu rays, and official vortex blu ray cases - not to mention all the episodes we bought on Itunes to support the show).  I am hugely critical about episode quality, to the point where even some HD encodes don't suffice.  This show looks absolutely amazing in true 1080p.  I have yet to see a movie or even Anime that looks as good in 1080p as Gravity Falls does, with razor sharp lines and crisp colors.  Alex Hirsch and his team have done an incredible job on this show, and huge kudos to them.  Writers such as Michael Rianda, Aury Wallington, and especially Zach Paez have also done an exceptional job on writing hilarious and engrossing plots that can be watched over and over again.

However, Disney doesn't think so.  They think MPEG-2 encoded 480i encodes of this show will suffice.  This is unacceptable.  Now I hear all you fanboys out there ""if u want to watch it in hd, then watch the digital downloads"".  Okay, then why should I own an inferior copy in the first place?  Add to the fact that digital downloads are DRM-ridden and extremely compressed.  This show can benefit from a blu-ray bitrate with the amount of detail on the screen at once.  I have an old 1440x900 resolution monitor and can clearly see some artifacting in current encodes of the show.  I understand the fact that buying this release will ""Convince Disney to release more down the line"".  However, all they plan to release are more of these crappy SD releases which may make a good last minute birthday present for little timmy.

Alex Hirsch:
""The DVD thing is pretty frustrating. I sent like an 8 page letter to the folks in charge of merchandise basically BEGGING them to do a full season blu-ray with commentary and the works. (Because that's what I would want if I was a customer)
Their response was: Too pricey. A 20 episode set with features is at least 5 times more expensive to produce than a 6 episode set, therefore it needs to sell 5 times as many units or they'll never make a profit. With the DVD market in a lag its hard for them to convince Mickey to shell out the dough for this experiment.""

I know from Disney Channel's past that there is no way that a Blu Ray set will ever be released.  Phineas and Ferb, a show massively more popular than Gravity Falls, doesn't.  Disney's methods are very different than those of Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon.  So overall, if you don't give a crap about detail, then this release should suffice.",1403740800,36,2687,4.544698544698544

The earlier episodes with a * are included in the ""Gravity Falls: Six Strange Tales"" DVD.  Why on earth they don't release a complete season is beyond me.  As of November 2015, nothing else from Season 1 is released except the 12 episodes below, and nothing from Season 2 is released.  Come on Disney, wake up!

*1. Tourist Trapped: The twins come face to face with the town's strange secrets.
*2. The Legend of the Gobblewonker: Dipper and Mabel go boating to find a sea monster.
*3. Headhunters: Mabel sculpts a life-size wax statue.

(I WOULD have liked it if there had been more episodes [that I like] on it!) I like this DVD because it has several of my favorite episodes, and you can't get them on disc anywhere else, as far as I know. Yes, this would have been far better if it had been Blu-Ray and all that jazz, but if something like this is my only option for getting stuff like Gravity Falls in disc form, I'll definitely take it.  To me, the quality of this DVD, and most others I've seen, is at least watchable, if not great --- or even REALLY ""good."" But for me, that'll do, at least until this show (maybe) finally comes out on Blu-Ray. Sometimes you just have to go with what is there because it's better than nothing at all --- as is the case here, in my opinion. Anyway, I like this DVD and am glad it was put out, otherwise I wouldn't have any of these episodes!",1423785600,12,991,4.161458333333333

6445991,5,B00KTEBFGK,"Ah, Gravity Falls -- a quaint, quirky little town that is sort of like Twin Peaks as imagined by a six-year-old on a sugar high. The kind of place where the impossible happens frequently, usually with wacky results.

And ""Gravity Falls: Even Stranger"" brings us another round of adventures for the Pine kids, ranging from a bottomless hole to a roaming time traveler who ends up in a lot of trouble. Creator/voice actor Alex Hirsch is still churning out stories of sublimely high quality, with gloriously weird problems, great dialogue (""You're so organized. Show me that checklist again!"") and jokes that may be even funnier to adults than children.

Dipper's ongoing efforts to woo Wendy keep going awry. First, he tries to photocopy himself and ends up with an army of angry Dipper clones during a wild party. Then a day at the fair goes awry when he and Mabel encounter a time-traveler, whose magical tape-measure he hopes to use to win a toy for Wendy... except they end up timeskipping to all the wrong ""whens,"" and Mabel may lose her amazing new pet. And of course, he summons a ""Mortal Kombat""-style video-game character to beat up Robbie... but learns that he might have opened a Pandora's box.

Other fun adventures in Gravity Falls:
*Pioneer's Day takes an unexpected turn when the twins discover that the town's founder is a lie, based in a very old conspiracy locked in a prison of peanut brittle!
*Dipper worries about Mabel's growth spurt, and comes up with a bizarre way to equal her height: crystals that make you change size! Too bad Li'l Gideon is back.
*Soos, Stan and the kids fall into a bottomless pit. While they're falling, they exchange bizarre stories (which aren't quite long enough to be episodes proper) to pass the time.
*Mabel gets to be boss of the Mystery Shack to prove that being nice and lenient works better than crabbiness, and discovers that it's not as easy as it looks.
*Summerween (like Halloween, but with watermelons instead of pumpkins) comes to Gravity Falls, but Dipper hopes to be seen as more adult by not trick-or-treating. Instead he offends the Summerween Trickster, and must provide a certain number of candies or be eaten.

One of the best aspects of ""Gravity Falls"" is how it's clearly a kids' show, but cleverly written enough that adults can enjoy it as more than a kid's cartoon show that doesn't make you want to stab yourself in the face with a fork. Some of the jokes are actually funnier to adults than they are to kids (""In Gravity Falls it used to be legal to marry woodpeckers."" ""Oh, it's still legal. VERY legal"").

And while it has some lessons like ""accept your silliness,"" there's also some sly subversion of the usual ones (""Man, revenge is underrated. That felt awesome!""). No, the real focus here is on Dipper and Mabel having wacky adventures, defending each other from cruel blondes, government conspiracies, Li'l Gideon, and the ongoing woes of the journal's secrets. It's the kind of show that you can imagine a kid dreaming up, where you could get zapped into a pinball machine and have to ride a mine cart to thwart its evil master.

The one irritating aspect of the story is Dipper's ongoing obsession with Wendy -- while it's natural for pre-teen boys to start developing crushes, it kind of takes over some of the stories. Things are more entertaining when it focuses on prissy, organized Dipper and the gloriously wacky, nacho-earringed Mabel, human hamster Soos and the goblin-like senior Grunkle Stan. And we have some fun supporting characters like Mabel's friends Candy and Grenda, the snooty Pacifica, Old Man McGucket, and of course Gideon (who is like an evil little steamed dumpling with lots of hair product).

""Gravity Falls: Even Stranger"" is another delectable little round of wacky, well-written tales of magic, mayhem, and pigs won at a carnival. How about a full season set?",1422403200,7,3872,4.813533834586466

So the big three problems are thus:1. standard def, 2. only half the season, 3. no bonus features.

8661329,4,B00KTEBFGK,"From one of the writers behind Spongebob comes this charming series about 2 kids going off on supernatural adventures with their uncle and new found friends in the town of Gravity Falls. This is definetely one of the best shows out there, and this DVD comes with the next 8 episodes where 6 Strange Tales left off in the series. While it doesn't really have any bonus features and the selection screens are a bit lacking, the episodes themselves range from good to great. Whether this is a gift for someone or just for yourself I recommend getting this if you like the series or shows like Ducktales (Classic and Reboot), Adventure Time, Ed Edd n Eddy and/or We Bare Bears.",1510012800,,673,4.570247933884297
