But when I watched some trailers on youtube,I realised, that the reality is quite different and that there are places in Mexico, that are worth to see. The document is made as a celebration of 200 years from  foundation of the country. Anyway, it not only shows beautifull places from te whole country, but represents the local areas along with the animals living there, furthermore, if you are not interested in animals, you can always watch lovely fairies walking on the cliff or jumping in to the river or lakes.

I was really impressed with the document timeline and i really liked the idea of making slow movements of the ladies walking across the beach and so on. The only thing that should be better is the quality of the video. In my opinion, you can find better quality on youtube. The Menu is also quite ineffective ... there is one main video file with a length of 30 minutes, which is simply an integration of the single video clips, that are located under ,,Estrellas"" where you can choose from the simple video clips divided into smaller pieces,so i can recommend watchong always only the first one.

Thats all,so in general : great scenery and work,but the navigation should be better :)
Sorry for my english - I am from CZ. And this reminds me, that you will need to set your region to ,,4"" in order to watch it :)",1329523200,2,1453,4.559386973180077
4641321,4,B005AOA79K,"Everything is amazinly captured.  This is the real Mexico.  Most people ignore how beautiful its people is and all the amazing places Mexico has.  Excellent filmography, great detail, super sharp (and I ordered the regular DVD version).  Great composition too, and the use of wild animals-exceptional-love the jaguar.  The sound mix is great too, two sound choices.  My only complain is that they sell this as a 103-minutes-long disc, and it is only 30 minutes long.  Even if you count separately the times for each identical version on the same disc (as one comes with the captions of the locations filmed and one without) that would barely make it a 60 minutes disc, but NO it's only about 30 and is not even a documentary, it's purely visual.  No other extras, no special hidden menus, or anything like that.  Pretty straight forward, push play and 30 minutes later is over.  IT'S TOO SHORT.  Perhaps advertising on the package that it is 103-minutes was a good strategy to sell more?",1321401600,3,987,4.781065088757397

4641325,5,B005AOA79K,"It's an artistically well developed film from the various regions of Mexico. It pays homage not only to nature, but also to the great civilizations of its territories.
  Each region is represented by its alluring nature, native people and the exotic animals that reside in that specific region of the country. The songs of the various video clips are exquisite, sang not in Spanish but rather by the languages use by the Mayans, Olmecs and Aztecs.
  The film will enchant you into exploring its majestic nature.",1301184000,6,511,4.906976744186046
