7963904,5,B0000687DX,"This is a fine documentary about Dame Kiri Te Kanawa with plenty of vocal excerpts that will convince you, if you are not already convinced, that she truly had one of the finest operatic voices of the 20th century. There is a little bit about her adoptive parents and a very tiny bit about her husband and children, but overall I felt the movie could have given more insights into who she was as a person. There were few interviews of people who knew her. I suppose it was a bit tricky to interview people about someone who was still at the time the reigning soprano in the world. The most I learned was that when she left New Zealand for the UK she was already very famous (in New Zealand) and her first year at Covent Garden some people didn't believe she'd make it because she didn't seem focused enough. There is a small passage about a difficult time in her career. She also speaks eloquently about discipline and about the way the voice of aging singers changes. The movie was made in 1991 so you get a peak into the hairstyles and clothing styles of the day too... Dame Kiri predicted she only had 6 or 7 years left as an opera singer at the time of filming and she wasn't off by much since she retired in 1999. The musical excerpts were truly stunning. The documentary runs for about 1 hour and 45 minutes.",1470441600,,1314,4.323886639676114

Of course, I've watched this outstanding presentation several times already, and will be watching it many times more! That should say it all for the quality of this product!",1280361600,3,284,4.816326530612245
7963906,5,B0000687DX,"I have just received the dvd of the life of Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and to the truth that I continue convincing my self that she is the  better lyric soprano that has existed. Kiri is one of those few singers that can sing everything well, everything sings beautifully. She is the best Manon, the best Desdemona, the best Capricio, the best Arabella. For something they say that who can sing  Mozart successfully can sing any thing and she is the best Mozarian Soprano ever. That can also manages to give passion and feeling to the Verdi's best roles (Traviata) and to the heroines of Puccini. I recommend  this video to everyone who wants to learn what is to sing with the best of the technicks(skills). She is more than a beautiful sound. She is a totally lady in the all sence...",1031529600,21,778,4.464788732394366
7963907,5,B0000687DX,"Several years ago, in a Kansas City motel room killing time, I watched a TV special on the life of Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, and it blew me away. I didn't have a VCR handy, and have been searching ever since, hoping someone had put the program I saw out on VHS or DVD.  Through my recent computer purchase and AMAZON.COM, I finally acquired both the VHS tape and DVD.  Truly a remarkable story of a magnificent human being, entertainer, and opera singer.  I have sung professionally but claim no operatic knowledge or expertise.  However, it certainly seems that Dame Kiri Te Kanawa has the richest and most precise voice I have heard; I think she is the female equivalent of Pavarotti--a voice that is so captivating you don't have to be an opera lover to appreciate.  It is so much better being able to watch and hear her sing, and learn of her remarkable life as an adopted orphan and her rise to the top.  It is an inspiring, warmly human story and the best musical experience as well.  Buy it.",1029888000,25,993,4.423076923076923
