8047940,3,B0007KVMHI,"This is an old (1974) Italian film with nonprofessional actors therefore both the acting and video quality are below par, however it is still watchable.

The main story line follows the unusual tale of Aziz and Aziza, lovers who have a somewhat strange master slave relationship. However there are other stories within the story, and still more stories within these stories and all the stories are interwoven into one another. The film sometimes seems disjointed but eventually comes back to the original plot. I can see how some people get lost in the confusion, and in fact some of the stories seem to be missing some background information which would be helpful in understanding them sooner.

The dominant themes of the stories are love, lust and sex (mostly heterosexual, but some homosexual) and yes there is a lot of nudity here both of males and females, including some close-ups of male genitals. The sexual encounters in the film are uninhibited, but at the same time neither graphic or explicit. Jealousy, pain, loyalty, betrayal, etc. are also covered in the plot. These sub stories also include intervention by the gods, a demon, and other mysticism.

I almost quit watching about the middle of the movie but am glad I continued on to the end, the movie turned out better than I expected it would when I had only seen the first half.",1435708800,,1346,4.818181818181818
8047941,5,B0007KVMHI,Great imagery for most of the film. Loved being brought into the mythical near east by the director. The casting was effective. They worked the story and let you see an other side of the world.,1357344000,,193,4.388888888888889
8047942,3,B0007KVMHI,"This film is necessary only for the Verhoeven completist. There is no trace of the films to come (Spetters, Fourth Man, Robocop) and video and audio are no more than acceptable.",1345334400,,177,4.741935483870968
8047943,2,B0007KVMHI,"Can't sleep at night?  Just put on this movie and will help you fall asleep in a nano second.....Slow melodramatic movies are not my cup of tea.  I am sure though, that other people might enjoy it.  I guess,  I failed to see the Poetry in it.",1328918400,,242,4.085106382978723
8047944,4,B0007KVMHI,"Also a ""Thousand and One Night Stories"" (""Arabian Nights"") was fairytales somehow remembered from an early kidulthood, watching this sexy staff is a real fun after reading newspapers of islamist advances worldwide nowadays.

It is hard to believe that ancestors so addicted to sex left behind just blood thirst well-based on a complete ignorance to the neighbour.
Not so bad movie also characters are played by actors with quite average appearances on any level while DVD extras are really poor contextually.",1324339200,,508,5.271604938271605
