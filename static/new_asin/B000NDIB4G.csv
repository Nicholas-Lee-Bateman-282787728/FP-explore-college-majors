8177159,5,B000NDIB4G,"These three short films, inspired by the magic realism style of Garca Mrquez are sweet, short and perfect for class.  They are under 30 minutes, with subtitles, but even without the Spanish is quite easy to understand.  I recommend them highly!",1396483200,2,244,4.926829268292683
8177160,5,B000NDIB4G,"Love is something you can't fool around with. These three short stories were very inspirational, specially ""The Two Way Mirror."" However, if you understand Spanish, I suggest you watch it in Spanish. ""Ya nadien muere por amor,"" Nobody dies for love anymore; its one of my favorite quotes form that short story. If your a hopeless romantic like myself, you will love this video.",1210204800,,377,4.90625
