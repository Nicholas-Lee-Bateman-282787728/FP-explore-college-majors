8308466,3,B001HBE2D2,"This movie, which I saw on cable Video-on-Demand, was much better than what I expected it to be=- although I'm not sure what it was about.

 It appears, on the surface, to be about a lady who was in an accident, has amnesia and can't remember any of the accident details-- nor anything else in her life-- and now is being held captive sort of (she doesn't try to escape and really has no reason to) in a psychiatric hospital. No one is mistreating her, but there seems to be some sort of foul-play going on behind the scenes. But what? As the story unfolds, it appears that something else altogether  is going on. And what it might be is hard to say. Whatever it's about it's fun to look at.

The movie's sinister air of ambiguity is reminiscent of David Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" (a movie that I would never have understood had I not read through all the Amazon reviews of the movie until I found an interpretation that explains the storyline). For fans of Spanish cinema, there are plot echoes of ""La Ardilla Roja,"" in unadorned garishness.",1290729600,,1041,4.492063492063492
