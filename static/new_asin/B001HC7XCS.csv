3628970,5,B001HC7XCS,"I admit it, I'm just a big kid. I love movies like this, and when it comes to the old Disney Magic, you can't do better than ""Lady and the Tramp."" The animals, the songs, every part of this movie is absolutely enchanting, and guaranteed to make you forget your troubles for a while. My favorite song is ""Home Sweet Home,"" belted out with mournful gusto by some hilariously dramatic pooches in the dog pound. The Humane Society never had better marketing. The only song that isn't up to snuff is ""What is a Baby,"" which falls kind of flat.

The blu-ray transfer is impeccable, with vivid colors and an audio track that is very crisp and clean, considering the movie's age. One thing Disney never cuts corners on is the quality of its film transfers. If you love the old style Disney animation, this is a must-have for your collection.",1521936000,,833,4.516556291390729
3628971,2,B001HC7XCS,"The picture & sound quality are excellent EXCEPT for the fact that it has captions that I cannot get rid of.

3628976,5,B001HC7XCS,"I was surprised by the six-plus hour runtime.  However, you're getting three versions of the movie itself, including one that's a kareoke-ish version for singalongs,  and several very old/dated ""extra"" cartoons.

Five stars for the charm of the original story.",1520726400,,260,5.45
3628977,5,B001HC7XCS,"Love this movie!  So glad its available as a digital copy.

3628982,5,B001HC7XCS,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my Great Niece.  She just LOVES Lady and the Tramp.  She received a stuffed Lady Dog for Christmas last year and this year got a stuffed Tramp and the DVD.  Happiest girl in the world.  I ordered it late and it arrived super fast.,1519862400,,266,4.1568627450980395
3628983,5,B001HC7XCS,"Lady and the Tramp was the first animated film from the Disney Studio based on an original story rather than an established classic. It was also the studios first Cinemascope animated feature. Lady is a pampered female dog belonging to Jim Dear and Darling. When her human masters bring a baby into the house, Lady feels shes being eased out, and when Darlings Aunt Sarah introduces her nasty twin Siamese cats into the household, Lady is sure that shes no longer welcome. The cats cause all kinds of havoc and destruction and Lady is blamed and muzzled. She escapes and runs across the path of Tramp, a male dog from the wrong side of town.

Lady and the Tramp (1955) was Disneys 15th animated feature and started life as a group of sketches dating back to the late 1930s. The original songs were written by Peggy Lee and Sonny Burke, with Lee singing La La Lu, The Siamese Cat Song, and Hes a Tramp on the soundtrack. The film is lush and evocative of an idealized world with its cozy home, dog-loving humans, and dogs with personality. The artists keep the views at dog level, so we just see the feet and legs and arms and hands of the human characters.

Stand-out canine characters apart from the title duo are Trusty, a bloodhound who smashes his nose to the ground when following a scent, Jock, a Scottish terrier who bounces up and down when agitated, and Peg, a sultry Pekingese who channels Mae West singing a torch song about Tramp. One of the films most memorable moments, which has been spoofed many times since, is a scene in which Tramp treats Lady to a spaghetti dinner outside an Italian restaurant as they are serenaded with the song Bella Note.

The Blu-ray/DVD Signature Collection Edition contains the original Cinemascope theatrical version and a sing-along version with lyrics appearing under the image whenever a song begins to play. Theres also an Inside Walts Story Meetings version featuring audio commentary. Other bonus content includes the featurettes Walt and His Dogs and Stories From Walts Office; How to Make a Meatball and Other Fun Facts About Lady and the Tramp;"" and trailers. A digital copy is enclosed.",1519776000,,2141,4.734584450402145

3629057,1,B001HC7XCS,"This was given to my daughter as a gift and it completely fried one of our HDMI ports in our tv. As soon as we put the disc into the player you could hear electric crackling and popping. It made it to the language selection screen, and after selecting the language, the system crackled and popped (No, I'm not advertising Rice Crispies), following which the screen went all staticky and then black, leaving us with the message on the screen saying ""No input""... we tried restarting the player, unplugging it from the tv and the wall, but each time the system would commence crackling and then go black saying ""no input"". We tried a couple different blu rays and we got the same thing each time. So we switched to a different HDMI port and it worked just fine with the other movies, but I'm not going use this Lady and the Tramp blu ray again and risk blowing out another port in our tv. I have a very disappointed kid, and a less than impressed parent with the quality of this movie. So I would say purchase at your own risk.",1501977600,,1025,4.34375

I ordered the $11.99 DVD (as opposed to the higher priced blue-ray or two disc options) to show to a classroom of kids in an after school program before Valentines Day.  I unwrapped the new DVD, put it in the player, and got a message: CANNOT PLAY THIS DVD / THIS FORMAT WILL NOT WORK / ETC.  UGH!!!!

 I remembered another message I got when I ordered the DVD just a few days before - something along the lines of ""We will make the DVD once you place your order.""  huh????????  Apparently whomever ""made"" this DVD forgot to hit a switch on his DVD maker - or it was made for some other player.

If you want this added to your ""Disney Movies Anywhere"" (which links to Vudu as of March 2015) just enter the ""Disney Movie Rewards"" (DMR) code from THIS EDITION and you will have this in Disney Movies Anywhere (and Vudu if linked properly) even though this movie has been in the DISNEY VAULT since April 30, 2013.  This is the oldest non-3D DISNEY VAULT movie that had a Digital Copy available after DMR was also available.

I hadn't seen this movie in at least 10 years, so I was very excited to find it, especially since it was one of my favorites growing up!

I was nervous because I saw many reviews where the buyer received the UK version, or a version where the code had already been used. However, I was very pleased that I received a brand new copy of the US version. The code work just as I had hoped.

If you want the authentic US version, don't cheap out. The page leads you to believe that you are getting a US Diamond edition at a low price. This is not the case. Also, read the seller's description to make sure you are getting the right one.",1424044800,,779,4.084967320261438

3629464,4,B001HC7XCS,"Hmmmmm.  Jim Dear gives Darling a puppy in a hatbox with no holes in it.  He's lucky it wasn't dead and she thought it was a stole.  Good grief, what were these people thinking!  (The incident was based on Disney giving his wife a Chow puppy in a hatbox.)  Does PETA know about this?!  For all we know that box could have been hermetically sealed!  Just saying..........

Anyway, this is a Christmas movie of sorts, pinned between two different Christmases, featuring the lovely song Peace of Earth (sung by Donald Novis).  After that, it turns into an action packed thriller and a romantic comedy.  Not bad for a couple of dogs, a dimwitted beaver, and two truly sinister felines.  There's also a grotesquely cruel Aunt no one should leave in charge of a baby.

This old classic holds up pretty well for a box office success that critics panned at the time of its release in 1955.
My only complaint is about poor Nutsy heading for the one way door.  He's only seen as a shadow on a wall then he's gone for good.  Talk about a bit part.",1416873600,,1036,4.412698412698413

Walt actually had the studio make 2 films since there were so many more theaters that didn't have widescreens.  It would have been nice to have the other version to compare to which they actually released on Laserdisc in the 90's.,1395446400,,382,4.602941176470588

From the beginning of the cartoon however , suspicion is brought to this dog without manner who comes from nobody knows where.

After all what does it cost? and then with all the loot it could bring in!

A film not recommended to children in part because of the music scene at the midst where a prostitute sings the merit of our tramp in bed. She's accompanied by a chorus of dogs without pedigree and sentenced to death on top of that!

The motive? reproduction, assimilation of wealth, control of territory. The bastard will accommodate very easily to its role of impostor.",1386460800,,881,4.5

3629699,1,B001HC7XCS,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is a classic. I only gave this one star due to it's inclusion of HDCP DRM and the amount of largely unskippable commercials and other garbage that play automatically when inserting the DVD or Blu-ray disc.  Seriously, at least 6-7 minutes of crap before you can even get to the main menu. There is a ""fast-play"" option that cuts it down to like 2 minutes, but if you happen to miss it, then you're stuck having to watch everything. Ridiculous.

The HDCP DRM is a bigger problem, though. I have a dvd player connected via an HDMI-DVI cable to an old (non-widescreen) LCD monitor in my son's room, and it refuses to play since the monitor is ""non HDCP compliant"".

3629708,5,B001HC7XCS,"Disney Studios 15th full length animated feature film may seem like a step back on the surface, but Lady and the Tramp is another quality Disney film and the first to be produced in CinemaScope. Considering this was released at the height of the studios resurgence, it does seem a little ordinary when compared with the animated full length feature films that came before it.

The film looks amazing on Blu Ray and the colors pop even more on this sparkling Blu Ray treatment than ever before. The extras carried over are very good, but the new features are nothing all that impressive, probably lack of material is likely the culprit. A terrible practice by Disney is to drop art galleries from the previous releases and there is no reason to lose any bonus features in the place of others here. Not carrying over the old games etc. is understandable, but the art galleries are interesting and take up very little space. The film is presented in its original theatrical format CinemaScope.

Still the film has never looked or sounded better and there are some quality bonus features on this set. Overall this is a very satisfying release. The story is simple and the animation is classic Disney.

If you don't own any edition, then the Blu Ray is by far the best choice.",1377734400,,1271,4.665178571428571

3629731,5,B001HC7XCS,"This 1955 movie stands up to the test of time and is a lot of fun to watch.  The story of Lady and the Tramp is touching, raucous, exciting and energizing.  The characters are enjoyable and well developed, and you find yourself rooting for them as they make their way through the story.  It's a Disney flick, and everything turns out all right, but there are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep it exciting, and you can't be sure of the ending until you get there.  The evil Siamese cats are a hoot, and Lady's dog friends are loyal and stick with her to the end.  This movie depicts a world where motor cars are something new, around the turn of the 20th century, and yet it is as clear and comprehensible as a story set in the present day.  I haven't seen Lady and the Tramp 2, but it's on my list, and I'm hoping the Disney crew got it right.  The songs in this movie are entertaining and topical, and the sound quality is first rate.  The video quality is also very high; I was worried that it would be showing its age, but it doesn't.  This movie could have been made last year.  I think this flick is a winner for young children and is a good time for adults as well.  I bought this movie as a present for my goddaughter and will be giving it to her in a few months as a gift of classical animation to complement all her Studio Ghibli movies.

3629736,1,B001HC7XCS,"There's no doubt that this is a very good movie for the entire family.

If so, why would Disney prevent you from watching your digital movie on more than one monitor simultaneously?

I have a dual monitor graphics card; at first I couldn't figure out why the Disney movies wouldn't play on any of my two monitors. Then one day, one of my monitors was not connected and I decided to watch a Disney Digital film and it played. Presto, I realized later on that when I have both monitors connected to my graphics card Disney has fixed so that you and I cannot watch the digital movie, we paid big bucks for, on two monitors at the same time via your computer. I have many other digital movies from Universal, Warner etc. and they all play whether or not I have one or two monitors plugged into my graphics card.

So beware. If you have Disney digital movies on your computer and you have a dual-monitor graphics card and say one day you and your family decide to watch Snow White but you and your wife want to watch it in the bedroom and the kids in their room--forget it--it's not going to happen. Why did Disney do this? Control? They don't believe you own it?

Whatever the reason, it's not good for business.",1370822400,,1208,4.355555555555555

It might be a decade or two before you get another chance.  Yes it's a marketing ploy, but it works.  That's why Disney continues to do it.

As for this movie our oldest can't get enough of it.  If there's one movie that he'll watch over and over it's this one.  He's 5 now.

Periodically even before Walt Disney died, the company would put some of their movies in a ""vault"" and keep them there for years to supposedly make them more sought after when they became available again.  Before VCRs, DVD players, Digital copies, and super Internet companies like Amazon, that might have made sense.  Now it doesn't.  Someone at Disney is still trying very old methods to inspire people to rush out and buy a copy.  Personally I think they're idiots.  I was planning to buy the Blu-ray anyway and then they can jam it away as long as they like.  Should some children or elderly people not see it again because of their idiotic vault nonsense, it will only hurt the fans that have always held Walt and the Disney company in high esteem, and they will only make us think less of those in charge at Disney.

P.S. Should I come back and haunt them when I'm gone? Walt may already be spinning in his grave.

That said, wow, the quality of the picture on the blu-ray disc is amazing. I love that Disney has gone through and done a really thorough job of remastering these older classics, rescanning the original film and cleaning up the picture. I'm really glad that I decided to get the Blu-ray/dvd combo instead of just the dvd set.",1363564800,,526,4.479166666666667

3629802,5,B001HC7XCS,"I loved this movie as a kid, but wasn't sure how interested my little ones would be in it.  But I decided to get it after my sister talked about how much her kids love it! And I am so glad I did, my kids love it too.  I remember as a kid this movie being sort of ""grey,"" but the restoration is beautiful and it is definitely full of color now, and the backgrounds and colors are beautiful.  As a kid, I loved this movie because I have always loved dogs.  Now, as an adult, I enjoy this movie because:
-the beginning is so adorable, when Lady is a puppy and gets lonely and climbs the stairs.  And the owners are funny ""if we are going to show her who's master we must start from the very beginning.""
-the love story is cute, and the spaghetti scene so iconic (and my picky eaters will all eat spaghetti now)
-anyone who has a dog, and then had a baby will find it interesting to see the goings-on from Lady's perspective.  The scene when Darling says ""No, Lady, no walk today"" is too familiar!
-the movie takes place in an interesting time period, early 1900's, with some cars, some horse and buggies, the end of the Victorian era? kind of neat.
-this movie definitely shows the difference between dog people -""Lady's trying to tell us something!"" and non-dog people (or cat people) -""That animal's loose!""  And let's face it, I could totally see a restaurant owner giving two dogs a spaghetti dinner.  people even give their dogs weddings nowadays.
-growing up we had a dog with a sweet personality like Lady, but now we have a little terrier, much like the Tramp!  And I can tell you if our dog wanted to run away i don't know how anyone would be able to catch her.  And chasing chickens...a terrier wouldn't be able to resist it! it's all about the chase.  fun to watch.
-and if your kids are going to watch tv, it is better for the younger ones to watch things that have a slower pace, like Thomas the Train, or older movies like this, without so much craziness and over-stimulation.

I still love this movie, maybe even more than I did as a kid.  And my little ones love it too!",1362700800,,2083,4.283163265306122

3629902,4,B001HC7XCS,"This is the best movie about dogs I could ever ask for. The music if good, the fact that it's a simple film about dogs, and the events of the film. I've watched the 1998 Masterpiece tape a lot when I was a kid, and now I find myself watching this DVD a lot, too. Just like ""The Lion King"" Diamond Edition DVD, there's a a few minimal bonus features that match my expectations. Tramp is an enjoyable dog character, carefree, but fun and heroic. My 3 favorite parts in this movie are when Tramp fights the alley dogs that chase Lady when muzzled, when Tramp attacks the rat, and when Jock and Trusty (though mostly Trusty) saves Tramp from the Dogcatcher's wagon. Though I really wish people would stop acting like Trusty could have died from the crash; after all, the wheel only crashed on Trusty's leg, not his whole body! Oh well, it's a minor thought. Overall, if you love dogs, a simpler romance, then I recommend this movie to anyone.",1351296000,,938,4.427745664739884

3629925,5,B001HC7XCS,"Lady and the Tramp is not full of magic, fairies, princesses or other elements that are usual in
Disney films. It's a simple love story and one of Disney's most down-to-earth films. The story is
not complex but it has a lot going for it: Two sympathetic leads, a wonderful interaction between
them, beautiful scenes (bella notte sequence, anyone?) and great supporting characters. Who
would have thought that a love story between two dogs could've been so appealling, romantic and
fun? Walt Disney did a pretty good job with this one and had stood the test of time very nicely.

Lady and the Tramp has always been well regarded by the Disney Company and earlier this year, it
became the fifth title to be given the lavish ""Diamond Treatment"" and the results are spectacular.

Video & Audio
Disney has a high reputation when releasing its classic films on BD and Lady is not exception. The
lavish restoration that Disney has given to this film is simply breathtaking. Colors are rich and pop
out of the screen. Detail is perfect and contrast is strong. Also there is not any anomaly like
artifacts, banding or others. Is a completely perfect transfer through and through.

In the audio department things are pretty good too. You have two options: a newly produced 7.1
DTS-HD MA and a newly restored version of the original mono audio presented in 3.0 DTS-HD MA.
Both tracks are outstanding and everyone should be happy with the results. No hiss, no
background noise, everything is crystal clear and has good directionality. A superb audio
presentation.

Bonus Material
Lady and the Tramp comes with a nice assortment of bonus features both new and old.
Unfortunately is not as comprehensive as previous Diamond titles such as Beauty and the Beast or
Snow White but everything here is nice and informative.

-Disc introduction by Diane Disney Miller is exactly that as Walt eldest daughter talks about the
movie, her father and their connection.
-Audio commentary: Inside Walt's story meetings is the best new feature of this set. Similar to
Bambi's story meetings, here you can listen a group of actors reenact all the meetings that Walt
and his team had for the creation of this film. You can't miss this one.
-Disney Second Screen is a way to enhance the viewing of Walt's story meetings with additional
storyboards, artwork and more.
-Diane Disney Miller: Remembering Dad is a touching tribute from Walt's daughter where she talks
about the time where Lady was been created alongside Disneyland. Another must see feature.
-Three new deleted scenes.
-A newly found unused song
-Classic DVD bonus features carries over most of the material from the Platinum DVD.

A DVD copy of the film is also included.

Closing Thoughts
Lady and the Tramp is one of Disney's most enduring classics. With great characters, a wonderful
romantic story and beautiful animation, this film has stood the test of time and has become one of
the most celebrated animated films of all time. This new Diamond Edition presents the film in a
spectacular way with fantastic picture and audio and a nice assortment of bonus material. This set
comes highly recommended!!",1337644800,,3140,4.902071563088512
3629926,5,B001HC7XCS,"Of all the Disney full-length cartoon stories, this is my favorite. I love Fantasia even more, but that's not really a story. This is the one that will always tug at my heart. I saw it when it was new and I was pretty new myself: eight years old.

Jim Darling gives his wife a cocker spaniel puppy for Christmas. ""What a perfect little lady,"" she says, and the puppy has a name. And of course, she is completely charming. So when she just can't handle sleeping in the dog bed in the kitchen, the Darlings let her sleep on their bed ""just this once.""

Dissolve to a nearly grown Lady sleeping on their bed. She's six months old and time to get a license and a collar. Her friends Jock (a Scotty) and Trusty (a bloodhound) are impressed. To them, it is a symbol of respectability. ""Everybody knows,"" Trusty says, ""that a dog's best friend is his human.""

But soon, Lady is feeling neglected because Jim and Dearest are acting so strange. She describes the situation to Jock and Trusty, who explain that they're going to have a baby. ""What's a baby,"" says Lady, in one of my favorite lines. Tramp, walking by, tells her they are nothing but trouble.

And so it turns out, although Lady likes the little critter once she is introduced. But then Jim and Dearest go off for a vacation and leave the baby (and Lady) with their crabby old aunt. And her two Siamese cats. Their song, ""We are Siamese if you please. We are Siamese if you don't please,"" is such fun, as they sing while demolishing the house. When Auntie is finally alerted to the mess, the cats pretend they are injured and that it was all Lady's fault.

So Auntie buys Lady a muzzle, but Lady escapes the pet shop and runs away, until cornered by some brutish junkyard dogs. However, Tramp intervenes and saves the day. When he sees she has a muzzle, he takes her to the zoo and cons the beaver into chomping it off, claiming it's a log puller. And in fact, the beaver finds it very useful.

So Tramp gives Lady a tour of the town, and then ends up at Tony's Italian restaurant for dinner, where Tony and his assistant serenade them with the beautiful song ""Bella Notte"" while they eat a plate of spaghetti ""heavy on the meatballs."" Then a chorus with very lovely voices sing it again while Tramp takes Lady on a nighttime stroll through the park.

The next morning, they go chasing chickens at Tramp's suggestion, and Lady ends up in the pound. There's Peg's immortal song, ""He's a Tramp,"" with her multi-ethnic chorus, and then Lady is bailed out. But she's put on a chain attached to a dog house in the back yard. When Tramp comes to visit, she snubs him because of what Peg said about all the girlfriends he has had. He slinks off.

Just as it starts to rain, a rat creeps unto the roof and into the baby's room window. Lady barks and barks, but Auntie just hollers at her and doesn't understand. Tramp hears the barking and comes to the rescue. He kills the rat, but creates some chaos in the process, including knocking over the baby's cradle. Auntie is just calling the pound to have him taken away, with Lady locked in the cellar, when the Darlings come home. Trusty and Jock track down the dog catcher's van and Jim Darling and Lady follow in the car once they see the dead rat and figure out what happened.

In the end, we're back at Christmas (presumably two years from the opening scene), and Tramp is a part of the family, wearing a collar. There are three adorable girl puppies who look just like Lady, and one boy who looks just like Tramp. (Who cares if genetics doesn't really work that way; this is Disney.)

There is a slight difference in the details of the background, but not enough to justify upgrading from DVD to Blu-Ray.

And I have found this to be the case of all hand-drawn animated movies. Of course, Pixar's computer-animated movies are a different story.

However, if you do not as yet have the DVD, this Blu-Ray set is worth purchasing (but not at typically-high Disney prices). Lady and the Tramp certainly has one of best musical scores of all time.",1335398400,,646,4.6

The sound and picture quality is amazing. What surprised me though is the fact that instead of using the 2006 CGI castle Walt Disney Pictures logo at the beginning, they leave the 1990 logo like on the Platinum Edition DVD. But that's just a minor complaint, nothing huge. The bonus features are great, however, they lack on the DVD. I truly enjoyed the introduction at the beginning by Dianne Disney Miller (Walt's daughter). I also liked the clips from the Disneyland TV show that were included on the Blu-Ray. This was also great for me because I missed out on getting the Platinum Edition DVD back in 2006, so now I get to enjoy this.

3629944,3,B001HC7XCS,"I love this movie! I remember watching this movie since I was a kid. You might ask me why I gave this only three stars? It's because when it finaly arrived at my house, I got a cheep version of this dvd. I was disappointed when Disney Studios took the Platinum Edition dvd of Lady and the Tramp out of print and in to the vault. But I found out that the dvd was being sold here on Amazon, and I was thrilled when I bought it. I waited two weeks for the dvd to come until it finally came. I was happy it came, but when I opened the box, I found out that it was obviously a fake! I looked at the comparisons between the dvd covers, and the colors didn't match at all. Also, the words on the back of it looked all messed up and weird. Even the two dvds inside didn't look right; the colors on the top of the first disk were all funky to. I got even more pissed off when I watch the movie itself, and the movie looked like as if I was watching the movie on a VHS tape. The only good thing about the dvd was the bonus disc, which did have the bonus features, and they had good picture quality as well.

It's not the dvds fault, but it is Amazon's and the seller's fault. The seller must have been (and I'm not trying to be racist, but if I am, I am deeply sorry) someone from the middle east. The dvd looked like as if the dvd cover, companion booklet, and the disks were poorly printed out by the seller. Excuse me for my language, but I think it's BULL! Thankfully, I bough the new dvd version of Lady and the Tramp On March 23. I would have got the Blu-ray version, but I don't have that much money to afford a Blu-ray player and Blu-ray dvds. I gonna try and contact the seller and try and get a refund, or at least a replacement to get the real dvd set. Hopfully it will happen and I might get the real dvd set.

The bonus feature is also pretty interesting for what its worth. I recomeend this movie if you love and disney animated movie where it was mostly about animals besides humans. However, I've read reviews of parents going crazy over the tiniest things so keep in mind, this movie might not be perfect for your kids if your over-protective.
Unlike most disney movies, no one really dies except an evil rat and possibly a dog but you can always bs your kids and say the dog was adopted or something like that. The moral of the movie is very good and encourages everyone to watch this movie.
My final word of advice, if you like this movie and know what has happened recently to disney movies that are hits and get sequals, the sequals normally suck. Lady and the Tramp II is an extremely har movie to love so don't buy that movie if you haven't seen if before. The moral is part Lady and the Tramp, animations makes you cry with like the difference between the fox and the hound movies, dioluge of like the fox and the hound 2, and some touchy feeling like Bambi II...

The bright colors and great original English soundtrack makes this film a great classic. However, the Spanish dubbing is a little bit disapointing; the main reason is because the grace is missing and the voices do not match correctly. It is hard and complicated to compare the original Spanish dubbing with the 1997 dubbing. Once again, the cats are not singing with feeling and the little chihuahua doesn't talk with a funy voice like used to have it. I understand that Disney has to work with a re-make voice becase of the legal problems. But, just imagine, how magnificent could be if we have these films (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and Lady and the tramp) with theirs original Spanish dubbing and perhaps those who have legal concerns with the companay fix their differences and make a good deal in order to allow us to hear the wonderful voices that they placed on those films. I have not problems to listen the film in English or Spanish, but I expect a high quality product.

3629966,5,B001HC7XCS,"Lady and the Tramp is one hour and fifteen minutes and was released in theaters on June 22nd, 1955 and was the 15th animated feature film from Walt Disney Studios. The movie tells the story of two dogs from very different up bringing. Lady is a female Cocker Spaniel that is own by Jim Dear and Darling and lives in a middle to upper class suburbs. Tramp is a strayed mutt that lives life day by day and has no permanent home. The two meet up when Tramp is in her next of the woods and Lady is upset because Jim Dear and Darling have been treating her coldly. Jock and Trusty try to calm Lady by telling her that Darling is having a baby and explaining what a baby is. Tramp tells his version in somewhat of a negative way. Soon after the baby is born, Jim Dear and Darling go on a little trip and Aunt Sarah comes with her two Siamese cats (named Si and Am). Aunt Sarah dislikes dogs and when she finds the room a mess and her pet cats faking injuries she blames Lady and set out to get a muzzle for her. Lady does not like the muzzle and escapes with it on. She is trapped by some tough street dogs, but Tramp comes to the rescue and saves her. Tramp shows Lady what life is like without the collar and eventually winds up at Tonys' Restaurant. The next day Lady finally arrives home after being caught and sent to the dog pound. While chained to a dog house she spots a rat and tries to scare it away, but is unable to; Tramp shows up and Lady tells him that there is a rat in the baby's room. Tramp is able to kill the rat, but Aunt Sarah seeing the crib knocked over believes Lady and the Tramp are responsible and locks Tramp in a closet and puts lady in the basement. Aunt Sarah calls up the local dog pound and they take Tramp to the dog pound. Jim Dear and Darling come home and lady shows them what really happened showing them the dead rat. Jock and Trusty feeling bad that they misjudged Tramp, go after them. The two catch up to the horses and buggy and are able to stop them, but Trusty is severely hurt. In the next scene it is Christmas, Lady and the Tramp are ""married"" and have puppies of their own and Trusty is has a cast on his right front paw.

Lady and the Tramp was the first animated movie filmed in Cinemascope and since not all movies carried Cinemascope it was also made in the standard Academy ratio. In the scene where Trusty was hurt badly the script was to have him die, but Walt Disney fearing negative reaction that he got from Bambi scrapped the idea and in the next scene Trusty is shown recovering from the accident. This was Disney's most expensive film at that time beating out Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Lady and the Tramp gets an AAAAA+++++.

Classic Disney cartoon love story of two dogs from different sides of the tracks
Causes me to refer to our fluffy beast as ""That dog!""
Great songs
Scene of Lady & Tramp sharing spaghetti is one of the most memorable animated scenes of all time

3629970,3,B001HC7XCS,"I won't say anything about the film itself. It's a Disney classic, you will either love it or not. I have some issues with the film in terms of pace and storyline, but as a film I would give it perhaps the same score. I simply thought it was OK. Besides this, the Blu-ray transfer has proven to be a bit controversial. Is the Tramp some various shades of brown throughout the film? Yes. Is there an issue with the sound quality? Yes. This being the biggest deterrant. What I mean is that throughout the film you may notice a hissing sound in the background as background music or dialogue is going on, almost sounding like your speakers are simply too loud and slightly rattling. I initially thought the problem was my television, as I own a thin flat-panel, but even with the volume lowered, the hiss was still apparaent. This I attribute to the age of the film print the production team must have been working with. This being such an old film, perhaps contains these hissing sounds and could not have been reworked out of the film, hence during music and dialogue (or when there's a high enough sound coming from the movie), this hiss will continue. I suggest you just try and ignore it. Now the movie is presented in widescreen format. A couple of reviewers are complaining that this is not the original Cinemscope widescreen format as seen in movie theaters way back when. Perhaps not, but what this movie is NOT is a standard ""set-for-tv-movie"" box aspect ratio. Any casual viewer will not notice anything but the great digital transfer put onto Blu-ray; lines are sharp and colors are as vibrant as they can be. As an animated feature of this many years old, this movie is a joy to look at. As for all the naysayers, don't hold your breath for Disney to rework the film AGAIN in order to preserve every single exact color and whatever original aspect ratio of yesteryear, it's not going to happen. So just be happy with the transfer the way it is now, because along with the great picture, handful of special features, and usual pristine Disney presentation and packaging, this movie is a must-have for any Disney fan. I just really wish they could have done something about that sound problem.",1330300800,,2201,4.588832487309645
3629971,5,B001HC7XCS,"If it weren't an animated feature, and was a contemporary live action romantic comedy/drama, Lady and the Tramp could very well star, for instance, Jake Gyllenhaal or Ryan Reynolds with Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Aniston.

""She's a well-bred, meticulous looker but a little naive and a bit of a control freak! He's a sloppy, jaunty hunk who lives on a lots of friends' couches and has trouble committing to one person! Over the course of the movie, she learns to lighten up and he learns the value of a responsible relationship! A popular song plays as they head back to the city from Central Park or hop on the cable car with the Golden Gate bridge in the distance! Or any number of variations on the same story!""

Even though it was released over 50 years ago and occasionally betrays its era (the baby bottles in the window, stereotyped incidental characters that were ""safer"" in their day than now), Lady and the Tramp is, in many ways, more sophisticated, witty and -- dare I say -- sexier than some of today's wafer-thin incarnations.

Come on, that spaghetti scene. It predates the eating scene in Tom Jones by several years. Lady and Tramp awake in the morning after a night out, followed by a scene in which her neighbor dogs Jock and Trusty propose marriage to her. Sure, it's so she has a roof over her head (the annoying Aunt Sarah has put her outside) but it suggests they're trying to make her an honest woman.

I thought I was really stretching things by suggesting that last assumption, so you can imagine my surprise when several Disney artists and historians say just about the same thing on one of the bonus features! Movies were changing in 1955, and Walt might not have made Lady and the Tramp in quite the same way had the war not prevented it from going into production a decade or so sooner.

All underlying meanings aside, Lady and the Tramp is one of Disney's biggest consistent crowd pleasers, as is evidenced by the fact that this supposedly ""old"" movie is neck in neck with the latest Twilight movie for the number one sales spot (as if this writing the Blu-ray has edged out its rival). The story is brisk, relatable (the idea of being ""replaced"" in someone's heart worked so well for Toy Story, too) and it is visually stunning. Everything has a handsome sheen on it, capturing a Main Street, U.S.A. idyll that Walt was simultaneously creating for his Disneyland Park.

On the new diamond edition Blu-ray, this detail and color are nothing short of breathtaking -- even in seemingly simple scenes like one in which Lady walks upstairs and various carpet and wallpaper patterns go off in maddening directions, yet perfectly in perspective. It's the Alice in Wonderland look, but sane.

Perhaps no other Disney animated film features a larger cast of iconic voice talents who had shone in radio and were moving into television, including Grammy winning comedy giant Stan Freberg as the Beaver (Freberg shows us how he does the whistle voice in a bonus feature).

Alan Reed, soon to become immortalized as the original Fred Flintstone, is Boris the Russian wolfhound. Verna Felton, who would grace many a Disney feature, moving effortlessly from villainy to benevolence, would soon be Fred's mother-in-law. Dal McKennon (Gumby, The Archie Show, Epcot's American Adventure) plays several roles, one that sounds much like his Mr. Weatherbee at Riverdale High.

And doing the most voices of all, almost heard in every scene, is the underrated Bill Thompson, whose most famous voice embodied the White Rabbit and Jock for Disney, as well as Droopy for MGM and Touch Turtle for Hanna-Barbera.

This is also the first Disney animated feature with a starring lead. Before Billy Joel, Elton John or Phil Collins became part of Disney projects, pop goddess Peggy Lee was brought aboard to add a creative imprint unlike anything Walt had ever so graciously welcomed.

Even though Lady and the Tramp isn't a musical in the traditional sense, Lee's presence is felt throughout, either through songs she wrote with Sonny Burke or any of her four voices (the breakout being the torchy Peg, who's a cross between Mae West and Jimmy Cagney.

As per the usual custom, most of the classic DVD features from the 2006 Platinum Edition DVD have been moved to the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray now has an Audio Commentary (thank you!) and the nifty ""second screen"" feature that allows you to gather further behind the scenes treasures from your laptop while the disc plays on your player. There's also a deleted song that Tramp was going to sing called ""Free as the Breeze.""

They then came out with the DVD, which was far better. The colors were definitely brighter.

Now with Blu-ray, on the other hand, not only are the colors bright but the details are so crisp and clear! I notice textures I could not originally see on the older versions of this film. It is absolutely amazing! The second I hit ""play"" on the menu and the opening credits began to roll I literally said ""wow"" because the textures that I never noticed before were suddenly noticed by me for the first time.

I love it. The blu-ray is definitely worth getting!",1329091200,,787,4.1644736842105265
3629977,5,B001HC7XCS,"Over the years, Disney has gone from giving us quality to giving us garbage such as the stuff found on the Disney Channel (Shake It Up, Jessie, ANT Farm). This proves that Disney has not been as good as they used to be. Thankfully, however, some of the workers at Disney work their hardest to satisfy the fans of the older days such as myself, by re-releasing their animated movies for new generations, among other things. With the Diamond Edition of Lady and the Tramp, they are not only doing the fans of the classic Disney films justice once again, they are also doing ME some justice, as I am a huge fan of Lady and the Tramp. In fact, I was pretty hyped for this release.

The story revolves around Lady, who is a pampered Cocker Spaniel, and a streetwise Schnauzer named Tramp. One day, Lady's owners leave her with Aunt Sarah and her Siamese cats while they go on vacation. The Siamese Cats mess up the house and blame Lady for it. Aunt Sarah decides to get a muzzle for Lady at the pet shop, but then Lady runs out. Tramp spots Lady and helps her get the muzzle off. And the rest of the movie is done wonderfully.

As you can tell by the title of this review, I love this movie with all of my heart, and it happens to be my favorite Disney classic, and my second favorite movie of all time, next to Scamp's Adventure. The charm of the film is at a ridiculous high, and the quality of the sound and visual experience are at its very best.

Particularly the voice acting is among some of the best in any animated movie. Barbara Luddy is the perfect voice for Lady, and it's one of the best voice overs I have ever heard in my life. Lady happens to be my favorite character in this movie, because of her voice, and she's just so freaking cute! How could you not love her? I love her personality, her design, and anything else that is good about this character. This is one of those characters that I could just reach into the screen and hug.

Tramp also has a very good voice actor by the name of Larry Roberts. Roberts is the perfect voice for Tramp, and also adds to the character's street-wise personality. Tramp also has a very positive attitude towards his life, especially since his life is poles apart from Lady's. It's also very fun to dub this character when watching this film, just like with Scamp in the sequel. Tramp is the perfect other-half for Lady.

The art value of this film could not be any more spellbinding. The animation is some of the freshest, most vibrant animation I have seen in a Disney classic. The sole Disney Classic about animals that I think has been able to do this is Bambi. The characters in Lady and the Tramp are animated very well, and move so stunningly, almost as if they were real. This is why I miss hand drawn animation, and why animators need to step up and use this kind of animation for their movies, not computer generated animation. Yes, I like some CGI animated movies, such as most from Pixar and Dreamworks, but CGI is not a very satisfying type of animation in my eyes. Hand drawn animation is much more emotional and moving than anything of CGI.

What else does there need to be discussed about the movie? This is Disney at its best, and I hope Disney doesn't stop making re-releases of their classic movies.

Also, another thing I have to point out is the trailer for the sequel that is featured on here. Best trailer for a movie I have ever seen... hands down. Go buy the Lady and the Tramp Blu Ray for any generation. You will save the world from falling into the pit.

3629980,5,B001HC7XCS,"First of all, YES, it is in its original aspect ratio, 2:55:1, just like Sleeping Beauty was. Second this film is a must own for Disney or Animation fans, so if that's the case you can stop reading and buy this (or more likely you already have).

So the main reason I'm reviewing this item is I actually found something funny about the release and I had to point it out. You put the disc in the player, the nostalgia inducing Disney intro plays and the trailers begin. Then they say ""stay tuned for EXCITING previews..."", I don't think the next words should be ""...including Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3"", lol. Films like Cinderella, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Aristocats and The Rescuers all coming to blu-ray and they want to lead off with BHC? Okay, lol, other than that this is an experience the child in anyone will thoroughly enjoy.

Story: This is a great story, it's very simple but so well done. The characters are well crafted, the story progresses naturally and it's a story that hadn't been told from this point of view before, and I argue has never been told as well in this way since. It holds up amazingly even after 57 years, the period setting of an idyllic town in the early 20th century helps give it that ageless fairytale feeling that most Disney classics maintain. This is one of Disney's animated classics that you fondly remember but you appreciate it all the more when you finally rewatch it. Given a well timed release right before Valentines Day, this is a sweet romance that is suitable for the entire family and told from the unique perspective of two dogs.

Picture: It doesn't get better. Like Bambi I find this remaster to be spectacular, I don't see how anyone could complain. Nary a spot of grain (I personally didn't spot any in in my first of what will be many viewings) and not a single blemish otherwise. The colors are true to the original but as vibrant and pure as one imagines they've ever been. It's like watching the hand painted cells move before your eyes and nothing seems to have been negatively tampered with at all. This HD transfer makes Lady and the Tramp look as if it could've been animated yesterday, the only tip off is that they don't put this much care into hand drawn animation anymore. The backgrounds are gorgeously done and the characters are realistic but stylistically animated, the human characters being purposefully the most simplistic. This film has the style of the other 50's era Disney films, it is kindred to Cinderella but the dogs are so realistically captured that they remind me of the animal designs in Bambi.

Audio: The audio is just as good as the animation with a 7.1 DTS-HD track. This isn't a film that is full of sound but all the sounds that are present are clear and distinguished, I couldn't ask for more.

Special Features: Is it me or in general has Disney not been putting as much new content on their Diamond Editions as they did on their Platinums? Perhaps I've just been spoiled but it may also be in part as they've released the films so many times by now. I will say I am very happy with the new supplements provided for this particular release. Here fans will be happy not just with the High Definition but with Disney's attempt at providing new and interesting extras that clearly took some time.

Audio Commentary: Inside Walt's Story Meetings - The best extra by far, these have been included on many recent Disney films both Diamond and not. It is informative and clearly took some time. Not only have they assigned recurring actors to play the same parts but here they have found pieces of discussion that apply directly to what you are viewing on the screen, simply amazing. These are great for those interested in film, listening to these conversations you really get a sense of Walt Disney, his team and their story crafting genius and animation know-how. They discuss every detail and always have some interesting angle for approaching each scene. They really considered the audience the entire time they created these amazing classics and by the time they made Lady and the Tramp you can see they really know what they're doing. They also make reference to several other films (Bambi, Sleeping Beauty) and discuss the state of the business briefly.

Deleted Scenes: There are three new deleted scenes. As I think people know by now most of the scenes are abandoned storyboards turned into animatics and not actual animation. There is a narrator and voice actors playing the characters. I enjoy these, here viewers get twenty minutes worth of new material (though I probably won't watch them very often).

Introduction of Boris - A long abandoned scene about two early concept neighbor dogs, Homer and Boris, who would vie for Lady's affection. This is neat to see but I'm glad they decided to go the Trusty and Jacques route, they are much better characters. (10mins Approx)

Waiting for Baby - The shortest scene finds Lady with Jim Dear awaiting the arrival of the baby. Jim Dear is seen wanting a baby boy and imagining all the things that will come. Another interesting scene but you can see how they moved pieces around and ultimately did without it. (2mins Approx)

Dog Show - Finds Lady and Tramp sneaking into a stage performance of dancing poodles where they accidentally cause havoc before making a run for it. This is mostly just bit gags. (8mins Approx)

Never Recorded Song: ""I'm free as the breeze"" - storyboards are again shot as a sort of animatic that plays as the song is heard. It is actually a great song that would have fit the tone of the film but was dropped only because they decided not to make Tramp a singing character. I'm glad to have heard it.

Diane Disney Miller: Remembering Dad - A featurette (just under 8 minutes) that finds Disney's daughter recollecting on her father, primarily an apartment he had above the fire station in Disneyland. This basically serves as a tour of that apartment as items she discusses are shown in detail as you hear her describe them and relate them to her father.

Introduction by Diane Disney-Miller - Disney's daughter gives a plug for the Disney museum in San Fransisco and tells why Lady and the Tramp was a special film for her father, runs just over a minute in length.

**Note: I have not yet used the Disney Second Screen on this item but have on past releases. I'm sure, just as on previous releases, it has copious amounts of behind the scenes drawings, animatics, storyboards, designs, etc., all of which can be accessed from your computer while watching the film (there's also games but I've never played them). On that note, I did miss on this release that they didn't incorporate any of that content directly into the Walt's Story Meeting feature on the disc, as they did on Bambi for example. I'll update the review when I get a chance to actually look through the feature.

Classic DVD Bonus Features: Carried over from the Platinum Edition are - Lady's Pedigree, a 52 minute long documentary on Lady and the Tramp. Finding Lady - a 13 minute long featurette about making a great storyboard. Original 1943 storyboard version of the film. The Siamese Cat Song, a 2 minute featurette. A Belle Notte music video, Theatrical Trailers and 2 more deleted scenes.

So ultimately this film, which was a financial success but originally overlooked by most critics, has become a classic. It is probably one of the most referenced love stories in film if only because of the simplistic genius of a shared plate of spaghetti on a first date, but it deserves much more credit than that. This is a Disney classic everyone should own and every child should watch. 5 star film making and a 5 star release.",1328918400,,7667,4.672349888806523

Disney has never failed to amaze me with the Blu-ray restorations of their animated classics. I've owned every Disney animated incarnation from VHS to DVD to Blu-ray, and the upgrades to Blu-ray have been totally worth every penny. With Lady and the Tramp, a 1955 film shot in CinemaScope, you get a pristine picture that looks as though it was made in 2012. I could not believe the beautiful colors and details that I was seeing. For example, you can see patterns in the carpets  that are so detailed that they will astound you. The sound is also very clean. Everything was produced with such care and love (colors, minute details, correct aspect ratio & audio) that I simply can't wait until future Disney Blu-ray releases become available. I think Cinderella may be coming out soon, as it was one of the previews. Even if you own the DVD version of Lady and the Tramp, treat yourself to this Blu-ray experience.

The beloved 1955 film.  Have always loved the film, great music and of course the famous scene from the film.

I have been complaining about this since Disney started this-NOT putting their classic films out in a straight DVD release the same time as the blu ray.
Hey Disney, 1. I can NOT afford more expensive blu-ray discs & 2. I can NOT afford a blu-ray player

I so hope  Disney looses sales again because of this.

Since the film begins and ends at Christmas so why wasn't this film released in November or December for holiday purchases?

You are forced to buy this when you only have a DVD player & you get NO EXTRAS so you have a blu ray disc Frisbee.  Completely useless and a huge waste of your money.

First off I was totally taken back by how amazing the quality was on the Blu-ray disc - it definitely did not look like a movie from 1955!  My 5 year old who does not like dogs actually fought with me about watching this movie so I told him to go play in the other room and that me and his little brother would watch it.  Both boys ended up so into the movie that we watched it twice in a row!  They thought the dogs were so funny!  At just over an hour it is also perfect for kids attention span.  We haven't watched all the special features yet but there is a lot to choose from.

3629985,5,B001HC7XCS,"Disney has done it again! With the exception of Fox and the Hound, every single 1080p re-release of our favorite animated classics have been given the absolute GREATEST possible transfer imaginable!! This is not a restoration, it is a transformation. The amount of detail painted into all the glorious Main Street USA scenery is breath-taking! And, for the first time ever, you can see it all! I don't care how many times you've seen Lady and the Tramp, you have not seen it until you watch this blu ray. I thought Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the Beast, and Fantasia got amazing transfers.. honestly, I think this one surpasses them all.

A few technical notes about the Blu Ray:

ASPECT RATIO:
- Yes, it is in the ORIGINAL aspect ratio of 2.55:1. No worries there!

AUDIO:
- Audiophiles rejoice! You have the option of either a phenomenal new 7.1 DTS-HD Master surround mix, or a freshly restored 3.0 option that is more representative of the original. I happen to prefer the new 7.1, but both are wonderful!

Bonus Content:
- If the new transfer doesn't sell you alone, I was actually quite impressed with the new bonus features! They include several deleted scenes, a never-recorded song, and an extremely insightful commentary track.

Overall: classic film lovers, painters, artists, romantics, movie collectors, and more - this is a required purchase. Lady and the Tramp is one of the greatest love stories ever told and, for the first time ever, given a jaw-dropping restoration that no generation has experienced before. I highly recommend it!

 Although CinemaScope was becoming a growing interest to movie-goers, not all theaters had the capabilities at the time.
*There exist two versions of this film, the difference being the aspect ratio. In 1955 many cinemas didn't have the equipment to show CinemaScope films, so besides the original anamorphic version (aspect ratio 2,55:1) Disney filmed a spherical version (aspect ratio 1,37:1) where some of the animation was redone to fit the frame.

3629995,5,B001HC7XCS,"Years ago, while studying abroad, I went to see the German language version of this Disney classic.  The English word ""Lady"" is not unknown to Germans (who were as enamored of ""Lady Di"" as anyone else), but for reasons known best to themselves no doubt, they changed the film's name to SUSI UND STROLCH.  Now I admit I had to look up ""Strolch,"" but sure enough it is one of the German words for ""tramp.""  I figured the ""Susi"" was selected for alliterative reasons.

Makes sense, I suppose, but it seemed a little odd that the name ""LADY"" was written on the German ""Susi's""  bed.  What are you gonna do?

There was no alliteration in the original English language title, of course, but it was a clever play on the song ""The Lady Is A Tramp,"" a tune which had been around for some 20 years before the Disney film debuted in '55.  That would've been a sop to the adults in the audience of course.  No eight year old would pick up on that reference all that readily.

It's not just the title though.  I often hear adults say that LADY AND THE TRAMP is one of their favorite (if not their very favorite) Disney classic.  Despite the fact that its main characters are anthropomorphic canines, the film is, at its core, a sweet love story.  Kids get it, to be sure, but adults just eat it up with a spoon (or no utensils at all if they're imitating the spaghetti scene).

And how many children's movies feature sophisticated, sultry numbers like ""He's A Tramp,"" written and sung by the sultry, sophisticated Miss Peggy Lee.  Her stand-in in the movie, is the worldly, wise-cracking Pekinese (some say Lhasa Apso) Peg, who serves as ""bad girl/bad dog"" foil to the demure Cocker spaniel Lady.

As in classic cinematic love stories of yore, star crossed lovers--one of whom is definitely from the wrong side of the tracks--are misunderstood and seemingly undercut at every turn.  Somehow true love and pure hearts win the the day, overcoming packs of vicious dogs, diabolical rats, crazy aunts, viciously cruel Siamese cats and undercooked pasta (not sure about that last one).  And then there's that nightmare vision of a dog pound.  You wonder where the PETA people came from?  They all saw LADY AND THE TRAMP as kids.

I'm sure that some clever Ph. D. candidate of cinema or popular culture studies has already written a dissertation on ""The Theme of Personal Freedom vs. Domesticity in Disney's LADY AND THE TRAMP.""  Thing is, they wouldn't be so far off.  Some of the classic themes of American cinema really do crop up in this Disney animated classic, including class tensions rugged individualism, and, yeah, the lure of adventure and freedom vs. the comforts of hearth and home.  In many ways, this is probably THE most American of the Disney classics of the mid-20th century.  It is not just another updated re-telling of an old European fairy tale.",1324771200,,2848,4.648

Lady and Tramp did and look how it worked out in the end. Happy days and pups to train to be like them and make the world a better place.

3630021,5,B001HC7XCS,"Lady and the Tramp is an amazing movie. It is one of the greatest things ever to happen in the world of movies. It even gave us a sequel that I like even more than this. But we aren't talking about that. My favorite character in this film is obviously Lady, because I find her voice and design to be cute and adorable. Tramp is obviously a likeable character because he is like Scamp from the second film. So, yeah, Lady and the Tramp is a masterpiece in every way. I really recommend it- it was a part of my childhood as well as #2.

3630025,4,B001HC7XCS,"'Lady and the Tramp' has certainly earned its high ratings. The characters are charming and fun, and those with dogs will certainly identify at least one of the dog characters. Every dog in the movie has its own original personality, though there is not much character development (which may be due to the fact that it's a simple plot...with dogs as the main protagonists). The romance between Lady and Tramp is so sweet without being overdone. As for the songs, they are not up there with other Disney songs (Circle of Life, Whole New World, etc.) but are certainly memorable--especially ""He's a Tramp"" sung by the incomparable Peggy Lee. The plot skips around at times, so there is no real plot development, but is a small ""sacrifice"" in light of this wonderful film.",1310860800,,769,4.7894736842105265

3630033,5,B001HC7XCS,"On Christmas morning, sometime around 1903-4, in a handsome Victorian house in a quiet neighborhood, a young husband presents his wife with a gift: a cocker spaniel puppy who is immediately christened Lady.  Lady grows up the pampered and beloved pet of her ""Jim Dear"" and ""Darling"" and the ward of her two nearest canine neighbors, a canny purebred Scottish terrier known as Jock and a courtly Southern bloodhound named Trusty who many years ago, before he lost his sense of smell, used to track criminals through the swamps with ""my gran'pappy, Ol' Reliable.""  Then Lady's humans learn that they are about to become parents, and everything turns upside down: they're distracted, they don't spend as much time with Lady or pay as much attention as they used to.  But the worst is yet to come: when their son is still only an infant they go off for a few days alone, leaving the house, the baby, and Lady in the care of Jim Dear's Aunt Sarah--who means well enough but doesn't realize what connivers her two Siamese cats are.  Before she knows it, poor Lady is out on the streets, where she teams up with the terrier-mongrel Tramp, a previous acquaintance, and ""puppy"" love blooms.  Tramp urges her to come away with him--""But who'd watch over the baby?"" she asks.  Then the dogcatcher descends, Lady is thrown into the pound, and it looks as if all hope is gone.  But Tramp still has a heroic part to play when a sinister rat gains entry to the house...

This has always been one of my favorite Disney animations; though the dogs speak (and who's to say that dogs don't, among themselves?), they still behave like real dogs; each is a clearly drawn individual, and the art is beautiful.  Cat lovers may take issue with the sly villainy of Aunt Sarah's ""precious pets"" (Disney gives the felines their day in the sun in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Aristocats-Special-Edition/dp/B000XUOIQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Aristocats (Special Edition)</a>, which might make a good double feature), but for dog lovers it's just about perfect.

3630056,5,B001HC7XCS,"Lady and the Tramp is probably most recognized for the song ""Bella Notte"" as Lady and the Tramp eat their Italian meal. The funny thing is I always used to hate that scene, but now I realize its significance. Lady and the Tramp as we all know is the story of lady who lives with a refined high class family and the Tramp who is a stray. If you own a dog, I think you would appreciate this movie, I was noticing the Tramp's facial expressions and movements and while yes it's an animated cartoon they were life like. But this movie really is memorable for the great voice talents of Barbara Luddy (voice of lady) and Larry Roberts. (Voice of the Tramp) The score is fantastic, and the song ""He's a Tramp"" which is sung by Peggy Lee is memorable as well. My favorite scene from Lady and the Tramp is when we first meet the Tramp, as he's waking up by the train tracks and walks around the town. I love this scene because the background paintings are wonderful, and his boastful pride is amusing.

If you own the VHS or the original released DVD, please upgrade. To see Lady and the Tramp in its original format cinemascope is just amazing. You get to see so much more and the detail is wonderful. Also, Lady and the Tramp has been re-mastered, the original images have been cleaned of grain and dirt, and Lady and the Tramp heard on stereo is incredible. This two disc special edition set also includes the full-screen version of the film but I'd recommend watching Lady and the Tramp in its original format, it's a whole new experience. Also, the platinum edition is packed with extras. There is an hour long documentary called ""Lady's Pedigree"", I learned so much about how Lady and the Tramp was created and you'll just be fascinated. Another great feature is ""the Art of the Storyboard"", it shows you the storyboarding process. Also included is the Lady and the Tramp original storyboard version of the film. If these features haven't satisfied you there also are two deleted scenes, and let me tell you I'm really glad these two scenes are not in the movie. I was also intrigued to know that there were excerpts from ""Disneyland"" TV shows, and some old Lady and the Tramp theatrical trailers. Most of the other features are very short, there is a ""Bella Notte"" music video and a interesting feature about ""the Siamese Cat Song"", it's about how they found a voice for the Siamese cats. Yes, yes, we get the typical games for the kids and activities which I would skip if you are an older viewer, there really isn't anything interesting here, but the kids might find it enjoyable. Oh, and there is a very nice gallery as well.

I guess I've said as much as I need to say, so I'll wrap this up with one last thought. You're probably looking at this platinum edition because you're considering buying it, and just let me say you won't be disappointed. Don't hesitate, if you can find this DVD go out and purchase it before it's sold for outlandish prices, you won't regret it.",1279584000,,2975,4.487084870848708

3630066,3,B001HC7XCS,"Can you faithfully review a Disney film without being denounced for ruining memories of the youth (and past youth) of today?  Can one say that a Disney film is merely ""mediocre"" without getting negative feedback?  Well, today we shall find out.  The Disney factory (using the word factory is an accurate representation) has been creating childhood favorites since the early 30s - and continue to push the boundaries of animation for children today with partnering with the hugely popular PIXAR as well as their most recent outing, ""The Princess and the Frog"".  There is no child growing up today that doesn't know the name Mickey Mouse in some form or another - and that is an impressive feat for any studio.  With that said, Disney's normal focus is animating classic fairy tales like ""Pinocchio"" or ""Cinderella"" or ""Snow White"", but sometimes they take a classic tale and rework it using common household animals.  That is the case with ""Lady and the Tramp""; my first Disney animated film to review.  It is the infamous tale of young rapscallion winning the heart of a wealthy woman, but now instead of people - we have dogs.  Made in 1955, this was probably another groundbreaking work for Disney, but watching it now in 2010, it has the feeling of being rushed, underdeveloped, and weak on story.  So, I ask again - could Disney have created a film that was merely ""mediocre""?

This reviewer will be the first to admit that the now-popular scene of Tramp and Lady eating spaghetti always pulls at the heartstrings, and was the pull-out-scene of this film, but looking at the film as a whole, it feels like it is missing that Disney magic.  We begin with Lady being given to Darling as a gift one Christmas.  She is an obnoxious puppy who desires the attention of her owners.  Through years of gift giving and love, she finds comfort in the normality of their life.  This is all about to change as our nuclear family decides to add another bundle of joy to the mix.  With skepticism abound, Lady learns to love the changes and the new family.  It is about this time that Tramp enters the picture.  Representing the care-free, baby-less, lifestyle of living without a collar, he demonstrates the power of a small community, but also shows us (the viewers) the darkness surrounding this town.  On the run from both the Pound and a sordid past, he eventually runs into Lady and one could say, ""...it was love at first sight..."".  As Darling and Jim Dear embark on a trip, an unknown relative comes to stay with two typecast Siamese cats.  Songs, chases, and rats round out this story, that goes from light to bleak to dark again as Disney creates this seemingly dystopian world for the child audience.

I am aware that we all know the story, but the recap was needed to show a point about Disney's use of class and status in this film.  As a casual viewer, many will argue that this is just a children's film - leave it be, but these are the images surrounding our children.  Lady comes from an upper class family, with no worry of consequence; she and her friends go through the day oblivious to the world around them.  Tramp, coming from the other side of the tracks (literally) represents the middle-to-lower class people.  He finds friendship in the shop owners and transients of this town.  What impressed me about this film was how dark and ill-created the lower part of town was, and Disney isn't afraid to show it.  The dirt roads, the black (or darkened) buildings, the fact that a storm arrives just as they head to town; it is night whenever Lady is away from her house.  Let's not forget as well, the rat comes out of a hole with a poster for the circus right above.  This demonstrates another transient profession that is somehow darkened by this film.  The stark use of light and dark in this film is used not only for tone, but also a world outside of the white picket fences and collars.

What is the impression handed to children with this imagery?  If you want children or the house with the white picket fence, or safety - you need to be like Lady.  While if you want to see the world, experience life without a collar, one would need to live like Tramp.  What makes this reality odd is Tramp's choice?  To see this point clearer, look at Tramp's ""friends"".  Where are they at the end of the film?  Nobody comes to visit, they could be dead (Disney handed us that bleak image near the middle of the film), while the entire time they are speaking of him as a saint and great friend.  Nobody came to bail Pedro, Toughy, or Peg out.  Was this the happy ending we all wanted?

With the undertones exposed, how was the remainder of the film?  While it carried some iconic images, the overall pacing of the film was a bit sloppy.  As this is a story with two sets of eyes, we are never quite given a full story on either.  Lady's story is further developed, while Tramp just seems to be inserted for merely the ""cause and effect"" storyline.  The voice work was decent in this film.  The 76-minute run seemed nothing like a sprint.  I think it was because I cared nothing for these dogs.  They were beautifully drawn, but more development was needed.  The ""evil"" rat was introduced twice, and represented the darkness creeping into suburbia, but it just wasn't enough to pull Lady and the Tramp together.  What did Lady really want in life?  My ending question - why was she denied it?

VIDEO:  This is a ""mediocre"" Disney film.  It doesn't have the power of ""The Jungle Book"", it doesn't have the imagination of ""Robin Hood"", it lacks the love like your ""Princess"" tales.  When looking for a stronger dog-Disney film, look towards ""Fox and the Hound"" - a stronger entry into the canine Disney world.

VISUAL:  Disney's 50th anniversary edition claims a stronger restoration of the print, while does look good.  The colors seemed very white in Lady's world, but extra dark in Tramp's life.  The darks were a bit too dark, missing some of the action in these scenes.  Also, the visuals inside of Lady's house seemed bland.  Perhaps this was another symbolic moment, but just ""ho-hum"" overall.
SOUND:  Very Good.  The songs seemed crisp, the voice work seemed bold.  This was the strongest element of this disc.  The restoration was above average, but the sound was dedicated.

EXTRAS:  Again, missing the second disc, I didn't have the chance to fully explore this DVD.  When Disney re-releases it from the Vault, perhaps I will explore the world of ""Lady and the Tramp"" further, but for now - the single disc will suffice.

Overall, this wasn't a bad Disney movie; it just wasn't one of the greatest.  I felt the symbolism was overbearing as well as the choices made to be a bit misleading for children.  The characters of Lady and Tramp seemed one dimensional at times, lacking in the ability to pull me back into a second viewing.  The songs were low-key and outside of the Siamese cats' duet, forgotten.  Would I recommend this to children?  Maybe - there are defiantly better options.  ""The Lady and the Tramp"" will always have spaghetti, but they will not have space on my DVD shelf.

3630104,5,B001HC7XCS,"Lady and the Tramp is in my book, and I mean this with the most sincerity, by far the best family film every created by Disney. Others may disagree citing other such fantastic movies as Snow White, Cinderella and others, but I have my own personal reasons for loving this above the rest which I will discuss in my review. Disney is not only a business corporation, but it's a prominent symbol of everyone's childhood and even today is putting out many great animated and live action movies for future generations to remember. However, the new Disney features will not fare in comparison to the greats produced by Disney in the 30's, 40's and 50's.

So ""Lady and the Tramp"" focuses around Lady (Barbara Luddy), a pup given to Darling (Peggy Lee) by her husband Joe Dear (Bill Thompson) for Christmas. For the first few months of her dog life she is treated like a queen, she is able to sleep at the end of their bed and gets all their attention. This doesn't last, as Darling gets pregnant and soon the new baby becomes the centre of their attention. One day when Joe Dear and Darling go away for a few days, they leave the baby in the care of Aunt Sara who takes lady to get a muzzle. Lady doesn't like this and ends up running off, meeting up with her friend the Tramp dog she had met earlier, and he shows her just how much she should cherish the life she has, even if she becomes second fiddle to the baby.

Well this is a genuinely heart warming film about love and friendship and earns its tagline of being ""His (Walt Disney's) Happiest Motion Picture."" There are no murderous witches or backstabbing friends, there is a bit of evil in the Siamese cats which is my only disagreement with the film (I'll get into that in a moment) and also the dog pound I would say takes the part of the Evil Witch or Queen. I mentioned the Siamese cats and I have to say I found it a bit unsettling to watch, and it seemed very out of place with what I felt up to that point to be a genuinely classy film. To me, these characters were, dare I say a bit racist and really appeared out of place within the film. Disney, especially back in those days is well known and mocked for its depiction of racial stereotypes, but in this day and age, these stereotypes really detract from the film itself.

After saying something negative about the film I feel I must now focus on the major positives that swallow this film and make it magical. The characters of course are the heavy influence that drives the thing along and it is obviously made so special thanks to the amazing voice acting. Barbara Luddy's voicing of Lady is utterly fantastic and fits the character and the setting perfectly. She expresses an elegance and gentle tone to her voice that seems all too fitting for the character. Larry Roberts as Tramp is also a perfect fit as he presents a cool, sly tone to his voice with a certain roughness that you would come to expect from a dog that lived his life on the street.

Peggy Lee is truly the diamond of this picture voicing a number of characters, quite favourably Darling and Peg. These characters are voiced in a way you would expect Peggy Lee to voice them. With Darling, she expresses quite a gentle and maternal voice and as Peg she presents the sassy street wise strong Lady who gives the fantastic song of ""He's A Tramp, But I Love Him."" Not only is the voice acting superb, but the animation itself is just utterly amazing to me. I don't know how to really phrase these next bits but I'll try my best. This film manages to somehow express every quality you would respect of your favourite breed of dog. The movements and the mannerisms of each breed, such as the elegance of Lady, the attitude of Peg, the Liveliness of Jock and the Laziness of Trusty are all easily expressed through the animation and could be easily pulled off without the need for voicing.

Overall this is a genuinely brilliant family film. It doesn't require any punch lines or sly adult lines; it's just great to enjoy the personalities of each canine character and their adventure. You will laugh and you will feel a bit sad, but overall you will leave the film feeling quite warm, fuzzy and just overly happy inside.",1236038400,,4197,4.431347150259067

3630119,5,B001HC7XCS,"Walt Disney's ""Lady And The Tramp"" was never one of my personal favorite films as a child.  I'm all grown up now, and it has become a very enjoyable treat for me and my entire family.  For those unfamiliar with the story, here's a brief explanation:  Cocker Spaniel Lady has a perfect life until a baby shows up.  She begins to feel neglected and when her owners take a little vacation and leave her and the baby with Aunt Sarah, she winds up on the mean streets alone....until Tramp shows up.  He defends her, has a romantic dinner with her and eventually finds his way into her heart.  It's all executed with Disney's classic perfection and littered with wonderful songs like ""Bella Notte"" and ""We Are Siamese.""

What really makes this film worth five stars is the treatment it receives in this platinum edition.  The digital restoration looks and sounds great.  The extras are some of the best I've ever seen, especially the ""Backstage Disney"" features that give animation fans a wonderful look at the development of the film.

If you're a fan of animation, this DVD is a must.  The special features alone are worth the purchase price.  Fans of light romance, family films and dogs will also love this classic Disney tale.  Highly recommended.",1212796800,,1246,4.712962962962963

There is a certain charm present in this movie that has not been recaptured by recent animated features. Perhaps it's just nostalgia, but I really feel that these golden-era animators put their very best in the creation of these films. It was something of a more personal work, especially for Walt, who grew up in a town very similar to that seen in the movie. The only recent movie that tries to bring that magic and personal touch back is Ratatouille, and I really hope Pixar considers bringing hand-drawn animation back from the grave.

Anyway, I give this edition only 4 stars because of the lousy DVD cover.",1190246400,,754,4.5777777777777775

3630136,5,B001HC7XCS,"FIRST OFF:

Beautiful, soft, colorful animation with incredible detail brings this character driven doggie-tale to life. The songs, like all great animated classics work into the plot and are a great aid in telling the story, making the film entertaining and making children of all ages happy.

BUT THERE IS MORE -- MUCH MORE: DOG'S TELL THEIR OWN TALE!

Dog's tell their own tale in this one. Unlike ""101 Dalmations"", which Disney also made several years after this film, the humans are basically not substancial characters. The humans' role is simply as a background setting for the tale of the Lady and the Tramp, which is completely appropriate for this kind of tale.

WHAT MAKES ""THE LADY AND THE TRAMP SO DARN GOOD""?

1]- The 9 ""Old Men"" were really at the top of their game when they animated the major characters of the film. In the featurette, in the 50th anniversary edition, we see exactly what these very talented guys were aiming for and some of the interesting stuff they came up with for Walt Disney.

2]- The music and lyrics are well timed, entertaining and really help set up the many varying moods of the individual scenes. The soundtrack also furthers the plot, and helps us to really like who and what we are seeing on the screen. In short, the tunes help to humanize the doggies, and in that way assist in telling a multi-level tale that means something to kids, something to adults, and something collectively to everyone. ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""The Incredibles"" also clearly illustrate that multi-level trait.

3]- The story itself is well constructed with clever while appropriate dialogue, and a very eclectic blend of characters with dogs and humans both being from a very broad and diverse background.

The small town, on the verge of the modern age, still is a special and desirable place to be in this film. Things like telephones and early automobiles are just barely hinted at in a few scenes.

4]- Cinemascope was used, for one of the first times in this film, and simply put it makes for a larger, broader world with a lot more background animation. Disney actually filmed two completely drawn versions of this film, Cinemascope [widescreen], and Full-Screen, because many theatres were not equipped to play cinemascope films in 1956.

3630164,1,B001HC7XCS,"When I was a child I was fascinated by this movie as still I am now. I won't give my opinion about the movie because it would be to repeat what has already been written by nearly everyone.
But I always kept in my memory another movie in which Walt Disney explains in a very charming and interesting way the process of making Lady and the Tramp (the storyboards, discussions with the team, technical methods, etc. and the fascinating process of the drawers creating this delightful work). It was shown on tv and I can say that, in a way, without exaggerating, the watching of these people, their style, their personalities has influenced me for the rest of my life.

When I saw that the special edition of Lady and the Tramp included many extras I didn't hesitate to buy it.

I have it now. The delivery by Amazon has been perfect, right on schedule, as nearly always. Amazon is a serious company.

But I want to express some critical opinions about this issue:
As I went directly to the extras to meet my beloved Walt Disney and sat down to listen to him, I was faced with a repulsive range of strange and ugly people who have nothing to do with the ones who made the original movie. Not only by their disgusting aspects, but also by the things they say, the way they expose their comments, the mentality, minds and the sense of aesthetics and responsibility that you can automatically feel at first watch.

These ill-minded people may own the rights to make business with what they legally own. But these people don't have dignity. They mix up the concepts of owning something with being something. They should be reminded that they are not charming, that they are not interesting, they are not important and that they are unable to do a thing like the one they bought the rights to make business with.
It is an insult to the culture and to the same Walt Disney that they appear on screen behaving like the legitimate successors of Disney (I mean successors of his genius, as they pretend). It is obvious that Disney wouldn't have had such people on his team.
Without any trace of shame they talk about the movie in a way as if they had done it, taking, among other examples, possession of abandoned storyboards and dubbing them with their voices. Don't they realise that the masterpiece has already been done? That the parts that Disney did not include were the result of a meticulous process of selection?
They mix the comments of Disney with theirs creating an unpresentable contrast and a feeling of frustration when seeing Walt Disney's expositions always interrupted.
But they need to be the protagonists of it. Their inferiority complex resulting of their lack of culture mixed up with the arrogance of the one that is economically powerful, and their little love for the country allow them to show themselves runing into the prestige of other people desecrating what is a reference to the prominence and culture, not only of America but also of the Western world.

I could extend my opinion longer but I leave it here, hoping that I am understood.

I really think that it is just a small example of how things are changing, of how the elites have changed. It is our responsibility to be aware of it and work to make possible a world in which new Walt Disneys could crop out again. If we let these people take over the world in all fields, then we can say: poor Disney, poor children, poor America and poor West.

The original movie, anyway, remains incomparable.
Disney made it for us, not they. He could, they would never be able to.

It has to be said that this review was posted in 2006. I was surprised when seeing the large amounth of people that found it interesting (helpful). Some years later the review and the opinions related suddenly disappeared. After complaining it appeared again (but without coments and ratings).

Whas it a casual incident or not?

Maybe it is, who knows, but the more I know the people I am pointing in this review (although I don't mention their name or religion), the more I am inclined to think that it was due to a meticulous wordwide process of censorship that is being carried on eveywhere, with open evidence but with the most strict silence and lack of criticism on any media (which they control).",1164758400,,4254,4.591567852437418

3630170,5,B001HC7XCS,"I fell in love with this movie when I was little, back in 1955 when ""Lady and the Tramp"" first came to the theaters, and am probably one of the few who can actually remember seeing the promo show, ""The Story of Dogs"" on the old Disneyworld TV series from the early 50's.  I actually had the rare privildge of being taken twice!  To this day, it remains my all-time favorite Disney film, favorite dog film, and continues to charm, amuse, and move me to tears.

There is little not to like about this film.  It is sweet and lovely in a way no other animated film is, and has one of Disney's most romantic scenes ever.  And if you have ever loved a dog, you will fall in love with this.  Lady is a wonderful little dog, and the sort of dog everyone would love to have. What is so wonderfully moving is that this film shows you the world through the eyes of our dogs, in all their innocence, loyalty, and loving trust.  And they can also break your heart.

One of the amusing elements that all dog owners can identify with are Lady's relationships with humans.  While technically ""Darling's"" Christmas present, she seems much more to be ""Jim Dear's"" companion, and transfers a great deal of her affection to the baby.  As for Aunt Sarah, Lady essentially avoids her.

This brings to mind the often-maligned Aunt Sarah and her two siamese cats.  Aunt Sarah is a grandmotherly woman, obviously close to Jim Dear.  I do not believe she would consciously hurt a flea, but she is a cat person, and clearly not accustomed to dogs.  Yet when Lady runs away, it is obviously Aunt Sarah who finds her in the Dog Pound.  She chains up Lady to the doghouse because she probably doesn't know what else to do with her.  And to be quite honest, her actions are understandable (when finding a strange dog in the baby's room, the crib knocked over and the baby screaming) to call Animal Control for help - before the dead rat is found in the baby's room.  In the end, it is she who sends the dogs a box of dog cookies for Christmas, knowing how she's misjudged them - even though she probably still thinks her two cats are ""angels"".

I really have to take a moment to talk about the two cats!  I hear people all the time talking about the ""evil"" siamese cats in the story, but if you've ever had a siamese cat (and I've had two very sweet-natured siamese of my own), the pair of naughty girls in the film are typical cats: curious, sticking their noses into everything, knocking things over, and largely oblivious to Lady until she chases them around the room.  I've always had a strange liking for siamese cats after seeing them in this film, and don't ask me why.  And just as the dogs are wonderfully realized, so is the sleek, otherworldly beauty of these two cats, despite their mischief.

My favorite dog in the infamous Pound scene?  The little dachshund, of course - but as a dachshund owner, so I am baised.

I love this film, and I never tire of watching it. I repeatedly get ensnared in its spell, and weep when it pulls at my heart.

This DVD edition not only gives us the film, but some wonderful extra material on the history of ""Lady and the Tramp"" in all its incarnations, and how it was made.  By all means, take home a copy today, and you too can watch it over and over.",1154217600,,3268,4.351485148514851
3630171,5,B001HC7XCS,"Lady and the Trap has been an enduring Disney classic for 50 years now and it's amazing how well it holds up after all that time.  The hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch.  This film is an example of Disney animation at its classic best.

But calling Lady and the Tramp a great animated film is really selling it short.  It's a great MOVIE, period.  Lady's idyllic life is shattered and bad boy Tramp comes to her rescue.  While he begins his relationship with Lady in the dog house (sorry, couldn't resist), he slowly redeems himself in her eyes and love conquers all in the end.  If you've seen any romantic comedies from the last several years and compare it to this movie you'll realize that a story about two dogs is actually more romantic and more funny than virtually any similar film featuring humans.  Watch Lady and the Tramp and you'll know why this film is still so loved after 50 years.",1151452800,,937,4.470588235294118
3630172,5,B001HC7XCS,"I saw this movie in the 1986 theatrical re-release and subsequently on DVD. I can readily attest that it does not age! I'm not even a dog person myself, but the plot is not about dogs per say, but the life adventures that a young cocker spaniel named Lady has.

Living with owners named Darling and Jim Dear, Lady apparently leads a pretty good life. Assuming that every dog leads the good life she and her friends enjoy, she is later shocked to meet Tramp, who lives on the streets. However, she soon realizes that he has a good heart beneath that rough exterior.

She needs his help when crusty old Aunt Sarah comes to mind the house--and the newborn baby. Initially not understanding that Lady feels protective towards the baby, she also selectively ignores the damage which her two Siamese cats were actually responsible for doing to that very elaborate Victorian house.

Amazingly, Aunt Sarah presumes that Lady was responsible for wrecking the house--and attempts to muzzle her up!

Like any streetwise character, Tramp has lots of connections and solutions to any problem which pops up. However, he does not come across as an annoying know-it-all who you would want to quickly get rid of. Tramp is instead somebody whom we are supposed to both identify and then want to hang out with in rough environments. Lady had 'gentle' friends named Jock and Trusty, but they can't help out in a world also outside of their own.

Of course, the spaghetti dinner scene remains one of the most enduring of all time--it made a VERY profound impact on me well before I was even old enough to myself consider dating. I imagined that I would eventually share a romantic dinner of my own with my own ""Mr. right"".

However, Tramp's decision to go after the rat in the nursery also remains a powerful scene. He then felt no loyalty to anybody in that family other than Lady, but saved the baby anyway! Tramp proved that class is not a matter of breeding but what you do with your self!

Despite his earlier professed discomfort with collars, Tramp ultimately gets adopted by the Darlings. Therefore, he and Lady do in fact live happily ever after.",1151107200,,2134,4.674666666666667

3630177,4,B001HC7XCS,"It's great to see such a sparkling product of the luxuriant hand-drawn animation that the Disney studios offered in the 1950's. Such artistry has been bypassed by the impersonal cleanliness provided by state-of-the-art CGI technology, but the trademark Disney warmth seems to emanate most from the combination of stop-motion techniques and a rich color palette as displayed here. As far as plots and characters go, 1955's ""Lady and the Tramp"" is not the best of the Disney canon since ""Bambi"" and ""Dumbo"" have more heart and ""101 Dalmatians"" more savvy and humor. However, on its own, the 76-minute movie contains a great deal of charm that is hard to resist even if you are not a pre-schooler.

Set in the Midwest at the turn of the last century, the story unwraps slowly and focuses squarely on Lady, a young couple's pampered cocker spaniel who later feels usurped by a new baby. Things get worse when the couple asks dog-hating Aunt Sarah, with her Siamese cats in tow, to baby sit during an extended trip. Feeling unwanted, Lady ventures out and meets a scruffy, bon vivant mongrel who shows her the world - including a stop in the back alley of his favorite Italian restaurant where to the strains of ""Bella Notte"", they famously kiss over a dangling spaghetti noodle. Elements of suspense and drama are introduced with an aggressive dog catcher and a motley, rather international lot of strays at a dilapidated pound.

The movie is so lovingly executed by Disney stalwarts Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske that it would be almost sacrilegious to knock. But truth be told, the pacing is a tad too leisurely, and the potential opportunities for Cruella De Vil-level villainy presented by Aunt Sarah, her cats and the dog catcher are not realized. What is left is a sweet, soft-centered love story with a comic gallery of supporting dogs and a smattering of songs by Peggy Lee and Sonny Burke, the two most memorable being Peg's saucy 4-1-1 to Lady, ""He's a Tramp"", and ""The Siamese Cat Song"" performed with a seething, politically incorrect WWII propaganda-style hiss. It's far more entertaining than offensive.

The 2006 two-disc DVD package celebrating the 50th anniversary of the movie's original release date is chockfull of extras, many of them aimed squarely at children including a trivia game, a dog personality quiz and a brief primer on dog breeds narrated by comic actor Fred Willard. The most interesting extra is a seven-chapter, 52-minute documentary, ""Lady's Pedigree: The Making of Lady and the Tramp"", which goes in-depth into the movie's creation. There are two other featurettes of note, one covering the storyboard creation process behind Lady and the other more intriguing, a 1943 storyboard version of the movie completely different from the final product. This film is still essential viewing for classic Disney animation aficionados.",1145664000,,2881,5.048319327731092

3630180,5,B001HC7XCS,"IN A NUTSHELL:

Beautiful soft animation with incredible detail brings this character driven doggie-tale to life. The songs, like all great animated classics work into the plot and are a great aid in telling the story, making the film entertaining and making children of all ages happy.

BUT THERE IS MORE -- MUCH MORE: DOG'S TELL THEIR OWN TALE!

Dog's tell their own tale in this one. Unlike ""101 Dalmations"", which Disney also made several years after this film, the humans are basically not substancial characters. The humans' role is simply as a background setting for the tale of the Lady and the Tramp, which is completely appropriate for this kind of tale.

WHAT MAKES ""THE LADY AND THE TRAMP SO DARN GOOD""?

1]- The 9 ""Old Men"" were really at the top of their game when they animated the major characters of the film. In the featurette, in the 50th anniversary edition, we see exactly what these very talented guys were aiming for and some of the interesting stuff they came up with for Walt Disney.

2]- The music and lyrics are well timed, entertaining and really help set up the many varying moods of the individual scenes. The soundtrack also furthers the plot, and helps us to really like who and what we are seeing on the screen. In short, the tunes help to humanize the doggies, and in that way assist in telling a multi-level tale that means something to kids, something to adults, and something collectively to everyone. ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""The Incredibles"" also clearly illustrate that multi-level trait.

3]- The story itself is well constructed with clever while appropriate dialogue, and a very eclectic blend of characters with dogs and humans both being from a very broad and diverse background.

The small town, on the verge of the modern age, still is a special and desirable place to be in this film. Things like telephones and early automobiles are just barely hinted at in a few scenes.

4]- Cinemascope was used, for one of the first times in this film, and simply put it makes for a larger, broader world with a lot more background animation. Disney actually filmed two completely drawn versions of this film, Cinemascope [widescreen], and Full-Screen, because many theatres were not equipped to play cinemascope films in 1956.

DVD FEATURES: THIS VERSION HAS VERY FEW UNLIKE 50TH ANNIVERSARY ED.

BOTTOM LINE:

3630182,5,B001HC7XCS,"Disney's ""Lady and the Tramp"" was just re-released as a new two-disc DVD to celebrate the film's 50th Anniversary. It is worthy of everyone's money and attention. Children in the family? Fond childhood memories of the film? A film student? Interested in filmmaking? A kid at heart? This is the film for you.

""Lady and the Tramp"" is easily one of the best films ever made by Disney, animated or otherwise. It combines an irresistible romanticized view of Victorian America with great animated characters and a couple of catchy tunes. Perhaps the best thing about this film is the relative lack of overly cutesy elements. Because the film is told from the viewpoint of the animated animals, they become a much more important element of the story, downplaying the tendency to make animated animals `adorable' and `cuddly' (see Disney's current ""Chicken Little"" for an example of how overdoing it doesn't work).

On Christmas morning, Darling, the lady of the house, opens a gift from her husband, Jim Dear. The box moves, wiggles and whimpers, and Darling finds a little Cocker Spaniel puppy inside whom they quickly name Lady. Lady is soon an integral part of the family and has grown into a beautiful adult dog living a happy life following Darling around and waiting for Jim Dear to come home. When Darling has a baby, Lady initially feels neglected as she no longer receives the attention she once did. The Tramp, a mutt who makes it his practice to visit many of his adult friends on a weekly basis, stopping at the Italian restaurant one night, the deli the next, takes a liking to Lady. Darling's aunt comes to visit and take care of the baby while Jim Dear and Darling are away on a trip. Her two Siamese cats, Si and Am cause mischief and Lady gets into trouble and become banished to the dog house. Can the Tramp help her?

Made in 1955, ""Lady and the Tramp"" is a beautiful, fun animated film, certain to please every one in the family. Thankfully, the DVD release features both a full screen and a widescreen version of the film. When the film was released, both anamorphic and academy prints were made available to theaters. Anamorphic films were created in an effort to battle the impending threat of television.  Watching the widescreen print, I was struck at how beautiful the film looks. The colors are crisp and bright, the images are believable and lifelike, and it just looks mesmerizing. This is the result of restoration done by the studio for this DVD.

There are two more reasons why these Disney Platinum DVDs are so important for any family or film aficionado.

In each of the Classic Disney films, the primary reason they are remembered today is because of the story. As subsequent generations watch the films, they are equally entranced by puppets brought to life, the plight of a deer, the story of a boy who would never grow up and two dogs who fall in love, in addition to the adventures of various kings, queens, princes and princesses. In the late 80s and early 90s, the studio enjoyed a resurgence creating a new batch of films with timeless stories. These films work because both audiences can enjoy them; the kids can enjoy the stories along with the adults. Because parents grew up with them, and loved them, they take their children to them or rent the DVDs for them, exposing a new generation to the magic of these films.

The story is charming. It was a stroke of genius to set the story in Victorian America. Walt's childhood home of Marceline, Missouri seems to have been the setting, feeding off of the filmmaker's romanticized memories. Not only are the settings and backgrounds beautiful, but the depiction of a simpler time is beneficial to the story. Because there are fewer things going on, the relatively simple story has greater impact. The story also calls on familiar moments in our lives. Many people have received pets on Christmas day, a little box squirming around, with a pet wearing a bow inside. Many people have dealt with jealousy and being blamed for something we didn't do. It all brings back memories of our childhood and of happier times, making the film all the more endearing.

When the story does deviate from the traditional, it does so in an exceptional manner. When Lady arrives in the pound, her fear is palpable until she meets the other dogs, realizes they are all very nice and would do her no harm. This is also the opportunity for the filmmakers to introduce another song, ""What a Dog!"" by Peggy Lee. While the song doesn't exactly fit the setting, it is very memorable and enjoyable, introducing a very timely Jazz theme into the film. ""The Siamese Cat Song"" and ""Bella Notte"" only further enhance the musical heritage of this film. I think a large number of people who have never seen the film could at least tell you something about these songs.

The film does have some racial stereotypes, but they don't seem offensive or mean-spirited. Any dog character uses the accent associated with their name. For instance, a Chihuahua has a Mexican accent, a wolfhound, Russian. Jock, a Scottish terrier, speaks with a heavy brogue, Rusty, an old bloodhound, speaks with a heavy Southern accent. Then, of course, there is Tony and his assistant. Because they are Italian chefs, they have heavy Italian accents. I think the key here is most of the characters involved play an integral part to the story. Tony is the host to Lady and Tramp's first date, including the very memorable and often spoofed spaghetti kiss. With the exception of the Chihuahua, none of the stereotypes seems mean-spirited or offensive. Perhaps you could use this as a platform to discuss this type of behavior with your kids and help them recognize why this practice is no longer PC.

The Disney Platinum DVDs are like encyclopedias of information. They include deleted songs, storyboards, portions of Walt Disney television shows explaining techniques or promoting the films and much more. Each DVD title has a second disc containing a plethora of extras. Of course, the more recent titles have more extras, but the folks at Disney usually come up with at least two or three great finds, making these discs a great treasure for film historians.

Disc Two features a lengthy documentary about the making of the film, covering everything from the origins of the story to the design of the characters to the different voices used for different characters. Each of the segments in this documentary can be watched separately or as part of a nearly hour long documentary. There are two particularly interesting extras featuring reconstructions of abandoned scenes and a different, extended version of the song ""La La Loo"". There are also the obligatory kids' games and excerpts from related Disney TV specials. There is a lot of information here and it will provide any film scholar with a good look at the making of this animated classic.

""Lady and the Tramp"" is a joy to watch, anywhere, anytime, anyplace. Since they seem to have stopped re-releasing the films in movie theaters, this DVD is the next best thing to watching it on the big screen.",1143417600,,7087,4.781045751633987

As for the movie, it's one of my all-time favorites -- all the five-star comments of others ring true for me as well. And I LOVE the spaghetti moment and ""Bella Notte""!",1142985600,,175,4.303030303030303
3630184,5,B001HC7XCS,"OK, maybe that's an arguable point, but there's no denying that ""Lady and the Tramp"" is what Classic Disney is all about.  Every element of this glorious film, from the layouts to the vocals, is spot on perfection.  And what makes this achievement all the more remarkable is that it's an original story, a true testament to Walt Disney's genius for creativity and his understanding of what works for an audience.  'Cause boy, does it ever!  There are so many wonderful scenes, it's hard to pick a favorite.  I'd have to go with the ""spaghetti kiss,"" which has to be one of the most romantic, touching moments in all of film.  And major kudos to Peggy Lee and Sonny Burke, whose contributions to the soundtrack are immeasurable.  Watching Peg the chanteuse as Peg the Pooch is pure, unadulterated pleasure.  I've had some issues with the special features on some of Disney's other editions, finding them not so special, too much geared to the rugrats.  But the extras on this 50th Anniversary Edition are everything that an animation geek like myself could hope for: A fantastic making-of documentary, as well as some lovingly reconstructed segments from the Wonderful World of Disney.  Not to mention the usual still galleries, which I always find enjoyable.  If you have a love of Disney animation, or you're looking for a fun, wholesome experience that everyone in the family can enjoy, this DVD is an absolute must-have.",1142985600,,1423,4.863070539419087
3630185,3,B001HC7XCS,"Even though it's considered a Disney classic, and contains some lovely character animation, ""Lady and the Tramp"" is one of the studio's least satisfying efforts.  The simple boy-meets-girl plot takes over half an hour to get rolling, not a good sign in a seventy-five minute movie.  Its stultifyingly rigid depiction of gender roles makes one long for Betty Friedan, and the infantilized Lady actually represents a step backward from earlier Disney heroines like Snow White and Cinderella.  Worst of all, this film wallows in racial and ethnic stereotypes, many of them deeply offensive to contemporary sensibilities.

Although ""Lady and the Tramp"" was shot in Cinemascope and Academy ratios, this DVD edition presents only the widescreen version, albeit in letterbox and pan-and-scan formats.  Image and sound are excellent.  Extras are plentiful, though not up to the wealth of archival material in other Platinum Edition DVDs.",1142726400,,929,5.416666666666667

After several attempts with that disc and one exchange later, I am currently without Lady and the Tramp.  I have no problems with any other disc, except the newly released Howl's Moving Castle...also a Disney two disc special.  I've encountered the same problem with that set.

3630187,5,B001HC7XCS,"For dog lovers of all ages, Walt Disney's new 50th anniversary LADY AND THE  TRAMP is a must-own paradise.  Restored and remastered beyond its original sound and color by the Disney wizards, this also marks the first time the 1955 CinemaScope movie is available on home video in wide-screen.  So if you have an old VHS copy, give it to charity.

Lady is a home-bound and naive Cocker Spaniel who gets involved with a scruffy, but likeable, brownish-gray mutt named Tramp.  They get in all sorts of mischief with all of the other dogs in a serene turn-of-the-century small town.  The animation and set design details are perfection.  A dark highlight is nasty Aunt Sarah and her ""We Are Siamese"" Siamese cats, Si and Am, who get Lady into constant trouble.  Another dark scene that may scare small children occurs with Lady and the Tramp in the dog pound and a parody of Death Row Warners movies.  A comic highlight has a beaver recruited to chew off Lady's face muzzle that Aunt Sarah had put on.  And a romantic highlight has Lady and the Tramp sharing a spaghetti dinner (and kiss) together with ""Belle Notte"".  The songs are lovely, never sounded this clear before, and the CinemaScope compositions are exquisite.  They have both been grandly restored and remastered.  Walt would be awed.

Disk one of this two-disk set includes the 76 minute movie in either CinemaScope or full screen ""pan and scan"" (your choice), plus a music video of ""Bella Notte"".  If you choose, you can also listen to the movie in either French or Spanish.  Disk two runs forever-there is a Games and Activities section for families that I didn't even bother with.  Backstage Disney alone runs a full three hours-unseen deleted sequences; deleted songs or alternate takes; a lengthy documentary on making the movie and another on why is took twenty years to get a workable screenplay; original 1943 storyboards that reveal a very different story with just Lady; and ""Finding Lady: The Art of the Storyboard.""

You will definitely want to add this newly remastered LADY AND THE TRAMP to your DVD library before the studio puts it on moratorium.  Shop around for the best price.  Suggested retail is $30, but you should not have to pay more than $20.  Amazon.com has it for half-price, a bargain $14.95.  Enjoy!",1142380800,,2286,4.778061224489796

The characters are charming, the story sweet without being sticky, the music charming, and the visuals are at their hand-painted best.  We have been gradually replacing all of our old VHS Disney classics with the DVDs, and it is well worth it--not only for the extras, but for the work Disney has put into restoration.

There are alot of things about this movie that make it a joy to watch for children and adults alike.  First, this is one of the first movies where Disney used someone of noteriety (Peggy Lee).

The plot line in this movie is sweet and very smart.  I think that the story does a great job at capturing the point of view of how the animals look at the the people in their lives.  The siamese cats were eerily evil, and sing the most memorable song in the whole movie.

I also really enjoyed the side characters especially the dogs.  (the scottish terrier and the blood hound)

Disney for whatever reason does not release the movie very often so pick this one up now, because it won't be around for long.",1141689600,,910,4.183908045977011
3630190,5,B001HC7XCS,"Charming to a fault ""Lady and the Tramp"" continues to be an enjoyable movie fifty years on. ""Lady and the Tramp"" tends not to be as valued as other Disney animated classics and that's because the story isn't larger than life like the whimsical fantasy of ""Peter Pan"" and lacks the fairytale charm of ""Sleep Beauty"" the two films released before and after ""Tramp"". Featuring a number of marvelous songs and vocal performances ""Lady and the Tramp"" continues to be a fun film that merely wants to entertain and it does that in spades.

 We get a full screen presentation of the film and a widescreen version of the film. Why? Because Disney realizes that the kids will probably watch this on the second TV in the house on occasion. The colors are rich, bright and alive. This puppy is flea free as there aren't any analog or digital blemishes in this marvelous presentation. The film was originally presented in 3.0 ""stereo"" with a center channel for dialogue for theatrical presentation and that mix has been maintained on one track while Disney has offered an equally impressive 5.1 remix that sounds quite nice.

The previous edition of this film looked terrific but was bare bones. This edition finally gives the movie its due. We get a second disc of marvelous extras including ""Lady's Pedigree: The Making of Lady and the Tramp"" which clocks in at nearly an hour going into everything from the casting to the design of the film and its evolution over time. ""Storyboarding Featurette"" gives animation fans a glimpse into the process and its importance to a finished feature. We also get to see storyboards produced for the film along with vintage audio discussing the story. Three excerpts from the ""Disneyland"" TV show that aired in the 50's highlighting the production of the film are included as well. We get to see performances by Peggy Lee performing a couple of songs from the film. Rounding things out we get deleted scenes some incomplete, an all new music video ""Bella Notte"" still galleries, games including a ""Virtual Puppy"" DVD-ROM feature not to dissimilar to the Nintendo game (none of which I've played of course and usually interest my children for about 10 minutes before they're off doing something else). Finally you can assess your own personality profile in ""Your Inner Bark"" and learn about real life breeds that inspired the characters in ""Puppypedia"".

3630192,5,B001HC7XCS,"I had been waiting for years for this to come out on DVD -- having only ever owned it on Beta-tape before! (What an unfortunate decision on my parents' behalf -- I can't be blamed, as I was three at the time!) But it was well worth the wait -- Lady and the Tramp is even better than I'd remembered from my childhood. It's one of the best, though I feel one of the most unfairly overlooked, Disney movies, one of the old classics that so deserved to be restored. Who could fail to be touched by this lovely story of a darling miss and a scoundrel from the wrong side of the tracks? Lady is lovely and charming, and the Tramp is absolutely enchanting. Even the side characters seem improved with age -- after all, what toddler finds the jokes based on the Russian wolfhound Boris all that funny? This story still brings warmth to my heart, making me squeal like the very small girl I still am inside. And the music! Of course everyone loves ""He's a Tramp"", and ""Bella Notte"" still makes any romantic's heart swoon, but I confess, the song I'd never realised I'd loved was Darling's ""La La Lu"" -- it's so very sweet, a tender lullaby with real feeling behind it.

Disney did a fantastic job giving this one the Platinum treatment. The visuals are more stunning than ever before, with enhanced colour and a sharper image, yet retaining the true charm and style of the older Disney movies. It isn't made to look ""super-new"" -- just shined up enough to bring out the beautiful, antique-y style. The DVD extras are also all amusing -- something that has often been lacking on Disney DVDs. It was really very neat to get a behind-the-scenes look at one of the older classics.

I would strongly, strongly recommend this DVD to any Disney fan -- it's well worth the purchase!",1141344000,,1765,4.461300309597523
3630193,5,B001HC7XCS,"As a long-time lover of this film, I had high hopes for this DVD set, and Disney didn't let me down.

Disc 1 is the beautifully restored movie, as promised, in full- or widescreen (I'm sure everyone chooses widescreen, and with good reason. The long panoramic scenes contain things off to either side that you never would've seen given only fullscreen.)

Disc 2 is the real trove of Lady & the Tramp information. It's all neatly divided up into four categories.

Under ""Deleted Scenes,"" you get an interesting sample of a scene removed from the film that would have been a little strange, I think, for this movie. Tramp conjures up a world where dogs walk around on their hind legs and treat humans as silly pets. Then after that, there's an elongated version of the baby's arrival.

Under ""Music and More,"" there's a `Bella Notte' music video and a feature on the Siamese cat song that's pretty neat. Originally there was going to be the line, ""We are former resident of Siam; there are no finer cat than I am."" I wonder why they chose to remove that, as I think it's a good lyric, and its rejection isn't explained.

The last two categories are by far the best.

""Games and Activities"" contains the DVD-ROM Virtual Puppy game. I tried it out; cute, for kids (obviously). I've seen many such adoptables online, with little `happiness' meters onscreen. I suppose the choices of Trusty, Jock, Lady, Tramp, or Bull make a decent selection. I think I was hoping to see a Peg puppy. But never mind that.

The Disney Dog Trivia Game is one of the best bonus DVD features I've ever seen. It's a rather addicting virtual board game which actually takes one to four players through a realistic board game set-up; there's a spinner, multiple-choice question categories, and spaces you don't want to land on. The board is shaped like a dog bone and has various areas for various Disney dog movies, including Oliver and Company, 101 Dalmatians, and The Fox and the Hound. My complaint is that there really should be a `hard' level, and the questions get asked over and over. The questions do range from easy ones about the most popular Disney canines to more obscure ones I've never even heard of.

The PuppyPedia video is an amusing and educational clip of Fred Willard in a dog park, and I was impressed at the variety of breeds shown.

The ""Inner Bark"" personality quiz attempts to match you with your Lady & the Tramp character profile, but while the questions are fun and have many creative answers, I've run into issues with the results. I can't seem to get anything other than Bull, Jock, Trusty, a couple of Si & Ams, and one Lady. Even when I deliberately try to get Tramp, I never do; further, I wish to know exactly how many choices they've got and who the characters are, because they've got such a nice variety of questions and answers that it would be a shame if they only used certain characters as possible results.

The ""Backstage Disney"" portion of Disc 2 is chock full of fascinating stuff, if you care at all about this movie. It's great because it doesn't just talk about things in terms of Lady and the Tramp--it feels like a brief history of the Disney studios, in relation to its other productions. Yet it does focus enough on the movie at hand.

The segments begin with a touching story of Walt's childhood and goes on to interesting discussions of all aspects of Lady and the Tramp's development and creation. You also get storyboards and excerpts from some Disney TV broadcasts. `The Making of Lady and the Tramp' itself is nearly an hour in length and presents many, many things that I did not know and am glad that I now do. My personal favorite trivia tidbit I learned was that in one old concept of the story, Lady had two suitors--a Russian Wolfhound named Boris and a mongrel named Homer. How nice to see where my favorite pound puppy came from.

Of this and countless other developmental ideas are included gallery images on the disc as well, and the remaining thing I didn't quite touch on is the section of three theatrical trailers. Normally not all that exciting, I found the oldest trailer to be quite outstanding; it actually fills you in on all the characters, in a rather historical context. For examples, Trusty is said to be a Bloodhound from the old south given to dreams of faded glory; Boris a remnant of the old aristocracy, and fellow `boy in the back room' dog pound-dweller Pedro had his `visa and luck run out at the same time.'

So I already knew this movie was an A+; but I can safely say the Platinum Edition gets the same grade.",1141257600,,4573,4.56219512195122
3630194,5,B001HC7XCS,"Lady and the Tramp-its that magical movie that I have loved since I was little (I'm only 13 here). I always thought the movie had everything. Drama, Romance, Comedy, you name it! I absolutly love the orchestra and the music (Peggy Lee is one of my all time favorite singers, so she gives the songs a fresh taste, unlike many Disney flicks). I think the animation of Lady and the Tramp is stunning still to this very day! Yes, aside from how much I love this film, Disney finally released this masterpiece on their Platium Collection line featuring enhanced audio and sound plus the best digital restoration you could possibly have! I very much enjoyed watching the movie in its original widescreen format (since I owned the cruddy VHS with full screen). Watching the whole movie again just overjoyed me so much!

Even though I had a blast watching it, there was one downside.

In Bella Notte, when the choir is singing the song, they took out the beautiful orchestra and made the choir accapella. I thought it kind of ruined the whole scene (heck, it does always make you want to cry!)

Bonus Feature wise, Virtual Puppy didn't work on my sister's computer but it worked on mine (the game is a little addicting). We were a little dissapointed that Peg wasn't put in one of the puppies to adopt! lol. The board game was a little irritating because you HAVE to have seen all of these movies to play. I love all of the behind the scenes rare footage!

The colors are sumptious, the sound superb, and it just reminds me of when I saw this movie as a child just how great these early animated efforts truly were.  The endearing spaghetti BELLA NOTTE sequence is more lovely than ever; those evil little Siamese cats and there WE ARE SIAMESE tune even more devilishly clever. And Peggy Lee's HE'S A TRAMP is still doggone great!  All the characters, from Trusty to Jock to Jim Dear and Darling never looked better.

3630197,5,B001HC7XCS,"Sometimes what happens with a classic film that you watched when you were younger was that it held a bigger place in the past than it did when you rewatched it. Re-watching Cinderella and Pinocchio recently, I noticed that I loved it more when I was younger. Lady and the Tramp though still feels special and still holds up after many years. Adding the film to the big Platinum release, Disney has restored the original aspect ratio and cleaned it up, providing the best looking film available.

Jim Dear and Darling are a married couple who gets a puppy for Christmas, a cocker spaniel named Lady. Lady becomes nice and pampered and befriends some local dogs. However, Darling(who knows what her real name is) gets pregnant and Lady doesn't get as much attention. Spending her time outside now, Lady befriends Tramp, the dog from the wrong side of the tracks. They fall for each other, only he did something that makes her mad and him potentially getting himself in the pound.

The film became a landmark since it was the first animated feature done in widescreen. Growing up in the VHS era with its ugly quality and full screen ratio, it's quite shocking to see the film all cleaned up and wiiiiide. Unlike the earlier release Bambi where you could tell the characters were put on their backgrounds, this film is more improved and the blending is seamless, not to mention it's quite a colorful film.

One complaint the film received is in regards to its sterotypes, namely the siamese cats. With that typical chinese accent, it's got that sound of people who didn't know what chinese sounded like but they just thought ""bet they're like this!"" Compare these voices to Mulan's. Then we get a scottish puppy, a german puppy even a quite stereotypical mexican chihuahua sounding much like Speedy Gonzales.

What makes the film work though is the love story. It's oh-so cute and you can't help but go aww during it but it's got issues too. Lady gets incredibly jealous of Tramp's previous girls. The girl's never heard of bad relationships? Another thing was there's an event late in the film that's quite heartbreaking so rather than having a touching and emotional ending, they copped out and ""Disneyfied it""(reportedly because Walt didn't want a Bambi repeat).

It's the best release of the film and a highlight in Disney's catalogue, although minor quibble, which there was a commentary by somebody.",1141171200,,2401,4.817961165048544

3630201,5,B001HC7XCS,"""Lady and the Tramp"" is basically about a young Cocker-Spaniel named Lady and her meeting with Tramp, a dog who lives life to the fullest and their adventures together.

It's light-hearted and adorable with no sad events like some other Disney films tend to have.

This is perfect for children of all ages becuase the animation is beautiful and the plot is easy to understand; especially, for younger children, who might have difficulty understanding more complex Disney films.

Also there are no death scenes, which makes this beloved Disney classic ideal for children of all ages.

The music is also enchanting and entertaining--my personal favorite is about two Siamese cats singing.  Children will be enamored by them; espcially, if they have a beloved Siamese cat as I did growing up from childhood into adulthood.

I saw it when I was 8 years old and I highly recommend buying or renting a copy because this is an ideal animated Disney classic that is sure to be enjoyed by the whole family.

In conclusion, this film is appropriate for children of all ages and your chil(ren) will be amused by the cute, and entertaining songs.

What must be said above all is that the contribution of Peggy Lee (and Sammy Cahn) to the soundtrack with a handful of songs and the voicing of several characters is what pushes the quality of this film far above any other Disney works of its time or ever since. What a wise decision of Walt's to employ her vast talents. For the record, by Peggy's account Disney was a kind, lovely man who she couldn't have been happier working for. Let's just forget all those rubbish demonic rumours about the great man! The legal battle over royalties Lee unfortunately had to wage against the Disney company was on the release of this film on VHS in 1988. If Walt was around he would have made damn sure she got what she deserved without all that mean corporate penny-pinching.

But for those that we saw it when we were children in its spanish version, we have met with the surprise that, for this occasion, the dubbing to Spanish has been carried out again. Regrettable! The current actors that lend their voice to the movie, are very far from the quality of those Mexicans of the years 50's. Some words have even been changed, losing all its favour. Those beloved actors of 1955, put the soul in their diction. Those of now, they recite as if they are reading a book. In short, that for those that we had liked to hear it in same spanish of 50's, the movie has lost all its charm. Why Disney have had to change the original dubbing?

3630205,5,B001HC7XCS,"The opening scene is so beautiful it makes you long to jump into the screen for a visit...we see a Victorian neighborhood, with some of the most exquisite Victorian houses ever to grace a movie screen, at night with snow falling and Christmas carols being sung softly; this is simply fantastic and a great introduction to the high level of quality throughout the feature.

Lady is a Christmas gift for Mrs. Darling from her husband Jim. At first, Lady is the apple of their eyes and the only one with the special attention accorded a new member of the family...and all is well until one day Lady finds out that soon there will be a new tiny Darling arriving soon to the household.

Not knowing what a baby is, Lady at first isn't too concerned until her new friend the Tramp paints a dark, dire picture of life shared with a human baby...""Baby moves in-dog moves out.""

Lady's neighbor dog pals, Jock and Trusty hasten to reassure her but she is too panicky to calm down.

Jock is a sturdy little square bodied Scotsman, (Scottish terrier) a true gentleman and a wee bit thrifty with his bones, which he carefully buries in his own secret spot, singing ""Bonnie Banks of Loch Loman"" in a thick Scottish accent as he hides his cache.

Trusty is an elderly retired Bloodhound who has vivid dreams of the good old days, chasing convicts for miles; so vivid his legs move and he howls throughout his dream. He wakes up and finds a striped caterpillar on his nose and it takes him a minute to realize this is not a real convict wearing stripes.

When he visits Lady, he calls her ""Miss La-dy...Miss La-dy Ma'am..."" with touching respect.

Both Jock and Trusty disapprove of Tramp and dislike him on the spot. This bothers Tramp not at all, and Lady is captivated with this rough and tumble vagabond, with an exciting life so different from her own.

After the baby is born, the Darlings have to go out of town so they ask Aunt Sarah to come and baby sit. This is very bad news for Lady as Aunt Sarah detests dogs and bings her own very naughty kitties, Si and Am, 2 Siamese cats with the devil in them.

Their first act upon entering the Darling house is to get Lady into serious trouble, and thus earns her a huge demerit in Aunt Sarah's eyes. Their next act is more serious as they make a mess in the baby's room and when Lady goes in to see what all the noise is, she gets caught by Aunt Sarah and blamed for the whole mess. She takes Lady to the pet store and makes her wear a muzzle.

Of course, this is dreadful, and Lady runs away and finds Tramp who rescues her after she is chased and threatened by a pack of mad dogs, and he takes her to the zoo to have an obliging animal remove it for her.

Once at the zoo they visit several animals willing to do the job but they are a bit too eager and far too ferocious to trust with such a delicate task.

Eventually they wind up at the home of a busy beaver (is there any other kind?) and he bites off the straps in one quick snap.

It is getting dark now so Lady and Tramp head to Tony's Italian restaurant, where Tramp is known as Butch and is a favorite with the owner and his cook.

They are served a huge spaghetti dinner with lots of extra ""meats-a-balls"", much to their delight. This scene is one of the highlights of the movie and the two dogs fall in love sharing a strand of pasta with ""Bella Notte"" being sung to them.

When they finally arrive back at Lady's house, they find a huge rat trying to get into the baby's crib. Tramp finds it and kills it, but Aunt Sarah comes in and again leaps to the wrong conclusion and screams and Tramp is picked up by the dog catcher.

Jock and Trusty rush to Tramp's rescue and Trusty is hit by a car on the way. It says much for the character of the two dogs, especially Trusty, that they would risk life and limb to save a dog they didn't really like at first. Eventually the Darlings come home in the nick of time to save Tramp and Aunt Sarah is sent packing, cats included.

Then we are at Christmas again and this time Lady and Tramp are surrounded by tiny puppies, half Ladies and half Tramps.

Jock and Trusty, healed from his injuries but still wearing a cast, come in and join the festivities.

We pull back from the Dalring house, now happily filled with dogs, puppies and people and leave them to enjoy their best Christmas ever.

Fabulous animation, from the Golden Era at Disney, and a real treat for everyone and anyone of any age. GREAT story and beautiful to see, funny and sad and exciting, has it all.",1127260800,,4513,4.287058823529412

She meets a mutt from the streets, Tramp, who comes by after being chased by the city dog catcher. They meet again after Lady escapes the arms of Aunt Sarah in a pet store because she is buying a muzzle to avoid Lady harming her cats. Tramp comes to her rescue to get the muzzle off and they go for a romantic dinner at Tony's (spaghetti no less!). They spend some time on the streets, get to know eachother, and come to find they like eachother. Lady realizes that she needs to return home, she does so, and is caught by the city dog catcher, tossed into the pound where she meets Tramp's ""friends"", and is told everything about his street life. When Aunt Sarah retrieves her from the pound, she is then chained up outside to a leaky dog house. Tramp comes by to see her some time after, and she tells him she doesn't ever want to see him again. Shortly after, Lady notices a rat come into the yard. It goes upstairs into the baby's room, and Lady tries to stop it, but is still chained up. Tramp hears her barking and comes to see what's going on. She tells him there is a rat in the baby's room, he goes into the house, up to the baby's room, and fights to keep the rat from the baby. He makes a lot of noise in doing so along with knocking over the baby's crib. Lady gets loose, runs upstairs after Tramp, but Aunt Sarah soon shows up, calling the dog pound to retrieve Tramp, and throw Lady into a room where she cannot get to the baby. As soon as Jim-dear and his wife return from their trip that very same evening, they notice a dog pound carriage outside their house. They run home, ask what happened, let Lady out of the room she was trapped in, and they all go after the dog pound carriage to save Tramp (Trusty getting hurt in the process by following the carriage and knocking it over to save Tramp). Tramp is saved, given a dog license, and a home with Lady and her family. Then they all live happily ever after!

Here are the ones they love:  Pete's Dragon, Lion king, Beauty and the beast, Peter Pan.  Also check out Princess Bride, Swan Princess, brave little toaster and Land Before Time.",1060041600,,646,4.378151260504202
3630217,5,B001HC7XCS,"The girl from the right side of the tracks and the guy from the wrong side of the tracks. This movie is about Lady, a pampered pure bred Cocker Spanial, who is the love of her owner's lives. Then a baby comes along. While this doesn't change her owner's feelings about her, they leave her with mean ole Aunt Sarah while they go on vacation. Aunt Sarah's two siamese cats get Lady into trouble and Sarah puts a muzzle on her. Lady runs away and meets Tramp, a streetwise and kindhearted mutt who always evades the dog catcher. Tramp teaches Lady there is more to life than a leash and collar.
When Lady is captured by the dog catcher, she finds out that Tramp is a ladies man, so to speak. After she goes back home, she is stuck outside in a doghouse. She tells off Tramp and right after she does, she sees a rat go into the baby's room. Tramp saves the baby from the rat and ultimatly is saved from death by Lady's owners. Shows that you can't always judge a book by it's cover.",1057190400,,978,4.207446808510638

It's a dog love story. A couple of incredible cats make a cameo appearance. That's the best part of the movie as far as I'm concerned...but then... I'm a cat lover and my three year old is a dog lover.",1043712000,,500,4.5054945054945055

She runs away only to meet a charming mutt named Tramp for he shows her what a dog's life can really be and gives her a life-changing adventure she won't never forget.

This is one of Disney's most cherished masterpieces! ever since it debuted in 1955 it became one of disney's most charming and brilliant animated movies. There's brililant timeless animation from the disney staff here especially that classic dinner moment between our title couple, fantastic voice work by Allan Reed (""The Flintstones""), Peggy Lee (who also co-wrote some of the songs), and Bill Thompson plus memorable songs like ""This is the Night"", ""We are Si-amese"" and ""He's a tramp"" makes this a must-have disney movie for anyone's collection.

This 2-Disc platinum series DVD has quality picture and sound with some very good extras like deleted scenes, games and activities, featurettes, original World of Walt Disney episode that takes a behind the scenes peek of the movie, trailers, and art galleries.

Lady is a well-bread Cocker Spaniel and Butch (The Tramp) is a free roaming mutt who has a nose for trouble. Like many of Disney's amimated movies, it can be enjoyed by adults as well as children. The musical score is typically good for a Disney cartoon.",1031356800,,496,4.573033707865169

3630222,5,B001HC7XCS,"I have often heard it said that food can be romantic, in which case ""Lady and the Tramp"" has the most romantic food scene in the history of the cinema.  In fact, it is hard to think of many scenes more romantic than that one.  Add to that one of the most mismatched couples in the history of romance: she's a sheltered Cocker Spaniel from high society and he's a mutt literally from the wrong side of the tracks.  Actually the kids will be caught up in the adventure and it is the adults who will feel the tug on their heartstrings.  Barbara Luddy does the voice for Lady while Tramp is voiced by Larry Roberts; it was the only movie he ever ""did,"" but Luddy went on to do the voice of Kanga in Winnie-the-Pooh films.  Still, it is Peggy Lee who does all the canine vocal scene stealing in this Disney film (""He's a Tramp).
Most romantic line(s): The line of spaghetti between Lady and the Tramp, of course.
Three Tear-Jerking Scenes: (1) the romantic dinner; (2) the rat attack; and (3) the heroic effort of Rusty.
If you like ""Lady and the Tramp,"" then check out these other films on AFI's list: #34 ""Beauty and the Beast,"" #53 ""A Place in the Sun,"" and #17 ""Moonstruck.""  Why?

3630225,4,B001HC7XCS,One of the best Disney movies of it's era.  I saw it in the theatre as a child in the 1970's.  The digital transfer is amazing on this dvd!  It looks almost like they used a computer instead of hand drawings.  Great job on this one Disney!,1018828800,,239,4.0212765957446805
3630226,5,B001HC7XCS,"This is one of the Disney Studios finest efforts. This film was something of a stretch for the studio, as the story was set in a more modern time period. As you know, they needn't have worried. This has proven to be one of the more enduring classics they produced, and it's so very easy to see why. The story is simple, yet effective. Lady is the family pet of a victorian-era husband and wife, who has to deal with the addition of a new baby into her home. As this unfolds, she encounters the Tramp, a mutt from the wrong side of the tracks, and they begin a courtship. Lady's owners take a small vacation, and an aunt watches over the household, bringing with her two siamese cats, and a lot of problems, for Lady. After escaping the house and the mis-understanding aunt for a while, Lady is caught by a dog-catcher and spends time behind bars in the pound. At this point we're presented one of Disney's best songs, He's A Tramp, sung by Peggy Lee. Now, I really don't want to go into detail after this, because I hate to give a movie's ending and twists away. I think one should experience the film's story oneself, and enjoy it as it unfolds. Sorry, but I'll go no further than this in the plot run-down, but really, this film has it all: wonderful songs, wonderful voice-acting, and fantastic animation work from the magicians at Disney. The film transfer to DVD is wonderful, with clear, clean sound coming from all speakers in my sound system.

That depends on who they are in a film, like a prince and a princess or in this case, two dogs, a house dog and a stray dog (which goes to Lady & the Tramp). I'm not sure if Mr. Disney wanted films to go out of stock for a long time. But this just like Emperor's Ne Groove is a short film, this runs 76 minutes long. And I'm sure that all of you know that Mr. Disney died of lung cancer in the mid 1960's. I enjoy this film because it is an animated movie.

One can't help but love Tramp, the streetsmart,charming scoundrel that he is. And Lady is adorable as a puppy, though she looses some of that charm throughout the movie. Jock and Trusty are a laugh, and you love to hate Aunt Sarah and her two cats, Si & Am. Did you know Si and Am were originaly named Nip and Tuck? Even the songs are good. Bella Notte is a lovely song, and Hes A Tramp is fairly enjoyable as well. 'Lalalu' is fairly annoying, however. Good thing it doesn't play very long. And the song at the begging isn't a real crowd pleaser either. We Are Siamese is okay... Alas - who can write a rewiew for the most romantic animated movie ever without mentioning the *gasp* Spaghetti Scene. That scene is FANTASTIC. Romantic, sweet, adorable, cute...genius. I loved it.

You have to love when ""Darling"" is pregnant and wants ""Jim Dear"" to run out in the rain for some watermelon...and chop suey.  Stuff like that makes this movie timeless.  I found it much funnier now than when i was a small child...i probably didn't even get the jokes back then...so all you people who think you are too old for disney movies, this one will prove that wrong.

How can a person with a heart that isn't made of stone watch the ever-so-famous (and ever-so-repeated) ""spaghetti scene"" and end watching it with a dry eye? It is virtually impossible. ""La Bella Notte"" is a beautiful song. All the characters are beautifully drawn, and the romance between Lady and the Tramp is poignant and believable. This is a truly welcome- and why not, essential, too?- addition to the collection of any good film viewer. Films such as these are not made anymore, and that is a pity of course.

3630234,2,B001HC7XCS,"After enjoying the classic version of this movie, which I would rate a five star movie in every way, we inadvertantly purchased the messed up ""Fully Restored"" ""Masterpiece"" version.  Throughout the whole movie my wife and I looked at each other making comments to each other like ""there it goes again, the voice changed"", and, ""I don't remember that"", while our daughter, who usually enjoys this movie to no end wandered the room playing with her Barbies.  Disney ""Fully Restored"" this movie as only the current Disney could.  They must have assumed right away that it needed alot of improvement (mistake), added scenes (to further explain the story to the audience?  another mistake), and added a whole lot of dialog (again, to further explain the story?  An incredibly large mistake.)  Or maybe this was all done to make it look more like the sequel, and to charge a few more quid.  First, the movie needed no improvement, it IS a masterpiece in its original form.  It is a classic story, told and illustrated in a very good format.  The new scenes are unnecessary, to say the least.  Our child loved to follow the story from scene to scene rivetted to the tale, the interaction between the dogs, and the action in the chases.  I know that I loved that too.  Now with the new scenes and the added dialog it is just too much.  The dialog is the most disappointing part of this tape!  The original voices are kept from the original scenes, and new sometimes very dissimilar, voices are used in the new scenes.  Peggy Lee's voice is there, and then its not.  Another voice with some random city accent is added.  The same for the other characters.  The emphasis is on the dogs and their interaction with the human characters as another creature in their lives in the original version.  Now the humans have much more of a part in the movie taking the focus away from the dogs.  The original Lady and the Tramp, Aristocats, and others were very well written and directed.  Disney took those very good movies and did a ruinous adaptation.  On the reverse side of the box it says, in very hard to read script, ""This film has been modified from its original version.  It has been formatted to fit your TV.""  How misleading!",978566400,,2217,4.611253196930947

The music and songs  are  especially enjoyable, especially ""Bella Notte.""  And the  thrilling climax (which I won't spoil for the peope who have yet to see it)  ranks with the ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion  King"" climaxes!  I remember having to wait almost a decade for Disney  to re-release this classic on video so that I could replace my worn-out  taped version.  Now that I have it on both VHS and DVD, and both editions  are in widescreen, I can enjoy it for years to come as I never thought I'd  be able to!

The romance between Lady and her Tramp ranks right up there  with some of the most perfectly realized romances ever seen in the movies  -- he is played with a breezy bravado; she with a fluffed up snootiness --  that their romantic dinner in the back of the Italian restaurant actually  has you swooning.  And the Peggy Lee-infused musical score gives this movie  its most enduring, valuable gift -- it creatively and succinctly develops  and elaborates each and every character, and imbues the look and feeling of  the movie with an enchantment that transports you to that indesribably  wondrous early-Disney place.
