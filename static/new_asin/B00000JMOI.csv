It is a clever mixture of thriller,  science-fiction and love story and it will keep you hooked until the very  end. So moving and so exciting ! Just great ! You cannot make a mistake in  buying that one !

#1-Tom Cruise had a much more interesting career and backstory

#2-Much more interesting supporting cast as Jason Lee nailed his role and Cameron Diaz made Julie Gianna much more interesting & nuts  and Nuria wasn't even attractive.

#3- Sofia seemed to flurish in the American version

1234956,4,B00000JMOI,"""Open Your Eyes"" (1997) is directed by Alejandro Amenabar (The Others, Agora). This psychological sci-fi romantic film is like a maze of hallucinations where Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) tries to make sense of his life after a car accident disfigures him and changes his life forever.

1235036,5,B00000JMOI,"Open Your Eyes is a Spanish film that has its story between dreams and reality become increasingly blurred after a rich womanizer Cesar,who is nearly killed by a his lover on a car accident.

This is a deeply complex psychological mind warp of a film that begs to be viewed more than once to get full understanding of the movie. At the same time,it takes more than one viewing to realize that it is a is thought provoking feature and allows us to contemplate to live the dream not the nightmare.

Aside from that,it is a film that really does challenge its audience's expectations and suppositions at every turn considering that the story's intersecting planes of dream and reality will astonish the viewer and would probably find it interesting as they try to comprehend the events that take place. The challenge that it brings to the viewer will definitely make one sincerely appreciate this film.",1405382400,2,899,4.7935483870967746

Especially when there is no way of telling what is and what ain't.

The guy is a jerk, at least Tom Cruise played a likable guy...this one is flat out arrogant, no real depth to him, just awful... i couldn't understand why Sofia would like him.

themes that Amenebar is addressing; What is beauty?  How much of our perception of reality is accurate?
How much of what we consider `love' is narcissistic?  How do we know what to trust?

It's worth seeing for that reason alone.  It is a dream-like trip through what is real, what seems to be real, and what can't be real, except it might be.  Cameron Diaz was good, in Vanilla Sky.  Najwa Nimri is better, in Abre los Ojos.  There are Spanish artists who do some really unique work, from El Greco to Salvador Dali to Antonin Gaudi to others, including the Spanish Bach, I can't think of his name.

And what makes this version even better is Eduardo Noriega who is not only incredibly handsome but an excellent actor as well.  ""Open Your Eyes"" is story that is quite unique because it involves future technology and that is not instantly revealed in the story-telling.  This film was directed by the talented Alejandro Amenabar who is also a writer and composer.  He directed other films like ""The Others"" and ""Agora.""

1235077,5,B00000JMOI,"This mesmerizing and original Spanish film from director Alejandro Amenabar is about the life we dream of, and the life we're given, and the manner in which it is told is nothing short of brilliant. Eduardo Noriega portrays a shallow bed-hopping young man named Ceaser who has never given a second thought to real love until he falls for Sophia, who just happens to be the girl his best friend brings to his birthday party.

Penelope Cruz gives a sexy and luminous performance in her own language as the charming Sophia. Contrasting her is Najwa Nimri as the overtly sexual Nuria, the one-night-stand who has Ceaser's shallow number and refuses to just go away. She plays on his weaker personality by accusing him of being scared to take a ride with her for one last fling and the aftermath is a mind altering journey.

An apparently disfigured Ceaser finds himself in the criminal psychiatric ward after being accused of a murder he can't remember anything about. He tries to sort through his dreams, and possibly his memories, with the help of Antonio (Cheta Lera) and begins to slowly unravel what is real and what is imagined. To reveal more would ruin the journey for the viewer. This film is a terrific thriller that ultimately becomes a heartfelt drama of what can happen when we put the emphasis on the shallow and realize the need for tenderness and love too late. It is that human element which lifts this sci-fi into good drama as well.

The performances are solid, Noriega excellent as usual, with the fawn-like grace of Cruz a enhancing a haunting performance. If for some reason you need an all-region version, this one will do. Fine editing and sets augment a unique piece of cinema from director Alejandro Amenabar, lifting this film above its glitzier American remake. The ending will linger with the viewer a very long time. A must see for foreign film lovers.",1286236800,2,1878,4.754601226993865

Perhaps because I read the complete plot summary and spoiled the ending for myself, this isn't one of those that I finish watching and think ""That is the most AMAZING movie ever."" HOWEVER, I still really love it. The acting is superb and the music is also VERY good. The movie expertly mixes surreal dream sequences and reality so well that it's hard to tell which is which until the last thirty minutes of the movie. Eduardo Noriega does an amazing job as Csar, fully understanding his self-hate and torment...and I think most viewers are left wondering at the end who the real antagonist really is. The final scene is both shocking, sad and nervewracking...a true winner underscored with beautiful music. This is one of those movies that really shows us what is going on in each character's mind and lets you really understand their mentalities thoroughly. GET THIS MOVIE!!

That is, until he meets a smart and classy artist that he instantly falls in love with. The next day, he accepts a ride from an ex-lover who then runs the car off of the road out of jealousy, killing herself and hideously disfiguring him. His mind becomes as twisted as his new face as he falls into a deep depression and psychosis before finally losing touch with reality.

OPEN YOUR EYES is smart and original, although the many twists and turns can often become confusing up until the final reveal. It immediately grabs the audience through its sharp dialog and sophisticated characters that carry the film on an emotional high from start to finish. Much of the credit is due to the intense performances by Penelope Cruz and Eduardo Noriega, who create an intimate and sincere chemistry on screen. One of the many themes the film tackles is the importance of physical attraction and looks in society, with the concept being played out through the use of masks (both physical and emotional) all throughout the plot. There are also explorations of dream psychology and alternate planes of existence that occur as Cesar's mind starts slipping, but these elements must be left for each new viewer to discover on their own. Alejandro Amenabar breaks through with this bright script and clear directorial style, and he would go on to write and direct the 2001 hit THE OTHERS.

For a while I cared about Cesar--even though he was a hound dog--elbowing in on his best friend's girl. But keeping track of Cesar is difficult: is it really Cesar? or is it the dream of Cesar? or is it Cesar after the crash? or Cesar after the crash and the facelift--not the first facelift but the successful facelift? or Cesar, behind a mask, dreaming of a psychotic Cesar with a virtual reality psychiatrist, or Cesar after he discovers Sofia isn't really Sofia:

Sofia!
Sofia, sofia, bo bofia, bonanna fanna fo fofia, fee fy fo fofia
Sofia!

And then enters cryogenics? (""Cryogenics? We're talking about cryogenics?"")

So I stopped following the story, kept watching the movie, just hoping for more scenes with Penelope Cruz. Call me a hound dog! Chapter 11 is easily one of the most sensual movie scenes ever.

Apparently he was a wealthy, very good-looking young man in Madrid, who after finding himself falling for his best friend's girlfriend Sofa (Penlope Cruz) accepted a lift from the obsessive Nuria (Najwa Nimri) and then crashed in her car at high speed, disfiguring him horribly and apparently killing her.  He tried desperately to find a way to fix his face, but now from his cell life seems all confused, and events and people jumble in a way that makes it clear that either he - or the world - is going mad.  The key seems to lie in an older, foreign man who he sees at a couple of key points in the story; finding him will unlock Csar's past, and perhaps present...

I haven't seen any other films from the Spanish director Alejandro Amenbar, best known for this film, THE OTHERS, and THE SEA INSIDE; nor have I (yet) seen the American remake of this, VANILLA SKY, but based on this excellent, challenging narrative, I certainly will.  Reminding one at times of earlier Spanish surrealists and fantasists like Buuel and Almodvar, and also at times having the nightmarish qualities of some of Philip K. Dick's novels of ""inner space"" science fiction like TIME OUT OF JOINT or MARTIAN TIME-SLIP, and some of David Lynch's work like LOST HIGHWAY, this is nonetheless a fairly original work in conception, closer ultimately to science fiction than horror or fantasy, but with a romantic-thriller feeling to it.  Noriega is spectacularly good as Csar, traversing various modes between the arrogant prettyboy, the masked felon, and the disfigured loner with utter grace; the other actors are all fine as well, though none of them have anything like the challenges that Noriega faces.  Really a tour-de-force performance.

I was not quite so enthralled by the rather flat direction, which certainly doesn't descend to the point-and-shoot character of many American action films but also doesn't really ever give us breathing space or any time to contemplate and wonder about what's going on.  The narrative may be propulsive, but the director pushes it faster and harder than he needs to, I think, and his neo-romantic score is fairly banal.  The biggest problem for me, though, is the ending, which gives an ambivalent and challenging film an all-too-grounded and prosaic finish.  Some will be happy with the wrap-it-up style, but being used to the narrative hijinks of the directors I mentioned and other modern masters like Jacques Rivette, Atom Egoyan and Raoul Ruiz - and feeling that was the direction this was going in - I guess I would have liked something more difficult or weird, something that made me say ""huh""?

Still all in all, a solid thriller with some interesting metaphysical concerns, even if it doesn't really push the envelope.  The DVD is pretty bare-bones but the transfer is fine.",1258502400,,2971,4.880715705765407
1235084,4,B00000JMOI,"Can you distinguish between reality and dreaming?  Are you sure?  If you had to choose between dying and perpetually dreaming, which would you choose?  If you could influence your dreams such that they fulfill your fantasies, would you choose perpetually dreaming over living your real life?  If you chose the former, would you make the same choice if there was a risk that your dreams would become nightmares? If you could skip the rest of your current life and instead wake up far in the future, would you do it?

These are the sort of psycho-philosophical issues explored by this movie.  Of course, this is a movie rather than an academic lecture, so the exploration of these issues is symbolized through an engaging plot involving flesh-and-bone characters (or so it seems).  In the process, a number of more standard themes are also explored, such as friendship, romantic love, lust, betrayal, revenge, punishment, social acceptance/rejection, and the influence of wealth and personal appearance (and, yes, Penelope Cruz is pretty hot in this movie).

So why 4 stars rather than 5?  Because some elements of the plot seem unnecessarily incoherent to me.  This adds avoidable confusion to a movie which is already exploring themes which are inherently amply challenging, disorienting, and maybe even disturbing.  I think this incoherence muddles things a bit and thereby causes the movie to lose some of its potential power.

Nevertheless, I do recommend this movie to anyone interested in the themes I've mentioned.  Also, this is a Spanish movie with English subtitles, and it definitely has what strikes me as a Spanish ""feel,"" so that may enhance or weaken the movie for you, according to your taste (certainly enhanced it for me).",1255996800,,1739,5.059649122807017

1235090,5,B00000JMOI,"This mesmerizing and original Spanish film from director Alejandro Amenabar is about the life we dream of, and the life we're given, and the manner in which it is told is nothing short of brilliant. Eduardo Noriega portrays a shallow bed-hopping young man named Ceaser who has never given a second thought to real love until he falls for Sophia, who just happens to be the girl his best friend brings to his birthday party.

Penelope Cruz gives a sexy and luminous performance in her own language as the charming Sophia. Contrasting her is Najwa Nimri as the overtly sexual Nuria, the one-night-stand who has Ceaser's shallow number and refuses to just go away. She plays on his weaker personality by accusing him of being scared to take a ride with her for one last fling and the aftermath is a mind altering journey.

An apparently disfigured Ceaser finds himself in the criminal psychiatric ward after being accused of a murder he can't remember anything about. He tries to sort through his dreams, and possibly his memories, with the help of Antonio (Cheta Lera) and begins to slowly unravel what is real and what is imagined. To reveal more would ruin the journey for the viewer. This film is a terrific thriller that ultimately becomes a heartfelt drama of what can happen when we put the emphasis on the shallow and realize the need for tenderness and love too late. It is that human element which lifts this sci-fi into good drama as well.

The performances are solid, Noriega excellent as usual, with the fawn-like grace of Cruz a enhancing a haunting performance. Fine editing and sets augment a unique piece of cinema from director Alejandro Amenabar, lifting this film above its glitzier American remake. The ending will linger with the viewer a very long time.

1235092,3,B00000JMOI,"Abre los Ojos (Alejandro Amenabar, 1997)

Okay, I have to say this first: Eduardo Noriega is the male lead in the new Brad Anderson movie Trans-Siberian. I don't need to know anything else, because Brad Anderson is about as close to being a god as movie directors get. If Anderson thinks Eduardo Noriega is the goods, then Eduardo Noriega is the goods.

He's also the star of the much-talked-about Alejandro Amenabar film Abre los Ojos, which everyone and his mother complained was desecrated when remade in America as Vanilla Sky a few years ago. And while I can't find anything wrong with slagging a Tom Cruise flick, I'm not terribly sure why this movie is being held up as the gold standard. Maybe it's a relativity thing; I have (to the value of my sanity, according to friends) managed to avoid seeing Vanilla Sky.

In any case, the plot: Cesar (Noriega, who, did I mention, is in the new Brad Anderson movie?) is an arrogant, handsome womanizer who meets the woman of his dreams, Sofia (Penelope Cruz). Problem is, the girl he jilted for Sofia, Nuria (Before Night Falls' Najwa Nimri), isn't too happy with the arrangement. While offering him a lift home, she commits suicide by crashing her car, an accident that leaves handsome Cesar horribly disfigured.

Now, intercut with all this are scenes of Cesar being interviewed by a doctor, so we know there's a lot more to this story than we're being let in on. And that's all well and good, except that the movie keeps raising two questions for each one it answers. At that rate, you're going to be left with a whole lot of unanswered questions when the movie ends. And that's exactly what we get. It's not so much that the film is ambiguous, which it is, but it's that the ambiguousness of the ending is the part about which we can feel we have the clearest grasp on. There's an ""as you know, Bob"" character at the end to explain everything, but Amenabar has given us a very strong feeling throughout his tenure in the film that the guy is, quite simply, lying his tuckus off. And where does that leave us? (Knowing nothing but our interpretation of the ambiguous ending, of course.)

What we do get is some rather fine shots of Penelope Cruz showing a lot more skin than we've seen from her before, a handful of really good performances (including Noriega's), and a mystery that, were it to come to any sort of conclusion, would be a cracker. Now, I'll be the first to admit that it's entirely possible I missed some small detail that makes the whole thing make perfect sense, but until someone points it out to me, 'm still wondering what it is about this movie (aside, of course, from Penelope Cruz naked) that gets peoples' juices up.

And did I mention that Eduardo Noriega is in the new Brad Anderson flick? ** ",1166572800,5,2773,4.5674044265593565
1235093,5,B00000JMOI,"Abre Los Ojos came to my attention after seeying it's American Remake, Vanilla Sky. Vanilla Sky had amazed me and had been spinning in my mind for a long time after I had seen it. Then I found this dvd of the original, and bought it here on Amazon.

When it arrived I immidiately watched it, ready to be pulled into that world which Vanilla Sky had pulled me in about a year ealier. Only this time, this movie stunned me even more than Vanilla Sky did, it captured me, moved me and gave the world of dreaming and love a totally different perspective than it gave me when I watched Vanilla Sky.

The reason?

The original is simply more powerfull than it's remake.

Abre Los Ojos is one of those movies that is everlasting. It is a tense thriller, a beautiful love story, an emotional drama, a big mystery and can even be placed under the catagory Horror at some moments.

The story is the most original and one of the most powerfull stories I've ever seen. It's complex, it's tempting, it's confusesing, it's powerful... It's everything that makes a story worthwhile and is absolutely something to remember and think back to.

The cast is fantastic. Penelope Cruz plays the exact same role that she plays in Vanilla Sky. The thing that makes her better in this one than the remake is that she has no problem pronouncing her scentences. Spanish is her motherlanguage, the language she was raised with and the language she can pronouce with pure pasion and fantastic acting. She also did a fantastic job in Vanilla Sky, don't get me wrong, but here you can feel her emotions fluently and she gives her absolute best and in Vanilla Sky you can't really feel that even though she acts absolutely great in that movie.

The leading role is for Eduardo Noriega, an actor that is absolutely convincing and realistic for the part he plays. He was a great casting choice and gives his very best. The thing that makes him believable is that you will feel for his character during the movie. He portrais his character in such a way that is only said in one word: powerful.

The other aspects of the movie: the setdesign, the locations, the lighting, the music, the cameramovements, the editing, the atmosphere and everything else is all maqnificent and leaves a powerfull impression. It helpes the story live and feel real to the audience.

Everything has been taken care of to make every small detail look stunning which helps you even more with falling in love with this movie.

Don't you worry about the language (the whole movie is spoken in Spanish), cause when you are into this movie you won't even notice that you are still reading the subtitles.

My only left advice to you is: Watch Abre Los Ojos first, and after that Vanilla Sky. I did it in the other direction and all I can say is that I think it's a pitty that I did so. So don't make the same mistake that I did and watch Abre Los Ojos first! You will understand what I mean when you will watch Vanilla Sky secondly.

So open your eyes and be moved by this absolute masterpiece of filmmaking. Yes people, this is what the movies are all about!

1235096,5,B00000JMOI,"A director friend of mine is fond of saying that you shouldn't believe anything you see on television, anything.  Indeed, the wag that said, ""The camera never lies"" would be lost in our era where the camera seems incapable of doing anything else.  The inability to believe our most trusted source of information is at the heart of Abre Los Ojos, or, Open Your Eyes, a superb film by Alejandro Amenabar.

The plot, such as it is, is readily available elsewhere.  Suffice it to say that the value of beauty, of image and perception, are the themes that drive it on every level.  It stars the near perfect Penelope Cruz whose grace exudes a vulnerability reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn, she projects an almost angelic appeal.  Her character, another woman, and two men form a rather odd four-pointed love triangle, which culminates in tragedy.  This is a fairly pedestrian tale of love gone amiss, but as it unravels clues appear that hint at sub-texts, men moving furiously behind the scenery, maintaining illusions, dreams within dreams, perceptions with more weight that reality.

As we begin to see through the layers of deception we have the sense of knowing less, not more, and yet, each new revelation draws us further in.  Multi-layered stories like this usually collapse under the weight of their own complexity, not this one.  Open Your Eyes is like a sumptuous impressionist painting; gorgeous when viewed from across the room, more fascinating still when viewed from inches away, when it is almost possible to see the hand of the master, applying his signature.

This brilliant film was sent to the Hollywood puppy mill where it emerged as Vanilla Sky, directed by Cameron Crowe.  Like all retreads, it had some virtue because the source it cannibalized was so good.  In a deliciously ironic twist, it even allowed Penelope Cruz to reprise her role as Sofia.  But Vanilla Sky invites viewers to close their eyes, not open them, in a desperate attempt to avoid seeing Tom Cruise sleepwalk through a dense, complex part requiring nuance, a word he might labor to spell much less convey.  Then again, perhaps the presence of Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky is emphatic evidence of the point Abre Los Ojos makes so brilliantly.  After all, for years the camera has been telling us that he's an actor.",1146614400,7,2298,4.8538461538461535

1235099,5,B00000JMOI,"Alejandro Amenabar has only directed four feature films-and yet his reputation as a genuine wunderkind continues to grow. Back in the early 90's-while attending film school in Madrid-he flunked out. He went on to direct a couple terrific short films-which led to his feature film debut-TESIS (1996). He gave us OJOS in 1998 and he emerged as a full-fledged film director, writer, producer, music composer, and sometimes actor-not bad for a lad who flunked out of film school.

Tom Cruise saw OJOS at Sundance, and he bought up the rights for a remake. That project became VANILLA SKY. It is an interesting film-but it pales in comparison to this Spanish original. Amenabar was hired to write the screenplay for SKY-and he went on to direct Nicole Kidman in THE OTHERS for Cruise's production company. Amenabar has been compared to Hitchcock because of the marked creepiness of his first three films. I see influences from Kubrick, Lynch, and Argento as well. He went on to break the mold by directing last year's brilliant THE SEA INSIDE with Javier Bardem.

In ABRE LOS OJOS, it was Amenabar that first turned the film world inside out and created a new film modality-blending the genres of drama, thriller, science fiction, and romance-with a touch of soft-core porn. He took us to new places that later we rediscovered in MATRIX country-places of the mind, of lucid dreaming, of cryogenics and bathos. He used classic themes-that those thin and handsome amongst us would be devastated if their beauty was wrested them. They would prefer oblivion and life within their own cortex-plugged into a super computer.

Eduardo Noriega was brilliant as the young angst-ridden protagonist-Cesar. He portrayed just the right amount of smugness, good looks, arrogance, and conceit. He was not likeable. We could see that he deserved his karmic fate. The role did not fit so comfortably on Tom Cruise. He wanted to be liked-and it weakened the fabric of the plot. Cruise could not dig deep enough within himself to find the real creepiness, the sullen callousness, and then the genuine despair. Penelope Cruz, the ""Madonna of Madrid"" played Sofia in both films. She was radiant in OJOS. She was pedestrian in SKY. Nude-she was wonderful in each version, of course.

OJOS is a treasure trove of delights and surprises-pain and thrills and passion. It is a colossal achievement from a young filmmaker who seems to be both genius and a maverick. I look forward to his next effort.",1124409600,8,2467,4.951690821256038
1235100,2,B00000JMOI,"...but I loved Vanilla Sky much more than this.  I thought that the confusion of the storyline was heightened in Open Your Eyes.  Penelope Cruz was so much more playful in Vanilla Sky, and the love was so much more magical.  Plus, the music from Vanilla Sky really blew my mind.  Honestly, having V Sky open with Radiohead's ""Everything in Its Right Place"" is so ironic but so evocative of this bizarre generation I'm from, overloaded with technology and media.  I kept trying to love ""Open Your Eyes,"" but I think Tom Cruise was just strangely perfect as the leading man.

You need not agree with me, fans of Open Your Eyes, but you have to admit that the love was so much more passionate and flirtatious in Crowe's film and that Cameron Diaz was perfectly frightening as the nightmare ex.  And how do you top Jeff Buckley's ""This is Our Last Goodbye"" when he leaves Sophia's apartment?  Under Crowe's direction, Vanilla Sky just hit me and toyed with my perceptions of reality.

1235102,1,B00000JMOI,"A very disappointing film.  Disappointing on many levels.  As you can tell already, this is a very critical review and if you wish to avoid so-called 'spoilers' then do not read any further; however, if you wish to avoid wasting two hours on an ultimately empty cinematic experience, then read on for an account of the whole dreary mess.

*

That waking reality can be difficult to differentiate from a dream is not a new idea.  The ancient Greeks dwelt upon this notion; Eastern religions ponder its ramifications; Rene Descartes made much of it; countless science fiction writers have used it for their own purposes.  Unfortunately, the director here has nothing to add to what has been said before.  In fact, he chooses to ignore the wisdom of his predescessors and actually says very little indeed.  If you have seen the film, then ask yourself what thoughts did it provoke aside from the most basic question of how to distinguish dream from reality - it gives you no conceptual tools with which to think further upon this subject.  In terms of ideas, it is a very empty film.  Indeed, it is interesting that even the positive reviews of this film do not elaborate any of the alleged 'ideas', merely gesturing, yet again, towards the 'mind-twisting' effects of the blur between dream and the real.

*

It is also empty on an emotional level.  The characters' behaviour is either poorly or simplistically motivated.  The narcissistic lead male is disfigured and his reaction is to become angry and bitter.  The Penelope Cruz character is seduced by good looks and money, and then is repulsed by physical disfigurement.  The so-called 'best friend' consistently enacts the role of a subservient 'loser', with no development.  None of this is nuanced, the characters do not develop, and the plot twists not because of the characters' motivations, but seemingly of its own accord - it is very close to being very boring, as it is difficult to care for anyone in this film.  Do you learn anything about friendship, or about love, by watching this: no - if you keep watching at all it could well be to find out the technical details of how the 'surprise' plot pieces together.

*

The acting is pretty rudimentary.  Again, this largely stems from a lack of complex motivation inherent in the characters.  It is very much a case of one emotion being displayed at a time - I'm not surprised that this appealed to Tom Cruise as he brings this kind of shallowness to virtually every role he plays.

*

The look of the film is that of a typical Hollywood big budget thriller.  The actors are good looking, their characters are rich and so can drive flash cars and inhabit swanky homes, and interactions with others are stereotypical and stupid (the interview with a panel of plastic surgeons is laughable, taking place in a huge minimalist office seemingly at the top of a skyscraper; ditto the 'gritty' interaction with the 'caring' psychiatrist).  It is nothing that you haven't seen before and that you will no doubt see again, ad nauseam.

*

Amenabar is grossly over-rated.  His films offer little in the way of ideas and even less in terms of insight into human interaction.",1117756800,12,3173,4.76007326007326
1235103,4,B00000JMOI,"What happens to a handsome, rich womanizer after  he loses his pretty face in a car accident? This is the premise of Open Your Eyes, the superior version of the fable that was made into the overracted Vanilla Sky.

To add to the plot's complexity, our anti-hero makes a deal with the devil, so to speak, a slick French entrepreneur who markets ""eternal life"" to those who will freeze their bodies and allow a scientific firm free reign over people's unconscious. The result is a lot of confusing cuts back and forth between our character's real and dream state, something that has caused a lot of frustration and confusion for many viewers. My take on the film is that you should not get bogged down too much into trying to figure out what is happening. Rather, look at the film as a moral fable, Twilight Zone style, where a nihilistic playboy must face punishment for his misdeeds in his own self-created hell. Clearly, this is a film about perdition, where we make our own personal damnation. The film reminds me a little of Mulholland Dr. in this respect. And it reminds me of a Twilight Zone episode where a crook's idea of paradise turns out to be hell. For a literary equivalent, I recommend the novel The Third Policeman, which also deals with hell as a sort of bad dream you can never wake from.

Why only four stars, not five? Because the middle section is redundant and could have been 20 minutes shorter. This film, edited at about 95 minutes, would have been leaner and better paced than the 117 minute version that was released.",1114905600,6,1542,4.579710144927536
1235104,3,B00000JMOI,"i was going to get ""vanilla sky"" but when i did the search for it the engine also pulled up ""abre los ojes,"" the original movie on which ""vanilla sky"" was based. or translated. i really liked vanilla sky. i read a bunch of the reviews on amazon and basically people were saying they didn't see much of a difference, or the original was better, etc. etc. so i took a chance. i must say i am disappointed. maybe having to read everything in subtitles took away from the cacophony of sounds and voices, as i certainly am not fluent in spanish. however, i think what i missed most was color. vanilla sky takes a painting as the basis of its visuals. the world is infused with color, so i really enjoyed the cinematography in sky. while the two movies have identical scenes, are shot very much the same a majority of the time, the treatment of light, the movement in scenes, are so much different. vanilla is softer.  abre makes everything too harsh and the soundtrack is too heavy-handed. abre took the feeling out of the situation in an attempt to build shock and suspense. vanilla sky also develops all the characters a little more, and overall, the actors give better performances, including penelope cruz. which is needed to feel more attached to the people and situation. the characters are a lot more sympathetic and human in vanilla, and there are a few more flashback montages. scenes are more fluid and put together. while vanilla absolutely could not exist without ""abre"" i was surprised to see that the remake was better. this might be budget? since ""abre"" has a sundance film logo on it, but it still doesn't change the film quality.

and my preference has nothing to do with tom cruise, either, as i could usually take or leave him.  i like foreign films. vanilla sky just seems more solid. i guess you win some and lose some.",1113609600,6,1835,4.554545454545455

One major difference for me between Vanilla and Eyes is that I felt sorry for Cesar and I didn't for the Tom Cruise character.  Cesar was a younger, more childish, and a simpler man than the Tom Cruise character and I could therefore believe in Cesar's arrogance, snobbery, and immaturity with love and sex.",1113436800,5,524,4.602150537634409
1235106,5,B00000JMOI,"I'm not sure if this movie has yet achieved classic status, but it certainly should. Open Your Eyes is the smartest, most powerful, and most important film I've seen in a long, long time. I was literally speechless at the end. Speechless! That doesn't happen too often.

Essentially, the story centers around Cesar (Eduardo Noriega), an impossibly handsome moneyed bachelor who has but a few passions, and the most pronounced of those is sex. After spending time with Sofia (Penelope Cruz), his jilted girlfriend, Nuria (Najwa Nimri) drives her car off the road, killing herself and horribly mutilating Cesar's face. Soon after, reality begins to break apart, and Cesar must try to understand what led up to his being committed to an asylum, accused of a murder he doesn't remember committing. Then the fun starts. If you enjoy having the rug pulled out from under you, trying to put together the puzzle without all the pieces, then chances are you'll enjoy this little gem. However, this movie isn't about psychological tricks at all--if you check out the liner notes for the DVD, Amenabar has a sort of mini-essay where he says that the movie is about alienation, and the opening scene is an indellible image: the city of Madrid, home of 5 million people, completely empty. It always comes to mind when I'm walking down a lonely road.

So, you might be wondering, do I see this or the Tom Cruise American remake? The answer is: this one. It's not hard to see why this movie didn't fare quite so well in America--many people here have become so isolationistic and close-minded that they don't want to watch a movie with subtitles. Then again, these are the same people who complain that Hollywood doesn't make good movies anymore but don't bother to watch independent films either. Not only that, but this movie doesn't give much in the way of closure--it can be taken at face value, but too many small mysteries abound to bring about a final resolution, and many audiences here would just as soon not pay money to see a movie if they don't know what happened. I'm not a film snob, by the way--I have enjoyed a few Arnold Schwarzenegger movies in my day (he makes a better politician than actor) and I don't bore other people with harangues on the genius of Kubrick, Altman, Cassavetes, etc. The remake, though, was far more in spirit to American cinema today--all the ambiguities and mysteries that enrichened the original film were stripped out to create a film with less feeling and far more closure. I'm actually surprised that the remake got that close, considering the studios today.

Now, my soapboxing over, please enjoy the film. If you don't mind subtitles--heck, even if you don't like them but keep an open mind--you'll no doubt be enthralled, as I was.",1108598400,10,2766,4.7824267782426775

Now, after having lived five years in the United States, I realize that, while both movies have their own special characteristics, I still prefer OYE because the main character, Cesar, is more intense and well-formed. Other acting jobs I found to be almost interchangeable, but maybe not in a bad way.

OYE is better in some ways and VS is better in others. The plot developments are explained slightly better in OYE than in VS, and I certainly loved the make-up job of the disfigured young man in OYE.

1235109,4,B00000JMOI,"I suspect the thing about well-realised non-US movies that makes them so difficult to remake for a Hollywood audience, is that there is a particular emotive approach employed in the storytelling that is also adopted by its particular audience, that simply isn't easily tapped into by most of us who (willingly or not) are tuned into the US-centric film culture.

 I haven't seen ""Vanilla Sky"". I don't particularly want to. It might be just as good as ""Open Your Eyes"", I don't know. I suspect however, that the passion that is peculiar to non-western storytelling is missing, and without that, this story would be hard to retell without being contrived.

 I was entralled by ""Open your eyes"" and its characters, who were portrayed by actors with whom I was personally unfamiliar at the time. This helped, in that the celebrity factor was not there to distract from the narrative.

 Why did ""Vanilla Sky"" bomb? Probably because it was a mature story aimed at the Tom Cruise fanclub. Mature, deep-thinking audiences don't want to see Tom Cruise. And Tom Cruise fans don't want to think too hard at the cinema. All points to Tom for undertaking cerebral projects, but both he and Hollywood have got a way to go before they'll be synonymous with anything other than overly expensive ""cheap"" cash-ins.",1090713600,5,1297,4.872727272727273

Once I discovered that, I saw the original. WOW! Typically, Hollywood takes a terrfic non-English language movie and the remake, while glitzierlacks the itensity of the original. It maeks you wonder why Vanilla Sky was even made (aside from making money!) The acting and emotions in the original movie were much better than in Vanilla Sky- even with sub-titles!  It is quite interesting, seeing Vanilla Sky first, as it's essentially the same story, except in New York instead of Madrid. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia in both movies, whcih adds to the interest- seeing her do in English and the US what she had done four years earlier in Spain!
Without repeating the story line of both movies (essentially- how can you tell a dream from reality?)-given a choice A between the two nmovies, Abre Los Ojos is the best one- though I liked Cameron Diaz as Julie in Vanilla Sky better than the woman who played Nuria in Abre Los Ojos- but otherwise the Spanish movie runs circles around Vanilla Sky.

1235111,4,B00000JMOI,"While I wouldn't classify Open Your Eyes (Abre Los Ojos) under the thriller genre by any means, this film kept me glued to the screen,and certainly gave me a good scare or two. And when the whole thing was over I actually found myself dissapointed because viewing this film for the first time is such a thrilling,suspensful journey- this film does not for one minute let you in on whats going to happen next.
Not giving anything away, I'll say that the film involves a young man named Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) who seemingly has it all. Looks,money,girls,friends-until a devastating car accident plotted by a psychotic ex-girlfriend sends him into a mental and emotional hell. Meanwhile, he has fallen in love with Sophia(Penelope Cruz,loads of charm), and the fate of their relationship becomes unknown.
I believe that whatever genre of movies you prefer, you can still enjoy Open Your Eyes. It's incredibly original, and will keep you on the edge of your seat-I guarantee. All the way through, the film manages to be both detached, in the sense you're never really sure what's going on-but it adds personal,humane touches which is what makes Abre Los Ojos a truly unique film experience.

After finally seeing the original version, I'm left absolutely bewildered why anyone thought that it needed to be remade to begin with.  This is a truly beautiful film.  Wonderfully acted and written, and done with a fittingly modest budget.  Granted, it's not in english, but I don't think the average viewer is as turned off by that as Hollywood seems to think.  (How many copies of ""Amelie"" were sold in the US???  It's probably more to do with poor marketing than actual hatred of ""reading"" films.)
I will not get into a sprawling review of the film, as there are many reviews already posted which do so adequately enough.  Just take my advice, if you found even a little in ""Vanilla Sky"" that you liked, and yet found it to be a deeply flawed film (as I did), give this version a try.

1235114,5,B00000JMOI,"'Abre Los Ojos' - or 'Open Your Eyes' - is Spanish director's Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar's master work.  Amen&aacute;bar is famous here in the United States for his subsequent work with Nicole Kidman in 'The Others,' but he first burst into international prominence as the writer and shaper of the wildly inventive 'Ojos.'
And that caught the attention of the international film set, including director/screenwriter Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise.  They re-shaped the 1997 release of Madrid-based 'Ojos' into 2001's NYC-based 'Vanilla Sky'.
Without getting into a lengthy blow-by-blow comparison of the two releases, let's just say that anyone who sees the original after the re-make has the same comment:  ""I really wish I had seen the original first.""
Exactly.  It's the far superior film.  Crowe/Cruise add nothing to it, and in fact seem to have suceeded only in totally confusing or frustrating their audience.
Although I should point out that Cameron Diaz is really brilliant in 'Sky' as the doomed femme fatale, far better than Najwa Nimri, who played the same role in 'Ojos.'",1063843200,21,1080,5.219653179190751

You get pulled through all the twists and turns of the plot right along with him.  While he's trying to figure out what is happening and whether he is losing his mind you are right there trying to decide the same things.

1235136,5,B00000JMOI,"Outstanding film.  Bought this DVD after seeing and enjoying Vanilla Sky.  If you liked Vanilla Sky, it's pretty interesting to see Abre Los Ojos, the inspiration for it.  In fact, I was surprised how closely the stories stuck together.  Scene for scene they unfold in almost the exact same way (unlike some Hollyweed remakes of foreign flicks).  To be honest, I like both movies a lot, and for slightly different reasons.  Not sure why some folks slam the heck out of Vanilla Sky and praise this to pieces since they're so similar (quite a few foreign film snobs seem to lean that way--which I don't understand since almost half of my DVD collection is comprised of non-American productions).  Abre Los Ojos did an awesome job crafting a story that was interesting and pulled the watcher in without a bunch of over-the-top special effects.  One of its strengths is just the sheer way it pulls you in with the simplicity of executing a far-from-simple story.  I do think Penelope Cruz' performance was stronger in this version.  She adds a little more depth to her character, and it feels a little more fleshed out.  Conversely I think the Nunia/Julie Gianni character (the spurned love interest in the story) is better executed by Cameron Diaz.  She injects just enough of an eery quality into her character that puts you cautiously on edge.  Najwa Nimri, the actress in Open Your Eyes, does the roll well, but with less dimension.  Another noticeable difference is Noriega's `Csar' (the main character).  In Abre Los Ojos, he comes across as more of a nave victim of circumstance.  Yes, he's callow and cocky, but not necessarily conniving.  Cruise' character seems much more aware of his circumstances and bit more manipulative.  Regardless of the differences, both flicks are way worth watching, and need to be given more than one viewing to be really appreciated. Strong performances across the board support an interesting and twisting story line that might leave you a little confused at times, but definitely not bored.  Five stars, two thumbs up, and a `hip hip hooray'!!",1048809600,92,2080,4.908309455587393

Words cannot describe my reaction to it - my friend and I kind of looked at each other at the end and all we could manage was ""Woah,"" and we're English majors that love to talk. This film is brilliantly done and both Noriega (II) and Cruz play phenomenal roles. To not see it would be an insult to the cinematic world. It makes you think about life in ways you didn't even think you could analyze it. In fairness, if you don't like to gain great insight from movies and don't want to think while you watch them, this is not the film for you.

  Penelope Cruz smokes Carmen Diaz, Halle Berry, and the rest of Hollyweed's ""hot actresses"". Too bad Hollyweed didn't notice her until she hooked up with Tom Cruise, but too good for him.
  As for the film, I won't pretend I ""got"" it, but it has to do with the effect of computer technology on the mind. As media becomes more real, how do we know, or will we care, what is really real?
  ""Open Your Eyes"" came before ""The Matrix"", has the same ideas, and relies less on special effects. It is a classic- ""The Matrix"" is a Hollyweed commercialized ripoff, and ""Vanilla Sky"" is for Americans who refuse to read a sub-titled film.",1046476800,4,801,4.4520547945205475
1235139,4,B00000JMOI,"This starts out like a love-triangle drama, with Csar (Eduardo Noriega) the wealthy scion of a restauranteur playing at love with every girl he meets.  His latest Nuria (Najwa Nimri) is very aggressive sexually, but other than that of no interest to him.  He throws a party, fails to invite her, but she shows up anyway.  She knows he's dumping her but she can't help herself and throws herself at him.  He evades her advances, notices Sofia (Penlope Cruz) who has come with his friend to the party, goes over to her and asks her to pretend to be interested in him to protect him from his stalker.  (Ah, such technique!)  Sofia is amused and interested.  And so we have our triangle.
I thought this was an interesting beginning.  I expected Nuria to become increasingly obsessive, and for Csar to fall completely in love with Sofia, who after all is played by the strikingly beautiful and bewitching Penlope Cruz, who by the way, plays a mime at one point and is seen au naturel from the waist up at another.  (In case you're interested.)  And something like this does indeed happen.  But then somewhere around the middle of the film the world of reality and that of Csar's dreams become indistinguishable.  He becomes disfigured in an auto accident or does he?  Nuria is dead or is she?  Sofia seems to cool toward him, and then to love him.  It is unclear what is going on.
Normally at this point I exit.  Notions of the supernatural or of virtual reality fusing with reality dreamed up by movie directors to be fed to the movie-going public are usually stupid, confused, juvenile, not to mention entirely unconvincing.  However a couple of things kept me around.  One, Penlope Cruz.  Actually she was enough.  But I also wanted to find out how director Alejandro Amenbar would sort this out.
I now understand that I can do that by watching Vanilla Sky (2001), the Cameron Crowe remake of this film in which (I am told) the supernatural fusing of virtual reality and reality are made so obvious that even this old guy can figure it out.  The fact that Penlope Cruz reprises her role opposite her current flame, Tom Cruise, strikes me as interesting.  And Cameron Diaz as the sexually aggressive other seems inviting.
Bottom line: Having to read subtitles causes one to miss some of Penlope Cruz's magic with the camera.  On the other hand, one can crunch tortilla chips without fear of being unable to hear the dialogue.",1045267200,,2422,4.660377358490566

We begin to doubt the sanity of the central character and then almost everything. Nothing in this film is there by accident.

Eduardo Noriega is amazing (and beautiful)in ""Abre Los Ojos,"" giving the character of Cesar a sense of darkness as well as vulnerability, not to mention the egocentricity of a spoiled child that is expected in the character--Tom Cruise, on the other hand, just seems like a movie star throughout his entire performance in ""Vanilla Sky.""  Penelope Cruz's performance in this original version is much more believable...ironic, considering she and Cruise became a couple.  The chemistry between Cruz and Noriega is much more palpable. The Madrid scenery is amazing, and there is a dreamlike quality to the film that comes from excellent cinematography and just plain good film-making...not Hollywood ""magic"".

1235153,4,B00000JMOI,"""Vanilla Sky"" is a literally scene-by-scene remake of ""Open Your Eyes"" (the American film even uses much of the dialogue) but their tones are very different.  The cheerful Cameron Crowe made a big budget Hollywood movie about success and winning.  The Spanish film is worthy of Goya, a dark fable about spiritual derangement and deformity.  After his disfigurement, the lead actor looks like a Hammer-film Frankenstein, very mangled indeed (in contrast to Cruise's milder injuries.)  He commits acts of violence on screen that Cruise doesn't, probably because Big Stars don't want to scare their fans.  Basically the main character here is a shallow fool, although one that you empathize with and root for his redemption.  Penelope Cruz plays the same character as in the remake, but here she seems much more natural and less forced in her adorableness.  The style of ""Open Your Eyes"" is cooler and more in control than Crowe's pychedelic version.  Here, everything is slightly off-kilter in a very unnerving way.  You have to watch it a second time to get all the clues about how the ""reality"" goes off the rails.  This is really a film noir; a movie about a man who is responsible for creating his own hell.  And without giving too much away, the ending is more ambiguous and potentially tragic than the American version.

In a flashback, we see Cesar (Eduardo Noriega), a rich, arrogant, womanizing, and sinfully good-looking playboy who's reputation for being a stud extends to his not wanting to sleep with the same woman twice.  He's about to turn twenty-five, he has a best friend, Pelayo (Fele Martinez), who's average looking, but wishes Cesar would get married to give him a chance at the field, and he meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz), who looks to be Pelayo's dream girl, but Cesar sets his sights on her.
Cut to the present.  We see is a masked man crouched down on the floor of a tiny room, talking to a psychiatrist.  We learn two things:  one, the masked man is accused of a murder he committed two months ago.  Two, that man is Cesar!  Whoa, what happened here?
Well, basically this.  Cesar's life takes a tragic turn when Nuria, an ex-girlfriend he has treated callously, gives him a lift and after asking him if he believes in God, drives her car of the road, slamming into a wall.  She is killed, but Cesar survives, his good features deformed so that he's the ""Phantom of the Opera.""
His life starts to turn around when the doctors who previously told him that his case was hopeless offer a miracle cure with new equipment.  His face is restored, he gets back Sofia, and that's when he's plunged into a real nightmare.
The movie's resolution is one of those that will leave the first-time viewer who hasn't seen Vanilla Sky reeling with amazement.  Things start to turn bizarre in the latter third of the movie and builds the tension notch by notch in the film's final half hour.
All the leads do well, but Chete Lara deserves extra kudos as the psychiatrist Antonio who genuinely cares and tries to help Cesar despite the latter's difficult behavior.
""Abre Los Ojos"" demonstrates once more how the foreign original far outstrips the Hollywood remake.  Noriega's face is more hideous than Tom Cruise's in Vanilla Sky and painful to look at, and Penelope Cruz is far prettier here--she looks mousey-blah in the remake.  And the resolution is not fully spooned out for the sake of the lay viewer as it was in Vanilla Sky.  Here, enough pieces are provided so the viewer can put the rest together by him/herself.

1235158,4,B00000JMOI,"This film, the original version of Tom Cruise's Vanilla Sky, is a stylish, ambitious thriller that may not quite achieve the profundity it's aiming for but nonetheless plays fascinating tricks with reality and imagination, dreams and waking, and the degree to which we can trust what we perceive, even about ourselves.  Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is a handsome but dissipated rich boy, notorious for never spending two nights with the same woman.  But on the evening of a party in his apartment he discovers that his latest conquest, Nuria, has no intention of being discarded like all the rest.
That night he falls in love, or in lust at any rate, with his best friend's date, Sofia (Penlope Cruz) and when the friend gets drunk, Cesar takes Sofia home and spends the night, though just talking.  Next morning, as he's leaving, he finds Nuria waiting for him and is taunted into accepting a ride home.  On the way she swerves off the road, a murder/suicide attempt that kills her and leaves Cesar horribly disfigured.  Much of the remainder of the story is told in flashbacks, with Cesar in the psychiatric ward of a prison--wearing a mask that looks somewhat like his original face, but inhuman and immobile--trying to piece together what has happened since, including the events that have ended with him being held for the murder of Sofia, with whom he eventually became lovers, though obviously ill-fated.
As Cesar and an immensely patient psychiatrist delve back into the past, various elements like  cryogenics, reconstructive surgery, a charismatic TV personality, the mysterious reappearance of Nuria, and a possible scheme by a group of investors with whom Cesar shares business interests all enter into the tangled plot.  Some of this is confusing and the behavior of several characters, especially Sofia, is unbelievable as its happening, but by the end these inconsistencies have been cleared up, if not the entirety of the plot, which is left fairly open-ended.
Though the tale is quite convoluted it's never needlessly so.  The whole is done with great vigor and a sure-handedness that carries the film through its most dubious moments.  The only real problem is structural : Cesar is such a flaming ... that the viewer quite enjoys seeing him get his comeuppance, rather than feeling much empathy.  This makes for a somewhat sadistic, but still enjoyable, experience as he's taught some brutal lessons about the limits of wealth and physical beauty.  One might prefer an ending that made a more definitive statement about what's come before, but the intentional ambiguity allows for personal conjecture.  That may be a bit maddening but its not necessarily a bad thing.

1235159,4,B00000JMOI,"Eduardo Noriega stars in the role that would later be played by Tom Cruz in the Hollywood remake, Vanilla Sky.
I'm not a Tom Cruz fan and did not see Van Sky. let's just leave it at that. But Open Your Eyes (Abre Los Ojos en Espana) had me fairly involved as I followed the events of the character played by Noriega (who is, by the way, absolutely beautiful) He plays a much less sympathetic character than the one in ""Plata Quemada"" (Burnt Money). (even though he was a murdering bank robber in Burnt money)
In this film he is a rich spoiled brat who owes allegiance to no one. (actually reminds me of my most recent ex-boyfriend in Spain) He meets his come uppance and is being interviewed in jail trying to figure out what happened.
The ending was a bit lacking in my opinion after the elaborate buildup of the whole movie. But I still liked it enough to see it repeatedly. It's a good film (esp if you like Noriega or Penelope Cruz) But not a great film like Burnt Money

My recommendation is to get this movie if you like films with a psychological twist.",1029369600,,1060,4.326633165829146
1235160,3,B00000JMOI,"OK, I saw ""Vanilla Sky"" first, and thought that Cameron Crowe went overboard in that one to make it much more confusing than it had to be, even though, it's almost the same movie, shot for shot as this.  But this one gets credit for doing the idea first.  That is, of a well-to-do young man who gets horribly disfigured in an auto accident caused by a jealous lover.  Or does he?  Well, it's because he's become enamored by another lady.  Or has he?  And then he kills the jealous lover.  Or is it the new girlfriend?  This is the challenge of this movie.
I will admit that watching this one after seeing ""Vanilla Sky"" makes a big difference, and now I'll probably never know my original reaction to this one had I seen it cold.  I will say, though, that even though some things are clearer because of the previous viewing, I really believe this one explains things a little more clearly, which was the problem with ""Vanilla Sky"".  Plus, Penelope Cruz, as the new interest, seems to like her man here a lot more than in ""Vanilla Sky"".
So, yes, I think this one is worth seeing.  And maybe the only debate left is in which movie Penelope Cruz looks better without her clothes in.  As the two movies are shot almost exactly the same, we ""see"" Ms. Cruz in exactly the same scenes.  I'll put my vote on this one as better for that reason also.  You get to see her in a much clearer view, and, even though this brings out the pig in me, she's a few years younger in the original.",1026777600,12,1474,4.274368231046932

1235188,4,B00000JMOI,"Open your eyes indeed...this was truly one unique film. The first twenty minutes is romance, while the rest is a psychological thriller/sci-fi...although those terms only vaguely describe it. Think of it as an EXPERIENCE...I don't think there is any way you can really give a better description of it than that.
It reminded me, like others have said, of The Phantom of the Opera, and another movie which I shall not name. However, Open Your Eyes came out before this ""other"" movie (Open your Eyes came out in 1997), so Open Your Eyes is the more original version.
This cast did a very satisfying job. I cannot say anything about how ""good"" they sound as it was in Spanish with subtitles, but their facial expressions, everything was amazing. I ESPECIALLY thought that the performance by Chete Lera for Antonio (the doctor) was incredible...He really moved me towards the ending with his facial expressions, etc. Penelope Cruz and Eduardo Noreiga both did incredible work as well, although Cruz in this movie does not have a lot more to do besides look good and smile.
This score was incredible in the movie too. As it neared the climax, it was perfect. Another seamless score by Amenabar. Great cinematography, especially at the end...quite brilliant.
This was also made before The Others, and in a way, I think of this as showing the raw talent of Amenabar, while The Others showed a much more refined style; proving that he does learn from each previous movie. But many of the ideas here in this movie also made you think a bit more. The two-face concept (in the club) was a very meaningful thing, and I also liked how he wove mimes into the movie, and what they signify. Beautifully thought out, and shown.
This movie seems a bit ""disjointed"" and although everything was good, it just had that feeling to it that made it seem a bit ""scatterbrained"". This is not a big thing, just something I noticed.
Like Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said about Vanilla Sky-the American remake of this, this movie has ""mind bending secrets"" that ""no reviewer should give away"", and I think this also applies to this movie. My advice to you is to see this before those secrets are given away by some other review. However, I do have to say that I did guess at some of the secrets, and I did come pretty darn close...but it is still an excellent film that was certainly very original (at the time anyway).
I hope Vanilla Sky is as good, just for the sake of introducing movies like these to the North American cinema. I was saddened to find out that Amenabar's beautiful music won't be gracing the new version, however I am confident that Crowe will add his own touch, as I have heard he is quite brilliant choosing/using music in his movies.
I know most of this review didn't really deal too much with the concepts of the movie, but I didn't want to say anything...there were many examples of each thing (the cinematography, the score at its climax, etc...) that I wanted to talk about, but I shouldn't because this is a film that you can barely talk about without giving away something...so all I can really say is see this movie.
Open your eyes...and see the brilliance of Abre Los Ojos.

1235192,4,B00000JMOI,This was a real surprise movie to me. In a way it feels like a Bunuel movie and the surrealism is very good described and you have to be concentrated all the way to understand when the movie is reality or dream. This is a must see if you like movies that challenges you.,1020556800,4,270,4.018518518518518
1235193,3,B00000JMOI,"In all three Alejandro Amenebar films ('Thesis', 'Open Your Eyes' and 'The Others'), the hero or heroine is introduced as part of a sharply defined background (be it a house, family, lifestyle or whatever), and put through a plot in which everything s/he takes for granted, everything s/he takes for 'normal' and 'real' is undermined.  Their disorientation is shared by the viewers, not in the usual sense of empathising with the characters and vicariously experiencing their ordeals (Amenebar characters are usually unlikable or unyielding), but in having to negotiate a narrative in which the traditional elements and boundaries - character, plot, reality, time, place, image, motivation - are ineradicably displaced.  Just as the lead can't tell whether what is happening is real or dream, whether the person standing beside him is a friend or mental projection, so the viewer is confronted with the unstable status of every frame.
The lead in 'Open Your Eyes' is a man who lives his life by appearances - the trappings of wealth; the beauty of one night stands; the reflection of his own good looks - who finds his life overturned by appearances.  In true 'Fatal Attraction' style, his masculine crises are caused by the revenge of a lover he very publicly dumped and humiliated.  The subsequent narrative can be seen as a (Catholic?) morality tale in which the hero is put through a purgatorial nightmare as punishment for material complacency and indifference to other people, with Penelope Cruz as a kind of redemptive angel, the Beatrice who will guide him to Paradise.
Not quite.  'Open' is a vast improvement on Amenebar's debut 'Thesis', even if it doesn't quite achieve the perfection of 'The Others'.  Mystery and ambiguity are expertly and plausibly generated from the start - a disembodied voice whispering 'open your eyes' over a blank screen - so its seems a shame that, like the earlier film, the final quarter opts for the preposterous and excessive in the move to resolution.  Amenebar's grasp of tone and mise-en-scene is much more assured; environment, for instance, is more than just a setting or pat signifer, and plays into the weird mechanism of the story and its themes.
Amenebar reminds us that, although Surrealism was a French movement, some of its greatest exponents (especially Bunuel) were Spanish.  'Eyes', er, opens with a famous dream sequence, in which the self-confident young hero in his expensive car gradually realises that the capital city centre he drives through is empty.  More fundamentally, Amenebar's film collapses the boundary between unconscious and conscious, dream and reality, and subverts the role of the Freudian psychoanalyst: instead of shaping and interpreting the patient's unconscious, he gets sucked into it.  One frame, a naked, headless female corpse, would have made a fine Surrealist photograph.
Amenebar's narrative trickery could have fallen on its face if, as a Hollywood movie might do, he had spent too long building up his hero, his background and his 'motivation'.  By imposing the plot-scuppering flash-forwards from the beginning, but leaving the details about the lead character sketchy, the shifts and tricks become more acceptable, because 'reality' has been shaken from the start.  Still, I wish Julio Medem had got his hands on this material - what a film that might have been.
A small anecdote to illustrate the ambiguous power of 'Eyes':  I was made watch it by my wife, who has become recently enamoured of dashing young actor Eduardo Noriega.  Five minutes into the grotesque facial disfigurment that results from the pivotal kamikaze car crash, she felt genuinely nauseous and had to lie down.  I don't know what to think about that one...",1020124800,3,3724,5.132231404958677
1235194,1,B00000JMOI,"This movie is too ambitious, tries to say too much but with lack of real substance. The script seems to have been written by a teenager, raised by MTV culture.

It started out with a rich handsome playboy/ladies man getting horribly disfigured in an automobile accident (actually a suicide by a mentally imbalanced woman friend).  I thought the film would deal with his post-disfigurement adjustment and life experiences.  I suppose this would have been like countless other films dealing with  a person's adjustment after terrible disfigurement. However, this film heads in an entirely different direction.  This is where it drops the ball and becomes too confusing.  It was a nice try, but no cigar.  Apparently, the character has been frozen for 150 years by using cryogenics, and he has very confusing dreams. One never knows what is real and what is a dream.  This could have been a good film because it has basically a good sci-fi premise. But the film seems to get lost and does not carry through cohesively.  Much too confusing to be enjoyable.

1235221,5,B00000JMOI,"Amenabar (and his associate Medem) are clearly erudite fans of literate SF and there can be little question that Abre tus Ojos was heavily influenced by Philip Kendred Dick's UBIK. (Avail. in the book area - go buy it.)  The confusion over life and death and the brilliant incarnation of PKDs Dark Haired Girl by Najwa Nimri seem to seal it.  Of course in Vanilla Sky, the same character is blonde Cameron Diaz (who finally demonstrated in John Malkovitch that she could act.) In Blade Runner, Pris, PKD's clearest written incarnation of this symbol, was played by blonde Darryl Hannah, and in Total Recall (blech) by blonde Sharon Stone.
This won't matter to the 99.9% of the viewers unfamiliar with PKDs brilliant literature, but the symbol of The Dark Haired Girl is so central to PKDs fiction and outlook on life that they are missing out on a whole alternative layer of meaning.
The Dark Haired Girl was only portrayed once by a dark haired actress in a full on adaptation, by Anne Brochet in (Confessions d'un) Barjo the film version of Confessions of a Crap Artist (available under books - go buy it.)  (ATT: Image Video since you seem to be the only people really trying, please put this out on DVD.)
I can think offhand of two other films with avatars of Pris.  Medem's Tierra (buy it, and excuse me, but WHY isn't Los Amantes del Circulo Polar on DVD???) has a wonderful performance by Silke Klein as Mari.
This is more of a stretch (besides crossing both the Atlantic and the Equator) but since Argentinian Eliseo Subiela's Hombre Mirando al Sudeste (DVD, please) was very PKD in tone and had a character named Beatriz Dick, the character of Death, played by raven haired Nacha Guevara, in his Lado Oscuro del Corazon (DVD PLEASE)is a good candidate.

Although less technically savvy and a lot quieter than Vanilla Sky (I actually missed Crowe's use of music), this Spanish language version is definetely worth seeing.

It was nice to see the original version of what is arguably one of the most interesting films to come out in the last couple of years. This film is destined to become a classic, like Vanilla Sky in its own right.
The DVD has a small, four page commentary on the film and its meaning, or at least the meaning that Amenabar intended. I found that interesting, as well as the short cast biographies/filmographies. I was very impressed with Cruz(again) and Noriega, and plan to see more films starring them.

1235229,4,B00000JMOI,"Alejandro Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes (Abre Los Ojos)"" operates on the notion that dreams and reality walk hand-in-hand down the path of life. It deals with elements of psychological bliss and disturbance in ways reminiscent of Hitchcock and ""The Twilight Zone,"" evoking a tone of constant underlying dread that remains in the mind long after the movie's earth-shattering climax. This isn't a thriller in the traditional sense, but its thought-provoking plot is a testament to Amenabar's superb storytelling capability.
The film begins normally enough by introducing us to Csar (played by Eduardo Noriega), a wealthy man with popularity and good looks tucked under his sleeve. He's got a best friend, Pelayo (Fele Martnez), who takes pleasure in chiding him about his involvement with the persistent Nuria (Najwa Nimri), who simply won't take no for an answer when it appears that Csar has lost interest in her. His birthday party marks the start of a new relationship with the lovely and high-spirited Sofia (Penlope Cruz), yet his reservations about moving too fast with her further infuriate Nuria, who offers him a ride back to his apartment the following morning only to run the both of them down a hillside into a wall.
The accident leaves Nuria dead and Csar badly injured, with facial scars untreatable by his physicians, who try to convince him of the risks involved in attempting to return his face to its former state. His disfigurement is a burden to him, as well as to Sofia and Pelayo, who find discomfort not in his looks, but in his downtrodden attitude and outlook on his future. Noriega captures this lapse in emotion quite wonderfully, while also sharing a great chemistry with Cruz which keeps us involved with the romantic aspect of the story as well as the forthcoming mystery.
The movie soon reaches a point where everything seems to change... Csar finds himself in the arms of Sofia, sharing a love he never thought possible; his doctors have come up with a solution to his facial scars, restoring his face back to its handsome look. Everything seems to be going quite well for him, until one night he finds Nuria in his bed and his happy life turned upside down by his friends, who persist in telling him that this woman he clearly despises is Sofia.
The story is good at keeping its audience at bay for information and twists, casting us into a darkness so that Csar's confusion and delirium soon becomes our own as well. His struggle to recover the clues that will solve the mystery behind his life's sudden downfall is intriguing and effectively induces thought among viewers, who will no doubt find themselves recalling clues, piecing together scenes and characters, lines of dialogue and different objects Csar has come in contact with. It's all a sense of mystifying wonderment, and Amenabar is able to lay on plot twist after plot twist at just the right pace so that we hunger for more.
Your acceptance of the movie's final resolution ultimately depends on your willingness to suspend disbelief, as well as your scrutiny. It begs its audience to question its intentions, to ask why certain events have come to pass, why certain characters thought to be dead have come back to haunt Csar; I think most people will be inclined to ask one question (SPOILER ALERT): If Csar has been creating his own world, then why does he torture himself with his past? This is a question the movie doesn't answer forthright; perhaps it is better left unanswered, as it most likely will take away from the impact the final twist will have.
As I finish this review, I still find myself perplexed by the complex nature and stunning array of twists and surprises that Amenabar supplies his film with. As I watched the film, I found myself straying away from its conclusion, but upon further thought, I realize that it serves the purpose of tying the film together in a manner that does justice to the story that leads up to it. I still have my reservations about the nature of Csar's final state of mind, but the effectiveness of the overall film easily makes it a minor flaw.",1008374400,64,4086,4.8053977272727275

1235248,5,B00000JMOI,"I've just watched Open Your Eyes for the second time and I still think that I'm missing some points in the film. Open... has a complex plot that stats very slowly just like any romantic ordinary movie. Then out of the blue, it has twist that makes for a very dark and complex psicological thriller. After that you bit your nails desperate to get any clue of what's going on. And you don't get it until the very last minutes.
Writing more about it I would give away important points and I don't mean to steal all the surprise of  those who haven't seen it yet. The cast is very good. I have never noticed how good Pen&eacute;lope Cruz is. When she speaks in Spanish, she can deliver her character much better than in English.
It's largely known that Tom Cruise has remade the film with Cameron Crowe directing and Cruz reprising her role. By this time there's no much to be said. The trailer looks nice and very close to the original picture. We have to wait...
And, last but not least, mark the name Alejandro Amenabar. This guy has made good films in Spanish and one of the best 2001 movie in English, ""The Others"", which is his debut in English. I can hardly wait to see more of his films. He is very imaginative and his movies have a dark appeal that we haven't seen alike lately.",1006992000,2,1283,4.345833333333333

However, i did find a couple errors, mainly on the cast bios and the like. I assume that's why they re-released it (as of now, the dvd is set to be released on december, while it was originally released last august). If on Amenabar's filmography you've got a ""The Darkness (2001)"" (should be The Others), that's the first version right there.
It goes without saying Open Your Eyes is a superb movie. If you haven't seen it yet (which i honestly doubt if you're here reading the dvd reviews), go get your hands on a copy. You won't regret it.",1006128000,,785,4.346938775510204
1235251,5,B00000JMOI,"This second feature by Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar, Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) is a virtual remake of Hitchcock's Vertigo. Like that film, it dazzles us for a good portion of its running time by never letting us know exactly where we stand. Both films share a questioning of reality as they slide deeper and deeper into the lead's obsession.  In the film's first half, it's the hazy trip hop soundtrack and symbolically heavy imagery keep us guessing. When the hidden truth behind what is going on is revealed with about 45 minutes of running time left, the film, like Vertigo, changes into a study of its lead character's twisted psyche.
Amenabar does some exciting things here. The film's plot, without spoiling anything, follows Cesar, the film's lead, a womanizer that is currently involved with two women. Soon after spending the night and falling in love with one of them, his reality begins to become confused.  During the film's first half, Cesar is our guide into his Lynchian dream world. The audience's confusions are shared and amplified by the protagonist. We feel our vision of reality sliding away with Cesar's. We go insane with him. When the film morphs however (in a scene where Cesar's friend tells him he's coming undone), and Amenabar all but reveals the reason behind the madness, our sympathies shift. We stay a step ahead of Cesar, allowing us to not only observe his psyche, but watch as Amenabar lectures us about the fragile level of reality that exists in any film. The way that he keeps us questioning what is real (even though we know nothing that we see in the film is real) is brilliant. At the end, we can not even be sure that the film's final fade-out returns us to reality.
The film lacks the effortlessness that Vertigo has though. It does rely on a bit of narrative hokum in order to tie these two disparate halves of film together. Eduardo Noriega's Cesar doesn't quite manage to create the tragic humanity that Jimmy Stewart does in Vertigo, either. Nonetheless, it is far more ambitious and timely a remake of that film than something like De Palma's Obsession. In some ways, it goes farther into the realm of sexual obsession than Vertigo did, or could dream of doing. What is certain is that Amenabar, at 25, has created a film that deserves comparison to Hitchcock's best work.",1005350400,,2333,4.758024691358025
1235252,5,B00000JMOI,"If you like films that keep you guessing until the end, you'll LOVE this Spanish film. The editorial review gives as much a synopsis of the plot as possible, to give you more of the story would be unfair. It is only after the last 5 minutes of the film that you realize exactly what's going on - but the ride there will keep you enthralled. It is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen, taking you deep into the twisted ""reality"" of a disfigured man (Eduardo Nuriega), haunted by his love for the beautiful Sofia (Penelope Cruz at her finest!) But if you think this is a film that just depicts a man dealing with disfigurement, you've only touched the surface.
I found myself thinking about this film days after watching it the first time, and now after having seen it at least 5 times it still invokes questions inside of me on some of the deeper aspects of life. ""What is successs, beauty, love and happiness?"", ""Who would we be and what would we do if everything was taken away from us?"". In the end, I analogize this movie to a lesson on reincarnation. Think of that during the last 60 seconds of the film...as you find yourself covered in goosebumps.
Buy this film, because you'll want to watch it at least twice.

-the story. ...CSAR (portrayed by spanish actor eduardo noriega who is btw also in amenabar's ""TESIS"".) , is in a mental institution,where a psychiatrist (chete lera) attempts to convince him to reveal the face he hides behind a plastic mask. Cesar insists that he's horribly disfigured (do to a car accident).no matter how many times he's assured that his face has been restored through plastic surgery.
What happens next is totaly unbelievable!... the film just gets stranger and weirder till the final unpredictable conclusion. i won't spoil the rest.
the film also stars penelope cruz as cesar's fiance , najwa nimri (also played in ""los amantes del circulo polar"" aka ""lovers of the artic circle"") as nuria,who is responsible for cesar's accident,& Fele martinez(also played in amenabar's""Tesis"" , ""lovers of the artic circle"" & ""el arte de morir"") as Pelayo,cesar's best friend.
other suggestions: read philip k. dick's ""UBIK"" , order alejandro's previous film ""TESIS"" or ""thesis"" (one of aljandro's best films!) ,also, his american debut film ""THE OTHERS"" , jaume balaguero's film ""LOS SIN NOMBRE"" (the nameless).

1235254,5,B00000JMOI,"I first experienced the work of Spanish writer/director Alejandro Amenabar when i saw ""Open Your Eyes"" (""Abre los Ojos""), and let me tell you, I have yet to shut them.  Since my first encounter, I have gone on to see ""Thesis"" (his first film) and ""The Others"" (his first English film) and have fallen in love with both.  But I'm not here to write about those.  I'm here to write about ""Open Your Eyes,"" and what a film to write about.
If you have not yet seen ""Open Your Eyes"", let it be known that I am envious of you.  You are in for a wonderful surprise.  You are in the hands of a master filmmaker.  Alejandro Amenabar has a sense of storytelling with his camera that very few filmmakers today have.  His visuals are breathtaking (and I'm not just talking about Penelope Cruz) and stylized in the right kind of way.  They don't show off, they help tell the story as effactively as possible.  And boy, what a story.  This movie will take you up, down, and around without you ever wanting to get off.  Amenabar's script is loaded with so many twists and turns that summarizing the movie's plot hardly does it justice.  But I'll give you a glimpse anyways:  Eduardo Noriega, plays Cesar, a young handsome guy, that has all the luck with the girls.  Unfortunately, just as he falls for the girl of his dreams, Sofia (Penelope Cruz (could she be any more beautiful?)), his crazy ex-girlfriend, Nuria, causes a car crash that kills her and disfigures, the once perfect looking Cesar.  He awakens in a hospital bed, with his life and looks changed completely.  It starts a whirlwind of dark moments and emotions for Cesar.  Sofia can't look him in the face anymore.  What was once most important to him is gone.  He's suddenly charged with murder and his confused memory can't figure it all out..  His face is then fixed in an operation.  Wait.  His face is not fixed in an operation?  A prosthetic mask?  Sofia loves him again.  Or is it Nuria?  What's real?  What's a dream?  WHAT?
Confused?  Well, then unconfuse yourself.  Watch it.  Experience it.  I GUARENTEE you will NOT be let down.
Rarely is a film such a rollercoaster, and rarely is a rollercoaster so rewarding.  And on this rollercoaster, I'm certain you'll want to get back in line and ride it again.
****FUN-FACT--This film is currently being remade by Cameron Crowe (one of America's top writer/directors), in his follow up to ""Almost Famous"".  Crowe is calling it a ""cover"" instead of a ""remake.""  As in when a band covers one of their favorite songs from another band, Crowe his covering one of his favorite movies from another director.  The cast will include such no-names as Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, and Kurt Russell.  Retitled ""Vanilla Sky"", it is a fact that by the end of December everybody you know will have seen this this.  Get a jump start on them.  It will be BIG.  It will be GREAT.  But nothing beats an original.  Especially an original like this.

If you like psycological thrillers, unexpected endings, fantastic storytelling and best kind of suspense, this is your movie.
Just to tell you a few of it, it's about a guy, a handsome guy who had an accident and gets his face disfigured.  Then he gets depressed as the girl he loved refuses keep on going out whith him just because he has become a monster, and to make things get worse she starts a relation with his best friend.  Suddenly depression turns into anger and so the movie goes... but well, I swear the end is totally unexpected!! This dvd really worths the money!

Under it are scars so grotesque that no amount of bravery, courage or the stuff they write novels about will keep your suicidal impulses away.

Confession No. 1: you, Cesar, were a rich bachelor living the highlife in Madrid. Never see a woman more than once, that would ruin the playboy reputation. Your friend, skinny, and less successful then you are complements you; ""you have recipe for Coca Cola,"" he jokes. And you do. The next day, at your modern, luxury flat, that friend brings Sophia along, and you get that ""stupid feeling"", love. You, cruelly but inevitably steal her from you friend. She is an actress. ""Aren't you ashamed"", you ask her, ""being an actress. A fake?"" The next morning you see an incensed woman from your past. She offers you a ride. You accept. Crash and burn. The left side of your face is open flesh, the right is a rumpled mass of matter. You are a beast. You dream of Sophia, in the park, with your face intact. You see Sophia in the park. She can't get herself to look at you. It is raining. The pain is unbearable. ""I dreamt of this"", you tell her, ""but in my dream something was different. It wasn't raining.""
Confession No. 2: Money cannot work miracles. Doctors can't either. But doctors with money can. There is a light at the end of your nightmare, a surgery. Life can be bearable. Your friend has accepted Sophia and you. The friendship you share is more important than any woman. The accident is behind you. You go home to your dream girl, and you are back in your own private nightmare.
Confused? You are in Alejandro Amenbar's 1997 thriller/drama, which some misguided critics seem to think it is a science-fiction film. It may well be. A more appropriate interpretation would be a portrait of crippling insanity. The distinction is never made. It's three story lines first run parallel, then intersect. The result is one of the most disorienting films ever made. I remember seeing it a month ago and being arrested by its demanding plot and haunting imagery. I saw it again tonight, and discovered something more. The reviews have been mostly respectable of it twisty psychedelic boldness, its cleverness. And here is one of the most glaring fallacies of film criticism: critics, for the most part, only see a film once. ""Open Your Eyes"" is not merely a clever film, it is a great one.
When a man's leg is amputated, he is said to feel pain in that leg. The leg no longer exists, but the nerves connecting it to the brain still do. They are irradiated. And they tell the patient that his leg is hurting him. In medicine, they call this a ""phantom limb"". Miscellaneous sweets have cured headaches. Crooks the world over use the power of ""the Lord"" to cure illnesses. In medicine, this is called the ""Placebo effect"". If you think its real then it is. Our minds are slaves to our perceptions. Amenbar exploits that imprisonment. In ""Open Your Eyes"", the protagonist's dreams and/or nightmares AND reality are slaves to his memory. In one version of his confession he wears his fearsome prosthetic mask on the back of his head, a frightening two faced beast, standing, in the middle of the night waiting for the woman he reveres. She, in another confession, which in turn could be a nightmare or fact, was his murderer AND his victim. ""Aren't you ashamed?"" the question I quoted before, ""being an actress. A fake"". It is only then that you understand the origin of that image, the two faced beast.
And so, with eagerly anticipated repeated viewings, the picture becomes clearer, fuller, deeper. The film is like a puzzle, once solved; it gives the viewer a profound exhilaration. There is also a more visceral pleasure to be had; the film starts and ends with its protagonist (and by extension you the audience) in the dark. ""Open Your Eyes,"" the voices whisper. And you pray, to God, the doctors, your sub-conscience or whoever controls what the world will be like when you wake, that it does not make long for the darkness again.",986083200,3,4503,4.686868686868687

1235281,5,B00000JMOI,"Reminiscent of Franjes' french classic 'Les Yeux Sans Visage' ('Eyes Without A Face') in its exploration of the relationship between our sense of identity and physical appearance, 'Open Your Eyes' also blends elements of 'Cyrano De Bergerac', 'Vertigo' and 'The Matrix'. And it works. I went to see this film not entirely certain of what to expect and found myself thoroughly gripped for its entire duration. The labyrinth plot of 'Open Your Eyes' begins as a love story, takes an unexpected turn into the medical horror genre and twists into thriller territory before branching off into science fiction. Without giving too much away (the surpise element is part of the delight of this movie), the film begins as a love story between Sofia (Penelope Cruz) and spoiled, womanising playboy Cesar (Eduardo Noriega in a gripping performance). When Cesar's face is irreperably disfigured in a horrific car accident involving a spurned ex-lover, he finds that he in turn is rejected by Sofia. This thumbnail sketch of the plot does no justice to a film that will take you may places both emotionally and psychologically, and none of them predictable.
'Open your Eyes' deals with themes of love and loss; of our perception of 'reality'; of identity and the metaphorical 'masks' we wear in daily life and of others ability (or lack of) to see through them (Sofia is an mime artist and is first shown with a painted face). The film also explores the randomness of existence and the way in which our actions towards others may have devastating and far flung consequences.
'Open Your Eyes' is currently being re-made as 'Vanilla Sky' starring Tom Cruise, with Penelope Cruz reprising her former role. Perhaps the change in title has something to do with its similarity to Cruise's previous film 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Although the Hollywood version will be interesting to watch, I would strongly urge anyone to see the original, as I doubt it can be improved upon.",983318400,,1948,4.960244648318043

I am curious about - but not quite anticipating - the Cameron Crowe remake starring Tom Cruise in the Eduardo Noriega role, Cameron Diaz as the ""femme fatale,"" and Penelope Cruz reprising her role.
