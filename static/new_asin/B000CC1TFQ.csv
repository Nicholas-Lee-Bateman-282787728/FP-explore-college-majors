8096761,5,B000CC1TFQ,"I clearly recall seeing an episode of Beautiful Homes and Great Estates about four years ago and was instantly left with a longing for more of this fantastic series. I kept up with thier broadcasts for several months, but then the Basketball season began and its time slot was changed to a later time. The station that airs this show also broadcasts the Basketball games. Eventually, I completely lost touch with the show, sadly.
 However, that is all water under the bridge, now that I've discovered these wonderful first-season episodes on DVD! I must say, I was rather surprised to find that these were being sold through the DVD format. I mean, this isn't the type of series that attracts millions of viewers from all over the country, you see.
 All the more reason why this boxed set is such an unbelievable find! This is such a high-quality program well worth enjoying for both pleasure and more business oriented interests. No matter who you are, you're sure to enjoy these. As a matter of fact, I've even begun to take notes on the specific details I would love to have comprised in my future home.",1202601600,2,1106,4.666666666666667

8096763,5,B000CC1TFQ,This is an impressive collection of many homes and estates that are a pleasure to watch.  There are many different ideas that can inspire a person when working on their own new house and the landscaping is equally stunning.  My sister in law took the first copy I bought since she is planning to build a new home and I simply had to order another for myself.  I already watched it once and I am planning of going through with it again and showing it to my architectural designer when the time comes :) These are high quality and pretty expensive homes.,1162684800,5,552,4.392156862745098
