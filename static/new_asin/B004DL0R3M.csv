Direct teaching of social skills
Social Stories
Sensory integration
Applied Behvior analysis
holding high expectations
viewing your child as a child who also has autism rather than an autistic child.
viewing behavior as a symptom of sensory or communication problems which can be addressed, rather than willful naughtiness.
Differentiating between when a child is simly being noncompliant (won't) and not understanding (can't).",1373846400,,664,5.394230769230769
8425555,5,B004DL0R3M,My son was diagnosed with autism 11 years ago.  I only wish this film was out there for parents to seen back then. This film gives hope to parents looking for therapies to help newly diagnosed children. Parents of children with autism quickly realize that one therapy does not fit all -- that is the beauty of this film. It shows many levels of autism and many options for reaching your child.  Brian and Triple Knot Productions have kindly offered another avenue of hope to persons with autism and their parents and/or caregivers.,1290816000,,531,4.698924731182796
