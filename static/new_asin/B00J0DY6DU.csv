8647097,5,B00J0DY6DU,"The four episodes on Volumes 4 and 5 are all from the same week, Tuesday through Friday in order.

From Volume 5:

Show #1 -- The ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" show is a classic and shows Johnny at his most willing to make a fool of himself (and enjoy it as much as the audience did).  That show also includes Robert Blake, Don Rickles, Bob Hope and Desi Arnaz.  I especially enjoyed Desi's appearance and Johnny's interview with him, as you so seldom saw Desi in that type of setting.

Show #2 -- Of all four shows in that week, this one took the cake for old-fashioned, classic entertainment.  It was Bing Crosby's first appearance on ""The Tonight Show"".  He and Ray Bolger shared some great stories about vaudeville and the early theater circuit.  Bolger at 72 doing not only a soft-shoe, but als a pretty mean bit of tap dancing.  Marvin Hamlisch playing piano in a position you can't imagine.  Then Bolger, Crosby and Hamlisch performing together (they were plugging an upcoming TV music special).  But watch for 92-year-old Burt Mustin to bring the house down with the biggest laugh of the night -- he actually rocked Johnny back in his chair.

I truly recommend getting both Volumes 4 and 5 together.",1399161600,,1197,4.62085308056872
8647098,5,B00J0DY6DU,"Wow! What a great couple of shows! They are complete (each runs about and hour and sixteen min. with commercials) and have the original music. But, what a treat to see Ray Bolger and Bing Crosby perform together, the whole episode seemed so natural. Keep these volumes coming...bring on the Red Skelton, Dean Martin, Jack Benny, and Jackie Gleason episodes!",1395878400,5,357,4.966666666666667
