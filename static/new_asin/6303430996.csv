7846921,2,6303430996,"The Paul Dini-produced Batman series perhaps does more to humanize the character than other television and screen versions have to date. One important element, Batman's relationship with Harvey Dent/Two-Face, plays an important role in these stories. As Bruce Wayne's friend, Harvey Dent has always played an important role in BW/Batman's life. Yet Batman can only seek treatment for his emotionally disturbed friend; Dent/Two-Face keeps Batman's distinction between justice and punishment clearly defined. Batman is a better hero because he learns through attempting to help Harvey Dent and preventing Two-Face's criminality that justice cannot always rely on permanent fixes; it, like freedom, requires constant vigilence.
Just a quick note here (I've added this note to every tape in this series I have reviewed)--while I think the Dini-produced animated Batman has been one of the hallmarks of 90s animation, I do not advise buying the tapes in this series because they are not recorded in SP mode. You will get fuzzy pictures and sound. It is a shame that these excellent programs do not get the packaging they deserve.",994723200,2,1124,5.3559322033898304
7846922,5,6303430996,"This is a great Batman video to add to your collection! It contains the two-part storyline ""Shadow of the Bat,"" which features Two-Face as the central villain in a plot to destroy Commissioner Gordon. The true story revolves around Barbara Gordon's attempt to save her father, which results in her transformation into BATGIRL. This video shows Batgirl as a novice superhero with Batman and Robin trying to make heads or tails of Batgirl's existence. It's a fun, humorous, and intriguing new take on the origin, and ultimate acceptance, of Batgirl. Highly recommended!!!",986688000,3,569,5.195652173913044
7846923,4,6303430996,"Though the two-parter on this tape, 'Shadow of the Bat' is a fantastic story, it would have been better released as the Batgirl video. The episodes do not explain Two-Face's origins but show how and why the Batgirl came about. Watch it. Decide for yourself.",969926400,4,257,4.733333333333333
