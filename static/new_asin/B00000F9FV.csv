7908667,5,B00000F9FV,"I did not see ""The Fifth Seal"" on DVD; I saw it in a movie theater as a student.
I am very  critical about movies I see; I rarely see a movie that I could call amazing.
I saw this movie with my friends and for a long time after leaving the movie theater we were all silent, trying to digest what we saw and catching our breath. The movie makes you ask yourself difficult questions and think about life and its values in a way we rarely think. It's beautifully done and acted - at no time do you feel anything artificial: this is a piece of life and a deep philosophical fable at the same time.
I was so impressed by the movie that I found a translation of Santa's book and read it. I was amazed at how the movie managed not to spoil this wonderful book, but to express all the most important emotions and ideas in such a beautiful and caring way.
If you like superb movies and breath-taking acting, see ""The Fifth Seal"". This impression and this memory last a lifetime, unlike most of one-day sensations we waste our time and money on.",1295568000,3,1035,4.201005025125628
7908668,3,B00000F9FV,"Aftering watching Zoltan's Fabri's ""The Fifth Seal (az otodik pecset)"" I came away asking myself some serious questions about cinema. What makes a great film? Can a film shows us a time in history when unspeakable events happened and still be considered a ""great"" film? Is there such thing as a movie being too truthful? Can films cross a line of reality and be seen as too realistic?

 ""The Fifth Seal"" is a Hungarian film made in 1976 by Zoltan Fabri. It was based on a novel written by Ferenc Santa with a screenplay by Fabri. It takes place shortly after WW2. Hungary is still being occupied by outside forces, as it would remain so until 1989, after the fall of the Berlin wall.

 A group of friends sit and talk, engaging in everyday subjects. But one of them tells a serious story. Pretend you are about to die but you will be reincarnated into one of two people; a slave or a slave-owner. The slave suffered harshly under the slave-owner. He had his tongue cut off, had his wife and child killed and one of his eyes removed. But, he still goes on living because he tells himself, he is a good person, because at least he had never committed such terrible, violent acts. On the other hand the slave-owner goes through no moral crissis. He doesn't see his actions as being wrong. So the men are left with the choice of whether to be poor and noble or wealthy and corrupt.

 Some people may feel the choice is easy, one way or another. But the men struggle to find an answer. No one answers the question that night but each man thinks about it on his way home. The fact that the slave-owner feels no remorse for his actions makes the choice difficulty. If we have no moral code, we are then capable of anything. We decided what is right and wrong.

 But as the films progresses the men will find themself in a situation very similar and will have to make touch choices or suffer terrible consequences. They are arrested for no reason. The Nazis have made up charges against them and have beated them. They are told they can leave only if they each agree to committ a senseless and violent act against one of their own. Now the question is should they be noble or free. They will suffer no remorse if they tell themselves they simply HAD to do it.

 The friends are played by Lajos Oze, Laszlo Markus, Ference Bencze, and Sandor Horvath. The director, Zoltan Fabri, is not very well known to audiences outside of Hungary. Almost none of his films are availble in this country. But he has gained internation fame and great respect. One of his first successful world-wide hits was ""The Merry-Go-Round"" released in 1956. He also made another film based on one of Santa's novels, ""Husz Ora (Twenty Hours)"".

 And now we find ourselves right back where we started. Can a film be too realistic? ""The Fifth Seal"" is well-made. Finely acted, directed strongly by Fabri, good cinematography and a fitting musical score which has an almost circus quality to it. But, would I go as far as to call it a good movie? It's not something I ever want to see again. I was really distribured by the film. It hits a little too close to home for me as I am Hungarian. To think that such acts were committed against people bothers me. My family lived through this. They suffered at the hands of the fascist and the communist. ""The Fifth Seal"" is too personal for me. Should others watch it? I suppose so. I guess it is a film that needs to be seen so others can see what was going on in other parts of the world. And many others may not have the emotional baggage which I carry with me. Again, this is not to say the film is poorly made, but, why should I whole hearted recommend something that makes me feel so bad inside?

 Bottom-line: A film a little too personal for me giving the fact that I am Hungarian. Still I suppose others can say this is a strong a bold film which attacks the fascist and communist alike. These were dangerous times to live in and the film presents that idea.",1190332800,4,3971,4.407103825136612
