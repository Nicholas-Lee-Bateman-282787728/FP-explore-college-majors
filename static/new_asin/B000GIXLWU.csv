2614353,4,B000GIXLWU,"The Sharpe miniseries was exceptionally well done and takes place during the peninsular campaign of the Napoleonic War. It also stayed fairly close to the book except in one major way. In the books, Sharpe is given his commission by a gratefull Wellington in India, before the bulk of the series. The miniseries moved that event to Iberia for very good production reasons. In doing so, however, they seemingly left out some very good Sharpe stories. This program goes a long way in remedying that.

It takes place after Waterloo. Sharpe is called back by Wellington to go to India and solve a problem with a renegade India Company officer. Sharpe is not interested until he learns that his friend, SGM Harper is missing in India.

Upon arriving there, he finds some of the independent princedoms in revolt against the British. One in particular, it being directed by a courtesan of the previous Rajah acting as regent for the young prince. Her trusted advisor is the renegade officer. Sharpe will have to get into the enemy capital, win the trust of the powers that be, rescue his friend and keep the Brits from being slaughtered. It's all in a day's work.

The story line here combines three from the books. SHARPE's TIGER, SHARPE'S FORTRESS and SHARPE's are conflated into a single story line. The production takes a sympathetic view towards Indian independence and but comes across well in spite of the overtones. The rebellious Indians in this production are portrayed as Hindus as opposed to Muslims as in the books and the historical record but that should do nothing to detract from the fun of seeing Sharpe in action again.",1162166400,2,1631,4.817857142857143
2614354,5,B000GIXLWU,"Yes, the timeline is all wrong.  Yes, Sharpe's age had to be tweaked.  However given that we're sitting on the 'right' side of a new Sharpe episode, given that no one was foolish enough to replace Sean Bean with a younger model, as far as I'm concerned all is right with the world.

A grouping of Cornwall's books (Sharpe's Tiger, Triumph and Fortress, all great reads too!)all set in India encompass 'Challenge'; they certainly do embrace all the elements essential to quintessential, classic Sharpe.  'Challenge' has, death, duplicity, resourcefulness, pluck, love, blood and battle.

Cornwall's Sharpe is inspired and Bean's interpretation of him is well...spot on.  He owns it.  Beyond how much respect I have for Bean as an actor (Extremely Dangerous, Essex Boys, The Dark) the man is exceedingly easy on the eyes!

Add to that the pleasure of the effortless collaboration between Darragh O'Malley (Harper) and Bean and their relaxed bickering and you've an amazing DVD.  The bonus features are terrific and packed.

This is a favorite.  This is fun.  This is so worth owning!",1161302400,4,1081,5.045197740112994
2614355,4,B000GIXLWU,"I wish some consumer reviews would quit harping and nitpicking how this episode does not exactly follow the plot of the book. This film is a compilation of three of Bernard Cramwell's novels. In the time frame of three hours it is impossible to include every one of his plot twists and turns. It is a given that some details will be deleted, and for the purpose of adapting the book to film medium some new plot conventions would be added. Rarely does a film identically match a novel and transferring a book to film creates the necessity for some artistic license.

  The ""Sharpe"" series should be accepted as pure entertainment, not a detailed history lesson, so just accept the plot with some suspension of belief and not quibble about strict historical interpretation. ""Sharpe's Challenge"" is very loosely based on events which happened in India during British Colonialism and all the characters are fictitious. If the viewer accepts this, you'll definitely enjoy this swashbuckling episode. Lots of heroic deeds of derring do, acts of transformation, romance, political intrigue...there is plenty of swordfighting and minimal amounts of gore, blood and guts. The violence is not gratuitious, which suits me just fine, because I don't like violent action pictures.  The movie is character driven, plot driven, with a strong narrative and literary script. This film is a work of art.

  Nine years has passed since Sean Bean starred in ""Sharpe's Waterloo"" and, of course, he is older than prior episodes. Some consumer critics were irritated that Sean Bean doesn't have the teenage looks which the original novel places him in India.  Again, they need to ""get over it"". Sean Bean was 47 when this film was made, and still has plenty of rugged sex appeal. I respect him, because he is one of the few actors in Hollywood that hasn't been pumped full of Botox, nothing has been nipped, tucked, lifted. It's a pleasant experience to see a handsome middle aged actor with absolutely NO plastic surgery! Clearly, this is an actor comfortable underneath his own skin.

  Sean Bean is a world class actor, classically trained at the British Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and he always gives a masterful performance in all episodes of the 15 ""Richard Sharpe"" series - he ""owns"" the role and I can't envision any other actor giving the same credibility to the character. When the first ""Sharpe"" series was shot in the

mid-1990's, Paul McGann was initially cast in the role, but bowed out at the last minute due to an injury. Sean Bean was awarded the role as an incredible fluke of good luck and frankly, I couldn't be more delighted! This was the role that made him a star - and the ""Sharpe"" series is a classic that holds up over time.

  The production values, cinematography, art direction are very strong, and the period costumes are gorgeous. A very fine ensemble cast of character actors all give wonderful performances. Toby Stephens as the turncoat rogue British officer who switches sides is deliciously evil as ""the man you love to hate"". Darragh O'Malley as Sgt. Harper gives another wry, sardonic performance as Sharpe's trusted ally.  As ever, Sean Bean is terrific and I loved his performance.

  The only real problem I have with this episode are a few TERRIBLE actors. Padma Lakshmi who plays the conniving, sinister courtesan turned Regent ruler is quite beautiful, but frankly cannot act her way out of a paper bag and gives a dishwater-limp performance. This could have been a very juicy role for a skilled actress but she was horridly miscast.

Her bio states she was a model, celebrity chef and the wife of Salaman Rushdie. She was miscast, and I think she got this part based on her social connections. It is my understanding this was Padma Lakshmi's very FIRST acting role, and well, it shows with a wooden performance. She is an absolute knock-out in the looks dept. - so I just ignored her weak performance, since it was just a supporting role.

  The actor who plays Sgt. Bickerstaff is horrible and very hammy.  He screams all his lines in full blown manic rage. One very glaring plot hole that was inconsistent is although Sharpe has resigned his military commission and was in retirement, he still had the rank of Colonel while on special assigment in India - so why on earth does he allow Sgt. Bickerstaff to beat him up and threaten his life?  It was considered an offense punishible by death to strike a superior officer - so when Sgt. Bickerstaff attacks Richard Sharpe - it doesn't make sense he gets off without being put to death.......but in the ""Sharpe"" series, its a given  there always has to be a nasty villian to create the narrative development - Sharpe needs an adversary to overcome in his inevitable victory.

  I've seen all the previous 14 ""Sharpe"" episodes and by far, this 15th

episode has the biggest budget, largest cast and most sumptuous production values. In the 14th episode ""Sharpe's Waterloo"" all of Richard Sharpe's cohorts from the Chosen Men are killed off in battle.

I missed all those wonderful character actors who were in most of the prior episodes and played the Chosen Men - however, Wellington and Ramona from the original cast have small cameos, and the brand new characters introduced help round out the cast. Lucy Brown is wonderful as the General's daughter. It is a smaller, supporting role - but she is very good at it. The General's daughter doesn't really fall into the category of a ""love interest"" for Richard Sharpe, but more along the lines of an unrequieted crush that never is allowed to surface - so I enjoyed the bittersweet ending when Sharpe goes off to France at the end. She and Sharpe bond emotionally, but must hold themselves back because both their lives are in danger and the primary goal is to escape from the Maharaja's fort alive, and in one piece.

  The Indian actors who portray the Maharahah Kandhe Rao and his sister give very strong performances. I appreciated the screenwriter emphasizing the oppressive effect of British Colonial imperialism on the people of India. Instead of the stereotypical cliche of ""backwards natives"" roles the Indian actors are given a literate script and strong dialogue when they explain to British officers they are justified in wanting the British to leave their country and deserve to manage their own affairs.

At first, the British General's daughter and the Indian princess have a combative relationship - but eventually come to respect each other and form an alliance based on their mutual survival. These two women in the film aren't just ""window dressing"" and maidens in distress - but two women who manage to deal with the political/military machinations they find themselves embroiled in.

  This a terrific movie and I know you'll love it! I highly recommend all the other 14 episodes of the Richard Sharpe series. I definitely recommend watching them IN ORDER of sequence - #1 to #14 - there was one ""clunker"" episode about lost Aztec gold, but on the whole, this series is world class and rollicking fun, a romantic, epic swashbuckler set during the Napoleonic wars in Spain and France.",1159142400,34,7129,4.846661170651278
2614356,4,B000GIXLWU,"What we have here is a greatly condensed version of the original India novels in the Sharpe series.  Several factors must have contributed to making this production this way.  For one, Sean Bean for all his hardy good looks can't be made into a teen-age Sharpe.  This would be required in order to portray the earlier novels in true form.  Second, a larger production qaulity would be required to portray the battle of Assaye (1803)in anything like the manner it requires.  So the production opted for a hybrid version with some vague references to his earlier career.

All in all they tie in all the loose ends pretty well, and manage to combine three complex novels into one storyline.  They also add a lot along the way!  Does it work?  Well, yes and no.  The exotic locale for India certainly enhances the production value.  Also, setting the story post 1815 works in a way as the British were involved in several minor conflicts then.  In particular the campaign against Nepal comes to mind in 1818 which would bring about the incorporation of Gurkha mercinaries into the British army.  After that we come down to your standard Sharpe action bit.

I have come to the conclusion with watching the TV versions of these novels to just enjoy them for their entertainment value.  To try and compare them with the novels seems fruitless and frustrating.  Sean Bean continues to carry a good Sharpe character, the production value is not bad, there are some good action sequences.  So if you enjoy this kind of fare then this rates as a good production.  The Sharpe novels and history this is not!  But its fun to see the period portrayed anyway.",1158105600,2,1644,4.685314685314685
2614357,4,B000GIXLWU,"In response the comment made by 'Reader' below that ""The fact of the matter is, this is not a historical novel - it's a fantasy concocted about events that didn't happen, during a time when such events were not happening, solely to capitalize on the popularity of Sharpe and Harper. It comes across as the mish-mash it is.""  It is a mish mash of the first Sharpe novels but it is unfair to say that such events were not happening.  This story takes place at the time of the third Mahratta war and there is plenty of action between the British and the Pindari bandits and local rulers.  A quick Google search will show that there was a lot going on in India two years after Waterloo.

I personally thoroughly enjoyed Challenge for what it is and hope there will be more.  It is quite unique on tv and something to be cherished.",1157846400,7,826,4.372549019607843
2614358,4,B000GIXLWU,"I'm a huge fan of Bernard Cornwell, especially the Sharpe series. Sharpe's Fortress about the Siege of Gawilghur is perhaps my favorite Sharpe book. I like the Sean Bean TV movies, but as usual the books are better.

Sharpe's Challenge, two 90-minute movies being shown on BBC America, is loosely based on Sharpe's Fortress. William Dodd is the evil traitor now serving the Maharaja, there is a Hakeswill-like character (Sgt Shadrach Bickerstaff), a fortress is besieged, and beautiful women abound. Sharpe actually turns down the rather unsubtle advances of the scheming and beautiful Madhuvanthi (Padma Lakshmi) and I don't recall Sharpe doing that too often! The events take place some 14 years after Sharpe was last in India in the books and Sharpe is a colonel now.

So, it's a Sharpe story with reasonable verisimiltude for historical details of the era and the setting, but Sharpe's Challenge is not based on an actual specific battle (like the Siege of Gawilghur). It's an entertaining story and quite enjoyable way to pass three hours if you can set aside your quibbles.",1157673600,30,1079,5.022346368715084
2614359,2,B000GIXLWU,"Before everyone gets all fired up, let me state for the record that I love the Sharpe novels and have always considered Sean Bean perfectly suited to the character on the screen. However, Cornwell and Bean should have passed on this concept. When Cornwell wrote most of the Sharpe series, one must assume he did not consider them as screen plays. During the original series made over 10 years ago, various adaptations were made to the story lines. It didn't necessarily make them any better adaptations to the screen than the original story would have been. In fact, on at least one occasion it made them downright silly (the Aztec gold episode, for example). However, at the time at least Bean could credibly play the character's age, and the story at least took place in Spain and Portugal during the Napoleonic Wars.

In the India volumes of the Sharpe series of novels, Sharpe is still in his teens, an enlisted man until he saves Wellington. However, Bean was too old to play a teenager, and the same problems would have applied with all of the other characters who appeared in those books. As a result, a historical anamoly had to be concocted so that everyone could go to India at a time when no such significant events were actually happening. Sharpe doesn't save Wellington. He doesn't have conflict with Hawkswill. Harper and Simmerson are there (they shouldn't be). The fact of the matter is, this is not a historical novel - it's a fantasy concocted about events that didn't happen, during a time when such events were not happening, solely to capitalize on the popularity of Sharpe and Harper. It comes across as the mish-mash it is. As someone who is quite fond of the series, even the earlier films, this movie was painful to watch. If they wanted to do a film about these characters, they should have done Sharpe's Devil, or even one of the later books involving the Napoleonic Wars - at least you could slap a toupee on Harper and pretend the actors are close to the age of the characters on the screen.

I give this two stars rather than one, because those who have never seen the prior series and are unconcerned with any historical relevance may be able to suspend belief for entertainment value. The acting and sets aren't bad - I just can't forget watching this how the money would have been better spent making a movie which is actually  based on the books. They were good books and would have made a good film.",1157587200,12,2434,4.61662817551963
2614360,5,B000GIXLWU,"If you're a Sharpe fan, you won't be disappointed with this newest installment of the television interpretations of Bernard Cornwell's novels.  Yes, you're right, this one is a mishmash of the three books (Sharpe's Tiger, Triumph and Fortress) set in India, and Sharpe's age had to be fiddled with to accomodate the always gorgeous Sean Bean, but who really cares?  In Challenge, Sharpe is no longer the young Sergeant with the bad attitude and short temper from the books, he is the older, retired officer with the bad attitude and short temper that we learned to love in the 90's on the telly.  Same deal, right?  We aren't arguing with anything that brings either Sharpe or Sean back to our televisions.

Challenge has the usual entertaining Sharpe storyline of beautiful heroine in distress, incompetent and untrustworthy British officers (including the always deliciously evil Simmerson, (Michael Cochrone) back for a reprise and Major Dodd, a sneering Toby Stephens at his evil best), faithful Sgt. Harper, exotic locations and lots of shooting and killing.  Plus elephants, always a great addition to any story and not used enough in this film, and a conniving evil Indian Queen.  Short cameos by Wellington and Ramona (Harper's wife) are a nice touch.

Assaults (military and romantic), mystery, treachery, bravery and, as always, instructions on how to load and fire three rounds in a minute.  Great fun all around.

Okay, maybe Sean has aged a little, but he still fills out the green jacket (and pants) JUST FINE.  And, of course, any gratitutous shirtless scenes only add to the enjoyment!

Sharpe's Challenge is just as much fun as any of the others in the series, better than some, definitely had more money to spend.  Grab your rifle and fall in!",1154390400,131,1761,4.969283276450512

2614403,4,B000GIXLWU,"We last saw Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean) in the thick of the fighting at the Battle of Waterloo (1815). After Waterloo, Colonel Sharpe resigned his commission and returned with his lovely French wife Lucille to her farm in Normandy. Two years have passed, Lucille has died from a fever, and widower Sharpe receives an order to report to the Duke of Wellington at British army headquarters in London (usually referred to correctly in the Sharpe stories as ""Horse Guards""). Wellington wants Sharpe to return to India as his agent to investigate a potentially dangerous uprising against British East India Company rule by one of the rajahs of the Maratha (pronounced Maratta) Confederacy Khande Rao (Karan Panthaky) who is known to be building a large army and using it to raid outposts of the British East India Company (hereinafter referred to as ""the Company"" for brevity). Sharpe is initially unwilling to return to India until he learns that Wellington had sent Sharpe's old comrade-in-arms Sergeant Major Patrick Harper (Daragh O'Malley) to India to investigate the rebellion and that Harper has been missing for six months.

Sharpe arrives in India wearing the green uniform of the 95th Rifles and with the title Colonel Sharp but lacking a commission in either the British Army or the Company's army. He is required to report to General Burroughs, commander of the Company's 3rd Army, but first meets the general's stunning daughter Celia who is travelling to join her father but has been delayed on a dirt road by a mishap to one of the wagons of her military escort which comprises about twenty Company native foot soldiers (Sepoys) and a troop of about twenty native cavalry under the command of Englishman Captain Lawrence. Sharpe warns Captain Lawrence that this area is dangerously close to the fortress of Ferragher from which the rebel Rajah Khande Rao deploys his marauders. When told that the escort party are awaiting the return of their native cavalry who have gone off to forage, Sharpe offers to look for them. He finds the native cavalry in a village whose inhabitants have been slaughtered by Khande Rao's marauders. They are attacked when the marauders return, and are hard pressed until assisted by a heavily disguised man who turns out to be Sergeant Major Harper wielding his lethal seven-barrel rifle. Sharpe and Harper return with the native cavalry to the place where Sharpe left Celia Burroughs and find that all foot soldiers of her escort have been killed and that she and Captain Lawrence have been taken captive by the rebel rajah's troops who are led by a former Company lieutenant and turncoat named William Dodd (Toby Stephens). Dodd is a vicious and ambitious psychopath who has been appointed a general to lead Khande Rao's army and will prove to be a dangerous adversary for Sharpe to overcome. Sharpe's wants to set off in pursuit with Harper but is advised by the commander of the native cavalry Captain Mohan Singh (Aly Khan) that they must report the seizure of his daughter to General Burroughs.

On arrival at the 3rd Army encampment, Sharpe learns that General Burroughs is suffering from a lengthy illness and that his Company army is now commanded by Sharpe's arch-enemy from the campaign against Napoleon in Spain, the cowardly, bullying, and incompetent General Sir Henry Simmerson (Michael Cochrane) who hates Sharpe. One of the odd aspects of this Sharpe adventure is Simmerson's apparent willingness to accept Sharpe's verbal assurance that he speaks with the authority of Horse Guards in London even though he produces no document to prove that authority, and Simmerson does not demand to see such proof of authority from a person whom he despises. A messenger arrives from Khandi Rao with the severed head of Captain Lawrence and a warning that if the British attack the fortress of Ferragher, Khandi Rao will kill General Burrough's daughter. When pressed by Sharpe, the cowardly Simmerson refuses to move the 3rd Army against Khande Rao's fortress without Company orders and reinforcements, but he agrees to let Sharpe and Harper risk their lives in an attempt to infiltrate Ferragher and rescue Celia Burroughs with the dismissive words: ""Go and die Sharpe."" Before leaving the encampment, Sharpe speaks to the fever-stricken General Burroughs who welcomes Sharpe's help in rescuing his daughter with the words: ""Bring her back for me Colonel."" While Sharpe and Harper set out on this highly dangerous mission, General Burroughs overrides Simmerson and, despite his fragile state of health, orders his troops to strike camp and  march on Ferragher.

Will Sharpe and Harper rescue the general's beautiful daughter alive and defeat the villains behind the formidable walls of the fortress of Ferragher? The military action so well loved by Sharpe fans then develops at a brisk and unrelenting pace and is matched by poisonous intrigue in Ferragher. Although I personally preferred Sharpe's adventures in the settings of the Napoleonic war, I thoroughly enjoyed this story and recommend it to all fans of Sharpe's adventures.",1326240000,,5078,5.077844311377246

2614405,4,B000GIXLWU,"This made for TV movie is full of adventure, daring escapes, mass murder/ruthless killings, exotic locals, a touch of sexiness, and the man to get us through it all- the noble, but unbreakable Colonel Sharpe aka Sean Bean.

I was ignorant of Sharpe until I ran across a copy at the library- the one that follows, Shapre's Peril- both taking place in India.  They're full of British, early 19th century, imperialistic warring and manners.  Add double cross and evil machinations with  Sharpe reluctantly thrown into the mix.  Here under the auspices of Wellington, he's off to India, and ends up trying to rescue a general's daughter(Lucy Brown) from 'heathen' natives.

The real evil force he encounters is a turncoat played with great relish by Toby Stephens.  The Indians display lots of horrific means of savagery like spiking enemies heads, but there's a certain sympathy given them due the English occupation.

Filmed partly in India, the setting is appropriately exotic; moreover, it's a fairly big budget allowing for good battle scenes, explosions galore, and I think overall well chosen actors.  Bean's terrifically handsome, rugged, worn(I'm interested to see him in ""Black Death"" , set during the bubonic plague, when released here in the US). Daragh O'Malley returns too as his faithful cohert.

It's more of a man's movie(forgive the generality).  There is a touch of romance, but not really- more like kiss'em, say bye and let them cry.  And I think it is a bit gratuitous in violence and nudity.  The nudity's short, but dramatic.  They rip the general's daughter's top off just before spiking her companion's head.  They also show her reclining in a tub, sans bath bubbles, while threatened and gawked at by above villain.  I guess it builds effect.

I liked the extras including an extended ""making of"" Sharpe's Challenge.  I find these fascinating, sometimes as much as the movie. Bernard Cornwell, the terrific novelist, also talks about his character.

Overall, the Brits tend to make great period pieces, and I'm heading, in reverse, now to Sharpe's Waterloo(2001).  He's a cool, stalwart, w/o the stiff upper lip dude.",1296518400,3,2140,5.06
2614406,5,B000GIXLWU,"This is another adaptation of Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe novels. Its a very loose interpretation of parts of three novels turned into a 180 minute film. While the original novels had a very young Sharpe fighting in India, Sean Bean's age required that the setting be changed to post-waterloo. But they managed to preserve much of the original story. Its not going to please on historical detail, but there is no way that it could. Its an understandable compromise.

The production values are very good. They seem higher than previous films in the series. A number of old familiar characters reappear and its a very good adventure story. Its not high drama, but its solid entertainment of a sort that isn't so common anymore. Sean Bean's acting and intensity, as usual, holds the film together.

The film keeps explainations to a minimum. While it can be enjoyed as a pure adventure story, understanding the historical setting requires either a reasonable knowledge of British India of the period or having read the India trilogy of sharpe novels. They don't, for example, explain the differences between the British Army, the East India Company's Army, the Indian States (and their armies) allied with the British and the Indian States fighting against the British properly.

2614414,4,B000GIXLWU,"Sharpe's Challenge Worthy Return

By Kristin Battestella

After a ten year break, the BBC returned to its Napoleonic series Sharpe in 2006 with Sharpe's Challenge. Based on the novels by Bernard Cornwell, this special two part episode is slim on premise but big on action and exotic locales.

Five years after Waterloo, Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean) is now alone on his farm in Normandy after his French lover's death. He is suddenly summoned to England by Lord Wellington (Hugh Fraser), and at first declines the chance to put down an uprising in India. Wellington's first agent in India, horse trader Patrick Harper (Daragh O'Malley), however, has gone missing. Sharpe finds Harper once he reaches India, and together they must rescue damsels in distress and overthrow corrupt Indian warlords.

Sharpe's Challenge is an awkward tale to summarize. On one hand its moving forward, taking place after Waterloo, but it is a composite of Cornwall's early Sharpe novels Tiger, Triumph, and Fortress. This mix of the two time periods automatically sets Challenge up for conflicting story points and even anger from die hard fans. If Sharpe's lover Lucille is dead, long time writer Russell Lewis and director Tom Clegg have erased two of Sharpe's children. Oops. Now that I've gone back to read Sharpe's Tiger I can see where pieces have appeared in Challenge. Its strange to read about Private Sharpe under Sergeant Hakeswill in Tiger when Challenge merely gives us a briefly red coated and pony tailed Bean. Could the powers that be have made a full length trilogy with some new young folk as Sharpe? Bean is no spring chicken, but in this day of reimagings and remakes I'm glad the production has stuck with its fans.

Challenge brings back all of our old Sharpe favorites. It's great that everyone was willing to come back and storylines were made to accommodate Wellington, the decrepit Simmerson (Michael Cochrane), even Ramona. There's a few snafus regarding characters who were killed earlier in the series that are somehow alive and well here, and Sergeant Bickerstaff is clearly a poor man's Hakeswill. Sean Bean however, is on form, and the reunion with Daragh O'Malley makes Challenge. The guest stars for Sharpe's Challenge seem more high end than the series of old. Padme Lakshmi (Now of Top Chef who I knew from her dreadful guest spot on Enterprise) is perfectly cast as the icy and exotic Madhuvanthi. I did however expect more from Toby Stephens (Robin Hood, Die Another Day) He just grimaces and pursues his lips a lot and says kinky things. I imagine some British gals find this very pretty, but we've seen better, uglier and nastier villains in Sharpe.

Challenge does give us something we haven't seen in Sharpe before: India. Despite the story's confusions, India was by far the best move for Challenge and future Sharpe productions. Some of the battles seem dusty and small scale, almost like the first film Sharpe's Rifles where the logistics were still being figured out. On the whole, however, the cultural changes, use of native scenery, historical sites, and local extras give Challenge an extra flair. I'm not sure how accurate the ladies' costumes are to the period, but they are very bright in what has been a somewhat dark and drab series. And they show some skin, always important for male viewers! At last it seems that technology has finally caught up to the fun stories and action Sharpe has told. Challenge looks so big, bright, and epic. I'm glad this episode is longer than the previous ninety minute installments. The look and excitement of Challenge tell us there's still fuel left in Sharpe's engine.

And shocker of shockers what does my Sharpe's Challenge DVD have? Extras, by golly I kid you not! Although the behind the scenes feature has a silly, aloof focus on an Indian extra's quest to meet Sean Bean, these long awaited insights into the Sharpe series are more than welcome. Fight choreography, interviews with Cornwell and the cast, humorous on set moments. Not all of it is stellar material, but after fourteen Sharpe movies with no extras, I'll take it! What else am I loving on my Sharpe's Challenge DVD? The bloopers? The photo gallery? No, the subtitles!

Sharpe's Challenge is a must for Sean Bean fans and Sharpe collectors. You're complete collection is now incomplete without it. Challenge may not be perfect, but the spirit of Sharpe is alive and well here. A new telefilm, Sharpe's Peril, is airing across the pond soon. Is Sharpe's Challenge the introductory film to a new Sharpe series? I hope so!",1229299200,,4555,4.914174252275683

Incidentally I had written to the UK producers of this DVD twice without getting any reply.

Having said all this, this is another great adventure with Sean and Daragh giving their usual superb performances as the two leads.

It's great to see that the story, the production values and the acting are all up at the same levels we became accustomed to.  Yes, the story significantly bends the timeline set up by author Bernard Cromwell, and bends history in general, but why quibble about this when the story is so well written and acted?  This is boys own stuff, with damsels in distress, camaraderie, and beautiful exotic women trying to seduce our hero, with a few big battle scenes overflowing with extras thrown in for good measure.  The characters have aged in the story as well as the actors in real life, such that the gap between this and the last episode makes sense, and the actors being a bit older does not detract from the enjoyment of the movie.

It's every bit as good as we have any right to expect!

The movie is presented in 'as seen' format - so we have it in two episodes, which distractingly means that in the middle of the story you get a 'Next time on Sharpe..' and then a 'Previously on Sharpe', which is annoying, but the disc is still indispensable for any Sharpe fan, or fan of quality TV in general.

The villain of the piece is a renegade British officer serving as the general of a rebellious Indian princeling.  His identity is supposedly unknown, and part of the 'mission' of Sharpe is to find out who he is (although he has been in command there for some 15 years, raising hell in the local area) and rescue his old comrade Patrick, who had been sent previously on the same mission. Good idea!  Send an Irishman to India to work undercover!  Who would know?  And despite months of exposure to the Indian sun, neither Patrick, nor Sharpe have so much as a light glow, let alone a tan or sunburn!  Pasty people in Peshawar?  Oh please!

2614435,3,B000GIXLWU,"Since first seeing Sean Bean in TV reruns in 1999 in the role of Richard Sharpe, the lowly soldier who is given a field commission by Wellington for saving his life, I have been a devoted fan. Subsequently, I bought the whole series on VHS, some of the Sharpe novels & even several volumes of Napier's War in the Peninsula so I could better follow the action and Sharpe's character as he rises through the ranks.

Naturally, I was quite excited when a new episode, Sharpe's Challenge, appeared on DVD. It is based on 3 novels, which chronologically were set before the Peninsular (ie Napoleonic) War but the script has been re-worked so that it is set after the Wars, mainly I supppose so that the aging - but still handsome - Sean Bean does not have to play a twenty-year old.

The film has everything going for it - colourful locations in India, battles, skirmishes, elephants, explosions, old friends Patrick Harper & Romona, the Duke of Wellington, beautiful young women, dastardly villains, even Sharpe's old bete noire, the ridiculous Col. Simmerson. I give the producers 3 stars for effort.

And yet -- something is missing. Like so many hit productions, it has become a victim of its own success. It is all spectacle and no heart. I could not get emotionally involved in this film as I had in the earlier Sharpe series. It was - dare I say it - boring.

2614444,5,B000GIXLWU,"You bought the special edition boxed set of 14 DVDs, with map.  You watched them all in one sitting.  (WOW!)  You went on-line and got all the lyrics to ""Over the Hills,"" and sing it all over the house.

Now get the next adventure that Richard Sharpe faces.  As usual, Sharpe and his blood brothers manage to overcome impossible odds, represented this time by a rogue British officer, who is advising a princeling who wants to rule the area.  Sharpe had met this man years before, when he slaughtered an entire outlying fort.  Now he faces him again, infiltrating his army, getting close to him to...

But that might give it away, wouldn't it?

""Challenge"" is another good story in the Sharpe's series, one I very much recommend to all you fans.",1167782400,2,745,4.583333333333333
2614445,4,B000GIXLWU,This latest episode in the Sharpe adventures was much anticipated and mostly met expectations. The budget was obviously smaller than a theatrical release and that was apparent in production values but the story was good and the actors seemed to fall back into their roles very easily. It was impressive that the crew was able to film in India. Do we believe Richard Sharpe turned down a beautiful woman? Hmmmmm....that was the real challenge.,1163894400,2,442,4.986486486486487
2614446,5,B000GIXLWU,"I highly reccommend this for any fan of the original 14 episode series, this was an eagerly awaited and long overdue return of Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean).  While this movie is taken out of timeline context with the original series of books by Bernard Cornwell, it is a worthy addition to the original BBC series.  Sean Bean reprises his role as Richard Sharpe, ten years later, and is as wonderful as ever. Because lets face it, no one could do it better.  If you are a fan, you'll be left wanting more and more.  But I fear this is the final chapter in the episodic enterprise for the BBC.  But take heart, Bernard Cornwell continues to churn out ever more adventures of our beloved Richard Sharpe, and I for one will continue to enjoy Sharpe for as long as he cares to write about him.",1163030400,2,787,4.4

Thank you.

2614448,3,B000GIXLWU,"It is okay. It lacked a sense of adventure. Perhaps the actors are tired of the parts but somehow it just wasn't all that good. The fight scenes just didn't seem convincing.

  As a fan of the Sharpe books and past videos (I have them all), I wish I had seen it on TV because I probably would not have purchased it.

  The added features are interesting. The making of the video in particular. But, if you are a fan, you should purchase it for your collection. It is not all that bad just not that good.",1163030400,,503,4.134020618556701
2614449,5,B000GIXLWU,"A great addition to the Sharpe Series of DVDs and Books. Fans of Bernard Cornwell's hero Richard Sharpe will greatly enjoy this new exploit. Based on three novels(Sharpe's Tiger, Sharpe's Triumph and Sharpe's Fortress) by Bernard Cornwell,it places Sharpe in India shortly after the Napoleonic Wars. He looking for his good friend Patrick Harper and putting down an insurrection at the same time. Its great fun.",1163030400,,411,5.242424242424242
2614450,4,B000GIXLWU,"this video follows in the grand tradition of the Sharpe's series but in order to make the ageing of the lads more plausible, an earlier book in the series was manipulated to put Sharpie back in the field - his latest wife dispensed with in a sentence.  Although Sean Bean can still fit into his rifleman's uniform, the boys are getting a bit long in the tooth.  All of us Sharpaholics can only regret that the BBC was not prescient enough to make a dozen more episodes before killing off the Chosen Men at Waterloo. I watched  an older, wiser Sharpe and and older Harper and realized that I was older too.  I think this will be the last time Sharpe and Harper march.",1163030400,,666,4.346774193548387
2614451,5,B000GIXLWU,"Sean Bean is terrific at everything he does, but Sharpe is the epitome of the perfect role for him!  I have all the ""Sharpe's"" stories, and this one is icing on the cake!  Here's hoping they come out with more!  He's good, whether he is the hero or antihero, but I love him best as the ""good guy""!  Cannot get enough of this actor!",1163030400,,331,4.125

8132985,3,B000GIXLWU,"Fans of the Sharpe tv series will probably enjoy this one.  I did, but not as much as most of the earlier ones.  Many plot details just do not make sense.  For instance, the British had to send Sergeant Harper on a mission to learn the identity of a renegade Englishman who has been active in India as a renegade for 10 to 15 years.  Really?  They never noticed him enough to do something about him in all that time? Why Harper? is not well explained.  There is no reference to his having expertise in Indian affairs.  If you are a viewer who pays attention to plot, not just action, you will notice other things which make little sense.
