8563253,3,B00B6DTGOQ,"I'm feeling very generous here already for giving this series three stars. Seriously it's so bland that my exact rating for it would probably fall somewhere between 2.5 and 2.9 stars, but anyway...

Just like another reviewer says. The characters, especially that Hatsuki guy, are so bland and have very little personality. The lead character, Hatsuki, falls in EVERY WAY POSSIBLE to make you care for him. Seriously I didn't care if in the end he didn't get that girl he wanted. I didn't care if in the last episode he died. I didn't godd**n care if the ghost would or would not return his body to him. He's that terrible.

Now, he's not a bad guy. He's decent enough, but the reason I rant about him so much is because his face showed ABSOLUTELY NO EXPRESSION WHATSOEVER throughout the series. How can you even like a character whose emotions seem to have been taken away from him? Seriously the ghost - the dead husband Shimao - had more emotions in store (and was much better looking than our supposedly 'protagonist'.)

The girl Rokka somehow just seems to be there cause the story requires it. Same goes for Shimao's sister whose name I have forgotten.

So far, I've been holding back the worst part.

The story.

It's supposed to be interesting and funny and heartwarming, right? Right? How can one go wrong with the synopsis given?

Yeah, well, one can.

The synopsis looks so appealing. I liked the concept so much and it could have been an epic series, but NO. This turns out to be a complete waste of my time of 240+ minutes watching this crap. I'm usually easily moved to tears by good movies and I consider myself to be rather sentimental, but I didn't shed a single tear while watching this. Instead, I yawned at least a hundred times throughout the series. The story was so bland and mediocre, and the pacing was way too slow. What's more, completely nonsensical scenes were added just to lengthen the timing of each episode.

There's no English dub, in case you're still thinking of buying this. Yet, this thing is not worth dubbing in the first place.

Now, the good points:

The artwork. It's good, but to be completely honest I've seen better. The better ones include Ghibli movies, Shinkai movies, Blue Exorcist, Inari Kon Kon, and most of Hosada's movies. However, talking exclusively in terms of art, Natsuyuki Rendezvous is better than Death Note.

The music is fine. I didn't find it that captivating (as opposed to another reviewer) though. Just fine. Nowhere near Natsume Yuujinchou or Your Name. (I feel disgraced already mentioning those crown jewels in the review of Natsuyuki Rendezvous. Apologies Natsume creators and Shinkai & his crew.)

If you still wonder just how bad it is, it might comfort you that I have requested a return for a refund. Never done this before with ANY item from Amazon; congrats Natsuyuki, you're the first.

Maybe one day I'll take a star off, given how much I rant about this thing.",1489968000,,2941,4.6854368932038835
8563254,5,B00B6DTGOQ,A beautiful series and came in time for my best friend's birthday. If you're a fan of the Jousei genre or of slice of life with a psychological (and a little bit of a supernatural twist) then here's an anime for you!,1473897600,,216,4.166666666666667

8563256,1,B00B6DTGOQ,This series started out promising but degenerated into a manipulative ghost who could not let go - he takes over the body of his wife's new love interest and traps him in his book - where he spends 85% of the series. He even haunts her grand daughter! One of the most disappointing series I have seen; it lets the viewer down and never lets them see how their (the living people's) relationship develops.,1417564800,2,404,4.472972972972973

He thinks that this is Rokka's live-in boyfriend and is crushed.  However, turns out this man is Rokka's dead husband Atsushi.

8563258,5,B00B6DTGOQ,"I have an admission.  I actually don't watch a lot of Drama Anime.  I've always been a Sci-Fi and Mecha kind of fan.  However, I LOVED Natsuyuki Rendezvous.  It was really rare for me to get that can't wait feeling to watch the next episode anymore.  I did with Natsuyuki.
The basic plot premise is that a single floral shop owner, befriends a customer, who is infatuated with her.  He ends up taking a part time job at the shop to just get to know her.  However, the manager has a secret, she's been married before.  Her previous husband has died, and poor Hazuki can see his ghost still haunting the manager.  Of course, enter love triangle and hilarity ensues.
I might be kind of a pansy for saying this, but this is a series that you'll laugh and you'll cry.  They give the characters a lot of life and very realistic in their motives.  Not much seems too over the top, even with the concept.  Add in some great imagery and character growth, some metaphors about growing old, and death...and it really turns into a beautiful series.
The main character of Hazuki, is priceless, and most can relate to him all too much about an in-fatuous relationship with someone that we have only briefly met.  Hazuki starts the story talking about his meaningless trips to the floral shop to always buy plants that he doesn't need, and rings all too true at certain times in most of our lives.  Who hasn't bought those 4 Smartphone chargers just because of the cute person at the Cell Store, right?
I've never seen a slightly abnormal love story affect me so much as Natsuyuki Rendezvous.  You'll get some VERY mixed reviews on Natsuyuki.  You'll either love it, or you'll hate it.  It can be much like Mushi-shi in that regard.  Section 23's disk product hasn't been released, and I have not seen the masters they might have.  I've seen it mostly in 720 recordings, and it is an assumption that the DVD product will be the same.
I know it can be a tough sale without many Anime rental programs available.  However, I thoroughly recommend that you save some pennies and pick up these series, if you like beautiful and heartfelt TV, I don't think it will disappoint.",1368230400,11,2154,4.5310880829015545
8563259,3,B00B6DTGOQ,"Just becomes a painful march through bad characters and poor story.

The dead husband and Hazuki interacting is perfect. For a few episodes this will have you watching. But the trouble with the story is, you just couldn't believe Hazuki's emotions. His face is always dull and drab. Love? He shows almost no sign of emotion. Really I've never seen a more emotional emotionless protagonist in my life. The female lead pretty much carries the story but even later her character does some rather bizarre things. The chemistry between her and Hazuki just isn't there. Many scenes are just awkward.

I'm a fan of Josei style shows. They usually are quite good. But this series completely squanders it. Not to mention the hideous outfits the female protagonist wears. This really impacts the believability of her character at times because you will get caught up on the outfit wondering if she is seriously going out dressed like that and how Hazuki could ever see anything in her.

3/5 is very generous for this series. I really want to hate it but I did enjoy the banter between the husband and Hazuki as well as the backstory before the husband died. Really if they would have told that story the series would have been a fantastic tear jerker. But in the end we are stuck with stone face Hazuki and some really terrible character chemistry. Give this show a rent if you must, otherwise, avoid.",1364688000,5,1391,4.716049382716049
