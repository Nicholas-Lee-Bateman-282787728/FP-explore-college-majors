4666923,3,B005EMKD7E,I received the DVD in the mail in a few days. I was so excited because I finally own the DVD after watching it online. But I noticed some of my favorite scenes were cut off and they were the most important parts. So I'm very unhappy about it.,1379116800,3,242,3.9591836734693877
4666924,5,B005EMKD7E,"I really love this drama for the acting, the songs, and for the inspirational messages that occurred throughout the drama. This drama really made me interested in listening to more Kpop music ^_^",1357516800,5,195,4.9393939393939394
4666925,5,B005EMKD7E,"I love Korean drama because most of the Korean drama look real story, real acting, and when they cry it look real. That's what make a good Drama funny, interesting, and feelings.",1343174400,2,178,4.59375
4666926,4,B005EMKD7E,"A Korean series that would likely appeal to anyone that liked ""High School Musical"" -- the show is an excellent mixture of drama and music. The music, in particular, is very good - lots of different styles, fun staged productions, the singers are all very talented.  It takes a few episodes to sort out the characters, but in the end all the characters, even the ""villains"" display some redeeming qualities. Kim Soo Hyu's portrayal of Sam Dong alone would make the series worth watching, but the entire cast is engaging and fun. My only real complaint is that the structure of the High School is a bit confusing and unrealistic -- I can't see any parent putting up with their kids being treated the way these children are treated by the school staff, particularly if the parents are paying extra for the children to attend the school.  But I've noticed most high school dramas have really strange portrayals of the school system, I suppose this one not much worse than the fictional high schools in other movies/series.",1336867200,,1019,4.751412429378531
4666927,3,B005EMKD7E,"This is another Kdrama distributed by PohKim. Ghosted distributer's name going across the screen, dumb. The series ended up being okay but it takes a while for the main female character to become likeable. It was uneven. You are not always sure who you should cheer for. This was NOT one of my favorites.",1332028800,2,304,4.648148148148148
8468706,3,B005EMKD7E,Good quality,1501027200,,12,5.5
8468707,4,B005EMKD7E,"The show itself is phenomenal of course, so I won't bother rambling about that. The only thing I would change if possible is the subtitles. They are sometimes too slow or too fast, and occasionally aren't even there at all. Overall it doesn't affect the storyline so it's bearable, but it's mostly a nuisance. Also, there is a logo that pops up and kind of drifts across the screen every now and then. That too would be bearable but it happens at the worst times. A very serious scene came on and the logo flashed all over the place and was extremely distracting. Other than those issues, the show itself and the quality was excellent and highly recommended. Just know that it will likely annoy OCD people like myself.",1483228800,,718,4.573643410852713

8468710,5,B005EMKD7E,"I love this TV show. It's my favorite of any TV show in any language from any country. That being said, there are some things that you should probably be aware of when you buy this DVD set.

First of all, if you want subtitles, it only comes with English and Chinese. Secondly, there have been some definite changes made to the music of this show, and I think that will be the biggest complaint you hear/read from other customers. Basically, just about every non-Korean song from this show was either deleted or substituted with a Korean song; my guess, a JYP Entertainment song. In fact, the only song in English I can think of right now that wasn't deleted was Mandy Moore's 'Only Hope'. I don't know this for certain, but based on my experience with older movies and shows where this happened, I'm guessing that either JYP Entertainment couldn't attain the rights to sell the music, or they just didn't want to pay for it, so they decided to sub out the songs with their own. Examples of this in this show include, but are not limited to, Ke$ha's 'Tick Tock' (episode 7), the song that Jason dances to before getting scolded by Miss Shi (episode 7), the first half of the bird dance from the dance competition (episode 9), the dance battle song in Japan (episode 10), and the song that Beak Hee dances to alone at night (episode 14). If you didn't know that these songs weren't originally there, you probably wouldn't think twice about it, and even though I liked the original dance competition and dance battle songs better, these new ones worked pretty well. Then again, maybe that's just because I'm a diehard 2PM fan.

The most SUBSTANTIAL changes that you'll notice are the two scenes that I noticed were deleted: the transition period between the 200 days, when Pil Suk sings 'Video Killed The Radio Star' and Pil Suk's EMG audition video. I was fine living without the audition video, but I'll admit, I was disappointed by the transition scene being removed; not because the song meant that much to me, but because to jump from being told how to eat to the scene where Group K arrives at school (there is a 200-days-later caption, which helped) without that transitional period felt very choppy and abrupt.

The biggest DISAPPOINTMENT for me was a scene in episode 15, where Jin Man is suggesting terrible group names and everyone keeps ignoring him. Originally, they used the Star Wars theme song, but they deleted that, as well, which made me want to cry. Also, there is occasionally (and I do mean occasionally, like once every few episodes) a watermark that appears across the screen. Didn't really bother me, but I know that it will bother some people. That aside, I still stand firm on the belief that this show is one of the greatest ever made. If you haven't seen it before, I do advise that you force yourself to watch through episode 5, regardless of how much you hate the main character. Trust me, she gets a lot better, and episode 5 is really the turning point at which you begin to fall for her.",1453161600,6,3019,4.587037037037037
