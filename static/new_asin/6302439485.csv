469522,4,6302439485,"Marilyn Monroe does a good job portraying a mentally disturbed woman babysitting a little girl in a hotel.  The rest of the cast is fine too.  The script is a bit clumsy at times, but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie.  If you've only seen Marilyn portray empty-headed blondes, you should watch ""Don't Bother to Knock"" to get a different look at her.  Her character ""Nell"" is a sad, pathetic figure.",1043625600,2,418,4.533333333333333
469523,4,6302439485,"Another beautifully restored tribute to one of the biggest stars of all time. (If you don't own the first diamond collection, get it.)
The best film of this package is ""Don't bother to knock."" It shows a different side to Marilyn, the one rarely seen. Usually typecast as the ""chipper, dumb blonde,"" Marilyn shows off her dramatic talent in this dark film. She's more than a pretty face. She showcases her acting ability to the point where she is completely unrecognizable from her other films.
She'll blow you away with her comedic performance in ""let's make love,"" and leave you mystified in the beautifully filmed ""Niagara."" I'm not a big western fan, but still found ""River of no return"" to be quite entertaining. ""Monkey business"" was my least favorite of the package, but that had more to do with the casting error of Cary Grant. He didn't suit his character, at least not to me.
Overall, a very entertaining movie set, much like the first. But ""Don't bother to knock,"" offers the biggest bang for your buck. She'll mesmerize you with the best things about her: her talent and her mind.
After all, it takes more than a pretty face for a girl to coin the phrase, ""I'm like this entire superstructure with absolutely no foundation. But I'm working on the foundation.""",1025913600,8,1271,4.72972972972973

469525,4,6302439485,"Marilyn Monroe proves she really could act in this film, a chilling psychological thriller set in a luxury hotel.  Also starring Richard Widmark and Anne Bancroft, DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK is a fascinating film.
Monroe plays a psychotic babysitter assigned to look after a little girl in a big hotel.  Her past is cloudy and she seems shy and withdrawn.  Also in the hotel in a lounge singer (Anne Bancroft) and her old flame (Widmark).
The young man finds his way to the babysitter's room, and she passes herself off as the occupant, wearing a fancy robe and diamond earrings ""borrowed"" from the girl's mother.
He takes a liking to her, but when he discovers her dangling the girl from a window, he decides to call the police.......
Monroe gives an emotionally vulnerable performance here.  She is remarkably good, which makes me wonder why studios only gave her ""cheesecake movies"" instead of the roles and movies she knew she could do.
Top shelf entertainment.",986169600,22,960,4.835365853658536
469526,5,6302439485,"Marilyn is so amazing in her role of Nell, the psychotic babysitter, who is hired for one night to babysit an 8 year old girl.  Her uncle is the elevator jockey, and he gets her the job.  She has just moved to NYC after being released from an institution.  She attempted suicide after her lover is killed in WWII. At the hotel, she meets Jed, played excellently by Richard Widmark.  I think him and Monroe had a great chemistry together.  Jed doesn't have a very understand heart at first, but by the end of the night he is a changed man.  They meet looking across into each other's hotel rooms and decide to chat in her room.  The little girl, Bunny, is bothered by him being there and makes problems for Nell.  Nell does everything she can to keep the girl away.  She even almost kills her!  MM mesmerizes me everytime I watch any scene from this film.  She is very expressive, and she just delivers an awesome performance.  I think she should have stuck to dramatic roles.",985910400,8,975,4.415730337078652
469527,4,6302439485,"I'm not really a big fan of baby sitter movies, but I wouldn't mind the young Marilyn baby sitting me, if you know what I mean. People say she acts great in this movie, playing a loopy suicidal chick, but in her case, this turned out to be too close to the truth. I'm a 1940s and 50s sort of guy, so I feel right at home in this movie. From the match girl to the seen-it-all bartender, these are my people and they speak my language.",972086400,7,433,3.9885057471264367
469528,4,6302439485,"Don't Bother To Knock is a dark psycho-drama that serves as a vehicle for Marilyn Monroe's mesmerizing performance.  As Nell, a mentally unstable woman whose lover was killed in WWII, Monroe delivers a creepy performance.  Hired for the night to babysit a little girl (Donna Corcoran) Nell drifts  in and out of reality.  Director Roy Baker draws out desperate emotionalism  from Monroe, who is eerily convincing with her lines, and facial  expressions.  Richard Widmark plays Jed, a cold hearted pilot who cannot  understand why his lounge singer girlfriend ( Anne Bancroft) has jilted  him.  Elisha Cook Jr. once again delivers a fine supporting role as the  hotel elevator operator caught up in his nieces's (Nell's) strange  behavior.  The film is almost entirely shot within the confines of a hotel  room and Baker's camera work and tight cutting adds to the suspense.  Don't  Bother To Knock definitely opened the door to Monroe's career.",963446400,27,944,5.1118421052631575
469529,5,6302439485,"A very young Marilyn acts as a psychotic baby-sitter. This is not a comedy in which she plays her typical dumb-blonde role later in her career. This slow-moving drama is a favorite among serious Marilyn fans because she  rarely played dramatic roles (The Misfits is the only other 'serious' film  I can think of offhand). To see this film is to see another side of  Marilyn. Her acting is natural and flows well, maybe because she already  had such a tragic life, even at this point. Again serious fans will love  this movie.",955324800,5,525,4.602150537634409
469530,4,6302439485,"As an avid MM fan, I remember reading that Marilyn didn't require any retakes when filming Don't Bother To Knock.  She is simply amazing in this film as the disturbed young woman who just wants love and doesn't want  anything to get in her way.. even an 8 year old girl.  Not the best of her  films, but worth a look as she is performs so greatly and without any error  with her lines.",925084800,6,385,4.148648648648648

469610,4,6302439485,Unusually good performance by Ms. Monroe. She was a lot better actress than people gave her credit for. She played a very believe troubled woman. Too bad she got so type-cast as the bimbo. Another excellent performance is in Niagara.,1502409600,,233,4.85
469611,3,6302439485,"Just an OK movie that is actually outclassed by the superstar who stars in it. The movie can't decide what it wants to be about so it's kind of all over the map. Is it about mental illness? Is it about child abuse? Is it a romance? Is it a film noir? Is it about broken dreams? Sort of yes to all of those and that's what weakens it. But it is definitely worth seeing because of Marilyn Monroe who gives a very moving and haunting performance. You can really feel the pain and emptiness and confusion of her character. So 5 stars for Marilyn, 3 stars for the movie.",1496275200,,565,4.1454545454545455

469667,3,6302439485,"Worth watching to see Marilyn Monroe in her first co-starring role -- she had appeared in 12 earlier films and critics knocked her acting abilities. Here  she is absolutely believable with many scenes of a woman with deep mental challenges. Some critics believe she was portraying her mother who also suffered from those challenges.

The movie is otherwise forgettable -- watch it for Marilyn and the beginning of the development of an excellent actress.

469816,5,6302439485,"I have been a Marilyn Monroe fan for many years since late 1981 when I found out who this woman was. I had never seen this movie before until it aired on TCM some years ago. It was released on DVD as part of The Diamond Collection. Fox has done a great job on this edition as I watched the restoration comparison before watching the movie itself. It was really looking bad by today's standards for film. Here, it looks good, but at some point when they decide to release it on Blu-ray like that of NIAGARA and the ones that followed (except TPATSG, LML), they should get a 4K scan of it.

Marilyn looks fabulous and plays a psychotic babysitter that after being released by the hospital, finds out she really isn't completely well afterall. Her Uncle helps her get a babysitting job at the hotel he is working at. Richard Widmark's character seems to be nearing an end to his relationship with the lounge singer played by Anne Bancroft. All is well until he sees and decides to call (Marilyn's character's) room and starts a chat. They become friends in some way and she begins to think that he is her former hubby coming back from the war. When the little girl she is caring for interrupts her nightly romance with the man, she becomes a dangerous woman.  A real dramatic role quite different from her earlier movies. In fact, I think it is one of her best movie roles in her career and is considered as such by many MM fans in the Marilyn Community. Moviegoers at the time were shocked that she could actually play a character that had such a dramatic role, although I think they loved her best as a comedienne. It's a bit hard to believe that Fox ""sandwiched"" her with this role between ""We're Not Married"" and ""Monkey Business"", both of which were comedies. It was two movies later, in 1953's NIAGARA, that she really began her famous rise to super stardom. The movie has a great cast including Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, and Jim Backus (The Millionaire, Gilligan's Island).

469958,3,6302439485,"You know how your mother, when you were ready to go out on your own, set up your own household and family, always harped at you to make sure to get references when you hired anybody for a service. Well maybe that advice was not so far-fetched. Maybe better references would have stopped things from going awry in the film under review, a minor Marilyn Monroe black and white film, Don't Bother to Knock.  In any case one should not rely on the recommendations of a sniveling hotel elevator operator trying to get a wayward niece gainful employee. And the minute that I saw that the referring party here, the elevator guy, was Elisha Cook, Jr., last seen as a no -account cheap gunsel in the 1941 film adaption of Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon I knew mother was onto something.

Here's the skinny. A couple staying in a New York hotel, not the Plaza from the look of it, needed a baby-sitter for the night in order  for hubby to receive some newspaper award. Presto. Elisha volunteers his niece, Nell (played by a young not blonde, Marilyn Monroe), and the deal is done. No problem right. Wrong, wrong about six different ways. I will not get into the issue of baby-sitters getting a bad rap in film, either as social monsters or as incompetents, but this Nell as it turned out had just come east from a three year stay at a mental institution. Reason; terrible parents and devastation over the loss of her World War II flyboy lover killed in a crash out in the deep.

As the film progresses Nell acts more and more erratically especially when cross-court neighbor Jed, a commercial pilot, comes a courting after a certain amount of telephone and window flirtation. Acts more erratically toward the helpless if precocious child, Bunny, in her care. Jed is strictly on the rebound since his honey, a torch-singer (played by Anne Bancroft) playing downstairs at the lounge, has called the whole thing off, saw him as just another love `em and leave `em guy and she wanted something more. So Jed is gloomy although once he copped to Nell's condition, or at least that he wanted no part of someone who was that disturbed he decided to flee back to his torch-singer, and that something more she was talking about. But not before Nell tried to vicariously seduce Jed thinking he was her dead flyboy, bopped the nervous Elisha on the head when he checked up on her, tied up the poor child, had a fight with the child's mother when she checked up, and then tried to do herself in with razorblades before she is checked and taken away (that was not her first time with the blades she had it out West and got that three year stay for her efforts). So you can what I mean about that reference thing.

Oh yah, Marilyn's performance seemed strictly out of that method acting school she belonged to, a little wooden, coming out of the blocks. A little wooden like the storyline and action of this film. If you want Monroe at her height then you had better see Some Like It Hot or The Misfits this one is strictly a rising star learning her craft.",1382745600,,3039,4.5181818181818185
469959,5,6302439485,"Because of her mesmerizing charisma, Marilyn Monroe was not required to act. By merely standing in front of the camera, she always commanded the audience's attention. But fortunately, for every viewer of this particular film, it is apparent that her highly effective dramatic acting created a far more compelling visual and auditory experience than her mere presence would warrant.

Without any noticeable effort, she creates a character who weaves in and out of reality. Initially a grounded, appealing, and ingratiating person, her character, a babysitter at a hotel, incrementally introduces brief episodes of psychosis - bouts which become more prolonged and frequent. Star Monroe easily and believably segues from sanity to derangement and back again - so smoothly and with much nuance.

This film increasingly becomes more suspenseful just as Monroe's character increasingly cannot distinguish reality from her tragic past. And as her descent progresses, the other characters - Richard Widmark's hotel room visitor, her uncle, and her babysitting charge - become witnesses and victims.

The subplot involving Widmark and Anne Bancroft is significant, as these two characters become strongly affected by the babysitter's descent into madness - and the course of their relationship shall change. And the creation of Monroe's babysitter is not merely the portrayal of psychotic behavior, but one that serves other purposes. She is an instrument providing redemption for another character, and she also exemplifies a film noir theme: the sudden occurrence of havoc and misfortune at anytime and place.

On one level, this film is an engrossing display of fine acting and wrenching drama. But it is also an admonition - in the most clement and secure environments, unpleasantness and the unexpected lurk.",1382054400,2,1805,5.482014388489208

469994,3,6302439485,"Marilyn steps out of her customary ""sexy baby"" persona (or tries to) in ""Dont' Bother To Knock""--a minor film about a troubled girl who who shouldn't be babysitting-- and the result is an odd little B-picture that is alternatingly moving and interesting, then slow and wooden, by turns.

The plot centers on Anne Bancroft as a lounge singer who's fed up with grouchy Richard Widmark. She loves the big lug, but she's troubled by his lack of ""an understanding heart"" and she half-heartedly breaks up with him. Enter Nell Forbes, niece of the elevator man who has procured her a babysitting job for a couple who is staying at the hotel. From the start, it's apparent that something is not right with Nell, who seems lost in some private world. Monroe looks dramatically different than was typical for her at the time. In frowsy dress, dark hair and almost no makeup, she is none the less still beautiful, although she carries herself as someone with little confidence, her posture is limp and her movement tentative. Her uncle, played by the wonderful character actor Elisha Cook Jr, points up Nell's instability by mentioning she has suffered the recent loss of her boyfriend in an aviation accident, and asks her incessantly if she is going to be okay. ""No mischief, alright Nell?"" In fact, Nell is just out of an asylum where she has suffered a total collapse which today would probably be diagnosed as Post Traumatic Shock Syndrome.  In Nell's case, she seems not to have quite accepted the death of her lover, and as the plot goes on, it becomes apparent that she lapses into delusions that he is still alive.

When she sees Richard Widmark through her hotel window, she decides he is her lost love and flashes the blinds to get his attention. He calls her and she invites him over for drinks. The real problems begin when her charge won't stay in bed, threatening Nell's delusion, which Widmark--distracted as he is by the promise of an easy conquest with a beautiful woman-- is slow to comprehend. When Uncle Eddie comes to check on her, things really get out of hand as she clunks him on the head with a heavy lamp just as he is about to discover the man she has stashed in the bathroom. This reawakens Bunny, whom Nell subdues with rope and gag!

Monroe has a great scene where her misdeeds have been discovered and her play-world has broken, as she zeroes in on the child she feels is to blame for everything having gone wrong. Looking around the room like a lost waif, her eyes suddenly focus, turning murderous on the door of the child's room. ""It's all your fault,"" she whispers as neighbors use her phone to call hotel security. ""We had a bargain....you devil..."" It's a chilling moment, and Monroe suffuses her characterization with real menace,  as well as pathos for a woman who is not really a villain but a victim of her own broken perception.

Staggering away from the havoc she has wrecked (and a near homicide), Monroe looks bleary, lost and completely believable,  showing a glimpse of the powerhouse performance she might have been able to deliver in stronger directorial hands. Alas, Roy Baker has not helmed ""Don't Bother to Knock"" very imaginatively, in addition to playing both sides of the fence with Monroe's persona. It's as if he couldn't decide whether to sell the film as a sexy seduction scene gone wrong, or a psychodrama, and his effort to go for something in between is not altogether successful. The script is nowhere near up to Hitchcock's level, but you can't help but imagine what he might have been able to do with it, and with Monroe.

In the end, you manage to feel sorry for Nell despite all she has done. As she's led away by policeman,  Widmark promises to continue to help her, thus winning back the heart of Bancroft, for Nell has taught him to have the ""understanding heart"" he lacked. For her part, we can only hope Nell will get the help she needs.

However, in ""Don't Bother to Knock"" this dark black-and-white film noir from 1952, a prefame Monroe shows the world that there's more to a beautiful blonde than glamour and sex. In this movie Monroe plays the mentally disturb Nell Forbes, a young who is asked to babysit a child one evening. She accepts and the trouble soon begins. Nell begins trying on the mother of the child she's babysitting clothes, wearing her perfume, earrings, and flirting with the recently broken-hearted across the way, played by Richard Widmark. She invites him over after the little girl has gone to bed. She pretends that she and her ""sister"" are the renters of the hotel room and that she's there all alone. However, secrets of Nell unravel as the plot progresses. In the end, she is stopped short of committing suicide.

470061,5,6302439485,"They say that Monroe, early on in her career, had to struggle hard with being accepted as a serious actress instead of just the dumb blonde with a knock out rack. But the producers in Hollywood never gave her a real chance to be a success doing serious roles and only until Mistfits, some nine years after this movie, did she once again get to illustrate the depth of her acting abilities.

In this movie, she is doing one of her finest acting at an already very early stage of her career - before her commercially successful and better known pictures such as How to Marry A Millionaire, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, The Seven Year Itch and of course Some Like it Hot catapulted her into stardom and then legend.

One can only imagine what she could have turned into acting-wise had she been allowed to continue on that route and fully develop and expand her abilities as an actress.  Unfortunately, Hollywood was merciless in that regard and Marilyn's success dependent very strongly on the success she could bring at the box office.  Marilyn, therefore, realized early on that she had to be able to sell and that people, as well as the studios themselves preferred her as the voluptuous blonde ditsy kitten than as the serious dramatic actress she could be; they had Liz Taylor, Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepurn for that.

This movie is from the small window in Monroe's career where she was still undamaged by Hollywood's demands on her, ultimately becoming a caricature of herself, and instead allowed to take on the role of a person with more psychological depth than any of the characters she would ever play later on in her career (except for Misfits). Richard Widwmark and Anne Bancroft do a great job as well, but they are easily overshadowed by Monroe's breathtaking radiance and screen presence.

As I said, I am still surprised that after this role she was still not taken seriously as an actor and was in fact often mocked by such serious and talented actors as Bette Davis. Maybe her beauty and extraordinary femininity were overwhelming for everyone around her, including her female counterparts, evoking jealousy and just too powerful to ignore and she could not have ever been anything else in Hollywood but what she was exhuming outwardly.

The title of this movie is horribly misleading and cheap, by the way.  It makes it sound like a silly rom-com even though it really borders at being a film noir.",1301702400,,2414,4.730952380952381

He was a pilot and died- his plane crashing into the sea. Her Uncle gets her a babysitting job for a couple and when the little girl becomes nosy, and a handful it's too much for Nell (Monroe's Character) and things start to go awry. I think Monroe gives a great performance here. You feel for her character, yet you don't want her to get away with her behavior. It's always interesting to me when a character can make you feel torn, and put you in a quandry. It's a little sad, but not a tear jerker. It's a good film, and I'm glad I saw it.

470065,3,6302439485,"Over the years I have heard about this little film, often referenced in biographies and documentaries about Marilyn Monroe, but I never actually saw it. Besides Marilyn, the movie stars Richard Widmark, and a very young Anne Bancroft.  Marilyn plays a young woman recently released from a mental institution after a breakdown following the tragic wartime death of her lover. Her uncle who works at a big hotel as bellhop, finds his niece a job babysitting a little girl for the evening while her parents attend a dinner function downstairs.  Meanwhile, Richard Widmark has had a falling out with his girlfriend, hotel chanteuse Anne Bancroft because of his reluctance to commit to a serious or permanent relationship.  While in his room he spots Marilyn across the way and decides to phone her and persuade her to let him come over.  She agrees, and weirdness ensues.  Think ""Fatal Attraction"" without the heavy sex and violence (though they try to get as much in as censors allow). Marilyn all dolled up in the mother's clothing, make-up and perfume becomes convinced that Widmark is her dead boyfriend. When the little girl wakes up before any serious reuniting can happen, the sitter really goes off the deep end (she actually winds up binding and gagging the little girl to keep her quiet and out of the way). To make a long story short, Widmark suddenly realizes that settling down with his non-crazy old girlfriend is not such a bad idea, and Marilyn is carted off to the local looney bin to receive treatment.
While having some of the elements of film noir, this movie while not a total failure, isn't really up there with similar films of the era.  It's worth watching even for unintentionally funny moments (I thought) when Anne Bancroft is singing away in her nightclub act completely ignoring the microphone in her hand which she seems to constantly hold downwards in the opposite direction far away from where her mouth is. There is some dreadful dialogue here and there, and this isn't even one of Monroe's best performances.  However, this would be an interesting movie for MM's fans because it is quite different from anything else she did in her career.  Furthermore, as over-the-top as some scenes were, Marilyn never struck me as funny. She turned in a very believable, even sympathetic performance despite shortcomings of the script.  This probably reveals more about Monroe's talent as an actress than if she was in a top-notch film.  Widmark is good as the sleazy hero and aside from the bad lip-syncing, Anne Bancroft is fine as the young but very saavy gal pal. Fun scene where Mom (Lurene Tuttle) comes back to the room and sees her kid tied up and starts to beat the tar out of the sitter.

I would have rated this video slightly higher except that it lacked the special features I really look forward to when I purchase a DVD (making of documentaries, etc). Special features that are on the disc: Restoration comparison, still gallery, previews of other Marilyn movies in the DVD series, and a theatrical trailer that demonstrates that sex sells even when there really isn't any.  The trailer has Marilyn looking fetching in her (borrowed) negligee (with a bed clearly in the background) while Widmark's character remarks ""Why didn't you tell me that you were working here?"". She replies, "" I'm not. I'm just doing it for the night."" Ahem.

The characters are developed with simple and short sequences, you can feel that their story has started long before we are introduced to them and the filmmakers are successful in giving us hints into their psyches. The camera shots are telling the story as much as the dialogue; in one scene the close up shot of a woman putting on lipstick in front of a mirror she holds in one hand while applying with the other, reveals scars on both wrists to further give information of her mental state and vulnerability. Also through carefully placed dialogue we learn of the characters' philosophy and of their personalities, like the elevator operator who is constantly apologizing to guests and fussing over them with questions; 'are you satisified with this or that during your stay'. The film understands which parts of the story needs to be in the confinements of theatrical elements, which parts need to be literary and when to use the camera shot as part of the story-telling. Considering most filmmakers do not understand the language of cinema, it is an unexpected surprise to find a film as simple as this one doing it right; Hitchcock would be proud.

470109,4,6302439485,"A very early dramatic performance from Marilyn Monroe is the highlight of this tense noir-drama, typical of the solid ""B"" product being made at Fox during the early 50's.

Marilyn Monroe is Nell, a young woman who has just emerged from a psychiatric hospital.  Relatives help Nell gain a job as babysitter to a little girl (Donna Corcoran) whose parents are attending a party in the hotel downstairs.  Whilst babysitting, Nell's attention is piqued by a handsome guy in an opposite hotel window (Richard Widmark)...

DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK (1952) is a tightly-crafted noir drama which gave Monroe an early chance to display her keen dramatic ability--though strangely, Fox execs must have missed seeing it, because from then on most of her roles at the studio weren't nearly as demanding or fascinating.  Richard Widmark has a great role as the man perplexed by a woman who is ""all silk on one side and sandpaper on the other""; and fellow Fox contract player Anne Bancroft impresses as the hotel singer.

470196,3,6302439485,"If I were to classify Don't Bother to Knock, I would put it into the rarely used category of meta-noir. All of the elements of noir are in full force here: an urban landscape, an inquisitive male lead stuck between two women, a suspenseful plot, but then the noir aspects break down. (I will be intentionally vague in the next few sentences so as not to give the plot away.) The script offers what seems like a femme fatale role, a staple of all noir, but the script blunts and softens her, and the audience must rethink and re-judge her at the close of the film. In many films noir, there is also a nurturing woman to counter the femme fatale and seduce the male lead in a more traditional way. In this film, however, there is no nurturing woman, but rather a strong, independent woman. The film seems to throw noir completely on its head, complicating stock female characters and making the male lead more dynamic than one would expect from noir. The result is a tidy vignette that argues against the noir world, yet unfortunately runs out of time before offering another world in return.

Marilyn Monroe (playing Nell Forbes) steals this film effortlessly. Because she is generally not a strong actor, it's wonderful to see Monroe so confident and subtle. I imagine that she knew Nell better than any other character she ever played. As I was watching the movie, I wondered what Monroe could have been if Hollywood had taken her more seriously and challenged her rather than relegating her to perpetual blonde bombshell. I was surprised and fascinated by the moments in this film when Monroe ceased to be attractive. She spends almost the entire film inside two adjoining hotel rooms, and it's amazing what she can do with few props and very little space.

It's been argued that the script is weak and that all the characters aside from Nell are underdeveloped. I agree that the film showcases Monroe, but the script isn't that bad. The first half of the movie is peppered with cheesy, noir one-liners and sets an intriguing mood slowly. This is intentional. Quite suddenly, a dramatic thriller sets in the second half of the film, the canned dialogue gets tossed, and the noir elements unravel quickly.

Any Monroe fan should treasure this film, but even those who find most of her other films silly should give this one a chance. It's a glimpse of Monroe as she could have been.",1187913600,8,2383,4.669047619047619
470197,5,6302439485,"Before there was Swimfan (2002, which is only being listed because it fits the genre, not because it is great), The Crush (1993), Fatal Attraction (1987) or even Play Misty for Me (1971), there was ""Don't Bother to Knock"" (1952).  The conduit between all of the former movies is one key element; the antagonist is a woman suffering from borderline personality disorder/BPD.  In simple terms, women who are a bit cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs and there is no milk in sight.

This movie is somewhat of a departure of the Marilyn Monroe that we all knew in her cinematic career.  Her character of Nell is dark, disturbed and doleful.  Consequently, these character traits make her anything but monotonous.  It mirrors the hidden dangerous and dandy motives to her character.  The thing I like about Monroe in this movie is it wasn't the usual role for her.  She wasn't all ""dolled up"", meaning she didn't have  pounds of make-up on, her hair wasn't vivid blonde and her clothes were more conservative than other roles she has performed before and after this film.

Don't get me wrong, all the prior listed traits were wonderful and made Monroe very, very sexy.  However, this seemed like a more stripped down performance.  I felt this only added to the arcane quality of presentation.  In many ways Marilyn Monroe is remembered for her role in ""The Seven Year Itch"" or the bright and sleek dress she wore in ""Niagara"" or even her musical number in ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"".  This is fine, but almost puts that stigma of ""sexy dumb blonde"".  If nothing else, ""Don't Bother to Knock"" displays that Marilyn Monroe wasn't a total one trick pony.

Of course Monroe's character Nell isn't totally devoid of the sexiness Monroe played in her films.  There is still the breathy voice and erotic vibe that she always sported, just differently.  As for Nell being too unstable or ""psycho"" to be sexy, I beg to differ.  Nell would be classified as a person who suffers from borderline personality disorder, as noted prior. Therefore, it isn't that impossible to see her character as both ""sexy and psycho"".  One of the real and tangible things that most BPD women have is their looks.  It is their secret weapon, because (most) of these women with BPD have a real hard time with true intimacy and identity.  Therefore, the one solid and tangible thing they possess is their sex appeal.

As for plot, the entire 76 minute movie takes place in a hotel.  Nell is hired to baby sit for a couple while they are at a business dinner in the lobby of the hotel.  She got this job via nepotism, her cousin the bellhop.  Enter Richard Widmark, who plays the perfect part as the ""average guy"" down on his luck.  When presented with the situation of ""hooking up"" with Nell after he breaks up from his girlfriend (played by a young Anne Bancroft). Mr. Widmark appears totally genuine and enthusiastic with the invitation to room 809.

In conclusion, this movie is a nice slice of quasi-film noir (shot in black and white) and is both entertaining and unique, given that the movie was made in the early 1950s.  Friends or foes of Marilyn Monroe's work might find it hard to deny ""Don't Bother to Knock"" as one of her most atypical performances.  The DVD has the original trailer/preview for ""Don't Bother to Knock"", and a preview for the Diamond Collection (selected films from Marilyn Monroe's resume).  There is also a restoration comparison showing what this movie looked like before and after it was re-mastered.

470201,2,6302439485,"'Don't Bother to Knock' looks promising from the outside. What could be better than seeing Marilyn Monroe give one of her few dramatic performances? After all, she was great in 'The Misfits', decent in 'Bus Stop' and 'Niagra'. This one is good too, right?
Wrong. This film is horrible. Honestly the preview for this film (the trailer is an extra on the DVD) is so cheesy this film would have worked better as a parody. Of course, it was 1952, so I guess they didn't realize films still had a long way to go. A weak attempt to be a noir/dramatic/suspense film that just doesn't cut it. The script is weak, the characters are flat and underdeveloped, and the acting is embarassing. Although many Monroe fans may be smitten with her acting in this film, I'm not buying it. The breathy,  sex goddess voice just doesn't cut it for a mentally deranged chick. Instead her portrayal comes off as a weak cross between trying to be a psycho and trying to be sexy. You could see Monroe still wanted her character to be sexually appealing (or maybe it was the producers who wanted her character to be sexually appealing) and that just doesn't work for a psychotic character. Whether or not it's a sex goddess actress playing a psychotic character doesn't matter. The line between bringing an actor's personality into a character should not be crossed, and in this case, it is. We cannot help but see Nell as 'Marilyn Monroe trying to play a psycho' instead of just 'Nell the psycho'. Monroe's attempt at drama is interesting to watch, but at times, cringeworthy. By this time, she may have perfected her ability at playing bombshells but not yet drama. It is safe to say Monroe's dramatic acting would certainly improve later on (re: 'The Misfits'). But as terrible as 'Don't Bother to Knock' is, the film should not be completely ignored, it's a good piece of memorabilia for movie fans. We get to see Monroe with darker hair and less makeup and watch as a young Anne Bancroft makes her film debut. If you must watch it, watch only for the two young actress (one a future legend, the other a future Academy Award winner) who would go on to achieve much greater things with their lives.",1164844800,5,2174,4.603092783505154

Each highly entertaining gem in this delicious ""Diamond Collection"" are classics to be enjoyed over and over again for anyone who enjoys the finest the world of entertainment has to offer!  ""Don't Bother To Knock"" is an amazing hauntingly brilliant performance early in Marilyn's career showing chilling dramatic range while ""Monkey Business"" is a fun romp showing off Monroe's great comic ability.

""Let's Make Love"" was way ahead of its time and the concept of intergrating musical numbers in to story line used to great success some ten years later in ""Cabaret"".

470203,3,6302439485,"I found this film-noir(ish) B-Movie very disturbing to watch.

After having read 16 books about Marilyn,it is obvious that this role must have been very difficult for her to play. To say that Marilyn was emotionally-unbalanced is the understatement of the Year;therefore,playing such a confused character was a little too close to home for her. I would disagree with the people talking about 'good-acting';she was simply playing herself,with no pretense,no mask,so you get to see Marilyn 'au-naturel',with all her demons,and the fact that she was terrified to go insane just like her mother,grand-mother,and one of her uncles. If you fast-forward her career to a little less than 10 years later,you see the same kind of confusion in 'The Misfits',that semi-autobiographical written soon-to-be-ex-husband Arthur Miller. That man was very cruel to expose her with all her idiosyncrasies,but then again Orson Welles had done the same thing with Rita Hayworth in 'The Lady From Shangai'.Two bitter men realising that they were fighting a losing battle with Legends,and they made sure that were giving them one last kick in the ribs,before signing those divorce papers.

To get back to 'Don't Bother to Knock':a special delight is to see Anne Bancroft in her film-debut when she was still using her real family name (Italiano),before Hollywood sat back and realised what a gifted actress she was.(that took a while,Ms. Bancroft would appear in 'Gorilla at Large' 2 years later).Widmark is as good as usual,and seems to be as confused by the character Monroe plays,as he is by Marilyn-the person.

Fake jewelry maybe.  And to twist a line from ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend,"" I do mean rhinestones.
Don't Bother To Knock:  As disturbed babysitter Nell, MM's dramatic talents come into play.  Nell is a timid soul who has led by a bad life.  When lonely pilot Jed Towers comes in for a drink, she mistakes him for the love who was lost in war.  Things fall apart when her charge interrupts their kiss and a psychotic desire for revenge on the little girl begins.  The best movie in this collection, with MM giving a performance other than a buxom blonde or secretary.  (Rating:  3)
Let's Make Love:  MM is Amanda Dell, a stage actress in a revue designed to spoof billionaire Jean-Marc Clement, who falls in love with her and pretends to be a Clement impersonator.  Amanda is the most sympathetic character in this cockle-doodle-doo of a movie.  A tepid script, dialogue, characters, and a waste of talent sink this movie, which is among the worst of her career.  Her acting, well, that's different.  (Rating:  2)
Monkey Business:  MM is secretary Lois Laurel at Oxley Chemicals, where a chimp's formula for youth makes immature goons out of chemist Barnaby Fulton and his wife Edwina.  This look at the nostalgia of regaining one's youth could've been better.  A thankless role of MM, who barely comes out at all, and ends up having rubber bands shot at her rear end. (Rating:  3)
Niagara:  The beauty of Niagara Falls nearly takes center stage if not for a certain wiggling blonde in a hot pink dress who sizzles as her favourite record is playing.  The adulterous Rose Loomis (MM) plots to kill her neurotic husband George with the help of her lover, but things go wrong.  Involved in this picture are a nice honeymooning couple, the Cutlers.  MM's infamous undulating walk debuted here.  (Rating:  3).
River Of No Return:  What do you say about a Grade-Z western where Marilyn wins out over the scenery and script?  As less as possible.  Seriously though, MM plays Kay, a saloon singer and girlfriend of a gambler Harry Weston who in a desperate hurry to file a gold claim, steals the horse of recently released ex-con Matt Calder.  Matt, his son Mark, and Kay brave the raging white river, bandits, and Indians.  Matt is determined to kill Harry, and Kay is determined to stop him, but along the way, realizes how kind and unselfish Matt is.  (Rating:  3).

470252,3,6302439485,"While staying at the Franklin Hotel, Jed Towers, whose girlfriend, singer Lyn Leslie has broken up with him because he has a cynical attitude and lacks what she wants in a man, ""an understanding heart"", spots a young woman in the room directly across his from the courtyard.  That woman happens to be Nell, who is babysitting for Peter and Ruth Jones while the former is downstairs accepting an award for notable editorials.  She got the job thanks to her uncle, Eddie, an elevator man at the hotel.  Smarting from the reasons Lyn gave him, he calls her up, then comes over to her room.  Little does her know his encounter with her transforms him from the mean, glib, cynic to someone more compassionate.
Yes, Nell's pretty enough, and he sees she is dressed in a nice kimono, with earrings and a bracelet.  What he doesn't know is that those things belong to Ms. Jones.  He learns several things about her.  One, she had an abused childhood.  Two, she has clearly mistaken him for an old flame who died during World War II and is in love with him.  Three, she flies into a rage when Bunny, her young and sleepless charge, catches them kissing.  And four, he sees scars on both her wrists.
The major debit of this film is the heavy-handedness of the story, the lack of any memorable dialogue, and not too many sympathetic characters.  Also, not much detail is given about Nell's childhood, and how she came to be this way.
Elisha Cook Jr. does well as Eddie, extending the nervousness he did as Wilmer in The Maltese Falcon with genuine concern.  And this is Anne Bancroft's debut film, where she plays Lyn.  Also, fans of Gilligan's Island will recognize Jim Backus (Thurston Howell III) as Mr. Jones.
Which leads to Marilyn.  This was quite a change for her after playing one single-dimensional blonde after another.  She plays Nell, initially a quiet, brooding, listless, introverted woman, who gets a suddenly comes to life when she sees Jed, then mentally disintegrates in the course of events.  Initial critics said she floated as opposed to sinking or swimming.  I say she veers more on the swim side.  She's seen clutching her hands together, symbolizing how she's trying to hang on to herself, and the scene where the camera shows her wrists foretells the madness to come.  Indeed, Jed's remark that ""you're a gal with a lot of variations"" is apropos, coupled with his remark that she's ""silk on one side and sandpaper on the other.""
Another technique is the mirror, which Nell looks upon when she puts on Ms. Jones' things, which mirrors her delusion, of the things she painfully yearns for and thinks she would've gotten if her lover hadn't perished in the war.  It also mirrors the fantasy stories she tells Jed, like the hotel room being hers, her going to South America, a fantasy atmosphere that gradually unravels as things fall into place.  In short, the mirror reflects Nell's inability to tell fantasy from reality.
Other credits of this film includes the fact that due to budget constraints, director Roy Ward Baker, best known for the Hammer Dracula films of the 70's, did only one take throughout, the results of which are impressive in its own right.  Another is that Marilyn did not need a retake, a leitmotif in her later films like Some Like It Hot.
Worth watching if only to judge if the critics, who dismissed Marilyn's blank expression in an attempt to take on a mentally unbalanced person, were right, or if this is a sign of the acting abilities she would demonstrate in her better movies, so please don't automatically dub this Don't Bother To Watch.  I did and Marilyn passes with a B+ in acting.",1074816000,4,3629,4.6803149606299215
470253,5,6302439485,"Anyone who says Marilyn Monroe was not a talented dramatic actress has never seen Don't Bother to Knock, a darkly unique entry among Marilyn's filmography.  This film marks Marilyn's first dramatic starring role, and it is Marilyn as you would never see her again.  She plays Nell, a deeply troubled young lady whose shyness and aloofness at first prove to be only the tip of the iceberg in relation to her problems.  She has recently moved to New York to start her life over again, and her helpful uncle, an elevator operator in a grand hotel, has arranged for her to baby-sit a wealthy couple's little girl for the night.  This, as soon becomes apparent, was not a good idea.  Her behavior becomes stranger and stranger as the night progresses, exacerbated by the attentions of a young man (Richard Widmark) who comes calling on the rebound after seeing her from the room across the way.  His girl has just broken things off with him downstairs, but the simple diversion he seeks in the form of some drinks and kicks with a beautiful stranger becomes something else entirely.  As the roots and degree of Nell's problems are slowly revealed, the film takes on a very dark tone charged with suspense.
Marilyn delivers a truly incredible performance in this early performance from 1952.  Her aura of innocence and vulnerability plays perfectly in her role as Nell, and the range of emotions she conveys as the film progresses is amazingly convincing, making her character one who must be feared as much as sympathized with.  I can't find a single weak spot in her performance, and I imagine the melancholy side of her true nature, the Norma Jean in her, served as a source of inspiration and strength for her in this demanding role.
This movie is quite overlooked today, with most people associating Niagara or even Gentlemen Prefer Blondes with Marilyn's first starring role, but those who see this movie will most likely never be able to forget it.  Sadly, some of the plot summaries I have read elsewhere (including the back covers of the Marilyn Monroe Collection videos) over dramatize things, saying Nell and Jed (Widmark) end up in bed together at one point or labeling Nell as a murderess.  Such sensational claims are not true, and there is nothing remotely sexy about this movie.  It is a serious and powerful dramatization of a deeply troubled young lady fighting some very real personal demons in a place and time she is quite ill suited for.  Marilyn's performance won critical praise and helped make 1952 the year that launched her into superstardom.",1057622400,3,2563,4.810933940774487
470254,5,6302439485,"This is perhaps Marilyn's best on screen performance (it also happens to be my personal favorite). Staring as Nell Forbes, a lovesick, and slightly unstable young woman who lands a babysitting job at a live in hotel, this is her first staring vehicle. Richard Widmark also stars as the object of her imagination, who's been recently dumped by his girlfriend Lyn Leslie (a lounge singer played by an incredibly young looking Anne Bancroft). Things began to get interesting as the rejected Widmark happens to notice Marilyn dancing in the hotel room across the way, directly in front of his. After a brief phone flirtation, the two decide to meet. Initially keeping the fact that she was there babysitting to herself she begins making headway, but when her advances are inconveniently interrupted by the girl she's babysitting, she begins to think the whole world has it there mind to keep them apart. She begins to believe that Widmark's character is the man she lost in 1946 over the pacific (he also happened to be a pilot, which he mentioned to her). Seeming to be to be shaken by all of Marilyn's variations, he realizes he still has feelings for his girlfriend, and it becomes a race to catch her before she is relieved at ten o'clock by another performer. Marilyn however had other ideas, and begins doing everything she can to keep him with her. She grows increasingly frustrated when she is constantly interrupted by the young girl, and her cousin Eddie (Elisha Cook Jr....is it me or does he look like a shorter, stockier version of George W. Bush) Ultimately she loses control of herself, completely breaking with reality.
Many people believe that Marilyn used her past experiences to draw on, when bringing this character to the screen. Usually playing bubbly blondes in much lighter pictures, this is a rare look at the other more visceral and emotional side of Marilyn. When watching this film you'll realize that Marilyn was much more dynamic than most people realized then, or even now.",1056153600,5,2000,4.868035190615836
470255,5,6302439485,"A taut suspenseful little thriller that has no doubt been an inspiration to the countless ""psycho baby-sitter"" films, ""Don't Bother to Knock"" features Marilyn Monroe in a truly terrific performance, playing a truly sad and disturbed character in a truly rare film role. The film benefits from its claustrophobic setting and manages to stay engrossing from start to finish.
Monroe plays Nell, an unstable woman whose uncle, an elevator operator at a posh hotel, manages to get her a one night baby-sitting job, taking care of an eight year old girl. It is evident from the start that Nell is not ""all there,"" but slowly, we get to see just how ""not there"" she really is, and why. Nell WILL NOT let anything stand in the way of her love for a pilot, played by Richard Widmark, no matter what it takes and who she kills.
Deliberately paced, but fascinating and terrifying, ""Don't Bother to Knock"" seems way ahead of its time and brilliantly explores the mind of a true psychotic. This is a wonderful character study in one of the few films Monroe didn't play some dumb blonde trying to marry some attractive millionaire. She fully displays her acting potential and manages to be creepy, sexy,and evil, yet makes you feel for her and long for everything to work out.
This is the film for the true Marilyn fan.",1046736000,10,1305,4.678260869565217
7826250,3,6302439485,WHEN IT CAME OUT IT WAS NOT WELL RECEIVED BY THE CRITICS. HOWEVER I DID NOT THINK IT WAS THAT BAD.,1526428800,,98,3.7142857142857144
7826251,4,6302439485,"Marilyn Monroe is considered an iconic representation of the Hollywood female star. Her looks still inspire millions who adore her. Her breathless dialogue is mimicked to the point it is recognizable. The term glamour is still associated with her. But few look back further than those major performances she left for us to view. Not so with the release of DONT BOTHER TO KNOCK.

This is Monroes first major role, the first film where she had a lead worth noting. She certainly had starring roles in previous films but this was the first to place her center stage in the lead role. Film historians consider her performance here one to back up the claim that she was a talent that deserved more than she received.

Monroe stars as Nell Forbes, a young woman whose uncle Eddie (Elisha Cook Jr.) works as an elevator operator in a posh New York City hotel. Peter and Ruth Jones (Jim Backus and Lurene Tuttle) are in town for him to receive an award at a dinner in the hotel that night and have brought along their young daughter Bunny (Donna Corcoran). Eddie has assured them that Nell is the perfect woman for the job and soon they're introduced and the pair go off to their dinner.

While this is transpiring we also meet Jed Towers (Richard Widmark) and Lyn Lesley (Anne Bancroft). Lyn is a singer in the lounge at the same hotel and has just broken off her relationship with Jed, a man who comes to town periodically but offers her no hope of a future together. Feeling that Jed has no sense of emotion deep inside Lyn tells him her issues and he leaves, going up to his room.

That room is right across the way from the room Nell is in. Looking across the way Jed sees her. Nell has now displayed a different side of herself to us the viewers. She begins by eating chocolates the Jones have left behind. She puts on a nightgown of Ruths as well as stocking and her jewelry. Jed assumes shes in her room and calls her to flirt, eventually getting himself an invite to come over.

This rebound date for Jed turns out to be more than he expected. While things seem to move along smoothly at first he soon learns the truth about Nell. At the same time we begin to learn more about her as well, including the fact that she lost the love of her life and has attempted suicide. The question rises what will she do here in this situation? Is Bunny safe in her care? Will she do harm to Jed?

The movie move along at a steady pace and holds your interest from start to finish. I wasn't sure in reading the synopsis that this would be the case or not. Fortunately it does so and does it well. Even better than that were presented with two main characters that we have no reason to sympathize with, two characters that at first seem to earn our disdain only to learn, as they do, that there is more going on beneath their shells than we expected.

Ive never been a fan of Monroe and honestly this film didn't make me one. Ive always found her breathless way of speaking to be annoying and it can be that way at times here in this film. But she does hold her own and shows a certain amount of allure that would go on to make her a huge success. Widmark by this time had already made his mark as a star. He could have hogged the camera for himself but his performance here shows he was willing to provide an assist to someone new, both in Monroe and Bancrofts performances. Bancrofts role here isn't at the heart of things but she does provide a character that helps to bring out the best in Widmarks.

Twilight Time is releasing the film as they do with all of their titles, in a great looking hi def 1080p presentation and limiting the release to just 3,000 copies. This time around theyve included several great extras to be enjoyed including an isolated music track, a featurette called MARILYN MONROE: THE MORTAL GODDESS, another featurette RICHARD WIDMARK: STRENGTH OF CHARACTERS and the original theatrical trailer. If you're a Monroe or Widmark fan make sure you order this today. With limited copies available they could be gone soon.",1525219200,,4031,4.423180592991914
