8452198,4,B00512GI1C,"Low budget filmmakers, sit up and take notice!  THIS is how you maximize a minimal budget and put out a product that looks like a million bucks.

D4 tells the story of hired mercenaries on a simple search-and-rescue mission in the woods that goes quite askew when they are beset up on by a very big, very angry monster of a man, a product of science run amok.  On the surface, this appears to be a fairly straightforward tale.  However, the filmmakers' choice to tell the story non-sequentially adds layers of ever-deepening mystery and nail-biting suspense to the proceedings.  Just how deep does this conspiracy go?  Well, let's just say, just when I thought I had it all figured out, I was wrong.

Very wrong.

Dickerson manages to elevate D4 miles above its tiny with excellent camera work, a talented ensemble cast, and pulse-pounding action helped out by tight fight choreography and stunts (believe me, I'm a stickler.)

I hope D4 gets the attention that it deserves, because the love and care and attention to detail that was put into it really shine, and it should be held up as .

8452199,2,B00512GI1C,"This low budget movie grabs your attention as there are two bloody individuals sitting outside of a room. One has a knife in her chest. There is a commotion in the room as the woman with the knife in her chest pulls out two hand guns and appears poised to enter the room guns blazing (something I would have done before I got in her condition). After the hook scene we go into a one week earlier flashback which in turn uses more flashbacks as a subplot and to feed us information.

It seems the son of a billionaire widow (Vicki Askew as Vicki Lark) has been taken captive and she employs the mercenary Sloan (Eric Berner) to rescue him. Their initial meeting was a lesson in bad acting and bad dialouge. Sloan assembles a roadhouse team of people we know by nicknames: Smoke (Darrin Dickerson who wrote, directed, and edited this film), Cutter (Jeff Hime) who provides us with some bad tanning bed humor, Brocker (Clay Brocker) apparently the writers couldn't come up with a clever nickname, and Snipe (Jaimee Gray Simon) our token eye candy. Two of these individuals we recall from the opening scene. The son is being held at D-4 which doesn't ""exist"" and is part of the same experimental group in our subplot.

The subplot flashback involves a 6 year old boy being experimented on by horrific MST actors pretending to be doctors. The boy was in the care of his old geezer grandfather (Ted LeGarde), who at times is talking to the doctors and other times is in the woods recording himself on a rescue mission. The editing was as horrific as the script and acting almost to the point of being unintentionally comical. The movie credits read like the Dickerson family tree.

The film has a nice little twist at the end, which shows some writing talent in the basic plot outline. The details in executing the plot were substandard. The script dialouge and acting needed to be more animated. If you are going to have two guys get off a helicopter and walk to swagger music, it needs to be slow motion for the full effect. Who doesn't know that?

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Blood, killing, p-word.",1327190400,,2096,4.566489361702128
8452200,4,B00512GI1C,"I love finding the diamonds in the rough. At a recent Fright Night Film Festival in Louisville, KY, I met the Dickerson brothers and heard about their film. My interest grew stronger when Darrin Dickerson, the director, explained that his conspiracy theory thriller was inspired, in part, by his own son's brush with epilepsy and the scary side effects of the prescription drugs.

""D4"" leads us from the corridors of power in the Pentagon to the woods around an ""abandoned"" government facility, where strange activity has garnered the interest of the local crackpots and big-foot believers. But one grandfather is convinced that his grandson, a sufferer of epilepsy, has been taken to this facility as part of a top-secret experimental program. The grandfather runs across a highly trained paramilitary team, a group of four men and one woman, who have been commissioned by a very wealthy woman to go into D4 and rescue her own son. What they encounter in D4 is frightening, and the final minutes reveal the truth behind the growing conspiracy and a creature known as The Beast. (In the special features, you'll see an explanation of what The Beast actually represents.)

Shot on a very low budget, ""D4"" has the look and sound of a much more expensive film. Dickerson does magic with his editing, cast, and locations to make this a film well worth watching--truly, a diamond in the rough. Rejected by the SyFy Channel, it is far better than most of the films you'll see on that channel. It was rejected for its lack of ""big names,"" which is sad since some of these actors could have long careers in these types of roles.

While some bits of dialogue could've been trimmed by a beat or two, and some of the trudging through the forest could've been tightened, this movie keeps us interested from start to finish as it weaves past and present scenes, drawing us deeper into the truth of D4. And for those who are patient, there is a fun little bookend after the credits that hints at the possibilities of a sequel. I, for one, would line up to see it in a heartbeat. For that matter, I'd trust my own novels in the hands of a director like Darrin Dickerson. This movie deserves a bigger audience, Dickerson deserves a bigger budget the next time around, and thank goodness Netflix has decided to carry this film in their lineup.",1311465600,2,2326,4.696078431372549
