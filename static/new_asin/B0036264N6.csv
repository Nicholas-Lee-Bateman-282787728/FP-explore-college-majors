4072070,4,B0036264N6,"Dinah East is one of those rare cinematic romps that appeals to absolutely everybody; hot-blooded heterosexuals, lusty lesbians, horny homos, titillating transvestites, and even nefarious necrophiliacs!
Written and produced by Gene Nash in 1970, starring renown transvestite, Jeremy Stockwell, and featuring Andy Warhol alumni, Ultra Violet, the film parallels several key aspects of Mae West's career. It is this connection, however tenuous, that makes this long unavailable camp classic so controversial.
Advertisements for Dinah East claim the movie was pulled from distribution after Mae West filed a successful lawsuit stating the film slandered her name, and then proceeded to buy and destroy as many prints of the film she could find.
However, the following facts seem to be at odds with these claims. In 1982, Gene Nash told the LA Times that he had given Mae West and Paul Novak a private screening of the film in 1970. West found the film entertaining and made a few suggestions to ""beef up the dialogue"" which Nash was unable to do, as the filming had wrapped up.
Certainly Variety would have run a story on any Mae West lawsuit. Stanley Musgrove who was her publicist at the time would have brought the topic up with friends, and Kevin Thomas who was a film critic at the LA Times would most likely have known about any such lawsuit as well. Since no word of this was ever brought forth, it is highly possible that West never brought about a lawsuit.
The Mae West overtures aside, Dinah East stands on its own merits. The characters are colourful and engaging, the sets are over the top and the scene set in a gay bar complete with a nude go-go boy in a cage is delightfully wacky. Good humored fun and a sensitive examination of a subject that would have been handled in a tacky way by a less enlightened director.
What is not generally known about Gene Nash is that he had a show business background and worked with Eddy Cantor in his later years, once filling in for him and nobody noticed the difference. Nash also produced, directed as well as  wrote the movie screenplay and all of the songs for the film, What Am I Bid?, featuring the legendary country and western entertainer, Leroy Van Dyke. Other stars who appeared in the film include Al Hirt, Tex Ritter and Faron Young.
My request for information about Gene Nash went unanswered by Paula Stewart, credited as Co-Producer of Dinah East. Stewart, currently  a weekly host on KCLA FM in Los Angeles, is working on a biography of Lucille Ball.
Dinah East is a blast from the past that is still fun and essential viewing for today's jaded sensibilities.",1212192000,10,2623,4.775330396475771

4072072,5,B0036264N6,"The only good thing about the fact that Mae West forced the studio from pulling this movie out of distribution is that now, some 37 years later, we can discover it out of the blue.  What a find!  Fans of ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" will find much to compare in terms of its 70s-style TV-movie score, stilted soap opera acting and bland, fake-looking sets.  The movie is camp when it intends to be and even when it doesn't intend to be.  It's also quite brave for its time since it doesn't pretend to be outrageous as ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"", yet it still offers up plenty of male frontal nudity (gorgeous bods!), heavy lesbian make-out scenes, and even (eww!) a bit of attempted necrophilia. The film also allows the audience to empathize with its leading lady (man, whatever) in her loneliness in being a cross-dressing Hollywood movie star.  Which is to say that this movie is quite watchable and enjoyable on any level.

Tell every camp cinema fan you know about this one but be aware ... the quality of the print of this DVD is awful!  The whole thing is in browns, pinks, blues, and purples.  Hopefully someday they will clean this print up and give it the special edition treatment it deserves.",1181260800,4,1214,4.536697247706422

8389431,4,B0036264N6,"I found this obscure little gem on Fandor and put it in my queue because I thought it would be just another titillating example of exploitation and high camp.  Good for a few laughs after a couple of cocktails.  What I got was something pretty much the opposite of that.  In these days of ""Transparent""  and ""I am Cait,"" we may have lost sight of the fact that general audiences weren't always so accepting of a transgendered character, so the fact that this is a serious and sympathetic portrayal of the life of a female trapped in a male body who chooses to live her truth makes it groundbreaking.  Sure, there's a fair bit of gratuitous nudity, but male full-frontal is given equal time to women's breasts, so while others might view this as lurid and exploitative, I certainly wasn't complaining and couldn't help but see even that aspect of the film as delightfully ahead of its time.

But I digress.

In the film's opening sequence, Dinah East, the eponymous film star, quietly dies in the back seat of her chauffeur driven Rolls Royce.  The cause of her death is never revealed but shortly afterwards it's discovered that she's biologically male.  The press goes nuts and the fall-out for her friends, associates and loved ones is brutal and immediate.  Remember, this is 1970, when homosexuality was still considered a perversion.  So far, you're probably thinking, no surprises.

But the amazing thing about this film is that the majority of it is told in flashbacks from the perspective of the people whose lives were touched by Dinah - the widow of an understanding security guard who allowed Dinah on the studio lot for an audition (despite knowing her secret), the lesbian costume designer she elevated from the ranks and with whom she also shared her true history, a closeted leading man for whom she acted as a beard, her full-time lawyer and part-time escort, her adopted son and her loyal chauffeur.  Every one loves her for her kindness, generosity, empathy and largeness of spirit.  I challenge anyone to walk away from this film and argue that this character was portrayed unsympathetically, or as anything less than a saint, for that matter.

Yes, she dies at the beginning, but this isn't one of those films where the gay character must be given some sort of comeuppance as a Karmic punishment for their transgressions.  Dinah isn't tragic or pitiable.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  Both professionally and romantically, she is hugely successful.  That's right, in addition to film stardom, Dinah finds lasting love.  Remember that loyal chauffeur I mentioned?  Well, he's a former boxer that becomes involved with her and declares his love - knowing full well that she's a girl with ""something extra.""  They remain together until her untimely death.

The film quality is kind of poor and the soundtrack (by Gene Nash, who also wrote and directed) sounds intrusively like a 1970's TV show.  Plus the acting could be better.  Jeremy Stockwell, who plays Dinah, exudes a warm, charming presence but is a bit wooden, particularly in scenes that require big emotion.  The rest of the cast doesn't fair any better, putting in mostly forgettable performances.  On the whole, this reminds me of a Sidney Sheldon paperback, with many scenes tipping over into melodrama.  But then, none of these negatives make this film any different than ""Peyton Place"" or ""The Valley of the Dolls"" and the like, straight films made to appeal to uptight, straight audiences.  The fact that this is an LGBT version of those, makes it pretty groundbreaking.

Ahead of its time in so many ways, ""Dinah East"" really deserves to be seen by more people.",1437868800,2,3646,4.862236628849271
8389432,2,B0036264N6,"Prompted by rave reviews by a few respected bloggers, I shelled out big bucks for a used copy of the 2010 Kit Parker Films remastered release of DINAH EAST.  I should have saved my money. Forgettable and dull, theres a reason most of us Bad Movie aficionados have not even heard of this turkey until recent years.

In one of filmdoms most bizarrely understated death scenes (she apparently expires quietly from a migraine in the back of her limousine), our titular heroine quickly makes headlines after the creepy undertaker discovers her sordid secret: Dinah East Dies: Shes a He!. With a premise ripe for exploitation, the film foolishly tries to take the high road and masquerade as a soapy romance drama/weepie instead of taking advantage of the perfect opportunity for over-the-top Camp. The end result is a movie thats badbut not bad enough to be good.

We never see Dinah in male-mode and only know that she snags an audition at a major movie studio by passing as female which seems to be a decision made on-the-fly simply by donning high heels and a head scarf. The only backstory we get on the character (despite the throwaway line I came out of nowhere) is that she spent her entire childhood in an orphanage. The screenplay never addresses whether Dinah has always had transgender tendencies or simply uses the female disguise to launch a show biz career. As a result, the audience cant connect with the character.

The jumbled narrative doesnt help either, with a series of flashbacks from various characters such as a lesbian costume designer, closeted gay leading man, confused homophobic lawyer and sympathetic fallen prize fighter/love interest recalling how Dinah touched their lives, but nevertheless saying very little about the character.

The 2010 remastered version is cropped and the picture looks rather soft and fuzzy.  The soundtrack could have been ripped from any episode of THAT GIRL. There is lots of male nudity on display from various characters who are surprisingly buff for 1970 male body standards  (especially Matt Bennett as the appropriately-named Tank) but other than that, DINAH EAST is a boring oddity best left forgotten.",1435622400,,2163,5.008356545961003
8389433,5,B0036264N6,"Unusual but very entertaining! I would recommend it to any film buff who has ""discriminating taste"" for the sexually twisted.",1413158400,,125,5.3
8389434,4,B0036264N6,"First, this movie has nothing AT ALL to do with Mae West. It is not even a veiled story of her life, and she did NOT ""force the studio to pull it out of distribution and burn all the copies."" Whoever made up that tale was an idiot. The East/West surname coincidence is ONLY a coincidence. You might as well say that East of Eden is about Mae West as say it about this movie. It's just stupid. This movie owes more to A Star is Born than to anything involving Mae West.

Second, this movie also is not meant to be campy or any of the other dumb adjectives people try to apply to it. Maybe campy people see themselves in it, but that's in THEM, not in the movie.

True: it was made with very little money and with no talent At ALL, anywhere, either before or behind the camera. But it was made with a huge amount of heart, and its sincerity, its openness and generosity of spirit are what make Dinah East well worth watching.

This is a love story about two misfits, and despite all its flaws it is sweet and moving and honest. It's not a joke. Laugh at if you want to, but if you do you're depriving yourself of something a lot better than a good laugh.

But if you do want to watch it, be VERY DILIGENT about which of the two DVD releases you buy. The DVD most earlier reviewers saw is a semi-pirated 2006 release of ABOMINABLE quality in a chopped-off 3:2 full-screen (old TV) format, almost surely copied from a VHS tape released briefly in the 1980s.

It has a rather dull cover, with a photo of Diana East at the bottom and ""A superstar actress is really a man... Hollywood's strangest story! DIANA EAST"" at the top. That is the DVD you DO NOT want to buy. It's nearly unwatchable. Amazon in the US says it's currently unavailable, and let's hope it stays that way. But Amazon in the UK still sells that version; and it is the version the large American DVD-by-mail renter has, so don't bother putting it in your queue.

There is a MUCH better 2010 DVD from Kit Parker Films, distributed in the US by VCI Entertainment and possibly other distributors in other markets. It has remastered video and audio and is in the original 16:9 wide-screen format. It has a more modern, glitzier cover, with ""UN-CUT THEATRICAL VERSION"" in a black banner across the top and ""KIT PARKER FILMS"" in a black banner across the bottom. That is the DVD you MUST buy if you want to see this movie. Amazon sometimes groups the two very different versions (and their reviews) together, so you have to be diligent about buying the right one.",1390608000,,2519,4.337579617834395
8389435,5,B0036264N6,"""Dinah East"" stands at the apex of '70s camp. This flick is based on the ages-old rumor that Mae West was a female impersonator (Mae West, Dinah East, get it?). It is a Warholic must-see due to the presence of one of Andy's superstars: Ultra Violet. If the world is truly due to end during my lifetime, ""Dinah East"" will be one of the movies I will view before my leap into the cosmic abyss. Over and out.",1356134400,2,405,4.205128205128205
8389436,2,B0036264N6,"Dinah East, which simply had to have been shot on an extravagant five dollar budget, doesn't exactly taxi down the runway and take off like a jet. Yes, there are the positives: they filmmakers treat Dinah East with empathy even after we discover that ""she"" was really a ""he;"" and the cinematography was pretty good. The casting isn't bad; and the plot moves along at a good pace. Actually, one big plus is that it's probably a pretty accurate look at what gay nightlife must have been like shortly after the gay liberation movement started in earnest. Unfortunately, however, there are also some major, major drawbacks. The acting is lousy; very little of it was convincing although Matt Bennett does do a good job of playing Dinah's lover and chauffeur Tank Swenson. The scenes are extremely campy and over the top--so much so that you really have to suspend belief to make sense of much of it; this movie makes John Waters' ""Polyester"" look like fine art. (And I did like Polyester, by the way.) In addition, the quality of the print is rather poor; perhaps the original film wasn't well preserved in the first place and I think they just copied this onto DVD from video.

But I think I had better move on to a synopsis that doesn't give away too much; I realize and respect the fact that some people may truly want to watch this and that's fine with me.

When the action starts, we quickly meet an older, reclusive and somewhat faded Hollywood star, Dinah East (Jeremy Stockwell), who goes for a ride in ""her"" Rolls Royce with her chauffeur Tank Swenson after getting a good look at her naked son Jeff (Reid Smith) after he swims in their pool. Unfortunately, Dinah doesn't make it very far; she dies pretty soon right in the car and Tank nearly goes berserk when the ambulance takes her away. Dinah's sudden passing causes grief and stirs up many memories for the people who knew her.

Of course, some memories are good--and some aren't so good. Her lawyer Alan Sloan (Andy Davis) reflects on his relationship with Dinah many years prior, much to the disdain of his son Bobby (Joe Taylor). Jeff East is extremely upset to have lost his mom; and things worsen for Jeff when the parents of his fianc&eacute;e Debbie (Kitty Carl) force Debbie to break off their engagement because Jeff's mom was not a ""she."" A movie studio dressmaker and Dinah's confidant, Daniela (Ultra Violet), mourns Dinah's loss; and Tony Locke (Ray Foster) drowns his sorrows in another beer at the local gay bar.

What happens next? Do people calm down or will more skeletons come out of the closet to make the survivors even more upset? What ever happened when Dinah wanted to financially help the widow of the front gate guard who let Dinah in that first day of work at the studio? Does Alan ever get involved with Dinah? Will Tank stay faithful to Dinah through the years? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!

The DVD does not come with extras--unless you count ""scene selection"" as an extra.

Overall, ""Dinah East"" is not exactly something you should be running down the street to get for your DVD collection. It has its value--but not THAT much value. Again, the acting is lousy; and the plot is somewhat contrived at best. Watching it is something like watching a film that someone shot without too much forethought or spending very much; the sets look like they were bought for $1.99 on the street corner.  Get this if you must; but please be warned you won't be seeing the best film ever made.",1243987200,2,3491,4.630048465266559
