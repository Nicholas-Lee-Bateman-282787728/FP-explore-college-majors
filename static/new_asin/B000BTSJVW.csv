8092595,1,B000BTSJVW,Voice of the Heart was terrible and unexciting. Did not care what happened to characters and they were very forgettable. Act of Will was better but it too dragged and was slow at end. It does not explain what happens with daughter and granddaughter.,1436313600,,249,4.681818181818182
