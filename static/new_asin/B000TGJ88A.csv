2899400,5,B000TGJ88A,"Being a fan of this wonderful show I had my copy of the 4th season on pre-order very early on.  What makes this season so special (and the upcoming final season due out in February 2008 as well) is the long awaited interview with Family Affair star, Johnny Whitaker!

Johnny's interview is like a breath of fresh air!  I'm glad to finally see him included in the series extras.  It's about time!  It's beyond me how you can have one of the two remaining actors on this show doing commentaries and leave the other out completely, especially when the show was mainly about the twins (Buffy & Jody)and the antics they got themselves into.  I can hardly wait to see the remaining piece of Johnny Whitaker's interview!

I agree with another review, that the only thing missing was the list of episodes.  I did, however, find a list of all episodes in order and with their original airing date on imdb.com.  This list was of great use to me when I converted all 4 Seasons over for my ipod!

All in all, the episodes are complete.  The color is good, and I've not had any problems with my discs.  It's wonderful to be able to see this show again as it was my favorite growing up!",1194739200,3,1172,4.375
2899401,5,B000TGJ88A,"I am thrilled that MPI finally decided to include Johnny Whitaker in their extras.  His interview was very well done.  He went over details I had not heard him say in other interviews he has done in the past.  I can't wait for the other half of his interview, which will be included in Season 5's release.  I have had quite a bit of digital tiling on Disc 1.  I don't know if it is a fluke or not.  I don't know if tiling is on the other discs.  It didn't appear on the two separate interviews with Kathy and Johnny on disc 5. I watched the interview portion first.",1194566400,,565,4.081818181818182

Overall, I was happy with the DVD with one exception, it did not include an episode list(that also happened with my season one DVD set) and I had to go online to print a copy of the season 4 episodes. Other than that a great release. Now bring on season 5!",1194480000,4,1266,4.530701754385965
2899403,5,B000TGJ88A,"It's about time ""Family Affair"" was released on DVD, and it's way past time for Brian Keith to be getting his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  That happens next June and details can be found by searching the 'net for ""Star for Brian"".  There's even an auction page on that site with items donated by Brian's widow Victoria and Kathy Garver!  ""Family Affair"" fans, rally 'round!

2899404,5,B000TGJ88A,"Despite a general lack of inventiveness, Season #4 for Don Fedderson & Company's ""Family Affair"" overcomes the usual fourth year fatigue with predictably good performances by Anissa Jones and Johnnie Whitaker as Buffy and Jody Davis, and several good plots for Kathy Garver's Cissy and Sebastian Cabot's French. Brian Keith, his toupee darkened to a cinnamon-brown, is only half-present, though his repartee with the kids is still terrifically warm. Episode 7 finds Buffy nursing a broken leg (for a script apparently whipped up on the spot when Jones broke her leg in real-life). Episode 5 has Jody being wrongly accused of breaking a school window and getting suspended (not Jody!!). Episode 4 has Cissy (temporarily) leaving home. Number 2 sees a visit from Uncle Bill's pal (Dana Andrews) who spent five years in prison! Number 19 has Buffy and Jody coming into a surprise inheritance of $54.00 (which they take to the local toy store--stocked with a heap of now-collectable goodies). And 25 & 26 have the Davises vacationing in Tahiti, where Cissy falls in love with married man Michael Blodgett. Many wonderful memories and laughs in this sensitive, lightly funny '60's gem! Thanks to the website ""Apartment 27A"" for the episode list, which they count as 26 episodes for the season.

2899405,5,B000TGJ88A,"""Family Affair""--like so much of 1960s pop culture--calls us to consider our world not as it is but as it could be.  And ultimately that means reconsidering on some level our own potential as well.

That said, it's becoming faddy with reviewers of old TV shows to find fault with their moral base.  Some even claim that these shows' idealism is psychologically threatening to children who will be frustrated by their parents' inferiority to perfectionistic paragons like ""Uncle Bill"" Davis and Mr. French (or June Cleaver or Carol Brady or Cliff Huxtable...).  But the real threat in the household is more likely parents who don't communicate with their children about life--and who probably haven't followed a piece of down-to-earth advice from ""Family Affair"" -- ""When you're wrong, admit that you're wrong, and you'll be all right.""  A parental apology now and then can help point the kids' moral compass (and their expectations of others and themselves) in the right direction even more effectively than a rerun of ""Family Affair.""  And anyway, assuming these idealistic '60s sitcoms are so terrible for kids, the alternative is--what?--""Desperate Housewives""?

But I digress.

If you liked the first three seasons of ""Family Affair,"" you'll enjoy this one, too.  The twins continue to deal with their own growing pains and the cultural contrasts presented by a world that doesn't always jive with the ideals Uncle Bill and Mr. French provide (for example, they encounter another one of those kids who gets away with murder in ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly?"").  And Cissy plows through teenage growing pains of her own (which include the attentions of a charming young man that she quickly falls for--until she learns he's married).

If you're in the mood for some uplifting, heart-warming nostalgia from the 1960s, ""Family Affair"" is a good bet, in part because it did rather poorly in syndication and wasn't run continuously for the last few decades.  (I can usually predict the plot of an episode of ""The Brady Bunch"" in the first minute or two).  I don't really remember most of the plots from ""Family Affair"" and so there's a certain amount of ""newness"" about it that you might enjoy, too.  It's almost like having a ""new"" '60s sitcom.

Plus, we finally get an interview with Johnny Whitaker (""Jody""), the alumnus who has done the most to milk his association with the show through public appearances and who has been conspicuously absent from special features in the last three seasonal installments.

My only criticism is that MPI Home Video seems able to find only one color photo of the cast, which it continues to run on the cover of each release.  Not a big deal, but odd.",1187654400,20,2681,4.935412026726058
2899406,5,B000TGJ88A,"I get really irritated when people use this review site to make unfavorable comments on t.v.shows. I thought this site was for reviewing the DVD product and its quality, not for giving a rather rudely put opinion of the show itself.  I have to say it; if you don't like the show in the first place, DON'T BUY IT ON DVD, and then proceed to to try to ruin it for everyone else.",1186704000,11,376,4.1506849315068495

It was a boy they met gave them the wrong ideas about his parents let him do what he wanted without permission. The boy was living in a rich society(snob)they call it. You know Uncle Bill wouldn't go for that on letting the twins be out of control without discplinary actions. Uncle Bill was testing them on whereever fun places they wanted to go but not. They wanted to do whatever they pleased. They didn't know on who's the parent & who's the child. Children must do what their parents order them to do whether they like or not. That's why they missed out on fun things they usually do. Later end of the show,Jody & Buffy learned a hard lessons on stop letting kids tell them to do to get out of line. They know Uncle Bill taught them better than that. So they apologized to Uncle Bill,Cissy & Mr. French that they will not disobey again. They love Uncle Bill,Cissy & Mr. French.",1341878400,,1176,5.06701030927835

2899412,5,B000TGJ88A,"Family Affair is wholesome entertainment which in itself is a rarity these days.  Season 4, like the prior 3 seasons, delivers a good message and helps us remember the values of a few decades ago.  I would recommend this series for anyone looking for a ""feel-good"" program, a few laughs, and a program which delivers a moral message.",1282348800,,333,4.724137931034483
2899413,5,B000TGJ88A,"Family Affair, Season 4, is just as wonderful as the previous three seasons!  I haven't yet watched every episode, but I have very much enjoyed the
ones I have watched.  Buffy and Jody are just as adorable as ever (although, a little taller).  Cissy has grown into her prettiness and has become more
sage and sophisticated.  Uncle Bill is still the (mostly) patient ""father figure"".....you can really feel the love he has for the children.  In a recent
interview with Johnny Whitaker (who played Jody), he indicated that Brian Keith (Uncle Bill) had a deep affection for him and the girls in the cast in real life, too, not just as he played his ""uncle"" role.  Mr. French shows his human and vulnerable side more often in episodes of Seasons 3 and 4.  It
makes his character more endearing.  In my personal opinion, Family Affair was one of (if not THE) best shows on television in the 1960's and early 1970's.
Let's face, folks, they (the television industry) just don't make shows like this anymore, sad to say.  Family Affair had it all:  Decency, humor,
intelligent - and compassionate - resolutions to problems, a real sense of family bonding, kindness, and adorable child actors, to boot!  What more could
one ask for in a show?  Oh, yes, there were the ""romantic"" episodes when Uncle Bill comes somewhat close to finding ""Ms. Right!""  Good, clean entertainment
for everyone!  I highly recommend Family Affair, Season 4 (and the other seasons, as well).",1281830400,2,1459,4.784

Tim (Rocky Horror Picture Show/Home Alone 2) Curry was Mr. French in the shortlived 2002 remake which also starred Gary (Brady Bunch movies / TV's Midnight Caller)Cole; which has not been released on DVD at this time.

2899416,5,B000TGJ88A,"Well, what can I say, Superb prints by MPI and a totally enjoyable season. It's good to see the family go to Tahiti in the final two installments of season four.
The extras are VERY IMPORTANT and informative. Where else would you find a discussion of the careers of five former child stars. Kathy Garver of course, always a pleasure to listen to heads the group and producer John Stephens is the moderator. We get to hear interesting stories from Veronica Cartwright, Jerry Mathers, Kym Karath and Pamelyn Ferdin, each tells a fascinating story of their life before and after.
A must for any fan of classic 60s TV.
Of course we get part one of Johnny Whitaker's side of the story, you will have to purchase season five (and why wouldn't you want to collect the entire series?) to see the conclusion.",1206835200,,799,4.594405594405594
