6300396,5,B00IWAF9LU,"I watched the original ""When a Stranger Calls"" back in the 70's. It scared me then and it scares me now! When the remake came out, I really didn't think I'd like it, but my daughter talked me into watching it. To my surprise, I really enjoyed it. It was extremely scary - just in a different way than the original. So buying this double feature gives me the best of both worlds!",1435276800,2,378,4.191780821917808

6300403,4,B00IWAF9LU,"Im a big fan of the original film starring Carol Kane, which is a classic and way better than this new one. However, this one does a fair job of standing on its own. It does start out slow and takes a while for it to pick up steam, but once it does, it doesnt stop until the ending.
  Fan of horror films? May I recommend When A Stranger Calls? You shouldnt be disappointed. I wasnt. Its scary without blood and gore. Whatever you do, don't watch this film alone, at night, in the dark. And if you're a babysitter, you may very well not want to babysit again. I know I wouldnt.",1466380800,,577,4.097345132743363

8645787,5,B00IWAF9LU,My granddaughters and I enjoy this movie. I saw the original at the theater when it first came out.  The original doesn't appear on TV anymore.  I was so pleased when I discovered it on Amazon and had to purchase it immediately.  We're so glad it's a set that has both the original and new version.,1522540800,,298,4.285714285714286
8645788,4,B00IWAF9LU,I am a fan of the original and my teen daughter likes the new one. I like the combo disc packs as it saves space on my shelves for more movies. I still prefer the original and not too fond of the newer film. Did have a great movie night!,1521849600,,237,3.76
