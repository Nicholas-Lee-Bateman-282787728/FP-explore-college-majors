8024259,5,B00029HJPI,"Excellent review of what paleontologists know and wonder about dinosaur eggs and babies. Not for little kids with short attention spans, but very good for a 7 year old with a serious interest in dinosaur science. (And his parent!)",1463011200,,230,4.923076923076923

8024264,3,B00029HJPI,"Reminds me of the old 1970's film rolls. Fuzzy, poor quality. But it is educational so I'll give it 3 stars.",1398211200,2,108,4.190476190476191

8024266,3,B00029HJPI,Repetitious. I dislike programs which keep repeating the intro at the various section starts. Plodding in delivery and could have been more quickly presented.,1382745600,2,158,5.625
8024267,5,B00029HJPI,"Combining insightful interviews and illustrative animation, this fascinating title on the ever-popular subject of dinosaurs is highly enjoyable! A great film for anyone who finds themselves interesting in the behavioral patterns of dinosaurs.",1360022400,,242,6.363636363636363
8024268,4,B00029HJPI,"This is a very good documentary about early dinosaurian developement. Top paleontologists discuss numerous aspects of eggs, egg laying, nests, parenthood and baby dinosaurs themselves. It is comprehensive and detailed for older viewers, yet not too heavy in scientific descriptions for younger viewers. All dinosaurs documentaries are mainly tageted to a younger audience, as is natural. This is no different, but the writing and direction keep it from being a pure kids's show. Computer and stop-motion animation help the audience see dinosaurs as they were. The Computer animation is not as good as it could be because the raptors have full feathery plumage, and the stop-motion is a bit jerky, but not horrendous. It is worth it. What makes this truly worth the price is the interviews with Dr. Robert Bakker. He is incredible.",1135728000,7,830,5.201492537313433
