8400981,5,B003NE8B5G,"If you enjoyed the 1st season You'll love the 2nd season. This is the most random, funny with a sprinkle of drama anime I ever saw. Buy it if you can",1398297600,,149,3.838709677419355
8400982,3,B003NE8B5G,"Spoilers galore. But if you're buying this, you've probably already watched the whole series online by now.

Season 1 was an incredibly amusing story. Even people like me who generally avoid romance can enjoy this. Or perhaps there's just something generally less nauseating about preY2K romance comedies. This is the oldest example I know of trying to hook up a batshit crazy genki girl with a stone cold kuudere. The dub is excelent, but because of the switch from high-energy comedy to pure melodrama, Funimation dumped the series & you'll have to watch episodes 52-102 subbed. The last episode is actually missing from this set & you'll have to watch it online. Despite the total non-ending that the last episode is, it's the last piece of a multipart episode, so not a smart thing to leave out.

Sana is a well-meaning, high spirited girl, yet unwittingly dark & brutal....She absolutely loves doing good deeds & helping others, & even declares herself to be a pacifist when it comes to physical fighting, but indulges in stalking, bullying, blackmail, extortion, & seems to be unaware of just how sadistic she is. She's crazy-strong & is the 2ed scariest person in school. She has a short temper, has manic depressive mood swings, scares her friends & classmates, causes scenes in public at least once daily, & indulges in the occasional punch, kick, & weapon assault; but it's cartoon violence played off for laughs. She's also a hypocrite; she goes out of her way to end Akito's bullying of school students & teacher, & stops his own family from bullying him, but she does it BY bullying him. & even after he's fallen for her, she continues to trash talk him, tease him, & use him as her personal punching bag.

There are of course lots of problems.....There are some random *BLAM episodes that contribute nothing to the stories, lengthy musical filler played ad nauseum in season 2, & recap episodes...That's a lot of filler, not to mention the fact that season 2 has a completely different genre & mood from season 1. There is a cultural goof in the New York arc of season 2, in which there is a female character named Secil. Not only was her name misspelled in english during character intro; it should actually spelled Cecil, which is a boy's name, & a very uncommon one in the United States at that; more common in Europe. The female equivalent is Cecilia. When Naozomi finds out she's his sister, he acts brokenhearted, despite him never showing any kind of romantic affection towards her, so the animators did a poor job of conveying romantic chemistry between them on his side.

There are a couple of story arcs involving another adult Sana gets a crush on that is never brought up again after it happens, including Gojo not even begin brought up when Sana's infatuation with older men is discussed. Also the subplot of the Kurata family hotsprings is only brought up again once & left unresolved. Akito seems to be a minor character in the anime, as of half way through season 1, with Naozumi arguably having way more screen time. There's a metric ton of misunderstandings, unspoken feelings, & putting other people's happiness before their own that westerners like me frown upon as weakness & contrived. Sana & Akito are also a prime example of The Precarious Couple Effect & no matter how much they keep telling themselves that they like eachother, I'm just not seeing the chemistry between them.

The effort they put into showing how compatible Sana & Akito are with other people was just more convincing while their desire to return to their first loves, like a hoarder unable to throw away garbage because it holds nostalgic sentiment. The coincidentally timed breakups with their new sweethearts is horribly contrived & everyone seems more interested in the happiness of the protagonists than with themselves, in fact their thoughts seem to revolve around either Akito or Sana like they had no lives of their own, not to mention that none of these characters act their age but think more like people in their late teens.

Speaking of awkward chemistry, we also have Rei & Asako. I'd like to point out that Asako has minimal character development & not much personality. Despite being a nice guy with good intentions, Rei's an indecisive two-timer. After breaking up with Sana to date his ex girlfriend, & Sana started treating him like Zenjiro 2.0 because of it, Rei immediately turned around & became Sana's dedicated buttmonkey fanboy. His dreams & goals involve having both women in his life forever, unwilling to chose one over the other. When Asako dumps him for always putting Sana before her & forgetting his promise to move to London with her, he manages to sweet talk her into waiting for him & keeping a long distance relationship. Despite this, he drools over the girl who works at Grandma Kurata's sauna & Misako's ex husband's fiance.

After the storyline stopped focusing on akward breakups based on stupid misunderstandings between Fuka & her crush, or Naozumi's sleezy & obnoxious new manager sabotaging the chemistry (& he disappears from the show entirely after this), Akito goes back to being absent from the show in a good deal of episodes, failing to show the audience exactly why he & Sana have any real chemistry with eachother. When he does show up after the breakup, their relationship is merely friendly, or he will find himself dragged into situations against his will or will be tagging along & not really contributing to the plot of the episode in any way.

The relationship between Sana & Akito does not progress from this point. The anime series ends with a teacher trying to get Akito expelled (think Yu Yu Hakusho) & Akito & Sana almost dying trying to prevent a new friend from committing suicide. Before closing, Akito steals a kiss & Sana punches him. They tell eachother that they'll tell eachother their feelings ""next time."" Aside from the fact that they've told eachother their feelings many times only to act no different the next day, there is no next time. The Deep Clear one-shot manga was not adapted into animation & the anime diverts heavily from the manga, so the anime has an unresolved ending.",1393459200,,6166,4.810377358490566
8400983,1,B003NE8B5G,There's a guaranteed way to disappoint a customer and that is to release a product before it is finished. The last bunch of episodes were not put on DVD. If you don't believe me you can check on Wikipedia and see. I can only wish you luck on trying to find them on YouTube.,1392336000,,273,4.074074074074074

it arrived on time and in good condition and a good price
recommend this to any kodomo no omocha fan",1383350400,,171,3.7777777777777777
8400985,5,B003NE8B5G,"I love Kodocha, it's hilarious to me, the characters are cute and it's full of energy. I watch it in English, the Japanese is good but Sana's voice is kind of irritating. That said, the series in any language has been said to be 'a high form of torture' by one of my guy friends, which is also funny. Other friends like the series, Sana's rapping annoys some people but I just think it's funny.
I enjoyed season 1 more than season 2, but if you liked season 1 you'll probably enjoy watching the next set.

This is episodes 25-51, called Season 2 here but it's not really (it's complicated). Ep. 1-51 only cover half the anime series, unfortunately Funimation doesn't seem like it's planning to license and release the rest of the series, so you will need to track down the Japanese version somewhere to watch the rest.

The manga is only 10 volumes, so you must know the anime has a lot of filler plots, but I found the anime different enough from the manga that they are both entertaining. (It should be easier to obtain the manga if you want to finish the story... but the manga is out of print. The world is out to get us.)

Note that this set is the S.A.V.E edition, I've uploaded a customer picture so you can see what it looks like. It's a single hardshell case with the 7 discs inside, seems decent quality. Definitely not as pretty as the slim-case boxed set, but that's S.A.V.E. for you.",1330992000,,1396,4.382239382239383
8400986,5,B003NE8B5G,"this is not the second season this is only episode 24-51 T,T even though this show is really awesome i wish they dubbed the real season 2 (episode 51-102)
:(  gaaaaaaaaaaaaah Dx akito just sounds so weird in Japanese D:",1296864000,3,219,4.475
8400987,5,B003NE8B5G,"Kodocha is one of those series' that warms your heart and nearly makes you pee your pants laughing. It is very random at times and very very energetic. while being upbeat it also has a serious atmosphere at times. Overall it is about sana a child star and her relationships with family,co-actors,friends and love interests. However with Sana around life is anything but dull, if you like typical school day dramas with added comedy,love triangles and pure randomness than Kodocha is just what your looking for.",1285200000,,510,4.941860465116279
8400988,4,B003NE8B5G,"The full series is 102 episodes, Funimation only released the first 51 before dropping the series. They keep releasing the first half in cheaper and cheaper sets (this set is about the same price as one DVD in the original release). The show is a lot of fun as the other reviews say, and it's a great price, but you can only buy half of the series.",1280102400,2,348,4.208955223880597
