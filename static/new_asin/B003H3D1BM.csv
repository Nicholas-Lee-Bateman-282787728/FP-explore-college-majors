If you can't buy the finest coaching time, the best rack, the best gym membership then buy this series!  With any number of implements to approximate the equipment used the fundamental concepts are gold. Tactical training isn't supposed to make you look like a monster just move like a superhuman, this is put together that just watching what Coach Sonnon has put on-line for free would give you years of training combinations.  I found this adaptable in so many ways that I have to come back to this particular one and the other two every few months.

  I will admit, I have purchased many of Sonnon's programs and I find his methods great. My mentor is a medical doctor and OMD a title rarely used any longer since Cert. Acupuncturist came into licensure, anyway as someone that likes clinical language and thinking plus how to train anyone to become a Spartan....I like, and once you are done, gift it, win-win.

There are bodyweight exercices, with clubbells, kettlebells, medicine ball. It's rich, efficient and challenging!",1299456000,4,287,5.857142857142857

Let me start by saying that although I like to think I'm in decent shape, I'm no fighter. I'm just trying to find new ways to get myself in shape. My roommate actually turned me on to the Ultimate Conditioning DVDs (Strikers, Ground Fighters, and Kickers) because he's pretty into the whole martial arts scene. Thankfully he did because this is one of the greatest exercise regimens I've ever put myself through.

The DVD is set up into ""levels"" and ""stations."" Basically, the idea is you practice at the lowest level in the four different stations until you get the hang of it and then move up to the next levels. But it's not that easy. In order to test your endurance, there's a ""circuit"" to test how well your practicing has gone. You will go through 8 rounds of 20 second of work and 10 seconds of rest. You do this a total of 4 times (for each station) with a minute of rest in between. It's pretty brutal but a lot of fun (if you enjoy testing your limits, that is).

For each practice session, I recommend watching the video first before you start. Some of the exercise are complicated and the higher levels require both mental and physical conditioning. The last exercise in the Kickers DVD, for instance, builds upon itself step by step with each level. Another bit of advice is to listen to everything Scott says. Don't move too fast up the levels if you're not ready and practice your technique before you try the circuit out. You want to spend at least a day or three just practicing one set of exercises. Also, if you're like me and not training for a fight, you may want to use minimal or no weight to start off. On some exercises, I just hold a tennis ball in my hands just so I can practice the movements of the technique without killing myself trying to heft a clubbell or kettlebell around.

One would think the Strikers DVD focuses on upper body or that the Kickers DVD focuses on just the legs, but this would be a big mistake. Virtually every exercise has left my body aching in several different places around my body. By the time I finish a ""station,"" I'm a beautiful wreck. And after I spent a couple months with this routine, I'm starting to feel like I'm coming out of the wreckage completely enhanced and toned from head to toe.

Highly Recommended",1277942400,5,2551,4.407643312101911
