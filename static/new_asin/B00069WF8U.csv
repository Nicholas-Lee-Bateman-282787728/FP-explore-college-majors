2179500,1,B00069WF8U,I have ordered from Zoverstocks before and I had no problem with getting region 1 dvds. Now I'm getting region 2 from Zoverstocks?? Come on.,1409875200,,140,4.64
2179501,5,B00069WF8U,It was fun to watch Martin Clunes in a comedy as a young man.  I always watch him in Doc Martin and love his work.,1402185600,,114,3.56
2179502,3,B00069WF8U,not so great.  not very likeable characters.  They came accross as very shallow and not quite comfortable with the slobs they were portraying.,1379721600,,142,5.130434782608695
2179503,1,B00069WF8U,I ordered this with high expectations and anticipation because I love Marin Clunes! Our DVD player would not play the show and kept spitting the DVD out! Disappointed! The seller should have been more specific with details!,1349827200,,223,5.054054054054054
2179504,1,B00069WF8U,"I love Martin Clunes in Doc Martin and other things.

This? Talk about mean-spirited, angry, hostile, irresponsible people.
Sorry, most of the ways the characters treated each other were simply not funny to me.

A woman who is always insulting her boyfriend - why is she still with him?
A man who visibly prefers other women to his girlfriend. Surely, he could find someone else, instead of treating her with such disdain.
Each character is more annoying than the last.

I suppose, if you're 16 this is cute and bold.
But beyond that?",1342051200,,534,4.720430107526882
2179505,4,B00069WF8U,considering I tend to like the british comedies from the 70s and 80s more than anything else --- this comedy is rather good.  it takes place in the 90s and brings a different sense of british comedy to the screen --- a bit more in tune with the times.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys british humor.,1272499200,,311,4.254237288135593
2179506,3,B00069WF8U,Harry Enfield doesn't really click in this. ITV made the right choice in essentially rebooting the show with Neil Morrissey. It's still pretty funny though but really you are better off starting with series 2.,1138924800,,209,5.0
2179507,5,B00069WF8U,"If you like British humour you really need to give this one a go.  It is about a couple of guys sharing a flat and being guys.  In other words drinking too much, trying ineptly to get off with women, talking bullocks and generally never growing up.  Oh yes it is also about the relationship between Gary and Dorothy who stay together because....well it's hard to say really.  I'm a big fan of Python, Black Adder, Red Dwarf and Bottom.  If you're like me (deranged) then you'll probably love this series.",1072483200,,504,4.4945054945054945
8040736,3,B00069WF8U,"My first exposure to this series.  Pretty funny, but not as much as I'd anticipated.",1503964800,,84,4.6
8040737,1,B00069WF8U,Crude characters. I bought because I like Martin Clunes.,1499040000,,56,5.333333333333333
8040738,1,B00069WF8U,British version with Martin  Clunes so much  better than. American version.,1489104000,,75,5.7272727272727275
8040739,1,B00069WF8U,Really unfunny,1480464000,,14,6.5
8040740,5,B00069WF8U,This show was ahead of its time,1469318400,,31,3.5714285714285716
8040741,3,B00069WF8U,We love Martin Clunes and that is why we ordered this DVD. The stories are rather simple and stupid though and not up to his normal shows. I think it must have been early in his career.,1467417600,,185,4.027027027027027
8040742,5,B00069WF8U,Love Martin Clunes.  he is a very gifted comedienne,1464048000,,51,4.666666666666667
8040743,2,B00069WF8U,A disappointment.  The jokes are not truly funny.,1463529600,,49,5.125
8040744,5,B00069WF8U,"If you like Martin Clunes, who plays Doc Martin, you may enjoy this series.  Later seasons of Men Behaving Badly, in my opinion, are even funnier. Basically it is about two men whose behavior ticks off their female neighbor and the character Gary's girlfriend.",1446249600,,260,4.909090909090909
8040745,5,B00069WF8U,Another great BritCom!,1445644800,,22,6.666666666666667
