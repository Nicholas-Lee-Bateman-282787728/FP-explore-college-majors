8321600,5,B001MS7JEO,there's a ton of nudity and a few sexual scenes that show some good action.  I enjoyed the nudity.  I couldn't make heads or tails from the plot as there are no words.  I never studied the old tale that they refer to so I couldn't tell you how accurate it is.  I can say there is good skin.,1296000000,,290,3.864406779661017
8321601,3,B001MS7JEO,"Filmed in the style of the silent film era in black and white with piano accompaniment, this 27 minute art house flick told me little about Sappho  The intertitles (the panels of written narration that are supposed to illuminate the filmed sequences)  do not provide dialog but attempt to narrate the story with excerpts from the poetry of Sappho. Granted it's less than half an hour long (including previews), but you can learn more about Sappho from Wikipedia than from this film.

The title Anatomia is derived from the use of anatomic sketches that occasionally flash up on the screen during a scene. These anatomic flash cards are relevant to the action and interaction between characters (female genitalia, breast anatomy, male genitalia et cetera) and are not erotic but clinical. Perhaps they are intended to imply that actions are largely driven by some imperative that a person's anatomy brings with it. I'm not sure, but maybe you can figure it out.

The nudity (male and female) and romantic scenes (lesbian and heterosexual) are tastefully and artfully shot and are not explicit.",1247875200,3,1092,5.016574585635359
