8463527,3,B005APLC16,"I wanted to love this documentary.  But, I just felt that it was poorly edited.  Nothing seemed to really flow, and properly unfold.  The only two characters who had definite storylines were Elmo and Catwoman.  But, Catwoman's was only bought together after seeing the additional footage.",1337212800,,288,5.195652173913044
8463528,5,B005APLC16,"Absolutely LOVED this unbiased documentary, which has faithfully told the story of Hollywood's controversial buskers/costumed characters. The unexpected appearance of Stan Lee (and what one of my favorite comic creators EVER had to say on the subject) = icing on the cake! FOX NEWS: take some notes from Gips + Hunt please.",1318204800,,323,5.230769230769231
8463529,5,B005APLC16,"A fascinating look at the world of people who dress as movie/television characters and work along Hollywood Boulevard posing for photos for tips. You feel sorry for some of the people, you feel empathy for some of the people, and some of them are downright scary. Nice humor, nice filming, and a nice look at a segment of Hollywood that most people are not aware of.",1318032000,,366,4.5606060606060606
8463530,5,B005APLC16,"Archie Gips and Matthew Hunt have created a highly enjoyable look at the costume characters on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. Always maintaining an objective eye, the film offers no commentary on the lives of those examined, but manages to take an in-depth look into the public and private moments of an eccentric, eclectic and fascinating subculture.

Much, much better than ""Confessions of a Superhero""!",1317600000,,400,5.25
8463531,5,B005APLC16,"Go see this Doc! If you've been down hollywood blvd and seen these people working the street, im sure you
have an opinion on them. This film follows these people and you get to know why they are out there doing what
they do. Not what i was expecting, really funny and interesting. Very entertaining and eye opening documentary.",1317168000,2,327,4.559322033898305
