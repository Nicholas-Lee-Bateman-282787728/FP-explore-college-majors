1637411,4,B00005NTOE,"My kids love Tom & Jerry. Who couldn't? (I'll never forget, when I was 18, I was on a plane headed from Denmark to LA and the overhead played Tom & Jerry cartoons- the old one's from the 60's. Every adult was laughing their heads off! Adults laughing...at a cartoon!)The Magic Ring has all the chases and 'cartoon violence' as the old ones did including a lot of other characters that have been forgotten, like Droopy!
Love this film as much as my kids. It has great humor and Tom & Jerry are still chasing each other, even if they have to save each other now and then!",1218153600,3,569,4.277777777777778

1637417,3,B00005NTOE,"I give this movie only 3 stars, i know coming from me that might seem a bit drastic if you've read my reviews before, the overall plot of the movie was simple enough: Tom trying to get a ring off of Jerry's head, which is stuck. It belongs to what looks to be an amateur wizard without a face {in other words, Tom's master!!}. The movie isn't long, only an hour and 2 minutes. There's a lot of facial exaggerations as a tribute to Tex Avery...you know, eyes popping out of heads and tongues flapping a mile a minute and being pulled all over the place, etc. Tom and Jerry in this film still do not speak, unless you count the laughter out-bursts and the screams whenever there's trouble on the horizon. The funniest segments are when their famed co-stars pop in the movie: Droopy is a bus driver and later a fortune teller. Spike, the Irish dog, is still hilarious and it's him who you'll all laugh at! A black cat is also on hand...he sounds a bit like Mr. Jinx {Marlon Brando-ish if you don't know who Jinx is}. Then the other Spike, and his son, Tyke, make appearances. The little gray mouse who in the MGM theatricals spoke French, appears, but this time the mouse talks like a baby...it's a good little movie and there's plenty of humorous slap-stick violence...but it could have been a lot better.",1087084800,,1303,4.433333333333334
1637418,1,B00005NTOE,"This disapointing movie misses completely the spirit of the ""good old Tom & Jerry"" cartoons. The plot gets boring very soon, and the movie is too long and neither fun nor funny (there's a difference). It just feels like a cheap imitation of the original T&J toons. Simply lame. Go with ""Greatest Chases"".",1081814400,4,304,4.754716981132075
1637449,3,B00005NTOE,I loved this movie as a kid and its still good. Just not as good as before. The drawing style is interesting but even as a youngster i realized they were not drawn in the original style. There are a few good laughs in this film and some clever gags. Frank welker drastically overdoes his vocals for Jerry but the rest of the voice actors do admirably. Jeff bennett does a good tom and a spot on droopy. The voice of spike from droopy is also exact. This film never gets boring at only 62 minutes long. A worthy view but frank should have done better considering his restraint and uniqueness as jerry in the filmation tom and jerry shorts. The only better tom and jerry film is the fast and furry.magic ring is enjoyable just don't expect it to be like the original shorts.,1466726400,,772,4.3310344827586205

I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 4 year old son. We love Tom & Jerry in this house and I cannot wait to watch and enjoy this one with him! If a problem occurs I will update the review but anticipate nothing of the sorts. One thing I will add (I already anticipated this because I frequently purchase Tom & Jerry DVD's)do not expect this to be an hour-hour and a half DVD... It only contains a few episodes! But worth the price!",1353628800,,573,4.125
1637476,1,B00005NTOE,"The local video store lets you rent kids movies for free, and since my son loves the classic Tom and Jerry cartoons we picked this up.  It is so very bad!  The story is not developed with any kind of narrative flow.  Instead, Tom happens to live in a house with a weird guy working on magic experiments in the basement and he leaves Tom to guard a magic ring.  That's it for plot.  Tom and Jerry fight over the ring in a series of different set locations and hilarity - scratch that, lameness - ensues.  Bland art & animation, complete lack of plot development, and utter lack of any charm make this one a real stinker.  It was a free rental and I still felt ripped off!  The ghosts of the old Tom & Jerry critters must be rolling over in their pet cemetery graves with schlock like this getting released.",1261267200,,805,4.25
1637477,3,B00005NTOE,besides its Tom and Jerry-I think Id forgotten how much bashing goes on-its more for the older kids because its still fun and funny classics just my mistake thinking itd be appropriate for a 3yr old boy. Glad I watch stuff before I give it to him to see or Id be getting anvils dropped on my head or something-lol.,1258329600,3,314,4.25
1637478,1,B00005NTOE,I hate this DVD!  It's nothing like the classic cartoons.  My kids love Ton & JHerry and they won't have anything to do with this.  They aren't even old enough to really appreciate the difference between the classic cartoons and the more modern versions.  It's ludicrous that they even tried to pull this off.  I hate it!,1231804800,,321,4.56140350877193
