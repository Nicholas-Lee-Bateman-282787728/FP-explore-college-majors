8503724,2,B006S6L86U,"Okay so the boxset I purchased is only season one and two. There are three seasons in all. You can not buy season three on its own unless you get it on demand so I would advise to get the complete series it is more expensive but at least you can see all the episodes.

As the titled says the series is very good it's super funny and informative. BUT the actual boxset I purchased from amazon was used but said to be in very good condition this WAS NOT TRUE!! Three of the five disc of season one skipped and skipped so bad I could not watch most of the episodes on those discs.

So I had a very mixed experience but overall I wish I had of waited and spent a bit more and got the complete series.",1357516800,,696,3.9642857142857144
