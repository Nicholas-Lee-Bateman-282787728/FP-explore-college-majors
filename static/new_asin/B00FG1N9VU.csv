5990870,5,B00FG1N9VU,"Great documentary about football's first family. Loved the home video and high school footage I had never seen before along with the coverage of the 'other' Manning brother that never gets talked about.

I wish it would have been longer and I can't wait for the future SEC films.",1386028800,4,279,4.6938775510204085
5990871,5,B00FG1N9VU,"The Family Unit is what makes any society strong and enduring ( duh! ); sooo, the very inspiring story of the Football Manning's , from babies on up , as an American Success Story , should be viewed by as many folks as possible.",1385683200,5,228,4.204545454545454

5990877,5,B00FG1N9VU,"I saw this on ESPN  and was thrilled to get my own copy to watch anytime.
I have been a fan of Peyton since his Tennessee days and have followed him through his career.
Hated to see him retire but he deserves it and CONGRATS on all his accomplishments.",1458518400,,252,4.142857142857143
5990878,4,B00FG1N9VU,"The Manning family is acknowleged as football royalty, and I was fortunate to have been around to watch Archie Manning's talent, which unfortunately was squandered on a team that didn't deserve him.  He was rewarded, however, with two sons who ascended to the highest ranks of football success, winning multiple Super Bowls, and securing their fortunes (and perhaps his, too) while never forgetting that family is more important than glory, or fame, or fortune in the end.  We enjoyed the film and were only disappointed that it was short, when there was so much more of the Manning story that could have been told.  Well worth watching for those who remember Archie in his heyday.",1458345600,,681,4.904347826086957
5990879,5,B00FG1N9VU,"If you are a fan of the Manning Family, you will enjoy this video.  We first saw it on ESPN, it is a biography that starts with Archie Manning as a boy and continues through his football career in college and later in the NFL.  So cute to see a 2 year old Peyton Manning setting up for his throw, he was born to be a football star.  Very enjoyable for all ages.",1458172800,,361,3.9178082191780823

5990898,5,B00FG1N9VU,"If you don't already love Archie Manning, you will.  Being from Mississippi,  I've known who he was and of course his children, but this shows what a fantastic parent he is, there are tons of home video that made me laugh, cry and be amazed at what an amazing man and athlete he is, several times my husband said "" I didn't know that,"" so it's not the same old dvd profiling a sports legend. I found it not only entertaining but inspirational. .it would be a great gift for a new dad, as this shows how much he loved his boys and only wanted to be a great dad.",1436400000,,560,4.081818181818182

5990902,5,B00FG1N9VU,"Informative documentary about football's first family, the Mannings. Father Archie was quarterback at Ole Miss and then at the newly formed New Orleans Saints in the NFL. He was beloved in New Orleans but never achieved NFL greatness. His three sons Cooper, Peyton, and Eli, all played football. Cooper suffered a serious neck injury and had to leave the sport. Peyton and Eli are both NFL stars and Super Bowl MVPs. The documentary includes home movies of the boys playing in the Manning yard as children, revealing Peyton's early serious regard for the game. As a New Orleans native who remembers Archie playing at Ole Miss, then for the Saints, and also when his sons were small, I found this DVD highly enjoyable.",1433721600,,717,4.837398373983739

5990904,5,B00FG1N9VU,This ESPN doc shows how footballs most successful family made it and the price to be great. it arrived very fast and its one of the best documentaries about a family who loves each other and a little football in the background.,1432944000,,227,4.428571428571429
5990905,5,B00FG1N9VU,"Although I have not opened as yet; it was the BEST Documentary that I have seen in a long
time.  No wonder those boys are what they are; gentlemen; loving and great athletes.
Archie is a great father and teacher of the sport; I bought it for myself and my sons.
Play it again for FATHER's Day for Archie goes down as one of the finest.
I have watched those young men play for their time in the NFL but having this wonderful"" Book of
Manning"" showed so many college days of the guys in college; they were unbelievable.  But I especially enjoyed watching Archie play in college and then in the NFL; I have NEVER SEEN any
Quaterback run one way then the other to tire the opponents and then he would make an unbelievable pass for usually a touchdown,  AND MORE AMAZING than that; he could still perform
The exact way when he returned for his Home Coming Game with his old teammates.  WHO DOES THAT!?  No one; these guys ( not all) unfortunately get caught up in the limelight, money
and then some cannot sustain their positions.  I feel blessed to have been able to see more about this wonderful family;  my most sincere gratitude for the effort that went into this documentary.  Of
coarse, you had great material in which to start.

My football nut husband always said Archie Manning was the best quarterback ever to play on a pretty bad team, so  I wanted to learn a little more about him.  I had heard he said that his kids were doing well where they were and he never wanted to uproot his family, thus passing on better opportunities.  I believe that now after watching the DVD, and that he really felt family always came first.",1423958400,,534,4.363636363636363
