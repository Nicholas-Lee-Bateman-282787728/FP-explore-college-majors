1419990,3,B00005B24M,"Okay, so this is not the best horror film out there. And so what if it copies the premise of the last Nightmare On Elm Street movie. The story is entertaining enough, the acting is okay, believe me there is much worse out there, and the production seems well done. Molly Ringwald is her usual self, the rest of the cast fits the movie. The gore is decent and overall it is not a bad film to rent with another movie to balance it out. Most horror movie fans will enjoy this I think, it is not great but certainly worth the time to watch it.",992217600,3,539,4.09433962264151
1419991,4,B00005B24M,"The plot: A group of film students decide to film a ""cursed"" horror film, but all of a sudden, they begin to get murdered by a masked killer, one by one. Sound familiar? Yep, it's bone done similarly in Urban Legends : The Final Cut and Scream 3. But Cut managed to pull the plot off exceptionally well. And sometimes, with more suspense. That's what this movie is full of. Suspense. There will be times when it seems as if the killer will pop out of nowhere, but he calmly walks onto the scene. That was one of the awesome things about Cut. Another is the killer itself. The mask is a bit creepy, and he's not afraid to use anything in hand to murder his victims. Although it seems like fire was his favorite. Another formula that was used in this movie was that they combined the slasher movie technique with the evil spirit technique. The two were combined, and didn't slow the movie down one bit. The cast of characters were awesome, but stereotyped. You had the joker, the tough one, the slut, the sweet one, the innocent one, and the one you think is the killer but turns out not be. And then there is the one person who graced this film. Molly Ringwald. After seeing her in all of those 80s teen romantic comedies, I was surprised at how well she did in the horror genre. All in all, it isn't as good as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, but is much better than I Still Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend.",991440000,13,1433,4.252747252747253
1419992,4,B00005B24M,"This isn't a good movie..... It's GREAT!  This movie is from Australia and is similar to our Halloween movies in many ways.  The acting is as good as most dead teenager type horror movies of the past years and the FX's are good.  The mad killer is called `The Scarman' and he is creepy in the Michael Myers vein.  It pulls no punches in its killings and moves along like most horror movies of the 80's and 90's.  The gore factor is high.  The killer picks off is victims in novel ways.  This guy could have the type of horror movie cult following that Michael, Freddie or Jason have here in the states but this movie seems to be a threat to those franchises.  It is being released directly to video/DVD here after being released theatrically last year in Australia.  There is even a sequel in the works and we all know that sequels are only made if there is money to be made.  Overall it would be a good date movie, the scares are there.  Also the potential for the `Scarman' to become a Halloween costume favorite is very favorable.",990403200,12,1033,4.356020942408377
1419993,4,B00005B24M,"as an aussie, i truely recommend you check out CUT, it is one of the first movies in its genre that has been made in over 10 years in Australia. I attended the world premier in Sydney i was in the the 5th row and Molly Ringwold was standing only 10 feet away form my seat. Anyway back to the film, i think it holds up to nearly anything that Hollywood can make, it borrows such great horror scenerios and themes that blend in from the ""Elm St."" series, and and all the Jason movies. On a highg note it is better than most american horror. Its a pity you americans are only now getting to see this film as it was released in Australia in March 2000, but really didn't make the cut with the aussie audience as as we are always brainwashed by american horror such a s the ""scream"" series. So don't be afraid to check out this little aussie gem with a little american flare.",989280000,6,870,4.153846153846154
1419994,5,B00005B24M,"In 1985 a movie called Hot Blooded was being filmed but when the director is murdered by one of the actors the preduction closes down.  12 year later a group of film students hear about the movie and deside they want to finish it for their project. They hear a curse that surrounds the movie that basicly when ever someone has tried to finish it before, they end up dead. Not listining they track down the movies original star who was also attacked by the killer on set but turned the tables on him and killed him. She doesn't want to go back to set but does anyway. As soon as the students start filming they start to dissapear in gory fasion, it seems the killer is back.  Cut is a truly great movie that deserves to be up there with Scream instead of going straight to video everywhere. It's probably one of the only Australian slasher films out there and like most Aussie horror there is buckets of blood. The charicter development could of been alot better, most of them I couldn't even remeber there names. The killer is cool, I loved when you found out who he was in the ending a bit of a surprise. His weapon was wierd it was a modified pair of ardin shears, I loved the line ""it's not a knife officer, just a pair of gardin shears, slightly modified so I can do interesting things with it, like chop heads off"". Another cool thing was that this starred 80s teen queen Molly Ringwald as one of the leads. Cut also has some humor to it and most of it works, to even it out there are some chilling scenes and gruesome kills. Cut is cool, rent it.",989107200,6,1552,4.257627118644068
1420033,3,B00005B24M,"Being Australian I can tell you honestly that I really do not like most of the films made here. Especially when it comes to attempts at horror films.

This was on TV tonight, and I was ready to put a DVD on, when this started airing and said it was a horror movie. I figured it might be OK so I started to watch it. I rolled my eyes and reached for the remote when I saw it was an Australian made film.

However, I thought the blond on screen looked pretty cute, and was watching it for the first few minutes for reasons other then caring what the movie was about. Then Kylie Minogoue shows up on screen and I nearly barfed every where. I was about to turn it off and start watching something else, when all of a sudden Kylie's character is killed. And it brought a smile to my face, so I figured I would give this movie the benefit of the doubt and watch it a bit more, cause there would be no more damn Kylie in the film.

By the time the thing was finished, I thought, there where things I did not like in the movie, but overall, I thought it was OK, and beleive me, I don't give generous reviews to a lot of Australian movies cause of the absolute garbage they produce here and get praised for it like it's a masterpiece of independent film making that shows Australia can produce terrific films, but always seem to have stereo type accents, a tin shed and muscle car out in the middle of no where.

The plot to this movie is 12 years ago from the date this was supposed to be set, a film was being made called Blood Shed or something. The director is killed (Kylie, YEAH, YEAH, SLASH HER) and the film is never finished.

12 years later, the daughter and her friends from film school buy the rights to finish the film. Only to discover the curse is true, and the killer is back.

In all honesty, it kept me watching, but I did not like the main killer guy being so much of a rip off of Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers combined, however, they did have a pretty good and simple look for him that I think works well... however, if they where going for the rip off of Jason and Michael, they should have kept this killers mouth shut. When he speaks, it just does not seem right, his accent should be that of a demon or something evil if he is going to speak, not sound like someone auditioning for play school.

I had to laugh when I saw Stephen Curry in this, I killed myself laughing when he was on screen trying to look serious, and all I could do was laugh and say, ""He's in a horror movie, bwuahahahahaha"" cough, anyway..It was one of those movies that really did get better by the ending, and in the final scenes, I even forgot I was watching an Aussie movie and was just into the action of it all. Just too bad whats-her-face didn't get taken out by the B-Grade poop head when he douses her in gasoline. She became more annoying as the film went on, and ya really wanna see her killed off, but oh well, at least Kylie was killed early enough in the film for me to keep watching, cause if she was in any more of the film i'd have turned the whole thing off in disgust, so thumbs up for showing our fantasies on film :D",1213920000,,3126,4.131578947368421
1420034,1,B00005B24M,Before I rented this movie I knew it wasn't going to be anything special. I was however expecting this film to be at least watchable. This is without a doubt one of the worst pieces of garbage I have ever seen in my entire life. Again like usuall cheap teen slashers its the same thing all over again(the thing was this was even worse). A killer stalks actors of a low budget horror film. While they make this film each of the actors are killed one by one. I have never seen such bad acting before. But the thing that really got on my nerves about this film is the actual story. The film the actors are making is cursed? And then it leads to the most rediculous ending I had ever seen showing nothing but stupidity. I was thinking that this had to be a joke. But this didn't even make me laugh. This is the one film that shows to us just how BAD a movie can actually get.,1143072000,,871,4.099415204678363
1420035,2,B00005B24M,"For Kylie Minogue fans, I just want point out that she is only in two scenes at the beginning of the film. CUT features one of the dreaded downfalls of many a slasher film: characters you want to see die within the first ten minutes. Raffy and Hester are two obnoxious and pushy film students who want to take up the task of finishing a supposedly cursed horror film called HOT BLOODED which was cut short (no pun intended) due to the murder of the director of said film. Alas, as though we did not expect it, the curse will follow the film. What CUT consists of as a film is cliche after cliche with elements we have all seen before. The identity of the killer is beyond ridiculous and any attemps at red herrings before the killer is revealed are just poorly done. What CUT does have going for it are some good special effects, what few there are, and some funny moments, but not enough to save it. As the film has several elements which could have been used to good effect for a parody, they should have gone that route, but they take themselves too seriously and the ridiculous and overly basic plot brings it down that much further. I basically forced myself to finish this, as I wasted my money, and was happy when it was over; not to mention that I was sorely disappointed that Kylie Minogue was in only two scenes. If you enjoy crappy movies, you may get a kick out of this, but, if you are looking for anything more, you won't find it here.--Bob",1132963200,,1454,4.329670329670329
1420036,2,B00005B24M,"Every time I watch a film like ""Cut,"" I wonder why I feel the need to watch every horror film I can lay my hands upon. Why, I ask, would anyone subject themselves to such a derivative picture as ""Cut""? What purpose does such a thing serve? Am I trying to punish myself for some ancient, unremembered sin? A few minutes later, I start shifting the blame to the filmmakers. Why, I ponder, does a director feel the need to release a film that essentially rips off ""Scream""? Did they really think obtaining the services of one time '80s star Molly Ringwald would secure them an audience in the United States? Don't they realize this actress's best days on these shores are long gone? None of these questions have any adequate, let alone satisfactory, answers. Perhaps it should suffice to state simply that films like ""Cut"" arrive in the U.S. market because rental stores need product to fill gaps on the shelves. Or maybe someone really thought that making ""Cut"" was an original idea. No, scratch that. Even though this movie came from Down Under, the people responsible for this boring slasher film had to know that they were making something completely unoriginal. They had to, right? RIGHT?!?

The plot: A bunch of low budget filmmakers studying their trade at a university learn from their instructor, who just happened to work on the project back in the day, that an unfinished horror movie called ""Hot Blooded"" carries a most peculiar curse. The original director perished at the hands of a disgruntled co-worker, and ever since then anyone attempting to finish the film suffers a similar fate. Being inquisitive, bold filmmakers, the kids in his class take a vote and decide to try and finish the film. They even go so far as to acquire the rights and the completed reels from an elderly woman who, predictably, issues dire warnings that go unheeded. They also procure the services of the original star of the film, the pampered and egotistical Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), to pick up where she left off. With nothing but a dream and a few minor, uninteresting subplots, the young filmmakers head out to the original remote location to shoot their film. And wouldn't you know it? Before you can say, ""that's a wrap"" the crew starts dying off in particularly violent ways. The killer goes around wearing the garb of the villain in the film, just as he did when the murders first started all those years ago, and the movie lets us know right from the start that anyone and everyone could be the one behind the mask.

A killer clad in black, a bunch of red herrings, and plot twists and turns all point to the possibility that ""Cut"" may well fall within the parameters of an Italian giallo film. If only we could be that lucky. What we have here is your standard, by the numbers slasher film. Problems of metaphysical dimensions abound in this film. First, you've got a cast so big it could fill out the crowd scenes in a Cecil B. DeMille epic. There is the director Raffy Carruthers (Jessica Napier), the producer Hester Ryan (Sarah Kants), the cinematographer Damien Ogle (Sam Lewis), sound guy Rick Stephens (Stephen Curry), wardrobe chick Cassie Woolf (Erika Walters), boom operator Paulie Morrelli (Matt Russell), electrician Jim Pilonski (Steve Greig), and make up artist Julie Bardot (Cathy Adanek). Guess what happens when you have this many characters in a quickie slasher film? Yep, you guessed right; we spend so much time trying to remember who is who and what they are doing that we lose track of the film. With so much cannon fodder milling around it's quite difficult to flesh them all out in a way that makes us care about them. We barely have time to learn someone's name before they fall under the murderous attacks of the killer. The script tries to engage by throwing us a few bones, namely the old relationship jealousies between a few of the characters, but none of it really matters. Or helps.

The only interesting aspect of ""Cut"" concerns Molly Ringwald. It's been decades since ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" swept over the country like a tidal wave, and the intervening years haven't been too kind to Molly. She continued to make films, mostly in Europe, after her career faded in the United States. Occasionally we see her in a made for television movie or even a series, but she has more or less gone the route of fellow brat packers Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, and Andrew McCarthy. I can say this about Molly Ringwald in ""Cut"": she's as attractive as ever, if not more so since she's a bit older these days. Unfortunately, her performance as the volatile Vanessa Turnbill hits new heights in histrionic overemoting. I'm not sure if the character called for ham handed acting or not, but Ringwald saw the part as an opportunity to go over the top and never come back to earth. Maybe she didn't like the script and just decided to throw caution to the wind with the part, or maybe she's lost the skills she once showed in her teen flicks, but her performance in ""Cut"" definitely comes in somewhere near the bottom of her filmography.

Trailers for ""Cut,"" ""Attraction,"" and ""Blood Surf"" are the only extras on the disc. ""Cut"" is a film that would probably appeal to slasher completists more than any other segment of the viewing public. If you like watching films with titles like ""Slash,"" you'll find something to like here. Wait a minute, I like watching films with titles like ""Slash"" and I didn't find much to like here at all. Oh well, give it a shot if you simply must watch everything horror. Others would do well to give this one a pass.",1104969600,5,5592,4.6856561546286875
1420037,3,B00005B24M,"Filmed way down under in Southern Australia, this slasher flick has moments of suspense and surprise, but ultimately it fails to achieve what it probably wanted:  to be an original, frightening slasher movie.  Unfortunately, it's resolution of who the killer is far exceeds the bounds of credibility, even for a horror movie.  Molly Ringwald chews up the scenery like a young Bette Davis or Tallulah Bankhead.  While her performance is far less campy, she adds a kind of sophisticated stupidity to her role.  Kylie Minogue has a brief part and like many pop singers should stick to singing.  The direction is adequate, but doesn't fully approach the realm of terror it needs.  The rest of the cast perform adequately, but as in most of the newer slasher flicks, the plot holes and ridiculous actions of the cast, prevent CUT from being more than just another entry in a dying genre.",1100476800,2,882,4.84

1420040,1,B00005B24M,"A slasher flick, made in the early 80's, has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish it turning up dead.  Years later, a group of film students attempted to complete the movie - also resurrecting the films deadly curse.  Great idea for a film, but sadly `Cut' is just another wasted opportunity.

Unfortunately Australia hasn't had the world's best track record when it comes to horror.  `Razorback' (1984) was an out and out dud as was `Holwing III' (1987), which was half an American film anyway.  As for our foray into comedy-horror, `Body Melt' (1993) is best left forgotten.  The problem with `Cut' is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la `Scream' (1996) but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work.  And although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what `Cut' really lacks is any ""heart"".  Sure it follows the basic ""rules"" established by `Scream', but it doesn't want to play with the formula, instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier.

The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic  villians in horror movie history. His endless awkward, lame one-liners  would make a `Full Moon' movie seem like Shakespeare.  The cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks.  And the feel of the film is like it's deliberately trying not to be creepy; looking more like an episode of `Neighbors' or `Heartbreak High'.  By the way, those attempts at MTV style, hyper-cinema during the ""research"" sequence just look lame, dated and out of place.

If Australia ever gets a chance to do horror again (Which I hope we still do) maybe we should take a leaf from the `Mad Max' (1979) book.  Instead of trying to copy the U.S. we should be trying our own take on the genre.",1041033600,3,1857,4.564954682779456

The whole identity of the killer in ""CUT"" is actually absurd and ends up turning the movie into a bad episode of Nickelodeon's ""ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?""  or ""GOOSEBUMPS"". The identity of killer was a let down. The acting, however, was actually good for this type of movie..but the script needed some work (there are too many cliche one-liners at the end..especially by Molly's character). Also, the killings and gore were quite good and stylish. The only problem I have is the plot..and identity of the killer. Instead of making it 82 minutes, they should have fleshed it out more, creating more of a background on the characters. There is a ""secret"" that we find out about on the the main characters but it's just spoken once and it just doens't make sense that no one would know about it before.

This movie does something totally different.  It brings the 80's slasher back to us in a very hip way.  The soundtrack and great directing make every scene feel as if you are watching one long music video, and this isn't a bad thing at all.  Plot: Molly Ringwald comes back to Australia to finish a film called ""Hot blooded"".  As she and a group of film students start work on the movie, a killer appears and starts knocking off people(huge body count by the way).  First, I'd like to say that, as mentioned by some people, this the same kinda plot such as in Urban Legend 2, Scream 3.  Guess what?  They ripped off Cut's plot.  Cut's concept was invented years ago, but setbacks kept it from being made right away, so the American movie people got a chance to steal the idea and basically screw over Cut, ruining any chance of it coming to theatres here.  Yes, American movie studios, I shall get my revenge.  Back to the movie...it's not SCARY...it has suspense.  It doesn't try to be scary though.  It takes a different approach.  It's one of those movies that let's the audience in on the secret, such as, you see the killer coming up behing someone, but the person on screen doesn't see him.  An example of this is where they are filming a scene of ""Hot blooded"".  They think the man in the killer suit is an actor, but it is the REAL killer, and it just so happens it is the scene where he is supposed to murder main person he is after.  That kind of scene really builds suspense.  But suspense isn't all that is here.  This movie is beyond hillarious.  It is so campy, and it has fun with it.  Molly Ringwald has the best role, and best lines.  She's my favorite acctress, and I'm proud to say she does a great job in this.  She is the witchy/snobby has-been who thinks she is a huge star.  She really hams up the screen when it's time for comedy, then when it comes to suspense, she becomes an amazing heroin who will do anything to survive.

1420054,3,B00005B24M,"After this film, i found myself baffled. Why on earth was this film only mediocre when it had so much potential? The answer, i feel, lies primarily in the editing, secondly in the direction. If this film was only more finely edited, then the quality would've surely increased, and if the direction wouldve only been a tad more coherent, then perhaps the commercial success wouldve been greater. It seems pointless to dwell on would'ves and should'ves, but this film relays to the audience the basis of this principal. The film begins on the set of a horror-movie ""Hot Blooded"" with a fine cameo appearence from the Austalian superstar Kylie Minogue (my personal push to see this film), and although she was only in the film for about 2 minutes she gave a sound performance. Yet this whole opening scene seemed a tired cliche', and the film 'Hot Blooded' seemed to fulfil every boring cliche in the horror genre. Molly Ringwald gave a suprisingly uneven performance as the ""bare-survivor"" of the film, which , to be honest, was not her fault. The blame lies with the writing team - when she tries to attire the killers attention, she cries ""you make me wanna vomit..."" - at this point, i was thinking ""what the hell were the editors paid for??"". The rest of the acting was so mediocre, that i cant seem to recall another pronounced performance in the entirity of the movie. I found myself angry at the end that this movie failed, when it could have easily succeeded. My advice to anyone thinking about watching this film? - its definately worth a viewing, but don't be expecting anything of Scream quality.",995328000,,1605,4.715302491103203
7936317,3,B00005B24M,"I always have conflicted memories of 'Cut', I used to really like it but looking back now I don't think it's quite as good as I remembered it. It's directed by Kimble Rendall who went on to direct popular Aussie shark movie 'Bait' it stars American teen icon Molly Ringwald, Jessica Napier and pop star Kylie Minogue in a minor role. It was filmed in Adelaide mainly in the Adelaide Hills but I recognise a scene filmed at Port Adelaide which is where 'Bad Boy Bubby' was filmed.

 'Cut' comes across a bit like an Australian version of Scream it starts on the set of a movie being filmed called 'Hot Blooded' where the guy playing the killer 'Scarman' goes rogue and sick of being treated poorly by the director (Kylie Minogue) kills her on set. Molly Ringwald playing Vanessa manages to kill him he's electrocuted and dies but seems to have cursed 'Hot Blooded'.

 It fast forwards to the present day and one of the guys who worked on 'Hot Blooded' is now a film teacher and warns his students not to have anything to do with trying to finish the movie. The students naturally decided this would be a good idea and contact Vanessa (Ringwald) who is now a formerly popular movie star in the US and is convinced by her agent to return to Australia and finish the movie to ignite her stagnant career.

 They return to the big old house in the Adelaide Hills (Bridgewater to be exact) where 'Hot Blooded' was being filmed and begin filming again only for Scarman to reappear and start offing them one by one. Will they be able to destroy the original reel of 'Hot Blooded' before Scarman succeeds?

 It's a very rare and hard movie to find though even here in Australia. I hired it when as a new release from a video store back in the day but haven't come across it on DVD or even VHS since. I don't think it's ever been shown on regular TV here but for a few years I had pay TV and it was shown once on a channel on that so recorded it and transferred it to DVD knowing I would probably never come across the movie again.

 There are some funny lines throughout delivered mainly by well known comedic actor Stephen Curry and there is a couple of cool kills and a little bit of gore particularly the constant melting of Scarman. I hadn't watched 'Cut' in a long time and it still has plenty of charm.",1463702400,,2298,4.348130841121495

I liked the movie, but it was too short. Just when it's starting to get good, bam it's over. But I still liked it. The killer was different from others. Not bad! The disc was in great shape, the cover wasn't bad, and it arrived when it was supposed too. I am big horror fan, and thanks to you I got a other great flic!

7936320,5,B00005B24M,"In the vein of Scream, Cut is an over the top meta horror comedy that has a lot of skill and novel death scenes. It has a lot of references to slasher films and a perfect icon to the horror family by the name of Scarman. With a lot of violence and humor under it's belt, Cut is the kind of slasher film you should have.",1437868800,,319,3.8484848484848486

7936324,3,B00005B24M,"A killer's evil spirit returns and assumes a physical presence, in Cut (2000) a slasher flick set in Australia, which features some creative violence and nasty kills, delivered with a very dark sense of humor, by a masked killer whose signature weapon is a set of specially modified garden shears.  Molly Ringwald (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-in-Pink/dp/B000FZETIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty in Pink</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sixteen-Candles/dp/B007N31XO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sixteen Candles</a>), who was huge in the 80's, heads the cast, which also features a cameo by singer/actress Kylie Minogue.

In 1988, while filming a slasher called ""Hot Blooded"", the film's director Hillary Jacobs (Minogue) is murdered, by the actor playing a masked killer in the film.  About to become the next victim, actress Vanessa Turnbill (Ringwald) acts quickly, and jams a pair of garden shears into the killer's throat, while Lossman (Geoff Revell), a member of the crew, looks on.

Jumping forward to the year 2000, ""Hot Blooded"" remains unfinished, and Lossman is now teaching a class on filmmaking.  After learning of the unfinished movie, a group of Lossman's students decides to complete the film, discounting stories about a history of tragedy, connected with the unfinished movie.  Led by director Raffy Carruthers (Jessica Napier), and producer Hester Ryan (Sarah Kants), the group convinces former star Turnbill to fly over from America, and appear in the film.

Set to shoot at the same location as the original film, the production crew arrives, bringing with them canisters containing the film shot back in 1988.  Before long, the malevolent spirit of the masked killer captured on film, comes to life, and begins to attack the cast and crew.  The kills may not be the most graphic, but they are well-staged and mostly impactful.  In an amusing twist, the killer slashes the throat of the actor playing the killer in the movie, and takes his place on the set, just when Turnbill's death is about to be filmed.  Panic soon breaks out, and the movie proceeds to an extended, but intense and fiery conclusion, as Lossman returns to play a major role.

Cut is pretty well written, and features an interesting backstory and premise, and once the crew is in place and the killing starts, things flow pretty smoothly.  The gore is relatively stylish, and the acting not bad for a film of this type.  If you're a fan of 80's slashers, you'll probably appreciate this 3.5 star movie.  Another more recent film that utilizes some similar themes, is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Movie/dp/B002JHD9AK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Movie</a>&nbsp;(2008).",1347408000,,2812,5.824390243902439
7936325,4,B00005B24M,"I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel a while back and for the longest time could only remember the ""death"" of the villan. When I found out the name of the movie, I picked it up. Sure, it's nowhere near as good as Scream, but it's still a good watch. It was funny seeing Molly Ringwald in a sort of scary movie, as I've been used to seeing her in classic 80s movies like The Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink. Don't let the bad reviews sway you into not getting this movie. It's a lot of fun. Especially for a rainy day when you don't have anything else to do. The people giving this such horrible reviews are just movie snobs who think that every movie has to have some big meaning or make you think. Those kinds of movies are fine, but sometimes you just have to put on something mindless and relax for a couple of hours and not think about anything.",1292025600,,847,4.13939393939394
7936326,3,B00005B24M,"Molly Ringwald stars as an aged actress that is hired by a group of film school students to complete an unfinished film that she had starred in twelve years earlier, one which bears a terrible curse. Ever since the original director was killed by an embittered stuntman, anyone that has come in contact with the last remaining print has suffered a horrible fate. Unafraid of the alleged ""curse,"" the students set out to begin filming, but it isn't long before the killer returns to claim his latest batch of victims! Trailing shortly behind SCREAM, CUT is a spoof of a spoof with moments of cleverness but an all-too-familiar plot. Both the shooting style and self-reflective tone share most in common with the Post-Modern Slashers of the late-90's, while the punctuated music cues, inventive murders, and supernatural killer pool elements together from earlier cycle of films like FRIDAY THE 13th, HALLOWEEN, and their many sequels. Scarman's simple latex mask and jumpsuit also add to the 80's nostalgia imbued within the picture, and several of the deaths are extremely gruesome. CUT is too bland to be memorable, but it offers just enough suspense and bloodshed to make it worth the watch.
