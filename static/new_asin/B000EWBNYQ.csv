2542467,5,B000EWBNYQ,"Even in my house, this film gets mixed reviews.  My husband found it mediocre.  He walked away with a puzzled sense of incompletion, while I'm left wanting to chew over metaphor, color, design.  I loved it.

Maybe it has to do with what you're looking for.  Great acting?  Not really.  Tak Sakaguchi is gorgeous, but seems fairly stiff.  He doesn't stray far here from his role in _Versus_ (which I also loved.)  Great plot?  Not if what you're looking for is a traditional, linear story.  Familiarity with Japanese mysticism could help; the writers presume a certain knowledge base that many western viewers will lack.  But more than that, they allow viewers to interpret elements on their own...or not.  My husband saw meaningless distraction in the emphasis on hunger; I saw metaphor, pointing to an insatiable appetite of a different kind.  The cyclical plot made sense to me in the context of reincarnation/rebirth.

I think the plot as given is a template; you can use the little details dropped through the story to build something grander for yourself...but you don't have to, because arguably the story isn't the point.  This film is much about style over substance.  It's all sensation--sounds, visuals, movement.  Sometimes it's heavy-handed and clumsy, yes, but on balance it does an excellent job.  It's like an early Mark Romanek video, ""Closer"" with martial arts.  Set design, color and costume are at least as important as dialogue.  Composition is striking, but organic.  Why are these women dressed like that?  Who cares?  In the universe of _Death Trance_, they belong!

A lot of different influences seem to have gone into this production.  The director and star share a deep love of traditional Japanese set pieces, the ""jidaigeki"" epitomized to Western audiences in the work of Akira Kurosawa. (Trivia: George Lucas cobbled the word ""jedi"" out of the name of this genre).  In the ""making of"" documentary on the disc, both discuss their desire to update the form with the inclusion of modern (but highly stylized) weaponry.  George Miller's _Mad Max_ seems to have played some part in informing the aesthetic of the film, as far as some of the costuming at least.  Even the ""spaghetti western"" makes an appearance, with Grave a post-apocalyptic Django hauling his coffin of death behind him.

I found the movie tremendous fun.  For the most part bloodlessly violent (ENDLESSLY violent), it was an adrenaline release with just enough suggestion of more to set fire to my imagination.  I recognize it won't suit all tastes (didn't suit the husband's), but I will certainly be recommending it to my friends.  And watching it with them, when I can.",1170720000,38,2665,4.970521541950113
2542468,3,B000EWBNYQ,"The film ""Death Trance,"" is not the best film out there, in regards to samurai/fantasy, however, it will probably appeal to those viewers who liked ""Versus"" (maybe). The films main protagonist, Grave (Tak Sakaguchi) stars as a lone quasi-samurai who roams around looking for opponents to fight. Moreover, he carries around with him a coffin, which he stold from a Temple, and supposedly contains the body of a mythical Goddess. Furthermore, according to legend, if the coffin is taken to the Forbidden Forest, then that individual who takes it there will be granted a wish. Hence, Graves' quest is to take it there. The film basically follows Grave on his quest to take the coffin there.

Moreover, this Goddess, who is the Goddess of Destruction, if unleashed will cause complete and total destruction if released on Earth. Also making his way to this Forbidden Forest is one lone surviving monk, who has a magical sword that is somehow related to the coffin itself. He does not know how, or in what way it is related. All this monk knows is that it is important, and that he must ensure that it remains near the coffin. Grave meets up with another quasi-samurai named Sid who is also looking for the coffin. Meanwhile, a large gang is out looking for Grave, including a mysterious swordsman who knows all about the coffin and its magical sword. You will notice in the film the fight scenes are very strange, with guns, and rocket launchers. Definitely not your usual samurai film, however, it is a fantasy.

Basically, the film is about Graves' desire to fight the Goddess of Destruction. Contrary to the myth, the one who releases her will not be granted a wish: Instead she will destroy the world. If and when she is released she will destroy all of Earth, and then everything will be renewed again. That is unless someone happens to kill her. Thus, the reason and rationale behind Graves' desire to fight her: The ultimate fighter to Graves. This is not a great or above average film. In fact, it is more of a below average film. However, the film might appeal to those who like the fantasy/samurai genre. I found too many silly problems with the film, therefore, I recommend the film with extreme caution. It will appeal to some, but not all viewers. Also, I don't think that the action scenes or the fight scenes were as great as many of the viewers stated. Neither go into this film with high expectations, nor take this film too seriously. It's meant to be a fun film, and that's all.",1169596800,9,2493,4.663636363636364
2542469,5,B000EWBNYQ,"This movie is funny, sometimes intentionally, most of the time not, just like Versus, which well... is one of my favourite bad movies of all time. Versus 2 should be good, since Ryuhei Kitamura has improved considerably over the years... but I digress, you're here for Death Trance, or Tak Sakaguchi...

Tak Sakaguchi is the best bad actor in Japan, and you will probably only like him if A.) You watch anime or read manga. or B.) You like hot guys. I am an A-type Sakaguchi lover. He has a very animated look to him and is surprisingly a good action director, with his ""Zero Team.""

The other reviewers I'm sure have summed up the weird sub-par story, so I'll skip directly to the soundtrack and DVD features. The soundtrack is performed by the amazing Japanese Rock/Metal band ""Dir en grey."" If the well-choreographed action scenes don't rock your socks off, then the soundtrack will. As for the DVD, the menu music is great, and there is a great interview with Tak Sakaguchi who talks about his experiences. It is very entertaining and some of the best documentary material I've seen recently.

Only watch this film, if you like Tak, Dir en grey, and taking a chance on a movie. Whether this movie is Great or Horrible (yet hilarious) is up to you. There are only two bad actors in the film, and one of them has a very small part. The other one has a co-starring role, and is armed with a bad haircut and some sort of missle launcher.

No matter who you are, this movie definately leaves you thirsting for a sequel, just like Versus did.",1160265600,14,1540,4.508960573476703
2542470,5,B000EWBNYQ,"For those who have seen Ryuhei Kitamura's Versus and have been waiting quite patiently for the sequel, Death Trance will definitely fit the bill. Tak Sakaguchi from Versus fame plays the main character and action director in this action-packed film.

In a indeterminate time or place, Grave (Tak Sakaguchi) is a man with no past or future who's only goal is to find the ultimate fight. He steals a coffin from a holy temple said to contain the goddess of destruction. If she's released she will, that's right, destroy the whole world. Grave steals the coffin and is pursued by a monk (Takamasa Suga) carrying the only weapon that could destroy the goddess. This sword can only be unsheathed by ""the chosen one.""

Grave is pursued by various people who want the coffin because they all believe that it will grant your wishes. A lot of fighting ensues and really interesting characters appear. It's fast-paced so you'll totally enjoy every minute of the film without feeling it is dragging.

Tak Sakaguchi (Grave) plays this type of character only too well. He's not evil, he just likes to fight. Nothing wrong with that. The little girl that follows the coffin no matter who steals it is so cute with an interesting purpose of her own.

This movie is fun with a lot of cool fight scenes and none of the characters take themselves seriously making it funny too. I highly recommend it to all.",1156377600,13,1389,4.703703703703703
2542471,5,B000EWBNYQ,"It's kind of like Versus, except with more plot, less gore, and Tak looks a lot prettier (if that were possible). It is genuinely funny and very fast paced, so that you don't even notice 90 minutes pass by. The action is awesome, as it should be since Tak was the action director. I can't stop watching it over and over, and already infected my friends with it. The only possible problem is the ending, which is very frustrating and offers no resolution, so be prepared.",1153353600,13,470,4.476744186046512
2542472,1,B000EWBNYQ,"In this film, samurais fought with swords, guns and even anti-tank guns! It tried to be Mad Max but it failed miserably. The clothings and scene settings looked cheap and fake. The acting is like child's play. It's more like a comedy but it's not funny at all. How can they expect to make money with this? This is a typical bad B-movie

If you like Asian-style sword-fighting movies, look for House of flying daggers, Shinobi Heart under Blade, Shadowless Sword, Warrior (Korean movie), Iron Monkey. These movies are much better in terms of fighting and acting.",1152230400,,561,4.783505154639175
2542473,3,B000EWBNYQ,"Death Trance, starring Tak Sakaguchi in the lead role of Grave, a master samurai who has stolen the coffin that keeps the Goddess of Destruction imprisoned. His goal is to release her in order to fight the ultimate battle. Such is the synopsis on the back of the box, and that's pretty much all there is to the movie.

Like Versus, Death Trance doesn't rely on an in-depth script or complicated plot to progress what story it has. Mostly, Death Trance is a fighting movie. Everyone is fighting at some point, and everyone wants to get their hands on Grave's stolen coffin. There's Sid, played by Kentaro Segeal (sp?), a monk from the Temple named Ryuen, and a woman who knows the true story about the coffin. Following the coffin regardless of who has it is a little girl from the temple.

There seem to be attempts at making the plot interesting, but the story's synopsis on the box is pretty much it's own spoiler. Other minor characters talk about rumors about grave, saying that he's a giant man who plans to eat the little girl later. Other rumors are that the opened coffin can grant any wish you desire. Obviously these aren't true, and it doesn't make much sense that these keep being repeated.

Grave is well-played by Tak Sakaguchi, whose acting skills have certainly improved since his days on Versus. This is also his first lead role since Versus and Battlefield Baseball. An interview with Tak, which is one of the two major extra features on this disk, reveals how he tried to protray the character and what he thought of him. There's also a ""making of"" feature which is actually pretty short and half of which are just repeated of the Death Trance trailers and some of Tak's interview.

As said, there's not much of a story or plot, but if you're into martial arts action and enjoyed Versus, you'll like Death Trance. Fights with swords, staves, guns and even a bazooka can be seen. Despite having the air of a period piece, there's lots of modern action and items. (Grave's special weapon prior to recieving a sword is a long rifle that he keeps in a sword sheath.) There are other supernatural aspects as well. Some of the odd opponents that Grave faces are a group of vampires that are almost like spiders in that they built their own giant web in the forest.

Sid's motivation for the coffin is actually surprising once it's revealed. He's a rather dynamic character, and it's a shame he's not in action for very long. Ryuen is rather flat, mostly still overwhelmed with the task assigned to him and really needs to calm down. The female samurai seems to know a great deal but never lets on much until the end. The role that the little girl plays is hard to figure out, and once the Goddess is released from the coffin, she vanishes.

In conclusion, if you liked Versus, you'll probably also like Death Trance. This movie is actually a little more surreal than Versus, and that is really what sets them apart.",1151884800,16,2928,4.57824427480916
2542474,5,B000EWBNYQ,"For those of us who LOVED ""VERSUS"" and have been waiting for TAK to star in the sequel... ""Death Trance""  will definitely suffice in the meantime. The Director of ""Death Trance"" was also the Action Director in Versus, which was 90% of what made Versus so good to begin with, so Imagine that 90% plus, Tak Sakaguchi, the other 10% needed to make the movie great.

On a plot scale it rates about a 3 out of 5, but the action scenes, the tributes to Versus and the great camera angles and zooms dedicated to continually making TAK look great, are enough to call this movie a keeper. It's FUNNY, FAST, and Tak introduces his stunt team ""ZERO"" (meaning zero casualties) who basically, don't pull their punches when they work. So talk about a huge touch of realism to any action movie, when the star and his stunt people are really hitting each other! It's just a really FUN and entertaining movie. And with the way they end it, you are left wanting MORE!",1151712000,12,949,4.448275862068965
2542475,3,B000EWBNYQ,"A coffin that contains the Goddess of Destruction was stolen from the Eastern monks that guard it. It is rumored that if the coffin is opened in the western forbidden forest, it will grant wishes. A monk Is tasked to go after the coffin, along with a sword that can only be used by ""the chosen one.""

The film has interesting characters, including a guy with big hair and a gun, a six shooter that shoots nine bullets and there is a shotgun thing with an infinite number of bullets. The coffin is dragged along the ground by chains, although there are wheels as we see in one scene which has a motorcycle. The fighting was anything but martial arts and utilized a metal sound track. The forest had interesting men that were zombie, vampire, spider.

It was an interesting fantasy film, young gamers might like.

2542483,4,B000EWBNYQ,"I didn't dislike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Versus/dp/B00009EIRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Versus</a>, the first collaboration between martial artist Tak Sakaguchi and action director Yuji Shimomura, but I was debilitatingly confused by its meant-to-be-weird storyline and therefore wished for a movie just like it, only more comprehensible. ""Death Trance"" is too much of its own adventure and a different style of feature altogether to be that film, but comparisons probably can't be avoided due to the involvement of Sakaguchi and Shimomura. Devotees of ""Versus"" might turn down this one's mainstream approach and reduced ambiguity, but I, as a general action movie fan, applaud that the film is both undeniably cool and halfway understandable. It's more accessible to general moviegoers and is definitely easier for me to love.

The story: a mysterious coffin containing the body of the goddess of destruction and said to grant any wish to whomever opens it is stolen from a temple and subsequently sought after by four individuals - a warrior addicted to combat (Sakaguchi), a monk tasked with returning the artifact to its temple (Takamasa Suga,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cromartie-High-The-Movie/dp/B000F2CAII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cromartie High - The Movie</a>), a bazooka-wielding rogue (Kentaro Seagal,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seamless/dp/B000055YVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seamless</a>), and a mysterious swordswoman (Yuki Takeuchi).

Not unlike most Japanese movies I've seen, the film's stellar art direction catches your eye at once. Excellent visuals and intriguing costumes (sort of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Swords/dp/B000ICLU7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Swords</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Hill/dp/B000GCFO0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Hill</a>) make the very most of whatever budget the picture had. CGI isn't an integral part of the imagery and doesn't really become abundant until the last fifteen minutes or so, so it's all the more impressive that just about everything you see onscreen was captured on-location and not post-productioned. The characters inside these CGI-free costumes and visuals, however, aren't necessarily as compelling: with the exception of the monk, just about all of the main characters are kept a bit too enigmatic for my taste, since it's difficult to like or dislike anybody based on their actions when you don't know what their motivations are. Nevertheless, the parts are played well and the casting's admirable; practically genius when considering that the film has Kentaro Seagal - son of Steven - finally making his action movie debut after two mostly bad drama pictures.

This action content is comprised overwhelmingly of martial arts and general beat-'em-ups, with a bit of swordfighting and gunplay thrown in at key moments. Tak Sakaguchi really shines as the star of most of these; his legitimately aggressive hand-to-hand fights are like grounded versions of Jet Li's in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unleashed/dp/B000A2IPQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unleashed</a>, featuring rapid-fire handwork and painful-looking kicks to the head. Kentaro Seagal and Yuki Takeuchi get to show off with their respective weapons (Seagal wields katana, revolvers, and a bazooka in a single fight) but don't demonstrate too much martial artistry and have fewer brawls than ol' Tak. Between the three of them, they engage a load of interesting villains, including a swordsman wielding a blade stolen from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-VII/dp/B00000JRSB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy VII</a>, a capoeira fighter with razor spurs attached to his feet, and a gaggle of spider-like vampires climbing webs of bandages. The general choreography is a bit less inventive than your average Hong Kong or Thai actioneer, but all of the fights are presented without much editing or an overabundance of wirework and appealing camera angles.

I'd be lying if I said that I understood the plot completely, especially the ending, but the ambiguity isn't maddening and a lot of the film's weirdness (e.g. the little girl following the coffin, the hooded zombie characters) is neat and interesting enough on its own without an explanation necessary. Though I'll definitely need a second viewing to figure out why Tak Sakaguchi is eventually able to unsheathe the monk's sword, this movie doesn't need to be mapped out to be enjoyed.

2542484,5,B000EWBNYQ,"Hey everyone, I just finished watching the blu-ray. I had already seen the film previously on DVD which I enjoyed so I had to pick up this version

Picture Quality - 5/5

The film is naturally a bit grainy but that adds to the feel of the film. The blu-ray really helps bring the colors and scenery of the film out. Everything looks much more crisp and it really helps with telling whose who during those big fight scenes.

Sound Quality - 5/5

I was incredibly impressed with the sound in this film. The music fits perfectly with the fight scenes. I will admit that the dialogue is a bit quiet for how loud the action scenes are. The dubbing in this film is top notch. I should add that the monk is played by Johnny Young Bosch. Don't worry though, he really pulls is off. I should also add that if you're a fan of Dir en Grey(like myself) You'll love this film as they compose the entire soundtrack.

Movie - 5/5

This is a really difficult film to rate the story for because it's really one of those ""figure it out as you go along"" type of films. So if I go into too much depth I will spoil something. The main character in the film is a man named Grave played by Tak Sakaguchi of Versus fame. In this film he plays more of an anti-hero type role and has longer hair. I actually much prefered his character in this in comparison to Versus.

The movie takes place in a bleak future. Although to say that it's a post-apocolyptic movie is misleading. It has a very Japanese feel to it, and there is a high chance you will find it very different compared to its Hollywood counter parts. As another reviewer mentioned, having some knowledge of Japanese lore helps with understanding the film.

The fight scenes are the biggest part of the film and contain hand to hand combat, sword combat, and shooting. The majority of the film consists of fighting with bits of story inbetween to guide you through to the conclusion.

I can't say much more about the film without spoilering anything. If you read my review however, and it peaked your interest, I definately recommend giving this film a chance as you will almost certainly not be disappointed.",1303344000,2,2143,4.418781725888325

As a cutting edge movie, this film is great. It may not be for everyone though. The traditional samurai film aficionado may not like it.  Those of us who appreciate the new breed of Japanese action adventure and samurai action will love it.

One of the main things about this movie is that the samurai fight scenes are very good. The scenes are very well choreographed and played out very well. This is something that a number of the new breed of samurai films lack.

For the girls, there are some very hot guys in this movie. There are some very pretty girls as well.

2542490,4,B000EWBNYQ,"In an Unknown Place and an Unknown Time, The Goddess of Destruction Lies Trapped in a Sealed coffin.
Confined, she is held at bay from laying waste to the World.
That is, until a lone samurai warrior dubbed the ""coffin man"" (nameless but credited as Grave) comes along. His one thirst is for battle and he is MORE than willing to unleash the Goddess of Destruction from her long imprisonment--to satisfy his appetite for destruction.

From the action director of Ryuhei Kitamura's ""VERSUS"" comes a film that defies logic, time and place. ""DEATH TRANCE"" (2006) stars Tak Sakaguchi, and if you've seen ""Versus"" then you know how cool this guy can be when he holds a sword. Tak has made appearances in ""Azumi"", ""Shinobi Heart Under Blade"" and even ""Tokyo Gore Police"", and I bet anyone would be hard-pressed to notice since the man is like a chameleon. Directed by Yuji Shimomura, this film is action-packed and of course, has the elements of mysticism and mystery.

The film's tagline doesn't misdirect: an unknown place and unknown time, without reasons and with no future. We assume that the film takes place in Japan, but it is a Japan that no one has ever seen. This Japan is full of mystical creatures, vampires, fallen angels and food that looks very inedible. The time is definitely undetermined, while the costumes are somewhat inspired by feudal times, it has that futuristic feel. Ninjas are abound, motorcycles, bazookas, guns and katana swords are used but the film looks very ancient with the look of the architecture and its backdrop. The motivations behind our hero's trek to the forbidden forest is one that defies logic; who would want to mess with a Goddess of destruction? The film also has no end, hence the tag ""no future"". It gives hints that there is no end or maybe there is a sequel in the works, which may be released or not in U.S. shores.

The characters in ""Death Trance"" will remain enigmatic and nameless (but the end credits reveal their names). Our main anti-hero (Grave, played by Tak Sakaguchi) is a man with no background, although the film's screenplay helps with very minor development. All we know is that he stole a coffin from a temple, so he may bring it to the forbidden forest. (shades of ""Versus""?) The film is about destiny and the journey to fulfill it, whether it may mean chaos. Tak is the right man for the role, the film exudes that anime-inspired atmosphere and this man is an anime character come to life. (he is also the only actor who can pull off the ""mascara"" aside from Johnny Depp) The most mysterious character will have to be the nameless woman (credited as Yuuri, played by Yuhki Takeuchi) who is alluringly attractive. This woman assists in the unraveling of the story, she knows something no one else does and she isn't telling. The questions as to who or what she is will be revealed but it won't be until the final act. Sid (played by Steven Seagal's son, Kentaro Seagal) is the bazooka-toting man who is also after the coffin, and together with Ryuen (Takamasa Suga), who tells the story, provide some added ""meat"" to the script. Oh, there is a cute little girl (Honoka Asada) who follows the coffin around--and you guessed it, she adds more to the aura of the creepy and the unexplained.

The coffin itself is an enigma--some believe that it can grant your fondest wish, others say it will bring about destruction; but everyone wants it and they all agree that it is an object of power. The antagonists in the film consists of acrobatic vampires, shambling things clad in black, two sword-wielding sisters (Masumi Shirai and Mie Nakao), ninjas, capoeira fighters--plus, there is a freaky looking trio of small dolls that may have come from Japanese lore. The film also has its air of mysticism as there is a sword with a throbbing heartbeat that cannot be unsheathed. Not to worry, it all does come together in the end.

The action sequences are numerous and most of them occur in the forest or in a sandy plain. I've already mentioned that Tak is very entertaining to watch with a sword but here, you get to see him do boxing, kickboxing and even judo. The fight scenes are nicely choreographed and paced, director Shimomura knows his stuff. The story revolves around the fight scenes as different characters want the coffin, and the more Tak fights, the closer we get to the climactic encounter with the severely underdeveloped ""Goddess of destruction"" (Beauteous Yoko Fujita). The only problem is, the outcome of the initial fights were never in doubt, Tak Sakaguchi is just too cool to be beaten by a bunch of low-life's. The final fight happens in an alternate plane and looks beautiful, but it was a little too short. The action effects consists of spewing dirt, floating rocks that gives more validity to its anime-like feel.

""Death Trance"" is a film with a lot of action and style which is its best asset. The plot is definitely too simple and some may question the fact that the film lacks closure--which is also its intention. See it with the proper mindset and you will no doubt be entertained, it may even redefine the term ""mindless"" fun but it is part of its charm. It is vibrant, nicely shot, original and energetic, it can make you scratch your head because of its subtle humor and outright silliness, occasionally creepy, but definitely PURE and honest in what it wanted to do. If you liked ""Versus"" then you would no doubt enjoy this film (but it hardly has any blood and gore). As I've said, if you found its tagline appealing then you will appreciate it for its entertainment value.

Recommended! To fans of Japanese cinema [3  Stars]

This Ultimate version from Tokyo Shock has two discs. This anamorphic transfer has a ratio of 1.85 (the previous single disc release is 1.78 ratio) that appeared cleaner, more vivid and sharper than the previous transfer. Colors were intentionally ""muted"" as part of its style. 5.1 Dolby/2.0 Japanese/English language tracks with great subtitles. Please see this in its original Japanese language.
Extras:
There are no added scenes in the film as far as I could tell in this new release. This ""Ultimate"" edition does sport a very nifty steelbook cover.

2542492,4,B000EWBNYQ,"While I haven't seen ""Versus,"" I enjoyed ""Death Trance.""  The look and cinematography of the movie were visually stunning.  The sequence in the bar, which devolves into an epic battle, hints at the zombie like battle that takes place in the forbidden forest.  Director Yuji Shimonmura had also teamed with lead actor Tak Sakaguchi in ""Versus.""  My sense while watching the film compares to watching a Japanese Bergman.  We see the death imagery of the coffin dragged through forests, the final forest with the skeleton warriors and failed seekers imbedded in trees.  Yoko Fujita as the Goddess of Destruction is as lovely as she is deadly.  There is a real sense of a Titan clash between Grave (Tak Sakaguchi) and the Goddess.  Takanasa Suga, as the monk, follows like a religious repo man who controls the sword that will only come alive in the right hands.  The imagery of the little girl who follows the coffin was an ominous use of the child, making the seemingly innocent into the sinister.  I took her to be like a soul embodiment of the Goddess waiting for release from the coffin.  I found this film to be equal parts fresh and strange.  It is too slow moving to be strictly an action genre; therefore, it is more of a cerebral experience trying to figure out the puzzle.  I liked the spider-web imagery of the forest as a trap and was struck with the apocalyptic transformation at the end.  While I'm not absolutely sure what each small thing meant, this was a gripping viewing experience that had me riveted from beginning to end.  Enjoy!",1187222400,10,1548,4.681481481481481
2542493,2,B000EWBNYQ,"I wanted to like this movie.  Having recently been pleasantly surprised with ""Azumi"", I was hoping for another little gem.

Instead, I am bombed with what sounds like 8th graders practicing CrapMetal in the garage.

I could overlook the thin character development, and lack of plotting, as there were some funny moments in the movie.
But just when I start to find myself liking this film, here comes the horrid soundtrack to kick that feeling in the groin...

If you do buy this, turn on sub-titles and put on your own music.
What a waste...",1183334400,8,541,4.663157894736842

It was entertaining to watch and had some awesome characters. I am going to give it 3 stars because,it tried to outdo Versus and failed.

8115144,5,B000EWBNYQ,"Its hard to really rate this movie because it's one of those that you either enjoy, or will hate.  I'm giving it 5 stars more because there seem to be a lot of negative reviews and I don't want those to dissuade anyone from ""trying this one on for size"" than trying to give an objective review of a movie that is clearly going to be received very differently by different people.
The movie is highly decorative visually, with an impressive amount of action, although the action is, for the most part, bloodless.  The plot is thin at the ""tactical"" level, though more robust at the ""strategic"" level -- but is still not a complex story.  This movie is to be watched and enjoyed.
I found it interesting to see the reviews pointing out the lead actor is the same from the movie ""Versus"". I hadn't realized that, but that was another movie I really enjoyed, so if you find you like this one, definitely follow up with watching that.",1466726400,,928,4.447058823529412

8115147,4,B000EWBNYQ,"This movie is completely off the wall and I had no idea what was going on until near the end. There doesn't seem to be much of a plot until the reveal at the end of the movie, only then does it make sense. There are a lot of action scenes and a bit of comedy. I think this movie uses the WTF? factor as a hook and if you take the bait you probably won't be disappointed. When I first saw this movie and I saw the man dragging the coffin behind him I thought it was a Japanese version of ""Death Rides a Horse"" or the original ""Django"" but the only thing ""Death Trance"" has in common with them is the coffin. Throughout most of the movie you will be wondering why he is dragging the coffin, but you won't find out for certain until the reveal near the end.",1438387200,,754,3.9671052631578947
