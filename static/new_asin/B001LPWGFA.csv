3689397,5,B001LPWGFA,"I fell in love with this film, but importantly...my kids loved it. One of the most entertaining animated films I have seen in a LONG time!",1233446400,,138,4.346153846153846
3689398,5,B001LPWGFA,"People keep comparing this film to Tim Burton, but the humor is much funnier and more sarcastic.  Maybe the problem is that too many of those viewing the film have never seen Young Frankenstein.  In this animated film, Igor finally gets his day in the sunlight.  The problem is, he finds out that the sunlight isn't what it was cracked up to be and that leads to an even better ending.  The voice artists are fantastic and Buschemi steals the show.  The score, complete with full symphony orchestra is worthy of the old classic horror films.  The only problem is that the cover art makes this movie seem childish and shallow, when it is comedic, sophisticated, and brilliant!",1233446400,2,675,4.677966101694915
3689399,4,B001LPWGFA,This movie would be most appreciated by older viewers primarily because of the witty parodies of old school horror movies. The stylized animation detail and movement were well done and not so over bearing as to take attention away from the story; the excellent celebrity voice choices and interesting music selections.,1233187200,,318,5.254901960784314
3689400,3,B001LPWGFA,"This one I want to be great, was disappointed in that respect but overall, despite the bad lighting (in a CGI movie to boot) Igor is an original cartoon.  Don't expect any textures or curves in this boxy, shiny and stylized account of an Igor who wants to be a scientist.  The rabbit and brain sidekicks are the best part of the movie, the big Bride of Frankenstein showgirl I thought to be the drawback, and she was supposed to be the big joke.

Not the worst CGI I ever saw but with the material at hand the possiblities they blew are astounding.",1232496000,3,548,4.300970873786408
3689401,4,B001LPWGFA,"Enjoyed this movie mainly for its highly imaginative visuals and an engaging story.  Celebrity voices are always a nice touch, and it was funny to hear two late-night hosts lend their talents to this particular picture.  The storyline, though a fairly by-the-rules effort, was carried by a quirky, non-conventional concept of the world through eyes of a lab assistant to a mad/high-tech scientist.",1232150400,2,397,5.285714285714286
3689402,3,B001LPWGFA,"I came in wanting to like this movie. Growing up, the Westinghouse/Intel science fair always inspired me - you know, the one where high-school students present their masters- or doctorate-level research. The kids in the top ranks were my peer heroes (Me? Their peer? As if). So of course I had warm feelings toward another kid who wanted to do well in the science fair.

'Igor' tells an amusing story of that science-fair kid. Even after losing his mentor, or because of losing him, Igor struggles down to the deadline to complete his project. (That much sounds very familiar.) Then, as in any good science fair project, there's a last minute glitch. This is the Evil Science Fair. Only evil science can qualify. Igor's project doesn't seem evil at all. In fact, his monster doesn't have an evil bone in her body. Well, maybe she does, but it doesn't work at all. Then there's the competition ...

Animation works well in this movie, especially over-the-top exaggerations in each character's appearance. Eva (no relation to Wall-E's Eve) gives a stunning performance of the Tomorrow song from Annie, literally stunning. Even though a side-kick himself, Igor has his own amusing side-kicks, including a suicidal but immortal bunny whose self-inflicted violence ends up as harmless as any from Tom and Jerry. On the whole, it's a mild but enjoyable bit of kid-safe fluff.

Go ahead. Throw The Switch!

3689403,4,B001LPWGFA,"I want to give it 5 Stars because the screenplay is SO funny but I don't care for the animation - reminiscent of Nightmare Before Xmas.
It's like this movie was MADE for the dry genius wit of Steve Buscemi. He just SHINES in this. (He's a rabbit.)
I believe they cut the ending too short. Sweet little last joke but instead of kind of fading out so we could enjoy it, the filmmakers just cut it short and went to new song and the credits.
A good premise and a nice family film. But maybe too scary for under 9 yrs of age.",1228176000,7,521,4.019230769230769

3689453,5,B001LPWGFA,"Imagine a world where ""Igor"" isn't just the name of a mad scientist's hunchbacked assistant, but where mad scientists enter a science fair every year to see who is the most evil, and where ""Igor"" is a noun for all their hunchbacked assistants, and the whole class or race of people doomed to lives as the assistants of the presumably more intelligent and definitely more privileged scientists.

Now imagine that, in this society, one Igor is smarter than any of the scientists, and the most evil mad scientist is a dunce who only wins the evil contest every year because (SPOILER ALERT) his sexy female assistant poses as various sexy assistants to spy on the competitors for him.

Next, imagine that this smart Igor gives his master some advice, but his master is so stupid and arrogant that, by refusing to take his Igor's advice, he accidentally blows himself up, leaving his Igor to pose as him and enter the annual evil contest where (SPOILER  ALERT) he breaks through the glass ceiling between mad scientists and Igors, and (SPOILER ALERT)  falls in love with the monster he invented to win the contest.

Hard to imagine?  Imagine these characters and their monsters sounding like Jay Leno, John Cusack, Molly Shannon, and Steve Buscemi!

Finally decided it was cheaper to buy it, and Karan was so proud to get a package in the mail with his name on it.  I really enjoy it, too.  John Cusak did an excellent job as Igor, and I really enjoyed Steve Buscemi as the suicidal rabbit.  I once worked on a project with Steve's artist cousin in Beaumont, Texas.  His whole family is wonderfully gifted.  Bryan (Brain) was excellent comic relief.  I don't mind watching it over and over again,either.  It's a great movie.",1467331200,,634,4.426086956521739

The story line is wonderful in it and the characters are well thought out. Some adults, if they do not like horror or animation, might find this a bit boring. Parts of it where a yawn but overall it was a very decent film. Not one I would add to the favorites but not bad to watch once in awhile.",1455494400,,438,3.932584269662921

The movie tries to tackle topics like being the underdog, beauty is skin deep, the evil genius, so on & so forth but ends up lurching from one to another. None of the characters have really been developed well and the viewer keeps thinking that there is something better in the next frame, only to be disappointed.

On the bright side, the film valiantly tries to go against the grain by having characters who are neither cute nor lovable. It also tries to champion the underdog who prevails against all the odds.",1374278400,,762,4.595588235294118

Louis Prima songs were an interesting (in a good way) choice.  I was able to purchase this at a big box store for $5 and was surprised that the animation and voice over work was really quite good!

3689678,4,B001LPWGFA,"I remember previews for Igor on television right around the same time DreamWorks was promoting their monstrous animated Monsters Vs. Aliens and while it's pretty safe to say that this one managed to get lost in the hype created by the big guys, the content here can hardly be blamed.

In fact, one of the few factors that actually prevent it from going toe to toe with the giants of the industry is the fact that it was created independently and on a fairly modest budget at that.  The concept, the homage to classic horror flicks, and the sheer cleverness of it all are certainly the type of goodness we expect from the likes of Pixar.

Speaking of such things, the tale goes something like this: In the bleak and dismal land of Malaria, children are born into one of only two castes: Mad scientist or Igor (depending upon physical characteristics such as having a hunched back for example).

Igor, our Igor is, you guessed it, an Igor, one of the preordained sidekicks to one of Malaria's 13 evil mad scientists upon graduation from Igor school where such skills as the art of switch pulling; slurred speech and tying a proper cloak are taught.  Igor (voiced perfectly by John Cusack) was intelligent enough to graduate with a  ""Yes Masters Degree"" in fact.

Igor is assigned to one Dr. Glickenstein (John Cleese) and is forced into a life of suppressing his true intelligence in favor of the servitude that all Igors exist to endure.

Creating two sidekicks in Glickenstein's employ (Brain (Sean Hayes), a sentient brain in a glass jar, and Scamper (Steve Buscemi), an immortal suicidal mutant rabbit), Igor works in secret developing an idea unlike any before it: To create genuine life.

It turns out that nearly everyone in Malaria aspires to evil genius greatness. Each year, the king selects one wicked man-made device and uses it to blackmail the entire world (which is the basis for Malaria's economic system).

Igor just so happens to have created an invention perfect for the task except for two minor problems: The female Frankenstein monster (Eva (Molly Shannon)) he created is anything but evil and evil genius inventions are supposed to come from Mad Scientists, not their hunched over, abused assistants.

The visuals of this film are quite well done and fantastically thematic for the gothic undertones of a modern monster movie.  While the textures pale in comparison to works like Pixar or DreamWorks' inflated-budgeted films, there is a lot to be excited about here.

The character models are wildly disproportionate (stylized in fact) and pay homage to animated classics like Rankin/Bass' Mad Monster Party while simultaneously sparking Burton-esque tones of disturbia found in pieces like Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride.

Voice work is spectacular with both Cusack and Buscemi in particular providing inspired deliveries.  But even the supporting cast of Molly Shannon and Jennifer Coolidge and Jay Leno do a bang up job.

The pacing is consistent and an enjoyable plot structure aids in keeping the film flowing.  Most of the humor will appeal to viewers of all ages and the older set especially may find great enjoyment in picking out the classic monster movie homages sprinkled throughout.

About my only complaint with this one is that though always done in good taste, a few of the concepts may be a bit too dark for young-viewer appreciation.  If that's a concern, parents may wish to give this one a viewing beforehand to determine whether or not the material is suitable for the youngsters.

In all Igor finally drives home the point that a limitless budget and major studio backing are not requisites in crafting a masterwork of modern computer animation.  I can state with confidence that this film manages to succeed in the monster movie genre more convincingly than either Pixar's Monsters Inc. or DreamWorks' Monsters Vs Aliens.  I suspect that had this screenplay fallen into the proverbial lap of either major studio, a slightly more streamlined prose would have resulted but that's neither here nor there.

What is here is charming, filled with heart and the type of cleverness that the computer generated animated feature film has made famous.  After all, as the tag line professes, ""not all men are created evil.""",1288656000,,4267,4.952314165497897
3689679,5,B001LPWGFA,The condition of the movie was excellent and I recieved two days after I ordered it. It is a great movie and awesome for the entire family.,1288051200,,139,4.185185185185185
3689680,3,B001LPWGFA,"I should start by saying that, as a fan of both classic horror films and spoofs of classic horror films, I really wanted to like Igor.  I really did. But I couldn't help feeling through most of the movie that the creators _really_ should've spent more time on the script.  You can see what they were going for, and you can also see how the concept should have been great. But the execution however, never quite hits the mark.

A big problem is the design. You cannot watch Igor without comparing it to The Nightmare Before Christmas, not only because of the stop-action animation similarity but because the sheer look of the film seems so clearly derivative of Nightmare Before Christmas. Eva is modelled on Sally, and I could swear that they actually reused Nightmare's Mayor action figure for Igor's King Malbert. And even if you can get past the visual derivation, there's the problem of characters seeming derivative.  Brain, the classic sci-fi/horror ""brain in a jar"", has a personality derived from a different source: B.O.B. the Blob in Monsters Vs Aliens.

Only two characters really stand out. Igor (voiced by John Cusack) is clearly drawn and likeable and can _almost_ make you care enough to ignore the film's short-comings.  And Scamper (voiced by the inimitable Steve Buscemi) is actually the best thing about the film:  an acerbic, immortal rabbit who wants desperately to commit suicide.  And who has all of the best lines:

Igor: [shouts] Pull the switch!
[Nothing happens. He looks over at Scamper, standing by the switch]
Scamper: Do *not* yell at me.
Igor: Oh, I-I'm sorry. I just... pull the switch?
[No response]
Igor: Please pull the switch.
Scamper: That's better.

Brain: Our work here is done.
Scamper: 'Our work'? You spent the whole time playing with a piece of ribbon.

Igor isn't a bad film. It's an okay film with occasional moments where it's actually good. But it could've been a really good film if the writers and designers had just given it one more good going-over before putting it into production. Recommended for fans of stop-action animation and of spoofs of horror films with an hour and a half to kill.  And for Steve Buscemi fans.",1287360000,2,2173,4.811827956989247
3689681,5,B001LPWGFA,"Saw Igor in the theater when it came out and just had to have it.  This movie is fun for kids and adults.  And it's more fun for the adults, because we get more of the jokes.  Well worth the purchase.",1277337600,,200,3.8292682926829267
3689682,3,B001LPWGFA,"I think the general flavor of these reviews captures this small production accurately. If you are the kind of person who believes a reference to a favorite movie in another film makes that second film inherently worth viewing, then this is for you. Do you enjoy shouting aloud, ""Ha! See that? They're referencing the scene in Bride of Frankenstein when Elsa Lanchester....""? If that's you, you'll be enchanted, because they invoke every old horror movie I've ever seen.

If, however, you want a film with something original, something not wretchedly PC, and something witty and clever, then I'm afraid you must go elsewhere. This is not vile, and was visually well done, and my 11 year old grandson was amused. But slight, predictable, and ever so gentle, this film genuflects at every PC altar and ignores any where quality or originality is held up.",1277078400,,851,4.909722222222222
3689683,2,B001LPWGFA,"I was very dissappointed by this movie.  Granted I knew it wasn't a blockbuster, but the whole story was flawed.  The main character's companion bunny spends the entire movie depressed and trying to kill himself, but he's been genetically modified to be unkillable.  So he goes through various means of trying to commit suicide and keeps living, which makes him unhappy-er.  Great for kids, huh?  Then the whole premise of creating things to blackmail the world to pay their town was pretty adult concept.  I didn't find a whole lot of humor in the story either.  I really didn't want to have my little kids (5 & 8) watching a movie where one of the characters is depressed and tries to kill himself, but after starting the movie was in an awkward situation as kids love movies.

3689702,5,B001LPWGFA,"We chose to get this movie because of the actors, but our expectations were fairly low, based on many of the reviews here. Imagine our surprise when we discovered that Igor is a charming movie, full of heart and humor from the beginning!

Note, however, that this is not a movie to just ""sit"" the kids in front of and walk away.  There is enough complexity in the characters and the story that one would want to be present to explain things as needed.

Having said that, I cannot say enough about the story line and the characters. Despite the short time line imposed on the creative team, the script was well written, the musical choices superb and the voice-over work impeccable. Although John Cusak and Molly Shannon were probably never in the same room together, it is not at all apparent in the movie, which isn't always the case. The cast boasts a laundry list of wonderful actors and performances, but Eddie Izzard deserves special kudos for his quite evil, yet not TOO over-the-top, Dr. Schadenfraude.

Is it an old story? Perhaps. Is it predicable? Sure. Does it borrow from tired cliches? Absolutely. But it is also a universal story, with a familiar arc, and characters that the viewer can identify with. And it does all this with respect, and love, which is why it feels fresh and (if you'll pardon the pun) it's alive! I'm sure we will watch this movie again and again.

The one thing that frustrates me about Amazon reviews is that reviewers often don't give readers a reference point from which to compare their (the reviewer's) taste to one's own. To that end, I will say that we are substance-over-flash people: we found Wall-E mostly vapid, condescending and heavy handed, while we watch Hoodwinked over and over for its heart, well developed characters and intelligent humor.",1253923200,,1794,4.737179487179487

One day Igor gets the chance to prove be can really be an evil scientist when his master Dr. Glickenstein(John Cleese) becomes the victim of his own experiment and Igor decides to take his only chance to fulfill his dreams of winning the evil science fair.

Igor turns to his only two friends to help him, a Brain who named himself Brian on accident(Sean Hayes) and Scamper(Steve Buscemi) who Igor accidentally made immortal and constantly tries to commit suicide. Their plan comes into motion when Igor remembers his blueprints to create life into a purely evil monster, something no evil scientist has ever done in the entire history of Malaria!

Only their plan goes awry when Igor forgets to activate their new creations evil bone, and Eva(Molly Shannon) instead becomes overly kind and instead of destroying cities or killing blind orphans dreams of becoming an actress.

Maybe an homage to Tim Burton, definitely a re-telling of Frankenstein but Igor still carries a completely fresh and poignant look at a beloved genre in the film industry; horror.

Igor is creative, witty and completely different from any animated film that I for one have seen in a very long time. The humor is sarcastic, and a little sardonic and honestly it probably flies right over 80 percent of it's viewers heads.

Maybe I'm biased seeing as how I love pretty much everything Cusak touches, but I for one wouldn't mind adding this one to my dvd collection.",1249344000,4,1718,4.826530612244898
3689708,3,B001LPWGFA,"Thus goes the main line from the film IGOR, a computer animated film that has its roots planted firmly in the land of Universal horror and its tongue firmly in cheek.

The film takes place in the land called Malaria where its economy is based solely on the inventions of mad scientists seeking ultimate weapons to be sold to countries globally. The land was once a fruitful place but climate changes have seen those days long gone and the new world of science replacing it.

Every mad scientist in the land attempts a new creation each year in the hopes of winning the coveted prize of top scientist. And each scientist has his own helper, all with the same name, Igor. As they reach the moment of truth in their labs, they all call out the same thing: ""Igor! Throw the switch!""

Unfortunately for Dr. Glickenstein (John Cleese), the test run of his invention this year results in his untimely demise. But his Igor (John Cusak) doesn't let anyone know. It seems Igor has a mind of his own and does his own experiments in his off moments. He's brought back a rabbit from the dead and made him immortal (a running joke throughout the film as he finds different ways to attempt to kill himself) and a brain he keeps alive to help him.

Igor has done something no one has ever done before. He has assembled a creature of various parts and given it life. Unfortunately inside of this creature is the essence of evil, held in check at present. Instead, Eva (Molly Shannon), his creation, is a romantic at heart and simple as can be.

While Igor is working on his creation, Dr. Schadenfreude (Eddie Izzard) is out to win once more, having won year after year. What most don't realize though is that Schadenfreude has stolen all of his ideas and this year doesn't look any different. Using a shape shifting accomplice whose has been flirting with Igor, he attempts to steal Eva and make her the ultimate weapon.

A misunderstanding results in Eva leaving Igor and heading to the lab of Dr. Schadenfreude. As he changes her from good to bad, she becomes the weapon he sought as he not only tries to win the competition but to take over the land of Malaria as well. Only Igor and his motley crew can save the day.

The production values on this film rank high. It matches those seen in films released by the Disney studio or Pixar. The animation leaves nothing lacking and all involved have done a fine job.

Fans of classic horror films will get a kick out of this one. Not only are the elements of those films seen here but some of the sets resemble them as well. And the element of mad scientist and hunchbacked assistant is visible from the first moment. It is a tribute to those classic films.

That being said, the film is marketed not to those fans so much but to children. And for some of those children the images here are not user friendly. It is less a matter of them being spooky but in being downright frightful to the mind of a 5 year old. And to have a character whose main goal is to kill himself? It might be a bit much for a young mind to completely comprehend.

Had this movie been marketed as a spoof, as a cult film, things might have been different. It is an enjoyable movie to watch. But then again I'm watching it as an adult and not as a child.

When one compares the animated output from years ago with those currently hitting screens one has to wonder where the joy in innocence went. Why are we so focused on the ugly things instead of the wonders we saw as children? Even the evil Queen in SLEEPING BEAUTY had a certain amount of elegance and beauty to her. And while that queen turned into a dragon and was slain, there wasn't the same sort of ugly underside as witnessed in today's films.

Some would say we watched the coyote decimated by the road runner for years and it never affected us. Then again, it was never done with such detail. IGOR is a good movie. And for those willing to take the time to sit with their children and watch it, explaining the humor and consequences of certain ideas in the film, it could be a family film. But this is not one to allow children to watch on their own.",1247356800,,4118,4.368627450980392

We love Nightmare Before Christmas, but this movie is nothing like it.  In the first 15 minutes characters were beaten repeatedly, a character attempts suicide over and over again, characters are cheating to win contests, and there was some seductive and sexual behavior between two characters.  I have no idea how this movie is only rated PG.",1245628800,10,491,4.4222222222222225

3689711,3,B001LPWGFA,"The kingdom of Malaria used to be a sunny place.  Then, the clouds and the rains came....King Malbert told the kingdom the only thing they could do was start creating evil inventions and blackmailing the rest of the world not to unleash them.  Thus, next to the King himself, the Mad Scientist was at the top of the heap in the kingdom of Malaria.  Right at the bottom were the Igors--while the scientists got to keep their name, all these ubiquitous hunchbacked helpers shared the same name and the worst jobs in the kingdom.

Only one Igor (voiced by John Cusack) never forsook hope.  He decided to create life and managed to do just that behind the back of his mad scientist.  Thus, Eva was born (voiced by Molly Shannon).  Unfortunately, Eva's evil programming was faulty and she thought she was an actress.

Igor's doing his best to get Eva ready for the Mad Science Fair.  Meanwhile, Dr. Shadenfreude (v. by Eddie Izzard) and his girlfriend Jaclyn/Heidi (v. by Jennifer Coolidge) are planning on stealing Eva for their own nefarious purposes...

Of course, with the success of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""The Corpse Bride"" we've got to expect some serious dark fantasy animation to come out for the kiddies.  ""Igor"" isn't bad, it's just not good enough to compete with the abovementioned films--or 2009's ""Coraline"" for that matter.  It's too 'kiddie' for the older kids who'll watch and just not quite creepy enough.

3689726,4,B001LPWGFA,"I can see why some people hated this film, because if you bought the DVD  to keep your young children occupied, you didn't get your money's worth. 'Igor' is really for old horror buffs, but it tried to play both sides of the field. It's too adult for kids and not dark enough for adults.

The animation is very good and looks more than a little inspired by 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. The voice work isn't bad, but the film doesn't have enough inspired characters to keep the momentum going. Most of the comic relief comes from an immortal rabbit who wants to die!

Overall I think if you like old horror films and animated films you'll like 'Igor', but it will not keep the little ones interested. The DVD has an excellent transfer, but not a lot of extras. There is an alternate beginning that is interesting.",1237075200,31,817,4.506756756756757
3689727,5,B001LPWGFA,"I don't know why this movie doesn't get more positive recognition; I thought it was terrific, and I've seen most the feature-length animated films of the past several years. This holds it own against most of them.

For an animated film, it has exactly what you want: fantastic colors and colorful characters -most of them very funny and entertaining to view and hear - and a good story with some interesting twists to it. The artwork in this film is just amazing, especially on Blu-Ray. (I've discovered that's how to watch these new animated movies - in high-def, because most of them look awesome. This film certainly is no exception.) There were many times I just wanted the freeze-frame the picture and take in all the wild artwork. I might do that on a second viewing.

Also no surprise is Steve Buscemi, who always gets humorous roles in these animated films and makes everyone laugh. He usually plays a rat, too. I mentioned that to a friend and he said, ""That's because he looks like one in real life."" I wouldn't go that far, but I understand where he's coming from.

Actually, all the leading voices - Buscemi, John Cusack, Molly Shannon, Sean Hayes, John Cleese, Jay Leno and more were all great. I'll give a special nod to the voice that cracked me up more than all the others, the one of ""Hedi,"" done by Jennifer Coolidge. She was hilarious!

If you enjoy the famous Frankstein monster story, or wild characters in a monster-lab-type setting, you should enjoy this parody. It's an underrated film and looks super on Blu-Ray.",1236643200,,1537,4.681481481481481

The non-Pixar ones are usually pretty good but not up to that quality (Shrek, Over the Hedge, Madagascar, etc.), but some are not good at all in my opinion such as Madagascar 2 and Happy Feet to name a few.  It all depends on what you want out of an animated movie.  I personaly look for an engaging plot and most of all the funny one-line quips that are a staple of this genre.  The main thing for me with this movie was its originality.  The plot is really unique and there were tons of funny one-liners that I chuckled at throughout.  My kids 7 & 9 also were laughing and we watched it twice.  I had never even heard of this movie and just picked it off the shelf at Blockbuster, and I am really glad I did.  I would say this is one of the best non-Pixar animated movies I've seen.",1236470400,17,950,4.204419889502763
3689729,4,B001LPWGFA,"I'm not sure why the lukewarm reviews for this movie.  I watched it with my wife and 8 year old daughter.  If the movie is boring my daughter will not hesitate to walk out of the room:  She sat through the whole movie.  I, for one, enjoyed it.  The technical quality definitely played a role in keeping me interested.  The artwork is very ""angular"".  Not sure if anyone would consider this a problem or not.

The picture and sound, I rented the blu ray version obviously, was very nice.  A technophile might nitpick (HighDefDigest gave it 4 out of 5 stars), but I saw no serious issues.

Aside from the technical aspect, the story was engaging.  Think Tim Burton-lite; slightly twisted.  Some might call it predictable, maybe cliche, but still an enjoyable diversion.

I make it a point to rent before I buy and this is one movie that would be taken into serious consideration.

Now for the more conservative; you should be aware there is several references to suicide.  One character gets his brains blown out (albeit, this is in a comical fashion (if there is such a thing), no blood).  So be aware.

Anyway, bottom line, I think this movie did not get a fair shake.  Take 1 hour 27 minutes and make up your own mind.",1236124800,,1219,4.488584474885845

3689732,3,B001LPWGFA,"Igor came out in late 2008 and quickly died at the theaters, hence a quick trip to the DVD.  The story behind Igor is simple enough, a hunchback assistant to a mad scientist takes over for his boss once the boss dies in a lab accident.  This Igor then enters the annual monster-making competition.  In the process, he discovers more about himself, his place in life, and the origins of his society.

The story is written as a comedy with parts of romance, action and suspense thrown in.  This movie is quite original, and the cast is excellent, however the biggest failing is the unfunniness of the comedy.  Many of the cast are accomplished comedians such as Jay Leno, John Cleese, and Steve Buscemi so the cast is not to blame for the lack of humor.  I would say that this is due to the scriptwriters.  Much of the comedy occurs as side gags to the main storyline, as if somebody threw them in to try and get a rise from the audience.  Few of the supposed funny scenes advances the story.

So overall, an OK movie.  It is fine for kids, though boring probably for most kids to sit thru.",1235779200,,1088,4.36318407960199
3689733,4,B001LPWGFA,"I picked up IGOR at a discount, not knowing anything about it other than what was written on the back of the case. I love old horror movies and I love wacky comedy, so I figured it might be worth it. I've watched it three times now, enjoying it more each time. True, it gets off to a slow start. John Cusack's voice-over back-story opening is very weak. It's not particularly funny and he doesn't do it well. I almost gave up. But I'm nothing if not persistent. The result: It's a stitch! Once Eva, the monster who thinks she's an actress, takes stage, the movie picks up tremendously. There are funny situations, brilliant one-liners, great acting, clever animation. Okay, I admit it: when the message arrives (""We're all born with an evil bone. It's up to us whether or not we use it.""), it screams: MESSAGE!!! But that's okay, because the road there is paved with such great stuff. This was an indie production, so without the Pixar-type funding, it falls somewhat short of the visual brilliance of the big-studio animation films. But it's miles and miles above BARNYARD. (Hell, ANY movie is miles and miles above BARNYARD!) I don't particularly recommend this for kids. They wouldn't get through the opening and they wouldn't get 15% of the humor. But for those of us who like ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT, it's a must-see. Oh yes, there's also the wonderful voice of Jennifer Coolidge. Can't go wrong with that!",1235692800,11,1478,4.710424710424711

There are three signs that we've selected a good DVD:
1. The popcorn is gone.
2. No one gets out of their seat.
3. We get a request to ""watch it again"" as the credits roll.

About 30 minutes into Igor, both of my sons started fidgeting. Then, they rolled out of their seats and left the room, wandering into the kitchen and down the hall to their bedroom.

There were no requests for a repeat viewing.

The heart of the problem is that to appreciate this animated film you really need to have already watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein/dp/B0001CNRLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bride-of-Frankenstein/dp/B0001CNRLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bride of Frankenstein</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Frankenstein/dp/B000G6BLWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Frankenstein</a>, the latter of which mined many of these same jokes nearly 25 years ago. Most six-year olds know very little about the Frankenstein story other than to recognize the iconic makeup Boris Karloff wore.

I believe this story would work far better on the stage than as an animated film. Igor certainly could do no worse on Broadway as the stage adaptation of Shrek was cringe-inducing.

In summary, this is an animated film too clever for its own good. Without a firm understanding of the Frankenstein story, much of the dialogue (and the dry wit) will fly over the heads of young children.",1235174400,2,1756,6.004

 It is just OK in that the characters are cute and it's speedy pace is aimed at keeping kids entertained, but it isn't smart with kid appropriate adult humor like Toy Story. My husband and I tried to watch it to the end but couldn't make it. My 8 year old daughter fell asleep but made the effort to finish it later. Her review was it was ""It was O.K.

And the answer? Not awful. No, it's too dull and boring to be awful.

The stellar cast does its best with a mediocre (at best) script.  And the animation design is interesting, even if it is pretty much a shiny rip-off of the style of Nightmare Before Christmas (the king in this looks uncannily like the mayor in Nightmare, without any of the cleverness).

In this film, in the village of Malaria- storm clouds ruined their crops generations ago so the villagers needed another form of income. King Malbert offers the Mad Science Fair to the people to fix that problem. Each year, evil scientists put forth their best devilish creations and those creations fight it out to see who wins.  Then the King will ransom the world NOT to unleash the winner on them. In Malaria, there are lots of Igors to those mad scientists. An Igor to Dr. Glickenstein wants to rise above his task of pulling the switch for the Doctor by creating life on his own. Which he does in the form of Brian and Scamper. Igor gets his big opportunity when the mad doctor blows himself up. Igor creates Eva.  He wants her to be the most evil creation ever, but she is gentle-hearted and only wants to be an actress(thanks to Brian's Brain-washing, lol). Dr. Schadenfeude gets wind that Igor may have created the winning entry for the year with Eva so he makes it his mission to steal Eva from Igor, win the fair, and boot Malbert out as King of Malaria. That's when the fun begins. The movie, itself, is told in a Tim Burtonesque style with tons of references to horror movies and laughs in the old Munsters or The Addams Family Style.
