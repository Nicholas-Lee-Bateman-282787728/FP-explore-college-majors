The vedic hymns, shlokas and the music are very effective and beyond words. A superb master piece from Shyam Benegal; a must for every Indian family and their non-Indian friends!",1317686400,,496,6.765625
4504229,4,B004Z0T0H0,"My 12-year-old son loved Zokkomon, which was aimed squarely at his age group. A sort of Karate Kid-meets-Zorro, Jr., this Disney Channel-style feature concerns a small, superstitious village under the corrupt thumb of a greedy despot, whose adopted nephew (shades of Harry Potter) becomes a ghostly superhero that spurs the children into action and helps lead the adults into realizing the truth.

This film, which is presented in Hindi with optional English subtitles, could easily be dubbed and shown on Disney XD. Might be a little creepy for very small children, though. The songs in this film were a blend of off- and on-camera singing but they still seem to make sense and add to the narrative.",1314230400,5,700,4.982905982905983

8449165,5,B004Z0T0H0,"Disney has a world cinema sector that delivers foreign language family entertainment and opens the vista of extraordinary stories about other cultures and traditions which continue to define life in other nations forming our world.  Zokkomon is an outstanding example of that world cinema collection.  The setting is India, and portrays an ordinary boy who is living in despair and poverty, but rises to be able to overcome extraordinary challenges as a fictional superhero of action-packed adventures.  Darsheel Safaryl is superb as a boy for the star role of Kunal who is an orphan.  Kunal is pushed into a cruel reality when he is suddenly abandoned by his vicious Uncle.  Anupam Kher acts in the role of the cruel Uncle.  Although Kunal is abandoned to fend for himself, the boy discovers the hero within himself and begins the journey of super hero transformations and morphs into Zokkomon.  With the location and setting of the Hindu culture, Zokkomon flies, soars and becomes another beloved hero in the world among others.  The real benefit of this movie, is it is produced by the people of India, and the actors are from several sectors of the Hindu society of India.  This is another masterpiece for family viewing to learn about other people in the world!",1482537600,,1266,4.933962264150943

8449172,3,B004Z0T0H0,"Even tho the concept of a 14 yo ""iron man"" was a cool idea from Disney, the movie was very disappointing, more story, bad comedy, than action, I expected this ""superhero"" to do more than just float and talk in a harsh voice, it lacks action, maybe i expected more from Disney,at less than $10.00 Im glad the price was such that i don't feel i wasted my money.",1340841600,,359,4.217391304347826
8449173,5,B004Z0T0H0,Very reasonably priced. I borrowed this from the library several times.  This copy was even better including a 5 minute featurette about the making of this film.  Very pleased with this purchase.,1335830400,,195,5.0625
