2338066,3,B0009YA3S6,This was a gift for a friend who is a Red Skelton fan.  I cann't review it more than that.,1313280000,,90,3.5
2338067,5,B0009YA3S6,"""Red"" has been my most purchased comedian!!  I just have to laugh, even with some dvd I've viewed 10+ times.
This dvd was another great value for me.  Delivered and quality as advertised.  Thanks!!",1306972800,,197,4.735294117647059
2338068,2,B0009YA3S6,Skelton was a funny man. The selections used on this set are not his best. But it does give you an idea about this funny guy.,1294617600,3,125,3.8461538461538463
2338069,5,B0009YA3S6,"For us who remember this wonderful man, what can i say but, he is still the best to watch.  Slapstick is so funny,,,there is no violence or cussing or sex,,,just an exceptionally talented man who could make anyone and everyone laugh.  His characters are a great work of imagination !!  This is real tv and comedy at its best.  Yeah its old,,,but it sure is a breath of fresh air from what is going on today.  Try it,,,you will love it.",1244505600,16,435,4.320987654320987
2338070,5,B0009YA3S6,I bought this for my Mom and Dad. She called me a few days later and told me she really enjoyed it. I'll probably buy other similar items now.,1232236800,5,142,3.9310344827586206
2338071,2,B0009YA3S6,"I know there are many, many more episodes of Red Skelton that were much funnier than the ones they put on this dvd. I was really disappointed in the ones that were selected for this package. I gave it to my dad for a gift, and watched it with him. Some of them were okay, but I know Red Skelton is hilarious, but they didn't do his show justice on this dvd package.",1230336000,13,365,4.013698630136986
2338072,4,B0009YA3S6,"My DVD came late, too late for a xmas gift, but it was resent so the effort was definately there.  It is a gift for V Day now so I don't know what shape it is in yet, though the cover looks fine.",1230336000,,195,3.5348837209302326
2338073,4,B0009YA3S6,"Even growing up in Australia when we were restricted in a lot of the early TV programs, we still yearned for the 'older' comedians, Red Skelton being one of them. Although these discs have been edited, there is still the classic comedy of the man and his guests, the spontaneous 'ad-libs' which had my family and myself crying with laughter. I recommend it to others.",1229385600,10,367,4.661538461538462

8070246,1,B0009YA3S6,only one of the two cds in the box,1405036800,,34,2.888888888888889
8070247,3,B0009YA3S6,But slightly disappointed in the selection of the character vignettes chosen for this 2-disc edition.  Not great quality of film either. But I guess I can't complain - price was right.,1365724800,,184,4.935483870967742
8070248,3,B0009YA3S6,"Red Skeleton is still great, but this disc was advertised as being Closed-captioned. Since my wife is deaf, she is going to miss all of the clever dialogue. But, at least Red Skeleton is also quite visually humorous.",1361145600,,216,4.7105263157894735
8070249,5,B0009YA3S6,"I always love Red Skelton, like to grab up any Red dvd's I can find! The price wasn't bad either.",1359849600,,97,3.9

8070251,5,B0009YA3S6,"Gave his to my son for his birthday, along with Red Skektons Bloopers, Blunders and ad libs. He really enjoyed them.
I would  recommend friends and family",1355184000,,154,4.703703703703703
8070252,5,B0009YA3S6,"Red Skelton is a classic comedian.  He was able to create characters of the 50's that everyone could imagine being very real.  He was able to make you laugh without using any 4 letter words.  He always ended his shows with, ""Thank You and may God Bless"".
Red Skelton is truly ""family"" entertainment.",1333843200,,299,4.60377358490566
