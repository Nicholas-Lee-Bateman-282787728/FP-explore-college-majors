2016063,4,B0001MBG14,"For the life of me, I can not understand why my kids loved this movie so much.  This poor dog suffered terribly and brought bad luck to all who encountered it.  I considered burning this tape after about 15 viewings, but I knew I would be forced to purchase another copy.  Finally, I doubt there is a movie I have seen more times and enjoyed less.  My kids on the other hand,  15 years later still love this movie.  What were they thinking?",1173052800,2,440,4.240963855421687

8014783,5,B0001MBG14,I loved this movie when I was little. My mom went to seven different stores to find it for me. Now I would kill to have a copy I can actually watch. A copy of Scruffy for my collection would be fabulous!,1330560000,,203,3.857142857142857

8014786,5,B0001MBG14,"Scruffy, for Best Actress. This movie is amazing and made me who I am today. It is so depressing, yet uplifting, and evokes emotions like no other movie ever made. I hate the part when Dutchess gets shot, it leaves me choked up everytime. I am 19 now and recommend any parent to buy this movie for their kid, nay, any human to buy this movie for themself.

8014787,5,B0001MBG14,I used to watch this movie non stop when i was younger. I finally found it and shared it with my 3 year old cousin. I'm 21 now and I love it just as much as I did when I was little. I didn't realize how much it taught me about caring for animals. No wonder I'm such a sucker for helping them. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a child or an adult for that matter.,1233878400,5,373,3.7341772151898733
