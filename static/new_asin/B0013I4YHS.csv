8251096,5,B0013I4YHS,"At the end of the day--you start with 6 sheets of paper and end with 6 origami sculptures. I guess it would have been more ""pretty"" to use origami paper... or the music could have been better... or showing the end result before creating the sculpture--would have been [nice] too... but do not get hung up on the noise! (i.e., how the video should have been edited)!

This is my advice and recommendation...
I recommend this video because it shows you how to apply your knowledge and skill into creating a piece of art.  That is what matters.

This video shows you how to create new and different art. Furthermore, I would say... Get the video... follow the instructions and [practice] making these paper art pieces. My first sculpture was okay, my second was better and the third was great looking.

If origami was simple it would not be fun, challenging and creative.  This video is worth seeing...It is worth it--definetly.",1287705600,,925,4.720496894409938
8251097,1,B0013I4YHS,"This is a good Origami video to SKIP.  The guy uses a piece of regular copy paper not too precisely cut into a square.  The first thing he's supposed to be telling you is how to make a (rectangular) piece of paper square.  But he doesn't really show how you do it, he shows that he did it and shows the piece he cut off.  How about just demonstrating how it's done?  It's not that hard to do.  I also think they could have used actual origami paper, preferably with a color on one side because that makes it easier for a beginner to see what to do.  Like the first reviewer, I did not (could not) watch the entire video.  He described the steps in the projects as ""Fold this, like this, then fold it this way"".  He did not actually describe what he was doing at all.  And at times as he was basically telling you to watch what he was doing, because he surely wasn't going to tell you what he was doing, he blocked your view of the paper with his hand.  Yes, incredibly he tried to demonstrate what to do but did not allow the audience to see it.  He really seemed confused and unfamiliar with what he was trying to do.  Another strange thing about this video is that demonstrator began the instructions for several items by starting out with a paper that already had several folds in it.  No clue how he got it that way.  And finally I found it quite annoying that there was no depiction of what the completed object would look like.  One item was a ""spinner"".  I still don't have any idea what kind of spinner it was because that would have required looking at his demonstration and I just couldn't bear any more.  There are good Origami DVDs for beginners.  This isn't one of them.  ""Origami Fun for Kids, Too!"" is a much, much better piece of work and I would recommend that you look at that one instead of this one.",1272153600,3,1819,4.217391304347826
8251098,1,B0013I4YHS,"I have to admit I have not watched the whole DVD so this review may not be entirely fair.  This is so awful, you are torn between laughter and utter disbelief.  The folder (you just see his hands) seems nonplussed most of the time and cannot even make sense of his own work.  The ""music"" overwhelms the ""narration"", and you are left with a pair of hands fiddling around with a wrinkled up piece of paper that does eventually turn into a ""box"", which looks as if it has been through a series of distress tests. This is a funny DVD and if I watch the rest of it someday and have to eat my words, I will gladly do so.",1270166400,6,614,4.0578512396694215
