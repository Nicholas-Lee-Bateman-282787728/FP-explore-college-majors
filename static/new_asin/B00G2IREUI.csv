6044941,4,B00G2IREUI,"I have been a Kirk Cameron fan since my tween years when Mike Seaver was the man of my dreams! We have definitely both grown up a lot since then and I continued to follow his career and was thrilled as a fellow Christian when his life took the path that it did. Instead of focusing on the secular industry where he could make a lot more money, Cameron has dedicated his life and career to spreading the gospel and using his God given talents for Gods glory instead of his own.

Unstoppable is a personal project inspired by the loss of a young life that brought into question the same one that we all have asked: why does God allow bad things to happen to good people? A high school friend recently lost a young child and my husbands cousin lost her husband at such a young age leaving behind four children. Holding my newborn baby and thinking of all the fears that mothers of little ones have, I have asked myself the same question over the past several weeks many times. This movie came at a time when I needed to see it.

It is very raw and Cameron is extremely open and bears his heart and soul. The first fifteen minutes were very emotional and dark and drew me right into the story of his friends child that died. I wanted to hear the answers and know his version of why God allows these things to happen.

He takes us back to the begin inning and the original sin. It is almost done like a documentary and there is a lot of imagery while he tells stories from the Bible. This would be great for new believers or non believers that don't know all of the Bible stories. I will admit, I got a little bored at moments just because they are all stories Ive heard a thousand times before. I can see the need for the history for those that don't know it, but for those that do it was a bit dry, even if it was being told by Kirk Cameron!

He goes through the history of the Bible and tells man of the stories about pain and suffering and Gods hand in it all. Its very moving at times when dealing with the loss of his friend but slow at others with all of the history and imagery and music that relaxed me a little too much!

Unstoppable is moving and has beautiful images that would be great for those that are new to faith or don't believe at all. Cameron obviously knows his Bible and has wisdom to impart. He isn't just another actor. He lives what he preaches and believes it to his core and his faith and heart shine through.",1390867200,77,2432,4.176972281449894
6044942,5,B00G2IREUI,"I was really excited when the opportunity arose for me to review UNSTOPPABLE.  This was a movie I really wanted to add to our family movie collection.  This movie started out with Kirk talking about his friend who passed away from cancer.  Everyone was asking, ""Why does God let bad things happen?""  Then it goes on talking about a few of the good and bad stories of the bible:  Adam and Eve vs The Serpent and Cain vs Abel.  This film is mostly Kirk doing the talking and when he is talking you can see how much passion he has. While he is talking about the stories, it actually goes to a visual to help you see what the Bible is saying.  Some of the scenes made me think, that was a little weird, but that's the way it works.  One person can see something one way and someone else can vision something else but it is the same thing.
This movie I could watch with my older son, I think he would get it and understand it, but it's too old for my younger two.
I received this movie free for review.  All opinions are my own!",1390435200,140,1023,4.126262626262626

I'm sure he's capable of doing better.  It just seemed all over the place.  But, again, I would watch anything he brings out because he loves the Lord and has such a passion to spread the good news!

6044970,4,B00G2IREUI,"The story opens with the never ending question that plagues mankind, ""Why does God allow suffering"". Kirk Cameron begins with what looks like a good essay of the question but in the process he felt necessary to recall the story since creation without ever actually answering the question. Every Christian has their own opinion as to the answer to the question and Kirk doesn't really do a very good job and getting his opinion across. This is not to say the video doesn't have merits because it does.  You see Kirk Cameron as a authentic Christian who is bothered by the things that bother us all. It is a well made video with outstanding music which is really the best part of the presentation.  I watched it on Netflix and would pass on purchasing it.",1463788800,,753,4.57037037037037

6044985,5,B00G2IREUI,"Loved this movie!  Kirk is on a mission to make sense of why bad things happen to good people and I think he nails it.  I grew up with him as my idol and had his posters on my wall.  Now I'm an adult and can still look at him as a role model, but in a whole different sense of the word.  He's a godly man with a heart to further God's kingdom.  The film is more or less a documentary that takes on the tough questions of how can God allow pain and suffering to His own people.  Educational, inspirational, and worth recommending!  Thanks for another great one, Kirk!",1450051200,,566,4.045045045045045

I have also been a Kirk Carmeron fan since my tween years when Kirk was the man of my dreams! Still is! We have definitely both grown up a lot since then and I continued to follow his ""career"" and was thrilled as a fellow Christian when his life took the path that it only could. Now, I know he's married but I hope she can be openminded to loving more than one person. I could be his ""guy on the side"" and she wouldn't even have to know about it. We could fulfill different holes in his life.

I don't mind about the toupee and his face is very small for his head, but I think it works.",1448841600,,644,3.9461538461538463

6044989,4,B00G2IREUI,Really enjoyed it. Was based on the Bible with dramatization  from it. If you are expecting a movie then this is NOT for you. This is a discussion on Bible theology and includes a true story about someone Kirk Cameron knows.,1447632000,,224,4.463414634146342
6044990,5,B00G2IREUI,"Excellent movie. It is made like a documentary but better. For anyone who has ever wondered why do bad things happen, this movie explains it. Very well done. There is one spot where Cain kills Abel that is a little graphic but other than that it is family friendly.  I highly recommend it.",1446681600,,289,4.452830188679245
6044991,1,B00G2IREUI,I actually watched this and I'm quite convienced that Kick is a lunatic. I can't see how anyone would believe that this is how life started on earth. The whole thing doesn't even make any sense. Grow a brain people.,1445731200,4,215,4.4

6045003,1,B00G2IREUI,"I think Kirk Cameron is genuine and brave, and a wonderful Christian and family man. I have so much respect for him.

I can't share in the high praise of my fellow reviewers with this one. For one thing, parts of this came across very strange to me. There were these long, highly dramatized scenes from the bible. Satan was a man, yet he looked like a snake--just weird. The scene where he tries to pitch the story of Noah and the flood was weird too. Not sure what that was supposed to mean. It was also a bit inaccurate to me at times. He put all the blame for the fall on Adam. Maybe Eve doesn't deserve all of it, but she should get some of it. There were other things he said that struck me as just plain wrong too. He gave this weird explanation for the rainbow being a bow aimed at heaven. Not sure where he got that. There were other things that struck me as not quite right when I watched it that I can't remember now. All I can say is, I would not recommend this to anyone.",1429401600,,1019,4.125628140703518

6045019,4,B00G2IREUI,"This video journal begins by asking a tough question ""Why does God allow bad thing to happen to good people?""  He uses one families tragic loss of a young son from cancer as an example. He gets down to the fundamentals of original sin and why Jesus came and died for our sins as a basis for answering his question. He discusses God's amazing grace and mercy  towards some pretty horrible people and it does remind us all how God has extended His mercy towards us too.

6045046,2,B00G2IREUI,"Although Kirk Cameron presents a nice a feel good message, I felt it fell short of answering the question in depth. If you cut half the movie scene with the artsy-fartsy camera work, the remaining 30 mins are basically Kirk Cameron having coffee and putting his own spin on the Adam and Eve and Noah accounts. I would have liked more biblical basis to attempt to answer such an age old question (""If God is good, why do people suffer""). If you are christian, the answer should be pretty obvious, and can be summarized in one sentence. The hard part is providing evidence and making a case for it, which I felt this movie lacked.",1415059200,3,628,4.469565217391304

I feel sorry for him and the judgement this movie will bring to his head.  He has changed the word and chronological order of things, and I honest had to turn it off.  I will be deleting this one from my library, it is an abomination against God.  I advise anyone that doesn't have a deep understanding of the bible, and up on the Word to avoid this movie like a plague; it will confuse you, and possible bring you to sin against God if you don't understand his errors.  He speculates on things that should never be speculated upon, except by people that dedicate their lives to serving God night and day; and the speculation will never contaminate them cause they are so deeply with God.  Lets be honest, that is so very few people in this world.  So trust me this is a very bad thing he has done.",1413072000,4,947,4.245810055865922

6045066,3,B00G2IREUI,"Let me start by sating I love Kirk Cameron.  I love his acting, his ministry, his family values, etc.  That being said, this movie was kind of disappointing.  The premise of the movie is to answer the question of why do bad things happen to good people.  Unfortunately, Kirk never really gets there.  He does a great overview of major catastrophes from the bible, somehow associates noah's rainbow with Jesus (which I still don't understand) and concludes.... what?  I'm not really sure.  All in all, although his stories were interesting, it really didn't go anywhere.  However, the best part of the movie is the soundtrack.  The music is awesome!!!",1409529600,,650,4.889908256880734
6045067,4,B00G2IREUI,"I appreciate Kirk Cameron's stand for faith and Christian beliefs.  The content is Biblically sound and well presented, however, the incessant jumpy edits were a bit annoying.",1409443200,,175,5.481481481481482
6045068,2,B00G2IREUI,"This movie was very, very slow. Overly long pauses with no dialogue. Lots of music and slow-motion images. Seemed like ""filler"" to me. About 85% of the movie focuses in detail on the Old Testament, with the remaining 15% on Christ. The movie puts more emphasis on the problem than the solution. For me, this film definitely did not answer the question of ""Why do good things happen to bad people?"". Left me feeling empty and no more enlightened after watching. Did not strengthen my faith as I had hoped it would. Truly disappointing. Still love Kirk though. Great man.",1409270400,6,569,4.7
6045069,1,B00G2IREUI,"Unstoppable is embarrassing and insulting to watch. It just confirms the massive control Christianity has on its followers. An uneducated film, based solely on human emotion offers no sort of logical answer to such a heart breaking question.
I was not expecting some genius answer from this film. I expected exactly what was delivered. A simple man who cannot explain human suffering- but encourages ""believers"" to trust in Gods plan. So sad, why not make a film about mental health- moving through the stages of grief, or building communal bonds...something attainable and positive for everyone.",1409097600,7,596,5.28421052631579

However, the documentary style of it is not complimented by the dragging of Kirk speaking and preaching through out. It seems to drag on forever before making any sustainable points. I couldn't bring myself to get all the way through it. I may give another attempt to watch it through before giving up on it, but am definitely a little disappointed.",1405900800,6,520,4.602150537634409

6045082,4,B00G2IREUI,"I enjoyed this film. I expected Kirk to stay a little more on subject however. Even in his Adam and Eve story he said that Adam just stood by and watched Eve eat the fruit ""as the story goes"". The Bible never said that Adam stood by or that he was even present when Eve was deceived. Thus he blamed Adam for not protecting Eve. Had be been the protector he was supposed to be she never would have eaten of the fruit, as Kirk says.
That aside the cinematography was a bit amateurish. And the part where Kirk is trying to sell the story of Noahs flood to movie producers was drawn out and unnessesary.",1405468800,,599,4.172413793103448

6045091,5,B00G2IREUI,"I really enjoyed this DVD, As many times as I have read Genesis I had not caught on to the fact that God had given Adam the duty to ""Guard the garden"" which implies there was something for Adam to guard it from.

6045092,3,B00G2IREUI,"I was a little surprised with this movie. After a short time one of our kids left and I think the other stayed hoping it would get better. I guess it's not really a movie in the sense of a movie. Probably more of a documentary with a story feel. I think the main plot line was a funeral that was interrupted with events from the Bible accompanied by music. Then Kirk would talk a little and it would go back to the funeral. I was so lost by the story line that I missed any message, if there was one.",1402790400,,500,3.9603960396039604

As another reviewer mentioned, it is very slow at times, very drawn out at times, and kind of ""dark"".  It had the feel of a weird music video at times.  Kirk would speak a bit telling the story of creation and God's redemption (which was good), then it would be followed by a long music video type depiction of what he had just said (which we did not like at all).  It was like some theater major wanted to make an artsy film for his senior project.  As far as apologetic films and resources go, there are much better resources out there.  I don't think this film would appeal to a non-believer and would hesitate using it as an apologetic or evangelistic tool.",1402531200,5,746,4.323741007194244

6045096,1,B00G2IREUI,"Ok so I got this DVD today and I was really looking forward to watching it. I was very disappointed in the DVD. It is basically narrated by Kirk, which wasn't a bad thing, it was just a little drawn out on some things. I'll just number the issues I had with it and leave it at that.

1. He blamed Adam for not protecting Eve in the garden, and since Adam didn't do his manly obligation of protecting Eve it was mans fault she ate the fruit. This in fact goes against what 1 Timothy 2:14 says ""and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.""

2. The movie was suppose to be about why God allows bad things to happen to us. He never really answered this question.

3. He basically says at the end of the movie that God allows people to die or have issues and that is the way things are. His main thing is the death of a boy he knew and how his family were very faithful and that God allowed the boy to die to benefit someone else. I disagree with this completely. Mat 10:8  Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. Jesus commands us to do these things.

4. He also states that God is the driver of this adventure in life we are having and that we are just along for the ride. This is basically saying we don't have a say at all in our lives. So if God is at the wheel then the fall of man would never of happened in my opinion. The better explanation would be we are behind the wheel and God is next to us saying ""I am here with you the entire way.  Just ask and I will be there for you.""

These are just a few things I noticed about the movie that I disagree with.",1402099200,38,1620,3.9814814814814814
6045097,2,B00G2IREUI,"I love Kirk Cameron....his work and his message. However, Unstoppable was slow and drawn out at times more than was needed to convey the story and it  was heavy and dark in the delivery.

6045109,2,B00G2IREUI,"This production From Kirk Cameron was once a ""one-time screening"" out in theaters last year (2013) and I had heard such rave reviews about it when it came out on DVD. I was more than a bit disappointed with what it is. It's more like a documentary and not a movie, per se. The pace is unquestionably at a snail's slowest gait. ""Acting"" (in the form of vignettes between Kirk's yammering and studdering around) isn't at all what a person would expect from a ""movie"" - at least for me. Yes. The content is true to form - if you know your Bible.  But ""a fantastic 'movie'?"" Nope.

'Sorry, Kirk. I like your acting in other films - but this isn't a ""film."" Stick with acting and leave the directing & production to someone else!",1398902400,9,724,4.355555555555555

6045129,5,B00G2IREUI,"I had some friends over for movie night and all three of us really enjoyed this movie.  It was a narrative, which we were not expecting, but it was well done and showed Kirk Cameron's faith journey after the loss of a friends young son.  I recommend it.",1395014400,,253,4.25
6045130,5,B00G2IREUI,"Recommend bringing an open heart and mind when you watch this film.  Tackles some of life's toughest questions.  Many of these questions, many folks don't want to think about (terminal disease, death, suffering etc.) until they are hit in the face with them.

What is wonderful about watching the film is that it brings potential hope and answers for those who are will to consider these issues honestly.

Would highly recommend sharing Unstoppable with any family or friends who are going through cancer or other painful life trials.",1395014400,,534,5.034090909090909

My only criticism is for those who cannot see or understand the meaning of this movie or don't understand how it answered the initial question Kirk opens the movie up with. Pretty simple, really. Open your Bible to John 3:16. This has always summed it up pretty succinctly for me. God is good. Thank you for making this movie, Kirk.",1394755200,,494,4.823529411764706

6045134,2,B00G2IREUI,"My husband and I watched this and were very disappointed. The original question never gets answered. Although we have our own answer to the question, which really is not a simple answer because of so many factors, those who watch this hoping to get an answer are left high and dry. We would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who do not know Jesus Christ. Gave it two stars for the ""ok"" story telling style.",1394582400,9,425,4.532467532467533

6045140,1,B00G2IREUI,"Showed this to a group of 12 Christians, the majority being well studied in Scripture.  Though mostly Scripturally sound this 65 minute DVD was dragged out through extended pointless shots of Kirk doing nothing. All in the group were put off by the weird imagery and loud music that served only to sensationalize the story not enhance it. Most in the group seemed to struggle to follow Kirk's point which ended up being very different that the synopsis on the case would lead you to expect.  Perhaps the sensationalism on this DVD speaks to the younger generation and breaks through their desensitized responses but a 50 and above group just found it disturbing and even boring.",1393200000,27,678,4.836206896551724

6045142,2,B00G2IREUI,"I was very disappointed, The way Kirk Cameron lead us to believe was we would get an explanation of why bad things happen to good people and the question would be answered why doesn't the Lord stop bad things.

The word of God says, ""It will rain on the just and unjust"".

I love Mr. Cameron and appreciate him, however this was a big flop.",1392249600,5,340,4.2153846153846155
6045143,2,B00G2IREUI,"Normally, I'm into whatever movies Kirk Cameron is in as they're usually good, but this one left me and others feeling like it needed some massive work.

For starters, throughout the entire movie, there are scenes where Kirk is talking and then you'll see a blip where they clearly edited the scene as he continues talking onwards. It's very distracting and takes away from the movie.

Secondly, the biblical scenes from the Bible such as Genesis, Noah, etc were rather dragged out. I'm growing frustrated that we're always hearing of these famous stories, but rarely on the REST of the stories in the Bible. They were included too for a reason. I understand where Kirk was going with it, but they were too dragged out and some of the music was off putting as well.

Thirdly, the entire movie just felt choppy and while Kirk tries his best to answer the question, ""Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people?"", I don't personally feel like he answered it well.",1391558400,8,972,4.6395348837209305
6045144,5,B00G2IREUI,"I really enjoyed this, but as a mom, I just wanted to give a ""head's up"" that there are some parts (mainly the story of Cain and Abel) that are very graphic and not for young children.",1391385600,3,184,4.0
6045145,5,B00G2IREUI,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Unstoppable  -- I only knew I was very curious how Kirk Cameron was going to answer the difficult and complex question of why God allows tragedy in our lives. He told the story of a young boy who died after battling cancer for 10 years. This is the story the movie opens with, and from there Kirk takes you an a journey to understand why God allows sufferings.

I really enjoyed the movie. It was put together very well and in such a way that was really eye-catching and kept your attention till the very end. I wasn't a fan of all the music used in this film -- especially when they reenact Cain killing Abel. It got really loud and and hard. I'm not familiar with what rock music sounds like (don't listen to it), but it made me think of this music genre.

I thought Kirk did a fabulous job at answering this unanswerable question. We can't know or understand some things -- like this question -- until we are with the Lord in heaven. There are some things that are just to vast and deep for our minds to wrap around. But in Unstoppable , Kirk took his viewers back to the beginning -- into the Garden of Eden -- and showed what a merciful God we serve and how much we, humans, have failed and do not deserve His grace.

It was a really good, refreshing presentation of the gospel -- a great reminder of what a merciful and powerful God I serve! I really appreciate the way Kirk started from the beginning and went all the way to the Cross. If someone has never heard the true Gospel message before, they will get a very thorough presentation of it in Unstoppable .

The movie had several special features, teasing at the projects that Kirk Cameron is currently working on. they all sound great and I can't wait to find out more information about them in the months ahead. If you've ever experienced a personal loss in your life or have pondered this age-old question before, I would highly encourage you to get this DVD. You won't regret watching it, and it may just change your outlook on things.

I reviewed this DVD for FlyBy Promotions - special thanks to Laura for setting this up! It was not required that I give a positive review, but solely to express my own thoughts and opinions of this DVD, which I have done.",1391385600,61,2257,4.3364928909952605
6045146,4,B00G2IREUI,"Going into this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect, but Ive always been impressed by the films in which Kirk Cameron has been involved. I was also intrigued by the topic covered  Where is God in the midst of tragedy and suffering?  as I believe this is one of the most asked questions by people when it comes to God. Every time a tragedy strikes  especially on a large scale  this question seems to come to the forefront.

Kirk Camerons young friend, Matthew Sandgren, finally lost his battle with cancer which cut Kirk to the core. Matthews family and friends knew that he was in a better place and no longer suffering. Yet, his death, his suffering beg the question as to why he had to get cancer in the first place and why he had to eventually succumb to it rather than defeat it. In other words, why do bad things happen to good people.

Kirk takes us back to the beginning, the very beginning, to where the world was first created by God. We follow along as visually as sin enters the world through Adam and Eve. Kirks story is part documentary about Matthew, his family and friends, and its part dramatization of Biblical events. Some of the events are covered in a less than traditional way  such as Satan being shown as a man rather than a serpent, but the dramatization is very thought-provoking.

There are some scenes that may not be suitable for young children  Cain killing Able and the resulting blood is one of them, but these topics are important to the information being presented. Parents may want to preview the video as they know their children best when it comes to what they can and can not handle.

Unstoppable tackles the difficult topic of suffering and death within the domain of a living God. It does a nice job of laying out the reasons behind why there is suffering and death in this world. It also presents the salvation message within the telling of Matthews life and death. Kirk is very passionate about the topic, and his love for Christ and the Sandgrens is quite evident.

6045147,5,B00G2IREUI,"Kirk Cameron uses the scripture to illustrate God's providences and power in the wake of loss and suffering. From creation and through the book of Genesis, Mr. Cameron takes the viewer through many of God's promises, as well as the rich foundation of our faith.

The movie was well done with artistic re-enactments and representations, all the while being narrated by Mr. Cameron who spoke in an enthusiastic conversational way.

This movie illustrates God's Unstoppable will, and how even through the tough times, and the pain of this world God is working out His powerful Unstoppable plan.

A great movie, with a powerful message.",1391385600,2,632,5.0576923076923075
6045148,4,B00G2IREUI,"My husband and I just finished watching Unstoppable, an independent film  narrated by actor Kirk Cameron. Struggling himself with the age-old question of why do bad things happen to good people, Kirk attempts to offer hope to those who suffer. Beginning with the creation story and ending with the resurrection Kirk illustrates the consequences of mans rebellion and sin through history.

Kirks passion for Christ and his drive to share Gods truth with others and to encourage them in their Christian walk is evident throughout the entire film. Personal stories are interspersed with Biblical examples in this relatively short documentary. Kirks emotions were apparent as he described the death of a young friend that inspired the making of this film. I felt that Kirk was both eloquent and concise with his message.

Kirk may or may not have answered the question to everyones satisfaction but we felt that his conjectures were valid and encouraging as well as thought provoking. Watching this DVD with a group could be an excellent springboard for discussion.

6045149,5,B00G2IREUI,"Those familiar with the Left Behind series and Fireproof will certainly remember the faith displayed by Kirk Cameron! Husband, father, actor, writer, producer, he wears many coats but the one he shines most is as Christian. There is little doubt this is a man who believes what he says and practices what he preaches.

About his latest project he says:
"" It's easy to get excited about your faith when things are going well in your life. But when your whole world comes crashing down on you, the questions start:
Where is God when I need him most?
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Unstoppable is a journey, based on a true story, that has become the most personal and transparent project I have ever made regarding my faith.""

In a nutshell Unstoppable was inspired by the death of 15 year old Matt who battled cancer for 10 years.
Kirk Cameron had no idea where this particular journey would lead him when he decided to record the young football player's funeral in Bison, South Dakota - population 373 - but he knew in his heart he wanted to share with others this moment.

Part documentary/memorial Unstoppable follows the family and close friends as they say goodbye to this brave young man, their pain and suffering incredibly dignified and their faith unequivocal.

Kirk Cameron is at his best as he goes back to the very beginning, showing us the very origin of good versus evil beginning with the stories of Adam and Eve and then Cain and Abel.

Unstoppable is unlike any other movie, alternating betwixt the memorial service and Kirk Cameron's firm belief that God is always with us despite unbearable trials. In the end, God answers all prayers but in His time!

Endorsed by well known Dobson of Focus on the Family and others, with a special song 'The Time Is Now' by Warren Barfield guaranteed to have you humming to his tune, Unstoppable is a testimony to the power of love, understanding God and finally unshakable faith.

Including special features and Cameron's future projects, this is one DVD you should check out and share with others!

6045150,4,B00G2IREUI,"At first I wasn't sure I would like Kirk Cameron's visual documentary since I'm not a fan of most documentaries! However, after several minutes, I could start to see how the story was coming together. Kirk does an awesome job bringing to life the story of Man's beginning on earth to the death of Christ and God's redemptive power over evil! Scenes appear throughout the visual journal of the celebration of life of a young 15 year old family friend. Kirk uses this tragedy together with the Biblical stories to help us understand ""where is God in the midst of death and suffering?"" I'm glad I decided to watch the whole story. It helped me remember that God uses everything for his good and he is always with us, even during times of sickness and death!

6045151,5,B00G2IREUI,"About the DVD:
Inspired by the death of Camerons close friend who succumbed to cancer at the age of 15, Kirk Cameron takes viewers on an inspiring and hope-filled visual journey to better understand the biggest doubt-raising question in faith: Where is God in the midst of tragedy and suffering?
Going back to the beginningliterallyKirk investigates the origins of good and evil and how they impact our lives  and our eternities. UNSTOPPABLE will prompt audiences to consider the role that pain and suffering has in our lives, as they affirm their personal views on faith, and encourage conversation starters about God, suffering, and hope.
In theaters for only two weeknights (Sept 24th and Oct 3th, 2013), UNSTOPPABLE: A Live Event with Kirk Cameron sold a staggering 260,000 tickets and reached a theatrical gross of over $3.2 million dollars. In just two nights this independent project sent a loud message  audiences want thought-provoking and meaningful entertainment.

About the Author:
Kirk Cameron is best known for his memorable role as Mike Seaver, a cultural icon of the 80's, with his mullet hairstyle, cool glasses, and wisecracking comebacks. More recently he enjoyed much success with the No. 1 grossing inspirational film of 2008, Fireproof, and his recent documentary, Monumental. Kirk and his wife, Chelsea, were on-screen sweethearts during their Growing Pains years and are the founders of Camp Firefly, where terminally and seriously ill children and their families are provided an all-expense paid retreat ([...]). Together, Kirk and Chelsea live in California with their six children.

My Review:
 Life's greatest mystery is God. It seems we know so much about Him yet not enough. Kirk Cameron attacks this head on with his recently released documentary type DVD, UnStoppable. He takes a recent death of a family's friend teenage son and tries to go all the way back to creation to answer the question of why God lets death and tragedies take place when with His mighty hand he could actually prevent such things.

 Kirk takes the whole idea and expands on it but I don't think he really ever comes up with a concrete answer. I believe that it is so complex and so beyond our realm of understanding that the we will never understand this side of heaven. I also believe that sometimes God has to allow such things to happen to glorify Him in some way. Whether it be ultimate healing or a tragedy such as earthquakes or fires, He may use these terrible things to make good out of them in some way, but I refuse to believe that He would cause them to happen.
