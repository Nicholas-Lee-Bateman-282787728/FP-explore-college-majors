2270860,5,B000980GR0,"First of all, it was about time for this to come out! I was beginning to think it wasn't going to come out this year.

This is a great series very exciting, great special effects and the writing is by far better than most of SG1's first 2 seasons, sure this is because now the writers team are so familiar with the stargate universe It's easier to go on sci-fi mode for them ( I guess). Also the characters are great sure some need more developing, but hey! its just beginning and there are lots of people in atlantis, my personal favorites are Rodney and Sheppard.

I also love the fact that even though the team is in some very serious situations, the series is not horribly heavy to watch but actually has a enjoyable sence of humor and the chemistry between different characters is great.

Season 2 is doing awesome! sad is going on mid season break until january =(.

but if you buy this you can catch up on season 2 on the reruns if you haven't seen it that is.

Anyway I recommend this new series even though I refused to give it a chance when it was first aired (caught it on re-runs and loved it) Its even great for people who have never seen Sg1. I can't wait to get it and hear the commentaries specially Peter de Luis he cracks me up.

In a nutshell: "" Great series, lots of action, fun to watch, very exciting beginning, bright future and excellent second season""",1126310400,12,1376,4.293436293436294
2270861,4,B000980GR0,"After all the popularity that Stargate: SG-1 received in its first six years on the air, it was only natural that the creators would want to expand the story with a spin-off series.  As SG-1's seventh season was going on, Stargate: Atlantis was being developed.  Using a plot twist that was introduced at the end of SG-1's seventh season, Atlantis got its start.

After searching throughout the Milky Way galaxy for the fabled Lost City of the Ancients (the ancients are a very advanced race of beings that died out long ago), Stargate Command realized that it is on Earth... or at least it was.  The city, which comes to be known as Atlantis, was built on Earth millions of years ago.  The ancients, who as I said are extremely advanced, ot only made it a city, but also made it a spaceship capable of intergalactic travel.  When a great plague hit Earth, some of the ancients evacuated in Atlantis to the Pegasus galaxy, where they plan to start a civilization similar to the one that they had in the Milky Way.

Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) of SG-1 eventually finds the correct gate address to Atlantis and an international team of explorers is put together in order to go to and study Atlantis.  The expedition will be led by Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson), a civilian who was very briefly in charge of the SGC.  The Chief Science Officer is Dr. Rodney McKay (David Hewlett), a civilian who has helped out the SGC in the past, the head surgeon is Dr. Carson Beckett (Paul McGillion), a Scottish MD and biologist, and the head of military operations is hardened Col. Summner (Robert Patrick).

In order to work most ancient technology efficiently, a rare gene is required, and while Dr. Beckett has it, it isn't pronounced enough to matter.  In comes Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), a hotshot air force officer with insubordination issues.  Even though he could be a liability to the expedition, he not only has the gene, but can operate the ancient technology almost flawlessly, so he comes along as well.  The last major character is Lt. Aiden Ford (Rainbow Sun Franks), a young officer who looks up to Sheppard (and tragically was born without a personality).

Upon arrival in Atlantis, the team realizes that the power is nearly gone, and in order to survive, the city must use the electricity that was powering the defenisve shield to power life support systems.  This also means that they cannot use the gate to go back to Earth, since an intergalactic wormhole requires much more power than normal.

Soon, the team begins exploring the city (which is immense) as well as the planets in the galaxy.  On the first planet they visit, they meet Teyla (Rachel Luttrel), a young warrior woman who protects her tribe from something called the Wraith.  When Teyla learns that the visitors don't know who the Wraith are, she begs them to return to where they came from.  Soon, the Wraith show up and a lot of bad things ensue.  The Wraith are a race of beings that actually gave the ancients a good fight!  They are humanoid in build, but they are stronger, faster, and more resistant to harm than any human could hope to be.  Also, humans are their food; they literally suck the life out of people.  Fortunately for the people of the Pegasus galaxy, they only come around every half century or so (most of them hibernate for long periods of time).  Unfortunately, in an act of heroism, Sheppard accidentally causes the entire Wraith population to wake up and begin to feed all at once.

That is the pilot episode.  After that, the series becomes somewhat similar to SG-1, where Sheppard and his team go to different planets to make alliances, trade for food, and help people escape the Wraith (I will say that for such a powerful race, Sheppard and co. don't have too much trouble fighting them off).

A few story arcs develop this year.  One of them has the Atlantis expedition team get into a bitter rivalry with another advanced race of humans, which leads to an attempted coup on Atlantis.  Also, Beckett begins to study the Wraith and finds out how they came to appear human and how they were able to amass such great numbers.

I want to say that even though I'm giving this a 4 star rating, it is definitely a low 4.  The stand-alone episodes were usually moderate; some were good, some were just terrible, but on average, they were just ok.  The story-arc episodes were pretty good, and they showed that Atlantis has a lot of potential as a show.  While there will be a lot to work on, such as writing, character development, and stand-alone quality, after watching the first part of Season 2, I must say that I am very much enjoying where the series is going.  If for no other reason, this set should be watched in order to know what's going on in the later seasons, which so far, appear to be leagues ahead of this one.",1126224000,90,4847,4.610722610722611

JUST SAY NO!",1114214400,19,300,4.357142857142857
2270868,1,B000980GR0,"I hope nobody buys this item - it is clearly a bootleg. The seller has negative feedback for selling burned copies of shows. This is not an import. While it is true that the first single-disc release of Atlantis has come out in the UK, it does not look like this and is not region 1.

The real Stargate Atlantis region 1 DVDs are not due until later this year. The first release, which contains the 88-minute pilot episode ""Rising"" is due on June 7th, and the full season 1 set is due in the Fall (rumors say November.) The pilot DVD will retail for around $25 (and cost much less on Amazon) and the boxed set has a suggested retail price of $70 and will probably go for about $50 on Amazon.

Don't give your money to these pirates for shoddy burned copies.",1112227200,126,757,4.25

Watched the whole five seasons, now when I watch again I always skip the Wraith episodes, and it makes for a really nice series. Not a lot of political correctness in Atlantis except for the women's fight scenes and a bit of the phony feminist narrative.

2270889,5,B000980GR0,"Stargate Atlantis was a great series. It only lasted half as long as Stargate SG1, and didn't have the wonderful cast of Stargate SG1, but I enjoyed the series as much as the original Stargate series. I only watched a few episodes of Stargate Universe. The original Stargate series was fun and witty. Stargate Atlantis continued with the fun and wit, but Stargate Universe was dark and dumb, with an unlikeable cast.

Stargate SG1 is a great example of taking a mediocre movie, the source material, and turning it into an outstanding franchise with the longest running sci-fi series in history, although Supernatural is now the longest running fantasy series in history.

When Im not watching episodic storytelling Im reading, everything from nonfiction to westerns, but at least half of my time is spent reading sci-fi and fantasy.

Sci-fi and fantasy authors I like include Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Ray Bradbury, Orson Scott Card, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, William R. Forstchen, Joe Haldeman, Robert A.

It goes way out there in the usual ""believe the aliens"" and get sucked into big problems that safe guards to the city would have avoided.  In sci-fi they have license to do whatever they want to put more drama into it. The part where characters die and then reappear later in the series probably works with the younger people. I guess I have become to cynical in my years of dealing with the real world to believe the facts unwind that the wraith can take life or restore life.

We were already introduced to the idea of Atlantis in the SG-1 series so this was a natural development of the franchise.  Season 1 starts off full throttle with humans poking around and waking an enemy of course.  This first season also introduces the beginnings of many recurring plots (the Genii, the Hoffan drug, etc.).  Not many spin-off type shows are as enjoyable as the original and Atlantis does benefit from multiple crossover themes and original SG-1 characters; but ultimately, Atlantis can hold its own without those crutches.",1470787200,,611,4.96078431372549

I've always thought of this kind of stuff as ""Saturday afternoon"" TV because it's pleasant and relaxing, and the writing is good enough that I'm not shouting at the screen all the time.

Sure, it can be a bit corny sometimes, but it's fun, the characters are likable and it scartches that old school scifi itch.",1469923200,,489,4.556818181818182

2271276,5,B000980GR0,"One of the greatest SciFi shows of all time. I am so happy it got resurrected.

Based upon the movie 'Stargate' it closely follows the theme of the movie. Basically, teams from Earth called SG-teams travel to different worlds through a Stargate found on Earth. The show mostly follows the four members of SG-1. The shows are an hour and the team members battle some alien force or solve a critical problem somewhere. Their central Earth location is at the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force facility.

The plots are very interesting and the writing is excellent. Acting is first rate with a mix of drama and humor. The special effects are great for the time.

If you like SciFi, give SG-1 a try. I have watched all of the episodes over and over. 5 stars.",1469145600,2,747,4.559701492537314

2271279,3,B000980GR0,"Must agree with other reviewers about the editing issues - it's been a few years since I've watched the series, so it's possible that I have not noticed all of the missing scenes, but there were two that were blatantly missing to me: 1) the scene with O'Neill and Sheppard in the helicopter after Sheppard is offered a position on the expedition and 2) the scene with Elizabeth's video recording to Simon and her voiceover message as other expedition members prepared for the trip and said goodbye to their loved ones. These scenes were especially important; they showcased Sheppard's skepticism about joining the expedition and his self-doubt that he had anything of value to contribute. Additionally, not only did Elizabeth's voiceover provided necessary history about Atlantis and the Ancients for anyone new to the show, but that scene also exhibited a personal side to Elizabeth and showcased the large sacrifices that the expedition members were making, and Joel Goldstein's beautiful music had made this scene all the more poignant and touching. It is a shame that these scenes not included here, and I am sorely disappointed that these essential scenes have been cut out from the pilot episode here on Amazon.",1468886400,,1217,5.059701492537314

Whatever powers that be that decided to have episodes with scenes removed need to be removed themselves. Crucial scenes in the first episode, like O'Neill and Shepards flight from Antarctica and Shepard's first meeting with Col. Sumner. There were quite a few scenes over the course of the first episode that helped build the story that were blindly removed.

I do have the entire series on Blu-ray, so I can fix the problem for myself. First time viewers are going to be seriously left out.",1466208000,12,680,4.520325203252033

Just the greatest story line and the quality is as good and well put together as a great movie. If you listen to the producers talking (if you have the actual DVD's, they were so into the filming of it and every little detail. We got the complete 10 seasons of SG1, the original movie with Curt Russell, Continuum, The Arc of Truth and the 5 seasons of Atlantis. I liked the Universe series and they just left us all hanging. If they could finish that and continue with 5 more seasons of Atlantis, I could not be more happy. Whoever made the decision to kill Stargate made a bad mistake.",1463529600,,712,4.166666666666667

The Sheppard/McKay duo is one that was so perfect that it's hard to find the actors and writers who can create such awesome characters that work so perfectly together.,1461715200,,317,4.482758620689655

2271588,5,B000980GR0,"It is a very good spin off of the original Stargate series.  The main characters are all very likable and have good chemisty, even the Doctor who is a whiny is likeable.  The main story starts with the discovery of the ancient city of Atlantis in the Pegasus galaxy, and earth sending a  large military and research contingent there knowing that they will only be able to do this once and that for the most part they will be on their own, until another way is found to bring them back or send support to them.  Upon arriving there in the city find that the city is underwater and that the shield holding back the water is failing.  Unexpectedly the city raises to the surface.  They are only able to power some of the cities areas with the generators that they brought.  As they go out exploring they are met by a Wraith raiding party that takes some of the off world team.  In rescuing them back they inadvertently awaken the whole hive.  They find out that the Wraith are the ones that defeated the Ancients, and in a last ditch effort the Ancients had submerged the city and fled back to Earth, those that were left.  The teams as they go out exploring looking for allies and energy modules to power the city run into allies and foes alike.  The season ends with the Wraith coming to capture Atlantis in hopes of finding a way to Earth to open a new feeding ground for them.",1461715200,4,1377,4.33984375

For whatever reason they changed the format on the last season of this series and the writing suffered along with whoever made the decisions on where to focus the story and who they focused on. Too bad.",1460592000,,461,4.7625

Some of it is for syndication versions others I don't know why... Either way they need to offer the full episodes or watching this here is just FAR from the best option.  afik other streaming sites have the same issues... So you are stuck ordering dvds with a bad reputation for not working or having the wrong stuff on the discs... or you can pirate it.

I think this has it all. You quickly become attached to the characters and feel their experiences. Atlantis has a lot to be discovered and there are a lot of people who have wanted to find it. So, you have to become acquainted to your new home, protect your new home, try to make sure you follow the military guidelines, protect your people at home and when exploring ""off world"".....phew! I think you are getting my point.

There is a lot of action, funny interactions and every other emotion you can think of. You will be hooked. Sit back and enjoy the ride. Umm...I forgot to ask you...do you have the ancient gene? ",1455580800,,837,4.493421052631579

2271768,4,B000980GR0,"Admittedly I like anything to do with Stargate stories. The entire premise of ancient technology taps into so many of the mysteries that both scientist and archeologist are unable to explain. The SG series combined great story line with generally good acting, great music, and good cinematography. The characters in Stargate Atlantis are dreadfully human, often lovable and sometimes frustrating. SG-1 and Atlantis are grounded, for good or bad, in the hard to believe universe that amazingly speaks English, a necessary presupposition to enable a fluid and exciting story line. But tuck that aside and enjoy the shows. Atlantis replaces Colonel O'Neil with Major Sheppard, right down to the cowlick hairdo and rebellious leadership styles, so for the SG fanbase it was a nice transition. The Wraith are the clear replacement of the Goa'uld. They lack the complexity of character but they have the essential evil and fear factor.  As with any series, it's hard to compete with a movie production. To carry on the story requires great writing and production. And some patience on the part of viewers and fans like myself who would might not like every episode. But this is a great series. The characters remain true to their personalities and key characters show development over time. There is a main character for every taste from prophet to warrior, idealist to pragmatism.",1455580800,2,1375,5.111111111111111

I really like the plot. It keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat. You are always hoping for the best and watching them get themselves out of impossible situations. Its is sad that they only made 5 seasons. I would have liked to see this go on like the original stargatge.

I would suggest giving it a try if you are looking for a good sci-fi show.

Nevertheless, they develop their own distinctive personalities as the season progresses.  The season contains all the drama, humor, and action fans have come to expect from this long-running science fiction franchise.  Perhaps due to improvements in technology, this series is even able to top the original in terms of special effects.  Highly recommended for fans of the original series (but make sure you have watched seasons 1 to 8 of Stargate SG-1 before you start on Stargate Atlantis).",1454976000,,643,5.203883495145631

You will have to give the show 2 episodes to setup the plot for the series (this series has a weak start), but it does get much better.  Remember this is the pilot season for the show. You can tell that show is working on a limited budget for the first season.  The series give a nice nod to Stargate SG-1.  If you a deep Stargate fan watching all of the series, you will catch the nods to Stargate Universe.  In general, the show does nice work with make-up and special effects, but you will have to buy into humans living on different planets all knowing how to speak Engligh, there is no universal translator in this show.",1453680000,,690,4.196969696969697

Both the characters and the scripts lack depth.  Additionally, many of the scenarios are just not believable.  I know, I know.  There are certainly scenarios and characters in SG1 that are not believable, but at least in SG1, I wanted to believe.  In Atlantis, I could care less. At this point, I'll probably just move on to season 2 to see if the episodes improve.

Solid cast that build their characters through out the seasons.  Great villains, intelligent dialogue, plausible science (as it goes...), and, of course, the mystery and wonder of traveling to Atlantis.  The fact that Atlantis is in another galaxy is just the perfect bonus - what an adventure that would be.

The only thing I can really say against it is that they didn't really seem to know what to do with Rainbow Sun Franks's character in this first season. He just seemed like...a guy. I didn't dislike him at all, but they seemed to be trying too hard to make him the normal down to earth guy. The other characters are all solid and three-dimensional (It helps that some of them were already introduced in Stargate-SG-1). Definitely recommend this",1443657600,,532,4.494845360824742

2272136,5,B000980GR0,"Okay - I admit it.  I am a Stargate addict.  It's so great to be able to go through the entire series one season after the other.  Naturally, I highly recommend that you first watch several seasons of Stargate SG-1 to get the context if you're not familiar with the shows.  There is quite a bit of ""outer space"" violence, little sex and a small amount of language, so you might want to limit this to ages 14 and up.  Although, today's kids are so used to violence in video games and such, you might be able to get away with age 10 and up.  Parents discretion.  These are two long running series that just grab you.  It's also helpful to watch the movie ""Stargate"" before embarking on the TV series!",1442534400,,698,4.2748091603053435

2272237,3,B000980GR0,"Stargate atlantis is a pretty good series. BUT, the fact is for an expedition / endeavor that is to be the most important in human history, Dr.
Weir was absolutely the wrong choice for a mission leader. Think about this, just 6 months prior to Dr. Weir heading off to lead this expedition she was beginning her command of stargate command (Right after the 3 month ""review board"") So, she poorly runs the SGC for a grand total of 6 months, only to resign and then be selected to ""lead"" the atlantis expedition. Now having only known about the stargate / new reality for 9 or 10 months, your telling me the world leaders and international comity select a ""business broker"", to go find and retrieve atlantis? BS

At this point in the stargate series the ONLY clear choice would be SG1 and Hammond to lead this expidition. As oppsosed to Dr. Weir's supposed knowledge of ""ancient tech"" having only studied the antartic outpost for a month, wouldn't Dr. Daniel Jackson, having already studied ""ancient tech"" for 10 years have been a more reasonable choice. Wouldn't General Hammonds knowledge of having lead stargate command for 8 or 9 years have been a better mission commander? Also, as an alterative, retired general Jack Oneill would have filled the mission commander just fine as a civilian.

Lets face it, with an ego so large that he thinks he's gods gift to save the ""universe"", Rodney McCey is a jack ass who nobody even wants to watch his idiot personality. Furthermore in 80% of the situations he supposedly ""Saves the day"". He CAUSED them to begin with, by screwing with stuff way over his head. Samantha Charter had already proven herself from before the stargate was opened, maybe what? 15 years experience? Samantha Carter should have been the leader of the front line gate team at atlantis. Teal'c having no real interest in the pegasus galaxy would have probably stayed behind. No problem, the best member of the entire atlantis expedition was already there, ""Roanan"" . Isn't it interesting that the 2 most reasonable, and persistently have the moral high ground over all the others, and rightly so, is ""Roanan and kayla""  and they weren't even part of the atlantis expedition to begin with. But most of all Dr. Weir has no business running any expedition, much less one of this importance. Do i have a problem with female leaders? Nope, Samantha Carter is a far better leader. I say, if SG1 had been the ones selected to recover Atlantis, it would have been back to earth in under 6 months.

Here is just one instance of ludacris leadership by Dr. Weir. Season 2 episode ""Inferno"" introduces the atlantian warship renamed as the ""Orion"". Now, Orion having 1 or 2 ""ZPM's"". Is sitting there hidden and parked light years away and wraith ship is on long range scanners. The very next Episode ""Season 2 episode 'Allies'"", last episode of season 2, here comes the Wraith ship, hails them, say's they want to negotiate / blackmail them. So Dr. Weir is in the position that the single hive ship has blackmailed her that they will give away altantis' location if they do not comply. Well At her disposal is the 1 or 2 ZPM's in warship Orion, as well as the earth starship Daedalus is there. Wether its 1 or 2 ZPM's doesn't matter, the city can intersteller flight AND launch Drone weapons. So you take the ZPM from the hidden Orion ship. Use Atlantis and Daedalus to destroy the single wraith hive. Open hyperspace window to a new location with both Atlantis and Daedalus. Once Atlantis is relocated you take the ZPM onboard Daedalus and Hyperspace Daedalus back to the Orion. Then Hyperspace both back to orbit the new planet Atlantis is on. Problem solved, Atlantis hidden again with 2 warships in orbit as a protective cover.

So, instead how does Dr. Weir handle it? Dr. Weir trusts the enemy, ""Even though the whole conversation started with blackmail"", and ends up with a 1.5 years of dealing with ""Michael the half converted Wraith"" and in the end having to sacrifice Orion to protect Atlantis. (And having to relocate atlantis ANYWAY)

So after having stuck around so long that they awakened every enemy in the entire pegasus galaxy , ""Including a replicator home planet"" who does the earth international comity replace her with? Oprah listening homo Richard Woolsie. Who just happens to be the only person they could find who was WORSE than Dr. Weir. (Which is questionable because at least he got atlantis back to earth)

I gave it 3 star for creativity on episodes and seasons. But i find the whole character selection of a band of 3rd rate misfits as highly improbable, compared to who would actually be selected for such an important endevour",1440115200,,4660,4.724477244772448

Here on Amazon as well as elsewhere, SG-A rates as high as SG-1, which completed 10 seasons and had several follow-up movies. Just goes to show you that the ""Top Brass"" at most networks are out of touch with the viewing public, relying too heavily on external ratings outfits. In the US, Nielsen uses a technique called statistical sampling to rate shows; Nielsen creates a ""sample audience"" and then counts how many in that audience view each program, then extrapolates from the sample and estimates the number of viewers in the entire population watching the show. This process can potentially be precise, but it can also be wildly inaccurate. It sure was here!

2272341,4,B000980GR0,"Pretty decent sci-fi show. Slightly campy at times and the production values aren't always great, but the characters are interesting and the plots are usually better than they sound. The first season has a nice tension between the civilians of Atlantis, who are there to explore the alien worlds and learn the science, led by Elizabeth Weir, a very smart, competent leader who emphasizes diplomatic resolution and long-term peace, and the Marines, led by John Sheppard, also smart and competent, but more willing to use violence and brute strength. The mission is under civilian jurisdiction, so technically Elizabeth is in charge except during security threats, and she and John balance each other really well, actually, when they aren't arguing about what constitutes a security threat, and John bothers to actually follow orders. The show does a really good job with the alien bad guys, the Wraith, who are genuinely creepy and have enough presence to create a sense of mild dread even when they aren't in an episode, and the human bad guys end up being pretty worrisome themselves.

The humor is pretty good, especially when it's aimed at Rodney, head scientist and the self-proclaimed 'smartest man in the universe', who can be pompous and whiny; John spends a lot of time laughing at him behind his back (and sometimes to his face), but like all the characters on this show, Rodney's a balance of flaws and heroism. The cast has pretty good chemistry overall, and the balance of humor and tension is good. There are a few kind of slow episodes, but they build to a pretty satisfying cliffhanger by the end. If you're a sci-fi fan, you should give it a shot.",1438214400,,1663,4.855633802816901

Missing also is a video montage of key characters as they prepare to leave their lives on Earth and a video from Weir to her fiance.

This vital ingredient is totally non-existent in the episodes of Atlantis that I have watched.

There have been some character crossovers from SG-1 in the pilot episode, and I understand that later in the series Amanda Tappiing returns as Col. Samantha Carter (not sure of her rank in Stargate Atlantis...just calling on her final rank from SG-1).  I didn't want to just start with her episodes without knowing what led to her character's entrance into Stargate Atlantis, so I will at least watch it through those episodes.

2272527,4,B000980GR0,"Stays well within the canon of the Stargate franchise, provides a new set of personalities but the SGA Team 1 is almost a mirror copy of SG-1.  Would liked to have seen a bit more variance and creativity in that regard, and maybe a bit more creativity in the ""dooms day"" style. You could literally replace Wraith with Goa'uld and never know you were watching a different franchise other than set difference.  Maj. Sheppard is a very close resemblance of Col. O'Neil in regards to playing the funny, military leader smart, sometimes science dumb part that we saw Richard Anderson play in SG1 season 1.  But it works in the dynamics of the rest of the cast very well.
If you are a Stargate fan, then you will love this one seriously.  Wish it would have gone for 10 seasons.  Dang shame they ran out of creativity and ability to keep it on the air.",1432944000,,846,4.432258064516129

I realize they have to keep the story interesting but sometime the problems that happen just at the right (or wrong time) are a little too much to be coincidental.",1431043200,,430,4.417721518987341

2272639,5,B000980GR0,"The opening scene for Episode 1 hooked me within two seconds.  I had never seen any of the Stargate shows, not even the movie that started it all, before I saw Atlantis.  (I know, hard to believe but it is sad and true.)  I have since watched them all, and am now making my third lap through watching Atlantis, and I love it almost as much now as the first time!  The casting, directing, and acting are all top-shelf, and the sets and special effects are spectacular.  Atlantis is true escapist entertainment, as good IMO as anything else in that genre on the small screen.  I should warn you, Atlantis viewing can be habit forming!  And since no good thing can last forever, when you finish the last episode of the last season, you WILL have withdrawals!",1429401600,,755,4.467153284671533

All in all it's a great series with lot's of good entertainment value and I love the steampunk parts interjected into it.  I would have given it 5 stars except as much as I do like the actors I just haven't fallen in love with them like I have on other series's that I have watched.  Given their situation and the fact that they have just vaulted across the universe into a strange new world I felt the actor's should have been more in awe and their expressions should have been more in tune to their predicement and the fact that hey their not in Kansas anymore.  Everyone speaks english no matter where they go and no one is amazed or stunned by what new things they run across, but as I stated it's dated and it seems all of the older series had this same mo so to speak.",1428105600,,938,4.188888888888889

Don't get me wrong typical TV study but it was entertaining with uniqueness guy situation the characters had to keep from earth.  Definitely 1000 times better than Stargate universe that show was horrible. It was Days of our lives on Steroids.,1427500800,,351,4.85

I LOVE the show, but one thing I noticed about the Amazon digital version was that they split the premier episode (originally 2 hours long) into two separate episodes. Normally that would not have been a problem, but I noticed that whole scenes seemed to be completely missing from each episode, and some of them provided necessary information for the episode or the show as a whole.

The characters have a tendency to be their own worst enemy as well as hypocritical in how they carry out actions. So much potential in these characters and storylines just end up in missed opportunity that lacks edginess. There is some very funny dialogue at times and pop culture references though not as good as Farscape but maybe season 2 or 3 it'll hit it's stride.,1425686400,,514,4.5978260869565215

I was wrong. It is different from SG1, certainly. Thanks to Prime, my wife and I have watched Atlantis Season 1..and 2...and are now on 3. She doesn't even much like sci-fi--or didn't--and we are going through the whole thing.

The cast was not quite as strong as SG1. The original Dr. Weir, I thought, was a stronger character and Dr. McKay is about 10 times more annoying than I see any reason for him to be. Hewlett is a good actor, though. He plays a PITA well--why they wrote that character that was is a mystery to me. The cast evens out mostly and the stories are quite interesting. That is the strong point. You just never know if  you are going to get something cute or ominous or droll. We really are enjoying it.",1424736000,,885,4.384146341463414

2272822,5,B000980GR0,"I was a big fan of the series back when it was originally on air.  It was nice to go back and see that the show is still as enjoyable as it was during the original air dates!  If you enjoyed the original SG-1, I think you will find this to be an enjoyable viewing experience.  My only complaint is that the Stargate team lands in an amazing new ""home"" with technology so far beyond anything offered in SG-1 that I thought it would be great if the entire year was devoted to exploring, fighting, surviving and even adapting the amazing technology on this station.  Instead, they immediately start leaving the station and fighting Pegasus galazy bad guys. Why go off world until you have studied and adapted all the technologies offered on this amazing space station to give the team the best advantage possible?",1424390400,,810,4.56551724137931

To say that this episode is lame is to decry the who franchise. SG-1 was entertaining. This show is just stupid. I am sure the legions of morons will no doubt crucify me for making this post. Go ahead morons. This series sucks, just like every other scifi MGM has ever attempted. They don't get what makes quality SciFi. Because they too are idiots.",1424044800,,528,4.443298969072165

2272850,5,B000980GR0,"Probably the best Stargate series of all the Stargate programs. All 5 seasons are excellent and filled with a sense of realism that surpasses most of the Sy-Fi's created.  The cast is perfect and their episodial challenges flow from each episode to the next and season to season, as if, there was in fact a real Atlantis and these are re-enacted biographies that tells the complete story.  Watch all seasons as close together as possible to get the real story line and the introduction of the new characters that are added and some that disappear.",1421280000,,547,4.747368421052632

2272852,4,B000980GR0,"I just can't get over the fact that they sent 50ish people into a unknown situation with very-very limited supplies (Only see like 5 big boxes of supplies). It would be more believable if the original expedition had a size of 10 (1 SG team and 1 Military team).

SGU and SG1 had better starting episodes, besides that this series holds up to be one of the best science fiction series ever created.

Out of all the Star Gate franchise, I find Atlantis to be the least re-watchable.",1420848000,,480,4.443181818181818

2273022,3,B000980GR0,"It wasn't bad, but it's just not as good as SG1.  I'm seriously trying to give it an honest chance.  I've put aside my love for SG1 and have given SGA a clean slate, but it's just not doing it for me. I think my problem is that I fell in love with O'Niell and the rest of the characters almost instantly.  Sheppard and McKay just...to me they aren't as likeable and the Wraith aren't as interesting as the Gaould and the Ori.  I plan to finish the season and move on to season two with the hope that it gets better for me.

This isn't a bad show, so I don't want to turn people away, but if you are as strongly invested in the SG1 team as I was, this may not be as enjoyable for you.  I didn't even care for the last seasons of SG1, but I digress.  The show is pretty good with better effects than earlier seasons of SG1.  The new planets they visit are interesting, but only about half the time.  Basically it's just 'ok'.",1415577600,,923,4.027472527472527

2273024,4,B000980GR0,"As a huge fan of science fiction shows who has grown tired of waiting for a new sci-fi or space opera series, I decided to check out some of the classic shows I missed during their original runs, including Stargate Atlantis (SGA).

My first introduction to Stargate was actually Stargate Universe (SGU).  While I didn't hate it, I also was coming off of the amazing BSG, and SGU was somewhat of a let-down, being too dark and not having enough serialization. Several years later, and still no BSG-quality science fiction series has come out, so I have decided to start fresh with SGA.

First off, SGA looks stunning. From the sets, special effects, and costumes to the production quality itself, SGA is beautiful.

Then, there's the main character: John Sheppard, played by handsome, likable, and funny actor Joe Flanigan. John is what I think of as the typical American hero: he's got strong sense of what's right, he doesn't play by the rules, and he's always willing to put himself in danger for his team.  There's something very appealing about an unapologetic hero.  John is supported by a team of characters that includes doctors, researchers, military personnel, and alien natives.  While not all of them won me over (I know he's a fan favorite, but I strongly disliked the arrogant genius, Dr. McKay, for a long time and after 1 season I still find Dr. Weir to be a complete bore), several stand out including the wise, strong, and courageous Teyla, the reliable, humorous Dr. Beckett, and innocent, young soldier, Ford.

The villains, The Wraiths, look pretty terrifying and make a good enemy for our heroes.  As the season progresses, we get some good conflicts with them and exciting action sequences.

Atlantis itself is exciting to behold, as well as the various worlds the team finds themselves exploring, defending, and being trapped on. There is a rich mythology that is fun to discover throughout the season.

One complaint I have is there are a lot of filler, stand-alone episodes.  I tend to prefer serialized stories, but thankfully most of the individual stories provide good character moments that pay off later.

I look forward to continuing on with season 2, and then at some point giving SG-1 a go and SGU another chance.

Other science fiction I enjoy: Syfy's Battlestar Galactica, Lost, Fringe, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Farscape",1415404800,,2371,4.924623115577889

It feels a LOT like SG1 as far as the type of action, how fast the plot moves, etc. Some might find this disappointing, but being such a big fan of SG1, I liked that element. I just purchased Season 2 and am looking forward to watching it as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because SG1 remains my favorite. But Atlantis is growing on me. If you haven't seen SG1, references to types of aliens and/or technology might make it a bit hard to follow in places, but after a few episodes it would start to make more sense.",1414713600,,673,4.106060606060606

I highly recommend this one if you are a person in need of 'closure' for the show, I wouldn't give spoilers (I don't like when people do that) but they explore new places meet new people, imaginative writers take you to a new experience.

It's just not on par with the rest of this Epic, including Stargate Universe, which I've also watched. Atlantis has its moments, don't get me wrong, and I think it's necessary for the whole story, but it's just not a good fit. I had to force myself to watch some of it because it doesn't hold you the way the other two do. It's just a good story and a little too much action.

I like the original Stargate movie, and pretty much hate the first series spun off from it -- hate the characters, hate the cast, hate the cheesy writing. Even though it's a spinoff of a spinoff, I think Atlantis is a step up. Better cast, better sets and graphics, more interesting storyline and somewhat less insultingly dumbbell writing. Sure, I was hoping well before the end of season 1 that the Rodney character would get eaten by a Wraith (he doesn't, and continues through the entire series to be just as aggravating and one-note) and that the Shepard dude would find a comb somewhere in the city (he doesn't, but at least other characters sometimes make fun of his hair). And by the last season it loses its way and muddles around terribly, the way a lot of long-lived tv shows do. I mean I still would rather watch something from the Star Trek franchise, but for tv sci-fi this isn't bad.",1410480000,,980,4.51123595505618

They do an excellent job of explaining what happened to Jack O'Neill and the others in the premiere episode, then the many members of the new team volunteer for a mission from which they know they may never return.

It is an interesting take on man's search for his origins as are all three of the Stargate series.  I particularly like the obnoxious but brilliant Rodney McKay with his constant whining he still manages to be likeable in his own way.

2273237,4,B000980GR0,"It is very difficult for a movie that has been successful to continue on with and not become dreadfully boring after awhile. Often the follow ons attempt to use whatever had been successful in the preceding movie. However, the first with its novelty will have an interest solely because it is the first. With Stargate the follow ons were formed into multiple shorter episodes that allowed the constructive individuals to use the movie solely as the first address on the Gate with an unlimited number of new destinations as well as new story lines.
The jump to a completely new portion of the universe allowed the writers to introduce new species that were very different from those that populated the initial Galaxy, both in appearance, but to a greater extent, their unique abilities. To make this possible required the human like and a very advanced species to have fought these ""unstoppable"" beings only to be exterminated or were they?

In the Milky Way they were always searching for them now they have the city and it just stops except for when it is necessary for to defeat the Wraith at times. Where are all the other marvels that would enable a race to to make star gates and ships that travel hyper space like the Asgard and their old enemies had. They found these knowledge depositories in the milky way that were older yet here nothing I guess that was biggest the disappointment with the series for me.

2273287,5,B000980GR0,Thoroughly enjoyed the story and acting,1404086400,,39,5.666666666666667
2273288,4,B000980GR0,This show really tried to explore the mechanics of an SG-1 Team but in an all new galaxy. I would recommend it.,1404000000,,111,4.090909090909091
2273289,5,B000980GR0,"So far, in the first 20 minutes, I've found 2 missing scenes - (I noticed because in the past, I've watched this series so many times). One is in the helicopter when the General is trying to talk John into joining the expedition- it is totally missing!  and the second is when John is standing at the event horizon with the soldier, the scene where John asks him something about what it feels like going through the wormhole, the soldier says something like, ""It hurts like hell"", then he laughs and falls into it - they only have the part where he falls into it and laughs. This makes me wonder how many other scenes are cut from this episode!",1403913600,,644,4.366666666666666
2273290,5,B000980GR0,This is a take off from SG 1 series and I would like to say that they have done themselves an excellent job. This series has none of the other bad guys from SG 1 but all new characters named the Wraith. I would recommend this series as the next step up from SG 1.,1403913600,,263,3.8
2273291,5,B000980GR0,"I never got to watch the first years of Stargate Atlantis, and I am so happy I can go back and watch it now, thanks Amazon Prime !",1403827200,,130,3.6785714285714284

2273302,4,B000980GR0,"The series has excellent writing, acting, and production.  The story lines remain pertinent.  Some are a little dark, but worth the watching.  I would not recommend it for the under 13 group, it's a little violent and the themes too sophisticated for them.",1403222400,,256,4.906976744186046

2273304,1,B000980GR0,Uneventful and slow moving with less than average acting. Story line needs development. I didn't make it through the first episode.,1403136000,,131,5.285714285714286
2273305,4,B000980GR0,Though I don't like the heavy child focus nor the fact that all the smart humans were white and all the slaves were dark skinned all in all it is one of my favorite sci-fi shows.  There are a few things i would change but most i would keep the same. I liked how they covered every sci-fi theory as well as historical mythology. It was a great series.,1403049600,,350,4.072463768115942
2273306,5,B000980GR0,This builds off previous series and movies but does not really include previous characters.  It is fun and creative like the previous shows.  There is a new antagonist evil culture and a host of new worlds to explore.,1402876800,,217,4.684210526315789

2273313,4,B000980GR0,"I great spin-off. Almost as good as the original. Anyone that liked SG-1, will also like Atlantis. I can only hope that someday, there will be a continuation to the Stargate saga.",1402444800,,179,4.625
2273314,5,B000980GR0,This is an exciting adventure to a place that ancient scholars have written of.  My wish is that mankind will one day step onto Atlantis.,1402358400,,137,4.48

2273316,4,B000980GR0,"Still wish it hadn't been canceled. Have the complete series on DVD, but now that it's on prime I can enjoy it on my roku without even getting up out of my chair. If you liked SG1 Atlantis is a pretty good continuation. Not as dark as SG Universe and the characters are more likable for my tastes in television.",1402185600,,311,4.2
2273317,4,B000980GR0,SGA was a great continuation to the StarGate universe. I enjoyed this series the first time around and am glad I came back to revisit Atlantis.,1402185600,,143,4.538461538461538

2273320,5,B000980GR0,"great cast.
they have interesting episodes, descent plot though the whole show.
lots of excitement and cliff hanging episodes. they even make a ""main"" character go crazy.",1401840000,,170,5.333333333333333
2273321,5,B000980GR0,"I absolutely love this show. The script and plots aren't the most original...and the acting isn't the greatest. Having said that, I love this show with all my heart and soul. I've been marathoning it for the past week!

Each episode is highly entertaining. The show doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a huge relief. And although the characters are not overly complex, I, for one, am SO VERY glad that they are not overly complex, tortured beings who over-contemplate humanity and their influences on other worlds, blah blah blah. The show touches upon the influence of humanity, human compassion, etc., but also delves satisfyingly into just plain, good ol' fashioned conflict-resolution action. This allows me hours of mind-numbing, stress-free television fun.

I also love the all-for-one-and-one-for-all attitude of the group and in-your-face archetypes: the capable (but sometimes conflicted) leader, the charming rogue, the compassionate foreigner, the arrogant scientist, and the mysterious fighter.

Also, Jason Momoa. <3 That is all.",1401753600,,1050,5.509316770186335

2273325,5,B000980GR0,"This was one of televisions best science fiction series. The main characters were easy to get into, and the special effects were very well done. This is one of those series where you'll want to own every season (I know I do).",1401321600,,225,4.380952380952381
2273326,3,B000980GR0,"This show is fantastic, I have it on DVD, and decided to watch it on Amazon Instant when I didn't have DVDs with me. The pilot episode has had several scenes either cut out or sections of scenes cut out. This didn't change the overall story, but it did change the nuances, and some of the scenes just seemed weird. If you watch this and somethign seems off, it's probably because there is something missing. I would buy the DVD's instead.",1401321600,3,438,4.419753086419753

2273329,4,B000980GR0,"I would say that this is a logical extension of the old TV seris, however Doctor McKay character gets to be very annoying and iritating.  We will see how the show develops in the later seasons.",1401235200,,193,4.361111111111111

2273331,1,B000980GR0,Would not play. Stayed in buffer mode then went to  error message. This seems to happen every time I try to watch something.

2273332,5,B000980GR0,Solid show I hope they create another sg team.  With the technology available I can imagine something really exciting.  Rumor is they are doing a sequel to the first movie which works for me.,1400889600,,191,4.588235294117647

2273335,5,B000980GR0,I am a huge fan a sci-fi and I really enjoy the story line that is the Stargate series.  Sure there are some episodes that don't fit but they still are good episodes.

2273350,4,B000980GR0,As spin off shows go this one doesn't disappoint. The continuity from SG1 to Atlantis is maintained with better sets and improved storyline. I wish it had run longer than it did. The show that followed (Stargate Universe) was so terrible it seems to have killed the entire franchise.,1399420800,,283,4.795918367346939

I like how this show was introduced and how it interacts with the whole gang on SG-1. It has the same quality and satisfaction, too! You will like how this show developed as time and the Seasons moved on. It chronicles the adventures of a group of scientists and soldiers sent to explore the lost city of Atlantis, henceforth, the name ""STARGATE  ATLANTIS.

In fact I never saw any of the Stargate series and now I am watching all of them. I love them. I especially love John Sheppard and Jack O'Neill.  Stargate Atlantis was full of  wonderfully  exciting adventurous stories. Sadly I will never get to see another.  The characters are so different, exciting, humorous but still capable of being serious. I just love them all",1398643200,,528,4.505263157894737

2273362,5,B000980GR0,"Stargate Atlantis is one of my favorite shows if all time.  While I love SG-1 when U went back and watched the first three seasons there was a lot of cheese puff episodes.  Atlantis started more ""grown up"" because of their experience having already written many seasons of SG-1.",1398211200,,278,4.653061224489796

2273366,5,B000980GR0,"I loved the original Stargate series and thought the idea of spinning off the whole Atlantis discovery from the original show was both good writing as going to an entire new Galaxy to explore certainly has enough storyline to support its own show plus as much as I love the original show it had a long good run, but the timing was great to bring closure to the original an this was a natural branching point.  Some of us may have liked to see the transition of some of the characters from the original show, but they did a good job of integrating the plots and use Atlantis to pump new life into the franchise.  The quality of the show stands on the success of the original series by leveraging many of the big discoveries from the original show allowing the off world base that can't easily stargate back and forth to earth make for great starting point to a show that stood on it's own.  Yes, no doubt that Sheppard has many of the personality traits as our original hero, but why kill a good thing?  Being off in another Galaxy somewhat isolated allows for the use and introduction of more of the ancients technology letting teh story grow in a way that the writers don't have to worry about reconciling with modern day earth.  Instead we have a new set of bad guys even nastier than the original, some fresh faces in familiar roles based on the whole stargate structure giving it a powerful launching point from the original show which I think they did an excellent job of building on allowing SG-1 continue on and fade away while Atlantis could grow it's own with new adventures and story lines that leave us able to have technology advances along the way allow for less isolation as the show progresses and their defensive capabilities and understanding of the Wraith continue to increase.  Being a spinoff of a successful show extending the show to a franchise of shows can produce other good shows as we saw with the second generation of Star Trek spinoff's.  Some better than others, but none the less still enough good to be an overall success.  I didn't have time to watch either of these shows when they were on TV so being able to watch them by streaming them allows me to fit them into my time line and watch all the shows, not just the ones I could fit in to my schedule.  So having seen many episodes in the original run I already knew I liked the show, but being able to watch them all allows me to move it a level higher and thoroughly enjoy the show and some of the interesting moral challenges it introduces along with the continual build up of allies, foes, and technology.  Just as in the original series the writing relies on a basic formula for many episodes but they still do a good job of having the show story tie into the overall story and events and choices made earlier.  Having the show start by the team accidentally awakening the Wraith allowed for a super nasty enemy to be found in this new galaxy while introducing secondary effects of it being early that buys time for the team to evolve and not walk into a universe fully infected with Wraith that they would simply be wiped out in (wouldn't have made for much of a show).  The need to protect the location of earth being one of those byproducts introduces the raising of the stakes and the excitement as protecting the outpost suddenly becomes an important underlying need as it protects earth from the under-fed Wraith.  Definitely raising the level of bad guys from other shows as the thought of being harvested and fed on by one of them is truly creepy.  Overall I think the first season did a great job of establishing Stargate Atlantis as its own show that could support itself without a long transition from the original and quickly build an independent story line that could have had a longer run, but still was in my opinion a successful one in terms of science fiction shows go.  It didn't have as long a run as the original, but as far as I've seen so far (and I still have 3 seasons to watch) they did a great job and I can only hope that they are able to end the show without corrupting the franchise legacy (I still have never seen the final episodes).  So for the first season given the perspective of being just over half way through the second I think it is great and the transition handled well.  I'm excited to have 3 more seasons to watch and can only hope the quality remains high and they can write a successful ending in terms of the franchise storyline.  I can only hope that SG Universe is not an indication of where this goes as I thought that show was a significant letdown from the first two as I never became vested in the characters like I did in the original or Atlantis.",1397952000,,4690,4.414831981460023

So many different rooms and gadgets that had not even been fully explored. Although on for five seasons, there was so much more to be said.

I've never seen acting this cheesy before. Where do they find these guys. The plot and setting is fascinating but the acting is as good as that you see in a cheap porn movie.

It's a nice series and it provides some great entertainment between the two SCIFI series with both providing a series length enjoyment.  This one captures the spirit of mankind in its quest for adventure and exploration.  We may not be around when mankind leaves for the stars and other planets, but some of the series in their own quest for adventure from the perspective of entertaining the audience will have already identified some of the challenges that may face mankind in its own quests.",1395964800,,727,4.991735537190083

Wanting more, we tried SG Atlantis.  We struggled through 5-6 episodes before giving up.
For us, the characters weren't appealing, the story line was not interesting, and the shows just were not fun.  A new really weird set of bad guys appear, and were just too creepy/horror story for us.  SG1 mixed charming episodes with scientific facts, pulling real history into the stories, with a new twist.  SG1 was engaging...as much as I enjoyed Thor's Hammer, I enjoyed the crazy space race episode with silly commercials.  There was a light feeling to the show, and I did not find that same humor and grace in the Atlantis series.",1395705600,,700,4.658536585365853

The story lines are decent, the acting is first rate, and the characters are developed well.  Throughout the show's run, characters from SG1 make guest appearances.
If you enjoyed SG1, I think you will like this series as well.",1395446400,,457,4.617283950617284

2273405,4,B000980GR0,"Spinoffs can sometimes be cause for concern. Especially when you are talking about such a beloved series like SG-1. But I began watching Stargate Atlantis with an open mind and I'm enjoying it immensely. This show had a lot to live up to and I feel that they pulled it off. The writing is still creative, imaginative and engaging. It hosts a wonderful sense of adventure. I also feel like they did a great job jumpstarting the new show and introducing the cast. You'll see what I mean.
Sure, these guys will never be SG-1. We all know this. But, I've come to like these characters nonetheless. The acting is still very good and I feel each of these people played their parts quite well. Especially Dr. McKay.
It's a nice fresh take on the whole Stargate concept. Yes, there were a few uninteresting filler episodes every once in a while, but SG-1 has a few of those too. You just bear with them.
So a heads up to everyone out there; I decided to start watching Atlantis after the first episode of season 8 on SG-1. This was around the time THIS show originally aired. You basically flip back and forth a little bit I've been following a few episode guides online to assist with continuity. However, I know plenty of people that finished SG-1 entirely and then began Atlantis from the beginning. I'm sure that will be just fine too.

If you like SG-1. You'll love this. Its honestly that simple. If you're sad that you have/almost finished SG-1, well good news; you still have five more seasons of top-notch sci/fi action adventure.",1395014400,,1531,4.567272727272727

2273440,5,B000980GR0,The series is fast moving and full of action. Would highly recommend watching this Sci-FI. Once you start watching you will be hooked. but you need to start in Season 1 to understand as characters grow as series progresses,1392681600,,222,4.717948717948718
2273441,5,B000980GR0,Love this show and its characters. Too bad it ended so soon because it was the best of all the SG series.,1392681600,,105,3.8181818181818183
2273442,5,B000980GR0,"One of the best scfi tv shows produced in the last 20 years, wish it were still on. Great stories with excellent action sences and effects and a fantantic cast if you like scfi you will love this show.",1392595200,,201,4.17948717948718
2273443,5,B000980GR0,You couldn't ask for a better spin off to the original stargate storyline. An original new twist on SG exploration that delivers for 5 great seasons. A must see.,1392595200,,161,4.586206896551724
2273444,5,B000980GR0,"Great story.  Hard to beat the SG-1 run but off to good start.

Decent acting and special effects over all.",1392595200,,107,4.3
2273445,5,B000980GR0,At first when it first premiered on TV I didn't watch it because I was a loyal SG1 fan. But in season two I got hooked on the show. It was good watching Stargte Atlantis again from the start.,1392508800,,191,3.923076923076923
2273446,5,B000980GR0,"My husband and I really enjoy this show and my older (20 yr) daughter enjoys watching the ""hot guys"". Seriously though, it's a fairly intelligent series with thought involved - it isn't mindless, it's entertaining, with characters that grow and are easy to care about. Best of all I have something that my kids, hubby and I all agree on to watch.",1392422400,,346,4.596774193548387
2273447,5,B000980GR0,"Atlantis truly builds upon the framework set by SG-1, but I find it more intriguing than the SG-1 seasons out at the same time. A new, truly terrifying enemy makes it that much better, and the cast has such a great chemistry. The writing is more unique and reminiscent of early SG-1 seasons.",1392422400,,291,4.509433962264151
2273448,5,B000980GR0,"I loved the first Stargate series, and this one is just as good..... I like how they occasionally bring back the old actors from the first series.",1392336000,,146,4.444444444444445
2273449,4,B000980GR0,"This was my 1st time ever seeing the series.  Obviously, it being Stargate I love it.  It is true that I love anything Stargate related.
The only thing I didn't love about the season was Mckay ... He takes a lot of getting used to.  Definitely by seasons end I had had enough of him.  I'm livetweeting as I'm watching and I had mentioned this and one of my friends pointed out that he's not stupid, he's arrogant and sometimes lacks common sense.  That helped me appreciate him a little more.  The last 3 episodes were fantastic and pulled into the next season!

2273453,5,B000980GR0,Great show. I am so sad they cancelled it at season 5. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a little adventure.,1392163200,,116,4.086956521739131

2273457,5,B000980GR0,"I held off watching this for many years, mainly watching and re-watching SG-1 thinking it was far superior. But I was limiting myself. Atlantis is far superior and should have gone on long after just 5 seasons. So much more story building, and more interesting than SG-1. I hope they decide soon to at least start releasing movies for Atlantis.",1391990400,,344,4.75
2273458,4,B000980GR0,Wonderful cast and storyline. Keeps the Mythology of Stargate Command alive and well. If you are a fan of SG 1 you will love these guys.,1391990400,,136,4.269230769230769
2273459,5,B000980GR0,It was devastating to me when MGM did not followup on this amazing scifi story of space travel.  I own all season 1-5 and enjoyed watching them .. would recommed them to anyone who has an imagination of what is out there in space.,1391990400,,230,4.2272727272727275

2273461,4,B000980GR0,I came to this show after watching the first two episodes of Stargate SG-1.  The two things that I appreciated most about this show were the dry humor and the matter of fact nature of the emotional scenes.  So often in adventure shows the emotional scenes are overplayed or forced but that did not seem to be the case here.  Occasionally the show moves slowly but overall it keeps a steady pace successfully avoiding committing the sin of being an emotional roller coaster.,1391817600,,473,4.674698795180723
2273462,5,B000980GR0,This show has been a favorite of mine for some time. One of the main reasons I have a Amazon Prime account.,1391731200,,107,3.909090909090909

2273465,5,B000980GR0,This was a wonderfully creative series when it first aired and still is.  Thanks Amazon for having all of the seasons.,1391558400,,118,4.619047619047619

2273472,5,B000980GR0,"True to the over all feel of Stargate. Very fun and great cast of characters to love. If you are a science fiction fan, you have no choice but to watch this.",1391126400,,157,3.9375
2273473,5,B000980GR0,"Big Stargate Fan!!
Seeing this again is, for me, like seeing it for the first time. Would have loved another season!",1391040000,,116,4.571428571428571
2273474,5,B000980GR0,Love the science drama and action. The aliens creep me out at times. But the story is consistent and entertaining,1390867200,,113,4.7
2273475,5,B000980GR0,"Yeah Amazon keeps asking how I rate this series one season at a time. I'll just cut to the chase. I'll critique the whole series. After several viewings, I find the episodes that did not include wars with the wraith and repilcators to be, how shall I say, MEH.  Oh the virus is going to get us episodes were ok. So was the whalething episode. I realize they can't be fighting all the time but all those medieval villages with the same background music got to be annoying, so either cultures flew around in space ships or dug in the dirt with sticks. Love the characters (they make the show) and the all the star Wars and Star Trek references, Sheppard- ""He's on my ship!"" McCay -""What are you, Captain Kirk?"" and McCay's use of Kirk's name as a verb, ""Don't Kirk my sister"" Series could have used better episode writers but the characters are great, Joe Flannigan's endless mugging and Momoa's Chewbaca like persona. All in all the whole series has it's good points and bad. I've found coutless editing errors, Carson in 2 places at once and see through lighting rod couplings. The network where this series originally ran made a grave mistake cancelling this show, and I wish it would get revived again like Star Trek did. This show had a longer run than Star Trek and I know lots of people who love this show still. Let's face it, lots of us are 12 yrs old inside and that will not change no matter how old we get. I know a few who like me, suffer from voracious repeatisitis. Rock on
Shout out to Rainbow Sun Franks, they got rid of you too soon buddy, I think there was room for you and Jason Momoa",1390867200,,1602,4.357859531772576
2273476,4,B000980GR0,Great!  I watch them when they were originally were on TV - Still worth watching again and again. Great to watch on my IPad!,1390867200,,124,4.166666666666667

2273478,4,B000980GR0,"I have very fond memories of this series, so I'm pleased to find it available on Amazon Prime.  The perfect blend of humor and scifi ... recalling the good old days of the SciFi channel and the best in first run cable television programming.  If you've never seen the series, I recommend you do.  If you're not an Amazon Prime subscriber, why the hell not?  Good cast, good stories, decent effects ... can't lose.  Check out more reviews at bit.ly/tvfhell",1390694400,,455,4.6375

2273482,5,B000980GR0,"I love this show. It is funny at times and serious as well. Great blend of both. Scifi lovers show because mostly everything has that ""other world"" feeling. Effects are great too.",1390262400,,179,4.625

I fail to see why Amazon would have to offer only part of the pilot episode, considering that it had to fit into a network time frame when it aired on tv

So, the show itself gets 5 stars from me because I am and always will be a fan of Stargate Atlantis.
However, Amazon only gets 3 stars because of the scene-cutting.",1390176000,,507,4.195876288659794
2273485,5,B000980GR0,Its is an awesome show wish it was still going my favourite stargate show. Cast and the stories are great.,1390089600,,106,4.35
2273486,5,B000980GR0,"As a spin-off of SG-1 it has its own dramatic platform with well developed characters with strong personalities.  The narrative's continuity of blending our culture's futuristic ultra-high tech vision with other civilizations, like the Athosians led by Teyla, whom rely more on personal inner strengths and wisdom gives it balance.  The portrayal of Elizabeth Weir as a leader highlights the challenges that woman have in filling that role.  Torri Higginson does a solid commendable job in portraying an astute low-techie human leader in contrast to the dazzling super-tech skills of Sam Carter.  Of course Carter is a continuation of her character from SG-1 with her strong, dynamic intellectual persona.
  Unlike the personable character of Daniel in SG-1, the extremely egotistical Rodney McKay is a much harder performance to pull off continually.  However, David Hewlett does a great job showing the various sides of Rodney's frailties.  My only criticism of his performance is that he talks too fast like he's cranked on speed.  Likewise, the Scottish character Beckett has such a thick accent that he's sometimes hard to follow.  Although a lot of their jargon is sci-fi techie-speak that doesn't have any basis in reality, often important story line logic gets lost in their verbal shuffle.  You sometimes have to diagram their sentences to figure out what they're meaning to say.
  Many characters reccur intermittently from SG-1, making it difficult for writers to maintain Atlantis' own identity and integrity.  The only two characters that Atlantis writers failed to make a strong enough distinction between the two drama series are Atlantis's Col. John Sheppard and Col. Cam Mitchell from SG-1.  Or is it the other way around?  The two could be interchangeable between any of the story-line narratives on either series and you wouldn't notice the difference.
  While solid acting behind strong well written characters is Atlantis's strength, its' one fundamental weakness is a story line that is hyper-focused on the Wraith who hunt for ""feeding grounds"" of humans to eat.  By comparison the SG-1 had at least three major foes, the Goa'uld, the Replicators and the Ori to spread out their story lines.  That's probably why SG-1 lasted longer.  Regardless, Stargate Atlantis is very entertaining and always worth the watch.",1390089600,,2335,5.273712737127371
2273487,5,B000980GR0,It is a futuristic overview of the myth of the lost city Atlantis. I certainly recommend this show to everyone.,1389830400,,111,4.6

The actors are interesting, the story line seems fresh
and there is some good alien splatter.

2273497,4,B000980GR0,"Same basic idea as SGU (which I watched first somehow): the team gates into an environment filled with wonder and uses it as their home base while they:

a) explore it and find amazing new things there
b) explore other worlds via Stargate
c) have um, interesting encounters with other lifeforms, some of which are pleasant, but most of which are not
d) battle evil aliens intent on eating them
e) learn to get along as a mix of military and civilians

This last point is a large component of the plot of a lot of space opera/sci-fi series: All the Stargates, BSG, etc. It makes for lots of interesting drama and power struggles. This is a great series with solid writing, mostly good acting, and a semi-episodical format, much like the two mentioned above, and many, many other series' that detail the ongoing saga of a group of explorers. In some cases the explorers are simply exploring the boundaries of science (X-files, Fringe), and in others, such as this, they are exploring unknown frontiers (Star Trek, etc.). This is a MUST-see for the sci-fi series fan (eg. me). Good TV.  And bonus: free with Prime. Love it.",1389484800,,1120,4.646464646464646

The cast is uniformly great, but more than that they have a real chemistry. The setting for the show, discovering an abandoned Atlantis in another galaxy, is a wonderful platform to write SyFy. Add to that a new evil as terrifying as the Borg of Star Trek, the Wraith, and the best dialog every written for a science fiction show. AS a matter of fact it's so snappy and funny it could stand up against any show",1388361600,,531,4.267326732673268

2273533,5,B000980GR0,"I actually started my Stargate experience by watching Stargate Atlantis before I watched all 10 seasons of SG-1. Atlantis is a very, very worth successor to SG-1 (they actually ran concurrently for part of Atlantis' run).  I am now re-watching Atlantis because all the special appearances and references to SG-1 are much more meaningful now that I've watched SG-1.  I don't know why I wasn't watching this show while it was on TV, other than the fact that at the time I was (and still am) a huge Star Trek fan and treated all other SciFi as unworthy.  But watching Stargate (I watched all 10 seasons of SG-1 over the past 12 months after watching Atlantis first), I have to say this is an excellent series and I am very, very sorry I wasn't watching this when it was on TV.  I feel the same way about Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis as I do about Firefly...damn, I wish I was watching this when it was on rather than catching up years later on Amazon Prime.

I use to teach Filipino stick fighting so I know that there was an excellent trainer in the background.

Many years before on standard TV I watched one segment of this series caught in the then 'RUSH' of my life. However this year (2013) I collected all 5 Seasons to add to my SG-1 Series. I have found that this Series 'grows' on you the more you watch it, and it's certainly well done too as the previous 10 seasons of SG-1 are.

Just take a look at Stargate Universe if you think they can't blow it with the brilliance of the Stargate series. Stargate Atlantis actually improved on the basics that were built in Stargate SG-1. I mean, IMHO, the writers took Stargate SG-1 and molded it into something even greater with their casting and their concepts - the villians, the heroes, the mythos .... This was a brilliant show! If you haven't seen it - you're so lucky to get to see it for the first time! I'd probably suggest you watch Stargate SG-1 first - or at least a few seasons of that show before watching Stargate Atlantis/ BUT the cool thing is, you don't actually have to do so.

Not too often do they introduce a theory or idea that doesn't make some sense. You won't feel stupid watching the show. The various premises for the show are intelligently presented. Nothing worse than the dialogue, plot points, and ideas that make no sense whatsoever.

It does help to have some Stargate SG-1 knowledge under your belt to get you up to speed on the Wraith-filled stories.  Give it a try.",1380499200,,580,4.732673267326732

Colonel Shephard), Tayla, Ronan and the always funny Dr. McKay played by David Hewlet, his best performance ever I think, was as this character. This is probably rated as sci fi but has to be scifi-fantasy. Yes, they travel through a Stargate to other worlds and meet other people, which may be hopefully sci fi (wouldn't you love to be able to do that? I would) but those people speaking English is probably all fantasy. The villains, the Wraith, are wonderful fantasy too, or nightmare horror. So now we are talking scifi-fantasy-horror genre.

Season 1 obviously sets up story lines for future episodes and seasons, and there's a lot of good stuff down the line.  You'll see a few crossover episodes as well as character crossovers.

Most of the characters are good and there are some interesting plot twists, also, of a Sci Fi sort -- and I'm a Science Fiction fan.  The ""Wraith"" as an arch enemy are getting a little tiresome.  As when I was watching the Stargate series, while highly entertained, I sometimes wished for a plot that did not include a life or death situation and multiple fire fights.

Like several shows I've tried to watch streaming on Amazon prime, the closed caption subtitles are sometimes (recently on episode 7) off. I don't mean they are out of sync but that they apparently belong to a completely separate show.

Right from the beginning I felt the familiarity and the newness that the show tried to express, it took the classic blunders that led to Earth's war with the G'hould and ramped it up x10 against the Wraith.

The characters were endearing and really became a cohesive cast through the first season and into later ones. All in all, this show deserves a watch if you're a sci-fi fan, and especially if you're a fan of the Stargate universe.",1377216000,,604,4.583333333333333

The ongoing war between the Atlantis Team and the Wraith makes for good adventure, then mix in the struggles with the back-stabbing Genii and the shape-shifting nanite Replicators and you make it even better. The only problem I have with this series is that they ended it too soon, five seasons was not enough. They should bring back Atlantis for at least another season or two, a full length movie would be fine too, because there are many more stories to be told here, especially since the city of Atlantis doesn't belong where it finally ended up.",1375660800,,726,4.592307692307692

2273671,5,B000980GR0,"From the moment the city of Atlantis rises from the ocean like a Phoenix, I was hooked. What an incredible concept even though the series is a spinoff from SG1, in so many ways it's even better. In a different galaxy, facing the prospect they may never be able to return home...it takes incredible people to volunteer for something like that. The acting is phenomenal, in my opinion. Joe Flanigan as Major John Sheppard starts out as a somewhat cocky loner who ends up becoming the military commander of Atlantis after tragically having to kill his commander who was being tortured by a Wraith queen. It's amazing how he transforms himself during the course of season one to adjust to his new leadership role he never sought. The mistakes he makes along the way only makes him more human. The successes he has makes him the reluctant hero. Very well done and the series only gets better over the years. It should never have been canceled.",1374364800,,938,4.656626506024097

What i loved about the show was that it did not copy SG-1 but if fact made it more difficult for them to deal with their situation, where as SG-1 was still on Earth. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who is a SciFi fan and enjoyed Stargate SG-1.",1374019200,,354,4.0
2273677,5,B000980GR0,I really enjoy watching this show. It is my favorite spinoff from the other Stargate shows. The show is a perfrct Syfy\Fantasy.,1373846400,,127,4.818181818181818

2273679,5,B000980GR0,"I love the Stargate SG1 series and spin offs Atlantis and SGU. Atlantis' first season is suspenseful, with a lot of twists and turns as the Stargate explorers venture into the Pegasus galaxy with not enough power to go back home, in the Milky way galaxy.  The Atlantis teams meet the humans of the galaxy making some new friends and some enemies. A new and horrifying enemy... who prey on humans, who are their food source. The Wraith suck the life out of a human, turns them old and then they die. Its a great show with a pretty much great cast.  The Wraith harvest the galaxy like a rancher harvests his cattle.  Except the team from Atlantis has woken all the wraith at once not a small portion of them that should have risen.  Too many wraith not enough humans to feed on. See how the team survive in this strange new galaxy with the technology and the city of the first human race ""the gatebuilders or the ancients""thousands of years old.",1373760000,,943,4.433526011560693

Sorry my fellow Trekies, but my alligance is to Atlantis now. I will forever be a Star Trek fan, but this series is just soooo good. Everything about it is done to perfection. The sounds, story lines, everything! I started to watch the series well after its cancelation. I did not know about it. I was on the fence if I should really watch it. Only because so many other SciFi shows have really been boring for me. Well things changed right after the first episode. Thats all it took. I would highly recommend this series for anyone who enjoys really good action without the Rated R stuff. This show is very family friendly. No sex stuff, nothing that you could not watch with kids around. Its very good like that. I could write forever about how good this series is, I think its time for you to watch it and post a another 5 star review. Enjoy!",1373414400,,998,4.370967741935484

2273683,5,B000980GR0,"If you enjoy the stargate series, you will love Stargate Atlantis. I have watched the entire series several times. The wraith become an interesting foe and at times necessary ally. I enjoy the suspense, action, and chemistry between the cast.",1372896000,,242,5.075
2273684,4,B000980GR0,"I gave this show four stars because it is a well rounded show.  It has adventure, crime, sensual appeal and the story lines have, thus far, been excellent.  The teams work as teams should but , at times , there is friction.  As far as I am concerned that makes the show honest.  Where there is more than one person in any given area for any length of time there will be friction.  The stories have a cohesiveness yet have a certain autonomy.  It is a program I can watch knowing I will enjoy it.

2273768,3,B000980GR0,"This series mirrors the Stargate SG-1 series almost exactly.  At first, it even seems that the main character, Sheppard is even trying to take on the personality of Jack, which is very annoying.  No, they don't have T'ok, but they do have their own tribal character in Tela and a nerd like Daniel in McCay.  Eventually, they realize Tela can't hack it as a replacement T'ok, so they bring in another strong-silent type in the next season.

Also like SG-1, the first season is only mildly entertaining and extremely predictable.  Eventually though, McCay becomes endearing and Dr. Becket's accent carries many of the scenes (until they get rid of him for some inexplicable reason).  If you can make it through that first season though, you'll probably want to watch it until the end.

While again, it doesn't live up to the potential a stargate premise has, it does give you some geeky sci-fi to watch when there's nothing else.

P.S. In the last season, watch out for the clip show masquerading as a judgement on Atlantis and just skip the second to last episode altogether as it has nothing to do with the style, plot, or point of the rest of the season.

The mechanism of the Wraith feeding is the greatest hole which is likely to be quite difficult to fill: seriously, a life energy sucking creature? That seems to belong more in Buffy Vampire Slayer than in a futuristic SciFi show. There a couple cliche plot lines characteristic of this genre, including incorporation of an alien in the team, etc., but they did not seem as unnatural as in other shows, e.g. SG Universe, another Stargate spinoff.  Despite all that, I enjoyed the show. It had very few silly filler episodes about nothing, and even those offered clues or bits of info useful for the unfolding of the story that follows. As I remember SG1's 1st, and especially 2nd, seasons had painfully boring and pointless filler episodes, and Atlantis seems to avoid that practice as much as a show of this nature can. 4 stars, I'll keep watching...",1364083200,,1059,4.949438202247191

Like most spinoffs, Atlantis borrows the same ""freak of the week"" formula as SG-1 only with a new, ever more formidable enemy: the Wraith - like vampires meet the Goa'uld, but without the whimsy. This time, they're in the new city of Atlantis and the new enemy is super strong and its their fault the Wraith are awakened (sorry for the spoiler, but you find this out the very first episode so no real surprise).

Anyhow, the dynamic is a little different and the storylines and arcs unsurprisingly similar to the first few seasons or so of SG-1, but the formula works, the characters are genuine (or at least earnest) and lovable, and the special effects are much better. This show is a close second to SG-1 in my book, but a worthy spinoff. I haven't tackled Universe yet, but we'll see.",1363219200,,836,4.573333333333333

(SGU was not very enjoyable because of too much in-fighting, dishonesty and such.) Characters are likeable and you feel empathy to them.

Good acting. Lot of good special effects. Engaging storyline which keeps you interested. Most of the sets are great, while you occasionally see aspects that don't seem to fit.

As in most cases, there are situations where you wonder why some questions are not addressed. Then again, this is science fiction and some suspension of belief is required. Seriously. This is a series about modern people using an ancient device built by an advanced civilization millenia ago to travel to the far end of the universe to arrive at Atlantis, which turns out to be on a different planet.

I do have a major gripe with the version available for streaming via Prime however, and if there were a way to rate Amazon's service separately for this I'd knock it down to three stars.  (Don't get me wrong though, I do like the Prime service in general; this is strictly about this one show).
The reason?  The streamed version is the one for broadcast, not DVD release (there are blatant inserts for commercial breaks, complete with the title screen), and there are even scenes missing.  I haven't streamed any other episodes yet, and now I'm not sure I will, even if it is convenient when I travel, if it means getting an incomplete experience; this is the series premier, setting the tone for everything coming after, and they couldn't even bother to post the whole thing?!  Some of these scenes aren't major, but they all include dialog and a few contain important plot or character development information that may leave new viewers scratching their heads.

The first season has its duds and awkward moments -- much like its parent series -- but it proves to be a solid introduction to likable new heroes, a legendary city, and a new race of alien parasites.

At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gives the go-ahead for an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis -- even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.

So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. Unfortunately, after ten millennia Atlantis is running out of power, and soon the whole place will flood. The military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), goes scouting for a planet to evacuate to, and encounter the friendly natives.

Meanwhile, the irritable scientist Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) tries to somehow salvage the city -- only to have it rise from the ocean floor. But then the SG teams accidentally wake an ancient enemy -- the parasitic, vampiric Wraith, who destroyed the Ancients long ago. Cut off from Earth, the expedition settles into the Ancient city and tries to make the best of their situation.

Unfortunately, the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- an energy-sucking ""shadow,"" possible spies, life-sucking bugs, a destructive nanovirus, a mysterious goddess, suicidal kids, cannibal Wraith, and an Amishlike people who turn out to be ruthless soldiers. And the Wraith are closing in on Atlantis, intent on getting to Earth -- forcing Weir and Sheppard to arm the city for what may be its final stand.

""Stargate: Atlantis"" has an easier introduction than most series, even spinoffs. The whole idea was introduced over a few seasons of ""Stargate SG-1,"" and two of the characters (Weir and McKay) were also recurring characters. And thank God, there is no endless whining about how they may never see Earth again, as many series would do -- the Atlantis personnel just forge ahead, and deal with it.

It does have some flaws, mostly the same ones that ""SG-1"" had in ITS first season -- a few duds (""The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you""), and many others that are good sci-fi watchin', but not great. It takes a little time for the series to get comfortable, but by the last four or five episodes, it really takes off.

And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror. But it doesn't lose its laid-back style (Rodney massaging his feet during a conference), or its human side -- for example, one episode has everyone recording touching messages to send back to Earth.

And the dialogue is pretty great, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges. Most are from Rodney (""This device must be using an older version of Windows""), and Sheppard (""I am your death. That is all you need to know."" ""I prefer 'Steve'""). But there's humor from everyone (""Find another problem with it! Tell him that the power-loop interface isn't jiving with your walkabout!"").

The cast is a bit uneven -- Higginson is given too little to do, and Rainbow Sun Francks just never works. But Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian sarcastic snap, Hewlett is hilarious as the mildly antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, and Paul McGillion is simply adorable as a cuddly Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell starts off as just the token native love interest, she evolves nicely at the end of the season.

""Stargate Atlantis"" has its shaky moments, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles. But it's a solid first for a solid sci-fi series, gating out into a new galaxy.",1350950400,,4118,4.876967095851216

2273843,4,B000980GR0,">>CORRECTED!<< As of the date of this review, the episode description is incorrect (NOW CORRECT...such as it is).  The following paragraph is my synopsis [NO spoilers]; remaining paragraphs are my review [also no spoilers]:

In the episode ""Thirty-eight Minutes,"" Major Sheppard has been immobilized by a chihuahua-sized insect and is dying. The puddle jumper transporting him back to Atlantis becomes stuck half way through the stargate. Since stargates can remain open only 38 minutes, Dr. McKay, also aboard the puddle jumper, works to free it while other crew members Teyla and Lt. Ford work with Dr. Beckett (who is on Atlantis) to save Major Sheppard in the unlikely event they should make it through the stargate before it closes, killing them all.

It should be noted that I am an unabashed fan of this series, but I didn't like this episode when I first saw it because it takes place primarily in a confined space. This is a personal peeve of mine because I see this style of plot as a ""money-saver"" episode designed to skimp on the costs of effects, new props, and on-location shoots. At this stage in the series, it was way too early, in my mind at the time, to be subjecting us to this type of penny pinching.

Now that I've had some time between my first viewing and my second, I can appreciate it for its true merits. The episode is suspenseful yet the script is typical of the witty banter evinced throughout the series despite the seriousness of the situation. The ""science"" that drove the plot was handled effectively (although I don't know if it violated any known laws at the time of its airing since I didn't see it when it first aired) yet didn't interfere with the story (although, I must admit I have fairly low standards where this type of thing is concerned since I love techno-babble). The actors had their characters well in hand (unlike the pilot).

All in all it was a decent story and worth the hour spent watching it. I still don't prefer these types of episodes, but I did enjoy it more the second time I watched it than I did the first; which is saying something, since I almost skipped watching it because I had disliked it so much the first time.

In fact, with my second viewing I realized that it did have several flashbacks which could have been explained without filming the scenes.  This made me wonder if there had originally been much more to the story that they ended up cutting for time constraints...in which case, I forgive them for subjecting us to the ""money-saving"" appearance of the episode...but now I wonder what the original story might have been...",1341100800,,2602,4.668122270742358
2273844,3,B000980GR0,I hate commercials but I almost would rather have them than just a black screen.  This is pretty silly.  At each commercial junction the screen goes black and lasts for a few minutes.  Then the story pops up again until the next time.  Stargate Atlantis isn't the best sci-fi show ever but it's entertaining enough the first time you watch it.  I really can't recommend the streaming here though.  Maybe Netflix plays straight through.,1340928000,,435,4.8108108108108105
2273845,5,B000980GR0,I've always loved the Stargate series and so far I'm relly enjoying this one. Love the stories and acting and etc etc etc etc. I wish we could have SG-1 in here but you can only have so much of what you want!,1340928000,,208,3.86046511627907

2273847,4,B000980GR0,"This episode, and the rest of the series, are great. However, when I was watching the first episode of this season I noticed that the screen would go black and I figured that a possible explanation was that it was in response to a commercial break. So, you'll watch up until a point when a commercial break will hit and then get stuck with a black screen, instead of watching commercials. Whilst not having to watch commercials is great getting stuck with a black screen for even 2 straight minutes is not, especially when people can compare Amazon Instant Video to Netflix. People, when watching something through this, or Netflix, usually are looking for the episode to play straight through with little or no delay. Meaning, no black screen at all. Personally, I think the people who uploaded these episodes needed to go over them and cut out the black parts. Worse still, I know because I've seen the entire series through Netflix, there is at least one part that was cut out in this series. There was a conversation between Major Shephard and a future friend soldier before he first went through the Stargate at Stargate Command on Earth where, I believe, Major Shephard asked how it felt going through. This was just one I found, there may or may not be others. I would hope not.
Whilst the fact that Amazon provided people with the Stargate Atlantis series is great and I'm very happy I can watch it through here I'd like it more if the people who loaned it, or whatever they did, kept everything that was in the series the way it was, but took out the black screen parts which may be commercial breaks. If they could mimic what Netflix did with the series I would give this series, on Amazon, five stars hands down, especially having HD as well, however, because of this I'm taking a star off.
Thank you Amazon for providing this series to us, but I would like a better job done if possible.
Edit: Someone else already spoke on this topic. Thanks to other person. However, the cut out of the talk between Major Shephard and the other guy in front of the Stargate was one I wanted to see so I'm still disappointed.",1340668800,2,2121,4.526041666666667

I will confirm the disconcerting issues: the opening sequences actually play twice; once several minutes into the content and again after the ending credits. There are several breaks lasting about 3 minutes each, with no transitions, no content, in the episode 1 play.

The entertainment factor and story is done well in the series opener. Parts 1 & 2 flow nicely and builds the suspense! The first 2 episodes set the stage for the remainder of the season and series. So if you can tolerate the poor editing of the first 2 episodes of the Amazon video offering, you will be rewarded for a great SG-1 spinoff saga!",1340496000,,691,4.663934426229508

There they encounter a new civilization that speaks flawless English and warns of the Wraith, a new enemy the explorers don't ask a lot of questions about. Instead, they stumble into a nest of the nasty creatures -- life sucking aliens who also speak English, albeit with a more menacing growl. Not only that, having been warned of how bad, how formidable and how utterly evil these Wraith were, they all split up and into small groups and wake the creatures up! Now they, too, must battle for their lives through five seasons of fun, games and shooting ten-shot Berettas at this new enemy.

As for the episodes themselves, some are as irritating as some of the 60-ish STAR TREKs (WARNING: If they have kids in them...especially with recurring actors...just go to the next episode.) Another minor irritation with Stargate episodes is recurring sets -- sets you saw repeatedly in SG-1 shows!) In some cases you can say, ""Hey, that's the field where that alien ship was buried,"" or ""that's the set where the Jaffa camps were!"" In a new galaxy that's really something you'd expect from amateur film makers with 8mm cameras (before video). But you just have to suspend disbelief. Or belief. Whatever.

In galaxy far far away a more modern adventure takes place. A team from earth travel through an alien device that was left on the planet earth long long ago. The military of course finds and proceeds to manage the device and use it to explore the universe in an attempt to gain new technology in order to defend themselves from threats more close to earth. A military team with various scientists and specialists' travel through the stargate, which transports them to a distant galaxy in which they establish a base of operations in an ancient, abandon city that is far more advanced technologically then anything on earth. The city is found out to be the legendary city of Atlantis. The team quickly finds out that the city doesn't have enough power for a return trip to earth. Yet the city has enough power to visit plants closer to the city they made camp at. During the their first visit to a nearby plant they discover their enemy in this TV show the wrath. The wrath is an alien species that feed on human by absorbing the life force of the human through their hand. It is discovered that the wraths technology rivaled that of the beings that built the city of Atlantis, and it is also discover that it was the wrath that wiped out the builders of Atlantis.
 The main theme of the show is the battle between the wrath and the human team that went through the stargate. Although several episodes are filler and have nothing to do with the wrath. The military branch at the team is a man named Sheppard who was an air force pilot. But his is the typical tough guy but with a sociable sensitive side as well. His is capable of using his gun and also being sympathetic when it is appropriate. The over all leader of the team is a female who is a scientist and has no military training what so ever. She has step outside the traditional female gender role, she is the typical take-charge woman who feels at ease bossing men around. More then once she had to pull rank on the military leader Sheppard. There are also other side characters such as a buff mach warrior that they meet up with and join forces with. And a more feminine yet still fearsome female alien who provide valuable Intel on the nearby worlds. There is also a scientist here and there that provides comic relief.
 This television show is above average ethically compared to most TV shows today. There are minimal sexual images and references. The violence is done tack fully. And the language is minimal. This TV show is geared more toward the younger sci-fi crowd. Being a break off of the hit stargate and was a hit in itself. Overall this show offered minimal points at which to critize ethically of philosophically. The people attempt to preserve life when they can. They do present some religious aspects in this show leaving it open to a transcendent being. Although their version of this being must work through theistic evolution because evolution is a theme in the scientific attitude of the show. They have mixed current scientific belief and monotheism which some have done. It was probably and attempts not to put off either side of the issue to make their viewer base as large as possible.
 The none traditional female role is something that the west has strongly walked away from and it is evident in the female leaders ship of the team. Although the leader does attempt to retain a little femininity and doesn't represent any feministic ideas. Overall this is a fairly clean and more wholesome show then most today.",1267660800,,3518,4.589825119236884

2273868,5,B000980GR0,"Stargate Atlantis seems destined to follow Deep Space Nine in terms of the middle child of sci-fi franchises.  Never particularly famous, and not particularly loved, except the ""hardcore"" fans who will swear it is better than the show from where is spawned.  While I'm sure I'll get plenty of angry comments, I am the hardcore fan who prefers atlantis to SG1.  Why?  Well, Atlantis starts very different from SG1.  For starters, the first season is largely about them learning to understand and adapt to Atlantis, on their own with no help from earth.  They are alone and dealing with a completely new enemy, the awesome Wraith, as well as a few equally evil humans, the Geni.  This feeling of being completely on their own with everything feeling new lends creedence to the ""explorer"" theme of stargate far better.  While I love SG1, I would get tired of the Asgard saving them all the time.  Atlantis has atlantis and themselves, and must make do.

Better yet, this show truly takes from the classic sci-fi of olden days.  Not just the political references, but the stories that you don't see coming from a mile away (well mostly), with interesting twists, and similarly building the characters and stories along the way.

Best of all, the show is just a lot of fun.  I can watch Sheppard and McKay banter all day long.  Frankly, in terms of scientist characters, McKay is easily my favorite of all sci-fi.  He may be a bit of jerk, but his performance is likeably and fun enough to warrant you truly liking the character.  Anyway, I've said too much, but I highly recomend you give this show a try if you haven't the first season sets a great precedent, and is one of the more entertaining shows you'll see.",1252022400,3,1710,4.65

2273872,5,B000980GR0,"I should start by saying that having watched all five seasons, Stargate Atlantis is officially my second favorite science fiction show (the first being Firefly).

The first season starts out a bit uncertainly, but by the middle of the season I was fully engaged in the show and its characters.  Interestingly enough, when I went back later and re-watched the beginning of the series, I loved it!  The bottom line is - if it doesn't hook you at first, keep watching.

Atlantis is not the best written show I've ever encountered, but its characters are among the most endearing.  The acting is excellent as are the special effects, so I'm willing to forgive the choppy writing.  The flaws it suffers from are common ones: uneven character development, characters magically regenerating from devastating traumas and injuries within the space of a week, characters forced out of character for the sake of a story, and so forth.

But putting all of that aside, I truly did fall in love with this show and its characters, who became like a dysfunctional second family.  Some of the highlights:

John Sheppard - team leader and military commander of Atlantis. Highly trained, highly intelligent, snarky, brave, loyal and protective of his team above all else, Sheppard is a semi-suicidal hero with a dark past and disdain for authority. Sheppard's character bio might sound trite, but he is played with such delightful, playful expressiveness and complexity by Joe Flanigan that he becomes much more.  The beautifully acted Sheppard is an endearing, flawed, and lovable leader.

Dr. Elizabeth Wier - overall expedition leader, in charge of Atlantis Base.  Wier initially seems stiff and reserved, but develops into a smart and likable administrator who even has a positive relationship with the normally defiant Sheppard.  A civilian, Wier lends the expedition a scientific and humanitarian aspect.

Dr. Rodney McKay - brilliant physicist and overall tech/science/mechanical genius who is in charge of saving the day whenever Sheppard isn't doing so.  Initially portrayed as a bit of a coward, the insecure, high-strung, arrogant, and self-centered McKay is the show's best layered and developed character.  McKay shows great courage and loyalty in overcoming his fears, and becomes a valuable, endearing member of Sheppard's team.  Despite his arrogance and biting put-downs of co-workers, McKay is also portrayed as one of the most caring and moral people in the expedition.

Dr. Carson Beckett - A highly skilled Scottish medical doctor, Carson is in charge of all things medical and also becomes a more and more integral part of Sheppard's team.  Carson is a deeply compassionate, sweet, and caring person that one cannot help but fall in love with, while an inner strength and occasionally biting retorts keep him from being a cream puff in doctor form.  Carson is one of my favorite characters - ever.

Lieutenant Aiden Ford - initially a team member, Ford's character never quite developed, and was eventually dropped from the show.

Teyla Emmagan - Probably the most cardboard character of the team, Teyla none the less has some great scenes and contributes to the dynamics of the show.  The hot female leader of an alien race of people, she decides that the best bet for her people's future is to leave them and join the Atlantis expedition.  If John Sheppard is the designated eye candy for us female viewers, Teyla is the scantily clad warrior chick for the males.

The Wraith - anorexic goth vampires, AKA the Bad Guys.  These nearly indestructible evildoers farm humans like cattle and feed on them by draining their life force in an excruciatingly painful feeding process.  Fond of vengeance and growling noises, the wraith are the number one enemy of the expedition and of the galaxy as a whole.  The wraith would love to find out where earth is so they can snack on it.

The Lost City of Atlantis - a submerged/floating/flying city filled with endless undiscovered technology.

Along with a well-rounded cast of likable side characters, this team along with some later changes keeps us well entertained for five seasons, at the end of which the show was canceled for no particularly good reason.

I grew to love Atlantis, and I hope you'll give yourself a chance to fall in love with it too!",1240617600,3,4300,5.005625879043601
2273873,4,B000980GR0,"One of the big arcs of the ""Stargate SG-1"" series was finding the Lost City of the Ancients, also known as Atlantis.

It also turned into fertile fodder for a spinoff series (come on, you KNEW they had to make one eventually), known as ""Stargate: Atlantis."" The first season has its duds and awkward moments -- much like its parent series -- but it proves to be a solid introduction to likable new heroes, a legendary city, and a new race of alien parasites.

At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gives the go-ahead for an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis -- even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.

So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. Unfortunately, after ten millennia Atlantis is running out of power, and soon the whole place will flood. The military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), goes scouting for a planet to evacuate to, and encounter the friendly natives.

Meanwhile, the irritable scientist Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) tries to somehow salvage the city -- only to have it rise from the ocean floor. But then the SG teams accidentally wake an ancient enemy -- the parasitic, vampiric Wraith, who destroyed the Ancients long ago. Cut off from Earth, the expedition settles into the Ancient city and tries to make the best of their situation.

Unfortunately, the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- an energy-sucking ""shadow,"" possible spies, life-sucking bugs, a destructive nanovirus, a mysterious goddess, suicidal kids, cannibal Wraith, and an Amishlike people who turn out to be ruthless soldiers. And the Wraith are closing in on Atlantis, intent on getting to Earth -- forcing Weir and Sheppard to arm the city for what may be its final stand.

""Stargate: Atlantis"" has an easier introduction than most series, even spinoffs. The whole idea was introduced over a few seasons of ""Stargate SG-1,"" and two of the characters (Weir and McKay) were also recurring characters. And thank God, there is no endless whining about how they may never see Earth again, as many series would do -- the Atlantis personnel just forge ahead, and deal with it.

It does have some flaws, mostly the same ones that ""SG-1"" had in ITS first season -- a few duds (""The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you""), and many others that are good sci-fi watchin', but not great. It takes a little time for the series to get comfortable, but by the last four or five episodes, it really takes off.

And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror. But it doesn't lose its laid-back style (Rodney massaging his feet during a conference), or its human side -- for example, one episode has everyone recording touching messages to send back to Earth.

And the dialogue is pretty great, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges. Most are from Rodney (""This device must be using an older version of Windows""), and Sheppard (""I am your death. That is all you need to know."" ""I prefer 'Steve'""). But there's humor from everyone (""Find another problem with it! Tell him that the power-loop interface isn't jiving with your walkabout!"").

The cast is a bit uneven -- Higginson is given too little to do, and Rainbow Sun Francks just never works. But Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian sarcastic snap, Hewlett is hilarious as the mildly antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, and Paul McGillion is simply adorable as a cuddly Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell starts off as just the token native love interest, she evolves nicely at the end of the season.

""Stargate Atlantis"" has its shaky moments, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles. But it's a solid first for a solid sci-fi series, gating out into a new galaxy.",1238889600,,4118,4.876967095851216

2273875,5,B000980GR0,"I have always liked the Stargate programs, from the original movie to SG-1. But, while I liked SG-1, I lost interest after about the fifth season. When Stargate Atlantis first premiered, I did not watch it, as so often a good series is beaten to death in attempt by the film companies to milk them for all they're worth. So, I did not actively start viewing Stargate Atlantis until it was well into its fourth season. I was truly 'captured' by the series then, and could not wait to get the seasons I had missed. Thank heavens for dvds! Season 1 is awesome, and Atlantis has brought a freshness back to the story that it had lost.",1234483200,,630,4.3931623931623935
2273876,5,B000980GR0,"I think we have SG-1 to thank for the strong, running start Atlantis was given. Because we didn't have to do what SG-1 did--which was introduce nearly the entire concept of the Stargate to audiences--we had a strong foundation already created for the sister show. However, Atlantis did very well at not closely mimicking its predecessor but taking an idea already created and expanding it, literally, into an entirely new galaxy.

Though I still hold that season 2 is probably the best of all five SGA seasons, season 1 gave Atlantis the strong foundation it needed to become a truly remarkable television series. The characters were strong and evolved over the course of twenty episodes to become people we could really relate with, care for, love, hate, sympathize with, laugh with and hurt for. As I will always openly admit, McKay is my favorite character and I thought he got a great start with episodes like Hide and Seek, The Storm and the Eye, The Brotherhood, Home, The Defiant One and Hot Zone. However, this was also a great season for seeing John Sheppard really come into being as a great character, especially in all the episodes mentioned above. Season one really saw the beginning of what becomes, what I think is, one of the greatest friendships in the Stargate universe.

One of the things that made this season so great (and so different from all the others) is the concept of this team of explorers being completely isolated from their predecessors. With literally almost no ties to the show that began it all, season one of Stargate Atlantis was allowed to come into its own with nearly no interference from the show that began it all. I think that is one of the things that really helped make SGA strong. SG-1 was a great show, one of the best and hard to beat, but we needed to know that we were not just getting a repeat of the first eight seasons of SG-1 set in another galaxy. I think fans were pacified after the first few episodes.

Season one was nearly perfect as an introductory season. The writers, cast and crew did a wonderful job at giving us something both familiar and unique.",1233878400,,2113,4.644385026737968

2273878,4,B000980GR0,"I purchased the 4 season set of Atlantis at Amazon, at an amazing price.

The DVD set
1.  Disc 4 did not work on my Home Theater but it played OK in my DVR.
2.  The menu is hard to understand and there are no scene selection.

The Series:
1  The series is GREAT.
2. It was a bit slow at the beginning, but it picks up by season's end.
3. The special effects are OK, and at times AWESOME.
4. The characters are fun, and a welcome change from the typical SNG, DS9 and Voyager types.  I am a fan of those shows as well.
5. The main villain and secondary threat are very unique.  The main at times we need more background, but I can see how they are flesh out more on season two.  The introduction of the supporting villain is  something to think about for the Atlantis crew.  Not everything is fun in the Pegasus Galaxy and not everyone welcomes humans.
6. Actually I do not understand the language issue.  Everyone in Pegasus speaks English or did they explained this on SG-1.  I know that in the Star trek Universe the communicator works as a translator both ways.  But here is never explained, so it does not sit well with this reviewer.

2273883,3,B000980GR0,"I think the Stargate series (both Atlantis and SG-1) are great. I already had seasons 1-10 for SG-1 and had watched all of the dvd's several times. So I decided to get the season 1 of the Atlantis shows. I purchased the box set from iNetvideo along with other dvd merchandise from other sellers. iNetvideo's shipment was delivered within a couple of days prior to the the deadline date. And the shipment arrived more than week after I had already received the merchandise from the other sellers eventhough the same shipping method was used.

After inspecting the merchandise and playing only the first dvd, I did gave an excellent seller's feedback. When I finally was ready to play the 5th and last dvd I instantly realized that something was wrong. The exact same episodes that are on Disk 1 Volume 1 were on Disk 5 Volume 1. I removed the dvd from the player and looked at the label - the label said Disk 5 Volume 1. I read the DVD case cover and it listed the episodes that were suppose to be on that disk but were not.

Now, how one dvd can get mislabeled and placed into a 2005 box set without a massive recall because other customers experienced the same problem is strange to say the least. My girl friend and I have order quite of few dvd through Amazon's website and this is the first time there has been a problem. I removed the feedback that I had previously give and contacted the seller via the Amazon website about this defect.

After two and no response from the seller, I contacted Amazon. They quickly responded and taking care of the situation with their A-Z guarantee. Meanwhile, I have download the last 4 episodes using Amazon's Unbox feature. I want to view these esipodes and found out what happens. I really like this series - it's as good as SG-1. Great originality in the storylines. There's actiion, humor and sometimes a tear jerker (my girl friend, of course). The characters every once in awhile make a comment about Star Trek (in a good way - I like Star Trek, too).

After I am refunded, I'll be returning the box set to the seller and will probably just download the rest the season 1. Lesson learned - watch all the dvd's before giving a seller's rating.

If you loved the original series... you can watch this, but don't expect the same high quality, competence or intelligence.  The writers are evidently rehashing old sci-fi standard plots, one at a time, without comprehending the basic premise behind the originals. I'm afraid we were yelling at the TV in disgust at one point. Writing characters who wouldn't be able to survive due to being too dumb to live on this world does not make me believe in their ability to make it on another.

It does get better, a little. If you can sit through the worst of it in the beginning they start to manage a couple better episodes towards the end. Now, if we can just some up with a way to assassinate that idiotic commander chick, it might all turn out ok.

Being a huge science fiction fan, I expected to have seen most of it done better before. Well, it's all been done before, but never quite like this. The series takes all the clichs and stock plots, and put its own spin on it entirely. It has charm. It knows its own weaknesses and doesn't hesitate to throw a few wry comments into the cam. The characters are marvellously flawed and realistic most of the time, and delightfully witty to boot. The plots are hackneyed and old, but executed to near-perfection, and strung along into a coherent arc.

2273894,4,B000980GR0,"What is Stargate Atlantis?

Stargate Atlantis is an offshoot of the popular (though now canceled) television show, Stargate SG-1. It follows the adventures of a band of explorers who enter the Pegasus Galaxy through means of an ancient traveling device known as the Stargate. Once there they find themselves in the lost city of Atlantis, and within several hours of setting up base, they tick off the locals, nearly destroy Atlantis forever, are not able to call back home and awaken the most feared and terrible enemy known to mankind, the Wraith.

The team of explorers then come together to create a force against the Wraith, fighting them with all the help Earth is able to give, in terms of both technology and Earth's people, who are shown as caring and brave. They set out to win the hearts of the people of the Pegasus Galaxy, offering help where ever they can, learning new techniques and secrets from a myriad of different cultures and civilizations.

Stargate Atlantis is a very good watch. The graphics are very nice, the characters are sci-fi believable and endearing. The Wraith make for some very good bad guys and the story lines are enjoyable. The first season is a little shaky, in terms of figuring out story-lines and character developments, but all issues are quite grounded by the second season.

It's not necessary to know or have seen the Stargate SG-1 series to enjoy Stargate Atlantis, as the Stargate SG-1 characters make only a brief cameo appearance in the first episodes of this season. However, in the second and third season of Atlantis, they come in quite a bit more. So some knowledge of the SG-1 is helpful, thought still not necessary to enjoy Atlantis.

Little kids will find this show too scary, as the Wraith are a species of albino looking aliens that ""feed""  by draining the life force out of humans. Some of the story lines are a little complex for the younger viewer as well. But what you won't find in Atlantis are scantily clad women bearing their all. One of the things that makes Atlantis an awesome show. Respect for the characters.

 As a connoisseur of Science Fiction, I rate the Stargate series as one of the best on television. Endearing characters, enjoyable story-lines and great graphics all add up to make this the kind of show you want to have in your collection.",1200441600,5,2321,4.741935483870968

A worthy DVD package if you want the first season of the best sci-fi show out there!",1198886400,,346,4.766666666666667
2273896,4,B000980GR0,"One of the big arcs of the ""Stargate SG-1"" series was finding the Lost City of the Ancients, also known as Atlantis.

It also turned into fertile fodder for a spinoff series (come on, you KNEW they had to make one eventually), known as ""Stargate: Atlantis."" The first season has its duds and awkward moments -- much like its parent series -- but it proves to be a solid introduction to likable new heroes, a legendary city, and a new race of alien parasites.

At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gives the go-ahead for an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis -- even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.

So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. Unfortunately, after ten millennia Atlantis is running out of power, and soon the whole place will flood. The military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), goes scouting for a planet to evacuate to, and encounter the friendly natives.

Meanwhile, the irritable scientist Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) tries to somehow salvage the city -- only to have it rise from the ocean floor. But then the SG teams accidentally wake an ancient enemy -- the parasitic, vampiric Wraith, who destroyed the Ancients long ago. Cut off from Earth, the expedition settles into the Ancient city and tries to make the best of their situation.

Unfortunately, the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- an energy-sucking ""shadow,"" possible spies, life-sucking bugs, a destructive nanovirus, a mysterious goddess, suicidal kids, cannibal Wraith, and an Amishlike people who turn out to be ruthless soldiers. And the Wraith are closing in on Atlantis, intent on getting to Earth -- forcing Weir and Sheppard to arm the city for what may be its final stand.

""Stargate: Atlantis"" has an easier introduction than most series, even spinoffs. The whole idea was introduced over a few seasons of ""Stargate SG-1,"" and two of the characters (Weir and McKay) were also recurring characters. And thank God, there is no endless whining about how they may never see Earth again, as many series would do -- the Atlantis personnel just forge ahead, and deal with it.

It does have some flaws, mostly the same ones that ""SG-1"" had in ITS first season --  a few duds (""The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you""), and many others that are good sci-fi watchin', but not great. It takes a little time for the series to get comfortable, but by the last four or five episodes, it really takes off.

And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror. But it doesn't lose its laid-back style (Rodney massaging his feet during a conference), or its human side -- for example, one episode has everyone recording touching messages to send back to Earth.

And the dialogue is pretty great, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges. Most are from Rodney (""This device must be using an older version of Windows""), and Sheppard (""I am your death. That is all you need to know."" ""I prefer 'Steve'""). But there's humor from everyone (""Find another problem with it! Tell him that the power-loop interface isn't jiving with your walkabout!"").

The cast is a bit uneven -- Higginson is given too little to do, and Rainbow Sun Francks just never works. But Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian sarcastic snap, Hewlett is hilarious as the mildly antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, and Paul McGillion is simply adorable as a cuddly Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell starts off as just the token native love interest, she evolves nicely at the end of the season.

""Stargate Atlantis"" has its shaky moments, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles. But it's a solid first for a solid sci-fi series, gating out into a new galaxy.",1197676800,2,4119,4.876967095851216
2273897,5,B000980GR0,"I really like SG Atlantis, I think that it may be better then the SG1 series but that might just be that the raith the villans in Atlantis are much less comical then the gould from SG1, however I missed the mix of history and SCI-FI from the first series. Anyway if you like space and Sci fi stories you will like this series",1197331200,,325,4.09375
2273898,5,B000980GR0,"For quite a long time, I never liked Stargate; but now, after seeing Atlantis, I realize that I was very wrong. Everything about this show is almost perfect--almost perfect acting, strong storylines, and incredible special effects!

First of all, the actors:

Joe Flanigan is great as John Sheppard; he gives the character a wry twist, somewhat like Jack O'Neill but a bit less ironic. Rainbow Sun Francks makes Aiden Ford likeable and goodnatured, but willing to take charge when needed. Torri Higginson is better at playing Elizabeth Weir than her SG-1 predecessor, although her character isn't very interesting until the 14th episode. Rachel Luttrell is calm, cool and collected as Teyla. And, of course, David Hewlett, as Rodney McKay, is both annoying, endearing, and hilarious! As for supporting actors, some of the best are Paul McGillion as Dr. Carson Beckett, David Nykl as Dr. Radek Zelenka, and Craig Veroni as Dr. Peter Grodin.

Each of the episodes are very well written. SPOILERS FOLLOW for anyone who hasn't seen them!

1: Rising. 10/10. This episode starts off the adventure very well, with Daniel Jackson figuring out the riddle of the Lost City. We get to see the city quietly hiding underwater and, even better, erupting upwards in a blaze of sunlight. Colonel Sumner's militaristic personality makes us appreciate Sheppard even more. We meet the Wraith, run away from the Wraith, and in the end realize that we haven't seen the last of them. It sets the stage for the stories to come.

2: Hide and Seek. 9/10. Very, very interesting. Of course, it's regrettable that the whole problem was started by some foolish kids, but otherwise it's great. The entire scene with Rodney and his personal shield is one of my favorites!

3: Thirty Eight Minutes. 10/10. This has a tense feel to it. Sheppard's strength is ever so slowly being sucked away by a hideous bug, but no one can help him because their 'shuttlecraft', the Puddle Jumper, is stuck in the Stargate! Tensions rise and, surprisingly, the whining Dr. Kavanaugh helps more than he hurts.

4: Suspicion. 7/10. Okay, but not one of my favorites. The constant mistrust of Teyla's people, the Athosians, in season 1 gets to be annoying.

5: Childhood's End. 9/10. This episode is pretty interesting, involving a group of children and some more Ancient meddling. Sheppard's team gets in trouble, but ends up unscathed.

6: Poisoning the Well. 7/10. The biggest problem with this episode is the fact that the Hoffans--a people who are willing to die uselessly in order to keep the Wraith away--are not the only stubborn ones in the Pegasus Galaxy. They totally refuse to find a better way to fight the Wraith, and that is quite frustrating.

7: Underground. 8/10. This episode introduces the Genii, militant people who pretend to be farmers and fool even Teyla. Although not one of the best Genii episodes, it's all-around strong, especially with Colm Meaney giving a great performance as Cowen, leader of the Genii.

8: Home. 9/10. The team finds a gate with a supposedly unlimited source of power and thinks they can use it to go back to the Milky Way, but of course problems arise. Surprisingly, this episode is not quite as predictable as you might think! Near the end you slowly begin to realize just what's going on, but throughout the entire episode, you're fully in the dark.

9: The Storm. 10/10. This is one of the best episodes in the series so far. A giant storm threatens Atlantis--they begin to prepare--but they'll have to fight off the Genii first! Rodney and Dr. Zelenka come up with a great way to temporarily defend the city, and Commander Kolya is introduced. A wonderful episode.

10: The Eye. 10/10. The conclusion to The Storm, this is another stellar episode. We see what happens to the city and its inhabitants, and face the Genii. Thankfully, they didn't give the storyline a weak conclusion.

11: The Defiant One. 10/10. In this episode, we first see the Ancient Defense Satellite that's featured later on. On the planet below, a single Wraith has survived for ten thousand years and silently waits... Very nerve-wracking and, in a way, sometimes annoying (i.e. the Wraith figuring the Puddle Jumper out in seconds). Rodney's line to Sheppard: ""What are you, Captain Kirk?"" Great!

12: Hot Zone. 10/10. One of, if not the best, episodes of season 1. A contagion is released inside Atlantis and is almost impossible to stop. We get quite a bit of foolishness from Dr. Weir, however, who refuses to sensibly deal with a situation, making Sheppard eventually have to disobey orders in order to resolve it. Thankfully, that doesn't take away from the adventures in this episode.

13: Sanctuary. 8/10. An interesting concept, but not so great in the end. After a while, the Ancients lose their luster--stupidly refusing to destroy the Wraith and punishing those Ancients who try to. It doesn't help that the entire episode goes by without the Atlantis team gaining any allies or getting a safe haven to evacuate to.

14: Before I Sleep. 10/10. Finally, a Dr. Weir episode that deepens her character! It's too complicated to say much about, but in the end we finally respect and appreciate Elizabeth. A wonderfully complicated time-travel concept helps to add the sci-fi.

15: The Brotherhood. 8/10. Sadly, this episode is just like Sanctuary. It leaves Atlantis with absolutely nothing, all because of Rodney's big mouth. In a way, it's slightly frustrating.

16: Letters from Pegasus. 10/10. This episode is both escapist and intense. Teyla and Sheppard try to rescue some of the former's friends from the Wraith, while everyone else records messages to send to SGC in a quick data-burst. It shows a hidden side of everyone, which helps to deepen their characters drastically.

17: The Gift. 9/10. A secret is revealed, and Teyla becomes even more valuable--in a way. This episode serves to give us more information on her and her people, so it's good to watch.

18: The Siege, Part One. 10/10. A wonderful, tense, horrific, and dazzling episode. The Wraith finally come to Atlantis, despite the efforts of Peter Grodin, an intelligent and likeable British doctor, who's regrettably killed when the Wraith destroy the Ancient Defense Satellite. No one knows if they'll survive, and there seems to be no hope.

19: The Siege, Part Two. 10/10. Just as good as Part One. A group of Marines show up from SGC, bearing somewhat good news, but in the end it seems that even they won't be good enough to stave off the Wraith. It leaves you nervous and very impatient for Part Three!

All in all, Stargate Atlantis is one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen. Even if you've never seen SG-1, you should try to get this. You definitely won't be disappointed.",1192924800,2,6742,4.879265091863517

2273904,5,B000980GR0,"If you enjoy the Stargate SG-1 series, you will enjoy this spin-off.  Being a big fan myself, my biggest concern was that I wouldn't buy into this new look-alike cutting into the original stargate series--I was wrong.  It is almost completely detatched from the original show, has an all new bigger and badder evil race to battle and has more civilian control, which gives the characters' problem-solving strategies a new perspective.  Plus, they're in another galaxy, and the worlds are completely different!

If you've never seen Stargate before, I suggest you check it out...this show takes off at the end of season 7 on the original series.  Watching SG-1 isn't completely necessary in order to follow this show, but it would help a lot.

One thing about the show that isn't so great is that it seems the producers have gotten a little cheaper on the special effects--the CG is pretty obvious and they use a lot of it.  However, being a TV show, I wouldn't really expect special effects on the same magnitude of major motion pictures.

Also, there's the Atlantis movie floating around...if you're buying the season 1 box set, you don't need to buy the movie.  The movie is just the pilot episode, and it's included in the set, so save your money.

2273906,4,B000980GR0,"No, it isn't perfect.  I'm reminded of how awkward some of the very first Star Trek Next Generation episodes were, and compared to that this epic spinoff of an existing epic series gets off to a rip-roaring start.  I love the ""Several Million Years Ago"" scene at the very beginning of the pilot.  I was totally engrossed, and I wasn't disappointed.

Sure, the new cast took some time to grow on me, but I think the reason the cast did grow on me is becuase the show grew the cast during the course of the first season.  I don't expect perfection with a new cast and a new show.  Chemistry can take time.

Of course, at least half the value in DVD sets is the extras.  The commentaries are as entertaining as the episodes themselves, and there is a smattering of additional documentary type features as well.

The one big disappointment was the ""Stargate Set Tour with Martin Wood and Peter Deluise"".  It took about five minutes of the juvenile editing and the stupid jokes about sex and drugs to make me roll my eyes and turn it off.  I really wanted to see the set and learn something.

Also, the DVD menus were meant to be cool but are really just a cluttered mess.  Do I really need an animated mock-up of some futuristic control panel with all kinds of stuff changing all the time and with the episode titles buried in there somewhere?  I like the straightforward menu design of the Stargate SG-1 series a lot better.

The good guys just get by with the skin-of-their-teeth.  Eventually, the good guys win over overwhelming odds (did I just give away the last episode?).

The bad guys, the Wraith (are they trying to get the D&D crowd, here?), look like a cross between the swamp monster and a vampire.  They may not have looks, but they do have everything else.  They are hard to kill, have interstellar travel capabilities, have telepathic ability, have transporters, have phasers, are aggressive, have large numbers, and have beaten the super-race of the ancients.  We get it: they are REALLY tough to beat.

However, I am a sucker for computer graphics and advanced technology.  The CG on this show is very good and the concept of having a treasure-trove of advanced technology goodies to play with appeals to me.  Also, there is alot of stuff to be found on Atlantis, so future, undiscovered goodies are still to be found.

I wasn't disappointed - the show has kept my husband and I interested through all of the episodes we have watched.  We both agree that it's Dr. McKay who makes this show great.

But, back to Atlantis. Totally new characters (except for Weir and McKay), in an amazing new setting, with lots more technology, is a good setup for a great show; which it is. McKay is just as much of a jerk as when his character was invented (the season five episode of SG-1 called ""48 Hours""), and I don't like Dr. Weir that much, but Shepherd is pretty cool and somehow, it all works out. So, where the heck is Season 2?! For some reason the Austrailians get it this November, while those of us in America are getting it ""sometime in 2007."" Oh well.",1163289600,4,821,4.591836734693878
2273924,5,B000980GR0,This is great science fiction and I agree with all of the positive reasons written here.  The cast is absolutely magical with an international quality that adds depth to the drama that unfolds.  Torri Higginson is perfect in the role as Dr. Weir and to think further on this.......I don't see any weak characters in this highly interactive lineup.  The development of Dr. Beckett from a background role to one of the front core characters was a good move by the executives of the show.  Another big plus in Stargate Atlantis is the fabulous Bridge Studios facility in the Vancouver area and the wonderful forest backdrops.  Southwest Canada is perfect for science fiction shows like this.  This is a DVD set for all SciFi fans.,1163030400,3,727,4.776

The extras are even better.  There are commentaries on almost every episode.  Not from just the producers and directors either.  The actors, such as David Hewlitt, do a lot of the commentaries.

2273932,5,B000980GR0,"This marvelous spin off of STARGATE SG-1 does so many things so very, very well.  STARGATE ATLANTIS expands and continues much of the rich mythology built up by SG-1 by delving into greater and great detail into the Ancients.  In fact, looking at the two shows it is safe to say that the Goa'uld storyline that drove the first eight seasons of SG-1 has given way in both ATLANTIS and SG-1 to exploring the Ancients.  In SG-1 this has involved fighting the Ori, who threaten the Ancients as ascended beings, while in ATLANTIS this has involved encountering and fighting the Wraith, the enemy that millennia before caused the Ancients to ascend to begin with.

ATLANTIS was able to hit the ground running in part because of the richness of the mythology created in the parent show and in part because of the number of SG-1 veterans in the production crew.  Most of the ATLANTIS writers also work on SG-1, including Peter Deluise.  One wonders how Deluise manages to find time to sleep, given the staggering number of SG-1 and ATLANTIS episodes that he has either directed or written.

The cast, on the other hand, is a different matter.  Only one regular character was familiar to SG-1 fans, Dr. Rodney McKay (wonderfully performed by David Hewlett).  He had appeared on a few episodes of SG-1 as an exceedingly high strung, grating, but brilliant expert on the physics of stargates.  He instantly became one of the best things on the new show, marvelously blending technical mastery in key plot developments with a host of quirks that makes him equally adept at comic relief.  The most curious casting development was the appearance of Torri Higginson as Dr. Elizabeth Weir.  This was curious because when the character was first introduced on SG-1 at the end of Season Eight, Weir was played by Sci-fi veteran actress Jessica Steen, who did a great job.  I've heard multiple reasons for why Steen was replaced by Higginson, though the one that seems to make the most sense is that Steen declined the role because he would have meant moving to Vancouver.  Whatever the truth, both actresses have performed the role wonderfully, and Torri Higginson is a major asset to ATLANTIS.  The show is technically headlined by Joe Flanigan, who does a great job as Maj. John Sheppard.  He brings a lot of the same qualities to that role that Ben Browder brings to SG-1, though in somewhat less animated form.  Rachel Luttrell is fine as Teyla, an inhabitant of a world they visit shortly after finding Atlantis.  The only problem with the opening credits characters was Rainbow Sun Francks as Lt. Aiden Ford.  One of the soldiers and a member of Sheppard's team (along with McCray and Teyla), his character simply never developed.  It was as if the writers could never figure out what to do with him to make him interesting and vital, and eventually he was more or less written off the show (though he has returned after Season One in guest roles).  There were several other crucial supporting characters, in particular Paul McGillion as Dr. Carson Beckett.  Like Scotty in the original STAR TREK he speaks in a Scottish accent, but his is somewhat honestly come by, having been born in Scotland though raised in Canada.  One actor who doesn't get quite the acknowledgment he deserves is James Lafazanos, who portrays all of the male Wraiths on the show.

The art direction on ATLANTIS is simply outstanding.  The city of Atlantis is brilliantly conceived and fascinating to look at.  Many of the world's they visit are fascinating.  One of the presuppositions of the show is that the Pegasus galaxy, where Atlantis is found, is dominated by the Wraith, vampire like creatures who feed off the life force of humans, but who spend considerable stretches of time hibernating.  As a result, most of the civilizations our heroes visit are considerably less developed than those found by the SG-1 team.  Also, it is a far less rich galaxy, sporting only humans and Wraiths, instead of the variety of races on SG-1.

The first season wasn't perfect, but it was remarkably engaging from the very beginning.  The only real miss was the character of Lt. Ford (the fault of the writers, not the actor).  The season ended with the first two parts of a three-part extravaganza, with a titanic struggle between Atlantis's human defenders against a massive onslaught of Wraith.  The special effects in these three episodes probably surpass anything that was ever done on SG-1 and led to a riveting ending of a great first season.

Many shows have had spin offs, but I think the SG-1/ATLANTIS pair rival any other pair short of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER/ANGEL.  Many spin offs are only lightly coordinated with the original, but that is not the case here.  In Season Two and so far in Season Three the ties between the two shows have dramatically increased and promise to be even tighter in the future.",1154563200,7,4874,4.795209580838323

2273934,4,B000980GR0,"I started watching Stargate Atlantis when it began its syndicated reruns for Season One.  I am a long time Star Trek fan and can't help but make some comparisons.  Although one of the overall arcs of the series is darker than Star Trek (a pending invasion), the style of writing for each episode is light and seems to be more for a general audience relative to Star Trek.  They seem to place emphasis on entertainment over social commentary; however, you may find a lot of the same story formulas (and titles) used in Star Trek revisited in Stargate Atlantis.  It seems to be a very family-friendly series (few sexually explicit situations, if any, but nothing R-rated).  Be aware that some of the 'vampire' aspects of the show may leave younger viewers with nightmares.  All of the characters have good chemistry together and the dialogue tends to be very witty at times (esp. Dr. McKay and Maj Shepperd.)

There are many tongue-in-cheek references to Star Trek (TOS) in this series.  E.g. Major Shepherd compared to Kirk as 'always falling in love with alien women', a Scottish doctor that always seems to end up sounding like Scotty.

The Stargate series is known for their longevity through the ability to keep costs down; however, the special effects are not compromised.

Like others, I started too late to get into SG-1, but watching Stargate Atlantis does not require too much knowledge of SG-1 to get started.  It's a good fix for those of us who are waiting for Star Trek to come back to TV production.",1150761600,3,1512,4.732824427480916
2273935,4,B000980GR0,"Wish I could give a rating of 4.5 for this set of dvds. The episodes themselves are great to re-watch in one fell swoop, but it's the commentary by the various actors and directors and creators that make the set such a fun viewing experience.  Almost everyone involved in the show seems to have gotten involved in the act, and they are funny, witty, intelligent people who care about what they are doing and offer plenty of insights, and much naughtiness, in the commentary.

The show has improved greatly and really found its' footing, not to mention increasing the role of one of my favorites, Dr. Carson Beckett, decreasing others' parts and adding a wonderful new character, Ronan Dex, to the mix in season two, and I will definitely be buying that set when it is released.

This season one set is a highly recommended selection.  It strongly demonstrates the high potential this spinoff promised and has now begun to deliver.

Stargate Atlantis is a fun and interesting television series with very appealing actors, intriguing storylines, great villains, and high production values.",1147737600,6,1087,4.950549450549451
2273936,5,B000980GR0,"This spin-off is awesome, almost just as good as SG-1. The amazing thing about Atlantis is that if you compare their first season to SG-1's first season, this is so much greater(probably because of the fact that the writers are the same and know what they are doing now). The first season of Atlantis is as developed and great as say, the third or fourth season of SG-1. Imagine what it will be like on their sixth or seventh season. One thing lacking is more character development, which was also lacking from the second season, but the writers realized that and they are going to make the third season mainly about characters-with an episode completely about Weir on earth and an episode about Sheppard's backstory and one with McKay and his sister. I really liked Lt. Ford and at first I was kind of dissapointed about what they did to him in the second season, but it grew on me. This is an outstanding season or show in general, when I saw the pilot, I didn't really understand or like it-so I held off on watching the show until the DVD came out, by then I had bought all of the seasons of SG-1 and caught up on the story, I then bought the pilot and loved it, when I saw the entire season I was amazed at how good it was-it is a great show. I recommend it to anyone who likes SG-1 or just loves Sci-fi in general. Sheppard, McKay, and Ford are my favorite characters-I think the new guy, Ronin(introduced in the second season) will grow on me. Great episodes in this season include: Rising p1 and p2, Thirty-eight minutes, Suspicion, Poisoning the Well, Underground, Home, The Storm, The Eye, Hot Zone, Before I Sleep, The Brotherhood, Letters from Pegasus, The Gift, The Siege p1 and p2.

The characters really make this show; they all have very distinct personalities and are quite well written.  Like any TV show, the eps range from okay to very good, fortunately most of the eps are excellent and two ""The Storm"" and the ""The Eye"" are as good as TV gets.

2273938,4,B000980GR0,"If you are looking at this page you are probably already familiar with the show, and if not, the other reviewers have covered the show's strengths and weaknesses completely.

I would like to talk about the dvd set itself.

First off, if you are concerned about the problems some of the others are having with the 5th disc, I read recently that it is a problem only in the Canadian release and not the U.S. release. I bought my copy from amazon. COM (as opposed to amazon. CA) and the 5th disc was just fine. So don't worry about that.

One thing that bothers me about this set is that there are no chapters for each episode except for the ones that let you skip the credits and the reviews of previous episodes. I find that very annoying. Sometimes it's nice to skip to a favorite scene without having to fast forward through the rest of the show to get there.

Also, unlike the dvd sets for SG-1, the dvd's come in the slim dvd cases which hold 2 dvds each. I don't particularly like these cases because I feel if I ever accidently step on one I am going to ruin 2 of my discs. They also don't hold the dvd's very securely and I think over time they will start dropping out of the cases when you open them. Sure, they take up less shelf space, but I'd rather not have to buy another set because a couple of the discs got broken.

The show itself looks great but the graphics they came up with for the beginning of each of the discs are fairly cheesy and not up to the usual standard of quality set by the stargate sg-1 releases.

The set is also a little light on extra's, although I love that there is commentary available for most of the episodes. The cast and crew all seem to have a great sense of humor and genuinely seem to like each other and have fun working with each other. It is very interesting to hear what went on behind the scenes for each episode. If you've never seen the show , don't listen to the commentary until you have seen all the episodes for this season because they do let slip with spoilers for shows later in the season.

BTW, one of the previous reviewers said:

""...you cannot return to the menu if you are in the middle of watching a show.""

That is incorrect; I had no trouble getting back to the menu from the middle of the show.

Still, you don't buy a dvd set to get the extras or a particular type of case, you buy the set for the show and this show is definitely worth the ""price of admission"".

If you're a fan of the show, this is a great set to have. The set also include the two-hour kickoff show, so you don't need to buy that separately.

However, I have some criticisms of the DVD set itself. I think it was cheaply made, because you cannot return to the menu if you are in the middle of watching a show. So if you lose track of which episodes you've already seen on a disc and start to watch one you've already seen, you must fast-forward to get to the end of the show so you can get back to the menu and pick a different one. That wastes a great deal of time.

I like that the people who made the set tried to come up with an interface that looks like what you'd get if you were flying a puddle jumper. However, they made it too confusing. I still haven't been able to find out if there's a commentary track for each episode, like there is for many of the ""Stargate SG1"" episodes on DVD.

If I could give half-stars, I would give it a 3.5 because of all the difficulties in actually using the DVD. The shows, however, rate a 4 or 4.5. I just love scifi, and ""Stargate Atlantis"" is shaping up to be a good show.",1142985600,5,1333,4.095785440613027

Stargate Atlantis premiered the year we finally got cable, and we were fans from the first episode, due largely to the wit of Rodney McKay. However, from the very first episode I have been driven nigh unto insane by one heretofore unexplained aspect of the show: How on earth (or Atlantis) does the team understand any of the people they come into contact with?? Come on, at least make SOME attempt to explain it! Perhaps they covered this on SG-1 and assumed all fans of Atlantis would be carrying over? I mean, is is a Universal Translater ala Star Trek? Translator drone thingies ala Farscape?

The star gate is digital and the entire setup seems more modern that the standard stargate.  The crew interact on several occasions with the original cast but the storyline is focused on staying alive in a hostile environment while in another galaxy, the Pegasus system.  The life sucking Wraith's want to take Atlantis so they can gate to Earth for a new feeding ground.  The players try to survive while unlocking the secrets of Atlantis and the Ancients, all while have a good plot line for each episode, which includes gating to other worlds and meeting new people.

This series might not be as enjoyable to anyone who is not familiar with the SG1 series.

My only problem with the series is that year 2 is not available so I can see how they survived the latest attack in the typical ""to be continued"" episode.

2273949,5,B000980GR0,"Anubis has been defeated (again), and a team of scientists flocks to the Antarctica base that was discovered in episodes of Stargate SG1. Daniel Jackson (of course Daniel would be there, since it's the archeological find of the century) and Dr. Elizabeth Weir ((seen in episodes of SG1 as a harried woman being shoved around by the odious Senator Kinsey. This Weir is played by Torri  Higginson of ""The Englsh Patient"" fame, not the washed-out blond featured on SG1. IMHO, a great improvement. Higginson plays Dr. Weir as strong, bold, and driven)) scour the base for what they hope will be there: the Stargate coordinates for the famed lost city of the Ancients: Atlantis.

Assissting the exploration team are Dr. Rodney McKay (already seen several times in SG1; no, he hasn't gotten any humbler), played by David Hewlett, who has truly brought McKay to real life instead of being a once-in-a-while guest character on SG1, and Dr. Carson Beckett, played by Paul McGillian, who's really been given the chance to fly in this role, instead of being a bit player in small budget movies. Beckett is the chief medical officer.

McKay and Beckett are sort of the 'Laurel and Hardy' of the team. They play off wonderfully to each other, creating a comic relief pair. Anyhow, in the first episode, at Antarctica base, McKay is hounding Beckett to sit in The Chair ((previously used by Jack O'Neill to release and direct the torpedo-like weapons that ultimately destroyed Anubis' fleet)). Only people who have the 'ATA' ((Ancient Technology Activation)) gene in their DNA can operate the Chair ((O'Neill was practically the first person to be discovered as having the gene)). Beckett has the gene, but he's very reluctant to use or activate Ancient technology. McKay, who'd kill have the gene, doesn't. ((""Rodney, I break things like this!""))

A few hairy scenes occur, then General Jack O'Neill's helicopter lands at the base, flown by one Major John Sheppard, a protege of O'Neill and brilliantly played by Joe Flanigan. At first, Sheppard is a spacey kinda guy, all grins and quips ((he's a lot more serious later)). Sheppard has no idea that the Stargate Program exists, until he's swept up and given a tour by the enthusiastic Lieutenant Aiden Ford ((Rainbow Sun Francks, and I have to wonder if his parents were hippies or just really weird/mental)). (-apologies to Rainbow if that sounded offensive; it's just that I'm extremely curious about the story behind his name).

In the course of events, Sheppard sits on the edge of The Chair and the device instantly responds to him ((as opposed to Beckett, who is slow to use the gene, and the technology is slow to respond to)), proving that he has the ATA gene, and is swept up by Dr. Weir to be a part of the Atlantis team. ((O'Neill: ""I thought I told you not to touch anything!"")).

Of course, it's Jackson that discovers the key to get to Atlantis, and the Atlantis expedition is given the green light to go. Atlantis is dark and silent ((and underwater)), as the team exits the Stargate.

More hairy times, then the Athosians are found, people willing to be allies of the people from Earth. ((I'm being oblique because I don't want to spoil the action for you)).

Teyla Emmagen ((played by the lovely Rachel Luttrell)), the nominal leader of the Athosians, is the one who gives the bad news to Sheppard and the others. Her galaxy is plagued by an  enemy even more terrifying than the Goa'uld or the Replicators: the Wraith.

This series is packed with mystery, adventure, and fast action. What I loved most about the collective DVDs is that they feature two episodes that had ""cliffhanger"" endings, and the second episodes to the cliffhangers are included. The episode ""Thirty-eight Minutes"" is poignant enough to bring tears to anyone's eyes, while ""Hide and Seek"" brings hilarity and bone-chilling fear.

2273950,4,B000980GR0,"It looks like it is not just the Milky Way galaxy where English is the universal language. It looks to be pretty common in the Pegasus galaxy as well.

Stargate Command decides to send an expedition to Atlantis. This is a dicey proposition because if the expedition cannot find more of the ZPM crystals, they will not have the energy to return. It could well be a one way mission. That sets up this spin-off series with its main premise. An expedition from Earth is stranded in a high tech environment.

The series needs more than that, of course and it has it. Instead of the Goa'uld, they find a new adversary even nastier. These are the Wraith, a race which feeds on the life force of humans. They are a constant threat and the danger is that they may get access to Earth's home galaxy. That would not be good.

This series is not as much fun as the original Stargate. The chemistry between the main cast members is not as good as in the original. There is also something of the macabre about it all. Still, it is interesting enough and it is watchable.

Episode synopses appear below:

Rising Parts 1 and 2 - Daniel Jackson thinks he has finally figured out the location of the Ancient's city of Atlantis. It is in another galaxy. To get there will require using up the last ZPM crystal the earth has left. Because the potential payoff is so great, BG O'Neill is willing to take the risk and send a large group through. It is a one way trip but the hope is that power crystals will be found on the other side. They find Atlantis and it is indeed located under the sea. Their arrival, though, drains most of the power left in the local crystals and the city is in danger of imminent drowning. Now the Atlantis team must use the local gate to find another world to inhabit. The Ancients are gone. They were wiped out by a terrible enemy. Unfortunately, the planet visited by the expedition is being attacked by these new bad guys. They are called the Wraiths. These same wraiths captured a part of the expedition. Now, the SG Atlantis team needs only to learn to use the Ancient technology and rescue their compatriots from the wraiths who would eat them. Eat might not be the exact right word. They ""eat"" the life force, aging the victim. Even worse, they are not even the main threat.

Hide and Seek - The Atlantis crew is still trying to settle in to their new city but they have some problems in that many of the gadgets need to be activated by a person with a rare gene. Dr. McKay finds a device he believes to be a personal shield and agrees to try an experimental gene therapy treatment to see if he can use the device. It works but there is a problem. He is invulnerable but nothing can get through the shield. That includes food and water and even his own hand. He cannot turn the device off. Meanwhile, some of the kids get themselves into trouble when playing hide and seek. One disappears. Not long after, people start seeing strange shadows and rumors of hauntings and general spookiness. The kid playing hide and seek has unwittingly let loose an energy being imprisoned since the time of the Ancients. Now it is feeding on the energy of the base and all are in trouble. Defeating it will take some uncharacteristic bravery on the part of McKay.

Thirty Eight Minutes - The Atlantis team carries out another recon of the Wraith planet. While there, they are ambushed and barely make it back to their shuttle. The shuttle sustains some damage and Maj. Sheppard is not much better off. He has been attacked by a giant, parasitic bug which has attached itself to his neck. Nothing they can do will make it dislodge itself and it is feeding off of his life force. The shuttle team has problems too. One of the engines didn't retract all the way and, as the ship tries to transit the wormhole, it gets stuck, part in and part out. Now time is running out. The wormhole will only be stable for 38 minutes. After that point, it shuts off and kills everyone.

Suspicion - Atlantis recon teams continue to encounter Wraiths on most of their missions. This happens even in the most unlikely and uninhabited places. Suspicion grows that there is a traitor or an agent among the refugees they have living with them. They are restricted in their movements and barred from use of the Stargate. Naturally, they resent this. Eventually, they move on to settle a land mass on the Atlantis planet. Still, the Wraiths seem to be getting information of the movement of the Atlantis teams. There is someone giving info to the enemy but it is not a traitor.

Childhood's End - While on a recon mission, the puddle jumper crashes and all electronic equipment ceases to operate. The team is then captured by a bunch of children. None of the locals is over 25 years of age. They believe that by killing themselves on their 25 birthday, the Wraiths are not attracted to their people. It is human sacrifice. The actual reason that the Wraiths do not return is more complex. There is a hidden device which messes up the electronics and keeps the Wraiths away. The device is powered by a ZPM crystal, the same type of crystal the team originally set out to find and which powers everything needed. Taking the crystal dooms the kids. Hotheads among the kids want to kill everyone just to be on the safe side. It is a nasty moral dilemma.

Poisoning the Well - The Atlantis team finds a planet with a fairly high level of technology. It is still behind the Earth's but it shows some promise. The people of the planet store their knowledge in huge libraries to help them rebuild after each harvest by the Wraiths. They are on the verge of developing a vaccine that will render victims immune from the wraith feeding. With the help of the Atlantis team, they actually make a viable vaccine. When it is tested on the wraith prisoner, it does more than expected. It also poisons the Wraith. This sounds good but the Atlantis crew fears that when the Wraiths learn of this, they will wipe out the entire planet to keep the knowledge of the vaccine from spreading. The politicians are adamant, though that the populace must be inoculated. Things get ugly when those inoculated start dying also.

Underground - The Atlantis team heads out on a trade mission to a planet known to Kayla as simple, Amish style farmers. These guys drive a hard bargain and Shepherd has to go back to get authorization from Dr. Weir. When he comes back, he stumbles into a great secret. These are not the simple farmers they pretend to be. They have a hidden, underground civilization secretly working on a plan to fight the Wraiths. They think they can get an edge by getting more Atlantis technology. The problems, however, are multiple. The plans count on hibernating wraiths and the locals are unaware that the sleeping Wraiths have been wakened. A bigger problem, though, is that neither side really trusts the other. The biggest problem, however, is that these people are NOT trustworthy.

Home - Dr. McKay is an obnoxious and arrogant @$$ but he is a smart one. While the Atlantis team is investigating a new planet, they find a Stargate that is drawing an incredible amount of power right from the atmosphere. He thinks he can establish a wormhole back to earth with it. He is right and all of the leading characters report back to Earth to let the home folk know what is going on. They intend to return on the Prometheus but a problem develops. There is an accident on the ship and the leadership seems to be stuck on earth. The problems are worse than that, though. Each of the leadership seems to be having differing experiences that don't mesh with the others. It is quite confusing to the viewer for a while but it seems that each one is being thwarted in all attempts to get back to Atlantis base. The reason for this is simple. They are not on earth. Someone has a vested interest in keeping them from getting back.

The Storm - An incredibly huge storm threatens Atlantis. This is the type that only occurs every few centuries. It is so bad that Dr. Weir decides to evacuate temporarily to another planet. Finding a planet, though, proves difficult. Most people don't like to have well armed, technologically superior people running around in large numbers. A deal is struck, though, and it looks like everyone will make it to safety. The problem is that the ""hosts"" betray the problem to the Genii, the planet of untrustworthy humans who wanted A Bomb technology 2 episodes ago. They put together a strike team and seize control of Atlantis while most of the people are gone. They manage to capture most of the senior officers except for Maj. Sheppard. The episode ends with a hostile and tense standoff needing to be resolved in the next episode.

The Eye -Most of Atlantis has been evacuated because of a killer storm. A Genii strike force has seized the Atlantis and holds most of the command team from Atlantis hostage. Atlantis looks to be completely wiped out by the storm unless McKay and Weir, two of the hostages, can use lightning from the storm to power the city's shields. Maj. Sheppard is on the loose playing commando and trying to take back the critical functions while saving the lives of the hostages. A few people caught on the mainland in a puddle jumper during the storm are all the allies he has. It's a race against the clock and killer waves. It's an exciting episode.

The Defiant One - An Atlantis scientist discovers something interesting at one of the Lagrange points. It is a satellite and a moon. They also hear a distress signal...a wraith distress signal. When they go to investigate, they find a wraith supply ship. They assume that after 10,000 years, there must be no survivors. They are wrong. The Wraiths are a hardy and persistent species. The Wraith survivor is also very hungry. That means a bad day for the expedition. The last news that the Wraith has heard was that the Wraiths had Atlantis under siege. Now, Maj. Sheppard tells him that the Wraith lost the war. That does not stop him from trying to steal the ship though. It's another race against time as the Wraith tries to eat everyone and escape and the Major tries to kill the wraith and hold out for the relief force.

Hot Zone - After the big storm the Atlantis crew is looking the city over to ascertain damage. While a ways of from the HQ, a few of one of the survey teams starts having terrifying visions. After a few such visions, the affected person dies of a cerebral hemorrhage. When others start to be affected, a quarantine and lockdown is instituted. An Ancient virus has been accidentally released. Unfortunately, one of the party got away in his panic and has affected lots of others. Now panic is running rampant as some people are frightened of the virus and others are frightened of the visions. Now McKay, who is infected himself, must figure out a cure. He has a few hints but its going to mean some risks.

Sanctuary - While on a survey in a Puddlejumper, Maj. Sheppard and his team come under fire from Wraith ships. It doesn't look like they are going to make it but, suddenly, all the Wraith ships are destroyed by some weapon from the planet below them. That sounds like technology, or at least some energy crystals, which Atlantis desperately needs. When they get to the planet surface, they find a peaceful and pastoral culture with little sophistication and no high technology. They all share a common religion, though. In an effort to learn more, Sheppard seeks out a ""priestess"". She is intriguing but declines to offer sanctuary. She does come back to Atlantis for a visit, however. There, she seems too perfect and too good to be true. That is because she is not what she seems. Without knowing it, the Atlantis crew has found someone for whom they have been desperately seeking. They have found her but she will not help.

Before I Sleep - While exploring new parts of the city, a team stumbles onto a stasis chamber with a live but extremely old inhabitant. They believe this to be one of the Ancients. When the sleeper is revived, however, the crew of Atlantis is in for a shock. The sleeper is Dr. Weir, another version of Dr. Weir who has been asleep for 10000 years. She is in frail health and not expected to last to long but she has information to impart. In her reality, the arrival of the Atlantis crew started a fatal series of events that destroyed the city. In a last ditch effort to escape, she and a few others got aboard one of the puddlejumper ships and found themselves in a battle with the wraiths. As they desperately tried to figure out the controls, they activated one which sent them back in time 10000 years to the Ancients. There the battle with the Wraiths was raging also and all are killed but her. The Atlantians are about to evacuate to Earth and they invite her to go with them. Instead, she chooses to enter stasis so that she can replace the power crystals of the city as needed over her long sleep.

The Brotherhood - It looks like the information on ZPM energy crystals brought back by the alternate Dr. Weir in the previous episode might bear some fruit. They find a planet where one of the ZPMs was venerated by an ancient religious brotherhood who regarded the Ancients as gods. The brotherhood was destroyed by a Wraith culling. Now, the Atlantis team must figure out where the brotherhood hid the ZPM. They can do it but there are a few problems. The Genii commando leader who captured Atlantis a few episodes back is aware of what they are doing and he has his own plans to capture the device. The plans do not take into consideration the wishes of the current occupants of the planet. Worst of all, a Wraith fleet is headed towards Atlantis.

Letters from Pegasus - It looks like the entire Wraith fleet is on its way to wipe out Atlantis. Things are looking grim and the leadership team decides to risk using every available amount of power they have in order to open a wormhole back to earth for a few seconds and send a message warning about the Wraiths. They are able to compress all of their data into a small burst. There is still some time left over for people to send personal messages. So it is that we have a retrospective episode with flashbacks. There is a little bit of story, however. Maj. Sheppard heads out in a puddlejumper to do a recon on the Wraith route of advance. They encounter the Wraith on a feeding expedition at a planet and it seems they have a new weapon which Sheppard goes out to investigate. That gives Kayla the opportunity to try and save a few people and thereby endanger the entire expedition when there is not enough room to take a whole planet.

The Gift - As the Wraith fleet draws ever closer, the Atlantis crew continues to seek other locations to which they can evacuate. While this is going on, Tayla is experiencing terrible nightmares of the Wraiths. She has the ability to sense their presence and she believe these nightmares are somehow connected to that ability. Matters get worse when the dreams begin to star her as the wraith. This experience leads her to investigate why she has this ability that so few of her people have. She learns that it is because of a genetic experiment conducted by the Wraith long ago. She has some wraith DNA. This gives Atlantis some advantage. If she can channel this ability, she should be able to gather invaluable intelligence. Unfortunately, the link works both ways. The Wraith have a much bigger goal than Atlantis.

Siege Part 1 - The episode is about contingencies as Atlantis awaits the coming of the Wraith fleet. Part of the crew keeps looking for sites on which to evacuate. Part searches for a way to destroy Atlantis to keep it from falling into the hands of the Wraith. Part tries to salvage as much information as possible. Dr. McKay, the arrogant ass, comes up with a possible solution. He thinks he can use a naquada generator to power up the old defense satellite from earlier in the season and heads out to try and power it up. Things are not going smoothly. Dr. Weir cannot decide what she wants to save. The local evacuees don't want Atlantis to be destroyed because it is an artifact of the Ancients they venerate; they don't care about earth. The Wraiths have a hidden agent aboard Atlantis and suspicion turns towards Kayla. McKay manages to get the weapon working partially but it is not as effective as would be wished. The Wraith are still closing in.

Siege Part 2 - Just as Atlantis is about to be evacuated, help arrives from Earth. An arrogant marine colonel shows up with some techno toys and relieves Dr. Weir. He also manages to alienate just about everyone with whom he comes in contact. The toys brought with them are not enough to defeat the Wraith but they are enough to (probably) hold them off for a while. This is helpful because more help is on the way. The Daedelus is on its way from earth with a newly discovered ZPM crystal to power the first line defenses.  It's a near run thing. The new toys work but they don't work as well as hoped. The Wraith are still closing in and they manage to land some troops on Atlantis itself. There is a possible way to hold out but it involves the cooperation of the Genii. They have never been known for their ability work and play well with others. The plan looks like it might work until power levels drop too low. The solution is a suicide mission with Maj. Sheppard as the star performer. The season ends with the outcome of the battle in doubt.",1140566400,24,17460,4.525031685678074

Of course I have read the reviews here at Amazon, and I am extremely disappointed (although not surprised) at the lack quality control under Sony Pictures management.

===> Check your Disk 5 of the set, November 15, 2005

Reviewer: Lost ""Mind"" (Regina, Canada) - See all my reviews

A store in Regina, Canada released the set early, last Thursday. When we got to Disk 5, we found that the contents were the same as Disk 1, namely, the first four episodes. Naturally, we contacted Sony (who now owns MGM). Their reply was twofold, first, they do not deal with ""defective"" disks, their policy is to return it to the store. Second, they stated there were no known issues with this title.

The second part surely is true, the store released it early! Today, with the official release, I checked 5 other retailers, having them open the box and play Disk 5, telling them what I found. In every case, it was the same, Disk 5 has the same contents as disk 1 and is therefore missing the last 4 episodes.

Over to you Sony.

<====

Amazon posted a note to me (top of my shopping cart) that ""Stargate Season 8 and Stargate Atlantis season 1 prices have increased"",  since I placed them in my shopping cart.

WELL I AM WAITING FOR SONY TO ANNOUCE A RECALL AND CORRECTION NOTICE.... AND POST THE NOTICE HERE AT AMAZON BEFORE I BUY.

BUYER BEWARE ... RIGHT!?!!!

I do not want to send away to get disc 5 corrected.

And while they are at it, Sony should add a disc with the full-length version of the shortened episode.

Who agrees with me?",1135209600,16,1769,4.410493827160494
2273962,5,B000980GR0,"As Rodney utters when Sheppard becomes smitten by the lovely guest star, Leonor Varela in the episode Sanctuary.  This isn't just to poke fun at another Sci-Fi institution, as the writers must clearly see the similarities to that popular franchise.  While the show is a spin-off of Stargate SG-1, it is vastly different, and in my opinion, much closer to a Star Trek series than a parallel to SG-1.

The one main similarity the show maintains with SG-1 is that these are modern day, Earth citizens getting into these futuristic, sci-fi adventures.  This aspect makes it very accesible to even the casual sci-fi viewer, as they can easily relate to the main characters, rather than have to rely to much on imagination and future machinations.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love SG-1, but one aspect of the show that seems to weigh it down a bit are a lot of the military base scenes on Earth, with the dull board rooms and office scenery.  Not that I mind non-action sequences, but I think the backgrounds are rather unappealing.  There is nothing like that on Atlantis, as we have new ""Ancient"" scenery galore on this mystical cityscape.

Out of the 20 episodes on this DVD, not one is a dud.  I enjoyed every one, and while a few were somewhat boring, the performances and the building storyline of the season kept my interest rather well.  The first real episode was a slower one, and almost got me thinking that nothing was going to be as good as the stunning pilot, but then I was hit with the incredible tension of the episode Thirty Eight Minutes.  Sheppard and crew are stuck in the Stargate with half the Jumper in and half out, and Sheppard has a life sucking spider on his neck.  This one was excellent.

More good episodes abound, including the highlight of disc 2, Childhood's End.  It's a storyline that's been played out in sci-fi dozens of times before (ritual suicide at a young age) but this one is done well, with particularly good performances by the guest actors.  In the last episode on Disc 2, we meet the only other real enemy of the Atlanteans other than the Wraith, the Genii, led by a familiar face in sci fi: Colm Meaney.  We get more of the Genii in season 1, including the two part story arc The Storm and the Eye, but Colm Meaney's character gives way to an equally talented villain, Robert Davi.

Disc 4 has two great episodes in Before I Sleep and The Brotherhood.  The former being a dual role for Torri Higginson, playing her older self, and she gives a powerful performance in the older role, almost better than the way she plays the normal Weir!!  No, I like Dr. Weir, I just think she hates being talked out of her orders by Sheppard and comes off as bitter.  In fact, the reason I gave Atlantis a try, was because I liked her performance as Weir in the Season 8 opener of SG-1.  She was much better than the actress who played Weir at the end of SG-1's Season 7.  We also get a neat, Indiana Jones, treasure hunt type episode in the form of Brotherhood, as they have to find where the 15 Brothers hid the ZPM using all sorts of clues and stones left behind, all the while with the dreaded Genii on their trail.

We end the season with the build up of the dreaded Wraith heading to Atlantis, wanting to use it to gain access to the wormhole back to Earth.  I like the Wraith as an villain race, and think they were used just about the right amount through the first season.

Overall, I think season 1 was an excellent first season, and one of the best for any sci-fi show.  While I haven't seen any of Season 2 yet, I have seen and read about a lot of changes including 2 new cast members, and the departing of Lt. Ford.  I am not sure why this was done so early in the show, but tinkering with something that seemed so good, may be a mistake.  Not many successful shows have a drastic change at the end of the first year.  Most are consistent for the first few years: just look at SG-1, which went 5 seasons before the first main cast change.

Back to the Star Trek similarities.  Let's see, you have a macho leading man, who enjoys romancing alien priestesses (John/James T.), a stubborn doctor (McKay/McCoy), a Scottish crew member (Carson/Scotty), a non-Earthling lead crew member (Tayla/Spock), a solid action man (Ford/Sulu), and a setting that takes them to alien worlds (Atlantis/Enterprise).  In Trek they traveled by ship, where here they travel by wormhole.

Whatever the similarites to SG-1 or Star Trek, I enjoyed every bit of this new sci-fi show.  The cast, storyline, and setting are all superb.  There is lots of good sci-fi entertainment that can come out of this, let's hope it doesn't go downhill with season 2.

One last note, there is absolutely no reason why there shouldn't be chapter stops throughout every episode.  This is very annoying.  I've bought half hour kids' DVD's that have a dozen chapters in them!",1134691200,8,4870,4.504555808656036
2273963,3,B000980GR0,"Make no mistake, the Stargate premise is great and having watched this entire series in a matter of days I would have to say that for me it never rose to anything like it's full potential.

Some of the plots are quite thin, some very soapy and others excellent. Some of the camera shots and footage is used repeatedly and there is a lot of repetition throughout the series. The characters, after 22 hours of viewing remain shallow.

Ultimately, the main point of conflict only develops in the last 2 episodes and even at that, we're left at series end with a ridiculously cheap cliffhanger. This defines the series - rack 'n' stack, hope for the best. This excellent concept is now incidential to the needs of the producers.

This box set won't be added in my library!",1134086400,4,768,4.550724637681159

(not fighting gould(sp?) all the time) The actors they picked are great, everyone is fun and loveable. There are some characters that don't appear as much in some of the eppisodes, but its ok because they have their spotlight on other eppisodes. The new army guy with his O'neil-esque attitude toward the science of things, is great and not a cheezy character rip-off; he's dumb in his own way. :) The whole idea of this show is like a upgrade from stargate, well more of a ""we have advanced technology but don't know what to do with it"" compared to the ""we have primitive earth stuff, and some high tech stuff here and there"" type of setting.

I actually enjoyed the commentary, unlike some of the SG-1 commentaries where they seem to talk just to be able to say all or most of the episodes have commentary.  I haven't listened to the other commentaries but this is the set to get for good commentary, logic says, because the series is new and they have stories as yet untold.  Also, I just got confirmation that the U.S. sets are fine.  It is the Canada sets and only the Canada sets that have the disc 5 problem.",1132185600,4,537,4.448979591836735
2273968,4,B000980GR0,"As far as I am concerned, this boxed set is at the higher-end of mediocre spectrum.

In the show, The Ancients, the builders of the stargates and ancestor of modern humans left in a city-ship called Atlantis to the Pegasus galaxy and never returned.  10 million years later, an international team of scientists and military go on a one-way trip to Pegasus and discover the city underpowered, underwater, unihabited and hidden from Pegasus' version of thte Goa'uld: The Wraith.

PROS: The interior design and cover art is pretty good (in contrast to the box cover).  There are 4 episodes per disc, and each one is in 1.78:1 aspect ratio; the episodes themselves are 1.5-1.6GB in size, the same size as the disappointing MACGYVER boxed set episodes, but definitely better.  The sound, image, color and transfer is crisp, clean, smooth and polished with pixellation visible at 40X magnification.  Beautiful.  Audio commentaries on plenty of episodes even though I haven't listend to them all yet.

CONS: The cover box art is disappointing; I'd expect that design from overseas collections.  There are no bonus features aside from obligatory and sparse production documentation, so bloopers, deleted scenes and the like are out.

WORST: Forget about skipping through episodes to get to your favorite parts: THERE ARE NO CHAPTER STOPS PAST THE SHOWS INTRODUCTION; skip ahead from chapter 3 and you'll end up at the credits.

*NOTE* Reports about a Disc 5 glitch have been listed: allegedly, some sets may contain a Disc 5 that has Episodes 1-4 RE-printed on it instead of 17-20.  My set is fine, but you might want to look into this report.

These things and the final one especially stripped the 5th star from my review.

Other than that, this is one of the better spin-offs and this is definitely one of the better Season 1's you'll find (thanks to franchise budgets).  The quality of the image, compactness of the box and tone of story make this set worth the buy.",1132099200,6,1962,4.885196374622357
2273969,3,B000980GR0,"A store in Regina, Canada released the set early, last Thursday. When we got to Disk 5, we found that the contents were the same as Disk 1, namely, the first four episodes. Naturally, we contacted Sony (who now owns MGM). Their reply was twofold, first, they do not deal with ""defective"" disks, their policy is to return it to the store. Second, they stated there were no known issues with this title.

The second part surely is true, the store released it early! Today, with the official release, I checked 5 other retailers, having them open the box and play Disk 5, telling them what I found. In every case, it was the same, Disk 5 has the same contents as disk 1 and is therefore missing the last 4 episodes.

Over to you Sony.",1132012800,14,731,4.367647058823529
2273970,5,B000980GR0,"I rated the series, not the dvds so, please! Can someone whom actually bougth the dvds, tell me if Rising is part of this set???

Aside of that. I think if you haven't watched a series on tv (any series), you could do a big mistake buying a set of dvds of a show you may hate.

I think SGA is excellent, and I can't wait to buy every season from now on (like I've bought Stargate-SG1 among other series and movies). But that's just my opinion. No matter how good or bad the writting, the characters, the conflicts on the series are, what finally matters is that you feel you want to watch it over and over, or not.

Unless you trust someone else opinion with all you heart, I suggest you watch any show, or movie, before buying it.

2273971,4,B000980GR0,"There have been several good, in-depth reviews of this show already posted by others here. Not much to add... only this;

Stargate Atlantis is a great show, an evolution of the Stargate world, but not revolutionary. I never miss an episode, I like the cast (though basically getting rid of Rainbow was wrong imho) and the storylines are excellent. BUT, there is room for improvement. I'd like to see more romance evolve, I'd like to see the humans go on the offensive against the wraith, and I'd like to see a few cross-over episodes each season.

Seeing as how this is supposed to be a review of the DVD box set I would say that if you haven't seen this show before its an inexpensive way to buy many hours of entertainment for those cold winter nights, or maybe even a few marathons on the cold, snowy weekends. If you buy this DVD set you will want to tune into the SciFi channel to catch up with season two. You will more than likely become a fan of the show.

If you already watch the show and are thinking of collecting the series on DVD the price is excellent. I like to think of it this way; when I retire and have the time to spend watching great films and TV shows that I loved, having these sets is comforting. And lets not forget the times you might think ""Gee, it would be nice to watch a few episodes of Atlantis""...
Stargate:Atlantis is not the best show on TV, that belongs to Battlestar Galatica, but its still great scifi, and entertaining as well.

2273972,2,B000980GR0,"the show is starting to look a little better. But there is no teal""c on this show. This kind of makes it sort of boring. I love stargate sg-1,but i cannot get into this show. Maybe it will get better as it goes along.",1129507200,8,217,3.9545454545454546
2273973,5,B000980GR0,"After having discovered that an ancient race of advanced humans are the builders not only of the Stargate Network on the Milky Galaxy but also of the city of Atlantis, a team of international experts embarks a one way journey to the Pegasus Galaxy (without the possibility to return home until they find an energy source) where the Ancient City is submerged under the water.

Stranded in an unknown galaxy and without enough power to restore Atlantis to its full glory, the new team must face a new powerful enemy called the Wraith (who managed to defeat the ancients not because of superior technology, but due to superior numbers and unending persistence), who are vampire like bug humanoids that practically drain life from their victims.

As the series unfolds, the team is in a desperate quest to find as much as they can about the city, the ancients, a power source to feed Atlantis called ZPM (three of these zero-point-modules are needed and they have none) and above all, to protect not only Atlantis from an imminent siege from the Wraith, but also to prevent them from ever finding Earth's location (or they will ""feast"" of all human life in the Milky Way galaxy).

The story develops nicely, and the mythology of the series grows this season each episode, building the hype for the second season with a cliffhanger.

Some prefer Stargate SG-1 over Atlantis, but considering that SG-1 has had 8 years to evolve into what it has become, Atlantis is getting there quite fast. The concept of exploring the city of the ancients in a new galaxy has tremendous potential, more enemies besides the Wraith are introduced (Genni) or hinted (the ones who created the devastating virus of the episode Hot Zone are promising).

Overall, this is the start of another great series. Highly recommended.",1129334400,,1798,4.843648208469055
2273974,5,B000980GR0,"I have been watching science fiction since 1961. I have seen many different types of the genre. This show is amazing. It has characters you can really get into, story lines which are truly excellent and Atlantis (the city) is a special feast in itself). I nearly didn't watch this because I had seen so many damn shows about Atlantis but I was captured by the huge storyline this show presents. If you have not seen this first season yet this is an excellent chance to see it and want to see the second season which has been even better then the first.

Don't look to see Stargate SG-1 because even thought the two shows are related. Stargate: Atlantis is a series in and of its own. Think big in this series and watch for some really awesome scenes. Even my Mom who is not a sci-fi person loves this series.",1128816000,7,808,4.3509933774834435
2273975,2,B000980GR0,"Stargate Atlantis is quite possibly the worst spin off I have had the displeasure of watching. I'm giving it 2 stars only for the music and special effects.  It is a poor attempt at taking a wonderful story and turning it into a complete failure. Dr. Rodney McKay comes off as the same annoying; know it all, blowhard that he played on a couple episodes of the original SG-1. He is a pale attempt at giving Atlantis it's own version of Samantha Carter.  Dr. Elizabeth Weir is a failure as a leader with a sweet smile and clueless actions on how to deal with a military situation. Major John Sheppard seems totally out of place in this show. The wild haired Major comes off more as someone who wants to look good rather than someone who has any idea about the military. Rounding out the foursome is Lt. Aiden Ford. This character seems more like a high school freshman trying to fit it than an SG member. I will give credit in regards to the basic plot and the special effects. You can see the same desire put in each episode as have been with SG-1, but it lacks the solid acting and creative characters that SG-1 fans have come to enjoy. I was also pleased with the creation of a new enemy. The wraiths are a welcome change from the Goa'uld and I feel there is great potential with them. Overall this show has come to be a great disappointment to me. It has the look and feel of SG-1, but none of the depth from a character perspective. Watch at your own risk.",1128470400,24,1460,4.305454545454546

Despite the negative veiws posted below (I don't know what ""Karen"" was watching but it sure wasn't Stargate Atlantis) I really enjoyed this show. Yes, its not like stargate but if you want Stargate then watch Stargate. I don't know what exactly they mean by the charectors not developing fast. So what if they aren't all peas in a pod like Sg-1! Not every show is like that. I, for one love how the team interacts with each other. I can't wait for this show to come out on DVD. 5 stars at least!!",1128384000,7,540,4.303921568627451
2273977,5,B000980GR0,"Yes this show isn't SG-1 and sadly some people can't seem to get pass that. The show is different enough from Sg-1 that it can hold its own and not be considered a rip-off or a clone yet retain the same Stargate feel that SG-1 has. This show is actually what rekindled my interest in the Stargate franchise, you've got characters that actually aren't perfect, that make mistakes and are easy to relate to. There mostly ordinary people in an extraordinary situation where they slowly come togethor and become a family of sorts. The strength of this show is the character development, which actually is even more noticeable in the second season but the first season does a pretty good job. Probably the best episodes story wise are Before I Sleep and Letter from Pegasus which are perhaps the best clip show episodes ive seen in the Stargate franchise.

If you can accept that this show isn't actually SG-1 and really we don't need two Sg-1's bcse we already have one, try this show out, you might enjoy it. The show has fun,attractive and real characters that actually grow and change and there is reasonable continuity theoughout the season which is important to you if you don't like shows that you leave you guessing for a long time.",1128297600,62,1235,4.665137614678899
2273978,5,B000980GR0,"Stargate Atlantis is a breath of fresh air for the stargate franchise, which, for me jumped the shark with the removal of Daniel Jackson and never got back on it.

Atlantis is brilliant well scripted and acted and incredibly funny at times with the best sci-fi villains ever and the coolest cast.

Moving the program away from earth and into the pegasus galaxy was a brilliant idea allowing the program to develop its own identity away from earth whilst retaining the integrity of the Stargate universe.

Well worth a watch and am waiting eagerly for season 2 to air in England.

2273979,4,B000980GR0,"I was so paranoid that the producers of Atlantis were going to make a huge mistake, and that the series would be canceled after only a few episodes. I was pleasantly surprised.

The SG-1 team discovered the city of the Ancients, Atlantis, and sent an exploratory team. They ended up getting trapped there, with no way home...at first.

The series has its nemesis, the Wraith, a race of beings that were accidentally created by the Ancients experimenting on a large insect that drained life energy from its host. Thus, they created a humanoid race that preyed upon them, eventually driving them out of the galaxy.

This is a great start to the series. Character development has been slow in places, but even the great SG-1 had some slow spots, although season 1 for SG-1 was filled with it. In Atlantis, they have spent lots of time fleshing out the enemy, so that we don't keep thinking that the Goa'uld are going to show up at some point as the evil forces bent on their destruction.

I hope this is the first of many seasons, and if you're a fan of SG-1, it won't take much to cross you over to Atlantis.",1127606400,6,1106,4.487562189054726
