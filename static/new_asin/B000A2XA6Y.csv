2354698,4,B000A2XA6Y,"i have to be fair this is really a fun movie to me. it's cheesey, and just bad, but i think it's the funniest movie i have seen in a while. martin landau still years away from oscar gold in ""ed wood"" must have really needed a job to even be seen in this one, and i'm sure he really loves the fact that thanks to dvd we can see the movie in all it's cleaned up widescreen glory.

  oh kay here we go , the town of pottisville, idaho has been having some problems of late. it seems like after the toxic nuclear waste dump came to town strange things have been happening like, people go missing, it rains a lot, thunders a lot, a women runs around in her robe calling for ""mike"" or something like that,ruth buzzi becomes the mayors wife, a porn shop maybe opening up on main street, kenny rogers wife works at a dinner, the cheif of police is so bad an actor that they have to have james keach the brother of stacy, husband of ""dr. quinn"", and producer of ""walk the line"" dub his lines, and, well you get the idea, things are bad.

  WOW, now you know as much as i did when i saw it we think, but don't know, that mike or what ever his name is, is now our monster, maybe.?? really thats about it but for some reason i find this movie so very funny that i'm laughing as i type this review. nothing about this film is good, but it is funny because of that. everyone acts like they think this might really be good.

  well you have been warned, but if you give it a chance, in the right frame of mind this is a very funny horror movie, just have fun with it.",1142380800,4,1552,3.9967637540453076
2354699,1,B000A2XA6Y,"any movie that starts in the middle can't be oscar worthery the lead actor's voice is dubed by James Keach (not sure if spelling is right), brother of Stachy Keach (see above),husband of ""Dr. Quinn"", and producer of ""Walk the Line"". I did enjoy ruth buzzi's death scene tho!!! Still i did find it very funny and great for a bad movie night with friends!!! (talk back to the screen as much as you like)",1133740800,,401,4.36
2354700,3,B000A2XA6Y,"The first thing I noticed as the opening credits rolled for The Being (1983) were the names Martin Landau (Ed Wood), Jos Ferrer (Cyrano de Bergerac), and Dorothy Malone (Written on the Wind) and I thought to myself, ""Wow, three Oscar winning actors appearing in the same film?  I certainly can't go wrong here, right?""...and then I got a look at the rest of the cast...Rexx Coltrane aka Bill Osco (Night Patrol, The Underachievers), former Mrs. Kenny Rogers Marianne Gordon (The Legend of Blood Mountain), Murray `The Unknown Comic' Langston (Skatetown, U.S.A., Night Patrol), Ruth Buzzi (""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In"", Skatetown, U.S.A.), Kent Perkins (Night Patrol, Breeders), and Kinky Friedman, whose song ""Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed"" earned him the title of `Male Chauvinist Pig of the Year' in 1974, from the group NOW...this doesn't look good...oh, and look, Jackie Kong (Night Patrol, The Underachievers, Blood Diner) is credited as not only the director, but also the writer.  I guess it helps to get gigs like this when the producer is your husband and star (Rexx Coltrane aka Bill Osco), and also a member of the family that owns the national chain of Osco Drug stores (cha-ching!).

As the movie begins we find ourselves in the sleepy town of Pottsville, Idaho, better known as Spudtown U.S.A.  A voice over comes up and tells us there's been a series strange and unexplained events recently, right around the time the gooberment started dumping toxic waste just outside of town...hmmm, I'd think if your town's primary industry was centered around growing things, the last thing you'd want is a toxic waste dump in the area, but then again, if movies have taught me anything, it's that radioactive material has the effect of `embiggening' things, so maybe it's for the best.  Anyway, now we're at the toxic dump, and we see a kid running for his life.  He jumps into a car and speeds away, but wait, there's something on the car...claws tear through the roof, pop goes the weasel (by weasel I mean his head), and the car crashes.  Police arrive on the scene, including Detective Morty Lutz (Coltrane), but guess what?  There's no body, no head, only a lot of green goo.  Next we see someone named Garson Jones (Landau) on the television, a gooberment chemist and proponent of toxic waste, claiming there are no environmental hazards involved with the dumping of radioactive materials nearby (I'm betting that will come back to bite him in the behind later).  There's some antics at the drive-in, some more missing people, a bizarre and pointless dream sequence, Lutz hits on waitress named Laurie (Gordon) at the local diner, along with sharing his concerns about recent events with Mayor Lane (Ferrer), who happens to think Lutz is a nut and fears how all this crazy talk will affect the sales of potatoes.  After a series of more seemingly meaningless events, Jones and Lutz eventually make a stand against the monster (or monsters) in a local chemical warehouse.

All in all The Being is a pretty rotten film, borrowed heavily from others movies (Alien, for one), but it did have some bright spots.  My favorite sequence was the Easter Sunday egg hunt.  Colored eggs were hidden around the outside of the local church for the children to find, and a special prize was offered the child who found the large egg with a picture of the Easter Bunny.  As the children scurried about, a little toddler walks off, comes across a suspicious hole containing one of the creatures (nothing happens), along with finding the large egg.  The Mayor's wife finds the wee girl, and makes the announcement that the prize egg has been found, to which you hear one of the young boys off screen disappointedly remark ""Ohhh Sh#t"".  I dunno why, but this really made me laugh.  The good news is Buzzi's character gets it later on in story, the bad news is her much warranted death by grievous mutilation isn't shown.  We don't see much of the creature throughout the film (it loved hiding in backseats and trunks of cars for some reason), until the very end when its displayed more prominently, looking much like a ten pounds of bloody meat with dripping, razor teeth, one wiggling eyeball, and a twenty foot long grasping tongue stuffed into a five pound garbage bag.  Another really funny sequence was near the end as Landau's character is attacked by the creature, the effect involving a crewmember off screen tossing a rubber replica onto Landau, Landau catching it, and then rolling around on the floor pretending to wrestle it...oh bruther...one thing that really annoyed me was about this film was choppy pacing, stemming from series of relatively random occurrences, strung together by a threadbare story.  This was the same, exact formula used in Kong's next film, Night Patrol (1984), and it worked okay there as that was a silly comedy, but here it failed miserably as it never provided any real basis for events or the characters so they all came off as two dimensional constructs.  The scripting is pretty lousy, there's an overabundance of pointless characters (Dorothy Malone's, in particular), and generally poor acting.  Coltrane should not have been the star, as he had not the skills to carry the film (in my opinion), but, I guess when you're the producer, you can do whatever the hell you want...as I mentioned earlier, this film borrowed heavily from other films, particularly Alien (1979).  The creature, along with various aspects of the story, seemed somewhat fashioned after the one in that film (bulbous head, razor teeth dripping with saliva, prehensile tongue, giant claws, gooey slime, chest burst sequence, a cat, etc.), only here they obviously had a lot less money for effects.  Given this was a low budget, independent feature I wouldn't have minded the shoddy, derivative effects at all had the story been stronger and more focused.  You could pour all the money in the world into a film and it will still come off like swill without a strong backbone, a prime example of this being just about any of Roland Emmerich's movies (I did like Stargate, though).  This is a two star movie, but I'm going to give it three because I always get a kick out of seeing Martin Landau...he didn't do himself any favors appearing in this film, but he did make me smile, especially when he was trying to convince residents how there was more danger in their kitchen appliances than in toxic waste.

Media Blasters/Shriek Show provides a decent anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1) picture on this DVD, one that does exhibit flaws throughout.  The print used doesn't seem to have aged all that well, but it is relatively clean.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 audio does come through clear enough.  In terms of extras, there's a promotional trailer for the movie, along with production stills, and trailers for other DVD releases like Anthropophagus (2002), Just Before Dawn (1981), and Devil Dog (1978).  There are also previews for Fangoria International DVD releases including Rojo Sangre (2004), Plaga Zombie Zona Mutante (2001), Choking Hazard (2004), and Hiruko (1990).  I may not have enjoyed this film as much as I would have liked, but I do appreciate this smaller companies releasing material onto DVD that would otherwise be lost.

2354701,4,B000A2XA6Y,"this movie started okay, but tends to drag through the middle then picked up towards the end. this movie was good but the media blasters dvd seemed a bit rushed the picture was a bit grainy and dark.the sound was okay it could have used 5.1 or at least stereo mix. the movie f/x were alright however the creature at some points in the film looked like a sleeping bag, but what do you expect it was on a low budget. (at least as  far as the creature was concern.) as far as low budget toxic monster movies go this one was really enjoyable.",1127174400,3,538,4.173076923076923
2354702,3,B000A2XA6Y,"This, believe it or not, is one of the very earliest exposures I had to horror movies. It's not a big budget blockbuster, nor is it the type of movie that tries to be anything more than what it is. ""The Being,"" simply put, is an old school 1950's style creature feature made with early 1980's sensibilities. Want some decapitations and an assorted array of dismembered body parts? Wanna' see a gaggle of washed up actors chew some scenery? Well settle in, buckaroos, because you'll find all that and more in this groovy little production!

We start things off in the sleepy town of Pottsville, Idaho. A gruesomely evil creature with lots of sharp teeth is lurking around the town's disposal dump, driven mad by toxic waste, and picking off wary residents left and right. The mayor turns a blind eye to all this, and it soon falls upon the dynamic duo of Sheriff Rexx Coltrane, and resident scientist, the legendary Martin Landau, to kill the nasty critter.

I have waited years for this nifty little gem to hit DVD. It's a guilty pleasure for me, if nothing else. And, if you're not all that demanding, you may find something to enjoy with it too. Of course, it helps matters more if you happen to savor affectionately made B-movies like this. So, be forewarned. ""Gone With The Wind"" this ain't.

2354728,2,B000A2XA6Y,"Idaho. ""The Gem State."" Major exports: Potatoes, lumber, and TERROR! The radioactive waste that is being dumped into the town's water supply has taken form as The Being, a mutant monster with a taste for blood that is killing off the locals. Detective Mortimer Lutz is the town's last defense against the evil menace, but local politics prevent him from contacting the National Guard. Why? Potatoes. Mayor Lane won't let anything stand in the way of Pottsville's lucrative potato business... Not radiation, not untimely death... Nothing! Jackie Kong's feature film debut is a bloody mess that only gets by thanks to its absurd plot and gallons of gore. Jose Ferrer and Martin Landau are wasted on this pathetic B-movie, but the poor writing in the script allows for several unintentional moments of hilarity from each of them. Landau's role as the environmental chemist is to prove that dumping toxic waste into the town's drinking water will have no adverse effects. Really? Where do you even start dissecting that? In all of Idaho, there is no place else to dump toxic waste but in the water supply? Who does Mayor Lane think is going to pick the potatoes, the mutants? Where does Idaho even get toxic waste to begin with? Thankfully, The Being comes along and rips off a few heads, tears out people's hearts, and slimes everything in sight. As far as terrible B-movies go, THE BEING rates at the top of the charts, but it is enjoyably bad from start to finish.

2354730,3,B000A2XA6Y,"I got this movie for one reason and one reason alone, Martin Landau! I'm a huge fan and loved him in Space:1999, Mission:Impossible etc... so I purchased ""The Being"". Warning to all: this movie is so bad that its Hilarious! Obviously filmed during the time after Landau starred in ""Space"" and before ""Tucker"" and must have REALLY needed the money because this movie is pure crap. BUT, if you love laughing at classic ""B-movie"" fodder then you'll love this movie. Here are some examples of what I mean from the movie:
1. Random person running from something (in daylight)cut to them in a junk yard (now suddenly night time) getting into a random car and starting it up (keys in car and it still runs even though its in a junk yard) then drives off. Suddenly ""the Being"" is on the roof of car, punches its hand through the roof of car and tears drivers head off, car crashes. Cut to cops talking about incident as car gets towed off there's (No hole in the ceiling) of said car?
2. Main star of movie (terrible actor playing cop) goes home and pulls covers off his bed to find (green Jello) under covers. Being comes out from under bed to get guy. Guy runs outside (night time) and runs for the train tracks hoping to elude ""the Being"" crosses train tracks and train speeds by. Cut to guy on the ground (now suddenly day time) as he looks down the street to nothing there. Apparently ""the Being"" is afraid of trains.
3. Martin Landau on some news program trying to sell the fact that pouring ""Nuclear Waste"" into the drinking water will ""NOT"" contaminate it.....really!?!
4. Ruth Buzzi's death scene (reason alone for watching movie). Let me just say, the woman has some MOUTH on her...
5. Terrible actor Cop and Kenny Rogers ex-wife walking down the street. He opens door of car for her to get into and movie crew throws (big plastic monster suit) at them which goes right into car. Cop closes car door and they run off.
6. Martin Landau gets (big plastic monster suit) thrown on him as he screams ""God this script is terrible! Please just pay me now so I can leave, or just shoot me."" Just kidding about what he said, but they did throw a big plastic monster suit on him.
  I could go on and on but I'm telling you, if your in for a good laugh then get this movie. If your in the mood to get scared then keep on moving cause its not going to happen with ""the Being"".",1318982400,,2366,4.36281179138322
2354731,4,B000A2XA6Y,"The movie opens up with an unnecessary radio broadcast and monologue to explain the film. A boy, fleeing from the creature and driving a car is killed by ""The Being."" This isn't just any killing. The Being enters the car by tearing a hole in the roof. He rips the kid's head off. After the head is gone, the boy is still struggling against the monster. Afterwards as they tow the car away, there is no hole in the roof.

The sheriff runs away from the Being, and it is pitch black outside. He crosses some RR tracks to elude the creature, then suddenly the sun is up.

Ruth Buzzi plays ""the church lady"" who runs an anti-pornography campaign to keep smut out of Pottsville, Idaho a community overrun with radioactive contamination and a killer mutant.  And yes the movie has ""the"" Dorothy Malone.

Martin Landau plays a scientist who supports dumping of nuclear waste into the drinking water. The movie has no idea of 10CFR20 limitations on dumping as Landau throws around terms which he is clueless as to what they mean. 96 rads is somehow equated to ""over 900 millirads."" Actually 96 Rads is 96,000 millirads.

There are horror movies for most calendar events, Christmas, Valentine's Day, summer vacation, New Year's Eve, Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc. This is the only non-religious horror movie I can think of that centers around Easter, so don't forget to include this one with your Easter theme movies. ""We can fix that quicker than God makes poor folks,"" was one corny line used in the story. The sole Mexican (uncredited)in the film was called, ""Taco"" and was generally hounded by the police.

Token drive-in nudity, brief drive-in sex, drug use, ridiculous amounts of blood, no f-bombs.  Should be a cult classic on the order of ""Basket Case."" Yes, 4 stars

2354732,5,B000A2XA6Y,"One the best low-budget horror film. Effects are not bad for its time. Directed by the great Jackie Kong, the guy who gave us Blood Diner.",1205798400,,138,4.346153846153846
2354733,1,B000A2XA6Y,"When it comes to cult movies you'll be hard pressed to find a bigger fan than me. While I do enjoy mainstream movies ever since I was a child I always favored cult flicks. What most seem to write off as trash I see the greatness in. But The Being was pretty much for me a complete waste of time. I do understand the appeal; again being a fan of cult cinema I normally like these movies, but The Being was just flat out bad.

I wasn't expecting a brilliant masterpiece; I was expecting a cheesy low budget horror flick that could be classified as the so bad it's good. But instead I simply got a so bad its bad movie. The gore level was actually kind of low. The first murder scene had decent blood flow, but nothing great. Than later a cop gets punched through the back. Not as cool as it sounds believe it or not. Most of the kill scenes are off camera and that is a major letdown. All I wanted was a gory good time, but got a gore-less bad time.

The Being marked the feature film debut by writer/director Jackie Kong and its quite amazing she managed to get anymore work after this. This was her debut, but it was a terrible one. As a filmmaker I hate to trash other filmmakers. It's really not an easy job, but this movie was just an all out hack job. The script was terrible; nothing the characters say is very interesting, which I sort of expected. It was just bad writing and not in an entertaining way. As a director Kong, is even worse. There is no sense of pacing or anything.

The Being was produced and starred Bill Osco who used the name Rexx Coltrane. He also happens to be married to Jackie Kong. Osco had previously been involved in the porn industry and quite honestly maybe he should have stayed there. The one really odd thing is his voice for whatever reason was dubbed and it was dubbed by Stacey Keach. Stacey Keach is actually a very good actor, though he's done his fair share of lousy movies. Keach probably needed the money. He just says the dialogue. There is no emotion at all put into any of the lines.

The Being does have some once popular actors and best known among the bunch are Dorothy Malone, Jose Ferrer and none other than Martin Landau. All must have been rather desperate for work to appear in this movie. I'm willing to bet Landau never mentions this movie.

For me, The Being was pretty much a total waste, the 2nd half of the movie has some fairly decent moments. And what I mean by that is they are so bad they actually sort of work. But really with the exception of a scene or two everything is just bad. By the end I was barley paying attention. The gore level is low, most of the kills off camera and not even entreatingly bad. I can't say I recommend this, but while I hated the movie I do get the appeal it has. Watch at your own risk.",1196812800,,2784,4.215759849906191
2354734,5,B000A2XA6Y,"The Being is not a great movie. It's not even a really good movie. But as an absolutely enjoyable, laugh-aloud funny, cheesy B-level horror movie, this is possibly unbeatable!! Martin Landau is at his scenery-chewing best and gets to explain to viewers (as a government-hired expert on such things) how dumping radioactive waste into the local town water supply has no harmful effects (!!!) There are scenes which need to be watched repeatedly to get the full value of the humour out of them. If you enjoy other such movies in the B-grade (or Z-grade) horror category, and enjoy a laugh, then this is Very Highly Recommended!!

8073527,3,B000A2XA6Y,"This monster movie is nothing special at all outside of providing a less mainstream B-movie to entertain horror fans.  The effects are more entertaining than good, but unlike the acting and writing, the effects clearly put forth a solid effort.

Written and directed by first-time filmmaker Jackie Kong (Blood Diner), this film opens uninventively with a narration of the most basic expositionlocals are missing, strange things are happening, and the ultimate terror has taken form right there in Pottsville, Idaho.  We are told these three things.

The creature effects swing into action early, which is always a good thing when dealing with B-movies since the creature effects are really the only reason were hereand I can gladly say the effects are satisfying even if truly nothing special.  They include gross slimy monster limbs, gory on-screen decapitation, an out-of-focus monster attacking an in-focus naked woman, the old ripping the heart out of the chest gag, a prehensile frog-like tongue, and loads of green slime and gelatinous sludge.

Propagandist scientist Dr. Garson Jones (Martin Landau; Without Warning, Ed Wood) addresses the public regarding the safety of dumping nuclear waste into drinking water sources.  Because whats a little toxic waste?  I guess this movie is telling us!

At first things don't totally make sense.  For example, during a gratuitous sex scene in a car green sludge oozes through the AC vents and radio as our Casanova rounds third base.  Then, all of a sudden, a skeletal slimy sludge hand reaches up and attacks the young loversso the thing must have formed right there in the car!  But waitdid the monster liquefy then reform?  We never find out!  Speaking of slimy monster arms, that is all we see until we find a slimy mutant monster fetus and a throwback creature to the Husky lump in The Thing (1981).

When our protagonist meets our monster and tries to warn Mayor Gordon (Jos&eacute; Ferrer; Dune, The Sentinel, The Swarm), he could care less.  His only concern is the towns revenue stream of potato exports.  The mayor actually hires Dr. Jones to look into things and keep the situation quiet.

This all highlights some of the dumber aspects of the movie, among some other probably unintentionally silly scenes poorly held together by wooden acting and some incredibly lazy dialogue.  These actors couldn't be troubled to care about delivering a single line.  But hey, its a fun B-movie.  What did you expect, right?  I mean, whenever the monster leaps towards someone, it seems a production assistant just throws a monster dummy across the camera and onto the victim.  Theres even a low-speed chase scene and a needless car explosion.

Its not until the finale that we get to see something awesome.  The somehwat full-body creature is a sloppy, gory mess of teeth.  We actually just see its head and an arm.  But the head is pretty cool. Not creative at all, but fun to watch.

And thats what this movie is.  Its fun to watch and nothing else.  Theres nothing to brag in terms of interesting effects or story and the death scenes are uninspired.  But this bad movie is a good bad (i.e., so bad its good).  The fight between our hero and the toxic mutant is about as bad as it getsand I giggled throughout.
