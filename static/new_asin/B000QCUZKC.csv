Sus diez o ms premios por esta hazaa son muy bien merecidos. Esta pelcula sera un recurso excelente para cualquier nivel educativo. Yo soy maestra, y varias de mis estudiantes mexicanas lloraron al mirar lo bonito y lo valoroso de Mxico.
Mi nica observacin sera que mis estudiantes que no conocen esta costumbre no entendieron bien cmo o quin paga por este evento tan extravagante. Pero para ser una primera pelcula, es simplemente fabulosa. Seguramente tenemos que anticipar entusiasmadamente las prximas pelculas del Sr. Taub.

Translation:

This documentary is wonderful in many respects. It opens an authentic and beautiful window into the preparation for a quinceaera (mexican Sweet Fifteen birthday celebration/ceremony/rite of passage for girls) in Tijuana, Mexico. Ana Maria is the youngest of five girls who has prepared for this event. She gets a lot of advice and support from her family. Her family consists of her five sisters, her brother (the eldest), and her mother, Lili. Lili has endured and overcome a lot in her life: mainly the infidelities and subsequent abandonment on the part of her husband, and her struggle with her health; not to mention the economic challenge of being in her situation. The movie paints an excellent portrait of the dignity and nobility of this humble family . It also paints a true picture of the many ways that a young woman needs to prepare for this celebration; including the rehearsals with her 'chambelanes' (the young men who 'escort' her into her first waltz and present her to society - on their shoulders) and the classes that she attends at the church every Saturday. Adam Taub, the director handles the camera expertly. One does not detect his presence at all. One only sees the beauty and challenges of a Mexican town and family. He uses angles, light and color beautifully. Another marvel about this movie is that this is one of his first efforts. It was a student project for a university class. His ten or more prizes are well-deserved. This movie would be an excellent resource for any educational level, and it is also just about exactly a class period long (40 minutes). I am a teacher, and several of my mexican students cried from the nostalgia of seeing the beauty and worth of Mexico depicted here. My only observation would be that the students I have who are not familiar with this custom did not learn how a humble family like this could be paying for such an extravagant event. But for being his first movie, this is simply marvelous. We can only enthusiastically anticipate Mr. Taub's next movies!",1209945600,7,3735,4.780185758513932

2835270,5,B000QCUZKC,I was taking a chance on buying this without seeing it but I needed a DVD to show after I taught my Spanish 1 class about the ceremony of the Quinceanera. I was very pleased with this. It shows how a family in Mexico comes together to give the last of a mother's 5 daughters a beautiful ceremony for her 15th. The video is all in Spanish with subtitles. It is a real family. It shows the mother's emotions and struggles as she explains her coping with an unfaithful husband and also how the daughter reacts to his coming to the ceremony. My students really liked it too.,1207353600,13,570,4.287037037037037
2835271,5,B000QCUZKC,"I saw this documentary in a Film Fest in Texas. Being a Mexican myself, I was blown away by the truthful depiction of our culture, our country and the Quinceaera tradition achieved by this young filmmaker.

La Quinceaera follows a single mother and her family (mostly comprised of girls) as they prepare the Quinceaera celebration for the youngest daughter. In a mix of observational cinema and direct address interviews, the director, A. Taub, explores the meaning of womanhood in Hispanic culture and the struggles of a single mother raising her family in Tijuana.

The most enjoyable aspect of this documentary is how intimate the characters come across the film. Taub gained incredible access to this family and through the screen is evident the great level of trust between him and the family. As a result the documentary feels honest all throughout.

La Quinceaera is a fresh and genuine documentary. And above all, it is a a lovable tale of perseverance, motherhood and family unity through the good and the bad times.",1205539200,2,1025,4.982456140350878

Ana Maria kept all nine ""kids"" smiling, concentrating and commenting enthusiastically.  Ana Maria and her family touched the corners and the centers of so many of their stories.  What a simply, effectively, wonderfully crafted documentary!",1204416000,2,440,5.257142857142857
8195625,4,B000QCUZKC,Kept attention of most of my Spanish 1 ninth graders  (urban district). Mostly because they connected with the family issues. If this would've been purely culture-based it wouldn't have held their attention. I thought it was worth it.,1445385600,,234,5.157894736842105
8195626,3,B000QCUZKC,"It was average.  I showed it to my students and I could told they found it ho-hum.  I stopped it and talked about the homes, the clothing, etc. so it was a good teaching tool.",1443484800,,175,3.9714285714285715
8195627,3,B000QCUZKC,Good but a bit slow. Will see what my students think.,1433635200,,53,3.909090909090909

8195629,5,B000QCUZKC,"Good documentary, not heavy on the symbolism or history of the celebration, rather a snapshot of one family's celebration in a rural area of Mexico. Good companion to a unit. Teachers watch out for a scene where the sister is toasted with alcohol by her older brother and sisters! I show it every year, I just skip over that part.",1420070400,,330,4.516666666666667
8195630,2,B000QCUZKC,"This film, while creatively staged to represent the reality of the culture and how important the Quinceanera is to the moral and social development of a young Mexican woman, the overall quality of the film was poor and really not what I expected at all.",1418428800,,253,4.644444444444445
8195631,2,B000QCUZKC,I wanted a real cultural film about the history and customs of the quinceera.  A major portion of this film is about the marital and family problems in the family presented.  This is just not middle or high school material as there is too much on family problems and too little on the cultural aspect.,1400716800,,301,4.454545454545454
8195632,5,B000QCUZKC,"""La Quinceaera"" pone los sentimientos a flor de piel, es el vivo retrato de la devocin de la familia mexicana!

Este excelente documental del Sr. Taub, ""La Quinceaera"" logra capturar de una manera sensible y cautivadora, los preparativos para la fiesta de 15 aos de Ana Mara, la menor de 5 hermanos de una familia mexicana en una pequea comunidad de Tijuana en el 2003.

A pesar de los retos financieros, retos de salud y la falta del apoyo del padre, Lili, la madre de Ana Mara, nunca pierde la esperanza ni el sentido de los valores familiares, culturales y religiosos con los que ha educado a sus hijos, y est dispuesta a luchar por hacer realidad el sueo de Ana Mara: ser ""La Quinceaera"" y tener un da maravilloso.

El trabajo de Adam Taub es admirable! Logr establecer una relacin de confianza inigualable con la familia de Ana Mara, lo que le permiti capturar de una manera tan objetiva y sutil el significado de esta tradicin mexicana.

""La Quinceera"" es material valioso para bibliotecas, escuelas y otras instituciones que abren las puertas al multiculturalismo.

Bravo Sr. Taub",1365033600,2,1087,4.76063829787234
8195633,5,B000QCUZKC,"Wow!  This DVD gives a fantastic, realistic, and modern look into the world of the Quinces.  I've been looking for something to show my Spanish classes, that wasn't ""glamorized"" or from the 80's.  A word of caution to all teachers who plan to show this video to their classes, there are a couple of scenes that need to be addressed/discussed, (1) when the mother discusses her husband's infidelities, (2) when tequila is added to everyone's drinks in celebration of the event that's about to take place, (3) at the party, they show the kids toasting with beer.  Though these rituals may be culturally acceptable and appropriate in some parts of the world, U.S. kids will need to hear clarifications, especially at the middle school level!
Nontheless, I would strongly recommend this video!  Well done!",1254700800,6,801,4.947761194029851
8195634,5,B000QCUZKC,"The quality of photography of this documentary is surprisingly great. Adam Taub captures the little details of living in a poor town in Mexico. The dreams of a little girl and her preparation to becoming a woman; physically, mentally, and emotionally.

Quinceanera has to learn and realize that life is not always how we picture it.
Her mother never loses sight of what is important for her and her family despite the unexpected turn of events.

Great documentary that really makes you feel you are there as part of this event and the family emotional iterations.",1217289600,2,563,4.854166666666667
