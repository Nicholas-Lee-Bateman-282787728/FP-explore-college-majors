915470,5,6304622783,This was a gag gift for my son who starred in the movie.,1411948800,,56,3.3846153846153846
915471,1,6304622783,"I had gotten this at Movie Exchange just a week before thanksgiving. I saw this along with another movie, Hyperspace. I paid only $1.70 for both films....and in terms of Cybernator, I still think I paid WAY too much for this travesty. It's horrible, boring, and completely stupid and unoriginal.

Cybernator takes place in the year 2010, where the Earth has become a world where the economy has collapsed, the government has fallen, and all power has fallen under military control as military trained cyborg assassins have turned against them. It all starts off with a Crooked Senator and his hooker girlfriend entering a hotel room. They're about to start knockin' boots when the hooker is killed by cyborgs and the senator gets a similar fate. Then cut to some strip club where dumb music is playing and then it starts to focus on our main character, L.A. Police Officer Brent McCord (Whom like one reviewer said, looks like Corey Feldman crossed with John Stamos) and his partner, Jim Weaver (Our token black guy.) Unfortunately, Jim gets killed in the middle of the movie which leaves Brent to work things out himself. Brent later discovers something about his past, along with his girlfriend, who doesn't really look that pretty. The cyborgs are lead by Colonel Peck, played by William Smith from Maniac Cop, who can't even save this movie from being so awful.

Overall, the movie just plain sucks. On November 20, 2008, this film gained itself a #2 spot on my worst movies list (The first of course, being Howling II, the third being Brave Frog.) If anything the C.I.A. should use this sewage leak of a film on terrorists.

Avoid this ""movie"" at all costs.",1228953600,4,1662,4.7839721254355405
915472,1,6304622783,"I actually like B movies, but the problem is, this one is so horrible, it makes me sick.  Usually B movies are entertaining in their own way, but this one just churns your stomach and makes your head hurt.  Bad acting, bad story, and it isn't even ""funny"" bad, like some B movies are.  Avoid at all cost.",1011830400,8,304,4.206896551724138
915473,1,6304622783,"Few things can be said about this movie. Let's put it this way. I haven't thrown up in a really long time. Probably since the age of 13, I'm 40 now. One night the wife and I decided we wanted a good sci-fi flick so we picked up Cybernator. The entire family is sitting in the living room watching this disgrace. My children were crying and I was violently wretching on my wife's face. Cybernator was so awful that if I got a water gun, painted my face white, and spoke like my baby daughter it would be more Science Fiction-y. This moive impacted my family very much. The morning after I awoke to realize that my wife and children had moved out. She left a note about how she could not love a man who introduced his family to Cybernator. She said that if one of the children dies that she would tell officers that they were murdered by me. The letter ended with her saying that after watching Cybernator I pretty much had already murdered my family. It's been tough lately. Since my divorce I walk the streets-face painted white, carrying a super soaker. I only respond if I am referred to as 'Cybernator.' I have acquired the ability to fly too! Thank you Robert Rundle...thank you for my hell that some might call life. Death to the Cybernator!",1007078400,57,1246,4.3982683982683985
915474,2,6304622783,"Pure comic genius. DVD was packed with terrible moments that strike fear into and shame into anyone who sat thru this movie. This movie gives hope to any up and coming film producers; anyone can make anything, and everyone will buy it.",997574400,2,235,4.619047619047619
915475,1,6304622783,"Robert Rundle is a genius.  How he conned anyone into giving him money to film this piece of ... is beyond me.  I do give credit to the emotion in this movie, namely it causing a sense of suicidal despair.  I would have ... ... ... away 80 minutes of my life than sit through this thing.  Oh no, I'm getting the headaches again.",997142400,7,328,4.078125
915546,1,6304622783,"well....one star for the effort. Acting was really bad - but the lead actress, well - the only thing going for the movie- but her part was mostly for show- and show she did, quite a bit...not really a logical part of the plot. The Army Guy needed a haircut and a press to his fatigues, the Cyborg guys died as easy as everyone else does...so what makes them so dangerous? So there are cyborgs running around and then there are secret cyborgs....didn't get that part of the movie, made no sense. The writing was really awful and editing was worse....but it did tell a story - Stay away from Cyborgs, especially in this movie.",1465776000,,624,4.434782608695652

915616,3,6304622783,"Another Lloyd Kaufman (Troma Team) video. Fun to watch. Mediocre acting. Dismal directing. Bad special effects. Or maybe just cheap. But, what a fun movie. Anything Kaufman or Troma always gets a 3 or 4 star rating. These people do not take them self's serious which makes their camp horror/comedy more fun.",1438473600,,307,4.923076923076923

7876238,2,6304622783,"Right from the opening credits, I said, no screamed, ""Oh yes! This must be seen!"". I mean, a bald guy w/ aquarium air-hoses coming out of his head! C'mon! This! will! Be! Art!! Once again, those naughty cyborgs are up to no good! After murdering a senator, these synthetic humanoids (think low-rent STAR TREK Borg mixed w/ pitifully-realized HELLRAISER demons) chuckle robotically. Next, we're off to an exclusive night spot (think Club Scum from HOBGOBLINS w/ cyborgs!), where the world's slipperiest woman dances the hootchie-coo. Here we meet LA police officer, Brent McCord (Lonnie Schuyler). He's in love w/ a stripper named Blue (Christina Peralta). Oh shucks! Eeeevil cyborgs have arrived (think Mr. and Mrs. TERMINATOR). just as MCcord proves his love for Blue, by giving her a dollar bill in his teeth! She's just working her way through school, don'tcha know! Poorly choreographed murder erupts, and another senator bites the dust. The dullness of the ensuing shootout is impossible to describe! Of course, there's a reason for the senator killings, having to do w/ a vast government conspiracy, but that's dull as well. Can MCcord and his equally feeble partner, Jim Weaver (Jeff Jenkins), stop tube-head and his clunky cohorts? By this point, It's doubtful that anyone cares! To be honest, I don't believe the makers of this ""film"" cared much either. William Smith (INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS) makes an appearance as a nefarious military type, adding nothing to the story. Lots of godawful ""acting"" and jaw-dropping-ly absurd dialogue, makes us wonder if the entire cast isn't comprised of artificial lifeforms! It also contains a botched, terribly shot, laughable love scene, that goes on forrrevvverrr! This is a rare hyper-schlock experience! Unfortunately, its languid presentation takes away from what could have been a masterwork of cinematic misery! Watch for the ""big twist"" that actually makes things less suspenseful! Do NOT miss the belly dancer scene! You will never hear finger-cymbals in quite the same way again! If you can stay awake long enough, you'll stagger into the hilarious, karate-filled non-finale. Have no fear, it will put you right into REM sleep! Watching CYBERNATOR is like all unnecessary suffering. It has no rhyme or reason to it, simply existing to cause great pain...  P.S.- Another tragic TROMA release...",1506729600,,2352,5.205804749340369
