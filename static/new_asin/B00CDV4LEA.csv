5716681,5,B00CDV4LEA,"If you like the older movies you'll enjoy this collection of 3 mystery movies.  It has the same quality as ""The Thin Man"" series with light hearted comedy mixed in with a mystery.  Well worth the money for 3 quality movies.",1375920000,21,223,4.414634146341464
5716682,5,B00CDV4LEA,"This movie is a clear winner.  It's too bad that more of this kind of show hasn't found it's way back into a genre where everything is real sans the need for computer enhanced goodies.  The actors truly deserved to be paid for the price of admission. Can't help but really like this program, and while one might suggest this is but another Nick 'n Nora knockoff, it wasn't, at least from my perch on the Central Oregon Coast.  Good actors, good writing, good plot, well, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and if it quacks like a duck, well, what do you think?  It must be one.",1372636800,28,585,4.196428571428571
5716693,3,B00CDV4LEA,"Fun movies to watch as long as you are not expecting anything exciting. Melvyn Douglas must have had to use all his ""acting chops"" to get through these movies.  I guess he was on the star list and the studios wanted to get movies out there as Douglas was a star and made money for the studios.",1409875200,,293,4.140350877192983
5716694,5,B00CDV4LEA,"These three movies are hilarious! Though three different guys play the same character, the main movie and two sequels, it still flows. Loved all three and best price around. Thanks!",1405382400,2,181,5.066666666666666
5716695,5,B00CDV4LEA,"While Franchot Tone never made it into the Big Leagues, as did Melvyn Douglas and Robert Montgomery, he still does a good job in the least adept of this mini-series (to use a term from the still-to-come television world) . In Douglas and Montgomery, however, we see the light touch that these first generation ""talkie"" actors could bring to a film, despite their ability to enrich the most serious of dramas. Enough of semi-serious discussion, these were made purely for fun; in that aim, the first two are quite successful, the third worth the time to see. It is good to have these back in circulation, with their mix of familiar 1930's character actors backing studio 'A' players. Why reviewers see a need to compare these with The Thin Man, aside from their being in the same sub-genre, I don't know. Before that classic film, the 'light comedy amateur detective' movie, was already well established, allowing the later actors, including Powell, to draw on their own as well as other's earlier works. In each of these, the part of the wife is subordinated to that of the husband, but is an essential element in the comedic success of  the film. In this case, the least well known at that time, Florence Rice (mated to Douglas) fulfills  her function admirably. None of these was unfamiliar to me but none disappointed in providing a most pleasant experience. The triple-header is to be highly recommended",1404086400,,1407,4.809917355371901
5716696,5,B00CDV4LEA,"Bright dialogue, charming characters, good mysteries.  I didn't realize I had never seen Fast Company before!  Actors in the studio system were always working, so you get top stars in little B movies.  These are comfortable and relaxing, can be enjoyed often.",1392681600,7,259,5.119047619047619
5716697,5,B00CDV4LEA,"All three of the movies in this collection are excellent.  The casting was very well done, since all the couples had a good rapport.  :)  If you are a fan of light-hearted mystery films, these would be a good choice.  My family and I really enjoyed the collection.",1386547200,6,264,4.4375
5716698,4,B00CDV4LEA,"I received this as a gift and thoroughly enjoyed these three films which were all in the vein of the classic Thin Man series. These whodunits may lack to some extent the panache of Nick and Nora Charles which was cultivated through the series, these as stand alone films do not fail to entertain as they reflect good screen pairings.
With the exception of Fast and Loose, I had not seen the other films. If you like slick detective films from the  '30's with decent production values, this set will not disappoint. They move quickly, are fun, and the casting works.",1384646400,6,565,4.594059405940594
5716699,4,B00CDV4LEA,"Not The Thin Man. But fun, querky. Odd that the actors playing the couple are different in each film.  For 1930s film buffs.",1384041600,6,124,4.391304347826087
5716700,5,B00CDV4LEA,"Three husband and wife mysteries in the vein of The Thin Man, each with different couples.  Light and sophisticated with top stars such as Melvyn Douglas, Rosalind Russell and Franchot Tone as the book dealer sleuths.",1381622400,3,217,5.027777777777778
5716701,5,B00CDV4LEA,"This DVD contains three movies with different actors playing the same characters. FAST COMPANY stars Melvyn Douglas and Florence Rice in a decent mystery with George Zucco as one of the bad guys. The rare book dealer world is the setting and makes for an interesting change. FAST AND LOOSE stars Robert Montgomery and Rosalind Russell and almost hits the gold  standard of the Thin Man mystery. Montgomery and Russell do a good job of the expected banter back and forth. A rare manuscript is missing and a mansion full of suspects are running around in the middle of the night. This is the best of the three from this mystery buff's point of view and the reason why I am keeping this dvd. FAST AND FURIOUS stars Franchot Tone and Ann Sothern and throws a young Mary Beth Hughes in as a bathing beauty. Yes, I did say bathing beauty - we have left the world of books for a beauty contest in 'Seaside City'. Busby Berkley directs - good heavens, how the mighty are fallen. This is one of those movies where people are dying but you just can't take any of it seriously. And I haven't even mentioned the lions. If you are fan of 30's mysteries, you will probably enjoy owning this set.",1378857600,16,1181,4.442396313364055
5716702,5,B00CDV4LEA,"I love the old mysteries. There just fun to watch....no bad language, nudity or blood and gore..Black and white films are such fun.",1376611200,8,131,4.739130434782608
8580564,5,B00CDV4LEA,"I really love old movies, especially mysteries or noir.  These movies do not seem as famous as some old movies - I had never heard of any of them til recently, when I ran across one on TCM.  All 3 feature the characters Joel & Garda Sloane, who sell the occasional rare book and indulge in amateur detecting on the side.  Those characters are played by different actors in all 3 movies.  Fast Company, 1938, with Melvyn Douglas and Florence Rice.  Fast and Furious, 1939, with Franchot Tone and Ann Sothern - definitely NOTHING to do with the current Vin Diesel bunch of films with that name!  And my personal favorite, Fast and Loose, 1939, with Rosalind Russell and Robert Montgomery.  All the movies are basically light-hearted, kind of silly mysteries.  They are definitely NOT noir.  Light comedy, fast faced, witty dialog.  If you like that sort of thing, you may enjoy one or all of these.",1526083200,,896,4.649681528662421
8580565,4,B00CDV4LEA,Great product!,1525392000,,14,6.5
8580566,4,B00CDV4LEA,"Deserving more attention. This fun series is THE THIN MAN redux, but a welcome addition to a classic mystery  or comedy collector's home.",1462320000,,137,4.956521739130435
8580567,3,B00CDV4LEA,"I wanted to ""love"" these old movies. But I discovered 3 pleasant but mostly dull characters and plots. Russell can usually be counted on for wonderful acting, but IMO, she was miscast in Fast and Loose. She was actually boring -- or maybe more aptly, ""sleepy."" The plots were thin, but I liked the booksellers ""mystery"" best of the lot. I consider this purchase a waste of money and will not be watching any of the 3 movies again. Sorry for being so frank....",1458777600,2,459,4.476190476190476
