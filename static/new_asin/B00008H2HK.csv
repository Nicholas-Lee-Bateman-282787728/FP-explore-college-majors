1847358,5,B00008H2HK,"This fabulous new release from the good folk at Something Weird Video presents three of the infamous ""Olga"" films, complete and uncut, with a few choice extras.
For maximum effect, you should watch the movies in chronological order, as follows...
WHITE SLAVES OF CHINATOWN - Meet Olga Petroff (Audrey Campbell). She is a hard-hearted woman with a penchant for torture and sin. Olga runs a prostitution ring, and also has shares in an opium sydicate. Watch as Olga 'disciplines' her girls in outlandish torture methods! Keep an eye out Gigi Darlene (BAD GIRLS GO TO HELL) who plays one of Olga's lovelies.
OLGA'S HOUSE OF SHAME - Olga relocates her business to an abandoned mill in upstate New York. Joining Olga is her corrupt brother Nick (W.B. Parker) and the lovely Elaine (Alice Davis, aka Alice Linville). When the beautiful Nadja (Ella Daphne) tries to destroy Olga's empire, there's hell to pay as Olga fights back with all her fury.
OLGA'S DANCE HALL GIRLS - Olga (now played by Lucy Eldredge) sets up 'housekeeping' in the suburbs, and recruits all the able-bodied housewives in the area for her new business, which is just a front for a weird satatnic cult, complete with Olga as the 'High Priestess'!. Featuring appearances by Larry Hunter, Hattie Felder and Moia Gifford.
The extra features include the short-subject ""Audrey Campbell: Art Lover"" which also features her husband, director Byron Mabe (THE HEAD MISTRESS). There's also the ""Olga"" exerpt from MONDO OSCENITA, trailers for the films featured on the disc and a tantalising exerpt from the 'lost' ""Olga"" film, MADAME  OLGA'S MASSAGE PARLOR (which starred W.B. Parker and Alice Linville reprising their roles of Nick and Elaine!).
With Synapse set to release the missing ""Olga"" film (OLGA'S GIRLS) complete with a commentary by no less than Audrey Campbell herself later this year, fans will have to wait a while longer to complete their collection.
I also recommend the following Something Weird double-features: ""Sinderella and the Golden Bra/Goldilocks and the Three Bares"", ""The Notorious Daughter of Fanny Hill/The Head Mistress"", ""Bad Girls Go to Hell/Another Day Another Man"" and ""The Violent Years/Girl Gang"".",1055894400,46,2188,5.146067415730337

7984225,3,B00008H2HK,"WARNING!!!!! I just bought a copy of this, I had tried earlier but it was out of print. The new in-print copies are DVD-R. They are dual layer and the quality looks good! However had I known it was a DVD-R I would never have bought it. Let the buyer beware. They really should tell you that these are professionally duped dual layer DVD-Rs with high quality printed on the disc art.",1328227200,13,382,4.319444444444445
7984226,5,B00008H2HK,"For all you sleazoid B movie freaks out there like myself, something weird video has done it again....... Three classic women dominating women films from times squares golden age. Olga takes no prisoners and is the riding crop wielding godmother to all modern badass women types. These films come from a time when sex was sinful and one had to go to a seedy movie theatre downtown to get off. Ah, the good old days.",1310428800,8,415,4.546666666666667
7984227,3,B00008H2HK,"Disc contains three ""Olga"" roughies made by George Weiss in 1964. In WHITE SLAVES OF CHINATOWN and OLGA'S HOUSE OF SHAME exploitation star Audrey Campbell is Olga, cruel despoiler of girls, who tortures victims as she reduces them to junkies and hookers. Campbell's performances and excellent cinematography by William Rose raise these a cut above typical genre fare. Films were shocking for their time and still occasionally disturbing, but not comparable to modern gore-fests. Lucy Eldredge plays Olga in forgettable OLGA'S DANCE HALL GIRLS. Includes usual rich SWV supplemental features. A must for exploitation fans, wholly unsuitable for anyone else.",1303344000,4,655,5.56
