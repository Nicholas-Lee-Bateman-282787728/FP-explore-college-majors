8496471,2,B006CG0ZC4,"The video seems to me to be a fair introduction to comparative Western religions from Egypt through to the end of the Roman Empire. The main theme is the death and replacement of gods and their religions. The DVD is sort of okay, but definitely not great, mainly because of the frequent errors in the narration. If this same video were recopied in full DVD resolution and the voice-over script edited to remove occasional mistakes, it would be very good. Normally, I'd suggest passing on this one, but I don't know of a 1-disc video on ancient religions to recommend that's any better!

What's on the disc:

The main program (menu `play movie') is a 1 hour review of western religions in sequence: Egyptian to Greek to Roman to Celtic and briefly back to Roman Christianity. The gist of the presentation is that each civilization's religion replaced the prior (blending is mentioned, but as an afterthought).

The presentation is a single-narrator voice-over of a mix of pan-around video of statues in museums and historic site video walk-throughs, silent actors re-enacting ancient scenes, and special-effect recreations of now-ruined temples. Standard style for History Channel / Discovery Channel / National Geographic, and so on.

The other part of the DVD (menu `play episodes') has 5 different half-hour programs that separately cover Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Inca, and Celtic religions. These shorter episodes have a different, British narrator, and seem to be the original material that the 1 hour program was spliced together from.

Didn't do their homework very well:

Co-existence and blending of religions is only mentioned briefly, or not at all. The video completely leaves out Mesopotamian, Cretian, Anatolian, and Germanic gods and religions, even though these influenced the Egyptian through Roman civilizations in the pre-Christian periods covered.

A glaring error was the claim that the Egyptian religions perished after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt (whereas the Egyptian cult of Isis was going strong more than 400 years later in Roman Egypt and far-away Rome). There were other, less clear half-mistakes, like the claim that the Romans took over their gods from the Etruscans, whereas republican Romans' gods were (by the Romans' own reckoning) a mix of their own native Roman gods, other Latin cities' gods, Etruscan gods, and foreign Greek gods. It seemed to me that a important miss was that the Romans during imperial times had self-admittedly forgotten the roles of several of their ancient gods.

Other, more picky factual errors that I caught in the Celtic section were: That the god Aengus belonged to the Fir Bolg (he was a D Dannan, the Fir Bolg's enemies); That the Dag Dia was a sun god (maybe, but that's just speculation presented as fact, and the god Lug was probably more of a sun god than the fatherly Dag Dia); That the horse-goddess Epona was the chief god of the Celts (blatantly false on multiple levels).

All of these are fairly simple errors that good editing, or script review by a competent scholar could easily catch and fix. If this is an attentive student's first video, the student is going to need more and better study material to wash out the wrong first impressions.

Poor video resolution:

The picture is unnecessarily grainy. The picture on the DVD is a small 16:9 image embedded in a 4:3 frame, instead of standard anamorphic widescreen. The consequence is that the video quality is poor: when it's expanded to a full 16:9 screen, you see less than half the resolution you would expect in 2005 when the 5 source videos were made, or 2008 when this DVD was put together. That seems very wrong to me for a video which is presenting images of museum artwork and ancient ruins.",1328313600,5,3739,4.975961538461538
