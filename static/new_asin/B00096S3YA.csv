2268214,5,B00096S3YA,"it's amazing what used to be on TV. Had this production been circa 2005, we would only have this on HBO.

  Can you imagine these stars on broadcast TV now? No way !!! Gandolfini; Quaid; Hannah; Tilly; Sheen ; et al. Are you Kidding?

 From the opening scenes of a terrorist kissing his Magic Bullet to watching Randy Quaid being humbled by Ms. Hannah ( naked and handcuffed to a golf hole), this 6 part series has it all. Terrific acting; well thought out script and Ted Demme AND Robert Altman too?

  this will be one of the better series you can watch this year. One can just picture David Chase watching episode one ( COLUMBUS DAY), and declaring loudly "" That's  my $%&*$&^ Tony Soprano!!

buy this immediately, and watch what quality television  used to be, before the Bushies took over.

Enjoy GUN, over & over.",1114300800,14,819,4.496598639455782
2268215,3,B00096S3YA,"This film contains two almost totally unrelated vignettes connected by a common gun.  A terrorist is apprehended in an airport, but before he is caught, he throws away a handgun that was previously used in an assassination.  After he is released, he obsessively seeks out the gun, which has by now been found and sold to Walter (James Gandolfini), a security guard who takes it home to his wife (Rosanna Arquette) to protect herself when he is on the night shift.  After various events (which I will refrain from spoiling), the gun ends up in a pawnshop.  From there, it finds its way to the next vignette.
It next belongs to the president of a country club in the Deep South.  When he is bitten by a rattlesnake while on the golf course and dies, the gun is lost in the tall grass.  The new president (Randy Quaid) is a philanderer who is fooling around with numerous women (Jennifer Tilly, Sean Young, Sally Kellerman, et al).  His wife (Daryl Hannah) seems oblivious to all this and contents herself by cooking the favorite recipes of dead presidents.  Suddenly, pieces of the gun are being received in packages addressed to all the president's lovers leading to his wife's discovery of his indicretions.
The first story is a well-crafted drama that draws the viewer in with two storylines, one following the terrorist and the other following Walter's wife Lily.  The second vignette is a short story by Robert Altman, which is an imbecilic farce.  It is not clear how these two short films were pasted together.  I can only guess that the first story was not commercially viable due to its short length.
The acting in the first vignette was excellent.  Gandolfini does his NYC working class shtick to perfection, strutting his corpulent Italian stuff around the set like a bloated stallion.  Rosanna Arquette is equally good, playing the bored NYC housewife to the hilt and delivering a surprisingly accurate performance including an excellent New York accent.
The second vignette had a good deal of recognizable talent, but nothing even remotely intelligent for them to say or do.  The dialogue and story were so bad that it is hard to understand why these veteran actors would want to be associated with the project.  Maybe Altman had some kind of damaging evidence against them.  To their credit, Randy Quaid and Jennifer Tilly made the best of a bad situation and delivered a couple of comical moments amid the mindlessness.
In rating this film, I had to split the rating in two.  The drama I rated an 8/10 and the comedy a 2/10.  Therefore, the average would be a 5/10.  It is worth seeing the first one, but if you dare to continue, turn off your VCR/DVD and drink a six-pack.  That is the only way second vignette is tolerable.",972604800,13,2738,4.724210526315789
2268216,3,B00096S3YA,"It was a weird TV show.  A show consisting of many celebrities but ONE gun.  It dealt with many murders and crimes.... all dealing with the same  gun.  From Robert Altman, did you expect less?  Now it's on DVD, so have  fun with it.",966902400,3,232,4.159090909090909

8057600,5,B00096S3YA,"I love this show!! I watched the episode ""Ricochet"" featuring Nancy Travis several times. That is the best episode on here, but the others are good too. There is so much suspense that I never get tired of watching. I wish Nancy were in the other episodes also, but she is just in the one.",1486339200,,288,4.254545454545455
8057601,1,B00096S3YA,"GUN is everything bad about American TV, all rolled up into one dreary package. Let me say, first, that If you're craving some Robert Altman, look elsewhere than here. Second, the premise of this series is that all the episodes feature the same gun, passing through different hands. Well, that's a lie. The gun is, indeed, the same prop in each episode--but it isn't the same fictional gun, as there are no connections between any of the stories. That is, this is not the continuing story of one, single gun being handed from owner to owner. It's unconnected stories about separate guns that all just happen to look alike. Thirdly, the stories run the stylistic and philosophical gamut, so even if you do enjoy one, that's no guarantee you'll like any of the others. Most of these tales are simply weak, TV-movie-ish, and pedestrian. The name actors are wasted--mIght as well watch episodes of the Love Boat. I fell asleep during one episode and didn't even bother to go back and see what I'd missed. Will never watch any of these twice.",1424476800,,1037,4.7032967032967035

8057603,5,B00096S3YA,"A great, expansive list of actors and they all did a very good job. I took notice of this set of movies because I had seen ""Babel"" and it is a movie in which a gun travels (as in these movies) and how that same gun changes peoples lives (these movies came about 10 years before ""Babel""--hmmm). I am a huge Robert Altman fan, as well. He gives everything credibility, so...... This movie is not action packed. It, instead, is methodical and, interesting, and intriguing. Very well presented. Irony is a central theme. I very much enjoyed viewing all 6 movies. It was, initially, a TV show and feels like a series to me. I really liked this package.",1412467200,2,647,4.445378151260504
