8714359,5,B00WUKHXYO,"Schuberts operas are his least known and most problematic works. He was smitten by opera at an early age and promptly tried his hand at composing one. He continued to write operas purely from his love of the genre, eventually producing fifteen, some complete and some left unfinished. These early operas are short, unassuming works in the ""Singspiel"" form, i.e., musical numbers with spoken dialogue, and are full of musical delights. But they have two consistent problems. The first is a lack of a certain operatic spark which we recognize in a born opera composer, and which manifests as an inborn knack for musical characterization and theatrical timing. The second is consistently poor librettos. These are the work of Schuberts amateur-poet friends and are clich-ridden, stilted, nave, and thoroughly undramatic.
In the early 1820s Schubert realized that opera was a good way for a composer to achieve popular and financial success; and he was caught up in the burgeoning idea of German Romantic opera, directly inspired by the success of Webers ""Der Freischtz"". Schubert contributed two major operas to the movement: ""Alfonso und Estrella"" and ""Fierrabras"". These are large-scale, three-act operas, full of beautiful music, expert vocal writing, and colorful orchestration. But neither achieved a performance during Schuberts lifetime. He was, after all, a young composer, and little-known outside his circle of friends. And he never managed to attract the attention and sponsorship of important people in the operatic world, without which his works had little or no chance of being even looked at by Viennas opera houses. After this disappointment, and knowing he was living on borrowed time because of his fatal illness, Schubert abandoned his operatic dreams and devoted his last five years to song and large instrumental works.
These last two operas have many of the same faults as the early ones, notably preposterous plots. But ""Fierrabras"" points toward what Schubert might have achieved had he continued with opera. The characters actually have some individuality and ambiguity, and there are some real dramatic moments. The operas biggest flaw is that it was for some reason written as a ""Singspiel"", with long stretches of spoken dialogue, encompassing both the backstory and many dramatic moments. But Schubert found a creative solution for these bits of drama, setting them as Melodrama (dialogue spoken over music), and they are very effective.
Fierrabras was not performed until 1897, and then in a heavily edited version. The first big-time, serious production was in Vienna in 1988, under the baton of Claudio Abbado. Judging by photographs, the production was standard Eurotrash, but it yielded a fine audio recording with a cast including Karita Mattila, Cheryl Studer, Josef Protschka, Robert Gambill, and Thomas Hampson. The present production, from the 2013 Salzburg Festival, restores the operas medieval setting, though very stylized, and the costumes are lovely. Since it was done in a small house the production is on a small scale. But, on the whole, it is straightforward and effective. All of Schuberts music is there, and the dialogue is cut to the minimum needed for dramatic coherence. The cast is also excellent. I was familiar only with Dorothea Rschmann and Michael Schade, but the rest are also splendid. Ingo Metzmacher leads a well-paced, affectionate performance, lacking only the musical and theatrical magic imparted by Abbado.
I would certainly recommend this DVD to lovers of Schubert and those wishing to expand their operatic horizons.",1474502400,2,3585,5.313380281690141
8714360,5,B00WUKHXYO,"Franz Schubert  composed music as bridal clothing for his mysticism.  And this opera stands as an ultimate expression of  the mystical foundation of western civilization.  Even as Fierrabras  was being composed that foundation was being shaken and would gradually disappear. That Schubert captured it in such glorious splendor is  a joy that I never expected to experience until I attended the opera in Salzburg. It was presented with immense insight  and with an appreciation of its depth.  Always there is beauty, beauty beyond belief, in the music. We are indebted to the Mozart Festival, the Vienna Opera, and to the courage and wisdom of the men who  brought about this production for a major contribution to the arts and to our lives. The DVD  gives to everyone an opportunity to  have a deep and enduring experience of life as defined by a tension between transcendence and our immanent world. Whatever you do buy this DVD.
The very existence of transcendence was an issue in nineteenth century Europe. But here transcendence is the backbone  of the life-view.  Reality is defined as a tension between a fragmented immanence and  an indefinable but  vibrantly real transcendence. Transcendence cannot be reduced to a formula, an idea, an ideology.  But in the lives of  the heroes and heroines of the opera it means something both unique and vital. For Fierrabras, the Moorish prince, it means the  heroic sacrifice  of  self-interest  for love. Others are called to love's triumph. The passage for each demands courage, fidelity to transcendental attraction.  Each man and woman has his or her own intuition of divine attraction.  And nowhere is the response arbitrary. The demand is for heroic fidelity. The promise is for an ascent to a higher and better world.
The  musical beauty through which this vision of reality is presented  never stops, never lets down.  The production is a thing of deeply satisfying  joy from beginning to end.

8714361,4,B00WUKHXYO,"The Vienna Philharmonic.  A solid traditional production from Salzburg.  The best . . . . except for a couple of singers.  The sopranos, out of sight.  The bass, formidable.  The tenors: unfortunately the one in the title role was really undistinguished.  I also thought this 2014 production was rather idiotic: the good Nordic race in white; the dastardly saracens in black .  Will the Germans ever eliminate racial stereotypes?  Probably not..  Given that the only other production is EUROTRASH abominable, I am quite glad to have this one.",1448841600,3,542,5.068181818181818
8714362,5,B00WUKHXYO,"Schubert was decidedly not a great composer of operas. Fierrabras 1823 is his last operatic creation. Based on a bad libretto, the music is very interesting. In my opinion the male choir without accompaniment of the orchestra, recalling the distant homeland in the second act, is the culmination of the work. Exelente idea of ''holding a video of this little-known work. The only other opportunity is a video made in Zrich with a grotesque production despite the participation of Jonas Kauffman. This production is radically different: conservative, even seems an adventure film for children. From a musical point of view it is absolutely perfect. Julia Kleiter in the role of Emma is a dream of vocal perfection. Georg Zeppenfeld, singing the king's role also has a remarkable voice. Also highlight the wonderful Dorothea Rschmann in the role of Florinda and the excellent Benjamin Bernheim in the role of Eginhard. Fierrabras, sung by the tenor Michael Schade , is sung well right way, without reaching the level of others. The orchestra and chorus are fantastic. The conductor Ingo Metzmacher, an advocate of contemporary music, shows he has an exceptional taste for this score still attached to standards classic. To know Firerrabras this DVD is perfect.",1435536000,12,1258,5.171568627450981
