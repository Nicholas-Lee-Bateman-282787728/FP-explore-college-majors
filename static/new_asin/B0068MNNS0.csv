4978875,1,B0068MNNS0,"We have seen scores of movies where the woman or daughter is kidnapped then the husband must use his special ops training skills to rescue them. This movie has a twist where the husband is kidnapped and the woman must go rescue him while obeying the kidnappers.

I was not very convinced of Catherine Bell knocking out large men with one punch any more than if Rick Moranis had played the part. She musters all her savvy to save her husband, going nonstop except for the moments she spends calling her daughter assuring her ""mommy will be home soon."" And who uses a 4 digit pass code?

I guess if you are a woman and need a super soccer mom role model, or just tired of men playing the ""knight"" this film would have some appeal to you from that angle. It is just that it was so poorly done.

Made for TV. Some violence. killing. Basically kid safe.",1330128000,2,848,4.320754716981132

4978889,4,B0068MNNS0,I actually like that the writers tried to put this into a timeline that lasted for only 4-5 hours during the movie instead of dragging it out for a couple of days. I would of liked to seen more fight sequences during the movie.,1377734400,,227,4.181818181818182

8494852,2,B0068MNNS0,"Watchable but not great made originally for TV low budget  movie, follows the formula of using an actress from a former TV show (Catherine Bell, J.A.G.) to get the viewers who were fans of her or that show. She's also teamed up with former teen star in the 80's Anthony Michael Hall (National Lampoon's Vacation, The Breakfast Club) who doesn't look a great deal like the nerdy teen characters he was famous for back then now as an ageing male character.  He's been a few TV movies (that weren't much better than this one) as an adult actor but ultimately is pretty wasted in this one, as he doesn't have much to do but comfort a child about microchiping her pet the next day and being tied up.  They could have got a non famous actor do that role, but I guess also wanted to draw a few fans of his to watch this one.

If you took out the fan clubs of either actor who just love anything they're in, I don't think many would rate Last Man Standing too highly.  Basically Bell's character is supposed to be some sort of bad ass from her days in the military who now has settled to be a soccer mom type wife to an older guy who is a veterinarian (Hall).  She hasn't really kept in touch with her former unit in her current civilian days, and of course regrets it when she gets a phone call telling her one of them took his own life.  So she goes to the funeral where she starts to remember stuff that went on in the war.  The next day she gets a video phone call of her husband gagged and tied up and is told he'll be killed if she doesn't follow instructions and get some information from the dead guy's house. She of course doesn't go to the cops, and just takes her daughter across the street (you'd think you'd be worried the daughter might get kidnapped but this thought doesn't occur to her).  Then it's your typical beat the bad guys, by not lethally taking out innocent police and security guard hurdles along the way and get the husband back alive type of film.

It's watchable but is full of stuff that makes no sense.  She's also supposedly a real highly trained combat bad ass as well as computer hacker but the only flashback scenes we see of her in her military days are of her riding around or standing next to a Humvee.  Spoiler scenes  - The woman is pretty small but can just reach over the top of a desk while crouched behind it and pull a much larger man quickly back to disable him.  She is told her husband is in a warehouse four miles away or something and no other information, especially an address yet has no problem finding the place.  She can out drive trained police officers who don't seem to know how the brake pedal or steering wheel works in a car.",1474502400,,2679,4.256410256410256
8494853,5,B0068MNNS0,I first saw this movie on cable and loved it so I bought the DVD.
