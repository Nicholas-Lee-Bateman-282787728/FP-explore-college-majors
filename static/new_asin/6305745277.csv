7894315,5,6305745277,"I thought the movie was great and I am 14 years old! Togepi is my favorite pokemon. I have a talking Togepi plush it is sooooo cute. I think Togepi is the cutest pokemon of all. I like the part when Togepi hatches and sees Misty and I also liked it when they find out that the first thing Togepi sees it thinks is its mother,I love that movie. I think Togepi is the best pokemon.",1059091200,,379,4.0

I wish  that I had my very own Togepi, but I guess that the only way to have my own  Togepi is the capture one on the Pokemon Gold/Silver games.",965174400,5,282,4.12962962962963
7894318,3,6305745277,"And what do you mean, gotta catch `em all, anyway? This video is about a 175th Pok&eacute;mon named Togepi. He (she? ) acts the same way most of the other Pok&eacute;mon do: say their own names (but not Meowth, Gastly, and Mewtwo).
Anyway, I've heard about ""The Power of One,"" the sequel to ""Mewtwo  Strikes Back,"" and that it will hit America in August. Two more are on the  way, too! Oh, no...that means there could be 500 Pok&eacute;brats in a couple of  years from now.
What do I care, though? I'm glad that soon this Pok&eacute;mon  craze will be over and done once and for all.",961632000,2,583,4.420560747663552
