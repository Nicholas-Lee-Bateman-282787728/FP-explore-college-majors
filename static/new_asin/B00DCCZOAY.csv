5788959,5,B00DCCZOAY,I watched it for the old actors of the pass I haven't seen their work in it before. enjoyed it recommend it for people who like the classic series.,1394841600,,147,4.103448275862069
5788960,4,B00DCCZOAY,"This is comparable to season 6. Again, there is no way to see what the shows are about and what guest stars are the show until you go through each one, which tedious and time consuming. I would of preferred that this be in one volume, and they should not charge more money for that since it's one season. Again, the show is a 5 but the issues bring it down. I understand these shows are older, but they can do better cleaning or editing job, if they wanted, considering that MOD sets are quite high. Another 5 star but the issues bring it down.",1389312000,,544,4.190476190476191
5788961,4,B00DCCZOAY,"FIRST watched it in the 70s
Maybe because this was pre-FBI scandal but as a kid, joining Insp Erskine was a dream of mine
The show deals with crimes from a simpler era
Which is not to say the show is unbelievable or bad

Although chances are, if you grew up on reality-type shows, you probably won't enjoy it that much.",1388707200,2,319,4.229508196721311
5788962,1,B00DCCZOAY,"Caveat I just read after inserting this in 4 different DVD players including my laptop is that it won't play in anything but a play only device.  Will not play in a recorder or dvd rewrite.  A bit useless in this day and age.  Who even has a DVD Play only device?  Will have to return, shame.",1388448000,,292,4.0701754385964914

8591701,5,B00DCCZOAY,This is the fifth season of the classic T.V. program that ran from about 1965 until 1973.  The action is fantastic and the stars really carry the program and there are many familiar faces in the series.  This is one example of an action T.V. program that you may never see the likes of again.  A must have.,1429574400,,306,4.241379310344827
