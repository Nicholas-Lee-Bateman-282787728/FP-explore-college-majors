They push possible EMP attack as an Iranian threat, well surprise hillbillies, EMP attack is part of any nations nuclear first strike. I want these crazies out just like everyone else, but another invasion in the middle east is not the answer. This film not only leaves out critical data, it spins the same old stuff we already know into a whirlpool trying to create a new threat. Dont be dumb enough to let this terrible piece of propaganda film making have an effect on you. Yes they need to go, and they will when the people of Iran are ready.  Sean Hannity spins this as a wakeup call, he must have been asleep for the last 10 years, welcome to the same old take on the same old Iran.

This movie is pretty dated and world events currently show that almost all the fears and predictions that are presented did not come true and the world is in a much different situation than predicted. We are pretty much responsible for the mess that exists in the middle east by the Bush administrations invasion of Iraq that was completely misguided and completely ignored the real perpetrators of 9/11. We have no business trying to pick sides in  this medieval war between two ridiculous religious religions. 9/11 was orchestrated by  Saudi Arabia who is supposed to be our ally.

The real propaganda is obviously the vomit coming out of those leaders preaching death to all the people, countries and religions they despise.

So back to reviewing Iranium, it was well put together, it touches briefly on the history of how everything unfolded between Iran and the USA revolving Iran's nuclear progression. It also touches on their threats to the USA and world, also it shows their leaders using propaganda and control over their people to act out what they believe is their religious duty or whatever you want to call it.

4392129,5,B004K11L6W,"""Embrace Islam so that you may be safe, or else make a treaty of protection for yourself and your people, for I have brought to you a people (i.e. Muslim fighters) who love death as much as you love life."" al-Walid letter to Harmuz as found in ""Sharia versus Freedom.""  Bostrom (2012) The Mohammedan love of death - those they kill and their own - has long fascinated me. At the April 2015 Kenyan Garrisa University slaughter of 148 targeting Christians the mujahidin killers allegedly proclaimed ""We have come to kill and to be killed.""

The Islamic Republic of Iran, as does ISIS, imitates with fearful fidelity the life of Mohammed. Fighters from 100 nations have joined Sunni ISIS because it is true to Mohammed and the death he promised to them and to all who opposed them. Iran's Shiite leaders are equally true believers using Mohammed's cult of killing and being killed. Both Iran and ISIS do what they do in order to bring the whole world into ""submission"".

""Iranium"" is scary because it is true. Few things thrill a mujahidin, whether it's the suicide bombers, the WTC or Iran's mullahs, than the thought of the mutual annihilation of their enemies (i.e. the entire non-Muslim world) and themselves.  Well maybe there is one other thing more enticing to this culture of death, and that is the destruction of Israel as they simultaneously incinerate themselves.

Iranium helped me understand why Sec of State Kerry's negotiations to interrupt Iran becoming a nuclear power were doomed to failure by 1400 years of Mohammedan history. The thought of Mutually Assured Destruction by nuclear weapons rather than being a deterrent is rather an enticement if not a downright turn-on for Iran's leaders.

I have read a fair amount about Mohammedanism, which based upon my reading, is faithfully practiced by ISIS and Iran. ISIS and Iran are not to be dismissed as ""radical Islam"" - they are not. Rather, they are the pure, faithful and ultimate realization of Mohammed. Winston Churchill ""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia (i.e. rabies) in a dog..."" In the west we cannot understand their mind set - their love of death and goal of world-wide submission to Allah and his imams. Western tolerance for Muslim intolerance and its cult of death will per Iranium in the end lead to our deaths whether it's at Fort Hood, random US roadside killings for Allah, or Charlie Hebdo, or the London underground, or the WTC or the supermarket in your neighborhood because it sells wine and pork chops.

Iranium explains why Iran's leaders do what they do and gives us a head's up on what they are going to do, John Kerry's best efforts notwithstanding.  Iran is going to make and use nuclear weapons as soon as they can and they will realize their spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini's vision for Iran. Study his face, just study it, and that should confirm the soul of the Ayatollah and Iranium's warning.",1428710400,,3007,4.836575875486381

This was nothing but anti-Iran propaganda and that's what you get when you have people Like Eliot Engel, Dore Gold and James Woolsey in a documentary. The only thing accurate was the date of events and some comments which were taken completely out of context.

The Clever thing to do was to have an Iranian Dissident/Hollywood actress like Shohreh be your narrator to build your credibility. First of all Iran was not responsible for any of the 9/11 attacks or the other terrorist attacks that Al Qaeda was implemented in. Iran absolutely hated Al Qaeda and the Taliban so there is no way they were helping them. Second of all having news clips from Cnn and propagandists fox doesn't raise your credibility much either. Third of all if you are going to make an anti Iranian documentary I suggest you don't interview people who are die hard Israel supporters and extremely anti Iranian from the conservative sector.

 I find it extremely illogical is to try to bolster the capabilities of Iran while ignoring the capabilities of the united States, Israel and the gulf countries.

4392143,4,B004K11L6W,"I stumbled upon this title because it looked lonely on Amazon Instant watch.  I'm somewhat glad I did but I'm going to need something a bit less tense to come down after this.

In a nutshell this is a brief history lesson on Iranian politics from the Shah of Iran's departure, the Iranian hostage crisis, the formation of the Islamic Constitution, Beirut, Yemen and 9-11.  Then it spins up for quite a while about Iran's attempts to obtain nuclear weapons and the potential for an EMP (Electromagnetic pulse) attack to destroy the American way of life in one fell swoop.  On top of this they add that this is a culture that has been known to execute women by hanging because they ""allowed"" themselves to be raped.  All in all it's a pretty terrifying picture.  The quote that stood out for me most was from a Middle East expert who said of Iran contrasting it with the Cold War: ""For Iran, Mutually Assured Destruction is not a deterrent but an inducement.""  It closes by addressing the simple question of what we could ever do to avoid this grim fate.

So on the positive side, it did its job wonderfully.  This is a chilling bit of film-making.  The film references a fairly wide variety of sources from military experts to U.S. lawmakers and makes its case reasonably well.  I'm not ready to go learn to drive a tank but this topic does bear some careful thought.

To the negative, it must be remembered that this is a political/propaganda film so everything they say should be taken with a grain of salt.  They have some good facts but they're really just one side of the story.

In summary, don't show the kids or they'll be hiding under their desks.

4392144,1,B004K11L6W,"Outrageous - people seem to think Iran is  a bunch of arabs running around in sand plotting to attack the United States. Well truth of the matter is that Iran has not attacked another nation in hundreds of years (they have fought wars but only when attacked). They possess no nuclear weapons, have signed the nonproliferation treaty and chemical weapons ban treaty. Also very few people seem to realize that Iran is a secular nation with Jews (who are well enough happy they choose NOT to go to Israel though they ARE free to go should they choose), Muslims of all flavors, Christians (where the Christmas decorations in Tehran are some of the most beautiful in the world and muslims even giving gifts to their friends that celebrate it), Hindus, Buddhists, etc.
As we discuss things that people do not know I would take a gander that most are unaware of the fact that Israel (the most belligerent nation in the Middle East) DOES have a massive nuclear and chemical weapons stockpile and refuses to sign any treaty to dispose, stifle creation of, or inspect. Why is it that the United States has befriended that terrorist nation of which research and massive evidence show they are perhaps the best provable candidate for the murders that took place on 9/11 including the arrest of dancing and celebrating Mossad spy agents in New Jersey whom state on Israeli TV they were sent to film the incident. The dual citizens in congress (US/Israel) are required by Israel to make Israel its number one priority in regards to loyalty and boy does it show. America's belligerence at the UN to sanction Israel for use of chemical weapons on Palestinians always gets its veto of protection. The United States arrests thousands of Israeli spies to only quietly deport them. In Syria the false accusations Assad used chemical weapons on his people was provided by none other than Israel. It was the rebels that used them which include al Qaeda which the US backs by sending tax payer money and weapons. By Obama's own law he and those in congress should be arrested and held indefinitely for supporting our enemy. The constitution declares they be given the death sentence for their crimes.
I assure you this is most likely a video made by shills for Israel. Unfortunately the facts i have given here will never be seen on Zionist mainstream TV news. Shame on all who do not research and grasp whom our real enemies are. It would do us great healing to abandon Israel and sanction them for their terror and warmongering, demand Washington to stop its terror and lying, and befriend the peaceful nation of Iran.",1381363200,8,2597,4.745575221238938

4392146,5,B004K11L6W,"This is a real life horror movie.  It warns of the horror of doing nothing while screw-loose maniacs in Iran prepare to facilitate the return of their ""Messiah"" by initiating the literal destruction of America by a single EMP bomb.  Experts estimate that such a bomb would kill 100,000,000 Americans within six months and between 75% and 90% of the US population, i.e. you and me, eventually as we fight it out for the remaining food stocks in the country, or try to grow food from hybrid seeds that do not self-replicate.  It is not a pretty picture that emerges from this movie but doing nothing is likely a very bad option.  If you watch this movie, or the free version online, and disagree with this assessment, please explain your logic to me and we'll see whether it can stand up to review from the 6,000,000 Jews that died in the last century because they refused to believe what another screw-loose maniac said that he would do to them.",1348704000,2,944,4.568047337278107

It has everything to do with our country being slowly taken over by the extreme Islam followers that literally hate America and the western countries.  It will make you sick to hear them chant ""Death to America"" and know that they really want that to happen.  I think every American needs to watch this movie.  It will make the issues of the Economy seem very minimal, but will also explain why we need to continue to be a strong country and not allow ourselves to rely on China and other countries for everything.",1310947200,5,639,4.5701754385964914
4392150,5,B004K11L6W,"well done. i have known all of the treachery of Islam for many years.
Now this documentary puts some of it in the open. This documentary is not about opinions, rather it is a collection of factual events and of public statements of Iranian officials at the highest levels of governement.
If Israel does not destroys the nuclear facilities of Iran soon, there may not be an Israel anymore .
In my opinion it is unavoidable that a war will break out between the west/israel and the muslims/arabs.
The rationale is the following:  arab/muslim leaders maintain their power base through terror on their own populations and through a well paid security apparatus that is justified with unrelenting lies about the west and unrelenting lies about their own military capabilities.
we have seen this with Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mao etc.
In order to retain their power base they have to continue to escalate their rhetoric rants of war against the west.
the war will be uneventful.
the arabs are well versed in the koran and that's about it, but that does not help win wars.

As an example of what can be expected in a war between Israel and the arabs, consider the following:
Notwithstanding the help of soviet technology, the largest tank battle of the iraqi war in 1991 witnessed the destruction of over 1,000 iraqi tanks against the loss of 1 dead and 4 wounded to the american forces.
Israel can dispatch the arabs in a matter of days.
Bombing the arab power plants and power transformer stations will cripple communications, food storage, water pumping, food preparation and transportation.
Then by bombing the oil production storage and pumping facilities, will make the arabs irrelevant to the world economy for the next 10 years.

Remember this is not an indictment of the majority of Iranian people, who yearn for freedom, but of the extreme fundamentalists who run their government and the brain washed robots who support them.

Also please note that the 5 negative reviews on this site were posted either by a group of friends, or the same two people under different names. They most likely have not seen the movie. Clearly they are giving the movie a poor review as revenge for what they perceive as US support for Saddam Hussein during the Iraq-Iran war.

8432084,1,B004K11L6W,"Simply put this documentary is FEAR MONGERING. It mixes facts with fiction in order to create an attractive otherisation propaganda.
I will analyze one example from the documentary here to elucidate the point:
They talk about the doctrine which the savior (12th imam) is bound to come in Islamic ideology and they implicitly point to the saying(hadith) that indicates the savior will come when situations are dire in the world. Afterwards they proceed to make their claim from the speeches of ex president ahmadinejad and supreme leader khamenie'e. Their speeches usually start with a prayer asking god to hasten the arrival of the savior. From this , the ""experts"" in the film extrapolate that they must want to hasten the dire situations in the world by themselves so that the savior would come faster. And from there the argument proceeds that the doctrine of MAD(Mutual assured destruction) which worked for Russia and the US will not work for Iran and other parties. Because Iran could care less and just wants destruction so it will destroy everything and thus itself be destroyed which then hopefully the savior will come.
If the problematic reasoning is not clear then I will try to clarify the matter. It is clear that dire situations in the world is created by men, there is no doubt about that but to claim that Iranian officials actually want to create extreme dire situations is a stretch. The Iranian government claims to be the state in which the savior will rule from. If we take all these symbolic religious talk literally (the documentary is literalist in its interpretations) then we have to assume that the Iranian government needs its base to not be a nuclear wasteland in order for the savior to rule from there. A nuclear eradicated wasteland is not really the most ideal place for the last imam(savior) to establish a base in. Therefore I think the real premise found between the line  is the idea that westerners are logical while middle easterners are not. The white men were logical thus they abode by the MAD , however middle easterners are subhuman, illogical and rather devilish thus they will never abide by the MAD doctrine. This seems as a very problematic ideology to have if we are ever to have reconciliation between peoples in the world.",1487030400,2,2274,4.845758354755784
