7979379,1,B000087F22,"Due to my high threshhold for pain (or love for all things low brow), I am able to endure, if not, enjoy many movies that most people would use as a coaster or as a table leg extension.  However, I think I just found a movie that I would use as a frisbee.  Treasure Hunt has to be one of the dumbest things I've ever watched.  Let's be honest, when you watch a sexy 'B'-flick, you expect certain things: cheesy humor, cheesy acting, cheesy sets, and skin.  I'm still waiting for any of these elements to show up in this movie.  I couldn't call this movie a B-flick because that would be insulting the B-flick genre.  That's how bad this movie is.  Listen to the other reviewers, don't bother with this turkey.",1087344000,2,709,4.325757575757576
7979380,1,B000087F22,"The people who put this on DVD have chosen to put out this heavily censored version with virtually all the good nude/sex scenes removed... why?  Absolutely no clue... when softcore studios do this it is absouletly unexplainable.  What fools..!
Don't waste your money, it's completely worhtless in every way.",1051574400,11,307,5.244897959183674
