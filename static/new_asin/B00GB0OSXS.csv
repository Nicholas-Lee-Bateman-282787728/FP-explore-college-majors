While films of this type are usually a bit slow, the many interesting characters kept my attention throughout.  I highly recommend a viewing of this film, particularly for AJ, Alicia, and Billy fans!",1393113600,2,319,4.763636363636364
6069639,5,B00GB0OSXS,"The film presents an interesting premise where a young girl (AJ Michalka) relies on a fictional cowboy character (Billy Burke) as a role model in a rural community that looks like the 1980's.  Alicia Silverstone provides a change from her ""Clueless"" days and delivers a strong performance in a dramatic role.  AJ is the one that really steals the show though as the daughter that must make it on her own.

There are several quirky characters, and light moments that will make you laugh. Its a fun way to spend a Friday night.  This is one to watch.",1393113600,6,548,4.561224489795919
6069640,5,B00GB0OSXS,"I really enjoyed Angels In Stardust. It is a coming of age film that takes place in a quirky little town built on an abandoned drive-in movie theater lot. After the first 20-30 minutes of character development, the film really opens up. Silverstone (Tammy) is brilliant in her performance as a single mother raising children in a struggling trailer park community. She had me crying at times, and sometimes shocked at her desperate attempts to improve her life. In my opinion, this is her best performance ever, a very different roll for her. Burk (Cowboy) and Michalka (Valley Sue) are amazing in their rolls. I was intrigued at how Valley Sue's life weaves between fantasy and reality with the Cowboy. Through creative cinematography and clever special effects, the film contrasts the harsh reality of being born poor with the hope created by dreams. This is a film for the whole family (13 years+), but will be enjoyed most by mothers and teenage daughters.",1393113600,,960,4.895705521472393
6069641,5,B00GB0OSXS,"I really enjoyed this film. The story of a young girl (AJ Michalka) trying to make the best of her not so great life while taking care of her little brother because her mother (Alicia Silverstone) is useless, only concerned about her own future.  Tenkill (Michael Spears) stole my heart and this film. The only thing that would have pushed this movie to the next level would have been less of Billy Burke's cowboy character, which at times made the film a bit confusing and choppy, and more of Michael Spears.",1393027200,4,509,4.593406593406593
6069642,5,B00GB0OSXS,"Admittedly, a few parts of this film are difficult to watch, but the payoff is watching a young girl overcome her sad place in a poor community and life in general, to make something of herself. Decide for yourself if the ""Cowboy"" is a real character; I was never quite sure, but he sure was interesting to watch!

Alicia Silverstone does a terrific acting job in this flick, playing a over-the-hill (really? at only 31? LOL!) mother who is way beyond unreliable and irresponsible. You'll probably love to hate her in the end, but her young daughter makes the best of HER life, at least.",1392854400,5,587,4.59047619047619
6069643,1,B00GB0OSXS,"The movie was not family friendly and had cursing, many sexual scenes and gestures, and blasphemy as well. If you are looking for a clean film this is surly not the one. This should have been rated ""R"" for the adult content.",1427500800,,224,4.357142857142857
6069644,5,B00GB0OSXS,Great performance by Alicia Silverstone as a single mom with questionable parenting skills.  AJ Michalka and Billy Burke put in solid performances. It's a teen drama with some funny moments.  It's worth an night with some popcorn.,1412812800,,230,5.1891891891891895

6069647,1,B00GB0OSXS,"There are times when a movie is so bad, that it's hard to even review it.  That's the case with this one.  Everything about it is bad - plot, acting, writing, sets, etc.  Waste of time.",1404259200,,185,4.083333333333333
6069648,1,B00GB0OSXS,"The cover of the DVD is excellent and that is the only good thing about this piece of garbage.  This is not a family movie and it deals with the lowest white trash people you will ever see.  As a change of pace only the two kids have any redeeming values and are nice.  Still the teen daughter jumps into a physical fight with Alicia Silverstone, the trailer trash mom.  The daughter spends a lot of time talking to her imaginary cowboy friend.  Overcoming adversity - the mom dumps the kids to go off and marry a retired rodeo rider who doesn't want kids.  The young boy is left with a nearby Indian who is really his father, but never tells him.  The girl sets out to reach her potential by hitch hiking to Oklahoma City, dyeing her hair black so she can pretend to be an Indian so she can stay at a boarding house to try and get a scholarship to go to a school there.  And this is the ending.  This is not a feel good movie and I just have no idea why these other people wrote good reviews.  Just want to warn you folks!!",1401753600,6,1024,4.100502512562814
6069649,5,B00GB0OSXS,"This movie has a lot of complex characters . Vallie is a sweet kid who makes the best out of the life she was dealt . Michael Spears did an awesome job as Tenkill, no surprise as he is a fantastic actor . Billy Burke rocked it as a cowboy. I still watch this movie twice a week.",1398038400,,278,3.810344827586207
6069650,5,B00GB0OSXS,"A really Good movie, that give you a taste of every emotion on the scale. Both about what going on in Vallie Sue's family with her brother and mother, But also on the more society level.
The Character Tenkill, Has such an important part in the movie. a must see...",1395878400,,264,4.3
6069651,5,B00GB0OSXS,The cast was awesome... All of them!! The little brother Pleasant (adam Taylor) really touched your heart!!! It was a true down to earth movie!!,1393459200,4,144,4.8
6069652,3,B00GB0OSXS,"""Anything's possible in Tardust."" Vallie Sue (Michalka) is a small town girl with normal problems like everyone else. Her mother Tammy (Silverstone) regularly leaves her and her brother alone while she tries to find a new husband. Her brother hangs around an Indian who everyone says is dangerous. She has a few friends but her best friend is an imaginary cowboy who lives on the old drive-in screen in the town she lives in. In the middle of all this Valley does all she can to find herself and break free of the town to follow her own dreams. Going into this I was expecting a religious themed movie. If you are thinking that as well you will be disappointed. While there is a few moments of that this is not a religious movie at all. That said the movie is good and entertaining and I did end up liking it but it is not a happy movie. The only real complaint I have with this is that they had too many stories going on at once and not all of them got resolved. Not just minor ones but major ideas that get you interested but leave you hanging. When you watch you will see what I mean. Other then that though the movie is worth seeing. Overall, bittersweet and worth checking out but too many story lines are left open and it left the movie feeling unfinished. I give this a B.",1393372800,,1279,4.267489711934156

8621842,4,B00GB0OSXS,"The title ANGELS IN STARDUST (originally called JESUS IN COWBOY BOOTS) would indicate Hallmark Channel-type fare yet it turns out to be a much darker, harder-edged tale that will surprise (and perhaps dismay) those who might be expecting a more lighthearted movie.  This quirky mix of fantasy and brittle drama is not for all tastesat times its too intense for very young viewersbut I appreciated the ambitious and challenging approach to the storytelling, despite the rambling narrative and some (deliberately) inconclusive subplots.  It struck me as a sort of rural GHOST WORLD, though the overall results are not as successful.
The film is anchored by strong lead performances by AJ Michalka (THE GOLDBERGS) and Alicia Silverstone (CLUELESS), with Michalka quite impressive as a level-headed outcast whose dreams of a better existence are continually upended by the actions of her self-centered, irresponsible mother (Silverstone, giving one of her best performances).  The rest of the cast lend excellent support.
Again, this is not for everyone.  But that doesnt lessen the films virtues, which are enough to carry it through some uneven passages.",1501200000,,1152,5.383333333333334
