4839115,5,B005MY4LC2,I recently purchased this DVD for my nephew. He is thrilled with it and its content. I am pleased with the speed with which I received the  DVD. I will shop with this company again.,1334707200,4,181,4.171428571428572
4839116,4,B005MY4LC2,This is a well researched scientific discussion of the basic building blocks of life.  It is very technical and could bog down those are not scholarly minded.  It makes a very strong case for Intelligent Design.,1323129600,3,211,4.833333333333333
4839117,5,B005MY4LC2,"To put shortly, basic fundamental reality behind physical interactions and interoperability is grounded in information.
Information shapes life at molecular and biochemical level.
Information is NOT something that is accidentally generated by shifting and moving physical particles around.
Authors of this video explain the difference between probable, possible, feasible, and impossible using quantitative statistical approach. And emphasize how living organisms are driven by information-rich
Generally speaking, analogy between living organism and computer systems should be taken with reservation. But if the point is simply to illustrate presence and necessity of information processing in both, then point is well taken.
Furthermore, as in any information processing there is a need for (a) intent to convey information, (b) ability, (c) means, (d) communication protocol, (e) error correction , etc.
All of these are practically impossible for, and categorically different from, random shifting of molecules or particles. In other words, information is not a property of molecules or particles. They are governed by information prescriptively. Needless to say, that the very proteins that work in DNA replication, transcription, repair, etc. are themselves structurally, information-wise derived form that very DNA.
All in all should be a food for thought, BUT only to those who are not dogmatically fideistic naturalists.",1321574400,5,1429,5.975609756097561
4839118,5,B005MY4LC2,"This DVD is exceptionally well done.  It challenges the traditional ""Carl Sagan philosophy of life"", namely that the universe is all there is, all there was and all there ever will be.  Information is portrayed as a non-material entity, which is not derived from the laws of nature.  The challenge is to realize that as life is only possible because of what Dr. Johnson terms ""prescriptive information"" being present, the material descriptions of origins (i.e. neo-Darwinian evolution), as are commonly accepted, cannot possibly make sense. This entertaining DVD needs to be seen in every high school science class room as it will make students think, in a non-threatening way, about the all important subject of: what and who are we?  It has really expanded my thinking on the subject and I thank Dr. Johnson for making the effort to make this subject appealing and easy to understand for most audiences.",1318550400,17,905,5.013333333333334
4839119,5,B005MY4LC2,"I have recently seen this video in its entirety, and must say that it is very well made, beautiful in both it's scope and production, accessible to both the scientist and layperson, comprehensive in it's presentation with exceeding detail, and compelling to say the least.

With a foundation of scientific observations as a bedrock of scientific integrity, this video effectively calls into question dogmatic, materialist assumptions about the inner workings of the cell, assumptions that are presently becoming as archaic as the assumption of protoplasm was in Darwin's day. The video presents the complex, functional specificity of some of the individual components of the cell are highlighted, inviting further investigation and interest for students, faculty, scientists and the general public.

Never has the cell enjoyed such a time of unparalleled interest and wonder, as it's inner secrets of purpose, precision and beauty are uncovered in such a rich and vivid way. I encourage everyone to obtain and watch this video, and share it with others. This video is game-changing, ground-breaking, world view challenging and sure to evoke further interest and discussion in matters pertaining to the origin of life, the cell, the coded language of DNA and the exciting field of Information Science.

4839141,1,B005MY4LC2,"It was intelligent design anti-evolution bs, they gave simplistic explanations of things to get some credibility before 75% in they start to say how astronomical the odds of live starting are. They had some laughable stat something like the odds of life starting on its own in 10 to the 340 power, no explanation how they got to that number, then say that's there's 10 to the 100th power atoms in the universe (a true statistic), then some other crazy thing that's 10 to the 303 power. I get you could say it's very unlikely that life could form on its own, but do we really need to use such a stupid fake number for the given odds.

Evolution is a fact, if only these people spent a little more time trying to understand how it happens they might get it, instead they'd rather waste the time trying to confuse people with phony logic.",1455580800,2,835,4.422077922077922

4839143,1,B005MY4LC2,"I can excuse sloppiness like repeatedly calling biological chemicals ""computers"", but such sloppiness is excessive throughout this film. Then 20 minutes in the blatant lies begin, and get bigger and more frequent as the remaining 24 minutes of creationist propaganda and anti-science rhetoric continues to be passed off as pro-science.  Since they seem to like analogies so well, imagine a factory building a truck out of parts that were hauled to the factory by truck. Well, obviously there's no way that could get started without a miracle, huh? I mean, without the wheels being already on the trucks that hauls the wheels to be put on the trucks, how would the ever get things rolling? And consider the people who work at the factory which makes the trucks. Out of the over 7 billion people on our planet, if you randomly picked from them the number of people that work at a given truck factory, what are the odds that the ones you randomly picked would actually be the same ones who work at that factory?  Again, it must have taken a miracle for all those workers to end up at the factory, right? I mean, they could have been scattered all over the planet.  In fact, the universe is so huge, the chances of those workers actually being on Earth are so astronomically small, you might as well call it infeasible, or operationally impossible. That's what the people who made this film would have called it... if they felt that would help them to convince people that science is just one hoax after another and that the world is far too mysterious to understand without unscientific religious claims to explain it all.",1454457600,3,1619,4.713780918727915
4839144,1,B005MY4LC2,"I reluctantly watched this until they wrote the probability of a cell arising from chemical  reactions is 1 in 1E340,000,000. This is absolutely false and it was enraging to see that a lie of this magnitude could be presented as fact. The first problem with this is that ""probability"" cannot be loosely applied to the formation of a cell, because the atoms and molecules have tendencies to form certain structures. Many of which are contained in cells. Most famously is the cell membrane which is formed by lipids in a charge-driven process. It had nothing to do with probability in the way presentedit's simply the polarity of the lipids that ""forces"" them to assemble in such a manner. The second problem with this probability is that it is based on a ""modern"" cell, not a protocell. It is likely that self-replicating molecules went through phases to form simple protocells. No one believes that a complex, nucleated, evolved cell just formed 3.6 billion years ago. It's a set of phases that formed the first cell. The film was like reading an Answers in Genesis article of oversimplifications, leading to a biased conclusion. The amount of rhetorical and scientific fallacies in this film was thoroughly annoying and I would not recommend this to anyone who's interested in learning anything more than a filtered, rudimentary report on what they already believe to be true.",1452470400,2,1377,4.961038961038961
4839145,1,B005MY4LC2,"Don't be fooled by it. This program is religious propaganda. It makes unwarranted conclusions from several pretended ""facts"" about chemistry, biology, probability, and information theory.",1451779200,3,187,6.52
4839146,1,B005MY4LC2,"This video is well made, but misleading. Evolution has nothing to do with the origin of life. I can only image how Craig Venter, and the other scientists quoted in this film feel about involuntarily supporting this religious propaganda.",1451520000,2,236,5.076923076923077
4839147,1,B005MY4LC2,"The agenda is obvious when the viewer is constantly told to exercise ""critical thinking"" in only one direction.  I have little doubt that science will never be able to answer many of the ""big"" questions (we may not even be asking the right questions), but this video is just a repackaging of the same old Intelligent Design arguments.  Well suited for Protestant churches and private schools.",1448841600,13,392,4.924242424242424
4839148,1,B005MY4LC2,"Superbly disguised attempt to prove intelligent design theory.  (Just fyi, I am a practicing Episcopalian.  I have two Ivy league degrees, one in liberal arts and the other in engineering.  I have worked at NASA with supercomputers. )  It reminds me of fundamentalist Christian propaganda movies that start out very intelligent and then slowly slides into ignorant oversimplifications.  If I hadn't done research with computers at a top university that clearly refutes this, I might have been convinced.  I'll use his own admonition to ""think critically"" and apply it to this video.  1. Is Dr. Don Johnson affiliated with an accredited university biology department?  If so, which university?  None was given in the credits.  The narrator has no academic credentials listed.  How do we know he even has a high school diploma?  2. What have top biologists said in response to this kind of argumentation?  Richard Dawkins refutes all the arguments against evolution presented here.  In his book, ""Climbing Mount Improbable"" and ""The Blind Watchmaker"" he gives more than adequate explanation.  I was troubled as a Christian understanding how God evolved us.  I am proud to say that I understand now through the effort that God wants us to put into our thinking that Evolution isn't about who made us, it's about how we were made.",1448496000,5,1326,5.069444444444445

4839150,5,B005MY4LC2,"Well done.

I liked this video.  Its a video you can show your friends who are willing to listen to a strictly science based discussion of evidence against evolution, without a faith or religious perspective included.  It basically just presents the science of how much design and complexity there is in DNA and biochemistry and molecular biology.  That the cell could not have come about by natural processes.  And also how the secular establishment is not coming to terms with the major problems with this theory.

Its a friendly presentation about real facts:  evolution doesn't have a mechanism to create new genomic information.  Mutations aren't shown to create new information in the genome, and even if there is a single beneficial point mutation, you'd have to have thousands of them at once to build the right new organ system, parts, etc.  And some things require many parts at once for them to work and for the organism to reproduce.  The probability is operationally impossible.  You'd be relying on blind chance to create everything you see in the world.

All are entitled to their own belief systems, however, I disagree with the way science is used to sway belief in this film.  Aside from the recognition that this is slightly intended to be manipulative, I think the first half is good and comes from unbiased resources on biology.  It has quite a good review on basic biology and physiology through the first half of the film.

In summary, I think the film is worth a watch and has some beneficial content.  I also agree with many of the messages of keeping an open mind in scientific exploration.  My only discontent is the direction that they are attempting to subtly sway that skepticism.",1442966400,2,777,4.676470588235294

I wish I could give it a 5 stars rating, but I just don't see how this video demonstrates that we should have doubts about the theory of evolution. First of all, we have observed evolution, we have found fossil records distributed on the right geological layers. We have the DNA records of different species, and we are able to see how it unveils in a tree of life. And more than that, the theory evolution is consistent with biology, geology, astronomy, and many other sciences.

But the bigger misconception of the author is to presume that theory of evolution has anything to do with the origin of life. Theory of evolution deals with the origin of species. Actually, the only problem I see on this video is the pointless arguments against evolutionary theory.",1439337600,11,915,4.648148148148148

Even worse, the fact that the primary author is a Christian will be given as support to ""stay away"" from such non-scientific material, however the only reason to not watch this DVD is if you are unwilling to follow the truth wherever it leads..

The video takes an Intelligent Design approach to its topic. I can live with that, but I prefer a straight up acknowledgment that we and the planet are created over six literal days as described in Genesis. However, I understand that some prefer to separate the question of being created from that of who did the creating.

Toward the end, the video went over some statistical improbabilities. Some odds were given of different things happening, but those numerical odds are not supported; they are merely asserted. I'm not even convinced that it is valid to think in terms of the odds in the cases given, and the video seems to go on to agree with me. So why give the odds in the first place if it is not valid to think in those terms?

4839169,1,B005MY4LC2,"This a DVD that attacks evolution

PROS:
The first 25 min is a nice animation that explains how Cells & DNA.

CONS:
1.- A good deceiving religion DVD that avoid to mention religion, god, bible, etc. They camouflage their DVD in science talk to attack evolution. In religion one of the main protocols is NO to deceive and they did that in this DVD, by not letting the public know their true intention and what are they coming from. SHAME on you publisher!!!

2.- Since at this moment science does not have all the answers to DNA, they  insinuate that science/evolution is wrong and the answer should be some place else (they constrain themselves by not saying look in the bible)

3.- They explain their science from  their point of view and do not share the arguments from evolution

4.- They mention that the probability to have life by chance/evolution is not possible, because the biological events that we know are hard to combine in an event (A mathematical event) . They forgot to mention that it is possible to have a god creating everything with out any mathematical evidence. Interesting; according to them it is hard to believe in evolution because it is mathematically difficult. However, they forgot to mention that it is credible to believe in a god without any remote mathematical chance to probe its existence.

5.- They explain how perfect and wonderful life is and that could not do this perfection.  They forgot to explain the imperfections and/or limitations of nature (cancer, shortcomings of the body, etc). If the give a god the credits for the perfection of nature, then why did they not blame their god for the imperfections?
