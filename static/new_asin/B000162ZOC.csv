8007180,5,B000162ZOC,"I study Aikido-Jujitsu, and have studied other arts before including Karate, ect.  This DVD is worth your time and money, and this instructor is very good at explaining each technique as it applies to modern street self defense.  Learning both knife and gun defense is essential to any modern Martial Arts practitioner who wants to survive if and when an attack occurs.  I noticed clearly this instructor had incorporated other systems into each self defense technique, where the attacker engages the defending victim from different angles and different types of mugs.  He also explains the importance of legal issues involving self defense, where you the victim cannot become an attacker on your own if you successfully stop the mug, and then all of a sudden attack out of some need for revenge against the assailant.  You have to be in self control at all times, and that is explained clearly in this DVD in a very professional manner, unlike other Martial Arts videos where they take a fantasy Hollywood approach.  Very enjoyable to watch.",1395273600,3,1042,4.959770114942529
8007181,5,B000162ZOC,this volume involves techniques club knife and hand gun disarming this I would recommend to higher belts seeing your mind plays tricks on you when someone pulls a weapon out on you.,1388620800,,181,4.6875
8007182,5,B000162ZOC,"This Volume is simply a MUST-Have for all Aikidoka, as well as anybody who wants to learn how to defend themself against REAL SITUATIONS of danger that happen everyday out on the streets.  So if you don't buy the other ones, at least get this one.  Volume 3 focuses on Handgun, Knife and Club Disarming Techniques. So this one is definitely worth the price tag, IMO.

I have already whined over and over again about how short these videos are, even though Sensei Dye does a great job of providing just enough info and techniques for the amount of time on this DVD, LOL. I own ALL three of ""The Aikido Self Defense for the Modern Warrior"" series, and I really enjoy them. A half an hour is just not long enough!!  I normally wouldn't buy ANY one of these DVDs cause I'm just cheap like that, lol -- but I just love, love, love this MA so much!!  Plus, this one's just vital to my collection. :)

Excerpt From Vol. 1 Review:

I'll eventually be signing up for Aikido classes, but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't learn a thing or two while watching this video. Practicing this stuff, is a good thing to get you ready for the dojo, so you'll at least know a little bit about what they are talking about and referring to. Especially if you don't know any even basic Japanese--which I do know a little bit. These DVDs are a great little tool to warm you up, get you going in the right direction... and finally, get ready for the mat. Veteran Aikidokas might really enjoy them, too, anything to help one to polish and perfect their craft.  That's just my personal opinion, though, so take it how you wish.

Anywho... like I said... these DVDs are pretty good and informative, but just so expensive and TOO DARN SHORT!!! It makes me hunger for more, more, more!! Which I'm sure that's exactly what these guys want if they continue to put more volumes out on DVD. This one came out a few years go, so these may be the only three they decide to put out. So........ until I can get to the dojo--being such a busy gal and all--these will remain my guides. I may need to spend a lttle bit more time on youtube, and read, read, read as well LOL!  But soon... it will be time to for me to 'put the belt on.' ;)

Conclusion:

So once again, even if you choose not to buy the first two volumes at all, I'd at least put a little investment on this volume, definitely.  It might save your life.",1283385600,2,2389,4.256637168141593
8007183,5,B000162ZOC,"I found this 3 set video to be very concise in the presentation of the maneuvers presented
I have seen about 100 Aikido instructional videos, and would rate this above average
The footwork is very clearly viewable",1274054400,,213,4.783783783783784
8007184,4,B000162ZOC,"As a whole set it's good.  The instructions are very good and you feel like the teacher is right there with you.  There is just the disappointments of having the same introduction in all three volumes that take up ten minutes and another ten minutes at the end with the same set of advertisements.  This leaves only 30 minutes on average for instructions.  I wish I could have purchased it at a lower price, but now that I have the set, I will keep it.  It may be worth it.  It's good to have a little extra instruction, but it's nothing compared to going to the dojo.",1169856000,15,568,4.261682242990654
8007185,4,B000162ZOC,"Don't want to sound like a broken record if you read my first two reviews.  But this is a great instructional video. It's like having the instructor in your house, but nothing like going to the mat yourself and learning hands on. Another ten minutes introduction with basic instruction of break falls and rolls, same as the first two. The big improvement is the 40 minutes of instructions against weapons. This is how a good martial art instruction video ought to be.  Hmmm... How to put it in words...  I don't like gun defenses.  They tend to be unrealistic.  Just not safe nor smart, but then it's your life on the line.  My best advice is to give them your money or car keys... you can replace those, not your life.  More ten minutes of advertisements.  This video may be worth the $30.",1169683200,3,790,4.475524475524476
8007186,5,B000162ZOC,"The quality of all three Videos are outstanding. I have learned so much that can be used for today's self-defense.

The techniques here are awesome.",1169683200,2,148,4.92
