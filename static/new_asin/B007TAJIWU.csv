8521733,5,B007TAJIWU,"The vintage film clips of the original 32 Ford being built and tested combined with the clips of hot rodding on the dry lakes and other venues makes this DVD a keeper.
You will watch this many times and catch new insight every time.",1357430400,,232,4.295454545454546
8521734,5,B007TAJIWU,"This is a well-produced documentary of America's most legendary and iconic car.  The historic footage of lake bed racing from the 40's is incredible!!  They do a great job of telling the history behind the creation of the '32 ford, as well as how it evolved and ""Hot Rodding"" was born.  The interviews with some of the hot rod era's founding fathers is so amazing to watch, and it's a great piece of history to own.  I would recommend this documentary to ANY hot rod enthusiast!",1338076800,,478,4.523255813953488
