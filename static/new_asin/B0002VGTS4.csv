2126863,3,B0002VGTS4,"IT  WAS  OK,  I  JUST  EXPECTED  THAT  IT  WOULD  HAVE SHOWN  MORE  OF  HIS  TOUR IN THE  PACIFIC  THEATRE.
MY  BROTHER  WAS IN  WW11,  AND  WAS IN THE 77th  INFANTRY  DIVISION  AND WAS  WITH  ERNIE PYLE  WHEN  HE  WAS SHOT  BY THE JAPS.  HE  SAID THAT  THE  JAPS ,  WHEN THEY  KILLED  EARNIE ,  KNEW  WHO  HE WAS.",1366502400,5,314,3.7586206896551726
2126864,5,B0002VGTS4,He really enjoyed it. He has watched more than once already.  Ernie Pyle is one of his heroes.  He met a retired chaplain once who knew Pyle.,1356998400,,141,4.185185185185185
2126865,5,B0002VGTS4,"This is an excellent presentation of Ernie Pyle's work in World War II. His words are read by the narrator with the full impact of the meaning Pyle must have intended. Many of the pictures from this war are included and are disturbing. However, they are included to help the viewer understand what Pyle saw on the front lines which motivated his writing.",1324512000,6,354,4.634920634920635
2126866,5,B0002VGTS4,"I was expecting a 70 minute biographical sketch on Ernie Pyle, and wouldn't have been disappioned at all.  Instead, I got what made him tick, along with insight from other WWII correspondents, & those who served in the war.  This is a terrific tribute to anyone who served in the war, and I cannot state enough how highly I recommend it.",1132963200,18,337,4.508196721311475

2126909,5,B0002VGTS4,"A documentary worthy of the man.  Told mostly through the words of his articles and combat photos, you get a portrait of the journalist who came to be loved by the fighting men and admired by his colleagues.  I highly recommend the movie ""The Story of G.I. Joe,"" if you're not into documentaries.",1490054400,,296,4.566037735849057

2126914,5,B0002VGTS4,This is one of the best videos about some of the history of WWII. It is an inspiring story about one of the best war reporters there ever have been.

2126917,4,B0002VGTS4,"Bottom Line First:
G I Joe, The Ernie Pyle story is an almost stodgy summary of the wartime portion of Ernie Pyle's life. It is built around several of his best war time columns and between them and the narration, a viewer gains a better than basic appreciation for a man who told the story of the America's soldiers such that G Is recognized themselves. Back home their families would better accept the absence of sons and brothers, knowing that their fighting was respected and worthy. Much is missing from this Bio, but it strength is that it remains true to Ernie Pyle.

X--X--X--X--X--X--X

G. I Joe opens with a piece Pyle wrote in 1943. Ernie had previously embedded himself with front line Army Units in North Africa, and was back following some of the worst of the European Theater fighting in the Mountains of Italy. In this column he detailed the events around the evacuating of the body of Army Captain Waskow. We are told that he was popular with his troops and generally respected. The scene as he his body is returned from where he had fallen to a collection point for casualties is described with simple honesty. Ernie was beginning to understand that in war, the dead tend to be uncounted and unnoticed. Capt. Waskow was different; especially to his men. Yet once those few made their individual peace with his corpse, those back at the collection point return to the relative comforts of their cow shed.
Later we will hear his columns about the horrible but beautiful fires as London is bombed, and again of the simple facts of lined up dead; their scattered personal effects and the matter of fact wreckage of the Normandy Invasion.
In each essay Pyle avoids the cliche, disdained the dramatic and insisted on explain exactly what he was seeing. He is loyal to the soldier. He identifies most closely with the man doing the fighting. While acknowledging that the war fighting sailor and airman is close to death, neither has to live in the continuous privation and immediacy of the front line soldier.

What is in this documentary works. The visuals help the viewer to appreciate the reality that Ernie Pyle was attempting to give to the folks at home. While there are statements made by a variety of famous reported who also covered WWII; it is clear that Walter Cronkite, Andy Rooney and Charles Kuralt did not spend as much time as close to the front as Pyle did and did not know him any better than the soldiers.
What is missing is the background that explains that Ernie Pyle had been covering typical America for years before the war. His home spun style was not an affectation but a long practiced extension of his career as a reporter. Absent is his low opinion of Gen. Patton. Not explored is the on-coming failure of his marriage, coming apart in part due to her mental issues and his battlefield exhaustion.

It is not that J I Joe is too simple or that there was more to him than his wartime columns, it is the fact that his story cannot be told given the limitations of a short documentary. As such The Ernie Pyle Story is more like a highlight reel that captures what made him famous but cannot explain where he came from as a reporter and what other aspects made up his life.",1441756800,9,3209,4.585365853658536

8033208,5,B0002VGTS4,"Ernie Pyle's writings are good in this DVD, but better by reading his dispatches in print, which were sent home for newspapers, providing the best understanding of WW II.  Here's a favorite book of Pyle's actual writings, which I just discovered on Amazon:
