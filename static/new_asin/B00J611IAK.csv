6338081,5,B00J611IAK,"One of the greatest pop culture rips of all time.  Not appropriate for kids but very funny while blasting standard ""plot"" elements still being photocopied by shows today.  Very silly & very good.  IMHO.",1437350400,3,202,4.882352941176471
6338082,5,B00J611IAK,"Danger 5 is a TV show that isn't even pretending to be realistic and is done in the style of old TV shows like Thunderbirds, Batman, Get Smart and even 80's cartoons where a group of heroes made of the best of the best military agents from all over the allied world, who save the world and return to their base each week. Even movies like James Bond are payed homage to. It's set during World War II, with the mission given by their boss, a giant eagle each week, to tackle the latest super villain type scheme the Germans have come up with.  Toy ships, submarines, trucks are used instead of real vehicles, there's even giant plastic dinosaurs (or humans wearing dinosaur heads) in the second episode.  The group's in the field leader Claire from the UK, is seen as the hottest woman the Germans and other enemies have ever seen, which leads to some jealousy and resentment by the darker haired girl Ilsa (the Russian) and other women who join the group each episode.  Amongst the three guys you have an American, Australian and Pierre who is classified as European, but probably French.  Besides destroying the plans of the Nazis, there objective each episode is to also kill Hitler, who miraculously cartoon super villain style each week escapes death by jumping through a window.

This Australian show is a lot of fun, it's intentionally corny, dogs speak (sometimes they and the humans speak German and there's subtitles), there's giant monsters (paying homage to Godzilla and the other attack of the giant whatever films), a Planet of the Apes style community that doesn't live in harmony with an Amazonian woman type ancient tribe where a German scientist holds Gladiatorial death matches, the Lost City of Atlantis is in one episode and many more myths and legends of the past.",1435968000,10,1785,4.745161290322581

8648521,5,B00J611IAK,Fell in love with this show when it was on Netflix briefly. Great spy parody. It plays on xbox 1 & PS4 with English subs when English is not being spoken. Though I will be getting season 2 from the German Amazon it's under $20 total there. wish I had done that for season 1. wasted $30.,1529625600,,286,4.035087719298246
8648522,5,B00J611IAK,"This DVD is region 0 and works in my PS4 just fine.

If you enjoyed this series on netflix and are worried about the language issues noted in other reviews, fear not.  Ilsa still speaks Russian and Hitler and some nazis still speak German.  English subtitles are available when there is non-english dialogue  and the rest of the dialogue is in English.  Absolutely love this series.",1527120000,,382,4.7272727272727275
8648523,3,B00J611IAK,This version is not in English. Part of it is not. Certain dialogue is in German. Not the full experience.,1524873600,,106,4.35

8648525,4,B00J611IAK,It's everything it says it is and it is in German subtitles making it pretty much unwatchable unless you can read conversational German for all the foreign parts,1512518400,,161,4.785714285714286
8648526,5,B00J611IAK,I was initially worried that this DVD wouldn't be compatible with my DVD player or that I wouldn't be able to switch the audio to English. Luckily neither turned out to be an issue but the seller made it very easy to return if there was a problem. The shipping even took less time than expected. I'm very happy with this purchase.,1493251200,4,330,4.338709677419355
