Takin' it upside the head is Martin Landau as the Mob boss, doing a lot with a relatively small role. The soundtrack is real fine, especially the chase scene at the horsetrack.

1958646,2,B0000WN154,"Jim Brown has plenty of cool to spare in this blaxploitation throwaway. ""Black Gunn"" (1972) is worth a look for its eclectic cast (check out Luciana Paluzzi, Bruce Glover, Keefe Brasselle and a sadly underutilized Martin Landau), but don't expect any surprises. Better-than-average production values make for a passable time-filler.",1446163200,,332,5.66

As classic blaxploitation, Black Gunn is an action film with a predominantly black cast: validation that basic urban storylines can be told regardless of color. Unfortunately and like so many other examples of the genre, Black Gunn is let down by ketchup packet special effects. Jim Brown looks slightly ridiculous (who wouldn't?) driving a white Rolls-Royce throughout the film, especially in the chase scene.

As well, Black Gunn is not particularly edgy. The counter-racism is prevalent, but most of the anti-black racism is saved for attempts at humor. A minor character (baseball player Vida Blue in a cameo) is threatened with a trip to ""that great watermelon patch in the sky.""

Bruce Glover (Crispin's dad) is sinister here as head goon Kriley. However, Martin Landau is oddly cast here and in any case not very good. Perhaps the biggest dealbreaker is the disappointing soundtrack.

1958648,4,B0000WN154,A movie with a topic that is as relevant today as it was when it was filmed.,1420156800,,76,3.5294117647058822
1958649,2,B0000WN154,"Utterly dull blacksploitation that consists of a series of scenes that are boring and hysterically anti-white.  The anti-honky messages are part of the game, but they don't add up at all, and they get tedious after the first clich of ""whites roughing up the blacks"".  There's some 70's music and a few low-budget gun fights but it lacks any story or sense of urgency.

Features a few actors who are recognizable.  Martin Landau as Capelli, Stephen McNally as Laurento, Bernie Casey as Seth, Gary Conway as Adams, Bruce Glover as Ray Kriley and Jim Brown as Gunn.",1403740800,2,562,4.762886597938144

1958652,4,B0000WN154,"I have recently developed an appeciation for low budget British filmmaker Robert Hartford-Davis (1923-1977) after watching a handful of his horror films such as BLACK TORMENT (1965), CORRUPTION (1968), and THE FIEND aka BEWARE THE BRETHREN (1972). The constant thread running through these and such films as BLACK GUNN (1973) are imaginative camerawork, crisp but non-flashy editing, and consistently interesting performances from his actors. In that sense Hartford-Davis is sort of a poor man's Michael Winner (literally since he never had the budgets Winner did for his films) which is meant as a compliment. I have a strong admiration for directors like Edgar G. Ulmer, Edward L. Cahn, and now Hartford-Davis who could create numerous memorable moments out of the small budgets that they had to work with. Small budgets also meant that they were stuck in genre films like horror or exploitation (Blaxploitation in this case) but even in this category the cream always manages to rise to the top.

Despite the title, BLACK GUNN is not a remake of the old TV series PETER GUNN refitted for an African-American audience. It's an urban crime melodrama set in L.A. with Jim Brown as the successful owner of a night club whose younger brother rips off the mob. We all know happens when you do that. Throw in some black militancy, some deliberately provocative racist dialogue, a delightfully droll performance by Martin Landau as the chief baddie, and B movie veterans Bruce Glover and William Campbell as a pair of deliriously sleazy hoods and you've got classic entertainment early 70s style (I'm sure Quentin Tarantino knows this particular movie). It's all directed with a quiet panache by Hartford-Davis who had just come to America and would make one more feature before going into television and dying of a heart attack at 53. Is it a great movie? Of course not but within the limited parameters it has to contend with, BLACK GUNN is one of the best of the many blaxploitation movies that were made at this time. I thoroughly enjoyed it and Robert Hartford-Davis is the reason why.",1384819200,,2085,4.974212034383954
