3725689,2,B001O0Z83E,"What we're given in this trying-to-be trendy film is a ""frat-pack"" of college friends, now approaching age 30 (which we all know, of course, their generation thinks of as the ""new 20""). Consisting of four guys and a gal, we have thrust at us the following types: seemingly ""unemployeds"" and frequent drug users, along with one individual who is job successful and one who is trying-to-be. They are all, in their own way, drifting while trying to find both a future and emotional happiness. With one, possibly two exceptions, these are people this reviewer would definitely never care to come close to modeling myself after. There is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives. Except in the instance of one individual (who appears on the way to finding it), none appears headed toward emotional satisfaction in his/her life. And so, about the only sincere moment in this film is when a knock at the door brings to the person answering it an unexpected and heartfelt ""I love you.""

With only the exceptions mentioned, these people are the kind hardly deserving or worthy of several hundred thousands of dollars being thrown away in presenting their stories.

PS--Writer/director, Johnson, definitely appears to have a problem with showing gay sexual scenes----with no such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexual ones. Why might that be?

3725698,3,B001O0Z83E,"The characters don't really evolve nor are most of them all that likeable--but only one gets interesting as almost superfluously villainous.  ""Life stuff"" just happens to them--just as we expect from the start and they react... just as we expected from the start.  If great films are 3D chess, then this is checkers.  The clear intent was to follow the changing relationships between an initially close knit bunch of friends.  However, the knitting here, in what is really just proximate vignettes with occasional cross-weaving, lacks convincing entailment.  The actors do well, however, despite the trite shallowness of the script visited upon them.",1378512000,,650,5.333333333333333
3725699,1,B001O0Z83E,"I need to say something right up front here, because it's relevant to my review/opinion: Whenever I go to see something--be it a movie, play, opera, concert, ballet, whatever--I go fully expecting to like it, and that I'm going to enjoy myself. The same applies to books and stories. I am not without critical faculties. But I am usually willing to put up with a great deal if, overall, my response is positive and favorable. And that's because of two lessons learned years ago now that have stayed with me ever since:  One day, when we were both in our neighborhood movie rental shop, an older woman, overhearing that I had just seen a certain film, asked me what I thought of it. So I told her, adding in truth, ""But it's flawed."" Whereupon she said to me rather wryly, ""All movies are flawed.""

And she was right.  Because there really is no such thing, not in the entire century plus of cinema, as a perfect film.

The second lesson came from my coach the day before I was to sing my first major Wagnerian rle after a year of six two hour sessions a week with her, and another 14 hours a week at home--and I was still terrified:  ""Just stop it,"" said she; ""and try to relax. You're going to make mistakes. It can't be avoided. Because you're human.""

And that is why now, in my age, I just get irritated by friends and/or reviewers who knock a film because of the very pickiest of minutiae, because we do indeed need to keep human frailty in mind. For instance, the first scene of the coda of Arizona Sky is frankly godawful. Jayme McCabe and Emerson Smith do a really admirable job with what they've got, but it is truly a dreadful piece of writing and direction; nevertheless I was so charmed by the film as a whole, I bought it.

I have no idea what the motivation might be for that kind of sniping and snipping except maybe to try to impress us with how knowledgeable he/she is,  when, in fact, such picayune nit picking--and then adducing those pickings as reason sufficient to condemn--is usually a clear sign that, fundamentally, such folks don't really know what the hell they're talking about: I have one acquaintance who fancied he was being oh-so-terribly-soign when he airily opined that Sir Colin Davis doesn't understand Mozart! Sir Colin Davis!  When, as it turned out under questioning, he just didn't like the tempi Sir Colin took in the Covent Garden Zauberflte.

Okay. Having I hope made it clear that I'm an easy-going sort of audience, I now have to say this:  I absolutely hated just about every single aspect of The New Twenty. I am not going to summarize the plot; others have already done an admirable job of that; in fact, it was from the previous reviews here at Amazon that I drew the conclusion that this film was unlikely to be my cup of tea. But a friend who had seen it said he would like to have it. So I got it for him.

He then insisted I see it even though I tried to demur.  I never thought that ninety minutes could last so long. . . .

On a purely technical level - acting (for the most part), mis-en-scne, photography, set design - it really can't be faulted. Although I do have a quibble about the DVD transfer; or possibly about film actors who haven't got a clue how to speak clearly and/or project.  Whatever the problem, the dialogue, spare and inane as it is, is all too often muddied to the point of incomprehensibility; in sheer frustration, after fifteen minutes I turned on the closed captioning. Not that it helped any.

Because I think the writing of this film was really, really bad, often making no sense at all. To me. Perhaps if I were younger and one of the perpetually adolescent sort of yuppie depicted I'd feel differently. I don't know.

The director also wrote and produced - at best a dangerous thing to do because in any art but especially in a collective one like film, colossal egos notwithstanding, the third eye - or ear - is a vital, indeed critical tool, and it was patently left unused here. Of course I've suspected for some time that that's a danger peculiar to and inherent in the nature of Indies - which, nevertheless, are the only films I currently rent or own.

I also found this film to be seriously dishonest. Even offensive. It was marketed, at least to some degree, as a gay flick. And I'm still wondering why. Was the writer/producer/director attracted like a moth to a flame by the reputed big bucks the gay community spends on entertainment? Somebody should have told him that, a few years back, several big publishing houses were reduced to a palpitating jelly over the prospect of a vast new monied market, and rushed all kinds of crap into print - only to discover that the gay market, for jolly good historical reasons, is uniquely sensitive to patronizing. And pandering.

Furthermore, and I may well be wrong here, but I've begun just lately to feel that having straight men playing gay men is the moral equivalent of white men in black face. Okay, sometimes they do a good job. Brendan Bradley in Redwoods is wonderful; so is Dan Payne in Mulligans.  But we've also had the disedifying spectacle of Tom Hanks refusing to kiss Anthony Banderas in Philadelphia (and getting reamed out by a disgusted Banderas, I'm given to understand), or Will Smith ditto in Six Degrees of Separation.  Or perhaps worst of all Steve Waddington in Derek Jarman's version of Kit Marlowe's Edward II who looks as if he wants to squeal in horror and squirm his way off the set every time Piers Gaveston shows up!  But I digress. . . .

Here we get wallow after wallow in the bedsteads of the straight characters, but when it comes to the gay relationships - or perhaps activities were the better word - the reticence and lack of ease on the part of both director and at least one of the actors involved is palpable. Is the director/writer/producer straight and doesn't really understand gay men a la the septic Ang Lee? Or perhaps a homophobic gay man? (And, yes, they do exist.) In fact, I finally began to get really angry, because, as the film progressed, it seemed to me the repellant and homophobic remarks of the Louie character began to seem less like character defining squibs and more and more like those of a kind of Greek chorus offering asides from which the writer/producer/director could distance himself should it prove necessary, but still allow him to snigger into his beer that he'd got away with having someone snidely denigrating Tony and the other gay characters with the usual jock disdain. So over the top, in fact, I kept expecting Louie to try to jump Andrew's bones! At least that would have been psychologically sound.

I have heard this film called an ensemble piece. But it is no such thing - probably through no fault of the actors; they were just doing the best they could with the piss-poor material they had to work with - because virtually all the characters as drawn are a mere minor second down from full-blown sociopaths; communication, where it exists at all, is a mere simulacrum; and every one `em clearly believes solely in the reality of him- or herself alone.

Finally, and actually of far more importance than just about any of the above, there lies the question:  Why in the name of all that is holy would any real adult be in the least interested in any of these characters? There isn't a one of `em who isn't a jejune, selfish, inarticulate, and narcissistic brat. I live in the North Beach area of San Francisco and have to deal with creatures like this all day every day, and their incredibly bad manners. Do I really need--does anyone really need to see a film about them in all their shallow perversity? Or is the writer/producer/director a devotee of Stanley Kubrik-style adolescent nihilism so that, with wrist glued to forehead like some nineteenth century romantic, he fancies this a story all of us good old boys oinking around out here in the hinterland just had to see? He even has the characters briefly talk about Full Metal Jacket.  Thanks.  But if I want that kind of rubbish, I'll look up Keats or Shelley, E.T.A. Hoffmann or Heinrich Heine, or even Herman Hesse where at least I'll get good language along with the sniveling melancholia and post-pubescent angst. . . .

I don't know.  And I don't care.  To my mind, this film is just a nasty piece of work - and I am cheerfully giving it right back to the fellow for whom I got it with firm instructions to keep it.",1338249600,4,8403,4.541363335539378
3725700,1,B001O0Z83E,"There's not a single believable character, not a single believable scene in this movie. The tone is relentlessly melodramatic, as if these phony characters live right at the edge of hysteria every second of their lives. Everyone is always angry, and nearly every line is either shouted or snarled. That people who so annoy and irritate each other would have remained friends for a decade or even a year is ridiculous. Watching this foolish movie is tiring and tiresome.",1335916800,4,469,4.949367088607595

Well, it doesn't :(
The plot is average. The director apparently was too afraid to present the whole spectrum of gay relationship including sexlife (although, he shot several scenes of straight sex...).
Are the characters likeable? To some degree. Unfortunately, I couldn't neither associate myself with any of 'em nor I give a damn about their problems.
And the cover! Was it supposed to be a candy for gay viewers? Don't let them trick you.

3725702,5,B001O0Z83E,"Very good movie! Much more sophisticated and nuanced than you might think from the cover art. It's not a ""gay movie"" at all, in fact, in the niche sense; it simply has a couple gay characters in it. It's a group friends movie (St. Elmo's Fire, The Big Chill, Diner, etc.) - which is a subgenre I enjoy - and what's nice about THE NEW TWENTY in terms of that is the ending. Won't give it away - just will say that it's not the usual cringe-worthy happily-ever-after thing - ""we'll all be friends forever"" - but something much smarter and more complex. And there's actually a sense of SOCIAL REALITY in the movie that's believable and true. Also really enjoyed depiction of gay and straight male friends that was simply presented as: NOT A BIG DEAL. Like it is in life. ALL the acting is really excellent. I don't know these actors except the guy from the Hal Hartley movies (Bill Sage) - but they all do a great job. Lots of subtle, quiet moments where you really get a feel for the characters and their inner lives. And all-in-all there's a nice pace to it also. It has a dynamic, entertaining feel. A very good American indie that's much smarter and more stylish than the usual!",1271116800,3,1179,4.412844036697248

Seven years after graduation, five buddies from college - four men and a woman, all living in New York City - face the grim prospect of turning thirty.  Andrew (Ryan Locke) is an investment banker who's just gotten engaged to his long time girlfriend, Julie (Nicole Bilderback), who works for a rival firm (he's Morgan, she's Merrill); Felix (Thomas Sadoski) is a drug addict who`s struggling to hide his condition from his friends as well as maintain a relationship with a fellow user; Ben (Colin Fickes) is an unattractive, overweight gay man who can't get anyone to go out with him; and Tony (Andrew Wei Lin) is an attractive, fit gay man who falls for a college professor with HIV.  All five have reached that critical point where's it's time to start taking stock of their lives - to find out where they are and, more importantly, where they're headed.

""The New Twenty"" is the debut feature for writer/director Chris Mason Johnson and, while the hand of the novice is evident in certain aspects of the movie, Johnson also reveals some real potential as a filmmaker.  The relationships among the various characters are, for the most part, unusual and interesting, regardless of whether they are personal or business-related in nature.  The storytelling can be a bit choppy at times and the acting occasionally uneven, but there are enough moments of genuine insight and emotional force to make the movie worth checking out.  The fact that it feels more like a still-rough-around-the-edges first draft than a fully polished and completed work in its own right is actually what gives the movie its greatest authenticity and appeal.",1267920000,2,1642,4.927536231884058

3725706,4,B001O0Z83E,"Looking in on a group of close friends since college, seven years after graduation, things aren't quite what they expected, even considering thirty is ""The New Twenty"" (2009).

There's the ""jock"" of the group, Andrew (hunky former model Ryan Locke), who is looking for financing for an internet startup he believes will make him rich.  He's engaged to Asian-American Julie (Nicole Bilderback, who deserves the critical kudos she got for this role), who finds herself in the uncomfortable position of having to downplay the fact that she makes more money than her fiance'.  Julie's brother, advertising whiz-kid Tony (Andrew Wei Lin) is gay and dating an older man who is HIV+.  In college, Felix (Thomas Sadoski) seemed most likely to succeed, but his inability to give up his drug use have turned him into an insecure addict.  Then there's the resident slacker, Ben (Colin Fickes), the other gay character, who wastes his days searching for online hookups and watching old TV shows.

The dynamics of the relationships between the five friends changes significantly, when Louie (Tony Serpico, a regular on ""Army Wives""), a man in his 40's whom Andrew meets playing cricket, enters into a business arrangement with Andrew, as well as a flirtation with Julie, with the other friends tagging along as they socialize.  This comes to a head at Andrew's bachelor bash, resulting in new resolutions by all, in order to get on with their lives.

A well-written, acted and directed film, and I love the way the gay and straight characters mesh comfortably.  However, I thought it to be a bit predictable in parts, and somewhat negative in that it concentrated on everyone's failures.
