8260943,5,B0016586PY,"What if someone gave you a million dollars? Would you be happy?

This is a wonderfully warm and human movie that asks that very question. Charles Coburn plays a millionaire who decides to give a family a huge sum of money. Many years ago, he was in love with their grandmother, who turned his marriage proposal down. He still loves her, though she's now deceased.

Douglas Sirk does an excellent job showing small-town America and the different classes. The country club clique doesn't fare well as we see snobbery and greed and gossip. We also see a mean drug store owner, so we don't get the notion that only the rich have bad qualities. And, the mother turns especially ugly as she's given her dream of wealth.

Charles Coburn steals the show; he's delightful, eccentric, a skinflint, a great poker player, and an astute observer of human nature. I had to laugh when he was arrested twice. I loved seeing his friendship with the youngest daughter, Roberta. They have great chemistry. There's also a nice dog named Penny to round out their relationship. Finally, look for a young Rock Hudson, who plays a soda jerk in love with the older daughter.

One final note is that I loved seeing the old town library. My library used to be like that when I was a child, but it was renovated and expanded to look like a corporate office building.",1492041600,,1338,4.609243697478991
