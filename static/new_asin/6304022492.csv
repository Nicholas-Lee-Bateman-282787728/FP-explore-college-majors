He exhibits such a  commanding presence that you  just can't take your eyes off him.  From the moment he enters the stage his  energy draws you into the joy of the dance, and the ease with which he does  the most difficult choreography will amaze you.

What had been the holdup? My guess (and it's ONLY a guess) is Michael Flatley. He probably wants more money than he is being offered in order for this to be available on DVD. My ONLY complaint is there is TOO much vocalizing. I would have liked MORE dancing, & less singing.

Since no DVD version was made of this performance in Dublin, I am very careful with my copy since it is fragile.  We watch it every St. Patrick day.  Katie McMahan is also very good.

So here it is, almost St. Patrick's Day when all things Irish are celebrated (or supposed to be celebrated... don't even get me started on the obsession with green beer!) and I wanted to celebrate at home with my 5 year old and 2 year old by watching this. I thought to myself, ""Surely I can stream Riverdance on Amazon or a competing streaming service..."" only to find that I CAN'T. How has this treasure been allowed to get lost in the vaults of VHS formatting and please-be-kind-rewind-land? It's a travesty, I tell you!!!

780206,5,6304022492,"Feb. 2, 2015: A great dance show.  Flatley has a lot of action and flair in his performances--sometimes a little over-the-top, but that's who he seems to be/have been as a performer.  The other dancers (including Jean Butler) and the musicians are incredible.  Have enjoyed watching this many times since being given this tape as an older child.  I love this show, but would love even more to have it on DVD to go with all the other Riverdance shows that I own.  It's quite an unpleasant gap to not have the original show available in a format that people can use in today's high-tech world, especially since several of the dances from this show were included in the ""Best of Riverdance"" DVD that was released some years ago.  If those dances were digitized for that compilation release, then were the rest of them also converted?  (If not, it would beg the question 'why not?').

Update Feb. 4, 2015:  I decided after posting my original review to try to contact Riverdance and see what they might say about the lack of a DVD format for this show. I figured ""What the heck"", even though another reviewer here had done the same thing 4-5 years ago and gotten a ""no go"" response.  Well, I did get a reply back this morning and...fingers crossed, but we may have reason to hope.  The respondent to my email said that it actually is something they are currently working on, and to stay tuned for a possible announcement.  Maybe they've gotten enough customer feedback over the years to realize that DVD/Blu-Ray availability is something that people really want, or maybe they were just waiting for this year's 20th anniversary to arrive to do something really special with the original show.  Whatever it is, I won't argue, especially if we end up getting this show re-released.

Update November 8, 2016: Well, unfortunately my optimism last year ended up being misplaced.  Despite the encouraging words from the show rep who responded to my email nearly 2 years ago now, the rest of 2015 and now almost all of 2016 have passed without any signs of a DVD release of the original Riverdance show.  And my attempt a while back to email that rep again to ask about the status of things went unanswered.  And while a 20th anniversary disc (""Riverdance 20"") was released--through the show's website, but not here on Amazon--I never saw much information on what exactly it contained, though from the listed names of the ""stars"" it's clear that it wasn't the hoped-for Micheal/Jean show.  I still can't understand why it can't be released, since the ""Best of Riverdance"" DVD a few years ago proved that at least some of the original show's numbers are in a digital format.",1422835200,,2662,4.700431034482759

780364,5,6304022492,"Michael Flatley is both the choreographer and the STAR of the show.  When Michael Flatley is performing himself, his performance is unique, as is his kinesthetic interpretation of the part. He engages his audience in such a manner that they feel as if they are participants in the play themselves. His exemplary creation as well as his performance is only superceded by each of his own subsequent creations and performances, such as The Lord of the Dance, Feet of Flames, The Celtic Tiger, Michael Flatley Returns as The Lord of The Dance (2011), Michael Flatley gold etc.  I have not seen anyone else with his charisma, and strength of presence on the scene.  The whole family actually clap nonstop when he shows up and performs in the video.  His autobiography, as well as his BEHIND THE SCENES discussions, give a glimpse of the process he has so far gone through in his evolution as a man, as a creator, as a performer, as a teacher, as a learner, and not only.  Of course he is a work in progress and he has a lot more to offer, as he himself discovers his own potential and talents.  I strongly recommend all of his works, including his music.
Riverdance as a whole is a collaborative creation, and great talents as well as great minds came together for this production.  Bill Whelans music is beautiful  and the songs  and musicians were excellent.  Jean Butler is excellent, as is Maria Pages.  The Moiseyev dance company was very lively, entertaining, and made us laugh.  The Harlem Tappers were connecting to the audience and combined skill and unexpected performances that caught the audience by surprise.  James Bignon and The Deliverance Ensemble evoked deep emotions and were very thought provoking through their high quality performance.
However, this show is also not without controversy.  Part 12 is called Macedonia Morning. , which is the source of the controversy depending on whose point of view it expresses.  Of course, there is no better advertisement for a show than controversy, and I want to believe that show promotion and advertising  is the only reason that Part 12 is so named.  On the other hand, theater, in general, is no stranger to politics.",1386547200,,2177,4.809139784946237

Mr. Flatley has such magic in his dancing that no other has! For me, this one ties in times watched with my other Riverdance from New York City with Colin dancing. Both are superb, yet different.

This is the video that really launched Michael Flatley's career, and really change the world of dance forever. This film put Ireland on the map for many people. You could even go as far to say, that it is because of this show, that new tv series like ""so you think you can dance"", have grown to be so popular. Michael Flatley really commercialized dance with this film.

I used to watch this all the time when I was a little kid. I have early memories of me dancing around the house, trying to keep my posture straight, arms to my side.

It's worth putting it over onto DVD if you own a machine that will do that, since the producers don't seem to want to release this on DVD. MF brings an energy and flair to this that can't be matched by other dancers- he created this in the first place and it shows. I live in Seattle and have seen both Jimi Hendrix and Randy Hansen play the same music- both great guitar players but no doubt about who is the creator.

Really it's quite bad.  Not that the dancing isn't phenomenal (Michael rules!), but it lacks soul.  Hubby and I like Celtic music --old ""Shepherd's Hey"" fans-- and we get to see Celtic dancing locally (though amateur) and we both found this video disappointing.

The principal problem is the 'homogenization' of the singing.  It is sort of Celtic music for elevators.  The second problem is the Flamenco dancer.  Having seen a top rank group from Spain at Wolftrap, I have to say that this lady has got no 'attitude' and the music.... please, don't get me started.

This is truly a mesmerizing video, not only because of the spectacular dancing but also because of the inclusion of the diverse cultural and historical facts of Irelands past.
The answer to the diversity of the ""phenomenon"" is found in the history of Western Europe.  When many of the survivors of the wrecks of the Armada ended up on its shores, Ireland came under the influence of the invasion of the Moors in Spain,. Naturally Spanish/Arabic culture became inculcated in the culture fo the country. So now it must be included in the musical heritage of Ireland.
As for the gospel music, the Irish that emigrated to the Eastern United States added their ballads and jigs to country music as well as the Africans that were slaves in those same areas and these two became intertwined.
I found all of the music to be authentic and moving.
I am Italian by heritage, but just for a moment I was envious of all thse who can claim Irish dancing as their own.",1081123200,5,1095,4.475

780723,4,6304022492,"First of all, I must say that I was extremely surprised by ""Riverdance."" I expected a much longer movie, with the focus on Irish dancing/singing alone, not a short show with about half of the dances/performances not even Irish-related.
The aspect of ""Riverdance"" that makes it so special is the almost-magical, awesome dancing. I had never seen Irish step dancing before, and was quickly mesmerized by the dancers' impossibly intricate yet seemingly effortless footwork. Especially notable, of course, were Jean Butler (you can't take your eyes off her when she's doing her solos!) and Michael Flatley, whose sheer energy when dancing is astounding. Not only was the dancing superb, but it was obvious that whoever filmed the movie took great care to include many ""views"" of the dancers' feet-which are the primary focus in Irish step dancing. Finally, unique and beautifully symbolic costumes ensured that the dances were truly unforgettable.
However, despite the fact that the dancing aspect of ""Riverdance"" was unforgettable, other parts of the movie could have used work. I was puzzled that performances such as a Spanish dance and guitar solo, a song by an African-American gospel choir, and an ""Arabian-flavored"" dance were included. I feel that I would not be alone in saying that these numbers didn't seem to ""fit,"" and although some of these ""extras"" were excellently performed, they did not satisfy the watcher's intense desire to delve deeper into Irish dancing. I would be curious to know what the logic behind including such diverse performances was; I was disappointed that this sensation billed as purely Irish was filled with so many other ethnic ""specialties."" I also felt let down when I realized how short the movie was. 72 minutes? I could have watched some more spectacular Irish dancing all night!
After reading all of my complaints, you are probably surprise that I still gave this movie a four-star rating. However, I feel the Irish numbers (both dancing AND singing/instrumental) are so moving, magical, breathtaking, and unique that they make up for many other faults that this movie may have. If you want to see great dancing, go see this movie; if you're looking for something purely Irish, you may want to skip ""Riverdance.""",1036886400,2,2253,5.10840108401084

The story of Riverdance as told by Nightsky Weaverwombon.

They cast their Sacred Circle and raise power with their amazing dancing. Next...Ahhh...The Shining One, My Beloved Lord Lugh, Lord of the Dance, God of Sun/Fire shows His Dazzling Beauty And AWESOME Power. His Preistesses join Him in the dance and they dance in a Creation triangle.

Then Mother Ocean and Mother River sing to us.

Then My Dearly Beloved Lady, Brid, Goddess of Healing, Fire/Sun, poetic inspiration, metalsmithing, protectoress of children, childbirth and animal husbandry, etc...dances with Her handmaids circling 'round Her. She is Beautiful beyond All words. The Great Mother Of All Life!

Next, a Bard graces us with a song that once heard is never to be forgotten.

Then a Goddess of Fire dances her Dance of Fire and The God of Fire joins her and there is Divine Merging!

After that, the Lady and Lord and all their Priestessses and Priests dance and the Goddess sings to us.

Then the Crone Mourns. The Circle is uncast and we are home again.

I have left out all the parts that aren't specifically Celtic. Riverdance was responsible for my finally figuring out what my life-long beliefs meant. I am an out-of-the-broom-closet Wiccan/Witch. I do actually worship Brid and Lugh! I meant all of the things I said literally!

To sum it up: Perfection!

I have left out some of the other Pagan symbolism there is in Riverdance, but suffice it to say that most, if not all, of the forms they make while they're dancing are Pagan as well as the lighting effects. Jean Butler and Michael Flately make the best Brid and Lugh in any of the many of the show's incarnations.

Obviously, I highly reccomend this tape to everyone.",996624000,,1810,4.859934853420196
780829,5,6304022492,"The editor's criticism of Riverdance is meaningless.  Riverdance is truly a phenomenom.  I was so impressed by how moving the dances and music are.  The dancers never waste any time.  They just move from one beautiful move to another.  They have a very good dance cast and on the stage they bring life and motion.  You can't resist the tapping sounds.  The music brings just as much liveliness.  The music cast includes piper Davy Spillane, accordianist Mairtin O'Conner, and fiddler Maire Breatnach(before Eileen Ivers joined the show).  The music is at times slow and moody, but then it goes on to be energetic and jig like.  One of the best parts of the music is the songs.  The choral group Anuna, made up of five men and five women, sings so beautifully in ""The Heart's Cry"", ""The Heartland"", and the song ""Riverdance"".  The American gospel influence of ""Freedom"", performed by the James Bignon group portrays the dreams of freedom shared by America and Ireland.  The finally at the end with Anuna and the African-American group together is so cute!  One cannot ignore the beauty of the song, ""Lift the Wings"", which I believe helped inspire the Titanic theme(you can't resist that lovely low whistle).  All of the music is a great picture of Celtic music, bringing the spirit of the past to our time.  At the same time, it has influence from cultural music of Spain, Russia, and African-American gospel.  It is folly for one to resist this masterpiece.  It is a classic that will last a long time.  Even teenagers like myself adore the soundtrack, but one should also get a hold of the video to see the dances.  The songs and dances often relate to Celtic legends and mythology, such as ""The Countess Kathleen"" and ""Lament For Cu Chuchaillin"".  You can not say no to Davy Spillane's powerful uillean pipes!

Michael Flatley and Jean Butler dancing together was the basic element that held the show together and who the 5 stars are for. Michael Flatley, contrary to popular media opinion, does not have a huge ego. Having met this man twice in 1997, I found him to be gracious, kind, gentle, sincere and soft-spoken, taking time to stop and talk with his fans. Sadly, Mr. Flatley's flute piece, accompanied by bodhran player Tommy Hayes, was cut from the American release, along with a few other things, and a second dance by Ms. Maria Pages. No one can light up the stage and transform such energy to an audience like Mr. Flatley, no matter what the critics say. He is the best of the best in modern Irish dance, period, no matter if you like him or not. Be sure to watch for a new upcoming show from him, in the near future! He never stops creating.",976924800,8,963,4.446327683615819
780831,5,6304022492,"I've seen both versions of ""Riverdance,"" with and without Michael Flatley, and I think this one is far and away the better.  His successor is a terrific dancer, in a rather self-contained style, but he  lacks Flatley's gusto and his rapport with the other dancers and the  audience (compare the duos with Jean Butler in both versions and you'll see  what I mean).  Flatley always looks as if he's enjoying himself, and he  throws himself into every performance with passion and enthusiasm -- even  after many hundreds of shows, it's not ""just a job"" to him!  Ms.  Butler is superb:  she can be light as thistledown, or stomp out an  intricate rhythm in tap shoes with the best of them.
As for the rest of  the film, I could have done with fewer choral selections, although both  Anuna and the Gospel group perform well.  I would have liked to see more of  the band:  as an Irish music aficionado, I was stunned to read the credits  and see the caliber of musicians who'd been performing, but the tape didn't  give more than the odd 10 seconds to anyone besides Davy Spillane.  And I  can't imagine why the filmmakers didn't include the tap dance segment,  which was, to me, the best part of the New York tape.
But this version  has it all over the other in one very important respect:  whoever filmed it  understood something about Irish dancing.  They focused on the footwork,  which, to a fan of this dance style, is THE most interesting part.  The  show was a gigantic hit in Ireland -- and in the heavily Irish communities  in the U.S. -- in large part because it took a traditional (sometimes  hackneyed) ethnic dance form and turned it on its ear.  If it's filmed as  just another razzle-dazzle dance show, with no attention to its roots, much  of the enjoyment goes out of it -- and I think that happened in the New  York version.",962064000,70,1837,4.5

Colin Dunn may be a skilled performer, but no amount of championship titles  can make up for the fact he lacks Flatley's presence and command of the  audience. This production of Riverdance is the only one you need - forget  Riverdance: The journey and the Radio City Music hall nightmare. This is  Riverdance the way it was meant to be, before the producers drove Flatley  away and stole his creation. The can claim credit all they wish, but  Michael Flatley proved where the true passion for the dance went when he  bravely formed his own production of Lord of the Dance and later, Feet of  Flames.  The current Broadway Riverdance show is fine for making the  producers money and appeasing the tourists, but they cannot deny the  passion and fire of the original is gone.  The only thing worth watching  the Broadway cast for is the added solos of Maria Pages and the newer  modern tap routines. But there is no beating the original production, with  it's passion and fire that truly embody the spirit of the Celts.
