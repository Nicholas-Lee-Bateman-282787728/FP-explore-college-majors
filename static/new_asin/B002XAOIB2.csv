8383554,4,B002XAOIB2,"I saw this series years ago and remembered that I enjoyed it, so when I saw that I could get the original series on DVD I jumped at the chance.  Well, I enjoyed it this time also - I will admit that it was dated as to the fashions, etc, but if you can get past that it is a good story and didn't lose much over the years.",1404950400,,321,3.652173913043478
8383555,5,B002XAOIB2,"It was just as I expected. To start off it was a bit confusing when the first chapter ended, I thought the whole dvd was complete but no there were more (that is the only downside for me but not for any genius). Picture and sound quality were good.

I first watched it when I was younger and to have a copy of that now is just superb. I have watched it twice already. Great story.",1398729600,,380,4.0
8383556,5,B002XAOIB2,Good miniseries without the commercials; good story and acting.  Getting ready to watch the sequel.  Enough suspense to keep one interested,1332892800,,139,5.571428571428571
