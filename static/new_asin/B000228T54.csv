As we've moved along the start has shifted from episodic moments of heroism to an increasingly focused story of the participants in a struggle that will determine the shape of the celestial world.  Homura has become the real opponent, determined to recreate the universe.  At the center of the reasons for this battle is Prince Nataku, a celestial battle lord whose abuse at the hands of the emperor and his father reached epic proportions.  And the individual losses of Homura and his companions.

At the opposite side to Homura is Sanzo, Gojyo, Hakkai, and Goku - a priest, a couple of demons, and a monkey god.  Or are they more than that.  As the story of the events in Heaven unfolds and more becomes clear, we meet their cognates.  Are the avatars?  Exiles?  Gods themselves?  While this set of episodes has yet to yield the final answers it brings us right up to the final battle at Homura's tower, where we learn that little Goku, the ever-hungry monkey holds the key to the final apocalypse.

The first episode gives us a closer view of Xenon on of Homura's co-conspirators.  While seeking a missing scripture Xenon is sidetracked by the problems facing a village and we discover that yet another of Sanzo's opponents has a positive side as well.  In the next episode Homura decides it is time and moves against Sanzo in an attack on the Seiten scripture.  The remaining episodes show the origins of these events in the Heavens even as Sanzo rushes to attack the tower.

Two things stand out at this point - one is the strength of Goku's affection for Sanzo.  Whenever Sanzo is down, Goku becomes frantic.  If there is one thing that can catapult the Monkey God into extreme action it is his admiration for the monk, despite Sanzo's persistent abuse.  Another is the relationship between Sanzo (Konzen in Heaven) and Sanzo.  While the monk clearly doesn't want an end to the celestial order, he has more in common with Homura than he will admit.  This too needs to play out in the end.

While these are all good episodes they don't reach the intensity of the previous DVD.  For all the confrontations here, this is the lull before the storm.  Goku has some shining moments and the story picks up pace quickly.  It surprises me that a series this long can still muster compelling interest.  Hats off to the scriptwriters!",1109635200,5,2384,4.657074340527578
