3588179,4,B001FPKJN2,"Yoga Journal's Yoga for Well-Being offers three short (20 minutes each) yoga sequences, each with a different area of focus.  The practices are led by yoga instructor and Yoga Journal contributing editor Jason Crandell, who provides instruction via voiceover while model Kathryn Budig demonstrates the postures.  Each sequence begins with a very brief introduction by Crandell and then flows right into the practice, which features Budig alone in a studio with gentle, non-obtrusive music playing in the background.  Although Crandell cues all of the poses in English, both the English and the Sanskrit names appear on screen briefly at the start of each new posture.

The Main Menu of the DVD allows you to select each practice individually or to choose a ""Play All"" option.  I have described each sequence in greater detail below:

Mental Clarity.
Crandell states that the emphasis for this practice is on standing forward bends, balancing postures, and twists.  Certainly the practice includes plenty of poses in the first two categories, although few in the last two.  The session begins in down dog, moving into standing forward bend and then the first balance posture, tree pose.  Next comes a standing series which includes triangle, side angle, and wide-legged standing forward bend; standing forward bend is practiced between each of these postures.  This series is followed by the only other balance pose, eagle.  The practice then moves to the floor for down dog, child's pose, and the only twisting posture, sage 3 pose.  After bridge pose and knees to chest, the practice ends in a very brief (<1 minute savasana)--the only practice on this DVD to end in relaxation pose.

Greater Energy.
The focus for this sequence is supposed to be on standing poses and shoulder openers to revive energy.  Crandell begins with sun salutations:  first half salutes, then lunge salutes, then sun salutation series A.  The initial series of standing postures includes warrior 2, side angle, and triangle pose, first performed all on one side, then repeated on the other side.  A second standing series alternates warrior 1 with pyramid pose.  There is then one final sun salutation to transition to the floor, where the practice ends in a seated position.  Although this was a nice sequence overall, I wasn't sure where the shoulder openers were supposed to be--that is, unless Crandell was considering the arm movements in the standing postures to be shoulder-opening work.

Restful Sleep.
In his introduction, Crandell states that this practice features hip openers, forward bends, and gentle twists (the DVD case also notes the inclusion of restorative postures, but as you will see from my description below, there are no restorative posses included in this sequence).  The practice opens with a series of a seated shoulder openers which includes eagle arms.  A series of hip-opening forward-bending postures follows, with cross-legged forward bend (also performed to each side), cobbler's pose, and wide-legged seated forward bend.  Next comes a lunge series which includes low lunge, lizard pose, and pigeon.  There are also a couple of standing forward bends (traditional and wide-legged), and then another series of seated forward bends featuring forward bending in cobbler's pose and in a wide-legged twisting position.  This practice ends in child's pose with the suggestion to continue in savasana if desired.

Overall, these are three well-done, well-designed practices, although I didn't quite feel that the sequences matched their stated goals (e.g., I would've liked to see restorative postures in the sleep practice).  Crandell does a nice job with the voiceover instruction, providing good cueing and alignment pointers and generally allowing enough time for transitions between the postures (although the start of the sleep practice felt a bit rushed to me).  As stated on the DVD case, these practices would be appropriate for beginning and intermediate students; I would actually recommend these sequences to all but those brand-new to yoga, as Crandell assumes a basic prior familiarity with the postures.  The DVD offers a short (3-minute) bonus interview in which Crandell describes his own history with back injury, anxiety, and insomnia.  He makes the case that while 60-90 minutes of yoga per day is ideal, not everyone has time for this, and so he emphasizes that even 10-20 minutes of yoga per day can provide excellent benefits.  This is a valid point, and so for those who are looking to fit shorter sessions of yoga into their day, this DVD might be a great place to start.",1224806400,53,4601,5.193766937669377

3588182,5,B001FPKJN2,"I have been doing yoga for over 3 years. I consider myself an adv-beginner to intermediate yogi. Given injuries which arose from my practice initially, I became fussy about good instruction. But, deep down, I also love a well put-together DVD. This one has both.
The wardrobing complements the focus of the practice, the venue is a honey-colored wooden floor in a softly-bright studio, the music and voice are perfectly balanced. This video is EXCEPTIONALLY instructed. The first portion is a 20-or so minute segment to cultivate mental clarity and the narrator/choreographer, Jason, chooses to mostly gently remind the yogi to watch the gaze, remember and ease the eyes throughout. NICE! The 2nd portion is to wake up - and consists of nicely do-able sun salutations. (But I'm not a huge fan of sun salutations.). My fave section was the 3rd, devoted to hip and shoulder opening. The pose sequence is divine. I didn't hesitate to buy this DVD after renting it and doing the workouts several times.",1404950400,,998,4.946428571428571
3588183,3,B001FPKJN2,"I didn't end up keeping this DVD -- I just didn't love the routines.  I recommend Crunch Candlelight Yoga or Hala Khouri's stress reduction DVD, if you are looking for a restful, nighttime type yoga practice.",1404864000,,208,4.777777777777778

3588185,5,B001FPKJN2,"I like Jason C DVD, I own ""yoga journal morning, noon, night ""  too . I like this one is better than that.
I have been practice at home with those two DVD, which easy to choose each period, each time.
those  lesson is 15 minutes, and good enough to feeling better than nothing.
Highly recommended .",1403827200,,298,4.2105263157894735
3588186,5,B001FPKJN2,"To be fair, I take classes with Jason Crandell so I already quite like his style. He's very non-judgmental but precise, always offers 'beyond 101' tips for the internal and subtle work of the pose, as well as alternate poses for different bodies and abilities. What is rather astonishing is the ways in which these practices really pack a punch and deliver as they're titled. Fer instance the mental clarity one has a lot of forward bends and forehead resting against something, active poses. These are really great for quieting and focusing the mind. The greater energy practice is the most vigorous and it really will wake you up! I like to do a quick 20min practice in the morning as a way to start my day and its had a good effect. ;)",1392249600,,738,4.514925373134329
3588187,4,B001FPKJN2,Didn't explain enough but still good to use. Would still recommend on getting it but would like for it to be slower and more relax,1380326400,,130,4.24
3588188,3,B001FPKJN2,"Very clear instruction and movement demonstrations. however, there are only a couple of moves in each 15-20 session. there are only 3 sessions included. Therefore, I feel it did not offer much for the price.",1372550400,,207,4.942857142857143
3588189,5,B001FPKJN2,I love the practices. I like that there isn't extraneous talk. It's all about the poses and transitions etc. I also like that the person narrating isn't the one doing the yoga practices. Each practice does what it says it will too. I recommend this DVD if you're interested in moderate yoga practices.,1371686400,,301,4.69811320754717
3588190,4,B001FPKJN2,"I really liked the CD, want to learn more about relaxing the body and this has some great ideas for me to try.  Great value for my dollar.",1361577600,,138,3.9285714285714284
3588191,5,B001FPKJN2,"I spent over a week pouring over yoga dvd's on amazon and college video ( where you can see a clip of every dvd )i also watched clips on youtube. After all the research i knew what i wanted in my first dvd. I love the relaxing, cool uncluttered way the dvd was produced as well as crandells voice over. it is clear, simple, no mono logging, chatty or irritating talk. The voice tone makes all the difference to me in any workout video, esp yoga- where i want to be able to relax. It is clear engaging instructions. The moves/poses are just what I wanted and needed as a beginner.",1343347200,,579,4.225225225225225
3588192,5,B001FPKJN2,"Bought this CD a few years ago when I first started Yoga.  I still use it.  If I can't get to my yoga practice I pull out one of Jason's CD's and just love life on my mat in the comfort of my own home.  Jason's voice is very direct and soothing.  He often reminds you to be aware of your posture. He brings you through many hip openers, standing poses and sun salutations.  When I first read 20 minutes my thought was what is that going to do for me.  I'm happy to say that I feel rejuvenated after following a sequence.  So if you are new to yoga or an intermediate yogi who enjoys following a command to your next position I highly recommend this CD.  The models are beautiful",1335830400,2,678,4.083333333333333
3588193,4,B001FPKJN2,I like this video mainly because I am a beginner.  I can see how I can outgrow this video as I move forward in my practice.  I like the 3 short 20 minute segments.  I like the option of mixing and matching or doing all 3 segments.,1322352000,2,230,3.851063829787234
3588194,5,B001FPKJN2,Excellent video for us 50+ gals.  Smooth transitions between poses.  No nonsense voice-over by Jason.  Perfect variety of poses.  One of my weekly yoga video staples.,1308268800,2,166,5.269230769230769
3588195,5,B001FPKJN2,I have found some Yoga DVDs too vigorous for me and some too unchallenging.  This DVD is perfect for me.  I have been practicing Yoga for over 8 years and am 69 years if age.  However I think it is suitable for younger ages too.,1295740800,,228,4.022222222222222
3588196,5,B001FPKJN2,Perfect for short practices and fun to do.  Not over the top like most.  Enjoy it a few times a week now.,1253836800,2,105,3.727272727272727
3588197,5,B001FPKJN2,"I found the DVD to have fun routines. I appreciate their brevity. I agree with the one reviewer that the restful sleep routine could have benefitted from a corpse pose. I think Jason does a great voice over. The model is easy on the eyes. She looks and moves like a real person, not some rubber pretzel in human form. The pace of the DVD fits my style, slow enough to appreciate the pose, but fast enough that you don't feel like you are waiting like some beginner discs. I appreciate that the DVD keeps to the asanas and physical/mental techniques and does not stray into areas of yoga I don't want to go.

I have found that the 20 minute format for the routines along with the excellent flow and presentation of the routines to be just what I need to stay disciplined to do any given routine regularly (six days per week). I have been doing yoga for over a year. I have noticed much improved flexibility in my hips and lumbar region and lost an inch off of my waistline since the 2 months I have used the DVD. (Primarily the Restful Sleep routine). My kids wake me up at any hour of the night, so I can't say it has improved my sleep!  ;) So, I am getting satisfying results and find it easy to stay motivated with the DVD. 5 stars for me and my lifestyle.

I'll be purchasing more of the Yoga Journal DVDs, especially those by Jason.",1232150400,10,1336,4.251968503937008
3588198,5,B001FPKJN2,"I bought both of these new Yoga Journal DVDs mainly because I know Jason Crandell to be an excellent teacher, though I did expect that the sequences in the two DVDs (Yoga for Well-Being and Yoga for Morning, Noon and Night) to be somewhat similar. But I've used the night-time sequence from the second one as well as the restful-sleep one from the first one, and they're definitely not the same... though both left me ready for bed (in a good way!).",1230940800,8,449,4.487804878048781
3588199,5,B001FPKJN2,"This is the second of Jason Crandell's yoga dvd's that I have tried.  As with his other dvd, Mr. Crandell's pose and sequence descriptions are very detailed, but concise and efficient so your practice can flow nicely.  The sessions work great individually but also work well combined, which makes this a very versatile dvd.  I highly recommend both this dvd and Jason Crandell's other dvd, Yoga for Morning, Noon and Night.",1230768000,9,423,4.929577464788732
8302252,5,B001FPKJN2,Received it quickly.  This is a great yoga dvd as are all by Jason Crandell.  I like how this one is oriented to different times of the day & each session is just 20 min. long so you can do one or more depending on your needs or time.,1510704000,,234,3.7551020408163267
8302253,5,B001FPKJN2,Jason  has a nice easy-going style In this very accessible yoga dvd. Its slower pace is nice for those days I'd like to show it down and get deeper into my practice and refine my postures.,1498521600,,188,4.222222222222222
8302254,5,B001FPKJN2,"I enjoy these practices very much but I can see how they can be potentially challenging for people who are not used to any exercises. Jason is a great teacher. These sequences are short but provide a full body work out, so you can practice yoga even if you're busy with work or school.",1493337600,,285,4.296296296296297
