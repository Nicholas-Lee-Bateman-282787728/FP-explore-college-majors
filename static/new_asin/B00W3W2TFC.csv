7119651,1,B00W3W2TFC,"What is Awaken like?
 Imagine trying to play Far Cry 3 if your controller were on the fritz and you could only watch helplessly, your character suffering the fate of running aimlessly and changing direction only by bumping into something.
 Imagine watching a more cryptic version of LOST plagued by boring dialogue and no comic relief (or relief of any kind).

Cinematography 
Although the are some appealing wide shots of Belize (one of two locations where this was filmed), they don't really count since a filmmaker would need to work extremely hard to make Belize look bad. Nothing else worth mentioning.

Plot 
This would have been a much more enjoyable flick had it just been footage of tropical jungle without the people.

Actors 
Natalia ""Burn"" Guslistaya stars as the protagonist of this unintentional comedy; it's difficult to discern whether her character is intended to come off as having brain damage or whether the actress actually suffers from some kind of affliction (I'm not a mean person... only trying to warn you). The rest of the cast is a rogues gallery of actors either in desperate need of a paycheck between gigs or in need of a vacation in beautiful Belize (and really, I can hardly blame them for saying yes to a bad flick in exchange for the vacation). Awaken featured exactly one character who was both likable and not cookie-cutter: Stitch, played by Daz Crawford.

Even if you *hated* LOST, I still recommend watching LOST reruns instead of Awaken.",1437264000,,1478,4.88
7119652,4,B00W3W2TFC,"Good stuff. Tough girl, good fighting sequences, fairly good acting. Slightly weird story line,but believable at the same time.  I enjoyed it.",1437264000,,142,5.454545454545454
7119653,3,B00W3W2TFC,"Billie (Natalie Burn) finds herself stranded on an island dirty, sandy,  wearing designer jeans, and full of flashbacks to her marshal arts training  and looking for her sister. She meets up with similar people stranded on the island and occasionally a group of bad guys, lead by Vinnie Jones, show up and grab one for....the plot spoiler written in the movie description on the back of the DVD. Robert Davi is the leader of the island group. Daryl Hannah shows up late whose career has stagnated as an evil old woman cameo.

The film is basically formula. I waited for the twist(s) which weren't exciting. Look to see more of the talented Natalie Burn.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1436745600,,689,4.716666666666667
7119654,4,B00W3W2TFC,"(Awaken) is a movie about organ harvesters who own two islands. One for the actual procedures to take place and another where their  soon to be victims wake up on shore having no clue how they got there. The harvesters  make sure the captives eat fruit and clean thier systems out before they hunt them for the operations!

There's a really good ensemble cast of you might say ""has beens"" like( Daryl Hannah) (David Keith)(Jason London) etc. There's also (Michael Copon) and the awesome (Natalie Burn).

It's pretty good,some of it believable some of it not so much. Burn as Billie steals the show as a butt kickng ,tough but hot new captive girl. The story is interesting enough to pull you in and keep you watching because you want to see how the characters fare because the character development for the main characters is good .There are a couple of not so surprising twists that add a little spice.

There is violence but nothing really gory save one scene of a cadaver who's organs have been taken..The fight choreography was good and fun to watch especially when Billie was kicking butt! There are also alot of gun fights.  Over all it's definitely worth a watch especially if you like the fight or die or trapped on an island type genres.

7119691,2,B00W3W2TFC,"Awaken is a thriller/horror about a diverse group of people who are drugged and wake up on a remote South American island where they are hunted down by a group of paramilitary soldiers.  The latest victim to end up on the island is Billie Kope, who had been searching for her missing sister and asking the wrong questions in the wrong places.  She wakes up on the island where she is quickly friended by other residents Nick (Copon), Todd, Berto (Furlong), and Stitch.  They take Billie back to their camp to meet their leader, Quentin (Davi) who has been on the island the longest. Awaken-dvd

Quentin claims to have no knowledge about the men who are hunting them or the reason why.  But heyIts Robert Davi!  The guy has made a career of playing sinister villains so were supposed to trust him?  Billie is well versed in the martial arts and she leads a group on a raft to another nearby island where she has her first encounter with the soldiers under the command of Sarge (Jones) and including Xander (Pare).  It is soon revealed that they all work for a man called Rich (London) who runs the island and uses the victims to harvest their organs to sell to wealthy customers on the black market.  One of those customers is Mao (Hannah) who has come to the island in the hopes that Dr. Walsh (Keith) can use the organs to save her daughter.

Admittedly, it is pretty cool to see actors like David Keith, Michael Pare, Daryl Hannah, Robert Davi, Jason London, and Edward Furlong together in the same film.  All of them can make claims to starring in some of the most classic films of the 1980s and 1990s like An Officer and a Gentleman, Eddie and the Cruisers, The Goonies, Dazed and Confused, Splash, and Terminator 2.  As you might expect, each of them chews as much scenery as they can in what was limited screen time for most of them.  Hannah and Furlong are particularly entertainingFurlong as a wacked out kidnap victim and Hannah as the evil socialite who doesnt care who has to be killed to save her daughter.  Add into the mix tough guy baddie Vinnie Jones and Michael Copon, who is best known for playing the Blue Ranger in Power Rangers: Time Force, and you have a B movie cast for the ages.

Where Awaken falters is first with its female lead, Natalie Burn.  The Ukrainian actress had a bit part in Expendables 3 but most of her credits were in Russian films and TV shows.  While she displays some decent fighting skills shes certainly not in the same class as Gina Carano or Ronda Rousey.  Things get worse when shes not fighting.  Shes far too stiff to carry the load of the narrative as shes asked to do and while her accent is slight its enough to make it hard to buy that she is an American.  The attempt at a romantic angle between her character and Nick has all the spark of a tuna sandwich.

Awaken recycles a similar plot that has been used in far better films like The Condemned and Battle Royale so earns little points for originality.",1442016000,,2959,4.452690166975882
7119692,4,B00W3W2TFC,I really enjoyed this move. Lots of action and drama. Kept my attention through the entire movie. Some good acting with a great cast of people. Highly recommended.,1440892800,,163,4.857142857142857

7119694,5,B00W3W2TFC,"I loved this film! The fight scenes with Billie are absolutely amazing, Miss Burn is a very talented actress who demonstrates that woman can still kick ass in `Hollywood. Not only is she sexy but she has great emotional range",1438905600,,225,4.65
8711997,2,B00W3W2TFC,"For a small, independent, real-life horror film, Awaken has a lot of pieces to it's story, there really is a lot going on, in what initially seemed like a cut and dry story. If this film had been done a bit differently, and if it's impressive cast had been used for more than simple cameos, this may have been a much better film. The story begins with Billie (Natalie Burn) waking up on an island, being chased by strangers, and rescued by another group of strangers. She comes to learn that everyone in her group of rescuers woke up as she did, and appear to be hunted for sport. Billie wants to escape to one of the nearby cluster of islands, but learns that attempts have been made, and no one has ever come back, but Billie is a military brat and refuses to accept that. The story here is very well written, especially for this type of film, but everything is so anti-climatic. Just about every scene turns into a fight scene or a shoot out and there is nothing original about that. Honestly, what is the point of having this great story idea if ever scene is going to end up the same way? There is also the fact that the casting is a complete mystery. This film managed to get Darryl Hannah, Edward Furlong, David Keith, and Robert Davi and they simply make cameo appearances in ancillary roles? If that's the case, why even waste the money to bring them in? Awaken had the story, it had the cast, it had the looks, it even had a premium location, but poor dialogue, predictable outcomes, a misused cast, and a painfully horrendous ending absolutely destroyed what could have otherwise been a rather entertaining film.",1475625600,,1623,4.486486486486487

8712003,4,B00W3W2TFC,"One could do worse than this direct-to-DVD grade B action thriller. Although the plot is somewhat predictable, the story is surprisingly entertaining and has many unexpected twists and turns. The acting is fair. There is the usual cast of B movie stars here including Vinnie Jones and Robert Davi. Legendary actress Daryl Hannah makes an interesting addition to the story. By and large, Awaken, while certainly not a box office blockbuster, is worth taking the time to watch.",1451260800,,475,5.102564102564102
8712004,2,B00W3W2TFC,"On a good day this movie would not please many.  The acting is pretty lame and the context is right up there with, well, not much.

People are kidnapped and taken to an island where they are nothing more than hosts for their organs.  Mao (a broken down looking Daryl Hannah) takes Violet to a neighboring island where the harvesters live.  Poor little Violet needs bits and pieces from one or more of the hosts.  So sad, too bad.

It's amazing how the mighty have fallen.  To see Hannah in this role is to know how hard up for must be for work.  And another thing... SOMEONE needs to explain to me why a soldier has to do summersaults before shooting.  C'mon!  That move took twice as much effort as just moving forward to get to the same spot.

The last thing... It's pretty pathetic that the best ""soldier"" was the one who really WASN'T a soldier.",1450742400,,849,4.343949044585988
