7998736,3,B0000CBY19,If you're interested in looking at what the punk scene looked like then and some of the bands and people that listened to them then this DVD is definitely worth a watch. However it's not the best quality (meaning definitely not HD but watchable) and some of the performances are live but the audio doesn't sound like it was from the live show but rather added later. Which sort of bothered me but was ok. For the price it's definitely worth a look and even if you don't enjoy it as much as I did you'll only be out six bucks.,1417564800,,525,4.207920792079208

Indeed I do feel cheated!! Who cares about The stuff that was on this D.V.D.?? An interview with Billy Idol?? ""What a sissy!!"" Anybody who want's to learn more, About how ""punk rock"" started. Won't learn anything worth knowing, From this D.V.D.!! If You are a ""punk rock"" fan... Maybe You'll see something on this D.V.D. You'll like?? But it's truly doubtful!!! I would have to say, Buying this D.V.D. is a waste of time and money!!!!",1317859200,,583,4.782178217821782
7998739,1,B0000CBY19,"""Ever get the feeling you've been ripped off?"" - John Lydon. Well, that's how John used to begin his PIL performances. And it applies very nicely to this DVD. You have the adverts, a great band, but you soon learn that they were horrible live. You have the sex pistols, a great live band, but you never actually see them perform- you see lots of british parade guards, maybe for the jubilee. you see little posters of the sex pistols. and you keep cutting to some girl who had something to do with hooking johnny up with malcolm. as a previous reviewer noted, the generation x song is not synchronized to the band. what he didn't mention is that billy idol barely lifts the microphone anywhere near his mouth while he's supposedly singing. it's absurd. you've got some live X-ray spex, but they're playing to an empty room. doesn't make for the most exciting footage. bunch of mediocre interviews. perhaps the best is with the late marc bolan. he predicts that in five years, all the punk bands would be using strings, but really aggressive ones. he should have predicted they'd all be dead, himself included. well, there was a string version of some sex pistols song on the great rock and rock 'n rock swindle. and, just when you're thinking ""this has to get better,"" it's over. i like almost anything related to punk rock. i didn't like this at all. - d",1257292800,4,1355,4.557377049180328
7998740,5,B0000CBY19,"Originally named ""Raw Energy"", that title reflected perfectly what this film was about. It captured what was going on in the London punk scene at street level, through great bands that were actually playing regularly, unlike the Pistols, who had been relegated to no more than a media phenomenom in 1977-78 because, as they talk about in the film, they couldn't play anywhere because of the furore the media had created which caused town councils across the UK to ban their shows. Because this film was capturing a slice of what was going on at the time, it doesn't attempt to be some great all-encompassing film about everything going on in English punk rock, but merely a very representative look at it through one set of groups and people. I know everything I need to know about the Sex Pistols and Clash and the usual suspects, so it's fantastic that they concentrated on groups like the Adverts, Slits, and X Ray Spex, some of the most edgy bands of the London scene, and notably bands that all had women in them or in the case of the Slits, were entirely comprised of women.

  In dramatic contrast to ""Decline of Western Civilization"", which tried to be the same sort of film set in LA with a much bigger budget, this film actually is filled with intelligent commentary from fans, band members, even shockingly enough the record company people interviewed. It's comical watching the Adverts interrupt each other while trying to make sure they explain ""Gary Gilmore's Eyes"" properly.

  Though the inclusion of an Eddie and the Hot Rods live performance is seen as ""not punk"" by purists and perhaps their relation to punk isn't explained thoroughly enough (they do a fantastic cover of ""Get Out of Denver""), they were part of the rock bands that stood out by embracing punk at the time. There were bands like the Tom Robinson Band and others who were notable for touring with punk bands and being excited at how much energy punk was bringing back to music, even while their own material remained rock and roll. That's the whole point of the Marc Bolan interview, showing that there were existing rockers who joined in and participated in the new excitement, and helped promote it. The New York Dolls had been a huge inspiration for English punk bands, giving glam an attitude, and a lot of the glam rockers recognized that punk was taking some of what they had been trying to do and getting that much more outrageous with it.

  There are so many priceless moments in it for true fans of punk history - Siouxsie talking about being considered fascists merely because she ""liked to wear a certain badge"" is comical. It's even cool to see a young Billy Idol talk with sincere enthusiasm, rather than the old, strutting rock and roll hack we've seen for so many years now. Mark P of the zine Sniffin Glue and the band Alternative TV is a constant intelligent voice interviewed throughout, who pretty much invented the concept of the photocopied punk zine. Sure some of the accents are difficult, but that's life and just a problem for Americans, punks don't speak BBC English.

  For someone who knows little about the bands portrayed and the scene, it might be confusing because it doesn't waste time trying to be a primer, so for those people Caroline Coon's book ""1988"" would be a essential read to put everything in the film into context. As a serious punk historian - I wrote the book ""Going Underground: American Punk 1979-1992"" - for me this film with all its rough edges captures the honest revolutionary spirit of punk from a ground level perspective better than any other documentary I've seen. Could have there been a ton of other things in it? Sure, I'd love a Ken Burns style six hour series on punk that intelligently did the subject justice for once and included everyone, but I think it's amazing that someone even took the time to capture this culture as it happened, and these kind of documents should be prized.",1142467200,35,3933,4.6923076923076925
7998741,2,B0000CBY19,"This is a really disappointing product for a couple major reasons. First, there's the logistical problems. So much of the footage is poor and so badly-cut together that me and my husband, both punk fanatics, wanted to turn it off out of frustration at how jumpy and un-followable the narrative was. Second is the truly unforgivable part and that's the incomprehensible leaving out of so many pertinent bands and events. I understand if you can't cover everyone, of course you can't, but they left out more than they included. Really disappointing...I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again.",1140825600,6,590,4.96969696969697
7998742,4,B0000CBY19,"...then this DVD is invaluable.  The previous reviewer of this DVD apparently had a strange or romanticized idea of what early UK punk was like.  The reviewer's description of The Adverts as ""no name"" will suffice to indicate his or her level of sophistication and knowledge of UK punk.

  I think that this ""warts and all"" film does a better job than any other I've seen of getting across the giddy experimentalism, frenetic posing, and just sheer lunacy of early UK punk.  The American equivalent would be the original DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION, which takes a similarly honest look at the highs 'n lows of the LA punk scene circa 1980.

  True, The Slits couldn't really play when this was shot.  That was the point.  True, X-Ray Spex were not terribly polished.  True, there was a certain amount of uncertainty about what ""really counted"" as ""punk,"" and some former pub rock bands like the Hot Rods did get lumped together with more overtly punky bands.  True, there were moments of boredom and tedium in the birth of punk; punk was (among other things) a reaction against a sense of ceaseless boredom and this film manages in its rough way to capture some of the atmosphere.

  If, like the previous reviewer, you'd like to have a nice, polished MTV video for your documentary of UK punk, well, this DVD isn't it.  If you'd like something a bit more accurate, however, then this is a fine companion piece to FILTH & FURY and WESTWAY TO THE WORLD.",1123977600,28,1456,4.647058823529412
7998743,1,B0000CBY19,"Most of the live performances feature no-name and decidedly non-punk acts like Eddie and the Hot Rods and the Adverts. The Gen X footage is not synched with the song, The Slits can barely play their instruments, and most of the interviews are brief and (to my american ears)unintelligeable. This ""documentary"" will not help those who weren't there appreciate the power and impact of early Brit punk, nor will will it provide any pleasant nostalgia for the old farts. Get ""The Filth and the Fury"" instead...",1112659200,14,506,4.895348837209302
