2934486,5,B000VAHR7I,"The most entertaining low budget film I think I've ever seen.

I always bring this one out to watch with folks I want to shock and amaze. It will confuse, delight, and likely (on some level) disgust you. It's uniquely crass, but clever in execution. Expect some Archer-esque Adult Swim style humor. Off color, off key, but not without a touch of social commentary. This movie will ruin your image of Anna Chlumsky if the only thing you remember her from is My Girl.

There hasn't been a movie this quotable since Anchorman.

It's also worth noting that this isn't a long movie. It's the perfect length for something like this. It won't drag on, or get dull, or wear all of its jokes too thin. It's gonna leave you feeling like you need to share this with strangers.",1385856000,,765,4.489208633093525
2934487,5,B000VAHR7I,"To make this simple: If you didn't like Toxic Avenger, chances are you will be wasting your time watching this movie.

In the future gas prices reach $35.00 a gallon. Only the rich drive cars. Even riding in a car is a status symbol. People still have sex in cars except they are now at junkyards. Archie teaches kindergarten. He reads to them about the ""Little Engine that Could"" while instructing the toddlers on the Kyoto Treaty. Archie is a dedicated vegan who buys wheatgerm as he is attempting to find a way to run his car on it. Anna Chlumsky (can I buy a vowel?) as Lorrain runs the vegan stand and wants Archie, dropping hits and drawing obscene pictures of her and Archie.

Meanwhile Katie Rowlett (Denise) plays a nympho who runs a booth labeled ""meat."" Likewise she has designs on Archie. During his experiments, Archie cuts himself on a broken vodka bottle and spills some blood into his mixture and discovers that his engine can run on blood. After killing the neighborhood pets with a BB or pellet gun, he discovers only human blood can make the engine go. The status of driving the vehicle, as well as the sex that goes along with it, is an aphrodisiac too powerful for Archie to ignore. Oh yes, the government wants the car and Archie too.

Parental Guide: Frequent use of the f-bomb, MF, nudity, and sex.",1282348800,2,1322,4.546218487394958
2934488,4,B000VAHR7I,"In the near future the price of gas is 40 bucks a gallon, as a result nearly no one drives. However a young kinder garden teacher decides to change all that and make a car engine that runs on wheat grass, he do not have much success before he accidentally cuts himself and discovers that his engine runs on human blood. Soon the young teacher hooks up with a sexy but shallow girl who will do anything to ride in a car, this lead to our dear hero having to fill up his tank now and again. To make things worse the government wants the blood car and are willing to kill to get it. What follows is a crazy, hilarious story.

I really like this film. It is completely insane. This is more humor than horror and I laugh my butt of watching it. I really do recommend. This movie is a good example of independent filmmakers making the most of a low budget. Blood Car is funny, creative and completely hilarious, watch it.",1280966400,,915,4.228571428571429
2934489,3,B000VAHR7I,"Neither particularly funny or scary, Blood Car (2007) is still a horror/comedy film, that holds your interest mostly because of its quirky premise, strange story, and off beat characters.  With decent production values, the independently produced, low budget feature was reportedly shot in twelve days, in and around Atlanta.

The script plays fast and loose with reality, as with gasoline costing over thirty dollars a gallon, vegan elementary school teacher Archie Andrews (Mike Brune), is conducting experiments to try and develop fuel from wheatgrass juice.  Andrews bikes to work, and gets his wheatgrass supply from a small stand in the middle of a nowhere, run by Lorraine (Anna Chlumsky).  After accidentally discovering that blood causes his small experimental motor to work, he finds that he is able to start his car using his own blood.  Rigging up a sword-like rotor blade in his trunk to puree flesh, Archie kills pets and small animals with a BB gun, and converts them to fuel.  When a neighbor passes away of natural causes, Archie crosses the line, using a human body to top off his fuel tank.  Having wheels, turns the nerdy Andrews into a chick magnet, and he soon hooks up with sexy Denise (Katie Rowlett), who runs the meat stand, next to the vegetable stand.  Archie soon discovers that he will do anything, to keep his car running.

Blood Car has tons of gaping plot holes, starting with the premise that pureed flesh can power an internal combustion engine.  With the only functioning car around, Archie should be focus of much attention, but remains relatively anonymous, with mostly young women who seem to notice him.  One of the most absurd aspects is that the Government has him under surveillance, is aware of his activities, and does nothing when crimes are committed.  When the Government does step in, the results are tragic and extreme.

Archie Andrews is one pretty weird guy, and between keeping the blood car fueled up, pursuing his suddenly overactive love life, and taking on Government agents, there's usually enough to hold your interest, no matter how kooky things get.  There are few scares, but the film delivers most of its violence in a subdued fashion.  Even an axe plunged wound to the chest, doesn't seem very gruesome.  Director/co-writer Alex Orr finishes his film in a blaze of violence, that some may find controversial or offensive.  Blood Car's low key, off the wall approach, and twisted humor, isn't for everyone.  The performances by Brune, Rowlett, and Chlumsky (My Girl), really help to sell the story.

There are extra features, but most are rather unpolished.  This includes some behind the scenes footage, and a stitched together commentary track that is semi-informative regarding techniques and influences.",1278892800,,2770,5.046153846153846
2934490,5,B000VAHR7I,"Mike Brune (RETURN OF THE JACKALOPE), Anna Chlumsky (MY GIRL), Katie Rowlett (S.I.N.), Matt Hutchinson (BLOOD CAR) and Marla Malcolm (2001 MANIACS) star in BLOOD CAR, a dark comedy which takes place a few weeks into the future and gas prices increased to $30 per  gallon. It's about an elementary school teacher who invents a car that runs on human blood. This movie has what you'd expect; beautiful topless girls and gross out blood. I give this movie a 5 out of 5 star rating.",1251331200,3,478,4.623529411764705
2934491,5,B000VAHR7I,"In the future, gasoline is outrageously expensive (yep, even worse than today). No one drives automobiles, leaving the amorous youth nowhere to shag except for in junkyards. Luckily, one man has been working on a solution. Archie (Mike Brune) has been experimenting on a motor powered by wheatgrass juice. Too bad the results are less than satisfactory. One day, Archie accidentally cuts himself, getting his blood mixed in with the green juice / fuel. Eureka! This is the breakthrough he's been waiting for! Unfortunately, a car engine is many times larger (and thirstier) than Archie's tiny test motor, forcing him to find an ever increasing supply of the red stuff. Things get pretty gooshy! Is this all done in the name of science? Humanity? Nah, Archie has to be able to drive in order to pick up the local, sexually insatiable badgirl (Katie Rowlett), who just happens to love riding in cars. As we will see, a man will go to extremes for such a thing! Uh-oh! It appears that the government has taken notice! Archie soon finds himself tracked, abducted, and interrogated by  government agents bent on obtaining his bloody secrets! BLOOD CAR is a hilarious horrorcom in the tradition of LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (only far more adult). Watch for Anna Chlumsky as Archie's lovesick wheatgrass supplier. If black humour, parody, and social satire make you laugh out loud, and a bit of crimson spatter doesn't bother your sensibilities, then BC is a must!...",1247011200,,1457,4.9227642276422765

It played like a John Walters movie and I kept expecting Divine and Edith Massey to walk on. There was no gore and not particulary funny in fact I could nt wait for it to end. Might have appriciated it more if I had had a few cans.

2934494,5,B000VAHR7I,"So silly it can't help but be hilarious!!
A vegetarian develops a car that runs on human blood,
due to soaring gas prices ($40 a gallon)
For the lack of settings, special eff..... well much of anything really,
the story is suprisingly enjoyable, ridiculously hilarious, and above all else it delivers!
Nudity is abundant, and the gore (or lack there of) is silly at best.
That being said,
This one comes highly recommended for fans of horror/comedy!!
Funnier than anything from Troma,
even without the campy special effects & surplus of gore.

2934496,5,B000VAHR7I,"I will be glad to throw another 5 star review like most of the others here have. The nice thing about low budget movies is that there is a freedom for the filmmakers to do whatever they want. Though most filmmakers don't exercise this freedom and try to make cheap looking versions of big budget success's, Blood Car instead has happily ripped up and thrown out the movie rule book altogether. This movie is a mixure of extreme gore and extremely clever humor mixed up with some crude humor and a few scenes throw in for shock value that work perfectly. It really is a gem.

I wasn't sure what to expect but knowing the title gave me incentive to see how 'blood' and a 'car' could be possibly enfused together to create a movie. It was hilarious! Blood Car was far-fetched to the point where there was no way you couldn't laugh. Lots of blood, an intimidating thug, ridiculous government officials, some hot girls, a nice kid turned bad(for a cause), and some innocent school children come together to make Blood Car the funniest, bloodiest movie in years to come. If you like comedy and low budget horror then don't hesitate to purchase Blood Car. You'll love it!

8217801,2,B000VAHR7I,"There are numerous movies made each and every year on miniscule budgets by film makers that have yet to establish themselves as marketable. Its a catch-22 situation where most studios won't hire an unknown to make a movie but at the same time won't give them a movie to make until theyve got one in the can. What those film makers do is find financing from where ever they can and make a movie that gives them something to take with them. Some of them are good, some bad, some show there is no hope and other that there is potential. The most common genre made are horror movies; easy to make, easy to market and you don't need a group of major thespians to get the job done.

That being said I wasn't sure what to expect with BLOOD CAR. The artwork certainly screams drive-in with a woman riding in a topless car, shirt open but nothing quite revealed, holding a Molotov cocktail, the car driven by a man screaming and wielding an axe. For those unaware this is definitely not a movie for the Disney crowd. No, this is a movie made for the millions of exploitation/drive-in/horror crowd. The film goers that love to hit the midnight movie with no hope of catching the highest of cinema. This is a movie made for those who worship at the altar of Joe Bob Briggs and his three Bs of how to value a movie: blood, beasts and breasts. While short on beast there is plenty of the other two Bs to keep that crowd happy.

The story opens in the future where gas prices have truly skyrocketed, averaging in the $30 range per gallon. In response people no longer drive cars with few exceptions. Instead vehicles are parked in junk yards and drive-ins where couples gather to, well, couple, thus satisfying the first B for Joe Bob, breasts. Archie Andrews is teacher and inventor trying to find an alternative to gasoline in bio fuels. He stops by a vegan booth to purchase wheat grass from Lorraine (Anna Chlumsky), a young woman who has a crush on Archie that goes unnoticed.

One night while working on his experiment he accidentally cuts his finger, dropping blood into the mixture. Before you can saw LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, the fuel works and the motor runs. Realizing the potential here, Archie converts his cars engine to this motor and is soon driving around the city. But he cant continue to fuel the car with his own blood since doing so leaves him tired and worn out. The solution presents itself in an accident and a victim who is tossed into a converter Archie has installed in his trunk. With enough fuel to drive where he wants, he soon catches the eye of Denise, the hot but low standards girl who operates the meat shack across from Lorraines vegan stand.

Archie and Denise begin to see each other regularly with Archie making sure he has plenty of fuel for the car and Denise willingly handling all of Archies carnal needs. But she really has no interest in him and is there for the car only. Will Archie finally realize this isn't the woman for him? Will he ever fulfill the needs of the lovely Lorraine? Will he ever be able to sell the idea of a car driven by human blood to the masses? And just who are these men in black suits that follow his every move, watching on hidden cameras everywhere he goes?

As I said early on this movie it not Oscar material. Not even Oscar Madison material. But it does deliver a certain amount of charm that some will enjoy, especially those late night crowds I mentioned. The gore level is to the extreme with plenty of blood splatter to make those fans happy. Those looking for skin should probably seek out soft core porn if thats all that matters but there is enough nudity to offend those inclined and satisfy those who arent.

The production level of the movie isn't noteworthy but at the same time the cinematography isn't a complete waste as are a number of movies made at this budgetary level. The acting ranges from good to poor and one has to wonder how Chlumsky ended up here. My best guess is friendship or knowing someone who worked on the film.

Having seen so many of these types of films, being a fan of the drive-in experience, I didn't find it offensive and actually had a laugh or two while watching. As I said at the beginning, film makers need to make their bones by actually making a movie to get started. With each new experience they learn, they develop their craft and hopefully they get the chance to keep moving forward with better films each step of the way. Heres hoping director Alex Orr gets that chance. If you watch this one expecting Oscar material youll be enraged. If you know walking in what to expect from this movie then its not too bad. So rent/buy this movie, pop open a Miller Lite, gather a group of friends around who know how to have a good laugh and enjoy this one.",1427068800,2,4759,4.432
8217802,5,B000VAHR7I,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Quirky horror comedies never get old for me, particularly those with unique premises.  If a film can make me laugh and squirm while still entertaining me, then its a big win.  Such is the case with BLOOD CAR, a 2007 title that poses question, To what lengths will we (as a society go) to drive when gas becomes too expensive?  Part terrifying and part hysterical, this film will make you reevaluate the way you think about your car and its fuel economy.

I love how this film provides a dark social commentary in addition to its gory premise.  I read several subtle undertones in the plot line, including teenage rebellion, our education system, societal perceptions of lifestyle choices, in addition to others.  When a movie can make you think this much and still provide a lot of fun, you know you have a winner on your hands.

BLOOD CAR is a lower-budget film, but it is shot well and looks good overall.  The production crew does a great job of utilizing their budget, and the result is an aesthetically-pleasing film with great sound.

The acting in BLOOD CAR is top notch, with Mike Brune, Anna Chlumsky, and Katie Rowlett portraying the three main characters.  Brune does a great job as the oblivious, love-sick teacher, while Chlumsky and Rowlett shine as his two love interests.  I am not familiar with Brune or Rowlett, however Ive enjoyed Chlumsky as an actress since I saw her way back in the day, in MY GIRL.

The special effects in the film are minimal but good as well.  Theres not a lot of carnage, but we do get a dose of nice gore here and there.  Of particular note is when a government agent gets shoved into the trunk of the car (which is where the Blood Car mulches its victims for their blood), and a spectacular crimson fountain erupts when the car is started.  Additionally, there are a couple of gore-soaked shots of the device itself inside the trunk that look great.

BLOOD CAR is a major win for me, and I recommend it to anyone looking for some gory, quirky fun.  The disc contains a few Special Features that include the theatrical trailer for BLOOD CAR, as well was two short films from the same production company:  THE ADVENTURE and THE $100 SHORT SHORT.  BLOOD CAR is available now in a variety of formats, so give it a look.",1425600000,,2335,4.501187648456057
