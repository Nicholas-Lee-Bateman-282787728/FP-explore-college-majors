Refreshing to see the screens greatest villain in a heroic role for once and to appear in a film which he survives  without being staked,disintegated or burnt to death. Hammer's star director  Terence Fisher is back on fine form with this taut satanic thriller which  is the best adaption of a Dennis Wheatley novel to be translated to the  screen. Chris Lee plays the Duc de Richeleau a nobleman out to protect his  young protege Patrick Mower from falling into the clutches of a group of  satanists led by the excellent Charles Gray (remember him as Blofeld in  Diamonds Are Forever and as Henderson in You Only Live Twice). Excellent  set pieces troughout including a classic scene in which the Angel of Death  turns up on a horse to claim a soul and cannot return empty handed. Superb  acting throughout from all paties including Leon Greene and Nike Arrighi  but this film is a landmark in the careers of both Christopher Lee and  Terence Fisher and its the only Hammer film where both of them can really  excel themselves makes one wonder why the studio didn't use them more  wisely before.

959281,5,6305063486,"I am thankful to Turner Classic Movies (TCM) channel for screening this rare occult film. I say rare because one can hardly find it on DVD unless one is willing to pay an exorbitant amount for it. I wish this film would be made available on DVD, preferably on Blu-Ray, as it is one of the most visually-appealing and highly atmospheric occult films I've ever watched. I read that Christopher Lee considers his role in this film as one of his favorite performances and it isn't difficult to see why. Lee's performance here is not as his usual villain role, but as a titled nobleman, the Duc de Richleau, who is determined on saving the son of his deceased friend from falling victim to a Satanic cult led by the diabolical Mocata (a chilling performance by Charles Gray).

""The Devil Rides Out"" (1968, also known as ""The Devil's Bride"" in the US) centers on Mocata and his cult of devil worshipers who are intent on inducting two young initiates into their cult, the young Simon Aron (Patrick Mower) and the beautiful Tanith Carlisle (Nike Arrighi). Luckily for the young people, the Duc de Richleau (Lee) is on to Mocata's nefarious plan, and together with his friend, Rex (Leon Greene) , the pair come up with a plan to foil Mocata's attempts.

The movie is visually stunning (in fact I was very impressed by the crisp quality of the film awash in brilliant color, almost as if I was watching a Blu-Ray), and the audio is crystal clear. There are many depictions of the dark arts in this film and occult references abound, but rather than cheesy dialogue which I've come to expect in some of these older horror movies, the dialogue was intelligent, elevating the quality of this production to that of a cerebral occult thriller. Lee's character spouts his lines so convincingly the viewer could almost believe whatever he says as being the absolute truth. The role of the good guy is credibly portrayed by Lee and complements the villain role so aptly played by Charles Gray as the evil Mocata whose piercing stare can chill one right to the bone.

There are some genuinely creepy and suspenseful moments in this film and the pacing never lets up, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. I enjoyed watching the plot unfold, and the occult references are well-integrated into the storyline. The production qualities may seem dated and the effects a little tame by today's standards, but the overall impression is one of an artistic and atmospheric film which makes for compelling viewing. This certainly counts as one of the finest offerings by Hammer Films.",1380931200,5,2562,4.739910313901345

I first saw this movie in the theater, and it was then called ""The Devil's Bride,"" which was really a misleading title.  I am glad that it was changed back to the title it bore in the U.K. and on the book on which it was based.  Yes, I have read the book also, but I am not going to criticize the movie for leaving parts of the book out.  The movie was mostly true to the book; strangely enough, I am even going to say that both movie and book are a ""realistic"" portrayal of evil, and how to overcome it -- no, not with magic but by a refusal to compromise and an insistence on staying ""in the light.""

Devil Rides Out is a great film and should be watched by serious horror film enthusiasts. The wonderful Terence Fisher is the director and Chris is the hero for a change. Unlike a lot of Hammer films this one is subtle which adds too the thrills.
Rasputin was made right after Dracula Price of Darkness and has the same cast. Christopher Lee gives a masterful performance as Rasputin which holds this whole film together. It was the script which doomed the production and that was done in by threats of lawsuits over the movie. The end film drags a bit but it is still worth seeing.

959356,3,6305063486,"I bought ""The Devil Rides Out"" from sheer nostalgia. As a teenager I loved Dennis Wheatley novels, and saw the movie at the drive-in. Yes, the nostalgia value was there. But poor Christopher Lee, a legend in his own lifetime, was stuck with more patronising lines than he deserved. He came across as a smart-alec folklore geek, though he did his best with the material. But it's a Hammer film, and their horror movies were pure entertainment, an adventure with a few spooky overtones. Mostly the Satanic manifestations looked cheep and comical, at least by modern standards, and Hammer have done much better.

With ""Rasputin"", they, and Christopher Lee, did do better. Given a complex story of an historic figure had to be condensed to around their usual hour and a half, the movie worked. Lee was at his best portraying the dissolute, self-seeking monk. ""Mad Monk"" is a misnomer - he was a political game player, and insanity would not have helped him succeed! He'd have survived well in a modern capitalist society, never mind Tsarist Russia.

At the price, you've lost nothing with this double pack. You may enjoy ""The Devil Rides Out"" but if you don't, ""Rasputin"" picks up the slack.",1292112000,,1187,4.813725490196078
959357,5,6305063486,"THE DEVIL RIDES OUT is a wicked tale of devil worship and black magic, brought to life through another commanding role given to the great Christopher Lee. In it, two close friends must stop the young Simon from dedicating his soul to the devil under the guidance of a satanic cult. Charles Gray plays opposite of Lee in role of the evil cult leader Mocata, whose mesmerizing stares lend to his chilling performance. DEVIL is filled with strong visual motifs that add to the implied terrors found within the picture. Hammer favorite Terence Fischer reserves his close-shots as a metaphor for possession and mind-control, while using the intensity of the lighting to demonstrate the presence of evil on-screen. A number of striking images also add to the overall effect and mood, including the horned Goat of Mendes that appears at the black mass, a giant tarantula, and the armored figure of death set atop a jet-black steed that attempts to break the cleansing ritual. Despite these ghastly apparitions, THE DEVIL RIDES OUT relies far less on its visual appeal than it does on its keen scripting, and the film succeeds most in its brooding dialog and winning performances.

959358,4,6305063486,"""THE DEVIL RIDES OUT"" (1968)

Christopher Lee is Duc de Richleau who is concerned when a young friend is absent from their regular reunion.  An investigation reveals the friend is trapped in a hypnotic-astrological cult led by a malevolent Satanist named Mocata (Charles Gray). In a desperate game of daring good and raw evil, Lee challenges Mocata with a powerful ritual that may or may not destroy his coven and free his friend.

This is terrific Halloween movie that raises all kinds of theological questions.

959360,5,6305063486,"_The Devil Rides Out_ (1968), made by Hammer Film Productions, is an adaptation of the 1934 Dennis Wheatley novel by the same name, which features a confrontation between the forces of darkness and those of light.  The film stars Christopher Lee as the Duc de Richleau, the main character in the novel and practicioner of white magic.  The rest of the cast includes Charles Gray as the black magician Mocata, Nike Arrighi as Tanith, Leon Greene as Rex Van Ryn, Patrick Mower as Simon Aron, Sarah Lawson as Marie Eaton, Paul Eddington as Richard Eaton, and Rosalyn Landor as Peggy Eaton.  The film takes place in 1930s London and begins with the Duc de Richleau and Rex Van Ryn paying a visit to their friend Simon.  It turns out that Simon has involved himself in a black magic ritual and together the Duc and Rex decide to rescue him along with the girl Tanith who they meet at his house.  While there they encounter a demon, but the Duc effectively destroys it with a crucifix after telling Rex to avoid eye contact.  Then, the Duc manages to knock out Simon and together with Rex they take him back to the home of the Duc de Richleau.  Thus, begins the action as the Duc attempts to combat the forces of evil represented by Mocata, the lead black magician.  Simon manages to escape and Rex decides to visit Tanith and take her away to the home of the Eatons.  However, Tanith escapes and together with Simon they participate in a Sabbat in which the Goat of Mendes appears.  The Duc and Rex manage to destroy the Goat of Mendes with a crucifix and thus take Tanith and Simon back to them.  However, Mocata is to pay a visit Marie Eaton and demonstrates his hypnotic powers.  Further, under extreme duress Tanith attempts to kill Rex so must be taken and tied up to avoid further danger.  At this point, the Duc creates a magic circle and various demons including the angel of death appear.  Tanith dies when the angel of death returns empty-handed.  Further, Peggy is taken by Mocata to be used in his rites.  The rest of the story unfolds as the group tries to re-capture Peggy and things may not be what they seem for Tanith either.

This film is a good adaptation of the novel by Dennis Wheatley.  Wheatley is perhaps best known for his occult thriller novels and this film effectively shows the dangers of tampering in black magic.

The director is Terence Fisher who consistently proved himself to be the best Hammer director. The film is gripping and if the special effects look very primitive now you should not let it detract from what is otherwise a great film.

Terence Fisher directs a riveting and intense ""fairy tale for adults"" in which darkness and light collide, and God triumphs over the Devil. The suspense and fear are effectively conveyed through Fisher's sharp direction, James Bernard's macabre and sometimes frenetic musical score, and Arthur Grant's brilliant lighting and photography, which comes into its own in the justly famous library scenes in which our protagonist and his allies must defend themselves against a nightlong satanic assault.",1102118400,,957,5.174193548387096

If you've ever read Wheatley, you already know what to expect.  If you haven't, The Devil Rides Out is a period melodrama (1920s) involving black magic and a Satanic cult.  Christopher Lee, in a rare go-round at playing the hero, is a cultured Duke who is an accomplished mystic and expert on the occult.  The son of a friend has been hypnotized and drawn into an unsavory Satanist bunch, who plan to steal his family fortune and do the poor fellow in.  Lee rescues the lad, and crosses swords with superior wizard Mocate (Charles Gray), a suave cad and powerbroker.  Trances, abductions, summoned demons and spells galore result.
This is as simple a melodrama as you're ever likely to see, more in the nature of a mediaeval morality play than anything else, though it performs like Agatha Christie.  What elevates it above the norm is the splendid production (though the effects are cheap) and a great cast.

Set in 1920s England, this film is different from Hammer usual fare with  low-budget special effects and a really cheesy Satan, who exudes bewilderment instead of evil. The orgy scene of the Black Sabbath is moderately amusing.
The drive to save the enthusiasm and energy of the young from the false lure of sexual freedom and power promised by Mocata provides for plenty of action and scares.

The Good

The Devil Rides out was directed by Terrance Fisher who was Hammers best and most reliable director. His work shines here as always.
The acting is consistently very good by the entire cast.
Its a real pleasure to see Chris Lee as a good guy. He is a great actor and it shows.
One of Hammer's best looking and most expensive looking productions.
Beautiful looking sets, props, buildings, estate grounds, wardrobes and cars.
An excellent story about the occult, Satan worshipers, saving lost souls and battling evil.
The screenplay by Richard Matheson is as always excellent! Matheson is one of the very best and never fails to deliver - whether a book, short story or a script.
Flawless picture, rich color, beautiful film stock and sound.
The Devil Rides Out is one of Hammers very best films and rivals Dracula, Revenge of Frankenstein and The Hound of the Baskervilles for story, acting and production.

The production values are terrific. A pity that the special effects weren't as sophisticated then as they are now. Then again they would probably sacrifice everything else just for the effects (a problem with so many current supernatural films).
The audio commentary is very informative and Lee is a delight throughout. He's full of interesting information about everything from the title sequence to the production design. A pity that Warner Brothers chose not to hire him for the audio commentary for The Mummy. Maybe they'll realize their mistake and hire him for Curse of Frankenstein and Horror of Dracula when they make them available (better get cracking guys Chris is getting up there a bit in age).
The extras are up to the usual standard we've come to expect from Anchor and Bay--great! I've always loved their reproduction of the lobby cards that they've included in the packaging. It makes each DVD a unique collectible. A pity Warner won't license Curse of Frankenstein and Horror of Dracula (they really should--they have so many titles to reissue that I'm afraid these two will get lost in the shuffle). Anchor and Bay could do a terrific job with these two titles as they have with all the Hammer titles they've licensed.",1003104000,6,1980,4.8753709198813056

959506,3,6305063486,"This Hammer cult classic can be enjoyed in two ways:
1. as a campy horror melodrama, with daft names, covens, black magic rites, absurdly solemn uttering of Tolkitsch, and risible special effects.
2. More seriously, as an investigation into the smug assumptions of Middle England.  Richleau is a very ambiguous hero - a devout Christian, he is versed in the black arts, homosocial (at least!), and seemingly anti-family.  The Satanists, with the their pagan evocations of Camelot, have more claim to rural England than the timid stockbrokers who now populate it.",986515200,2,562,5.164835164835165

The guys and gals at the Bay must really work their socks off presenting these Hammer Classics and this is no exception, a crystal clear and almost pristine print.  The master of Horror Mr, Christopher Lee gives us commentary, which is very informative.  He talks about his role as de Richleau(?), and the production of what must surely rate as one of Hammers best.  A trailer is included and an episode of 'The World of Hammer' series titled 'Hammer'. If you buy no other movies on DVD this year then please, please buy this one and enjoy the dark foreboding times of cinema before 'The Exorcist' became the parody of modern day stories of black magic and possession.",983232000,2,809,4.757142857142857

 For once Christopher Lee is cast as the hero, one Duc de Richleau, a change from the usual malevolent characters he always seems to play. The plot is very staightfoward, a friend of the de Richleau becomes involved with an satanic cult, being an expert on such matters he immediately realises the severity of his friends obsession. With the hep of his friend Rex Van Ryn (Leon Greene) they discover that this occult is overseen by Mocata (Charles Gray) and are determined to put a stop to it.  Such a plot is the usual staple of B-movie Devil worship shenigans but be prepared for some intelligent filmmaking of this genre. Director Terence Fisher plus Christopher Lee plus a good sreenplay plus good production values always yields a decent movie, this being a very good example.  With regards to Mocata (Charles Gray) a particular scene where he attemps to hypnotise his way into the ""Safe House"" is one of my favorite film moments.  Five stars to Anchor Bay for another excellent presentation. The presentation is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen viewing (1.66:1) and with a quite superb 5.1 Dolby Digital remastered soundtrack (Considering it was made in 1968 I suspect some artistic license was used in its production however the JAMES BERNARD score is very vivid and far removed from the usual mono recordings you would get on VHS).

959510,5,6305063486,"This is one of the greatest horror movies of the 60's.  The critic above who stated that this film 'wouldn't appeal to modern horror fans' is, sadly, probably right.  There's no MTV heavy metal music droning during some 'cool' escape sequence.  Jennifer Love Hewitt does not get to trill and squeal.  Even more painfully, most teenage viewers would be coming to this film without the benefit of a 24-hour MTV ad blitz to tell them that it was a 'cool' film to see at the local multiplex before going out for a pizza with their respective 'babes' and 'dudes'.  Hey - it gets worse.  Terence Fisher's directorial technique actually assumes some capacity for imagination and intelligence on the part of the viewer, Christopher Lee's performance burns with vigour and committment (as opposed to moping around in a state of apathetic irony, whilst occasionally deeming listeners worthy enough to thrill to some oh-so-witty Gen-X pop culture comment laboured over by Kevin Williamson - so witty, dude), and composer James Bernard actually seems to take this story seriously.
  Hammer Films reached various peaks in their two decades of film production, but THE DEVIL RIDES OUT is easily near the top of the bunch.  The film unfolds, step-by-step, like a great story, and Anchor Bay's disc, with Christopher Lee on the commentary track, is a treasure.",969580800,8,1344,4.99103139013453

959512,5,6305063486,"THE DEVIL RIDES OUT is Hammer horror at it's best and Anchor Bay's DVD is a gem.  Christopher Lee and Charles Gray battle it out (and put their all  into their roles) in a very entertaining satanic tale of good vs. evil.  Although some of the effects are dated and some of the dialog can invoke a  chuckle here and there, the film is still very solid and engrossing.  The  moment early on where the demonic spirit of a black man with glowing yellow  eyes appears is still very creepy and effective...easily one of the  scariest moments in any Hammer film ever.  So when the movie's creepy,  it's fun...and when it's a bit hokey or campy, it's fun as well.  The DVD  includes the US and UK trailers --- almost identical except the title of  the film and the UK trailer blacks out parts of the image (like the  spider)! There is also a commentary track by Christopher Lee and actress  Sarah Lawson.  Lee, who had a BIG hand in getting this film made at the  time, is understandably very knowledgeable about satanism-witchcraft,  Wheatley's book and the film itself.  It's an interesting track and a  great testimony to Hammer.  It is sad that Peter Cushing never had a chance  to do a commentary for any of his Hammer roles.

Director Tarrence Fisher  and Screenwriter Richard Matheson create a wonderful period atmoshphere;  and the supporting cast, including genre favorite Charles Gray, give  terrific performances.  The film, however, belongs to Christopher Lee who  brings much pathos and dignity to his role.  It is a shame more filmmakers  have not tapped into Lee's unlimited acting potential.

They were really fighting for the souls of  people, and you believed it. I really admire this film, because Richard  Matheson has taken Dennis Wheatley's story, pared it down, and made a very  tense film, that still manages to have at least three genuine moments of  terror - even after 32 years, and many viewings. Christopher Lee as  deRichleau (good) and Charles Grey as Mocata (Evil) make very good  adversaries, and the black magic elements are very believable and  frightening. I highly recommend this film, and suggest others who like it  check out the similarly themed Burn Witch Burn aka Night Of The Eagle  (1962).",957744000,,942,4.682926829268292

7881996,5,6305063486,"The Devil's Bride (a.k.a. The Devil Rides Out) is a Hammer Films joint from 1968, and are you so surprised that Christopher Lee's in it? It's a supernatural thriller that, for once, presents Mr. Lee as the hero, and he comes off well. This time, the terrorizing element is an astronomical society (cough***satanic cult***) against which Mr. Lee must put his best efforts in order to save the soul of a good friend. And he's got only 24 hours to do it - for the next day is April 30th, time of the true and Grand Sabbath, when disciples and fools can be baptized into the service of evil.

Lee inhabits the role of Nicholas, Duc de Richleau, well-versed in the occult and an intrepid man of action. His heroics are staged against the backdrop of 1920s England, so prep yourself for an eyeball of vintage vehicles and period costumes and mannerisms. This is gothic horror at its most brawny because Richleau and his game companion, Rex Van Ryn (Leon Greene), are both of the two-fisted persuasion and they don't at all hesitate at slinging haymakers at Eeeevil. From a more sedate front, Richleau also applies phials of salt and mercury to ward off the dark forces.

The Devil's Bride blisters along. It begins at a breakneck pace and doesn't let up. There are car chases and slugfests and hairbreadth escapes and sundry acts of derring-do. But it wouldn't be occult adventuring if there were no psychic possessions or sacrificial poultry or ominous pentagrams on the floor. And for the sake of cheap tawdriness, there is even moment enough for a nighttime woodland orgy.

The movie takes its cues from Dennis Wheatley's 1934 horror novel, The Devil Rides Out, a title that seems more apropos given one certain scene in the movie. Legendary novelist Richard Matheson - who wrote one of my favorite horror novels, I Am Legend - adapts the script. I don't know Terence Fisher from Carrie Fisher, but he executed some pretty boss directing here. He constructs a foreboding mood with stylish editing and the spectacular use of color. There are some gnarly images in this movie: the aforementioned orgy, that windshield cracking, the Angel of Death storming in... To me, though, the hugest selling point is Christopher Lee himself. It's such a contrast from what we're so used to seeing him as - he's routinely the big bad - that I continually had the giddy shivers watching him enact not only the hero role but the action hero role. This time, he parlays his saturnine mojo into great effect, lending his Richleau a sense of authority and precision and a certain cold swagger. Also, I'd like to mention Nik Arrighi who plays the much mesmerized damsel-in-distress Tanith, not because she did anything special - oh, she was fine - but because I freakin' adore this singular convergence of names. If I ever have a daughter, ""Nik"" and ""Tanith"" are tops on the list of names.

With purchase in mind, be aware of this product's region format. If you're somewhere in North America, this is probably a nuh-uh unless you have a Region-Free/Region 2 DVD player or a Region B/2 Blu-ray player.",1457481600,,3077,4.745794392523364
7881997,5,6305063486,"Great movie about satanic cults. We see some real events in this movie. In movies like Rosemary's Baby which came out the same year as this movie, everything is implied. We don't actually see any rituals or dark entities. In The Devil Rides Out, we see one of the pagan unholy festivals where the devil himself makes an appearance. We see a pentagram where red smoke appears and an evil entity appears and attempts to capture the unfortunate trespassers. Two prospective cult members are being forcibly rescued by Lee's character and supporting cast, and the cult leader has remarkable powers to telepathically communicate with them and get them to do things and even hypnotize them. Christopher Lee's character is well researched in the occult and he plays the part of a French nobleman well. we get to hear counter spells in ancient languages with the worry that reciting such spells may alter time and space! Very Lovecraftian. Good story, plot, characters, action, intrigue, enough special effects without overdoing it but making the movie truly supernatural.

7881998,4,6305063486,"I have often considered creating a drinking game to go with Hammer Horror films. Every time characters meet formally -- ""How do you do? Nice to meet you. How do you do?"" -- one takes a shot of liquor or a swig of beer. By film's end, you should have a nice buzz. Never has British formality been on display so much as in the 1968 Hammer Horror film ""The Devil Ride's Out"" (known as ""The Devil's Bride"" in the U.S.).

I have read about this film for years, a semi-cult favorite usually lost in the shuffle to the more popular Christopher Lee ""Dracula"" and Peter Cushing ""Frankenstein"" franchises. I was finally able to catch this unique Satanic horror thriller on Halloween night, a fun if rather silly ride. I'm not going to knock Hammer Horror films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hammer-Horror-Remembered-Updated-Edition-Updated-Edition/dp/B00ERYLIWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hammer Horror Remembered (Updated Edition): Updated Edition</a>), even if most were churned out in record time, a profitable assembly line of Gothic excursions fondly remembered today.

It was a bloody good time.

""The Devil Rides Out"" suffers from the same faults of many of Hammer Horror films of the era. It's talky and slow moving, with everyone greeting oh-so-formally. And of course, multiple chase scenes along the desolate back roads of Black Park, Wexham, Buckinghamshire, England (next door to Pinewood Film Studios).

But ""The Devil Rides Out"" is unique in that it is the rare showcase for Christopher Lee in a heroic role. It was also the first of many Satanic horror films in the late 1960's and early 1970's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-s-Baby/dp/B00003CXCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary's Baby</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B00124PXW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Rain/dp/B000GIW964/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Rain</a>). Lee is actually quite wonderful as Duc de Richleau, an educated aristocrat battling demons and death angels. He and his burly war comrade Rex (Leon Greene) realize their young protg Simon (Patrick Mower) has been recruited by the dark side, and Lee tries to shake some sense into the dumb kid for delving so casually in ""dangerous black magic!""

Simon is marked for Baptism into a Satanic cult led by the evil Mocata (Charles Gray), and soon the Duc and Rex are racing around Black Park in vintage 1920's automobiles while spying on rural rituals where the ""The Beast"" makes a cameo appearance. Mocata, when not splashing goat's blood on young women, evidently has great powers of hypnosis persuasion, and the Duc is forced to draw a huge chalk circle in the parlor for protection. They're in for a bumpy night as every monster with the possible exception of Freddy Krueger makes an appearance.

We lost Christopher Lee this year, an actor I thought would live forever (and he almost did). With more than 300 films to his credit (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-Misrule-The-Autobiography-of-Christopher-Lee/dp/0752859331/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of Misrule: The Autobiography of Christopher Lee</a>), ""The Devil Ride's Out"" was a terrific opportunity for him to face the very villains he so often played. Duc de Richleau is one of his finest and most sympathetic roles, an exotic, goateed, oh-so-cool expert of the dark arts battling the sinister phantoms of the world.
