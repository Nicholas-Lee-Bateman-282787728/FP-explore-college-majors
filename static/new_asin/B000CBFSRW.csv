8448213,5,B000CBFSRW,"Finding Your Way in the Wild is a tool to use to teach Map and Compass to both Boys Scouts and Boy Scout Adult Leaders. I use this video at the beginning of any Map and Compass or GPS class. For example, training adults can be a challange. For ten years I have taught new adult Boy Scout Leader Scouting. One of the three training new leaders take is called Introduction To Outdoor Leaders Skills. My staff and myself over the course of a weekend introduce all the skills a scout needs to know to become a First Class Scout. You have first to earn the Scout rank, Tenderfood, Second Class then First Class Scout. One of the session in this Introduction course is Map & Compass. This session is taught over two and a half hours. First I show the video Finding Your Way in Wild. It's a great intoduction to get things started. Next is pacing followed by a compass game then a short hike using a topo map with a orienteering style compass. It's a very comprehensive way to teach a very complex but important subject. The video Finding Your Way In The Wild is the only way to start the course.",1298160000,,1089,4.317073170731708
8448214,5,B000CBFSRW,I didn't know much about using a compass and have always stayed close to the maintained trails but a compass and topo are important for off trail hiking/backpacking and i was glad i got it it gave me the basics to take to an outdoor navagation class at my local REI. I didn't want to show up with nothing and i didn't have to have someone looking over my shoulder to make sure i wasn't getting the basics!,1282694400,,405,4.205128205128205
