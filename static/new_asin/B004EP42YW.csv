8486246,5,B004EP42YW,"i started with just 1 move with me / scooter & me dvd - then went to a series of 3 and then ended up getting all 9.  so i wish i had known how much my kids would enjoy these adventures so i could have bought this whole series first - and saved some money! all i can say is that they are a terrific way to get your kids exercising and having fun doing it.  i even join along sometimes and we have a wonderful time.  we've even started using some of the ""skills"" when we are crouchy or sad to feel better and not take it out on others.",1387152000,,533,3.7410714285714284

Scooter & Me: Heart Series - 3 DVDs for Calm Caring and Confidence
25-30 minutes each with Teacher'' Guide PreS-Gr 2
Move with Me Action Adventures 2010..'
Through story-based exercises, the instructor takes viewers through a warm-up, a story with movement segment, a relaxation exercise, and a skill review wrap-up on each of these DVDs. Viewers follow along with the fun yoga-like moves that perfectly complement the adventure story being told. The instructor and a small group of children giggle and smile their way through the exercises. Children pretend to be different animals and perform various movements as they listen to the tales of a boy and his scooter and the adventures they have together. Designed to encourage physical, cognitive, and emotional development, the program should help children learn how to channel their emotions through flexibility, strength, balance, and coordination exercises. In ""Tortoise, Hare, and Dragon,"" the concept of perseverance introduces ""elephant wisdom,"" a skill that helps the children focus on their auditory system, as well as ""cat wisdom,"" which concentrates on stress relief. ""Coral Reef"" deals with acceptance while encouraging youngsters to focus on their breathing and cross-motor coordination. ""A Beautiful Dream"" highlights relationships while revisiting all the skills from previous stories. The excellent guide provides background information on the series, detailed descriptions of each adventure skill, and tips for incorporating them into children's lifestyles. An engaging series for use at home and at school.

8486248,5,B004EP42YW,"While many dvd's for this age group focus solely on the fun factor, this series integrates creative play while developing vital skills for learning. Early childhood educator's and parents will consider this a gold mine of developmentally appropriate, brain-boosting content. Many pre-schools don't have the budget or access to skilled yoga instructors. Scooter & Me makes yoga and movement accessible to any school with multitudes of lessons and adventures to capture young children's imaginations and set them on the path to life long health. As an early childhood yoga educator, I am thrilled to see this series making it's way into school communities.",1323734400,,654,5.359223300970874
