You have got to see that movie because Police Squad parodies that movie to the hilt! I was laughing at this pretty decent film-noir because I was thinking of Police Squad! (In Color).  I doubt I've seen all 6 episodes and even if I did there is so much material in each one I'm sure I missed a lot of it in one viewing, awesome show!

There is more visual comedy than anything I have seen before.  If you enjoyed the Naked Gun movies, you will LOVE this series.  I only wish there were more episodes.",1160611200,4,296,4.051724137931035
2626386,5,B000H4JH80,"Leslie Nielsen was a dramatic actor in the 1950's-1980's tv and movies...That was until an all star satire  movie called Airplane.

Then the producers of Airplane did a TV show with slapstick, satire and well treaded jokes entitled Police Squad. It last only six episodes. The jokes were fast and plentiful. However ABC did not have the time to give it a chance and pulled its plug quickly.

Foreshadowing The producers took to the concept to the movies and lo and behold the Naked Gun series of films were created. Neilson became a comic actor

So if you are a fan of Airplane, Top Secret or the Naked Gun films, this set is great. If you want to recapture the original lightening in a bottle which was Police Squad, get this. And If you are like me-like cute crude humor..GET THIS SET!

2626387,5,B000H4JH80,"Police Squad! was doomed from the start. I mean, it broke too many rules for conventional TV, leaving the average casual viewer scratching his/her head at what was happening onscreen. The fact that the show was a comedy might've even gone unnoticed by a few folks if they weren't paying enough attention, due to the absence of a laugh track & the near-painful straight dialogue.

Maybe the show's quick cancellation was a blessing....it would've been awfully tough to maintain the same high level as these 6 episodes, which are arguably some of the funniest moments ever seen on network TV. Leslie Nielson was born to play the role of Frank Drebin, playing him even more deadpan & straight-laced as he did in the later Naked Gun movies. And to me, the dryer the better....the biggest payoffs come when Nielson is at his most stone-faced.

And on a somewhat refreshing note, there's no OJ anywhere to be found on these episodes, so you can watch 'em without the distraction of...well, you know.

Anyway, Police Squad! is a must own for any self-respecting fan of comedy. They'll never make 'em like these again.....",1158278400,12,1114,4.821989528795812

2626389,5,B000H4JH80,"I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD for many years now.  This is hands down my favorite TV series of all time - albeit a very short lived one.  As many writers have already noted, the entire ""series"" consists of only 6 episodes.  But rest assured that these 6 short episodes are packed with wit.  This is a show that you have to pay attention to - there are many visuals gags and plays on words.  It's fantastic.

I'm glad to finally have the chance to purchase this in a digital format.  As much as I liked the Naked Gun films, they just weren't the same.  For me, Police Squad will always be Leslie Nielsen and Alan North (with Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln, of course!).

If you're a fan of any of the Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker films (e.g. Airplane, Naked Gun, etc.) then you definitely should consider adding this to your collection.  It's definitely some of their best work in my humble opinion.",1155254400,102,911,4.401197604790419
2626390,5,B000H4JH80,"The three guys who created Airplane, Hot Shots, the Naked Gun, and other hilarious shows are finally releasing their greatest creation yet.  Police Squad was a failed television series that inspired the later Naked Gun movies and used many of the same jokes.  But here it is fifty times as funny, and not nearly as nasty or obseen.  Leslie Nielsen stars in the series as Frank Dreban and his comedic timing always shines through.  Watch for the scene in the boxing episode where the boxer screams out, ""Nobody owns Bobby Driggs, NOBODY"", and as he turns his back to the camera, on his shirt is printed the words ""Property of Martin"".  Shows don't get any funnier than this.  And while only six episodes were ever filmed, each one is so classic, you can watch them over and over again.  Pick up Police Squad, and you'll be laughing the whole night through.",1154995200,19,855,4.622516556291391
2626391,5,B000H4JH80,"Police Squad! is one of those shows that just didn't get the chance it deserved. The show skewered, among other targets, the Quinn Martin crime shows of the 1960's and 70's (The Fugitive, Cannon, The Streets of San Francisco, etc.). Leslie Nielsen, who had guest starred on many of the shows Police Squad spoofed, was hilariously perfect. With his deadpan delivery, it was a perfect follow-up to the career altering path Nielsen had forged with his performance in Airplane.

But as fitfully funny and clever as it was, Police Squad!, for some reason, couldn't pull in the audiences that had flocked to see Zucker/Zucker/Abrahams' Airplane just two years earlier. The series suffered from low ratings from the start and never found its audience. One of the running gags on the show was the introduction of a ""special guest star"" who was immediately killed off in the some horrible fashion right after the introduction. Lorne Green, William Shatner, Georg Stanford Brown and Florence Henderson were among the guest stars who were shot, stabbed, machine-gunned and poisoned. Unfotunately, the guest star for the sixth episode was John Belushi who died right before the episode was to air. ABC had to pull the show until a new introduction could be filmed. Right after that, the series was cancelled after just six episodes, cutting short the run of one of the funniest series of all time.

Fortunately, the team of Zucker/Zucker/Abrahams resurrected the Police Squad! series in the form of the Naked Gun series in the late 1980's. The premise, and Leslie Nielsen, finally got the exposure it deserved and the result was three hilarious films that did very well at the box office. However, when the three films were released on DVD, there was no corresponding release of the original series on DVD.

Now, finally, the original series is coming to DVD on November the 7th. Hopefully many will buy the DVD and realize what a crime it was for ABC to cancel this hilarious series so soon.",1154995200,137,1980,4.904477611940298

Alan North is his captain and when the two of them confer, they're assessments, suggestions and conclusions are often hilarious, but you have to listen for them in between the physical slapstick humor.

No?

Before your time? That's fine. It's not your fault, I'm not blaming you for the sad excuses for comedies that get peddled out nowadays.
Listen, just try out Police Squad, then watch the Naked Gun.
Yes this is a physical object and I'm sure you could just torrent it or whatnot but like, you may actually want to physically posses this. You'll look stylish and informed.

I know, it's tough. You've been lied to all your life. Cutting away to a flashback of a random celebrity doing something out of character is not a joke.
Police Squad has jokes. You may not know what those are, because most modern comedy scripts lack them. If you missed one the first time, don't worry, they will repeat them. It's broadcast and nobody was watching last week it's fine nobody will notice.

I love the fact that you have to see each episode at least six or seven times to catch each joke or sight gag!  I've owned this series for 30 plus years and it still manages to make me laugh out loud during each and every episode.  Leslie Nielsen is exquisite as Frank Drebin and the rest of the cast is just perfectly cast.  I love humor from actors that you normally wouldn't expect it from.

The end credits where they freeze is great. When it was cancelled i remember reading Kay Gardellas column in the NY Daily News saying good riddance. So when i saw the police squad movie 10years later out was like her getting the middle finger from the Zucker Brothers.  So pleased when i saw one of them listed on the credits of an early Family Guy which i asks watched from three beginning and which unlike my wife I get ALL the Jokes!,1398124800,,579,4.351851851851852

2626585,5,B000H4JH80,"After AIRPLANE's huge success in the summer of 1980, the filmmakers, Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker & David Zucker, produced six episodes of a half-hour cop spoof called ""Police Squad"" with Leslie Nielsen.  Four years later, they'd form a screenplay from this show to make THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF ""POLICE SQUAD,"" another monster hit and hilarious film.

The six shows here send up the basic cop show.  You can actually get on youtube and see an opening to an old Lee Marvin cop show called ""The M Squad,"" then see the same storyline lampooned in the first ""Police Squad"" episode in the same clip.  Funny, funny stuff.

In the later NAKED GUN films, Leslie Nielsen plays Lt. Frank Drebin as more of a comic figure, increasing the mugging and slapstick as the films go, but in these original shows, he's the rock-solid leading man giving laser-driven lines like he did that made AIRPLANE so side-splittingling funny.

The rest of the cast is perfect: Alan North as Drebin's frequently befuddled boss and Peter Lupus as Nordberg, an undercover cop who gets so caught up in his covers that he usually forgets the case.

This definitely needs to be between your DVD copies of AIRPLANE and the first THE NAKED GUN.",1396310400,7,1213,4.720379146919432

2626588,5,B000H4JH80,"One of the funniest shows of all time. It only lasted six episodes so most people don't remember it, but it spawned the Naked Gun movies and, in fact, a lot of the best lines in those movies were recycled from the short-lived Police Squad series. I loved the off-the-wall humor and I still catch things upon the third or fourth viewing that I missed before. Leslie Nielsen, as the bumbling Sergeant/Lieutenant/Captain Frank Drebben, was hilarious, in part because nobody had ever seen him in a role where he wasn't playing a heavy until Airplane and Police Squad. This show has a cult following, and I'm part of that group. I highly recommend this DVD.",1394150400,,652,4.678260869565217

So why did it get booted? As one critic noted, you had to watch it. So much of TV comedy can be watched casually, the humor is in the dialogue, not the actions of the characters. In Police Squad, so much of the comedy is in the behavior of the actors, not just in the dialogue. Not to mention, the numerous site gags. From the beginning of the show, where the announcer says the title of the episode, but the title on the screen is totally different, to the announcing of the guest star, who is killed off immediately. You have to watch it all. At the end, there's a ""freeze frame"" where supposedly the film stops, but in reality the actors freeze in position--until someone moves.

Since I'm a fan of the movies I had to get this too, and it really is a rare jem as another reviewer stated. It was a hilarious series that actually had some continuity between episodes; for example they named all the people they locked up at the end of each ep. What I don't understand is why only six eps were made? Most shows, even the unpopular ones, are at least allowed to pull off a half season, in the double-digits. There's also a lot of repetitive jokes, such as the cigarette one, that were funny at first but quickly lost their punch. Overall a great (mini) series and this disk even has some good extras.

2626635,4,B000H4JH80,"you'll have to admit, it's not often that a series, particularly one that was so fleeting, leaves such an impression that even the reason for it's cancellation becomes legendary. but then, what did people expect from the collective mastermind behind Airplane!?
the aforementioned explanation? ""you actually had to watch it."" it's still occasionally derided as one of the all-time great cop-outs, and would certainly of set a precedent for lame excuses if it were any other series. but as it happens, that is indeed the nub of the miscalculation here.
in a nutshell, Jim Abraham's, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker - who would earn a place alongside such comedy cinema iconoclasts as The Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, and Monty Python - had to learn the hard way that television wasn't their forte. what you ""actually had to watch"" was the team's trademark sight gags. a Japanese garden, for instance, consisting of Japanese people standing in flowerpots. or the chorus girl who asks ""mind if I change?"": she goes behind her partition and another actress entirely emerges. a viewer who was reading or doing the dishes at the time would miss altogether that there even was a joke, much less ""get it."" whereas the less casual medium of movies, with it's "" event"" feel, could better accommodate ZAZ's spectacular style.
but enough bitching about what went wrong. obviously something went right, or I wouldn't be recommending it.
as with the eventual movies, the heart of the series is the redoubtable Leslie Neilsen. much has been made of how Neilsen, long one of the Business' stock straight men or ""heavies,"" saw his career reinvigorated via comedy at an age when it should've been winding down. it was the part of Lt.  Frank Drebin that best demobstrated those newfound gifts, becoming his signature role in the process.
if anything seems ""off,"" it's because the other characters haven't quite fully developed. the only other actor to make the transition to the movies is Ed Williams as the squad's resident scientist. his basic function in the movies will be to ape Q from James Bond. here he moonlights as a less savory version of Mr. Wizard. in explaining water condensation, for instance, he describes one child's mother showering. and that's the LEAST creepy thing he says to a kid.
the chief later immortalized by George Kennedy is here played by one Alan North. they have essentially the same interpretation if not performance style. and Priscilla Presley's character doesn't even exist yet.
the big surprise is the character played by one Peter Lupus. Lupus is best known for his role on Mission: Impossible, but you'd frankly never guess from that show that he could be particularly engaging. there, his function was basically the heavy lifting. it was as if Peter Graves, Martin Landau, etc. were a band and he was the roadie. here, given character moments and punchlines, Lupus more than holds his own. he's positively personable in a way he never got to be on MI.
Lupus plays Nordberg, but he's not really the same character immortalized by O.J. Simpson. he's not quite as dense and not nearly ad accident prone, getting through the series without a single injury. there's also the fact that Lupus has never brutally murdered a wife. (at least as far as I know.)
much as is made of ZAZ's apparent incompatibility with the genre, they did manage to squeeze some juice from television conventions. you mightn't guess since so many of the same gags would resurface in The Naked Gun (to the point that it was even advertised as featuring ""mostly new jokes""), but there are a few japes herein that wouldn't of worked in a movie. take the habit of writing one episode title on screen while the announced announces another. or the (in)famous convention of the ""special guest star"" murdered at their introduction. the major running gag is that the shoeshiner from whom Drebin gets the ""word on the street"" is an expert on everything else as well. after Drebin leaves, he offers similar consultation to the likes of Dick Clark and Dr. Joyce Brothers. he's even asked by a priest whether there's an Aftertlife or not.
ultimately, I have only one grievance with the series, that one of the very dumbest ""comedy"" exchanges I've ever heard - ""cigarette?,"" ""yes, I know"" - is litertally, as the expression goes, beaten to death. WHY? Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker of all people should know that something which wasn't funny the first time is hardly gonna be funny the 68th.
but then, it's also an exceptional series where something as minor as that is the only real blemish. yes, the series and/or experiment is technically a failure, but it still laid the foundation for one of cinema's all-time great comedy franchises. and it'll certainly entertain the fans of said franchise.
after all, Frank Drebin WAS the Inspector Clouseau of his day.",1341878400,,4827,4.908200734394125
2626636,1,B000H4JH80,"I usually enjoy Nielson movies, but this one was is so silly that it ended up in my trash can.

2626637,5,B000H4JH80,"""Police Squad"", which spawned three hilarious movies, was brilliant when it first appeared as a summer replacement on ABC in the 70's.  This is a takeoff on all the cop shows of the day, including some that Leslie Nielsen was actually in.  When the show was cancelled by ABC, the executive gave the lame excuse that the show required too much attention to keep an audience.

I've seen the first three episodes many, many times, and I seem to find something new to laugh at with each viewing.  The second three I've only seen once, about twenty years ago, and I'm looking forward to seeing them again.  Not just the visual gags, like the gunfight taking place with the two participants five feet apart, and of course missing every shot, but the dialog really show the care and intelligence that went into crafting this gem.  (The police scientist doing the ""Mr. Wizard"" kids science show shtick is uproarious; ""Next week, Timmy, we'll learn why cows look forward to being milked."")

The late Leslie Nielsen really seemed to hit his stride when he left drama for comedy, and this was his follow-up to the Abrams/Zucker/Zucker Airplane! series, working again for them on the little screen.  He and everyone else on camera are blithely unaware of the jokes they're speaking, or living, and there are no sly winks to the audience.  It is played straight dead-pan, and completely seriously.

They then surprise her with a traditional ""Happy Birthday to You."" Funny? No. But, in the VHS version, they play a silly, stupid, song called ""Something Different"" which all the guests seem to know as a birthday tribute. It was hilarious. At least one other episode has a similar music change, causing the moment to move from side-splitting funny to mildly amusing.

I wonder if anyone else noticed that some of the music has been changed/updated since the VHS release?  I noticed almost immediately that Drebin's singing was substantially altered in episode 6, and in episode 3 (The Butler Did It), they actually sing ""Happy Birthday"" instead of ""Something Different"", as was sung in the original version.  Just a bit of trivia for the true die-hard ""Police Squad"" fans.

I won't review the individual episodes as others have already done this, only to add that the show is a hilarious send up of 1960/70s US cop shows, full of big old cars, plaid jackets with wide lapels, small guns, devious women, smartass cops, and a stereotypical scientist working behind the scenes to solve some crazy crimes. There are loads of long-running jokes which appear in each episode (Frank's driving, verbal trickery, frozen tableaux to end each episode etc). One of my favourites is when Frank and the lab guy enter the lab - the lab boy opens a door and walks in while Frank simply walks through a large opening beside the door. There is some fantastic inverted humour in the style of Monty Python, and earlier still, the Goon Show (UK radio show). My favourite is the following dialogue, when Frank turns up at the scene of an abduction;

Frank. Was there a ransom note?

Ed. Yeah, they tied it to this window and threw it into the rock garden. I've sent it over to the lab. They're demanding a million dollars.

Frank. Why are the lab demanding a million dollars?

All in all, this show is an absolute GEM. It is much better than the movies which are still funny, but too glitzy in my opinion - I much preferred the earthiness of Police Squad! The fact that they only made 6 episodes helps keep the quality very high. The actors all play their parts to perfection, especially Leslie Nielsen, and the writing is sublime.

This is probably the only DVD I own that I watch over and over again and still laugh out loud. I even invite my friends over to watch it - most haven't heard of it and almost invariably love it to death.

It was a dead on parody of classic shows like Dragnet, with a fair amount of movie parodies of Raging Bull,and others thrown into the mix.  A lot of the jokes you might not have even seen the first time around because they were cleverly hidden in the background, which forced you to watch it again to see what you may have missed.

2626698,5,B000H4JH80,"The only time in history where an unsuccessful television show gets the go ahead to become a successful movie franchise.  POLICE SQUAD failed, according to some, because it required the television viewing audience it's undivided attention to absorb all the jokes (verbal and visual). Remember, the creators of this show are the same people who brought AIRPLANE! to the movie screens. The show starred the brilliant Leslie Nielsen as Detective Frank Drebin who probably got the part because of his outstanding performance on AIRPLANE, and then reprised the role for the NAKED GUN/FILES FROM POLICE SQUAD films.  The show was released on VHS tape a few years back (on 2-separate video tapes).  Finally, the series (all six episodes) are collected on one DVD package. To this viewer, the show still retains the hilarity when it was first aired over 20 years ago. However, its the opening credits and the end credits of each of the episodes which are the most memorable. In each of the episodes, the opening credits there would announce a special guest star who is killed off as soon as their name is mentioned. Who can forget Florence Henderson being riddled with bullets as she sings ""Put on a Happy Face"" during a cooking show sequence, William Shatner being poisoned at a restaurant dinner sequence, and Lorne Green falling out of moving vehicle with a knife in his chest. Then, the end credits of each episode would parody all those sitcoms and dramas when the shows would end with a still frame of the characters of the program in various poses with the credits and theme music running.  POLICE SQUAD would do the ""still frame"" with the characters (usually taking place at the police headquarters office , but its not the film that is stopped, it is the actors themselves trying to stay still while various activites around them are still going on.  In one ending, as Drebin and his partner Ed (actor Alan North)are in a freeze position, a chimpanzee is jumping around throwing up the papers from the desks in the office. On another, a prisoner tries to escape and ends up trying go out of the tv viewers screen. Then, in a hilarious one, actor Peter Lupus (MISSION IMPOSSIBLE) as Norberg (played by OJ Simpson in the films) walks in on Drebin and Ed in their freeze poses and goes into several poses himself as the end credits and music are playing. These two concepts of the show (the opening and closing sequences) are what made POLICE SQUAD memorable and these concepts were never translated onto the big screen versions.",1169683200,7,2527,4.786697247706422
2626699,4,B000H4JH80,"Canadian-born Leslie Nielsen had television audiences laughing for a couple of months in 1982 with this buffoonery-packed short-lived series POLICE SQUAD. Nielsen is lieutenant Frank Drebin,who comes complete with gags. Alan North is Frank's partner Ed Hocken,who's the serious one compared to Frank and Officer Nordberg. The running time for these six episodes is much less than the three NAKED GUN films(inspired by this series) combined. Nielsen reprised his role in 1988 in the Paramount film THE NAKED GUN:FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD. George Kennedy played Ed Hocken and football great O.J. Simpson played Officer Nordberg. Two sequels followed,THE NAKED GUN 2 1/2:THE SMELL OF FEAR in 1991,and three years later,THE NAKED GUN 33 1/3:THE FINAL INSULT.",1169337600,,759,5.440677966101695
2626700,5,B000H4JH80,"Here it is - the series that spawned the infinitely more popular ""Naked Gun"" movies.  Because show was in the same time slot as ""Magnum P.I."" and ""Fame,"" the show's ratings were consistently bad.  Summarily killed after only 4 episodes on the air (and 2 more complete), the creators re-sold the idea as the Naked Gun movies.

Anyone familiar with those films, or, in fact, any films creasted by the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team (including Airplane, Top Secret, etc.) will know the type of humour.  Usually it's not sophisticated - the characters walk into streetposts, when a name ""rings a bell"" we hear a bell on the soundtrack, and the characters mishear words (""What's wrong with my little kiester?"" ... ""Keystore"").  The fact is, most of the jokes are juvenile if they are even funny at all.  But because they come so fast, and because visual jokes are piled on top of double entendres on top of running gags that go through the whole series, the sum total is that this is the funniest show ever written.  I have seen every episode many times, and still pick up new throw-away jokes (like famous buildings appearing as background through windows).  The performances are critical with this kind of comedy, and in Leslie Neilson, they found one of the few actors who could really pull the material off.  The entire cast are basically straight men to the jokes - they never mug for the camera or smile at their one foibles.  Instead, it's a show that you have to pay attention to because the deliveries are so understated, it's easy to miss the joke, corny though it may be.

The low price of this DVD is appropriate, considering most fans of the show will already have the VHS tapes, and newcomers are unlikely to buy it at a high price.  That's not to say there isn't material here of interest to the big fans who have practically worn out their VHS copies.  There are commentaries on half the episodes and some other minor extras.  The commentaries are somewhat self-deprecating - they are much harder on the jokes (admittedly, some don't age very well) than I would be, and oddly so, since it is exactly the same humour as they use in the Naked Gun films.  In fact, fans of the films will see lots of the same jokes first tried in the TV version.  Of the other extras, there are two of particular interest.  The first is an original list of 15 or so celebrity death cameos, many of which were never used, including the lost John Belushi segment where he is sent to ""sleep with the fishes in cement overshoes.""  Unfortunately, the actual film did not survive.  One segment that did survive was an unused ""freeze frame"" joke for the credits, were Frank and Ed are in court.  I won't spoil the rest of the joke, but suffice to say it's one of the most elaborate freeze-frame jokes.

So, pick up this DVD if you've never seen the show - the price is right.  If you are a fan of the show and already have the tapes, the low price of the DVD and the extras are probably worth your time and money.",1168905600,2,2994,4.5055555555555555

Here is a case of the TV executives believing their audience to be dumber than they actually are. Talk about 'dumbing down'...

This series was the precursor to the Naked Gun movies and in my opinion, this type of humour works better in the half hour format because it is much sharper and succinct.

Police Squad is, to my mind, one of the funniest U.S. television comedies ever.

The DVD only gets a four star rating though because of the ridiculous nature of the episode order. (They got the 'American Gothic' DVD mixed up as well.) Why don't the people who make these DVDs have any idea about the programme itself? OK, so the episodes are in air order - but they should have already learned how crazy TV execs are. Anyone who knows this series well, knows that there is a running gag at the end of the show which amasses each episode as they name the crooks caught each week.

It's a minor problem, but one worth noting.

The correct episode order is as follows:

A Substantial Gift (The Broken Promise)

Ring of Fear (A Dangerous Assignment)

Rendezvous at Big Gulch (Terror in the Neighborhood)

Revenge and Remorse (The Guilty Alibi)

How do I mark 10 stars?

My father always believed that laughter was the best medicine.

That would explain why 2 of my brother's died from tuberculosis, but that is another story.

I cannot tell you people how many time I have rented the 2 VHS sets at a blockbuster with my best friends, quoting lines and never getting tired of them.

I have been waiting for YEARS for this to come out on DVD and have bought myself and my best friend a copy already.

Nordburg was amazing in this one.  From his chain gang and ""cocain testing"" (shine little glow worm, glimmer, glimmer!)  to his role in the charades game with the mime:

""Oh, I love charades.  What are the teams?""

""Not now, Nordburg!""

""Theme from a Summerplace!""

I never understood why they went with OJ.  Plus the original Nordburg didn't kill his own wife.

Anyhoo... some of the best dialogue comes from the ""boxing"" episode.

Also, the kidnapping episode is a fav too.

Hell they are all good.

Even down to Zazoo Pits!

I always love Drebin doing the non-chalant ""nose itch"" before he is going to knock a gun out of a hand, or throw a punch.

Drebin is one of the funniest characters ever invented.

I fall off my chair everytime I see the ""kidnapping"" episode and the butler answers the door and Frank, looking at the party invite in his own hand asks him,

""Is this 284 Farbarnippits Road?""

To which the butler takes the invite and turns it over, because it was upsidedown.

Frank doesn't bat an eye and then says only,

""Maple Street.""

Before the left wing insurgents from Paraguay...no Uruguay get to you, you HAVE to buy this set.

This is GOLD.

If you liked Airlplane, The Holy Grail, Naked Gun, you will NEED this series.  Any reviewer putting this series down does not have that ""Airplane funny bone"" in him that allows people to really enjoy this series.

There is no laugh track, and you have to watch everything and the background to catch things.

""Married, one child...That didn't work out, so he married a full grown woman.""

...

Boxer: ""Mary's glasses!""

Drebin:  ""That doesn't mean anything I could walk down the street and buy these glasses anywhere."" (tossing them aside)

Boxer:  ""Mary's scarf!""

Drebin:  (tossing That aside) ""I can find those in any dimestore in town.""

Boxer:  ""Mary's toaster!""

Drebin:  (looking forelorn)  "" Oh...My.... God.""

Take the advise from the shoe shiner ""Johnny"" and buy with confidence.

I am sure I am boring all of you with my ""shorts"" from the series.

I laughed alot at that episode and was was crushed when it was the last episode of a marathon. Fast forward 10 years or so and now I have GOLD! or so I thought. I bought this dvd and watched it and it wasn't really that funny. I rarely laughed and it seemed the delivery wasn't even close to as good as the movie. The extra with Leslie Nielsens interview also had a great explanation of why the series was cancelled after 6 episodes and why this humor worked on the big screen in Naked Gun and Airplane. I think this series would have gotten better if it wasn't cancelled so early. I think the writers just hadnt hit there stride yet. Also did anyone have a little problem with the sound jumping up in volume every so often?",1163980800,,985,4.135416666666667
2626717,5,B000H4JH80,"This short lived six episode series from 1982 was of course the inspiration for the NAKED GUN movies, and I laugh every time I watch these delightfully zany six shows.  Leslie Nielsen is perfect as Frank Drebbin, the mentally challenged police detective, who is funny even when he isn't talking.  The late Alan North is hilarious too as his partner, and Peter Lupus (MISSION IMPOSSIBLE) is a revelation in his role as the buffoonish undercover man.

Each episode starts with a big name (then) guest star who gets killed, and the narration always gives a title that doesn't match the one on the screen.  There are so many minor gems of comic mastery it would be impossible to list them all here, but the sight gags and the verbzl pundits are classic writing.

I love this show and was sad it never had a longer run...thanks for the DVD you can rewatch them over and over again.",1163635200,7,876,4.554140127388535
2626718,5,B000H4JH80,"As I understand it, ""Police Squad"" was one of the most requested titles for release on DVD.  It's taken a while for it to happen, but it finally has!  It's great to be able to replace my VHS tape that I recorded the shows on almost 20 years ago during a ""Police Squad"" marathon.  Having now watched the DVD, I now know that for almost 20 years, I've been watching heavily edited versions of the show.  But not anymore!

Other reviewers have described the episodes, so I won't waste time doing that.  Suffice it to say, the show was ahead of its time as it really didn't become popular until it was made into the first Naked Gun movie 6 years later (and had two subsequent hit sequels).  But I was one of the few who knew in 1982 that it was a clsassic.  I always wondered why the show never worked on TV, but Leslie Nielsen probably explains it best in his interview that is included on the DVD.  He says that you actually had to pay attention and most TV is meant to be watched almost passively while doing something else.  And I think he's right.

So it's great to have these shows.  The extras are just so-so as the interview with Nielsen is too short and I don't think the commentaries give much to the episodes (especially the one commented on by Robert Wuhl of ""Arliss"" fame, who was a writer for the show).  Wuhl must say a dozen times ""I don't remember this.""  Might have helped, Bob, if you took 25 minutes to watch it before watching it for the commentary.  But I won't trim the rating.  It's the shows I wanted and have now received!",1163635200,4,1544,4.272413793103448
2626719,5,B000H4JH80,"Glad to see this outstanding TV series finally on DVD! I vividly remember watching the series when it ran back in 1982 when I was eleven years old and I made certain to not miss an episode. We'll never know how long the show could have sustained its quality because, as so often happens in TV Land, it was inexplicably cancelled after six episodes. It has always been a great mystery to me how better-than-average shows get canned, while mediocrity (Growing Pains, Full House, Who's the Boss) is allowed to survive. Despite the ostensible unpopularity of the ""Police Squad!"" series, the ""Naked Gun"" film that followed was popular enough to spawn two sequels. Go figure. This parody of the crime noir genre employs dry, deadpan humor as it rather astutely mocks the overly dramatic tone of its earnest counterpart. Unlike the films, which became increasingly slapstick and the cast eventually began acting like what they were doing was funny, the series is played with the gravity necessary to pull it off. Sure, some of the jokes and gags are repeated multiple times during the series and even carried over into the films; and why not? They were gems! I haven't laughed as hard at anything in a long time as I did watching this. All six episodes are included here and there are some decent extras on the DVD as well, making this an essential DVD.",1163635200,,1346,4.7076271186440675
2626720,5,B000H4JH80,"I won't actually describe what the ""Judy"" bit is and spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the episode, but when Police Squad was issued on VHS years ago, it was censored and replaced with other content (probably due to an issue with rights to the material). On DVD, it's back, along with the chain gang demolition of a drug dealer's car (""Goin' to Mississippi, Goin' to see Delilah""...) Leslie Nielsen's reminiscences are excellent...he gives the reason for the show's failure after six episodes as ""people don't actually WATCH TV...they don't pay attention, so they miss the gags."" He's right...this DVD is the equivalent of six highly compressed movies, with no filler and no fat. It's been a long time coming and it was worth the wait.",1163462400,7,737,4.811023622047244
2626721,5,B000H4JH80,"I remember Police Squad's debut in 1982 and thought, ""This is a sure fire hit""...well, what do I know?

Six very funny, very well made episodes of this series which spawned the successful ""Naked Gun"" trilogy are here along with notable extras such as;

Commentary on three episodes, two including the ZAZ boys (the creators) and one with co-writer Robert Wuhl of ""Arliss"" fame.

An interview with Leslie Nielsen, who remembers those days quite well.

A ""Gag Reel"", which is standard issue I suppose. The thing is, I didn't find the ""goofs"" to be near as funny as what made it to the show.

Two poorly shot ""tryouts"" of Alan North & Ed Williams for their roles in the series.  Needless to say, they nailed their characters right from the get-go.

A ""freeze frame"" that was never used in the series.

Production notes, tidbits, etc.

I must tell you though, the famous ""John Belushi"" death scene which was pulled from one of the shows before it aired (because Belushi had died) has not been included in this collection because it had been lost and will probably never be recovered.

All in all this is a well made DVD which captures a very unique show. For fans of ""Airplane!"" & the ""Naked Gun"" series, this is a must have for your collection.",1163289600,5,1241,4.574660633484163
2626722,5,B000H4JH80,"Police Squad! is beyond funny. It's hilarious. I never saw so many sight-gags, or heard so many puns in one show all my life. Only 6 episodes? What were they thinking? Arrest the nitwits who cancelled the show!",1162944000,5,210,4.552631578947368
2626723,5,B000H4JH80,"Yes, Police Squad was and IS still THAT good. No...great. Superb even.

Since I was a wee child, way before I knew who the masterminds of the brothers Zucker, Jim Abraham and Pat Proft were, I was enamored and floored by their amazing and unique brand of slapstick humor. Unlike the majority of spoon fed comedy shows and films, these guys made you find the jokes all on your own. This could be the reason that the humor eludes some and goes over the heads of others. But for those of us who took the time to look for the humor, we were rewarded in giant lump sums of tears from continuous laughter.

I was 6 years old when this series debuted on television. At the time, I remember short spurts of things outside of playing amongst friends. However, the gag with Leslie Nielsen driving the car from the back seat stuck out like a sore thumb for years until I actually found out what I had seen.

By now, most people already know that this short-lived series spawned three amazing films that go by the name The Naked Gun. For the completist or even for someone looking for a brand of humor that can never be found amongst the ""Everybody Loves Raymond""'s and ""King Of Queens"" of this world, Police Squad delivers a multitude of times and then some.

What makes this series and the movies that followed so special was that despite the fact that you were watching a comedy that was throwing jokes at you a mile a minute from every angle, every actor performed like the material was MacBeth. The deadpan seriousness of each characters face just served to add to how absolutely brilliant this show truly was. Only now are we seeing shows that attempt to come close to what this show mastered 24 years ago.

You don't need mine or anyone else's endorsement. If you like this brand of humor a la ""Airplane"", Police Squad is a no brainer.",1162944000,5,1830,4.450746268656716
2626724,5,B000H4JH80,"Finally, the Police Squad episodes (all 6 of them - ""In Color"", no less, like the opening annoucement states before the start of each episode) have made it to DVD.  Probably the funniest, short-lived TV show in history, ""Police Squad"" was the genesis to the three Naked Gun movies that followed more than a decade later.  These 6 shows contained some of the best comedic lines and sight gags in TV history (in this reviewer's humble opinion).  I challenge any viewer with a modicum of humor in their bones to watch any one of these episodes without laughing out loud within a few minutes of viewing.

""Police Squad"" was a satire of the famous Quinn Martin crime dramas from the late 60s to the 70s that were so popular.  Leslie Neilsen, (aka Captain Frank Dreben) is tremendous in his wonderfully understated way.  Alan North , as Captain Ed Hocken, is a perfect foil for Dreben's goof-ups.  Ed Williams, as scientist Ted Olson, deadpans some great lines of his own (along the line of pilot Peter Graves in ""Airplane"").  And....Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln - enough said!  A parade of guest celebrities get killed off at the start of each show, as well.  (Wouldn't you like to see William Shatner poisoned?)

One word of caution, though, listen carefully as you view the shows because the gags come one after another and take some thought.  This is one TV series that you will watch over and over again because it is THAT funny!

(What WAS ABC thinking when they cancelled this great show after just 6 episodes?)

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to any fan of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker movies (""Airplane"",  ""Hot Shots"", ""Top Secret"", and ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", just to name a few) and the Naked Gun series.",1162857600,4,1698,4.747440273037543
2626725,5,B000H4JH80,"Put this alongside the great Tick live action show.  A must have for comedy fans.

Best dialog:

Bad Guy: Who are you and how did you get in here?

Dreben: I'm the locksmith... And I'm the locksmith.",1162857600,3,199,4.297297297297297
2626726,4,B000H4JH80,"This show is still very funny even now. Classic gags like ""A hunch won't stand up in court Frank"", ""No sax before a fight"" and ""Cigarette?"" ""Yes I know"" are complimented well by a wealth of background jokes that you may not spot on a first or second viewing. My favourite episode is the one with the mime, but these are all good. Only one complaint and that is that because so many of the gags are good they were used again in The Naked Gun movies so they might seem a little old to someone watching this for the first time. All good fun though.",1162857600,6,545,4.150943396226415
2626727,5,B000H4JH80,"Glad to see this finally getting official release.  I taped it off a late night marathon awhile back, and it's great -- more consistently amusing (particularly in 22-minute bursts) than the Naked Gun movies (though the first movie was pretty good, albeit by recycling some of the gags from the series).  Most memorable line:  Leslie Nielsen, acting undercover as a locksmith, breaks into the bad guy's apartment.  The bad guy yells, ""Who are you?!  How did you get in here?!""  To which Neilsen responds:  ""I'm the locksmith.  And... I'm the locksmith.""  If you find that funny, buy this.",1161907200,14,587,4.908163265306122
2626728,5,B000H4JH80,"Finally it's here, ""In Color""!  And for those who didn't get to see the original run on television, you will find many of the quips and gags in the Naked Gun trilogy are straight from the files of ""Police Squad!"".  In fact, you really have to pay attention as the gags and jokes come non-stop.  Here's one recurring gag; in episode 1 Drebin hits a trash can with his police car. In episode 2 he hits 2 trash cans and so on.  ""Cigarette? Yes I know!""  ""No sax before a fight""!  ""The 'toe' truck's here"".  ""Club Flamingo"".  (lol)  Where do you stop?

Great fun for everybody with Det. Frank Drebin, Capt. Ed Hocken, Johnny the Snitch, Ted Olson, Scientist and what I though was the best later edition appearing in the last 4 episodes, Peter Lupus as Norberg. (He should have played Norberg in the movies).  After all those years playing the serious character 'Willie' on Mission Impossible, he gets to display his comedic talents as well.

Returning soon to a television screen near you!

Rest In Peace Leslie Nielsen: You will be missed... 11.28.10",1161388800,39,1047,4.594594594594595
2626729,5,B000H4JH80,"In 1980, the movie ""Airplane!"" hit theaters and went on to become one of the biggest box-office hits of that year. It also put the movie's creators on the map. Jim Abrahams, David and Jerry Zucker wrote and directed ""Airplane!"", which now ranks as one of the funniest movies of all time. For their follow-up project, they decided to go to the small screen. And in 1982 they created a comedy series titled ""Police Squad!"" While ""Airplane!"" was a spoof of disaster movies (most notably the ""Airport"" movies of the `70s), ""Police Squad! was a spoof of cop shows. As for who would be the star of the show, Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker decided to recruit one of their actors from ""Airplane!"", Leslie Nielsen. For years Nielsen had been regarded as an actor who usually appeared in serious roles. But ""Airplane!"" would eventually change all that. It was in this movie that Nielsen got a chance to do laugh out loud comedy, and ""Police Squad!"" would take him to the next level.

Nielsen plays Lt. Frank Drebin, a cop who's so dumb that he doesn't even know it, and what follows throughout the series run is a collection of clever wordplay, bad puns, silly names, hilariously stupid jokes, and visual gags going on in the background behind the main characters. Also it shows the characters taking it all so seriously with the actors (including Nielsen) playing it with deadpan faces. This is exactly the same approach that Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker used for ""Airplane!"" It worked for that movie, and it worked with ""Police Squad!""

""Police Squad!"" is one of the funniest TV shows ever made. The show debuted on ABC on March 4, 1982 to rave reviews, but unfortunately not many people watched it when it first aired. It only lasted six episodes and ABC eventually cancelled the series. But what followed next was unbelievable. The show gained loyal support and a cult following, and it would become known as a successful failed television series. It became a hit after it was cancelled, which is something that rarely happens on TV. But after I watched the six episodes for the first time many years ago, I could see why people like this show a lot. It's so uproarious and so hilarious and so funny that I can't understand why the show lasted only six episodes.

Let me count the ways on why ""Police Squad!"" cracks me up every time I see it. The opening credit sequence to every episode, boy what a hoot! It starts off saying ""Police Squad! In Color"". Then the voice-over announcer introduces stars Leslie Nielsen and Alan North (playing Capt. Ed Hocken), followed by Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. Then were introduced to the episode's special guest star. Once the guest star is introduced, they're immediately killed off, and that's the only time in the episode that they appear. This is a very interesting twist to the show, and it's also very original. And finally each opening credit sequence ends with a story title on the screen completely different from the one the announcer says. Then throughout every episode you see lots and lots of goofy jokes, both verbal and visual. For instance, when Frank and Ed visit ""Little Italy"", you see the Roman Coliseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa appear in the background. When two bodies are removed from the scene of a crime, they are taken out on a stretcher thirty feet long. When the cops question a grieving widow about her deceased husband, they have the perfect answer to her complaint about being bothered at such a bad time. ""We would have come earlier,"" they explain, ""but you husband wasn't dead yet."" You also get lines of silly dialogue, such as when a character asks another character ""was a man named ""Twice"" shot once, or was ""Once"" shot twice?"" And isn't that an Olympic-size swimming pool upstairs at police headquarters? The closing credit sequence to every episode uses a familiar TV technique, that of freezing the action in the last scene to act as a backdrop for the credits. Here the performers do it literally, standing stock still trying desperately to hold their open-mouthed expressions through the closing roll.

""Police Squad!"" is a comic gem of a comedy series that deserves all the accolades that it has gotten over the years. In 1982 it received two Emmy nominations: one for Leslie Nielsen as Best Actor in a Comedy Series, and the other for Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker, who received their nod for Best Writing in a Comedy Series for the first episode. Even though this series was short lived, it did not die. In 1988, Nielsen reteamed with Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker to make a feature film based on ""Police Squad!"" The name of the movie was ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!"" The film opened in December 1988, and went on to become a big hit with critics and moviegoers alike. It was so successful, that two sequels followed: 1991's ""Naked Gun 2 : The Smell of Fear"", and 1994's ""Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult"", which (like its predecessor) also scored big at the box-office. In the summer of 1991, shortly after ""Naked Gun 2 "" opened in theaters, CBS decided to cash in on the ""Naked Gun"" franchise by airing the episodes of ""Police Squad!"" And the show was a big hit for years on video.

Now it's finally coming to DVD on November 7, 2006. It's about time! I know the biggest fans of ""Police Squad!"" (myself included) will be getting this DVD. I can't wait!",1161129600,16,5374,4.676532769556025
2626730,5,B000H4JH80,"I agree with everyone that this was a great series, but many people think that the network pulled the plug on this. Not true! Back in the old days of television, the networks often filmed a few ideas as ""summer replacement"" series. They only intended to broadcast a summer's worth of shows and that would be the end. Remember that ""Donny and Marie"" started out as a summer replacement show along with several other shows. It would have been nice, but I bet the Zucker brothers would rather be making movies!
