7730261,4,B01E55GE9Q,"Here's another live release of Mr. Hackett after a couple of Genesis revisited show, this time, it's
the celebration of 40 years of ""Voyage of Acolyte"" and the release of the ""Wolflight"" album. The
concert starts with the intro of ""Corycian Fire"" and open with the old track ""Spectral Morning"".
It's disappointing that we can see and hear this complete song only in the extras in the videos
section. ""Love Song to a Vampire"" has that attractive melody getting you hook immediately. In ""Wolflight"",
 we can witness the confidence that Steve's voice has acquired in the past years.
""Weel's Turning"" show heavier guitar sections before an acoustic set of 2 songs beginning with a
personal song from Steve dedicated to his wife : ""Love and Sea"". It's followed by an acoustic
version of ""Jacuzzi"" with his brother Jon on flute. The second set of the show is the Genesis songs
starting with ""Get' em Out by Friday"" with a Nad Sylvan voice that is spot on so as Gary O'Toole's
voice. Ronnie Stolt is on bass, being the first instrument he played in his life, so that was not
something new for him. The surprise came with the rare interpretation of ""Can-Utility and the
Coastliners"" and ""After the Ordeal"". My review is based on the Blu-Ray, so my rating will include my
appreciation of the overall experience of that 2 hours and 40 minutes show. If I compare this live
release from the previous release, I will say that a little more attention has been given to the
visuals. The sound and, the camera work are excellent. In the extras, you should take a look at the
three videos from the new album that are impressive. The Behind the scenes documentary is what you
expect with some repetitive answers in the band's members interviews. I rarely give a 5 stars
rating on live releases, because it's a new interpretation of previously old songs, so this is a
solid 4 stars.",1470268800,,1863,4.6454545454545455
7730262,5,B01E55GE9Q,"6 Stars on this one. the rating system should be changed.
This is the best concert blu-ray ever
..people are writing me arguing that this sounds bad because of excessive Bass.  ....I am using Thiel 1.7 speakers ($4000) and have 2 Subwoofers, a 10"" front-firing and a 12"" down firing. Sounds as awesome as can even be imagined !
Hackett deliberately has moments of great bass... hence several standing ovations because this music literally engulfs you and challenges ALL of your emotions. it is near Spiritual how empowering it can be.
I guess most of the bad reviews are from Millennials who are using cheap earbuds.
BTW: The Genesis Revisited dvd used to be my favorite, even more-so than Hammersmith, which I hated watching because of the heavy use of gel lighting coloring everybody's faces. This Total Experience disc is much better in every way. Now my favorite !
My favorite concert Disc that I own.  ...and trust me, I own a lot !!!",1469836800,23,939,4.719512195121951
7730263,5,B01E55GE9Q,"This a an absolutely outstanding release.  The video quality is crisp, and the colors are rich and saturated without being cartoonish, and the contrast is perfectly balanced to reveal detail even in the darkened auditorium.  The DTS audio mix is very well executed, with great clarity and richness.  The surrounds are predominantly used for ambiance to great effect, and occasionally instrument FX flutter through them for some tasteful immersion.

The performances are what you expect: Top-notch. The band plays with great energy (the keyboardists stoicism may be forgiven considering who he's emulating in the second half) and their precision is occasionally so tight that one might suspect some post-production cheating had it not been demonstrated live continually throughout the tour.

I haven't watched the bonus documentaries yet, but this disk is more than worth the purchase on the strength of the main feature alone.  In fact, this is one of my favorite concert disks of all time already at day one.",1467072000,12,1009,5.236024844720497
7730264,5,B01E55GE9Q,"Awesome concert! Sound, lighting, musicianship - all stellar.  I had the privilege of seeing the Steve Hackett band live recently and this video at least comes close to re-presenting that transcendent experience.",1493164800,,212,5.625

7730266,5,B01E55GE9Q,"Steve Hackett is the real deal. Whether he is playing early Genesis tunes or his original songs he displays sensitivity and dynamics that is lacking in many rock shows. He is not afraid of playing slow sensitive songs or to morph into wacky hard edged segues that at times don't seem to make sense but all of a sudden you get it. His songs are slick yet complex in the arrangements yet many times melodic and soothing. He always has top players and great song list. You might want to watch this show in a few segments if you don't have the time. If you have the time sit back and enjoy a greatly enhanced sound and video experience. Steve Hackett is not for everyone but if you like early Genesis and complex rock arrangements, there is no reason why you shouldn't like this show .

7730269,5,B01E55GE9Q,"I saw Steve and his band on this tour in Buffalo NY. This Blu-Ray is as wonderful as the live show. As the only former member of Genesis, Hackett is the only one that will go back to his roots and play music from his roots.

His solo material is just as compelling.

Highly recommend this Blu-Ray.",1486944000,,297,4.192982456140351

7730274,5,B01E55GE9Q,"This is a great concert. If you like Hackett's stuff, you will love this. If you love genesis' seventies stuff, you will love this.
The video clarity is very good for those of you hung up on those kind of things.
The audio quality is very good for those who are into that.
I saw some reviews stating too much bass in spots. I did not find that to be a problem. There are maybe two spots where the bass pedal comes in resonably loud, but it does not seem out of musical context to me, and even if it did seem too loud to you, it is only a few brief seconds over the course of over two and a half hours.
The song selection is great as a look at the cover or track listing will show.
Nad Sylvan does a very good job with the vocals and I don't think Peter Gabriel fans will be disappointed.
So what you have here is a great concert with great musicians and quality all round. If you like this style of music and you like watching concert movies this show is hard to beat.",1483315200,2,968,3.9948453608247423

7730276,5,B01E55GE9Q,I have purchased nearly all the Hackett DVD catalog and while I would not say this is the best of those performances the camera work and the image quality are stunning! Makes you wish all of Steve's video were available on Blu-ray.,1482710400,,231,4.523809523809524
7730277,5,B01E55GE9Q,"The new standard in concert Blu-ray.

First of all, this is the BEST looking concert disc I've ever seen. I don't know if it's shot in 4K, but razor sharp is a good definition.
Second, the sound is simply amazing. I have a multi-hundred watt 5.1 system, with a big sub, and my smile was indeed wide. The warm clean sound enveloped me. Congrats to the technical team responsible for this release. If you're a Hackett/Genesis fan, you need this Blu-ray!",1480896000,4,451,4.567901234567901

7730279,5,B01E55GE9Q,Most excellent. It's a pleasure to see the complex arrangements of the early art rock Genesis brought up to date with modern recording technology. And even more a pleasure to see Steve remain relatively true to the spirit of the original pieces. It's worth the entire disc just for The Musical Box.,1477958400,2,298,4.75

7730281,5,B01E55GE9Q,"One of his best so far.  Wonderful recording except for the bass drum and toms are a bit muddy at times.  Would like a little more punch at times.  Exceptional singing and playing from all musicians!!  John Hackett was a great treat on a flute accompaniment to an acoustic version of Jacuzzi.  Like his new album a lot which he plays some select songs.  From the Genesis periods I really enjoyed Get 'em out by Friday and Can Utility and the Coastliners.  But then Icarus Ascending was exceptionally great!  Singer does a great job.  The guy has incredible range.  Never heard that live before.  So glad Hackett continues to tour and write  One of my all time favorite composer and performer.  The guy gets better and better.  More polished than ever.  My first concert of you was with Genesis, Wind and Wuthering back in 1977 in Milwaukee, WI.  Wow that was wonderful too.",1476144000,3,873,4.607843137254902

7730285,2,B01E55GE9Q,Maybe it is just me but I found this music kind of boring! I enjoy lots of music from different artists and I just could not believe that I could not get into this artist's music.

7730291,5,B01E55GE9Q,"Another great visual performance of Steve Hackett's Wolfight/Genesis tour. I got the Blu-ray this time around instead of the DVD version just to see the difference. All I can say is that is STUNNING, the music and the Blu-ray quality. I was keen on the Wolflight tracks, there is so much depth in the music from that album and its even better live. One particular track I am having a fondness for is Loving Sea.. I also like the Jacuzzi version he did with his brother John. Steve has always put on a great show and it gets better every time. This time around for the Genesis tracks he played almost a whole different set of songs that were not played on the previous two tours which was nice to hear something that hasn't probably been played in years. Also, the bonus stuff is great with a documentary and rehearsal footage plus videos from the Wolflight album. Great package all round and worth the money.",1471651200,12,908,4.509090909090909
7730292,5,B01E55GE9Q,"Steve Hackett, while he has experimented outside the genre, has remained true to his progressive roots. This recording along with his ""Genesis Revisited"" performances is an echo of the golden era of progressive rock. The musicianship, the imaginative poetics, it's all here. Recommeneed for any progressive rock fans and especially for fans of early Genesis, Yes, ELP and King Crimson.",1471478400,4,385,5.433333333333334
7730293,5,B01E55GE9Q,"An amazing concert celebrating 40 years + of Steve Hackett's abilities, musicianship, melodies, memories, and an amzing body of work from progressive sounds. I really love the RAH and the Hammersmith bluray and dvds, but this new concert brings so many other greatest songs like Cinema show, Star of Sirius, A tower struck of down, etc. If you love classic progressive rock, this would be great adition to your colection, from who I believe is the most prolific guitarist and songwriters from ex Genesis band, along maybe with Peter Gabriel.

But I guess it's an ego thing with Hackett and Steve Howe's Yes, to not give the singers full presence. But that's a minor gripe. A great DVD.",1498435200,,313,4.709090909090909
