I think this was a nice blend.  It speaks of architecture but also of history and culture.  I didn't know that Aztecs had aqueducts just as the Ancient Romans did.  The work said the Aztecs had predecessors called the Tepenecs.  They made floating farmlands called chinampas.  The interviewees were diverse: women/men, Anglos/Latinos, scholars from colleges of several regions.  Peter Weller is the host and there's something so strange to me about Robocop, though I'm sure he's a nice person.  The narrator calls the Aztec Empire ""the greatest of the New World"" and ""the Venice of the Americas.""  The uniqueness of the empire is emphasized in this work.  This installment does make me curious to see more installments in the series.",1435276800,,913,4.986754966887418
