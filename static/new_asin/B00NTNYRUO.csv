6679833,4,B00NTNYRUO,"Usually sequels are pale comparisons to the original.  However, ""Singham Returns,"" is a pleasant exception.  The plot moves well.  The inane silliness is kept to a minimum, and the crime fighters are even more righteous (and sinister) than they were in the original.  You will find yourself cheering for a suitable end to the ""bad guys.""",1430697600,,337,4.964285714285714
6679834,3,B00NTNYRUO,"This movie does suffer from a certain sequelitis.  More biggerer! More badderer!! 1000% more explosiony!!! 10000% more gun fights!!!!  (Must equal more betterer, right?)

Spoiler alert.

I loved the first movie, but in this one we've lost the hometown hero feel of the original.  The musical number at the end focuses on ""now I've lost it!"" as if that was the reason why we all loved Singham to begin with. It wasn't *just* about what happens when he lost it, but the reasons and everything leading up to it. It's fun, but I feel like the highlight is misplaced. Plus, it seems like every time someone's phone rings there is a whoosh to realize it, a whoosh to pull it out, a whoosh to answer it and a whoosh to put it up to their ear.

Also, this one isn't funny at all. Original Singham had moments where the slow-motion caused the audience to cheer like ""OH HERE IT COMES!!!"" and you brace yourself. This one has fewer moments like that. Not one single belt-whipping! What?! No more Belt Cop?!

Regardless of what I think, it's essential viewing for Singham fans. I've watched it twice and it was better the second time around. Side note: this character should be in the Expendables.",1429660800,,1186,4.566037735849057

6679842,5,B00NTNYRUO,"The last fifteen minutes of the previous Singham had the best movie monologues of any movie in recent times. The amazing scene in which Prakash Raj vents off in front the entire police force was easily one of the best final fifteen minutes in the history of Indian Cinema. I get a smile each time I think about that scene. The movie was not bad either - it had great action, good music and the first time I loved a Rohit Shetty film. I watched Bol Bachchan again just the other day and loved it. This brand of cinema which is over the top, rapidly paced that something exciting is happening every ten minutes is a product that Rohit Shetty has almost perfected.
Singham returns is another popcorn with cheese but it is a well made film almost 2 hours and laugh hours the pace never lags. Ajay Devgan returns to his signature role and does a great job as he plays a action hero delivering kicks and punches throughout the movie. Kareena Kapoor is wasted as his girlfriend. The plot is very simple, as Singham investigates the murder of a policeman, the clues lead to the nexus between a sleazy god man played by Amol Gupte and his partner a sleazier politician, Zakir Hussain. Despite the weak plot, the movie is engaging because of many brilliant sequences. Primarily set in Bombay, the action revolves around the city and there are some fantastic action scenes on the Worli - Bandra sea link and the Reay Road area. Singham was a great movie because of great dialogues and many witty one-liners, the sequel has the same. Of course there also the many car chases, crashes and well choreographed fights which make the movie a signature Shetty movie.
And wait for the end credits- the song is very good.
Singham returns is a rehash of many movies but still very entertaining. You might say this has been done before, but before you say that remember, Rohit Shetty does it slightly better.",1412294400,3,1886,4.566371681415929

8680155,2,B00NTNYRUO,"Being a tenuous fan of films that come from india, im certainly curious about what they create, but also apprehensive due to not knowing what is good and what  isn't.  But that's a given with anything really.

Anyway, I came across the original singham film on Netflix , watched and bought my own copy and absolutely love it.  When i heard about the sequel, I was curious.

Then I actually watched it.  While it's great seeing Singham in action again,and the villains are interesting in their charlantanism, but the profound lack of continuity between this film abd the original film is problematic.

The actress that played the love interest from the First film doesn't come back, and as far as the sequel is concerned she may as well never have even exisyed, which is an insult to the well constructed love story that occurs between them, including the awesome musical numbers shared between them.

This  film  brings in a new love interest , who is played quite well by Bollywood icon kareena Kapoor.  And While the chemistry between her and Singham is good, its not as charming as the chemistry shared between Singham and Kavvy  from the First film.

In addition, the musical numbers don't contain the same level of sweeping romance as the First film, the comedy isn't as charming and  genuinely funny as the First film and feel far more typical and sitcom like.

And while the action is typically over-the-top, this time it feels more over-the-top by hollywood standards.  In the First film, Singham rarely if ever used a gun and preferred to fight with his fists, his wits, and his belt, but here he whips out his gun far too often.

I'll definitely check out other films made by these actors, but Singham Returns is definitely not one I'm anxious to watch again... ever.",1479168000,,1777,4.717532467532467
