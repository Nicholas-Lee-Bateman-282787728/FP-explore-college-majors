6480643,5,B00LE36FZ6,"This dvd set is FAR superior to the American two sided disk set. They don't skip or freeze up like some of the episodes do on the American version, and the 14 disks are stored very well indeed.

6480644,5,B00LE36FZ6,"Received the set yesterday, and just finished Disc 1 season 1 ""The Galaxy Being"" - therefore my assessment is for this one experience. For me, it's as good as I hoped for - and then some. The episode starts out with the ""Control Voice"" telling you all that it controls. I didn't remember just how much it controlled, but its a lot! The video and sound quality were better than expected. The packaging is just right, one very cool outer box holding three DVD cases neatly in their places - all plainly marked as to their content. If all the rest of the episodes are as good as this one, I couldn't be happier with this set!",1425427200,24,622,4.3247863247863245
6480645,5,B00LE36FZ6,"I decided to take a chance and purchase this Australian edition (region 0) of the complete original series of The Outer Limits, after seeing the outrageous prices being asked for even a used copy of the American release. I'm here to tell you: BOY! Am I glad I did. Not only is the packaging very cool - with a 3D changing image on the outer slipcover - but it also consists of 14 single sided discs, rather than the 7 double-sided discs in the American release. There are no booklets giving facts about each episode, but most fans of the series will know many of these details already. At less than half the price, this is definitely the way to go.",1424131200,205,648,4.363636363636363
6480646,5,B00LE36FZ6,"I stumbled on this show as a child while it was still being telecast in the 1960s The opening for each story was enough to scare me yet compel me to watch each episode. I believe this was an amazing series which should have been supported for a significantly longer duration. Considering the limited budgets, I believe most episodes still gave their message, and would cause one to wonder who else shares the universe with us and the possibilities for parallel universes as well. I was always mesmerized by this great series and recommended for those who believe we definitely are not alone nor do we really have achieved a great knowledge of our surroundings even now 50 years later!",1423958400,,684,4.708333333333333

6480651,4,B00LE36FZ6,"The discs come in three plastic snap cases. The discs play fine.

The original The Outer Limits (1963-64) has some brilliant episodes, but I decided to give it four stars. The first reason is Im not a big fan of black and white shows. The second reason is I like series that feature the same main characters with story and character arcs that connect all of the episodes and take you on a journey. The third reason is the same problem I have with all of the Twilight Zones and Outer Limits and X-Files shows and that is that the episodes are hit and miss. If you're a science fiction fan who doesnt appreciate horror you have to wade through a lot of horror episodes to get to the stuff you love, and often the series and episodes are incorrectly labeled by information sources.

For example, the original The Outer Limits is labeled as fantasy, horror and sci-fi on IMDb. The second The Outer Limits (1995-2002) is labeled as drama, fantasy, and horror on IMDb, with no mention of science fiction. Most of The Outer Limits (1995-2002) episodes are horror, but The Light Brigade (1996) episode is an example of an outstanding sci-fi story, but its incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror on IMDb instead of sci-fi. Quality of Mercy (1995) is another example of a great sci-fi episode incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror. Star Crossed (1999) is a third example of a sci-fi episode incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror. All of the episodes in The Outer Limits (1995-2002) are labeled the same so if you're a sci-fi fan you cant pick and choose just the sci-fi episodes to watch on Amazon, unless you have a great memory or took notes if you watched the show before. The discs that have been put out for the second The Outer Limits are either of poor quality or overpriced.

The original The Twilight Zone (1959-1964) is labeled as fantasy, horror and mystery on IMDb, but the show has some terrific sci-fi episodes. The second The Twilight Zone (1985-1989) is labeled as sci-fi, fantasy and mystery, but I didn't see a lot of sci-fi. There were only a few episodes in the show I found memorable: Cold Reading was brilliant and hilarious. A Day in Beaumont was a wonderful fifties era science fiction alien invasion tale reminiscent of shows like The Invaders (1967-1968). The Cold Equations is a classic science fiction story. And Cat and Mouse was enjoyable, with a funny ending.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1522627200,,3715,5.003236245954692

6480655,5,B00LE36FZ6,Awesome science fiction series that would absolutely suck you in from the first episode. Great work with a very slim budget.....especially in the final season. When I watched this when I was like around 11 or 12 my young mind was blown at how scary but cool it was. Episodes would have me thinking off and on about it all week in school or anywhere because the stuff they used in the episodes would remind me of certain episodes. Just a great  great series.,1519948800,,457,4.440476190476191
6480656,5,B00LE36FZ6,"The packaging for this release specifies Region 4, for Australian consumers and PAL video format.

This release is in fact Region FREE (0), and is in NTSC video format.
Puzzling.
I don't understand why the reason for mislabeling.
There is mounting evidence of a quiet Region Free movement and this release is another example, one of many in my collection.
My LG UP870 4K player has a working PAL~NTSC video converter when needed but is a restricted Region 1 & A device and it plays all the DVDs in this Outer Limits collection.
My little SONY player will NOT play any PAL format discs, regardless of region and it too will play all of these discs.
I also have a Multi Region PANASONIC player so I am well versed in foreign releases, I have many very rare titles.
Freedom Of Choice is a wonderful thing!

The video quality of these Outer Limits DVDs are EXEMPLARY, they are High Definition restorations and are very near to absolute perfection!
I know Bluray is the best format possible but these discs are too good to replace, I will probably never bother with a Bluray release.
Most DVDs upscale very well, but this can't be said for all. It really depends on the quality of the data processing.

There are many wonderfully intelligent stories here and very thought provoking, the episode titled Zzzzz is a Sci-Fi fantasy/fairy tale about a bee queen who assumes a beautiful human form. She has insect mannerisms of course but seems autistic, it inspires sympathy.
This episode was shot in a special process that softens focus on the outer edges and areas of brightness have intense sparkle. It's reminiscent of the 1935 film, A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Very expressive!

I don't know if I can say anything that will add to the relevance of The Outer Limits, it is an enigmatic phenomenon of tremendous historical value.
It could easily be the greatest television series of all time, but I don't know who has the authority to say so.
I love it for what it is, a wonderful collection of intelligent, inspired science fiction allegories that were meticulously produced.
The loving attention exerted to make these productions the absolute best they can possibly be is so impressive, they are Art.
Cinematography for this series is unique and innovative, very expressive.
I have a great appreciation for classic special effects, this I think, is why the film Blade Runner is so noteworthy.
There is something very real and special about actually making something happen instead of using CGI effects.
Of course back in 1963 it was much more difficult to get the right effect one wanted but the people who made The Outer Limits were willing to make the best effort possible and WOW, does it show.
Overwhelmingly so!

A most influential phenomenon indeed and it still shows, it is magnificently timeless.

A beautiful fascination and a great comfort, I do love it.

6480657,5,B00LE36FZ6,"Enjoy every minute of it. Yes, there will be chapters that are less exciting than others, but I like it. Now, you have to have in mind that this is a series done in the 60s and would I dare to say, that no big budget one (i.e. ala Stranger Things), so if you are looking for out of this world special effects, well, you won't find them. But having said that, and taking in consideration the time it was done, these are respectful ones.
One thing that I like the most is to see some figures/actors that with time became house-names in the movies and tv industry (i.e. Clift Robertson, Robert Culp, etc...) in their youth. Some of them already were famous, but some were starting their career, so it is nice to see them.
As well, it helps the viewer to have an idea of the issues that were the most prominent worries on that time, like the constant shadow of nuclear annihilation. Even some of the subject are in vogue today, like the contact with extraterrestrial life, but the interesting thing is the way that the same are approached and treated.
So, if you are a lover of the old movies/tv series, and you like sci-fi, give it a go. Even if you liked the Twilight Zone, you may find this one of your liking. Personally I liked this one more, but that is matter of tastes...:).
With regards to the quality of the video and sound, it is there. Of course, no ultra high resolution 4K UHD, but played in my Blue Ray/DVD upscale device, the image is neat and clear. I like the option given in the beginning of each episode, to go to a scene of it by showing a picture of the beginning of the same. Would be nice if you just could have the option of ""play it all"" rather than having to come back to the selection screen to choose which episode to play, but that is just nit-picking. Still a five start for me.",1519516800,,1805,4.25

6480660,4,B00LE36FZ6,"This brief series presented some truly fantastic and exciting stories back in the early 60s. It focused exclusively on science fiction stories. Robert Culp was in the pilot and other episodes. Sydney Blackmer played a politician and his crazily created double in the 2nd episode.

This black and white series was remade in the 90s as other shows like it have been updated.  Bill Shatner was in one memorable episode as were many other guest stars like Martin Landau, Leonard Nimoy, Tim O'Connor, and so many others.

No special features just the episodes running over 51 minutes.  This was a Region 4 release, but played fine on my cheap blu ray player from Wal-Mart.",1518048000,2,667,4.824561403508772

I did see where the Editors note said it was an Australian Region 4 release, but I go by the STATS  and the fact that Amazon didn't post a REGION WARNING when I went to order it.

However, I thought this was an excellent opportunity to get the series on one-sided discs that would be easier to handle.  The video and audio quality is pretty much the same as the 2002 edition, which is very good.  I played a couple of episodes one after the other on the same DVD player (Sony) and television (Samsung 48"") for comparison.  The series hit the airwaves when I had just reached 12 years old.  I was really impressed and, keeping in mind the special effects limitation and budget for a television show in the early 1960s, it still holds up well.  Of course, on a high definition television and high quality DVD player, some of the wires and such used in some episodes show up.  But bear in mind that on a black & white tube television in 1963, it was never noticed.  This series had some real classics and few clunkers.  Get it and watch it, it's worth it to see how real SiFi came to television.  I would love English subtitles, but neither this set or the 2002 set has them.

6480710,5,B00LE36FZ6,"The Outer Limits is one of the best shows ever produced for the small screen. The episodes hold up well and anyone who grew up watching them has them firmly imbedded in their minds. Watching this series now I was amazed at how many of these episodes I remembered. The other worldly creatures once distant memories in my mind all came back to me in vivid memory.

I owned the original 2 volume U.S. sets and I had no problems with the double sided discs, but I am not a fan of them as they are unpredictable. The U.S. set has episode guides, this does not, but that certainly isn't enough reason to down grade my rating of this set. This set is well worth buying for fans of the show, I actually sold off my U.S. versions and replaced it with this set as I much prefer the singled side discs and holders of this set.

This box states it's region 4, PAL, but my DVD/Blu Ray player played every episode without a hiccup. The discs are housed in three cases most of which contain hinges with a single disc attached to each. In the third case a couple of the discs are stacked with one over lapping the other, which is slightly irritating but nothing to get upset about. More importantly is the fact they the producers of this set didn't cheap out and try to squeeze more episodes on to each disc to save money. In fact, the last disc only holds one episode and two of the other discs hold only two. The remainder hold four episodes each. I'm not sure why they didn't opt to put three episodes on two discs instead of using three discs for 2, 2 and 1 episode, but I suspect it was to even out the use of the case holders. Regardless, it is nice to see the episodes looking very good and in uncut form.

If I had any complaints is that I wish they would have found or produced some features for this set as I think fans would have loved to hear some behind the scenes information or just some reminiscing by some of the wonderful guest stars. If you're a fan pick this up, it is much better designed that the original U.S. version. Note: my set didn't have a lenticular cover like some have posted, maybe they only did a short run with that cover, it's not a big deal to me, but just in case your expecting it, it may not be on the set you purchase.",1491350400,,2243,4.175519630484988

6480727,4,B00LE36FZ6,"A time-remembered classic TV series.  The original Outer Limits was the best in it's class.  They tried to resurrect the series 2 more time, but they were not the same.  This original series version is the only version that a true OL fan would want to own.

First I want to reassure all of those who are considering buying this particular packaging from our friends in Australia.  The box clearly says it is for ""Region 4"" which is Australia.  It also say the video format is ""PAL"".  But I can reassure everyone that this series is region free and plays perfectly in my American region 1 DVD player.  So have no fear and buy it, it will play fine for you too.

The DVD's are in 3 volume packages but contain the full 2 seasons.  The #1 and #2 DVD cases contain 4 discs with their own holder trays for easy and safe access to each disc.  However, case #3 contains 6 discs with stacking.  If you remove them with care, there should be no problems.  I though this could have been avoided with a case that contains flip trays.  But there are no paper or cardboard sleeves to scratch up the discs.

Each episode is shown in their original full time frame with nothing edited out.  They are complete episodes they way they were first originally aired.  Even the opening of each episode has the full original 1 minute speech about ""...we are controlling your TV"".  The picture quality is excellent and the sound is Dolby Digital 1.0 (Mono) and sounds great through my home theater system.

Shock Video comes through once again with a top quality reproduction of a series on video.  This is how all TV series should be done.  Thanks again to our friends in OZ for offering what our American studios won't.",1488499200,8,1697,4.462540716612378

6480730,1,B00LE36FZ6,"I had vague memories of this series from my teens (early/mid 70s) so I decided to revisit it, and now I know why it's vague. A bad series. The droning march of the announcer's voice, the painfully laborious dialogue, the reliance on husband/wife dialogue and marital relations and slow camera panning to carry through 50+ minutes of episode time (perhaps their biggest mistake), the cheezy creature costumes... All through the series (every episode practically) I kept saying to myself ""thank g-- for fast-forward"", and ""make it stop"" on the dialogue! No joke! In the 1st season, one episode ""the sixth finger"" was mildly interesting. The 2nd season, 3 mildly interesting episodes. ""zzz"" had a cleaver take, and ""children of spider county"" was possibly and early seed idea for the 90s ""Roswell"" TV series, and ""specimen unknown"" had a predictably cleaver ending (though a good candidate for mystery science theater!). 3rd season started to to hone in on the formula. More episodes were mildly interesting, with one standout for the whole series - ""the inheritors"", 5 star. That one approached the quality of ""The Twilight Zone"". For ""The Outer Limits"", go straight to season 3. Then go straight to ""The Twilight Zone"" entire series. They got it right. While they had their share of bad episodes too, they had a lot that ranged from decent to outstanding. By the way, if you do order this OL DVD, it say region 4 on the back cover, but plays fine on my US dvd/blueray player.",1487980800,,1474,4.853174603174603

6480749,5,B00LE36FZ6,"Some technical details about these Discs.

I put one of the discs into my Mac Pro tower and it told me everything about the discs.

They are NTSC, Region 0, (a.k.a. All Region).  29.97 fps,  Screen size: 720x480, Double layer discs.  These disks should play fine for anyone that made the mistake by not purchasing a multi-region Blu-ray/DVD player.

The whole Region System is an invention of evil Hollywood in a useless attempt to prevent piracy. Instead, it ONLY makes things more difficult for honest consumers.

These disks are pressed, not burned, so they should last a very long time.  The old-fashioned burn discs are only good for 5 to 7 years. (The burnable M-Disc will last a 1000 years.)

Obviously, a wonderful television series. I would not put it on the same level of the original Star Trek, but nevertheless very good indeed. The quality is about as good as you're likely to find.

The information on Amazon's website does show these to be NTSC, but the packaging itself says that they are PAL and R4 (Australia) this is wrong.  Spend a little bit more and get a multi-region DVD / Blu-ray player and you won't care.  I have an Oppo multi-region Blu-ray player that will play ANYTHING, PAL or NTSC.

It looks like the transfer was done from 35mm. I have several vintage movies from the Criterion Collection and the quality of this transfer rivals that. I was truly shocked at the quality and sharpness of a modern flatscreen, it was stunning in some shows. That's the good news.

The bad, or is it expected, news is that the shows in this series are so BAD as to make you sorry for the actors. OMG, watching these is really painful but at times humorous. Fortunately I didn't become a TV critic. I do love watching  some of the early B&W TV shows and having watched way over a hundred episodes of Twilight Zone I can say that IMHO I can say that the worst episode of Twilight Zone is better than any of the first 30 or so Outer Limits.

6480796,3,B00LE36FZ6,"As others have posted, this Australian DVD set is an improvement over the U.S. regular MGM/UA releases.  The picture is brighter and the sound is better, due I'm guessing to Shock Video having used using single sided discs instead of the double sided ones that MGM/UA originally used.  That being said however, the problems resulting from MGM/UA's refusal to do this series up correctly remain in this improved release.  Some shows were transferred from the original negatives and look superb, examples being ""The Hundred Days Of The Dragon"", ""Controlled Experiment"", ""The Special One"", ""Production And Decay Of Strange Particles"" and ""The Probe"".  Others, however, were made from archived original broadcast and syndication prints, and therein lies the problem.  The quality of those old prints varies greatly, and even some of the ones that looked fine on VHS and laserdisc for some reason did not transfer well to DVD.  Examples are ""The Architects Of Fear"", ""A Feasibility Study"" and ""The Chameleon"".  Compare those three shows with the five I mentioned before and you'll see the difference in quality.  Nothing short of going back to the original negatives for pristine transfers will ever fix those episodes.  Why would you do such a patchwork job on a project so important to so many baby boomers?  I can think of at least two reasons, time and money, and not enough of each to do a proper job on this classic old series.  The packaging is also improved over the original DVD release, but one thing I noticed was that in each of the three snap cases, the leaf holding additional discs inside had not been installed, and I had to do it myself.  Pretty sloppy workmanship.  Another curious thing was that all the colorized photos on the case inserts were taken from second season shows, with none from the first season.  As the first season of The Outer Limits is unanimously considered superior to the seventeen second season shows, that would seem to be an odd way of promoting a product.  I hope this is not the final improvement we'll get for The Outer Limits, and that the show will finally come out on Blu-ray, which should resolve the picture and sound issues.  But I'm doubtful it ever will.  At least some of the shows now look the best they've ever looked on home video, but others actually looked better on VHS, which others have noted.",1456790400,21,2352,4.810945273631841
6480797,4,B00LE36FZ6,"Though I love the (original) series, I only rate this 4 stars - due to the lack of any extra material. The video itself seems excellent for all episodes (or, at least the best that could probably be accomplished with the original source). Still, I feel some commentaries would have been a nice addition, as well as subtitles. I might have rated this 5 stars, except the price I paid (for essentially a bare-bones set) was about $80.

As for the series itself - this is one of the first which I can remember watching on TV as a kid in the mid to late 60s (though possibly/probably it'd already been syndicated - I'm not sure) - with the iconic ""Control Voice"" combined with that classic title sequence (which does vary a bit, but the prime elements are there). Some very excellent science fiction stories were adapted, and I would (arguably) say this is the best science fiction anthology series on US television during the 60s. Inspired probably by the 1950s series ""Science Fiction Theatre"" and also by the success of ""The Twilight Zone."" Some may argue that the latter series was better - and they'll get no argument from me. However, as I mentioned - ""The Outer Limits"" was geared for the science fiction genre, while ""The Twilight Zone"" covered many different areas. Also - though in today's world, some may laugh at some of the special effects and makeup work in this series - this actually seems very well done (especially for something dating back a full 50+ years).

On a side note: volume 3 contains six DVDs, of which two contain only 2 episodes, and the final disc only has one episode. I personally think that all 17 episodes could have been placed on 5 discs - still leaving room for some sort of extra material - maybe scripts and/or original story .PDF files.

One final note: the discs are quite easy to remove - a little bit too easy, though. I've struggled with other cases using hard-plastic - which almost scares me when it seems like I might damage/break a disc while removing it. However, the cases used here are of a soft-plastic style. Unfortunately, that means they may be prone to coming loose during handling - and in fact, when I opened the package a couple of the DVDs were loose - as well as one small piece of plastic having been broken off.

Still - Overall I'm more than satisfied with this purchase (well - the price I paid did seem a little high). I'm very happy to have this sitting on my shelf, next to ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""Science Fiction Theatre,"" and ""Night Gallery"" (three other excellent anthology series').",1456272000,3,2550,4.5855263157894735

Regardless of my emotional attachment to the show, I really do think it is great entertainment. Some of the stories are actually very deep and touch on deep philosophical questions.

6480837,5,B00LE36FZ6,"The Outer Limits is one of my all time favourite science fiction shows.  It's simply incredible and was so well written (kudos to Leslie Stevens), with some of the most amazing effects that still excite even today.  While the obvious period of the 60s is highlighted here, the actual stories are timeless.

What I find myself most amazed about is how gripping it is.  Take the original Star Trek series for example.  While I still enjoy most of the episodes and don't mind it, compared to the Outer Limits it's purely just filler entertainment.  The Outer Limits is simply incredible and thought provoking.  It's terrific that the entire series is now available in pristine condition on DVD.

When I first saw the Outer Limits about 20 years ago, all that was available where a handful of episodes on some rather worn out VHS cassette tapes.  Even still I recall enjoying each and every episode immensely.

Fast forward to today and we are presented with a very impressive 14 DVD set featuring each and every episode in stunning clarity(only fitting as we all know only 'The Outer Limits' should be controlling the transmission).  The box the three cases are housed in is well designed and the superb lenticular cover is a great addition.

The set does feature a couple of negative points, nothing I am going to reduce my rating of this fine series and excellent transfer to DVD on but here they are for the collectors and fans out there like myself.

1. On the back of the box set cover, it meantions 'three seasons' of The Outer Limits.  This is incorrect as there were only ever two. (How I wish there was a third season though). Attention and care to details matters to fans who ultimately will be the ones purchasing the set.
2. Absolutely zero special features or Easter Eggs.  This was a little dissapointing.  I would have thought The Outer Limits was worth adding at least 3 Interviews with surviving cast members of the crew or actors on the final disc of the set(which features just a single episode).
3. The colour splash for the menu was perhaps not inline with supporting the black and white of this original series but that's just me.

In conclusion, this set is very well received by this fan.  I've read that prior sets were double sided and featured very hard to distinguish side A and side B markings.  Not so with this set which features very nice single sided picture discs all nicely stored in very good trays which hold the discs well.  The transfer to DVD is magnificient and if there are no plans to bring out any special features perhaps for a Bluray release, then in all honesty there's no point for a Bluray release as the episodes are as pristine as I believe you could get footage of this age.  That said, science fiction fan favourites such as the Quatermass movies have all been released on Bluray and feature some very nice footage, so if Shock was to release a Bluray set and plaster it in special features(Interviews, Stills, Photos, Notes, Set and Costume design pdf's etc), then I would be there, otherwise there is nothing further to gain, which is a shame as this series truly deserves more.

Without doubt, 'The Outer Limits' was one of the most influencial Science Fiction series of all time and you will be dazzled at the amount of ideas thoughout the series.  Ideas which have no doubt spawned much of the Science Fiction ideas of the present since it's inception.

Amazon has been my go-to store for the last couple of years, and I haven't been disappointed yet.",1531008000,,275,4.75
8665390,5,B00LE36FZ6,"This edition is exactly the same as the one released in about 2007-2008 (with 4 episodes on both sides of each DVD) only this one just has 4 episodes per disc.  Menus are the same, quality is the same.  The roughly $50.00 pricetag is also not bad at all for the 2 1/2 seasons/49 episodes.  I don't think they're Region 1 DVDs but they work on US DVD players.  I notice most of the other editions are very expensive.  Buy this one - this is the one you want.",1529971200,,457,4.089887640449438
8665391,5,B00LE36FZ6,"This is where my love for scifi started.  I started watching this when I was 9 and I think it still holds up today. Don't pay attention to the region 4 on the box. It plays on my computer, my dvd player and my blu ray player perfectly. Good price.",1529798400,,247,3.94
8665392,5,B00LE36FZ6,"One of the truly great SciFi shows of all time. What I loved about this show is they did not have the budget to rely on dazzling special effects, so they dazzled us with great story telling. One of the most well written shows of all time. Can you tell I enjoyed and am enjoying the series? The pre CGI effects are often down right cheesy but the story is so engrossing that one does not mind. Great guest stars as well, names such as Robert Culp, Geraldine Brooks and a pre U.N.C.L.E. David McCallum.

Obviously created trying to capitalize on Twilight Zone's success, the series gradually carved its own nitch and became its own entity. Gripping stories ranged from the most popular ""The Zanti Misfits"", and the contemplative ""Architects of Fear"". I highly recommend this series if you love old school pre CGI scifi.",1529020800,,817,4.63448275862069
8665393,5,B00LE36FZ6,"Episodes are unedited and uncut from the the original series .  some DVDs only have  2 episodes . Generally there are 4 per DVD. There was one that had only 1 episode. Season 1 was broadcast on ABC from 1963 to 1964 at 7:30 PM Eastern Time on Mondays. Season 2 was broadcast on Saturday at 7:30 , 1964-65.  So it was surprising that it had a PG rating. It is no more violent that Westerns or other Si-Fi shows at the time. It is B/W , has 3 sets of DVDs not organized by season , but are order of original broadcast, you can't click on play all. had trouble with the first DVD of set 1 , but the rest were ok. Since,the Outer Limits both old and new are no longer being broadcast cable/satellite/antenna it was welcomed.. It is mild  compared to today's fare.",1528934400,,759,4.142857142857143
