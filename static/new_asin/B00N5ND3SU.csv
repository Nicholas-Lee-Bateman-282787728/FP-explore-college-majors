8676413,4,B00N5ND3SU,It is a silent movie with written dialog from the 1920's. It was made by the French and it is extremely biased that way. Even so it is about the only film avaible about the Battle of Verdun so I guess it will have to do.,1490140800,,220,3.8043478260869565

8676415,5,B00N5ND3SU,Great dvd on the Battle for Verdun where the Germans pretty much bled the French Army white during WW1. This was a war where technology was much more advance than the tactics utilized by the combatants and their leaders. Casualties were in the thousands for a good 4 years. Carnage was the rule of thumb. Slaughter en masse.,1447632000,2,324,4.603448275862069

8676417,5,B00N5ND3SU,"This old French made film better explains the battle of Verdun than anything on film in the last 97 years. Its a fictionalized ""docudrama"" but with maps and explanations and outstanding film work using French soldiers that actually were in the battle.",1426204800,8,251,5.0
