8613618,5,B00FA2DEDI,"Fun DVD, as usual. I'm a big Frontier Doctor fan and these episodes are pretty good. I swear I saw the two on the DVD I was missing somewhere before - The Desperate Game and Apache Uprising - but I don't have them in my collection already. The transfers on his DVD were better than many of the others from Oldies.com",1459123200,,316,4.19672131147541
