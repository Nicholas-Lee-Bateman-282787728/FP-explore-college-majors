5100152,4,B007NPME5Y,"Taking a hint from the recently released second half of Season 1 of ""Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated"", ""The Looney Tunes Show"" finally wised up and did likewise.  The last 14 episodes are on two DVDs for you to enjoy whenever you want featuring all your favorite Warner Bros. characters in a whole new setting.  Some of these episodes include:

""Newspaper Thief"" - Daffy Duck suspects that one of his neighbors is swiping the newspapers off his front step.  So when Bugs Bunny organizes an apology dinner party for the neighbors, Daffy leaps into action to find the culprit.

""Bugs and Daffy Get a Job"" - Bugs goes to work at the office with Porky Pig, while Daffy gets some work done on his face.
First appearance: Dr. Weisberg (Although he's an original character like Tina Russo, he, too, became a recurring character in the series.  Plus, he kinda resembles a bit like Dr. I.Q. Hi from the ""Duck Dodgers"" series.)

""That's My Baby"" - Daffy is forced into babysitting no thanks to Tina, and Bugs sees that Porky is gullible to any and every given offer.

""Off Duty Cop"" - After meeting his TV idol at a book signing, and realizing he's nothing but an actor, Daffy Duck goes into being a real off-duty cop with Porky by his side.  In the B-story, Bugs goes into a frenzy from giving up coffee for an energy drink he bought from Yosemite Sam.

""French Fries"" - As football season approaches, Daffy becomes rather upset on account of Porky taking his share of fries.  (Seriously ?)

""The Shelf"" - Bugs wins the Nobel Peace Prize.  Now he needs a place to put it, and boy is it frustrating !

""Muh-Muh-Muh-Murder"" - Daffy thinks that Porky is a wanted man - er, pig - and tries to turn him in.  Also, Bugs tends to Lola Bunny who broke her leg.

""Point, Laser Point"" - Granny's cat Sylvester finds a new obsession over chasing Tweety Bird in a mysterious red dot.  As for Granny herself, she accompanies Bugs and Daffy to spend a little time together.
First appearance: Wile E. Coyote (This is the first time we see him in the series itself other than his CGI spin-off.)

And let's not forget all the Merrie Melodies music videos that are worth getting down to like, ""Yellow Bird"" starring Tweety and Sylvester, ""Skunk Funk"" starring Pepe Le Pew, ""Giant Robot Love"" and ""Chintzy"" both starring Porky and Daffy, and a very special song called ""Daffy Duck the Wizard"".  Also, there are more disasters in the desert in ""Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote"" shorts such as ""Vicious Cycles"" where Wile E. pilfers some motorbikes to catch Road Runner, ""Remote Out of Control"" where Wile E. uses an RC car in that episode, ""Shut Your Trap"" which involves a glass cage that finally catches Road Runner, and ""Another Bat Idea"" where Wile E. dons a Batman costume (wait, hasn't he done that before ???).

I don't know if there's gonna be any new ""Looney Tunes Show"" episodes, but at least there will always be the tried and true classics on DVD and Blu-Ray, and on Cartoon Network.  I'm out !",1346284800,25,2976,4.556390977443609
5100153,4,B007NPME5Y,"It's good to see Bugs Bunny in women's clothes again. I mean it. What's a trickster figure without access to his feminine side? What's the coolest of all animated cartoon characters without his gender bending sangfroid? He's well worth watching in any of his episodic roles here, of course, whether as a would-be restaurateur, a free-spirited office worker, a desperate caffeine junkie, or a frustrated home repair project guy; but without at least the occasional foray into cross-dressing, something's missing.

On the other hand, these discs do emphasize the creepy, sadomasochistic vibe that exists between Daffy (the tormentor) and Porky (his willing victim) which, by the end of the ""Murder"" episode on disc two, has become more twisted and mirthlessly violent than it needs to be. ""Is this funny,"" my partner wondered aloud, ""or just really cruel?""

These fourteen episodes veer off in some mighty interesting directions, though. There's Daffy in an unlikely trial run for single parenthood, Lola moving in with Bugs (temporarily), Porky desperately seeking a date, Sylvester in therapy, Speedy in love, and Pepe shakin' his fine French thing in a music video. The show is still a visual treat for animation fans: you realize how much this generation of animators owes to Kricfalusi, and how much Kricfalusi in turn owes to Clampett and Avery, so the characters have come full circle. (The spatter effect on the background colors may be a little overused here, but it's a very distinctive way of punching up the backgrounds.) In short, it's a pretty good ending to season one of the 21st century's animated, surprisingly hip revival of THE JACK BENNY SHOW.",1344124800,11,1662,5.106617647058823
8519727,5,B007NPME5Y,"My wife and I loved this show.  Its completely hilarious.  Got the 1st part of Season 1 and had to get this one, too.  Really hoping they release the second season.  I don't think anybody really gave it a chance but its great for the adult who grew up with Looney Tunes.",1521676800,,270,4.134615384615385

8519732,5,B007NPME5Y,I'm glad Warner Brothers packaged the last 14 episodes together instead of those volume releases. I also love that it came with digital copies of the episodes. Can't believed this was canceled for that awful Wabbit show. Now just release season 2 on DVD and give us a season 3.,1499040000,4,277,4.56
