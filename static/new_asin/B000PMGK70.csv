8192796,1,B000PMGK70,"Rediculous.  Once again this proves you can get around fact with enough faith.  Show me ancient text anywhere in the world where a dinosaur is descibed in the Flesh.  Nothing.  If you understand that the Bible is a collections of stories passed down through thousands of years, you can stop bending over backwards trying to make humans and dinosaur existing together factual.  Although I did hear that Noah rode a Raptor around looking for wood to build his ark.",1493164800,,462,4.7974683544303796

8192798,5,B000PMGK70,"Ken Ham is very clever, showing how- if you can simply take the Bible at its word- the dinosaurs fit into the text at hand.  While science can fill in the details, to allow it to overwrite the Bible is a tragic mistake.  Assumptions should  never be allowed to override the truth which has stood the test of time for centuries.  It is pleasant to see that science, when used to compliment Biblical truth is a perfect compliment, if we can only remember which takes preeminence.  You will laugh with delight at his  simple presentation of facts which strike one as blatant observations, leaving you wondering how you never noticed it before?",1457827200,,640,4.669642857142857
