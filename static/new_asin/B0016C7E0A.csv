I liked the way it looked in the clip, but I didn't expect it to be so fun. It is fast becoming my favorite workout dvd!

If you like sweating to goth/industrial music GET THIS!

I can't say enough good about this dvd, my only (tiny) gripe is that the second workout doesn't seem as long as the first.",1231718400,3,352,4.223880597014926
3156069,5,B0016C7E0A,"I was thrilled when this DVD came out--I know the ladies from my dancing in the DC area days. In person, it is amazing to hear their booted feet hit the floor in unison, and I was hoping this unity would translate into DVD format.
World Dance and Shakra did not disappoint.  First, the good:  there is definitely a bellydance root in their dance, so many of the moves are familiar in some form.  For those with no bellydance experience, there is a fantastic breakdown of every step.  For those of us with no familiarity with African influenced dance, not to worry--the breakdown helps us, too.  There is a great section on safety and form, and the ladies remind us throughout about posturing, turning, and foot placement.  I found myself being a bit timid with the DVD at first, slowly trying movements outside my comfort zone, but by my third time through it, I felt completely comfortable to step outside the familiar and let my perma-pretty (as my students call it) arms go and flick in the air, circle, and even make fists.
The ladies are easy to hear, their full bodies in frame so that you can see their feet nearly at all times, and each of them have a definite personality when they present, which was captured nicely on DVD.  The lighting is bright (it has been a comment in the past that some World Dance videos are a bit dark), and presentation fantastic.
To say the title of the moves would give no indication of the content, so let me sum it up thusly:  There are variations on marches, grapevines, and twist steps, and variations with arm/shoulder circles in all angles, including pulling the shoulder blades straight in, in a move that made my lats hurt for 2 days.  There are plie-style marches, varations on spine rolls, and a 1950's pony-esque march that I find just incredibly fun...once I got the hang of it.  The strength part of the title comes from, I feel, the increased leg strength, shoulder flexibility, and endurance I got from this.

Now, the bad:  There is no performance.  You can find them on the Gothic BD: Revelations, but on this DVD, there is no performance section.

Great value for the cost.",1230508800,7,2129,4.58311345646438

The Goth/Industrial music is very fun and not overpowering.  These ladies know their stuff and it shows.  I have studied various forms of bellydance for 9 years and would recommend this workout to pros and novices alike, even if you don't dance at all, it's a great workout.  There's a drill for hips, but  not much hips in the combinations, in case that's the workout you're looking for.  But it works everything and you feel great.  I saw Shakra perform at TribalFest before and the moves in this video are true to what they do.  So put your combat boots on and get stomping! =)",1228089600,,876,4.487341772151899

 The long and short of it is, I'd much rather have bought a video of their performances (which are strangely only glimpsed on the DVD) than the workout.

3156073,4,B0016C7E0A,"Different but cool!
 Shakra is three outstanding dancers interpreting their vision of industrial dance, performed beautifully in sync, and with high energy. This is a powerful work out that you will feel especially in the upper torso and arms. These gals don't fool around.
I begin this program with skepticism, but halfway into it, I found an enjoyable,high energy dance that I could easily join into. The dark garb and stomp boots is not typical for me so, I joined in barefoot just to try it out .
Industrial dance by Shakra is the influence of hip hop, bangra, belly dance and African dance, taken into their own interpretation. They are a deviation from the norm and take an eclectic mix of the above dances into their own variation of speed and combinations.
The dance is performed in speeds, called ""gears""with variations from first gear to overdrive
Safety tips necessary to perform the dance safely are included as well.
Dance technique emphasizes posture, while executing  these basic moves: pulsing, flat back, weight transfers, chest and head slides, drop knee, chest lifts, etc..
The  basic moves are executed with power and thrusting behind isolated moves which make them  appear mechanical and robotic. The instruction is clear, and user friendly and one is encouraged to repeat the segments as needed.
The workout is intense and targets hips, oblique, arms, torso, in brief you will feel every body part awaken.
The ""reach"" section is my favorite, intense but increasing strength and flexibility.
The drill section begins with a grapevine and stomp, fling step, twist step, elbow hits,  which are fun and great for coordination. Putting all these basics together to create combinations one and two while using different speeds was challenging but great fun.
 A cool down with yoga follows this lengthy work out which is approximate ninety minutes.
Overall, this was different for me, but aside from the great workout, I
am ready for the techno-industrial dance floor.",1221350400,4,1983,5.067484662576687

3156075,5,B0016C7E0A,"Shakra has effectively combined ancient dances to create a modern workout.  To be honest, I did not think I would like this DVD very much, but I was wrong!  I love it!  It is so much fun!  I loved the music and the moves are really fun to do!  I love that it is in sections, so that when life happens, you at least can get a section or two in before having to go rescue someone or fix the dishwasher that just leaked all over the kitchen floor!  This is fun!  Try it!",1217721600,4,467,3.904255319148936
3156076,5,B0016C7E0A,"Well now, how satisfyingly stompy!

The Shakra girls that make up this tough lookin dancing trio take you through a workout that makes most other exercise programs look \like wet cotton candy. Whew! Where do they get their energy!

But even if this looks like hard work - which it is - it's extremely infectious and empowering. Apart from taking your heart rate up and making you sweat good and proper. Believe me, you're working out.
The Shakra style of dance, ""Transfusion"" is their own experimental blend of African, bhangra, bellydance tribal fusion, and whatever else catches their fancy. You'd think the moves stick out distinctly - but they don't. The whole thing is a smooth blend so that every movement belongs right where it is. I find that remarkable. As they dance, the girls (as I like to think of this powerful looking gang) create an interesting atmosphere. Like many dances, that aura isn't ""look at me"" but more like ""watch out, here I come"". I'd get out of the way if I were me! This is possibly why it feels quite uniquely empowering and very different from doing the usual cardio and aerobics workouts you see around. Yep, the same ones you can't tell one from the other. The ones where a spandex-clad doll goes whee whoo and prances about with impossibly flat abs, leaving you wondering what just happened and why your abs still look the same.

On this video, you learn the moves, along with the necessary safety tips, and do them along right from the start. The pacing is wonderful and natural. The girls then take the move from first gear (on-the-beat tempo) to second gear or double time. They move faster, sometimes going right into ""overdrive"". There are stretches and counter movements in between sets of high-energy steps so that you don't overuse parts of your body or leave them open to injury. This is very expertly done, in my opinion. The moves are also put into combinations that you can learn and then use for little workouts - or do repeatedly for a good solid cardio session. The whole program focuses on strength and flexibility through powerful movements which will get you thoroughly exercised and increase your stamina. You may feel tired a few times but after a bit you'll feel exhilarated and get that well-known exercise-high.
Transfusion would probably not be my choice of dance style because I really do love all the soft, sensual bellydancing I'm learning; but as an exercise form, this workout is most impressive.",1217462400,28,2461,4.772300469483568
3156077,5,B0016C7E0A,"Shakra is 3 women, Bronwen, Na'la and Hilary, who are like 22nd century space Vikings who amaze us with their strength and power, and the incredible speed and precision of their Afro Transfusion dancing. The really good part is that they are excellent teachers, and impart their knowledge so we can do the same (or try to anyway!). You will need to be in heart healthy shape and have lots of agility and athletic ability to do these workouts and dance combinations, and you'll have a lot of fun doing them.

In the 100 minutes of this DVD you'll get: Great safety tips to avoid injury, and some basic technique that helps prepare you for the unique choreography you will be doing in the workouts. There are 2 long workouts, and 2 dance combinations, and a delicious, long ""Cooldown"" to end with, that incorporates many yoga movements, and really stretches you out nicely. This ""Cooldown"" could be used as a lovely workout in itself on your non-Afro Transfusion days.

The music goes well with the dance and though not what I usually listen to I find it interesting and very enjoyable. Featured are :wumpscut:, Decoded Feedback, Terrorfakt, Maduro, The Last Dance, and Collide. This music and choreography is new territory for me, and I thoroughly like the adventure. Shakra, with their big black boots, are treading new ground, and ""by extracting movements from various dance forms"" have created something fresh and exciting. If you want some fast and furious exercise, zoom into the future with Shakra.",1216598400,31,1503,4.8671875
3156078,4,B0016C7E0A,"I love the moves taught on the Shakra Industrial Workout. And the amount of info is great.

However, I expected more cardio and elevated heart rate since ""workout"" is part of this dvd's title. Unfortunately, much of it is instructional, meaning long gaps of slow-paced movements or explanations that allowed my heart rate to fall too much to be a proper cardio workout, even during the workout portions of the dvd.

If you are looking for an instructional dance dvd (of a really neat-looking dance style with thorough explanations and a passionate dance team), this dvd is for you. This dvd is also great for strength training and teaching your muscles to move in ways you probably aren't moving in your average day-to-day.

If you are looking for a good sweat routine, this is probably not for you.

I enjoy the dvd for its own merits, but it wasn't what I was looking for in a workout dvd.",1304899200,,891,4.620253164556962
3156079,3,B0016C7E0A,"This is good for a workout and muscle toning, but there is not very much dance in this DVD. As far as an actual dance routine there is about a three minute routine, and another two minute routine at the end of the DVD. For me that is not enough if you are going to title it a ""dance workout"". It's more muscle toning with a bit of aerobics to simi-creepy music. The moves are fun and I did feel like I had gotten a good workout at the end. The moves are extremely easy. It's a good workout to do when you don't want to have to think too hard. I have only done it twice in the few months that I have owned it. I would not buy it again however since I now own it will occasionally do the workout.",1292544000,3,694,3.86013986013986
3156080,3,B0016C7E0A,"Too much stopping with short dance sequences between.  It would have been great if after the stop-and-go workout and instruction there had been an option to just run through all the high-energy level variations of the combinations demonstrated for an extended, high intensity session.  I loved the industrial music-a nice change form other DVDs-but I honestly got a better workout by turning down the sound on my TV and blasting my own techno-industrial, dancing on my own and picking up the dance combinations whenever the DVD is in ""second gear"".

I love other dance-oriented workouts (Zumba) and think that if you have been doing others for awhile this may not provide the intensity level you are used to.  This is an interesting addition to the genre, but not well executed enough to take me where I need to go. Pity, I was so hopeful...",1289865600,,841,4.819444444444445
3156081,4,B0016C7E0A,"The best thing about this video, is the safety, and warm-up portion of the video. The best of any dance workout video I have yet to come across. The actual workout on the other hand left a lot to be desired. I did not feel like I had worked out at all afterward. If you are beginning in dance workout, get this for the safety and warm-up portions of the video. If you are knowledgeable in these areas, get it for things to add to your routine. But, it should definitely not be the only video you use.",1284768000,,500,4.112244897959184
3156082,4,B0016C7E0A,"I was first drawn to this DVD because of the music it had, which I really really do like.
But the first time I used this, I thought that it was SUCH an easy workout, since I bellydance a lot but have been recently been doing a bollywood workout. So I thought i was ""too fit"" for this workout.
The next day, my upper body was sore and so were my inner thighs.
This workout has helped a lot with my posture. I'm not even really aware that I'm standing and sitting taller, just does wonders for the upper back, especially when you are squatting and are in ""straight back"" position.
The only thing I didn't really like about this video is that, if you haven't had experience in being in an actual dance class and can memorize moves and follow directions flowingly, then you might have a problem keeping up.
But if you're a dancer like I am, then I totally suggest this to you!",1266192000,,872,4.259036144578313
3156083,5,B0016C7E0A,"This DVD is not for everyone.  If you like UnMata and Shakra you will LOVE this DVD.  If you have no idea who UnMata or Shakra are ... watch them on YouTube to see if you like the style.

Shakra ended-up in the ""Modern Fusion Bellydance"" world by default - there is nowhere else to put them.  They have their own ""Industrial"" style which appears to be based on  goth/industrial/club style dancing + a great deal of originality.  This DVD gets 5 stars for FUN factor.  These gals are enthusiastic & encouraging.  The DVD always puts me in a good mood.

If you are expecting a bellydance work-out this is NOT it.  As a bellydancer, I enjoy cross-training with bold, agressive movement which adds contrast to the controlled movement I normally practice.

Some reviews complained about too much talking - but once you grasp Shakra's style you can skip the talky bits and go straight for the drills.  Shakra teaches in ""gears"" starting slowly and speeding-up.  I found their teaching method easy to follow.  Also, once you get into the real workout section ... the talky bits are a chance to catch your breath };>

This DVD is not exactly dance technique and not exactly exercise ... but something in-between.  I am physically-fit and get a good aerobic workout if I finish this DVD.  In fact, I can get a good workout just by finishing 1/2 hour of this DVD - the trick is to skip the intro and go directly to the drills.",1262131200,,1416,4.511811023622047
3156084,4,B0016C7E0A,"***2/3/10 Update  - I always like to update items if I feel I need to rate higher or lower than before. Although the music isn't particularly for me, I do have a volume control and can use this DVD as a way to build strengthing moves for my shoulders & upper back without using weights every day. I'll keep this DVD in my routine for a while then put in on rotation. I'll move my rating from a 'so-so' 3 star to a 'good' tenative 4 star.

I can't believe I had this DVD a year before I was motivated enough to try it. Why did I wait a year? The safety precaution info is great but there are too many interruptions during the workout. Maybe it's meant to be more of a strength DVD than cardio. After 90 minutes I couldn't believe I didn't break a sweat. I did find the arm movements beneficial. I can't say the same about the music - a couple of times during the DVD the word ""Evil"" was belted out in a song. The end of the 2nd workout didn't really 'feel' like an ending - seemed a bit abrupt. The cool down section did provide a full body stretch. Overall I may use this dvd only once a week for a few weeks so that I can get in more cardio time elsewhere.",1258416000,,1157,4.004329004329004
3156085,3,B0016C7E0A,"Previews always make things look so easy and it can be so misleading. I bought this dvd awhile ago excited at the opportunity to learn what looked to me to be really cool dancing (it still is fun). When I saw the preview of it I was so excited and I ordered it almost right away. My gripes with it however have led this dvd to remain on  my shelf for now until I have more dancing experience. They spend very little time on the precautions and foot movements before diving right in with a go go go pace. It seems they should have mentioned at some point in the beginning that this is not a beginner workout dvd. If you want to get a good workout, I would suggest finding something easier before starting on the Shakra Industrial Workout. I couldn't even make it 15 minutes in when I started it. I'm in somewhat better shape now and will eventually try it again but if you are a true beginner like me and have no dancing background, buy this dvd later rather than sooner.",1255996800,9,970,4.243243243243243

If you are not in shape and need to go a slower pace this will be great for you. It was not the work out I was looking for. I thought it was more of a fast paced workout. Too much talking to me.

As they dance, the girls (as I like to think of this powerful looking gang) create an interesting atmosphere. Like many dances, that aura isn't ""look at me"" but more like ""watch out, here I come"". I'd get out of the way if I were me! This is possibly why it feels quite uniquely empowering and very different from doing the usual cardio and aerobics workouts you see around. Yep, the same ones you can't tell one from the other. The ones where a spandex-clad doll goes whee whoo and prances about with impossibly flat abs, leaving you wondering what just happened and why your abs still look the same.

On this video, you learn the moves, along with the necessary safety tips, and do them along right from the start. The pacing is wonderful and natural. The girls then take the move from first gear (on-the-beat tempo) to second gear or double time. They move faster, sometimes going right into ""overdrive"". There are stretches and counter movements in between sets of high-energy steps so that you don't overuse parts of your body or leave them open to injury. This is very expertly done, in my opinion. The moves are also put into combinations that you can learn and then use for little workouts - or do repeatedly for a good solid cardio session. The whole program focuses on strength and flexibility through powerful movements which will get you thoroughly exercised and increase your stamina. You may feel tired a few times but after a bit you'll feel exhilarated and get that well-known exercise-high.
Transfusion would probably not be my choice of dance style because I really do love all the soft, sensual bellydancing I'm learning; but as an exercise form, this workout is most impressive.",1217462400,28,2461,4.772300469483568
3390574,5,B0016C7E0A,"Shakra is 3 women, Bronwen, Na'la and Hilary, who are like 22nd century space Vikings who amaze us with their strength and power, and the incredible speed and precision of their Afro Transfusion dancing. The really good part is that they are excellent teachers, and impart their knowledge so we can do the same (or try to anyway!). You will need to be in heart healthy shape and have lots of agility and athletic ability to do these workouts and dance combinations, and you'll have a lot of fun doing them.

In the 100 minutes of this DVD you'll get: Great safety tips to avoid injury, and some basic technique that helps prepare you for the unique choreography you will be doing in the workouts. There are 2 long workouts, and 2 dance combinations, and a delicious, long ""Cooldown"" to end with, that incorporates many yoga movements, and really stretches you out nicely. This ""Cooldown"" could be used as a lovely workout in itself on your non-Afro Transfusion days.

The music goes well with the dance and though not what I usually listen to I find it interesting and very enjoyable. Featured are :wumpscut:, Decoded Feedback, Terrorfakt, Maduro, The Last Dance, and Collide. This music and choreography is new territory for me, and I thoroughly like the adventure. Shakra, with their big black boots, are treading new ground, and ""by extracting movements from various dance forms"" have created something fresh and exciting. If you want some fast and furious exercise, zoom into the future with Shakra.",1216598400,31,1503,4.8671875
3390575,4,B0016C7E0A,"I love the moves taught on the Shakra Industrial Workout. And the amount of info is great.

However, I expected more cardio and elevated heart rate since ""workout"" is part of this dvd's title. Unfortunately, much of it is instructional, meaning long gaps of slow-paced movements or explanations that allowed my heart rate to fall too much to be a proper cardio workout, even during the workout portions of the dvd.

If you are looking for an instructional dance dvd (of a really neat-looking dance style with thorough explanations and a passionate dance team), this dvd is for you. This dvd is also great for strength training and teaching your muscles to move in ways you probably aren't moving in your average day-to-day.

If you are looking for a good sweat routine, this is probably not for you.

As far as an actual dance routine there is about a three minute routine, and another two minute routine at the end of the DVD. For me that is not enough if you are going to title it a ""dance workout"". It's more muscle toning with a bit of aerobics to simi-creepy music. The moves are fun and I did feel like I had gotten a good workout at the end. The moves are extremely easy. It's a good workout to do when you don't want to have to think too hard. I have only done it twice in the few months that I have owned it. I would not buy it again however since I now own it will occasionally do the workout.",1292544000,3,694,3.86013986013986

It would have been great if after the stop-and-go workout and instruction there had been an option to just run through all the high-energy level variations of the combinations demonstrated for an extended, high intensity session.  I loved the industrial music-a nice change form other DVDs-but I honestly got a better workout by turning down the sound on my TV and blasting my own techno-industrial, dancing on my own and picking up the dance combinations whenever the DVD is in ""second gear"".

I love other dance-oriented workouts (Zumba) and think that if you have been doing others for awhile this may not provide the intensity level you are used to.  This is an interesting addition to the genre, but not well executed enough to take me where I need to go. Pity, I was so hopeful...",1289865600,,841,4.819444444444445

The actual workout on the other hand left a lot to be desired. I did not feel like I had worked out at all afterward. If you are beginning in dance workout, get this for the safety and warm-up portions of the video. If you are knowledgeable in these areas, get it for things to add to your routine. But, it should definitely not be the only video you use.",1284768000,,500,4.112244897959184

But the first time I used this, I thought that it was SUCH an easy workout, since I bellydance a lot but have been recently been doing a bollywood workout. So I thought i was ""too fit"" for this workout.
The next day, my upper body was sore and so were my inner thighs.
This workout has helped a lot with my posture. I'm not even really aware that I'm standing and sitting taller, just does wonders for the upper back, especially when you are squatting and are in ""straight back"" position.
The only thing I didn't really like about this video is that, if you haven't had experience in being in an actual dance class and can memorize moves and follow directions flowingly, then you might have a problem keeping up.
But if you're a dancer like I am, then I totally suggest this to you!",1266192000,,872,4.259036144578313
3390580,5,B0016C7E0A,"This DVD is not for everyone.  If you like UnMata and Shakra you will LOVE this DVD.  If you have no idea who UnMata or Shakra are ... watch them on YouTube to see if you like the style.

Shakra ended-up in the ""Modern Fusion Bellydance"" world by default - there is nowhere else to put them.  They have their own ""Industrial"" style which appears to be based on  goth/industrial/club style dancing + a great deal of originality.  This DVD gets 5 stars for FUN factor.  These gals are enthusiastic & encouraging.  The DVD always puts me in a good mood.

If you are expecting a bellydance work-out this is NOT it.  As a bellydancer, I enjoy cross-training with bold, agressive movement which adds contrast to the controlled movement I normally practice.

Some reviews complained about too much talking - but once you grasp Shakra's style you can skip the talky bits and go straight for the drills.  Shakra teaches in ""gears"" starting slowly and speeding-up.  I found their teaching method easy to follow.  Also, once you get into the real workout section ... the talky bits are a chance to catch your breath };>

This DVD is not exactly dance technique and not exactly exercise ... but something in-between.  I am physically-fit and get a good aerobic workout if I finish this DVD.  In fact, I can get a good workout just by finishing 1/2 hour of this DVD - the trick is to skip the intro and go directly to the drills.",1262131200,,1416,4.511811023622047

Although the music isn't particularly for me, I do have a volume control and can use this DVD as a way to build strengthing moves for my shoulders & upper back without using weights every day. I'll keep this DVD in my routine for a while then put in on rotation. I'll move my rating from a 'so-so' 3 star to a 'good' tenative 4 star.

I can't believe I had this DVD a year before I was motivated enough to try it. Why did I wait a year? The safety precaution info is great but there are too many interruptions during the workout. Maybe it's meant to be more of a strength DVD than cardio. After 90 minutes I couldn't believe I didn't break a sweat. I did find the arm movements beneficial. I can't say the same about the music - a couple of times during the DVD the word ""Evil"" was belted out in a song. The end of the 2nd workout didn't really 'feel' like an ending - seemed a bit abrupt. The cool down section did provide a full body stretch. Overall I may use this dvd only once a week for a few weeks so that I can get in more cardio time elsewhere.",1258416000,,1157,4.004329004329004

I bought this dvd awhile ago excited at the opportunity to learn what looked to me to be really cool dancing (it still is fun). When I saw the preview of it I was so excited and I ordered it almost right away. My gripes with it however have led this dvd to remain on  my shelf for now until I have more dancing experience. They spend very little time on the precautions and foot movements before diving right in with a go go go pace. It seems they should have mentioned at some point in the beginning that this is not a beginner workout dvd. If you want to get a good workout, I would suggest finding something easier before starting on the Shakra Industrial Workout. I couldn't even make it 15 minutes in when I started it. I'm in somewhat better shape now and will eventually try it again but if you are a true beginner like me and have no dancing background, buy this dvd later rather than sooner.",1255996800,9,970,4.243243243243243

I love to dance and love a fun and challenging work out. The first half was ok. I was hoping it got better in the second half. More intensity with more advanced moves. If you are not in shape and need to go a slower pace this will be great for you. It was not the work out I was looking for. I thought it was more of a fast paced workout. Too much talking to me. The music on the second part was just not helping at all. I did not need the briefing on how to do the steps they were very easy to follow it could have been explained briefly right before the exercise.,1233964800,3,734,3.9328859060402683

It is followed up with a dance section and stretch/cooldown. These gals do a great job of explaining their workouts, and it WILL work you out, but they aren't too difficult to keep up with like most other DVDs I have run across. I find I am usually not coordinated enough to manage to do most dance workouts effectively, but Shakra is very good at clearly demonstrating their moves, and they don't move too fast.

This workout also includes a lot of powerful arm and shoulder moves, chest and hip isolations. So it isn't only footwork and cardio. I feel like it gives attention to all of the major muscle groups.

8262153,3,B0016C7E0A,"I'll keep this somewhat short as I tend toward verbosity.

1) If you want an actual Bellydance workout (Tribal Style or otherwise), DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.  There are very few actual Bellydance moves & drills as part of this workout, & none of those are really put in any sort of context.

2) If you are like me & enjoy going to Goth/Industrial clubs & aren't particularly creative with dance moves on your own, you will probably like the moves featured in the workouts on this DVD. Unfortunately, that really wasn't what I was hoping for when I bought this DVD; fortunately, I like stompy/Industrial-style music & dancing & am not a gifted dancer, so I'll be able to utilize moves on this DVD.

Again, THIS IS NOT A BELLYDANCE WORKOUT DVD.  I really wish Amazon.com would reclassify it.  It appears that Shakra does do bellydance as part of their performances & incorporates it into their style, but my opinion is that their style is a lot less bellydance fusion even than Afro-fusion.  I'm no expert, but that's what it seems like to me.  Since I was thinking I was buying a Tribal Fusion Style Bellydance DVD, I am a bit disappointed.  So I hope this review keeps someone from making the same mistake I did.  I did read the other reviews, but I (rather stupidly) ignored the one review that mentions this isn't really a bellydance DVD, thinking instead that the item was correctly categorized here on Amazon.  Good for stompy, not good for belly.",1359331200,5,1446,4.587548638132295

8262155,4,B0016C7E0A,"I LOVE this workout it's fun AND challenging (especially if you're at a beginner/intermediate level), and I love the music. (Then again, I just plain love Industrial music.) This DVD REALLY works out your arms, torso, and thighs, and there's enough cardio in it to really get your heart rate going. (Don't believe me? Try doing a few shoulder pulls...as well as the different styles of squat exercises.)

A lot of people seem to be irritated with the fact that they talk too much when Shakra gives instructions... I am actually very glad that they DO talk a lot. Hearing the counting helps me keep in step, hearing the detailed instructions for certain moves/isolations helps me to make sure I'm doing them right, and the constant reminder to breathe is especially helpful because I have a bad habit of holding my breath when trying to concentrate.

My only criticism is that I feel that Shakra pauses for too long after some sections. I'm sure they do this to give the viewer a chance to break if they need to, but I think it'd be better if they marched in place when taking a break (like Billy Blanks does in his Tae Bo videos), so that those DON'T need a break can keep going. (I took the initiative and march myself during the breaks.)

Also, I think they should mix up which sections of the body they work out a little more. The first part of work-out 1 is mainly arm & upper body, and then the 2nd part of workout 1 is mostly lower body. Though they are great exercises, after doing a bunch of shoulder pulls, I feel inclined to rest my arms, but Shakra keeps going with more arm stuff... It's the same when they are doing squats. I feel like if there was more alternating between the upper & lower body, both areas wouldn't get tired so quick.

Regardless of those [IMO] minor issues, I still greatly enjoy Shakra's workout... I've been alternating between this & Tae Bo for the past 3 weeks & by the time I'm done with Shakra, my muscles ache and I'm uber sweaty, so I know I did good.",1329177600,,1993,4.422343324250681
