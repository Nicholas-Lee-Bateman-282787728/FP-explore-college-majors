7383782,2,B0145UQRB6,This show is way cheesier than I remembered! The lovely Melody Anderson and a misguided childhood nostalgia were the only draws for me. This makes the Incredible Hulk look like Shakespeare.,1448323200,2,189,5.129032258064516
7383783,5,B0145UQRB6,I loved this series.  I watched it when it was on television I even recorded it so I could watch it a lot.  So when I saw it was on dvd I just couldn't wait to buy it.,1448150400,,167,3.3684210526315788
7383784,3,B0145UQRB6,"BUYERS BEWARE!!!
This and ""Automan"" from Shout Factory, is the exact same release as the Region 2 PAL DVD from the U.K.! It even has that constant PAL to NTSC transfer glitch that you get from watching a PAL DVD on an NTSC Television. So if you already have the Region 2 DVDs, don't bother getting this one, i lost a lot of money on it. SHAME ON YOU Shout Factory, SHAME ON YOU!!!",1447977600,8,380,4.148648648648648
7383785,3,B0145UQRB6,"It's great that Shout! Factory has finally released this short-lived 80's cult classic with all 8 episodes as well as an interview with series creator Glen Larson known for his multitude of television hits as Battlestar Galactica and Knight Rider.  Unfortunately, the transfers look like they were taken directly from existing broadcast videotape masters with lots of video lag, judder, moire, and smearing quite noticeable on motion.  In fact, these are exactly the same discs as the U.K. region 2 Fabulous Films DVDs released a few years ago so the lag problems could be from the PAL to NTSC framerate conversion and that Shout! Factory did not want to pay for the expense of doing brand new high-res digital film scan transfers but it's still better than VHS quality by far and it's great these are finally being made available at all.  The packaging is also pretty bad as mine came with the plastic insert disc tray tabs broken and the 3 discs were dislodged and scratched inside and I had to order a replacement from Amazon.  You'd think that Shout! Factory could have come up with better packaging but again, probably going the cheap route for a such an obscure show like this.",1447372800,13,1183,4.784313725490196
7383786,5,B0145UQRB6,"Manimal was a very unique series,perhaps a bit ahead of its time. The story of a professor with the ability to become any animal he chooses,depending upon the situation. His favorites are a black panther and a hawk,although in the course of this series,he has also become a horse,a dolphin and even a snake! The transformation sequences are awesome! I think the series would have succeeded had it not been scheduled against ratings juggernaut Dallas. However,I am thrilled that it is now available on DVD! i was disappointed though that the Nightman episode where Simon Maccorkindale reprised the role of Maminal was not included,but that does not diminish my enjoyment of the original series. If you saw the series and loved it, you'll want this DVD set!",1447372800,7,755,4.952755905511811
7383787,5,B0145UQRB6,"Manimal is a classic 80's show that features a man who can pursue any criminal by his powerful ability to morph into a number of powerfully skilled, or simply powerful animals, including a hawk and a black panther. The show didn't survive past the first season to my disappointment, but it's an entertaining show for those looking for a new take on a super hero crime solver.",1446854400,,375,4.611940298507463
7383788,4,B0145UQRB6,"Awesome, I've been waiting for this forever -- instant pre-order.  However, it's too bad this release won't include the single NightMan episode from 1998 with Simon MacCorkindale reprising the Manimal character.  That being said, Shout! Factory is fantastic for giving us this and Automan.  I hope they release Misfits of Science and Probe someday soon.",1440288000,8,353,5.381818181818182

7383794,5,B0145UQRB6,One of my favorite shows growing up.wwway ahead of it's time! TV was not ready for this! If it came on in the 90s it would have done better.great show great cast. I had fond memories watching the show Growing Up he moved around a lot it was hard to keep up with that because they kept changing the nights on it but he did have a small following. More old 1980s TV show especially the sci-fi shows need to be on DVD I'm glad this one made it. It is a must own.,1505520000,,459,3.893617021276596

7383803,3,B0145UQRB6,"Over the past year I've worked my way through Street Hawk, Airwolf, and Manimal, three 1980s shows from my childhood.  All of these have aged, but I was interested to see how well/badly they had aged.  Of the three I would rate Airwolf the best and Street Hawk a close second.  Both have great music, good characters, exciting action sequences, and interesting story lines.  Manimal wasn't so exciting for me though.  I found the show slow moving with scenes that felt longer than they should have.  Worth a watch for nostalgia reasons but otherwise I would give it a pass.",1480550400,,573,4.68

7383806,5,B0145UQRB6,"Just finished watching ""Manimal - The Complete Series"" released by 20th Century Fox.
""Manimal"" followed the adventures of Professor Jonathan Chase, who, as a young boy, was taught by mystics in Tibet, the ancient art of metamorphosis - shape changing - in order to survive.  While the pilot movie/episode hinted of a darker legacy that burdened Chase, it was never explored in the following episodes of this intriguing short-lived television series from the 1980s.  What is also intriguing about Chase's learned shape-changing ability is that it is a painful one - at least it's implied that it's painful by his raspy breathing and facial expressions as he undergoes each metamorphosis.
Professor Chase, with the help of his friend, Tyrone Earl, combat crime in New York City.  Earl learned of Chase's ""talent"" when the two were intelligence officers in Viet Nam, when the two had been captured and were about to be killed.  NYPD Detective Brooke McKenzie discovers the truth about what Chase can do when she puts the clues together and decides the truth is actually believable.
""Manimal"" wasn't exactly science fiction, and it never really strayed into the fantasy realm - shape-shifting aside.  It was more of a man with a special talent fighting crime show.  What made ""Manimal"" unique was the banter between Chase, Brooke, and Ty.
Sadly ""Manimal"" only lasted for an eight-episode run because it went up against ""Dallas"" during the ""Who Shoot J.R.?"" story arc of the late night soap opera.
""Manimal"" could be rebooted.  It definitely does hint of a broader canvas that could be explored.
A Great Show that was sadly short lived!
Highly Recommended!

7383824,5,B0145UQRB6,"I once watched this TV program while I was attending high school over there.  So, when ""True Blood"" came out, they call people who change into animals ""shape shifters""... I kind of remembered about this one.",1453680000,,207,4.75
7383825,5,B0145UQRB6,"Manimal was a weird show - especial for the '80s. The concept of a man being a shapeshifter was not unknown - witness the many werewolf movies that had been made - but the idea that a shapeshifter could change at will and remain in control, and then use the animal forms he chose to fight crime? That was delightful.

The show, itself, got mixed reviews, but even though only eight episodes were made (counting the feature-length pilot as one ep), the series had an appeal that resulted in a demand for its appearance on home video. As a fan, I was excited to see the show again and I wasn't disappointed. Manimal is still great fun - even the effects hold up better than I expected (I'd love to see the series rebooted with today's effects - and there is allegedly a movie in the works - but for their time, Manimal's effects were cutting edge stuff).

What I wasn't expecting was that there would be bonus features: Man to Animal: An Interview with Glen A. Larson; Concept and Production Notes; Bios; Galleries; Episode Guide Booklet (with full production synopses - ie: spoiler-filled - watch the eps then read the booklet).",1453334400,12,1127,4.574257425742574

8729743,4,B0145UQRB6,"Wow, what a trip back to NBC's 1983 fall season. NBC invited viewers to 'Be There' in the campaign for that fall season, but the reality just didn't measure up to the hype.
This was one of nine new shows debuting that season that would all flop, most not surviving to midseason. David Letterman loved to lampoon this one on The Late Show.
Produced by Glen Larson based on a concept by Donald Boyle.
This DVD set features the original episode teasers and has an interview with Glen Larson. Be sure and catch Manimal's return on Night Man, a late 90s syndicated Larson series you can find here on Amazon.
Excellent liner notes included in a nice little 20 page booklet included. I wish there had been more extras, but for an 8 episode series, the fact that we have it on DVD at all is amazing.
