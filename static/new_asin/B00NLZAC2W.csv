The Team Natalya(Alicia Fox, Emma, Naomi and Natalya) vs. Team Paige(Paige, Cameron, Layla and Summer Rae)-4 on 4 elimination match was a soild,not bad,entertaining bout to say the least. The Bray Wyatt-Dean Ambrose match was pretty well with alot of drama to boot even with the DQ ending. The Adam Rose and The Bunny-Slater Gator(Heath Slater and Titus O'Neil) tag team match was bad but thankfully short. The Nikki Bella-AJ Lee-Divas title match was also bad but thankfully short too. The Team Cena (John Cena, Dolph Ziggler, Big Show, Erick Rowan and Ryback)-Team Authority (Seth Rollins, Kane, Mark Henry, Rusev and Luke Harper)-5 on 5 elimination match was a entertaining,nail-biting,back-and-forth bout with a sursprise ending to boot.

6667172,5,B00NLZAC2W,"Well I must say that this will go down as one of the best (if not the best) Survivor Series ever!  We start off with the tag-team turmoil match for the Tag titles:  This was my first time seeing Damien ""Mizdow"" and out of my 35 years of watching wrestling I think that's the stupidest gimmick I've ever seen a wrestler have!!  Why in the world anybody would want to emulate the Miz and copy his every move is beyond me!!!  If it was Booker T., Hulk Hogan, Triple H. then that would make much more sense!  I think if anything Miz should be copying Sandow!  Anyway this match was better than I expected it to be even though I was cheering for the Rhodes brothers!  Next we get the Divas Survivor Series match which I thought ran wayyyy too long but was still entertaining... I think Naomi and Emma impressed me more than any of the divas in that match!  Wyatt vs. Ambrose was outstanding, Jim Ross would call it a slobber-knocker - those two went back and forth trying to outdo each others craziness!  They did the chair-burying spot with Wyatt at the end but what I couldn't understand was why did Ambrose pull out that great big ladder and climb it if he wasn't going to jump off of it?  He just posed on top of it - he could've done that on the top rope and saved himself some trouble!  Next we get to see The Bunny!!!  I guess Vince put this match in for the children in attendance...but I thought the Bunny was actually pretty entertaining - and he pulled off some great moves!!  Reminded me of Survivor Series of 1990 when the big chicken hatched out of the egg!  LOL!!  Next is the Divas title match which only lasted about 8 seconds - and even though I'm thrilled my favorite Diva Nikki won the title and re-united with her sister Brie, I still would've liked to have seen a better and longer match here.. made me kinda wonder if AJ was injured!
The next match is what makes the whole event!  Authority vs. Team Cena - I must admit I was wrong in thinking Dolph Ziggler was over-rated!!  He made a fan out of me with his performance in this match!!  Shawn Michaels or the Rock couldn't have done any better - he was amazing!!  And what about the acting of Triple H and Stephanie??!!  That was hilarious seeing Stephanie throw her temper tantrum at the end - Stephanie should play in a movie - she's outstanding!  Well Triple H had everything organized for his team to win when ...Here comes STING!!!  I thought the stairdown between Sting and Triple H was the best spot I've seen in a good while - it was obvious they were setting up a rivalry between those two!  The only thing I saw about that was it wouldn't have taken Rollins or Ziggler NEAR that long to recuperate - and they were still out of it when Sting scorpion-dropped Triple H!  Other than that this was a perfect match with lots of great spots (glad to see Cena getting knocked out - I could see that coming a mile away)!!

So all in all this was a great event - and I believe maybe the best Survivor Series so far!  I highly recommend this to any wrestling or general sports fan!",1430784000,,3050,4.279232111692845

SURVVOR SERIES 2014

Spoilers

1.[WWE TAG TITLE FATAL FOUR WAY] GOLDUST & STARDUST  VS THE USOS VS LOS MATADORES VS THE MIZ AND DAMIEN MIZDOW-I am a huge tag team wrestling fan so any time we start out with one of these I am happy. The action is great here with everyone involved looking great. The crowd was really into Mizdow in this one as he reenacted everything Miz did and had happen to him. When he tags himself in and gets the win the fans go crazy showing huge support for him. This was a great opening match full fun moments and good action.

2. ALICIA FOX, NATALYA, EMMA, NAOMI VS PAIGE, CAMERON, SUMMER RAE, LAYLA-this was the first traditional tag match of the night and it was pretty good. There were some good spots during this match but only Natalya and Paige seemed like they belonged the entire time. Still everyone was good despite some missteps. This was a complete domination for Alicias team.

3. DEAN AMBROSE VS BRAY WYATT-one of the matches I was most looking forward to. I am a huge fan of both of these guys, both are future World Champions. This was a great match between these two with both looking great and just battling. This was brawl and fight with a big ending after Bray wins by DQ. Ambrose goes crazy as usual and sends Wyatt through a table and then buries him with tables and chairs. He then sits atop a ladder soaking in the crowd.

4. SLATER GATOR VS ADAM ROSE & THE BUNNY-like others have pointed out this match was really just filler. It was made earlier in the night and was just a match to put the Bunny over as he gets the win in a quick match. Naturally Rose was not happy and this match furthered that.

5.[DIVAS TITLE]NIKKI BELLA VS AJ LEE-this was a very quick match with Brie doing to AJ what AJ had done to her husband at Mania before. She kisses AJ which leads to a very quick win for Nikki.

6. SETH ROLLINS, KANE, MARK HENRY, RUSEV,LUKE HARPER S JOHN CENA, DOLPH ZIGGLER, BIG SHOW, RYBACK, ERIC ROWAN-probably the most important traditional match for the PPV in a very long time, maybe ever. If Cenas team were to lose all of Cenas teammates would be fired. If The Authoritys team lost they would no longer be in power. This match is surprising from the first minute to the last with big moments happening at each. The action here is great with everyone bringing it all which makes the match feel very important. It is a fast paced match with a few surprises including the appearance by the one and only Sting. This was one of the biggest moments in the history of not only the PPV but the company, especially during this digital age. Sting has a stare down with Triple H only to lay him out with the scorpion death drop. From there he helps Dolph Ziggler get the win over Seth Rollins. This match was excellent with big moments, moves, and stipulations. Great match.

BONUS

1. FANDANGO VS JUSTIN GABRIEL-this was a quick opening match from the kick off show. Decent match that would see Fandango pick up the win after a wonderful leg drop from the top rope. Good opening match between these two. I still feel like these two together should be given more time, I think they could give us a good match.

You also get the return of Bad News Barrett in the special features, love him. Also you get interviews with Ambrose and the Bellas. This was a really fun event with some good matches and a few great matches. Add in the historic debut of Sting and you get a five star DVD.",1422403200,2,3433,4.356807511737089

6667190,3,B00NLZAC2W,"It should be noted that the show started out with The Authority (HHH & Stephanie) & John Cena in the ring with Vince McMahon adding the special stipulation that if Team Authority loses then Cena would be the only man capable of reinstating their positions while Roman Reigns gave an interview later in the night updating everyone on his medical condition.

Tag Team Champions Goldust & Stardust vs. The Usos vs. Los Matadores vs. The Miz & Damien Mizdow - Mizdown was completely in ""stunt double"" mode as he continued to simulate every move Miz with some of the opponents were confused at what he was doing with the crowd heavily showing their support for him more than anyone else in the match to the point where Miz & others refused to tag him while others blind tagged him out of the match the moment he got him as all four teams delivered non-stop action at a good pace with great back to back sequences including multiple dives to the outside resulting in a fun opening match.

Elimination Match: Natalya, Emma, Naomi, Alicia Fox vs. Paige, Layla, Summer Rae, Cameron - There isn't much to this match here as some divas having their best showcase I remember seeing since their NXT days as the girls did try to work hard but it was just missing something with the action being very hit & miss while the announce team was more focused on talking about past Survivor Series teams including Lawler's own history at the event while the crowd continued to chant that they wanted someone else from the previous match as the only relevant part of this match was who decided to join in & steal the spotlight during the post-match celebration.

Dean Ambrose vs. Bray Wyatt - Both men started brawling at the bell trading big blows in & outside of the ring including bodies being sent into the outside steps as Bray was able to use his size to his advantage while Dean continued to use his unorthodox offense as both men just continued to be evenly matched either executing the same move at the same time with neither guy countering or blocking the moves & just hitting each other along with playing mind games against the other ending with a wild scene to finish the match as this fun brawl was described perfectly as ""crazy trying to out do crazy!""

Adam Rose & The Bunny vs. Slater Gator - This was pretty short & sweet as was only about continuing the story of The Bunny overshadowing Rose not only in the ring but with his own Exotic Express.

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Nikki Bella - Bree Bella was in her sisters corner for the final 48 hours of being her assistant but completely replicated what happened between A.J. & her husband Daniel Bryan at WrestleMania years earlier helping Nikki win the championship within seconds as this was all about the reunion of the Bellas & screwing A.J.

Elimination Match - Team Cena vs. Team Authority: John Cena, Big Show, Erick Rowan, Ryback, Dolph Ziggler vs. Seth Rollins, Rusev, Mark Henry, Luke Harper, Kane - Either Cena's teammates were going to be fired or The Authority would lose their power in this traditional elimination match that saw various highlights such as the surprising first elimination, who caused multiple eliminations for one team without being the legal man, the Wyatt Family against each other, teamwork from both teams including double & even triple teaming, the impressive power of Rusev, what one man did that shocked both teams when it looked like his back was against the wall, when it got down to the final participants for each team, the aftermath of the match and the two biggest stories coming out of this match being the ""glass shattering"" performance for one man throughout the entire match and what Triple H was doing that caused the appearance of ""The Icon"" who had never been previously seen at ANY WWE live event in the history of the company. This was without a doubt one of the best elimination matches in the history of the event as it was given a heavy amount of time (close to an hour) filled with great wrestling & performances from both teams with some surprising & shocking developments throughout the entire match.

This event was a mixed bag as the main event lived up to the hype & definitely ""broke the internet"" with everything that happened while Ambrose/Wyatt was the other standout match on the card with the opening tag match being very fun however the big issue here was that the other half of this event was pretty much unimportant filler or the same things you see for free on TV for the past few weeks (Divas elimination, Rose & Bunny, Divas Title, Roman Reigns interview) along with starting the show off with a long promo plugging the main event that people had already tuned in to see which more people capable of watching than before due to WWE offering this PPV for free on their network. In the end, this is an event worth watching for what I stated earlier but I would recommend for a rental or stream only because half of the show is worth watching.",1416960000,2,4961,4.605203619909502
6667191,3,B00NLZAC2W,"Survivor Series opens with an in-ring segment featuring Vince McMahon, Triple H, Stephanie McMahon, and John Cena. Nothing major happened in this segment other than hyping the main event. McMahon throws in a few more stipulations for the main event saying that if Team Authority loses, not only will they be out of complete power in WWE, but the only person who would be allowed to bring them back to power would be Cena. More back and forth talk is exchanged between Cena and The Authority with Cena declaring that The Authority has ""no chance in hell"" of winning tonight.

1.) Fatal 4 Way WWE Tag Team Championship Match: The Usos vs Los Matadores vs The Miz and Mizdow vs Gold and Stardust (c)

Survivor Series kicks off with a fairly adequate Tag Team Championship match between the 4 top Tag Teams in WWE right now. We get some decent back and forth action from members of all 4 teams but it's ultimately Mizdow who's the highlight of the match with his antics. Had there been better build-up for this, the match pay-off probably would've been better received. One of the Usos hits a splash on Goldust, and Mizdow ends up stealing a pin from The Miz and pins Goldust and we have new Tag Team Champions. Decent Tag Team with a nicely booked finish to start teasing the split of Miz and Mizdow

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Team Alicia: Alicia Fox, Natalya, Emma, and Naomi vs Team Paige: Paige, Cameron Summer Rae, and Layla

This match was thrown together on the week of the PPV with no build up at all and no reason for it happening. What could've been a decent match ended up being a candidate for worst Divas match ever. The match moved way too slow with a lot of awkward grapples and strikes. The divas finally get a match on a PPV card that's over 5 minutes and it turns out to be an abomination. Team Paige gets completely wiped out by Team Alicia. Cameron goes first, followed by Layla. Summer looks like she could potentially get in an elimination or 2 but she's eliminated by Emma. Then when it seemed like they were going to book Paige as a powerful one woman machine to take out the opposing team by herself; it turned out to be the opposite as she's pinned by Naomi minutes later to bring this dreadful match to an end.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Dean Ambrose vs Bray Wyatt

The build-up to this feud was amazing with Bray Wyatt taking shots at Ambrose's personal life and pulling all of his skeletons out of the closet. The build-up paid off in this stellar match that was a treat to watch as the story unfolded before everyone's eyes with a dash of great in-ring psychology. With Ambrose refusing to stay down, Bray Wyatt being the amazing mic talker that he is, tells Ambrose that they could've ruled the world together. Bray brings in a steel chair but Ambrose uses it against him leading to a DQ. Ambrose lays a post match smackdown on Wyatt with the steel chair before putting him through a table with an elbow off the top turnbuckle. Terrific match with a smart ending to ensure both men still look credible and to continue the feud. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Adam Rose and The Bunny vs Slater-Gator

A filler match that was added to the card earlier in the PPV after a confrontation between the 2 teams. Because when you have 5 matches on a 3 hour card, you have to kill time somehow right? A complete waste of time that failed at being a ""comedy match"". The Bunny pins Slater after dropkick off the turnbuckle. Dissension between Rose and The Bunny continues.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Diva's Championship Match: Nikki Bella w/Brie Bella vs AJ Lee (c)

After a feud that had gotten a decent amount of build-up, it turned out to be an utter disappointment. In what may very well be the shortest divas match in PPV history; the moment the bell ring, Brie Bella distracts AJ with her championship. AJ walks over to Brie only to have Brie plant a big kiss on AJ's lips. The kiss stuns AJ, who gets knocked out by a right hand from Nikki. Nikki follows this up with a Rack Attack to become a 2x Diva's Champion. This match literally lasted under a minute--probably only 45 seconds or less. They could've at least had a few minutes of ring time just to build up to the dramatic ending.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Team Authority (Kane, Mark Henry, Rusev, Luke Harper, and Seth Rollins) vs Team Cena (Big Show, Erick Rowan, Dolph Ziggler, Ryback, and John Cena)

For the first time since the 2001 Survivor Series, a Traditional Survivor Series match main evented the PPV with large stipulations at hand that would decide the future of WWE. If Team Authority lost, Stephanie McMahon and Triple H would no longer have authoritative power in WWE. If Team Cena lost, everyone from Team Cena would be fired....except Cena himself. The stakes were high and the match was fairly unpredictable in terms of what team would come out victorious. The match was really fun and exciting to watch as there was a high fast paced energy throughout this match. Big Show turns on Cena mid-way through and getting Cena eliminated and himself counted out. The final 2 were Ziggler and Rollins. Just as Ziggler had the match won, Triple H assaults the referee and sends in for Scott Armstrong. Just as Team Authority prepare to claim victory; in what may be the greatest Survivor Series moment ever, Sting makes his long awaited WWE debut and has an intense stare down with The Game before laying him out with the Scorpion Death Drop. Ziggler covers Rollins for the win and The Authority is gone from WWE. Amazing match with an amazing ending that'll live within the minds of fans forever.

Overall: Originally, I was excited for this Survivor Series and was expecting it to be decent PPV overall at best. I had high expectations for Survivor Series but was met with low standards. Both diva matches on the card were disappointments, while having a ""comedy"" filler match placed in the middle of the show. The Tag Team match was decent, Ambrose vs Wyatt was physically and psychologically satisfying, and Team Cena vs Team Authority stole the show. Fortunately for WWE, it doesn't really matter how bad this PPV was. Because when fans remember the 2014 Survivor Series, the only thing they'll remember it for is the night that Sting made his chilling debut. Dolph Ziggler should also get some notoriety as well for putting on a heck of a show and being the highlight superstar of that entire match",1416787200,5,6834,4.974583698510079

The opening match was solid, the Champion vs. Champion matches were all good--I thought Brock was going to kill Styles--the traditional team matches worked; Triple H getting power-slammed to Hell by Stroman  was not unusual, but great viewing, nonetheless.
