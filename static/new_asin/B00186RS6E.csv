3411875,5,B00186RS6E,"I also have Steve's 'US Beat' DVD which is similar to this one in that it tries to take a very broad subject and present it without explaining too much or leaving too much out. It must be hard to know how to start on such a broad subject and to know how much to assume the drummer already knows or understands, but Steve manages to do it.
The recommended listening information is great too, because once you get into jazz drumming, you can be spending a lot of money and time to find the recordings! It is a great all round package, but it is not for beginners.

Over time, I realised that although Steve wants to pay tribute to other drummers, he takes the understandable but redundant step of playing their styles (and well known songs) with his band, which is is only going to be partially successful. For me, this is starkly illustrated when he plays the Tony Williams tune. Steve is obviously playing something very close to what Tony plays, but there is no excitement there for me - there is merely technical ability, as if he wanted to compare the sheet music with another player and say 'look how close I got to what Tony did'. The heart, fire and soul of the original players do not seem to be coming through.
Instead, something else is likely to come through - it is like someone doing 'impressions' of someone else. I do not know what that achieves. I think a more successful way of approaching it would be to completely change the arrangement to make it fresh, whic also gives one the challenge of creating same.

He did try to add some extra credibility to this venture by getting John Riley involved (someone who saw many of the original players perform first hand) - this was a shrewd move, however their on camera 'vibe' together is not always positive, perhaps due to the impression (that I have) that John is only there to add comments. John is not permitted to demonstrate things on the drums, which would have added so much more to this.
It is not often that one watches a DVD and feels that the atmosphere could have been cut with a knife.
Steve does a duet with himself on the DVD. It may have been more interesting if he had done one with John.

It is really best to be yourself when it comes to playing, but after watching this I had the the uncomfortable realisation that Steve could have used the great players' achievements to raise his own profile.

There is also the questionable but undoubtedly successful tactic of including Steve's band's CD in the package - this type of music will not sell in large numbers, however including it in the DVD package is a guaranteed way of doing so. I am learning a lot about marketing when I see how Hudson Music present some of their product.",1232841600,10,2709,4.433734939759036

3411878,5,B00186RS6E,"Steve Smith Jazz Legacy DVD Review

Steve Smith has, yet again, given us a wealth of information that will surely send us back to the woodshed for months to come.  This double DVD/CD set is a must have for drummers, regardless of their playing level and style of music they are into.  If you are a jazz drummer or call yourself a drummer who also plays Jazz, then this DVD is for you, as it analyzes the playing styles of several ground breaking Jazz drummers who have laid down the vocabulary of jazz drumming.  If you have analyzed some of these ""Giant"" drummers yourself, this DVD only reinforces those fundamentals and concepts, along with apt demonstration and application of those concepts by Master Drummer Steve Smith himself.  This DVD is also for Jazz musicians, enthusiasts, educators, as well as critics who can get deep insight into the playing styles and analysis of Giant drummers, like Max (Roach), Elvin (Jones), Tony (Williams), Art (Blakey), Philly (Joe Jones) to name a few, all of whom have come up with drumming styles that complement the advancement of the art of Jazz compositions as well as influenced their peer musicians to compose and play differently.  Also sitting on the analyst chair is Jazz Drum Guru John Riley, who has authored the Art of Bop drumming, Beyond Bop drumming, and Jazz Drummer's workshop.  The performances on this double DVD/CD are stunning, executed with the absolute command and mastery of the instrument.  The conversations happening between John and Steve are enlightening in itself.  Also shown are clips of some of the Giants playing their signature licks.  Steve also goes head to head with himself, trading licks, at the end.  You be the Judge!  A  Giant Drumming Legacy is being passed on to us by a Giant Drumming Legend, Steve Smith!",1219104000,8,1794,4.8618421052631575
8268513,5,B00186RS6E,"Great resource for all drummers.  Steve Smith is an amazing player.  Very skilled and technical, BUT, so musical.  This DVD offers a great insight into his approach to Bop drumming.  It shows a concert he did with Jazz Legacy at a Modern Drummer festival.  After each song, he is interviewed by another great drummer, John Riley.  He wrote ""The art of Bop drumming"".  Great book.  Anyway, he asks Steve questions about his approach and Steve demonstrates what and how he played those grooves.  Excellent resource and insight into learning how to play different fills and rhythms.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It also comes with sheet music of grooves and fills he demonstrates.  This is a 3 disc set.  Excellent.  Worth the money",1488672000,,731,4.837398373983739

8268515,5,B00186RS6E,Steve Smith played great on this  I really supported by his own band. Page respect to a number of great dramas that include Philly Joe Jones and Art Blakey along with Max Roach.  He uses new arrangements of standard jazz repertoire. Steve Smith also explains his approach  to these new  arrangements.  Both entertaining and insightful,1485129600,,334,5.0
8268516,5,B00186RS6E,"Up front and in context: the information and demonstrations in this set can be used by drummers playing any genre. However, they are probably going to be more meaningful to jazz drummers. That is only because the styles played and dissected are of influential jazz drummers (although Bonham, Mitch Mitchell and a few other rock drummers are briefly mentioned.)

For me this is like a master class and the demonstrations are mainly from a live performance by Smith and his band at the 2006 Modern Drummer Festival. The performances are inspiring, but it's the between-performance segments with John Riley serving as an interviewer that are the real meat of this set. Riley is excellent in this role and on more than a few occasions asks probing questions that draws out some deep insights from Smith.

If you are already an avid fan of Elvin Jones, Tony Williams, Art Blakey and Philly Joe Jones you will probably immediately connect to the performances and understand the ensuing discussions. If not, you will be introduced to drummers you should be listening to regardless of the genre of music you play. Another giant who gets a lot of mention is Max Roach (and in my opinion, rightly so because the thematic approach he takes to crafting solos is a lesson for any drummer). Plus there are some drummers who are not as famous, such as Joe Dukes who should be studied for his approach to drumming. I liken Dukes' use of space to the way Ahmad Jamal plays piano.

Overall, this is probably not the best DVD for beginning drummers, but will still be inspiring to them. For seasoned drummers, however, this is a gold mine of techniques and advanced topics that are of immediate interest to jazz drummers, but should be more widely disseminated to a wider audience of drummers.",1451001600,,1774,4.771986970684039

8268518,5,B00186RS6E,"Steve Smith's ""Drum Legacy: Standing on the Shoulders of Giants"" is for sure one of the most interesting educational videos concerning the language and the evolution of jazz drumming.
It goes through the styles of different jazz drummers such as Philly Joe Jones, Art Blakey, Tony Williams & Max Roach to name a few, to explore the heritage coming from the history of drumming, a true treasure, for all drummers of all styles.
The heritage, or Legacy, is indeed the amount of musical statements made by these great drummers, some of which are analyzed and examined in this great video.
Inded, a veritable mine of information and useful insights to a musician's musical growth.
A Must Have!
