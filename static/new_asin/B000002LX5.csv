1177439,5,B000002LX5,"This DVD keeps him interested during the entire video. We have several others and he enjoys each one equally as well. His mother had some of these when she was a little girl and she loved them, too. Hers were old VHS tapes and we recorded all of them on one video so she could watch as long as she wanted. They are worth every penny. The secret is to play them a few times so the kids will recognize the tunes!",1174608000,2,410,4.012195121951219

1177442,3,B000002LX5,This dvd is ok.  Certainly not one of our favorites.  My 12-month old son is crazy about all The Babysong dvd's by Hap Palmer.  This one does not seem to engage him as much.  Too many advertisements at the beginning which requires constant FF.,1128297600,5,243,4.454545454545454

1177445,5,B000002LX5,"This video is lively totally & entertaining!  My son at age 18 months could easily sit through the entire  30 min video.  Songs include ones like ""Down by the Bay"" & ""Mail myself to you.""
My husband & I end up watching at least 1/3 - 1/2 of tape with our son because the songs are sung by children but redubbed later for better quality singers & acoustics.
I would by more Tyco Kid Songs such as ""Ride the Roller Coaster"" or ""Trains, Bus' & Airplanes""",991008000,8,451,4.22093023255814

Maybe the age of it has something to do with it, but he's only 18 months so I don't think he would pick up on that yet. I'll just keep trying as he gets older.",1444608000,,295,3.6984126984126986

1177467,5,B000002LX5,I used to watch these videos as a child and I was very excited to find them on DVD for my own son. He was about one when I ordered the movie and he loved it and still watches the Kidsongs DVDs (he's 2 and 1/2 now). He likes to sing along.
