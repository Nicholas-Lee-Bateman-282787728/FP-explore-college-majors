This product has four Sherlock Holmes movies from the 1930s about the most famous fictional detective in literature. Here is a brief description. Read the reviews for each movie. That Maine Hunting Cap on Sherlock came from a Broadway show, not Doyles stories.

Sherlock Holmes: Murder at the Baskervilles, 1937 film
Holmes and Dr. Watson take a vacation at the Baskerville estate. Inspector Lestrade says Silver Blaze will win the race. Silver Blaze is carefully guarded. The next morning Silver Blaze is missing! Colonel Ross asks Holmes for help. A dog barks as they approach. Holmes asks for an old horseshoe. The body of Straker is found out on the moor. Where is the horse? Holmes follows the tracks. He talks to Silas Brown, the owner of a competitive horse, who will do as Holmes says. Holmes has his plans. Who bought Strakers promissory notes? The dog always sleeps outside at night. Holmes questions Mrs. Straker. Some of the sheep have gone lame. What was that curious incident of the dog in the night? Curry disguises the taste of opium. Holmes explains the facts to Colonel Ross. The chief clue was the surgeons scalpel. [The story Silver Blaze was used for this movie. Note how minor details can add up to solve a mystery.]

Sherlock Holmes: The Sign of Four, 1932 film
Jonathan Small tells of a treasure buried in a fort in Agra. Major Sholto and Captain Morstan search for the jewels. Will there be a conflict? Retired Major Sholto reads about the escape of Jonathan Small. He tells his two sons his secret then collapses. Mary Morstan owns a florist shop and gets a strand of pearls! Two men invade the Sholto home to search for the treasure. Mary Morstans safe is cracked. A letter calls her to a meeting, she is warned against going to the police. The ending was changed from the original novel, which had a more ironic ending. It is one of the best of the Holmes films. Ian Hunter is the best Doctor Watson, a young man around thirty. There is subtle criticism of British Imperialism in its looting of the treasures of India.

Sherlock Holmes: A Study in Scarlet, 1933 film
A train arrives in Victoria Station, one compartment has a dead man inside! A newspaper column has a coded message. A man and a woman visit a house. This group tells about another death. Miss Forester is a visitor. A woman visits Baker Street, she is Murphys widow, and wants what is rightfully hers. Merrydew the lawyer ends the meeting. He advises a woman not to marry for now. A man is shot dead! Merrydew steps outside, that young woman screams and faints when she sees a man. That body has disappeared. Later the police find a floater. The face was battered, Capt. Pike was identified by a ring. Sherlock Holmes inspects the letters found on the body, then talks to the widow. She has a lawyer. A man receives a coded message. There is a shot. A ring on a finger for years would leave a mark. The plot was based on a theft of jewelry from the Chines Emperor. This story is a mixture of original Sherlock Holmes stories. The thieves recall The Sign of Four. The battered face recalls The Valley of Fear. The coded message recalls The Dancing Men. Note the availability of pistols then.

The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes, 1935 film
Sherlock Holmes plans a retirement. Inspector Lestrade visits with news of a murder at Birlstone Castle. Holmes and Watson go there to investigate. The body of Mr. Douglas has a brand on the arm. The murderer took the wedding ring from Mr. Douglas finger. Lestrade questions the people there. [Does the wife seem sad?] That brand is the mark of a secret society. Widow Douglas tells of their history in America. She met Jack Murdock in America. What about the missing dumbbell? Barker and Mrs. Douglas laugh over their behavior. At night Holmes solves the crime by finding a missing person. This story shows how easy it is to jump to a wrong conclusion when you depend on circumstantial evidence alone. Holmes does not make this mistake. [How could a private detective amass a great fortune to buy a castle in England? The story Valley of Fear was used for this movie. Note how minor details can add up to solve a  mystery.]",1461024000,,4178,4.631578947368421
8036785,1,B000622H94,"I was really looking forward to watching these Sherlock Holmes movies as I had not seen or heard of them before. The leathercase package was the only good thing about this product. Video and audio on the DVDs were so terrible I couldn't even watch them. This is the first DVD product I ever purchased that I had to return because I couldn't watch it. Video was extremely grainy and all over the place, there was a hissing on the audio track which made it almost impossible for me to listen to it. And there were no subtitles. If they expect to continue to sell this product they better remaster it, restore it, blu-ray it, or something otherwise, it is unwatchable.",1430697600,,665,4.5041322314049586
8036786,1,B000622H94,"I bought this because I love old Sherlock Holmes movies and I had just recently watched A STUDY IN SCARLET on cable.  My husband and I watched that same movie from this Special Edition boxed set.  Having just watched this movie recently, I was familiar with it.  The sound on this DVD is absolutely TERRIBLE!!!!  Halfway through this movie it sounds like a train is clunking past (for several minutes) and it's NOT part of the movie.  Were these things recorded in someone's basement?  For the price I paid--it should be a decent copy of the movie.  So I recommend you not waste your money on this crap--go find a different copy!",1403481600,,629,4.5625
