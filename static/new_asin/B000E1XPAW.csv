8104434,5,B000E1XPAW,"One great resource we used for the savanna:  Wildebeest: The Great African Migration  or, as we like to call it in our house, 48 Ways to Kill a Wildebeest.  This was a GREAT movie, if your kids don't mind death and destruction.  My girls actually watched it at BEDTIME and loved it!  It told the story of the wildebeest of Africa and their great migration (in case you didn't get the gist of it from the title!).  Unfortunately for the wildebeest, they have a tough life.

We saw baby wildebeest get separated from their mothers and die of dehydration, baby wildebeest (hereafter known as WB) get eaten by hyenas, baby WB cross a muddy river and bake to a hard muddy crust in the sun, baby WB born deformed and doomed.  We enjoyed watching adult WB trample each other, get eaten by lions, hyenas, giant crocodiles, vultures and wild dogs, break a leg and drown, fall and drown, get dragged under by crocodiles and drown.  The only thing we never saw was a WB get hit by lightning.  I think one even died of a heart attack over stress from the failing economy.

In any case, it was a well-done video (although I think all the WB were eaten raw) and if you don't have squeamish kids, it's worth a watch if you can find it.",1223596800,7,1220,4.353982300884955
8104435,5,B000E1XPAW,"Incredible filming!

This documentary takes you through most of a year in the life of a herd of wildebeest.  The filming is done very well, giving the viewer an excellent view of the plains of Africa.

I use this as a science video.

It completely illustrates the Savannah biome.

It shows all types of ""relationships"" among organisms (predation, parasitism, and mutualism).

It allows great discussions on food webs and food chains.

But most of all it is riveting.  It holds the attention of EVERYONE, kids and adults alike.

It can be a bit gruesome and even sad - but these are needed in the illustration of the life (and death) of the wildebeest.  Everything loves the wildebeest, they must taste like honey.",1179446400,10,713,4.770491803278689
8104436,5,B000E1XPAW,Very impressed with the production especially since it left out any reference to the evolution illusion - refreshing - a must see!,1175731200,6,130,4.954545454545454
