This is a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1441,4.255474452554744

This is the second time I've bought this particular DVD(factory sealed, mind you), and both have the same problem of not playing passed a certain point. I own the entire series of Yu Yu Hakusho, and this is the only DVD in which I've encountered this problem.

If you're planning on buying this DVD, take it from the guy who now has two spiffy Yu Yu Hakusho drink coasters: don't buy it new. Find a seller who knows his copy works and/or is not just trying to dump off a devective disc.",1225065600,,548,4.372549019607843

Definately a must to any fan of the series. If you can buy it you should.",1109116800,,216,4.2682926829268295
