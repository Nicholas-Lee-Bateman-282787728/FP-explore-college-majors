8356361,3,B0028LW7UU,"This DVD is good primer for a person who has no background or experience in wrestling, especially in Catch Wrestling.  With that said I thought it would be a bit more inclusive as far as demonstrating more than just stances and postures and for that, I can only give it 3 stars.  The quality and material is 5-star no doubt!  I was hoping that within the first DVD of the series they would have show more techniques that one could incorporate into your own 'toolbox' of counter-offensive or street self-defense tactics.  I may get the 2nd volume and hopefully it will go a little bit beyond just basics stances and such.",1456790400,,620,4.558558558558558
8356362,4,B0028LW7UU,"Snap no Tap Vol. #1 sets the foundation in catch wrestling's fundamentals as taught in Cecchine's system. His is one of a few different systems dedicated to catch wrestling that are out there. Cecchine has a different style of teaching that may or may not appeal to some people. I personally like his instructional method. Regardless of this, I found the material on the DVD to be very sound. I use his DVD's as a supplement to my other martial arts training. Highly recommended.",1308441600,,479,4.714285714285714
