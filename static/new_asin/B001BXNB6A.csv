8305043,5,B001BXNB6A,The last protector and pride of the working class. Reminds  me of Comrade Lenin's passion to change the system. Makes me want to read more books about this man!,1461974400,,160,4.517241379310345
8305044,3,B001BXNB6A,"If the filmmaker had bothered to subtitle the Russian and German speakers and French subtitles into English, this would have been an amazing documentary. The film's current format (which according to Amazon doesn't support subtitles) is frustrating because I wanted to know what the various speakers were saying and I don't speak Russian or German.  I suspect this was a patchwork put together from previously worked films with patches of English narration added. I don't know why the filmmaker didn't take the trouble to format it properly before he put it out for sale and I don't know why Amazon is running it in its current format and charging for it.  Because of these factors I can't give this film a good rating in its current format.  If the filmmaker had done a proper job of it, I would have given it 5 stars because the subject is intriguing and I would watch it again in a minute if I could read or understand all that was said.",1424649600,3,940,4.583333333333333
8305045,5,B001BXNB6A,Awesome films.  Awesome filmmakers.  A great combination set.  Would get for others who I think might be interested in these films as well.,1359331200,2,139,4.956521739130435
8305046,2,B001BXNB6A,"Shame. Seems like a great film but can't seem to find the English subtitles.
If indeed they are not provided in this copy that might be a good thing to mention.",1334016000,9,160,4.193548387096774
8305047,3,B001BXNB6A,"The Last Bolshevik is a documentary about the Soviet filmmaker Alexander Medvedkin. French Director (and fellow traveler) Chris Marker obviously admires his subject, and he means this to be a sympathetic film. Yet, I find it difficult to share his admiration. On an artistic level, even though I have never seen a Medvedkin film, and it is impossible to judge a director's craft by the segments shown here (lasting a few minutes), I can say there is nothing in the movie that makes me suspect we are in front of a major artist. More complicated is the political aspect of his life. He was a life long unrepentant communist. The film makes much of the fact that his movies represented the soviet artistic vanguard that Stalin ended dramatically in the early 1930s. Yet, during the Stalin era, not only he was not repressed, but he was able to make Stalinist movies (Marker show some segments of these movies, too). On the whole, this is a fine movie about a man whose life I consider to have been less than exemplary.",1172880000,6,1016,4.65
