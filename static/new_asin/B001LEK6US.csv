8317883,1,B001LEK6US,"I ordered this product and it took 2-3 weeks to get to me and I found out why when I got it, it came from Portugal. I was very disappointed with the sound quality. It was like Aerosmith was preforming in a local club with cheap sound system. I wanted to return it but it seems it will be more of a hassle that it is worth.",1308960000,6,322,3.8208955223880596

8317885,5,B001LEK6US,Aerosmith is a hard band to find any live concert video. The only ones I have are Texas Jam on VHS tape and the you gotta move DVD that the band talks between almost every song. This being an import from some benefit concert I was not expecting much. This DVD rocks thru 14 straight songs from a 2007 concert in New York. Only 1 time does Tyler start talking about the benefit toward the end of the show. Video and sound are good . If you like Aerosmith buy this DVD.,1296432000,18,467,4.086956521739131
8317886,3,B001LEK6US,"This video has it's good and bad points:

Good - good variety of old/new Aerosmith songs, overall good energy and performance (I give it a ""B""), fun to watch the band in a smaller venue and their interaction with the audience members and each other. No distracting interviews or narration - just straight performances.

Bad - the video portion of this show is better than the audio. Mixing and editing is less than profesional. This is a benefit concert and someone decided to record it and then release it. It's an Import dvd - I can't tell if the sale of this dvd further benefits the charity or not.

Aside from the technical issues, I overall liked this video. I only paid $10 for it though!",1250380800,18,695,4.5
