It has no redeeming features, but lots of innaccuracies and mispronunciations. They call Bowie's son Duncan Zowie Howard Jones, and suggest Bowie was obsessed by Charlie Chaplin (actually he had an interest in Buster Keaton). These, and others, are elementary errors that show a complete lack of knowledge or research.

I particulary ""enjoyed"" the repeated views of Alders department store in Bromley, and what looks like a supermarket on the site of the register office where David and Angela got married. These add greatly to the viewers knowledge of Bowie - NOT!

I should also single out for attention the background music which is designed to sound like various Bowie songs (Changes, The Jean Genie and Let's Dance, for example) without  actually being anything to do with Bowie at all.

Really, this is laughable, and anyone who thinks there are learning anything about Bowie from this DVD is sadly mistaken.",1228867200,,1050,5.0520231213872835
8116490,1,B000F2CA8S,"If you think the most fascinating period of David Bowie's career was before he actually started making music, than this is for you.

This incredibly cheap DVD not only has not a scratch of Bowie music, there isn't even footage, anytime Bowie is shown it is through amateurish photos.

This DVD is more suited for The Travel Channel than VH-1, as it is composed almost entirely of a puffed-up documentary-type fellow driving through England's greenland or showing the exteriors of different buildings Bowie inhabited in his youth, giving a very generic Bowie bio along the way, getting some of the info wrong of course.

Forgive me if I'm not real helpful as I did fall asleep about 30 minutes into this less-than-an-hour documentary, but when I woke up a few minutes later, I watched a random guy playing a random song on a guitar for about 5-10 minutes.

Take that for what it's worth.",1182556800,3,886,4.733766233766234
8116491,5,B000F2CA8S,"Just like the other On The Rock Trail series DVDs, this one is a great documentary on how and where David Bowie got started in the music business. There is no David Bowie music on the DVD, which it clearly states in the description, which is fine with me, I think this documentary is very informative, and I don't miss the music.",1149552000,,329,4.32258064516129
