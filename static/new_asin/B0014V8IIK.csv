3134938,5,B0014V8IIK,"Andrzej Wajda's masterpiece, KATYN, was recently nominated for the Oscar. It is a very moving, educational, and thought-provoking film.

The movie begins with the German-Soviet conquest of Poland in 1939. The viewer senses the actions of the aggressors through the eyes of the civilians.

But this is only the beginning of Poland's sufferings. Both enemies of Poland begin their genocide of Poles with the cream of Polish society. The Germans invite some professors to the university, only to promptly arrest them (for shooting, or slow deaths in concentration camps). The Soviets hold the captured officers and intellectuals at places such as Kozielsk, where the prisoners sing Christmas carols in December 1939. It will be their last Christmas. By spring 1940, the Soviets decide to shoot nearly all of the captive Polish officers.

The movie also shows the life of relatives of the Soviet-held men. First there are the letters, and hope for a speedy reunion. Then...silence. Finally, the Germans break the news of their discovery of the Katyn mass graves, and exploit it for propaganda purposes--hoping to divide the Allies. The relatives face the fact that their men will never return.

After the war, the suffering of the Katyn relatives continues. Information about the exact fate of the missing men is skimpy. The Soviet puppet state, using the Communist terror police (the UB), tries to force the grieving relatives to sign a statement blaming the Germans for the crime. The relatives also face pressure from others to ""accept reality"" that Poland will never again be free, and must align itself with Soviet dictates. They refuse. Then they have problems sending their son to the university because they won't bow to the Soviet lie about Katyn.

Polish movies tell it like it was, and often don't have a happy ending. WARNING: This movie has graphic scenes of the Polish officers being shot and blood being spilled. This may upset sensitive viewers. These scenes come near the end of the movie, as the victims are trucked to the sites of death, and, one-by-one, shot point-blank in the back of the head. The beginnings of the ""Our Father"" are the last words on their lips.

A superb movie! I only wish that it was translated into English, and widely used in history classes throughout the English-speaking world.",1210550400,29,2320,5.028645833333333
3134939,3,B0014V8IIK,"I bought the region 2 version in Poland, which is Polish with English subtitles, since I could not wait any longer for the US version to go on sale here.

The Polish people deserve a better movie, and certainly a better musical score, to tell this important story. What a shame!

First, this seemed more like a TV movie or mini-series, in terms of video and sound quality, than a film.

Secondly, I and several others viewing this together for the first time, were first struck by the way in which the ""suffering"" was displayed in the film. The wives and children left behind by the Polish officers were supposed to be going thru extreme deprivation, mental torture, angst and fear, while waiting so many years to hear the fate of their loved ones. But that is poorly shown here. The children have good clothes, food, and get to go to school. The families have nice homes and in some cases live with relatives who look after the kids. People have jobs, public transport is still operating regularly, shops are open. People still get to go to the parks and public squares. This is war, against an oppressed people, whose country is occupied by a hated enemy? I was truly confused.

Third, the god-awful score--intrusive and distracting, cartoonish and over-the-top--takes so much away from the film. I wish I could have viewed it without music at all.

There are some excellent actors in this film, and except for a few notable scenes, their talents are wasted.

The finest among them do their best with the poor dialogue and seeming lack of direction. Especially the very fine actors playing the Red Army captain harboring Anna and her daughter, the actress playing Anna--truly wonderful--and the male actors playing three of the four featured Polish soldiers: Andrzej, Jerzy and the general. Everyone else seems to be overacting, or acting for the first time.

Though the director is a lion of Polish cinema, his roar is muffled here.",1209427200,2,1935,4.775449101796407

To do so, he purposely had killed all the educated/elite/military echelons people of these nations he could get his hands on. His secret police did his dirty work. The west came to know about these events but little could be done about them, especially while the war itself was going on. Poland's history is one of tragedy visited upon their people all too often.

3134955,5,B0014V8IIK,"An incredible, heart-rendering human interest story of the tragedy of the Katyn Forest Massacre.  This event followed the invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II in which the Soviets attempted to forever obliterate Polish ethnicity by rounding up Polish military leaders, intelligentsia, politicians, and others of influence, transporting them to the USSR, then brutally murdering them and dumping their bodies into mass graves.  This wonderfully crafted account of an actual historical event underscores the pain and suffering of both the victims and their families, both during the war and in the aftermath when relatives struggled to find the fate of their lost loved ones.  This movie is exclusively a Polish production, and this adds so much to its authenticity because the director, actors, and production staff were well-acquainted with this tragedy and poured their hearts into its making to tell this story.  Be sure to view the ""extras"" for a deeper appreciation of the massacre and the production.

3134965,5,B0014V8IIK,"I saw Katyn when it was commercially released in the U.S.  It made a strong impression on me at the time, but what's interesting is that since then, it's never really left the very back of my mind.  I would never pretend that I've seen the majority of Wajda's movies or even a minority of them (I recall three), but this is truly a great film.  But I also believe that the film's actual agenda has not been discussed in any reviews or comments about the movie I've seen.

I believe that the actual story of the Katyn Forest Massacre is the backdrop to what the film is really about.  Don't get me wrong, it's certainly front and center in the story, and thankfully Wajda does not concoct some silly improbable romance as a way of telling a difficult story.  But what I saw in the movie seemed less to me about Katyn pure and simple, than a discussion of the nature of the impossible choices Poland was facing post-war when the Soviets were completely in control.

What the film does masterfully is successfully convey the impossibilities of living with either the Nazis or the Soviets, and the actual brutalities experienced.  Once World War 2 was over and the Soviets were in control, citizens in Poland has two choices:  cooperate with the Soviet regime and survive, or oppose it (however hopelessly and ineffectively) and get crushed.  What the film shows over and over again in the post-WW2 scenes is that those that tried to resist, however futilely, were destroyed.  The only path forward, the film argues, was cooperation and collaboration.

My best guess is that in post-Soviet Poland, a line of argument has emerged in popular discussion that many in the society were guilty of working against Poland's self-interests in the manner that they co-existed or even collabored with the Soviet regime.  I suspect that Wajda's agenda in this movie is to answer that charge, coming from someone who chose the cooperation pathway.  Certainly anyone who's seen ""Man of Marble"" is not going to argue that Wajda was a true-believer in the system, while certainly being integrated in some manner into the power structures of Poland at the time.  But the point that Katyn makes so strongly is, there was no other path forward other than to cooperate with the regime, or to be crushed.

This is an intelligent, provocative, and extremely powerful movie.  I was cognizant of the fact while seeing the film that I was watching a master at work.  This is a movie that shows a life's worth of experience, and a lesser or younger filmmaker could not have made it.

In difference to Hotel Rwanda which shows similar institutionalized gross genocide to gain financial resources, Katyn is the movie about gross scale extermination with goal to subjugate through deception larger population.

It took over 50 years to finally talk about events depicted in the movie, yet deception is still ongoing.

You should note that any movie that is blocked as much as this movie deserves time of the individual not easily deceived. Over the years I have observed the reaction to this movie and financial censorship used to enforce it.

Finally when I was able to watch this movie I understood why.

Even though the movie is fiction, it is best seen as a dramatised documentary about one incident in the second world war. So unless you are Polish or a history buff you will not like this film.

That is not to say that you should not see the movie. In some way it is good that we are getting movies showing the suffering of other people than the Jews. I am not belittling the killing of millions of Jews, but in my opinion we need more stories highlighting the suffering of Poles, Russians, Germans, homosexuals, Singaporeans, Chinese, etc. The Poles never had a rich diaspora so this movie had to wait a long time to be produced.

3134984,5,B0014V8IIK,"In 1940 Stalin had the NKVD murder some 15,000 Polish officers who fell into Soviet hands when the USSR belatedly joined in the German invasion of Poland. This is not just the story of the crime itself, which is brutally portrayed on the screen, but of the lies told to cover it up, necessary lies if Poland was to exist as a Soviet satellite.

In the movie four officers and their families are portayed. At first the officers are treated as POWs and many cannot believe that the Russians will harm them, believing as they do that their skills will be needed by the Communist occupiers or that they will be given a chance to continue the fight against the Nazis. They do not reckon with Stalin's paranoia or Beria's (his secret police chief) rather simple solution to those who oppose the regime.

Aside from the murders of the Poles, many of whom had their hands tied with barbed wire and were shot in the back of the head, the director shows the lies which began immediately after the war. The Nazis murdered the officers in 1941 they claimed, following their invasion of the USSR. Anyone who contradicted this idea in the new puppet state, whether student or soldier, would pay a price. The Soviets were liberators. To say otherwise was politically incorrect.

Great direction in this and the acting was superb. Well worth watching.",1326067200,5,1335,4.672340425531915
3134985,4,B0014V8IIK,"You have to feel for the Poles. The Russians have repeatedly raped Poland over the centuries.

The Katyn massacre is one of those items that make up That Which Must Not Be Mentioned about WWII. Another one is that the Soviet Union and the Third Reich were Allies during the first few years of the war as they had agreed to partition Europe between them, starting with Poland. Later, when one of the allies attacked the other one, the original pact of alliance was never mentioned, as being in bad taste if you did.

The Katyn massacre, in particular, made a deep scar in the Polish psyche, more so than the Nazi occupation. Perhaps it was due because Russia invaded the country when it was trying to fight off the German invasion, perhaps because the subsequent occupation by the Communists tried to convince the Poles that the Russians were their friends, perhaps because the Russians refused to acknowledge what everyone knew. Who knows.

The ending of the film is brutal to watch, but it needs to be watched.

Another thing that makes one sick is that the Poles behaved with honor towards the conquerors, not realizing at the time what vicious monsters they were dealing with. Example: (a) the professors naively show up at the university, summoned by the SS officer, only to be brutally rounded up and sent to Sachsenhausen (b) the Polish officers are initially loosely guarded, which means that many could have easily escaped, but did not do so and therefore were subsequently butchered by the Communists.

I did not give it five stars because of one fault that the movie has: to people who are unacquainted with the history, as was the case with my wife, events seem to jump.

Its the story of a little known genocide (22,000 slaughtered) that took place during WWII in Katyn Forest. Its the story of how war tears apart families and compromises allegiances.  Its the story of a country's occupation by foreign invaders and its national resistance toward that oppressor.  Finally, its the story of crimes against humanity and the lingering effects on those left behind to mourn their loss.

Pajda was so adept at weaving together the warring threads of three countries (Poland, Germany and Russia) that viewers might find themselves peeking between the soldier's seams to determine who's wearing the uniform. The Politics and Propoganda become apparently real as the movie comes to an unforgettably emotional climax.  I was also impressed by the subtle linkage of one family's story with that of another family. I didn't expect to make sense of some things I saw early in the movie, only to have their meanings illuminated later. The power of an Excellent film!

The DVD Extra which shows an interview with Director Andrzej Wajda is priceless. Here's what he had to say on the importance of education and developing one's self:

""Developing one's self through one's interests or work, making movies, creating an identity, the fact that one searches for people who think alike, is dangerous to any authority because authority always wants subjugation; to agree to everything. It wants an easy society.""

On Patriotism: ""Those who preach it the most, are the least suitable for it.  They have the least, so to say, heart, courage, and judgment to take advantage when the time is ripe.""",1315094400,7,1856,5.0359477124183005
3134987,4,B0014V8IIK,"Katyn, is the revealing prelude of Soviet Russia's plans for Poland, ironically, similar to thos of Nazi Germany. Namely, to eliminate those people in Poland who could possibly be a threat to Soviet takeover of part of that country, after Germany & USSR both invade Poland in 1939, as allies. Germany from the West, Soviets from the East. As a rssult of Poland's defeat at that time, more than 10,000 Polish Army officers fell into Sovit hands. It was a decion of Josef Stalin, Russia's bloodthirsty tyrant to ""liquidate"" (exterminate) these men.

The action takes place in prison camps, and in several Polish cities, as the relatives of the officers were frantic to find out what had happened to their loved ones. Although absorbing, again I felt the editing could have been smoother, as the film seemed to jump around too much.

However, except for the Polish people, few in the world knew or care about the  massacre of Polish Army officers, in the Forest of Katyn, Poland, part of  the horrendous legacy of WWII. Again, except for Poland the same feeling pervades.

It was, both a massacre designed to destroy Poland and a cover up. This film deals with both parts with reference to the murder of the Polish officers which is actually only about a third of the killings.

One point that I did find distasteful in the movie is that Poland before WW2 was a much more diverse society than now. Many that died in Katyn were not Polish Catholics. Large numbers of Orthodox, Jews and some Muslims were among those executed. These people have been written out of the movie.

The acting was not particularly good. Many of the characters development, I thought was weak. The filming was good.

I think it was the strong story line and good directing that made it for me such a good movie.

I particularly liked the killing scenes at the end. It looked very accurate. The officers names checked off, he being taken to the cell, shot in the back of the head  and then being dumped on the trucks.

By the way, Vasili Blokhin the man that did the actual killing holds earned the Guinness World Record for 'Most Prolific Executioner'. Much of it was in Katyn where he and his team killed one person every three minutes.",1305676800,5,1412,4.470817120622568

3134991,5,B0014V8IIK,"I ordered this movie based off the reviews I had read and just finished the movie ten minutes ago. Well, for a while, the movie shows the Polish officers languishing in captivity right up to April, 1940, but their fate remains a mystery for most of the rest of the movie, when the next scenes take place right after the discovery of the mass graves in 1943, and then right after the Russian armies occupied Poland in 1945. You see a lot of the relatives of the missing men as they mourn their loved ones, and some get bitter when the Soviet propaganda films announce about the Germans committing this massacre of 20,000 Polish officers in the summer of 1941, as opposed to the truth about the massacre in April, 1940. For a while, I thought, ""What the hell? Everyone in this movie are all talking about Katyn, but you don't show us exactly WHAT happened to those Polish officers!""

Then right after you see a girl arrested by the secret police in Communist Poland after daring to make a tombstone for her missing brother announcing his death at Katyn on April 10, 1940, the truth is revealed by the recovered entries of her brother's diary, and the last scenes of the movie show the Polish officers then being herded off the train and into buses with blacked-out windows as they're driven deep into a forest about 10 kilometers from Smolensk in western Russia. Then the scenes show the execution of a high-ranking Polish general and other prominent officers deep in some kind of building, where the Soviets throw a fresh bucket of water on the floor to wash away the blood of the murdered men, and the bodies are dumped onto trucks. The rest are herded off the vehicles right up to the burial pits and are murdered with a single bullet through the head, some of them saying their last prayers and holding rosaries at the last moments. A single Soviet soldier lingers in the pit of perhaps hundreds of fallen officers, bayoneting anyone who still might be alive right as a bulldozer piles up mounds of dirt into the graves to cover up their crimes. It is the last scene of the entire movie.

The Germans had it right when they discovered these mass graves in 1943, just months before the advancing Soviet armies would take control of the site, and announcing these atrocities to be the fault of the Russians, but we refused to believe them, as the Russians happened to be our ""ally."" Even when the truth was uncovered, it stayed hidden for years. I have the greatest sympathy for Poland, which had been denied their independence by the Russians and Germans since 1772, and then only given a taste of freedom from 1918 to 1939 before that light was extinguished by the invading Germans and then by the Soviets from 1945 until 1989. This movie is one of the best foreign films I have ever watched, but it's hard to describe the feelings you have when you watch the scene of the massacres.",1302739200,13,2885,4.556840077071291
3134992,4,B0014V8IIK,"Veteran Polish director Andrzej Wajda take on the Katyn Massacre, the 1940 execution in a few days (probably a world record in mass murder) of some 20,000 Polish officers captured during the previous year invasion of Eastern Poland by the Soviet Union (in complicity with Nazi Germany who had invaded the western part of Poland).

As the movie begins, the Polish officers are being transported in trains to the Soviet Union as prisoners. Meanwhile the Germans are also doing mischief in their controlled part of Poland, detaining the professors of Krakow University and sending them to cocentration camps. After a brief interlude in World War II, the movie moves on to the post war. In new communist Poland, when one of the widows of the slain officers tries to inquire to authorities about his fate, she is told is better to kept quiet. The movie ends with a recreation of some of the executions.

Meant primarily for a Polish audience, this is a well made film, with good production values, but also curiously (for lack of a better word and given the subject matter) bloodless (the most moving part of the film is a real Nazi newsreel that shows the mass graves being exhumed by the Germans for propaganda purposes).

Much has been said about the considerable crimes of Germany's National Socialist regime in this era. Poland was not the first to bear the brunt of the Nazi invasions, as Czechoslovakia rightfully claims the status as the first nation to be violated. However, Poland bore a much more thorough burden of suffering than other occupied nations. Brutalized by TWO oppressors, Poland would not be free again, until fifty years later.

Many people are ignorant of the fact that the Soviet Union thoroughly assisted Nazi Germany in the invasion of Poland in 1939. Here we have the true story of a Polish lady, the wife of a prominent army officer. She saw her husband for the last time, in the early days of WWII, as he was about to be shipped off to a Soviet P.O.W. camp. She never saw him again.

Years pass, the war finally ends, the Soviet Union enslaves all of Eastern Europe as vassal states, and still there is no news as to the fate of her husband. Then one day, ...she recieves her husbands diary of events in Soviet captivity...

Thinking it carefully and making a zealous backward glance respect the greatest filmmakers of the last century, just a reduced elite of filmmakers may boast of being regarded authentically integral, legitimately committed with an ethical entity and profoundly convinced that although each generation must make efforts about knowing the composition of their historical land in order to suppress the bad grasses that always tend to hide the abominable truth. Among them Wajda must be part of this elite, accompanied by Robert Bresson, Carl Dreyer, Andre Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles, Fritz Lang, Wilhelm Murnau, Akira Kurosawa, Marcel Carne, Kenji Mizoguchi,  and Roberto Rosellini

If Stalin pursued Trotsky until Mexico to kill him, and without a bit of scruples ordered to confiscate the goods of five millions of farmers through the middle twenties without compensating them inside his own territory and making they starved of hunger, inanition and cold, how many heroes or simple officers have been sent to jail, or aseptically eliminated ? Such is the nature of this veridical event. Once Soviets massacred brutally in 1940 thousand of Polish officers and civilian in the Katyn forest, and the War was over the Soviets pretended to attribute these deaths to the Nazis and pray for all of those who disagree with this decision.

Since the times of ""The man of marble"" , Wajda - that solid oak- and legitimate descendent of the great Polish Romantic tradition, felt the necessity to express and remind this new generation about this bloody, coward and unjustified massacre.

Filmed with astonishing realism, supported by an agile dialogue, the employment of gloomy luminosity to depict the somber mood of the story as well as magnificent performances; the film is viscerally potent and hardly you  will be able to forget it.

3134999,5,B0014V8IIK,"It sounds almost immoral to say this is a ""good"" movie. Horror can never be ""good"".

Everybody knew - since the 1940s - that the of Katyn's perpetrators spoke Russian, but it was silenced because the Soviets were the ""good guys"", the ""allies"". And the only one that raised his voice to accuse Moscow, Vladislav Sikorski, had his plane conveniently brought down by ""technical failure"".

The NKVD henchmen that participated in the massacre (just 20 to 30 agents) knowing the number of executions that they would have to perform (250 per night) for their boss, Lavrenti Beria, asked for German PPK pistols, because their recoil was less painful to their wrists than the heavy Nagant revolver, and because their Tokarev TT-30 was unreliable for the heavy use intended. Besides, the use of German weapons added plausible deniability in case of exhumation of corpses (it seems they could read the future!). The chief NKVD executioner, Vasili Blokhin, a favorite psychopath of Beria, all clad in black leather, is rumored to have killed  - personally - 7.000 of the 22.0000 prisoners. Blokhin and his henchmen ""worked"" for 10 straight hours, giving us an average of 1 murder every 3 minutes. The blood bath prolonged with cold efficiency (NKVD had a lot of practice since the 1930s purges) for 28 days of April 1940.

That's the real dimension of the horror of Katyn.

And this is only an example of the bigger horror that had visited Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus, the Baltic republics since 1918. And after 1945, Ukraine (again), Baltic republics (again), Poland, Germany, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, etc.

Finally, many people miss an important point in this movie, because at the same time that it's a clear indictment against the USSR for genocide against the Polish people, it clearly demolishes the ever present myth that Hitler began the war. It was USSR and Nazi Germany together who began WWII, but UK and France - supposed to be Poland's allies - only declared war against Germany, not the Soviet Union.

Why?

No wonder 1945 wasn't a time for celebration in half of Europe.",1286582400,10,2106,4.963068181818182
3135000,5,B0014V8IIK,"In the spring of 1940, 20,000 people, 12,000 of them Polish officers, were executed under direct orders from Stalin and buried in common graves in the Katyn forest.

The Germans found the graves in 1943, as they advanced into Russia. They exhumed and identified the bodies, and released the names of the dead to the Polish population attributing the massacre to the Soviets. ([...])

But when the war ended, the Soviets who, by then, held Poland with an iron hand blamed the Nazis for the slaughter. As dissidents were tortured and killed, most Polish didn't challenge the official story. Only in the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian president accepted responsibility for the incident.

In the movie Katyn ([...]), Andrzej Wajda (whose father was one of the officers killed in Katyn), recounts this historical event. He does not judge but presents the facts with a dispassionate eye that only enhance the absolute horror of the massacre.

As the movie begins a crowd of civilians, mainly women and children, waits at the end of a bridge. They are fleeing the Nazis invasion. A man runs towards them from the other side of the bridge, yelling, telling them to turn back because the soviets have crossed the border. Panic ensues, and you are there, caught, like Poland was during the war, between the Nazis and the Soviets, two powerful nations intent on victory at any cost.

The Polish government, we soon learn, has capitulated without fighting and surrounded its officers to the Soviets before leaving the country. The officers are taken prisoners, but their fate is sealed. As an officer tells another prisoner on their last Christmas Day, ""They cannot let us go. The soviets wouldn't want 12,000 Polish officers on their back while they fight the Germans"".

The movie, as beautiful and affecting as it is restrained, follows the fate of four officers and the families of three of them. The officers are dead and their families eventually learn of their fate but, as Germans and Soviets blame each other, the truth is hard to know or accept. It's also dangerous.

To say that '1940' is the real date of the massacre means to defy the Soviets that claim the Germans did it in 1942 as they advanced into Russia. Agnieszka, the sister of a young lieutenant who died in Katyn, knows this. Yet she orders a tombstone with the right date to set upon her brother's grave and, for this, she's taken into custody. Her sister, on the other hand, accepts the Soviet version and tries to live under their rule.

It's proof of the genius of the filmmaker that he manages to show both sisters in a sympathetic light. How many compromises, he seems to be telling us, each of us is willing to make in order to survive is an unknown until we are confronted with the choice in real life.

Katyn is a powerful, unforgettable story that needed to be told.",1285977600,8,2860,4.7269076305220885

We start off with a pious officer turning down his imploring family and refusing the chance to escape a chaotic prison camp because he must stay behind with his men. He then whiles away the time writing a diary and chatting with his friends. Meanwhile, his wife manages to escape from Soviet-occupied eastern Poland to the German-occupied west, where things aren't much better. The film is too long and contains a lot of dead air. The characters are not particularly strong or believable and the plotting is weak. At the end, we see (in a series of remarkably explicit scenes) a bunch of officers having the backs of their heads blown off by Soviet agents. One of the Poles survives by becoming a turncoat and doing Moscow's work, and then we see the start of the official effort to blame the Germans for the killing.

The soviet empire was built on lies and brutality. From lenin on the country was a murder machine which only in it's last few decades less bloodthirsty.

Other people would follow them to unknown graves or death camps in siberia in the next ten years.  This movie addresses how the poor polish people had to suffer under a giant system of lies and the worst of them was katyn. This movie looks great on blu ray and metrodome needs to start issuing blu rays in north america because they have  alot of war titles out on blu ray. Great movies like assembly, flame and citron, days of glory and others. All of them are foriegn language films with subtitles and this one is no different. It's a finely acted polish movie made about the massacre and it's aftermath.  It's not a standard war movie though with battle scenes though. It is a solid drama based on facts with characters who are realistic and based on composites of real people.  So be prepared for a drama in which a wife tries to find out what happened to her husband. And that's just one senario.

While Gorbachev acknowledged Soviet responsibility of the massacre of 21,857 Polish officers (and other Polish individuals the Soviets targeted for execution in order to help ensure minimized resistance of the Soviet takeover) in the Katyn forest in 1940, decades of denial by the Soviets (who blamed the German military), and the continued refusal of Russia to describe the event as a war crime for which Stalin himself was responsible, continues to bring heartache to millions of Poles. As quoted by ""The Wall Street Journal"" yesterday, historian Norman Davies remarked that ""Katyn is in a way the most important event in World War II in Polish minds, more so than the Holocaust. People get very angry about this and say it shows Poles are being anti-Semetic. They're not. The difference is that the whole world has been told about the Holocaust"". This reviewer has empathy towards Poles, because as a descendant of the Donauschwaben, public unawareness of the events that occurred during the period immediately following the second world war continues. This screen adaptation of ""Post Mortem: The Story of Katyn"", by Andrzej Mularczyk, deserves the Oscar nomination it received. The start of the film shows Poles frantically running, uncertain where to go, since Poland was surrounded by Soviet forces entering from the east, and German forces entering from the west, and the drawn out aspect of this scene helps the viewer momentarily identify, at least a little bit, with what the situation must have been like. In addition, events are viewed through the perspective of the wives, mothers, and daughters of victims, and the realistic portrayal of family relationships brings a dimension that is often lacking in films of a similar genre. And portions of German newsreels that present the massacre as a Soviet crime, and portions of Soviet newreels that present the massacre as a German crime, are played during this movie, providing some grounding. Given the history surrounding Katyn, it is surprising that Russia aired this movie on prime-time television. Not surprising is that in April 2009 authorities of the People's Republic of China banned this film from being distributed in the country due to ""its ideology being not in line with the official view of the Chinese state"".",1271548800,8,2495,5.132678132678133
3135015,5,B0014V8IIK,"I have little to say as so many people have done an excellent work on covering the historical/political background here. I just want to reflect on the effect this movie had on me. It is dark,dark cinema but cinema which doesn't just tell you the truth, it lets you see it and re-live it together with the characters involved. It does leave you profoundly sad and horrified at the same time and these are hard emotions to bear but it's a price worth paying. People shot in the back of the head and then thrown into a pit to rot...if you haven't had crystal clear concept of what a war crime/crime against humanity is, this masterful work will do it for you. If you ever had any doubts about the dehumanizing nature of a totalitarian society, please see this film. There are the Nazis and there are the Communists and there's not much difference between them. I was 16 when the 1989 changes came to Eastern Europe and I was there and I still remember a lot. I remember being taught by history textbooks that the Germans killed those officers in 1941 and then blamed the Soviets. I remember the skewed propaganda we were fed in lieu of history in general. I remember when the truth came out about the local Gulags set up by the local minions after the Glorious Soviet Model;the mass executions following the first weeks of Communist takeover; Wells and mines clogged with the rotting bodies of people who wouldn't fit in the new system as they were too decent to even pretend to go along. I'm not Polish but if I ever felt like one it was after the final scenes were over and I just couldn't sleep. The persuasive power of ""Katyn"" will leave you grasping for answers and will touch your deepest fears and hopes at the same time. It's a revelation, not an entertainment. I felt way too real, and that's why in my opinion this film is 5 stars.",1270944000,5,1838,4.440828402366864
3135016,5,B0014V8IIK,"Poland's tragedy is that it was caught in the middle of the 20th century between a paranoid and ideologically ruthless Soviet Union to the east and Nazi Germany to the west, invaded and occupied in turn by both. The Stalinist regime was in one way even more ruthless than the Nazis, who whatever their other murderous excesses did treat the majority of Polish military POWs at the end of the September 1939 war in line with the Geneva Convention. The Soviet regime, in contrast, secretly murdered 22,000 captured Polish army officers and NCOs and later perpetrated a cynical propaganda campaign to blame the crime on the Nazis. Many of the murdered men were not career soldiers but university professors, teachers, lawyers and other professionals on the military reserve list drafted into service in 1939. All were murdered by the NKVD in April and May 1940 by being shot individually through the back of the head, and most of their bodies were buried in mass graves in the forest near Katyn.

Andrzej Wajda's tour-de-force tells the story of the Katyn massacre (some of the victims were murdered at other sites but Katyn was the main location of this monstrous crime) and the subsequent personal and political consequences for the survivors and for Poland. The film is told through a dozen or so characters and is strongly scripted, superbly acted and gripping throughout. The version I saw had the original mainly Polish (but also with some German and Russian) dialogue and was subtitled in English. Shot predominantly in washed-out browns and greens the film has a real period feel and effectively evokes the 1940s when it is set.

The film opens in September 1939 on a bridge with a mass of civilians fleeing east away from the invading German armies meeting others fleeing west away from the invading Soviets. We are introduced to three of the main characters: Anna (the truly excellent Maja Ostaszewska) with her young daughter who has travelled with her across half the country from their home in Krakov to the east to find her husband, a Major in the Polish Army (played by the equally excellent Artur Zmijewski) now held prisoner with several thousand officers and NCOs by the invading Soviets. Loosely guarded at this early stage he passes over the chance to flee with his wife and child and chooses to stay with his colleagues from a sense of honour and his oath to the Army. This proves a fateful decision. The officers and NCOs are then removed to Soviet prison camps and Anna is stuck in the new Soviet zone away from her family in Krakov.

The narrative develops to juxtapose scenes involving different characters in different parts of Poland and how they cope with the new reality. A compassionate Red Army officer from the occupying force billeted with Anna and her daughter illustrates that the planned Soviet hegemony sees intellectuals as potentially sympathetic to democratic ideals and so dangerous elements to be eliminated.

In 1943 the bodies of those massacred at Katyn are uncovered by the Nazis who by then occupy the whole of Poland and half of Russia. The propaganda opportunities are enthusiastically seized on and film of the exhumed bodies is shown to paint the Soviets as ruthless murdering Bolsheviks and the heroic German soldier as noble crusader against Communist-Jewish tyranny. This factual episode from history is used as a turning point in the film for most of the characters.

Nothing is black-and-white: some of the characters are pragmatic (cynical? Self-serving?), some stand up for the truth as they know it and put themselves on the line (foolish? Futile heroics?) The film is even-handed: people face difficult choices according to circumstance and are not judged, but understood.

Wajda saves the real killer scene for the final reel, and the screen then goes dark with only sombre music.

Due to the international political situation, the cold war and the passage of time, no-one was ever brought to book for the crime. The perpetrators, and those who gave the order, were long dead by the time the truth emerged.

Despite the grim and serious subject matter I would recommend `Katyn' unreservedly. It really is a superbly crafted film.",1269734400,5,4187,4.945945945945946

3135018,5,B0014V8IIK,"I watched ""Katyn"" on a home computer screen. Even in that limited format, ""Katyn"" had an impact on me comparable to such cinematic greats as ""Lawrence of Arabia."" I cried throughout most of the film. I resolved that many of my relationships would be different. I remembered people I had known who reminded me of characters in the movie. After the film ended, I felt that I could not listen to the radio or read the newspaper or listen to anyone speak. I just needed to allow the film to sink into me.

Naysayers have critiqued ""Katyn"" as boring and dull. If you need a film to depict war, occupation, and atrocity as shiny, compact, and compelling as a sports car, then you should listen to those naysayers; don't watch ""Katyn,"" rather, watch the very silly, teen fanboy-friendly Quentin Tarantino flic, ""Inglorious Bastards."" If you've seen enough Hollywood productions jam-packed with sexy Nazis and happy endings, and you want to take in a film that dares to depict, in eyeblinks, what war, atrocity, and occupation looked like and felt like to real people, then by all means see ""Katyn."" One of the many features that I admired: ""Katyn""'s Nazis are not sexy. They are not Tom Cruise, Liam Neeson, Christoph Waltz. ""Katyn""'s Nazis are brutal, repugnant thugs.

I respect this movie. There are too few movies about which I'd say that. It shows the courage not to attempt to weave an uplifting, feel-good atrocity narrative that leaves the viewer with a smile. This isn't ""Schindler's List."" ""Schindler's List"" is a very good movie, but this isn't that. It is, rather, very much like what World War Two and the subsequent Soviet occupation sounded like to me when I listened to my own older friends and relatives, who lived through both. This is disjointed narrative, stories that seem headed for redemption or even ecstasy but that end in random death, that end in aborted normalcy, aborted joy, aborted meaning. I felt, in watching these cold, pale, stoic characters, as if I were, once again, sitting across the table from older Eastern European friends and relatives. Yes, that's what they looked like. Yes, those are the facial expressions they assumed when they talked about the uncle who was rounded up and never heard from again, the daring, handsome lad who ended up in a mass grave - or when they pointedly did *not* talk about these people. The gravestone whose inscription dares to tell the truth; the tearing down of a propaganda poster; the Red Army soldier who struggles to do the right thing by a widow, who won't yet admit that she is a widow; the singing of exactly the right Christmas carol at exactly the right moment: those are exactly the heroic gestures that no one ever saw, that went unrecorded, that only one person lived to tell about, to tell me. Here they are, onscreen.

When a movie is named ""Katyn"" the viewer knows how it will end; it's kind of like a movie named ""Auschwitz"" or ""Kolyma"" or ""Wounded Knee."" There isn't going to be a surprise ending. I was still surprised by the ending, by how courageous and moving I found it. Once again, Andrzej Wajda managed to wow the filmgoer in me. And he managed to move the human in me.

See ""Katyn."" See a movie you can respect, a movie that is worth your time.",1267228800,13,3238,4.675438596491228
3135019,4,B0014V8IIK,"The strongest and most unforgettable part of Andrzej Wajda' Oscar nominated film is its final chapter, in which you will witness what happened in the Katyn forest in 1940. Be prepared for one long, graphic scene that depicts most cruel and brutal atrocities committed there. That everything was done in such a methodical way makes the already shocking subject matter more horrifying.

But ""Katyn"" (directed by Wajda who lost his father at Katyn) is also about those who are left behind, especially women: wives and mothers of the officers who disappeared into the forest forever. They do not merely have to wait in fearful anticipation; they also have to fight their own fight, even after the war is over, in the society where the authorities cover up the truths about Katyn.

There are a few too many characters in the complex story, and some sub-plots look unnecessary to me, but those who are more versed in the Polish history might feel otherwise. Most actors did a great job and among them two are standout - Maja Ostaszewska as Anna who believes her missing husband Andrzej is alive, and Andrzej Chyra as Lt. Jerzy who plays an important role when Anna finally knows about the truth about Andrzei and other officers.

My only complaint is that the film is too short. Wajda attempts to encompass so many episodes (well-told and emotionally intense as they are) in a two-hour film, and he even weaves real footage into his fictional drama part. You need more time to fully describe the far reaching tragedy and those who have been deeply affected by it. That point aside, ""Katyn"" is an engrossing, emotional and very personal work from Andrzej Wajda.",1265414400,4,1654,4.816901408450704

3135022,4,B0014V8IIK,"A powerful depiction of the ordeal of Poland during and immediately after WWII.  The focal point is the massacre of Polish POWs by the Soviets in the Katyn forest in 1940.  Wajda and collaborators use the Katyn massacre and characters connected to the massacre to portray the tragedy that befell Poland.  The brutal occupation of what was then eastern Poland by the Soviets, the Nazi liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia, and the Soviet imposition of a Communist state after the war are shown in a series of direct, unsentimental, and powerful scenes.  The central armature of the film is the story of the Polish POWs slaughtered at Katyn, shown through the experience of a single fictional Polish officer. The majority of those killed at Katyn, and this group reputedly included Wajda's father, were reserve officers of middle class  origin who were perceived as enemies of a communist state.  This episode encapsulates the destruction of pre-war Poland that occurred during WWII.

The quality of acting, cinematography, plotting, and even music (featuring work of the great Polish composer Penderecki) is excellent.  Events are presented in a quotidian but cumulatively powerful manner.  The film artfully shows the convergence of many features of Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism.  The great convergence of Catholic faith and Polish nationalism is also shown.  The Polish experience of WWII was the subject of Wajda's early, famous films of the 50s, and there are some references within Katyn to the earlier films.",1261267200,10,1520,5.239669421487603

3135026,5,B0014V8IIK,"Katyn is one place that most Polish people will immediately recognize.  For us in the west, it is a little known World War 2 massacre that oddly enough was perpetrated and executed by Russia.

As far as WW2 massacres go, this is a drop in the bucket when compared to the 5 million Poles killed by Germany and another million Poles killed by Russia during WW2.  What is interesting about this incident is how both the Germans and the Russians used it in their war propaganda.  Add to that the 45 year cold war occupation where the Russians suppressed Polish history, and where the Poles really knew who killed who, and now you have an incident that becomes part of the Polish psyche.

What I liked about this movie is how it flows in time with visits to the past to clear up matters.  This is a nice touch by the master Polish director, Andrzej Wajda, who weaves the tale through the people most affected by the massacre, the victims and their families.

While this movie spans many years, you stay in touch with the families.  Children grow up, mothers get gray hair, and still the story continues.  At this point, many movies would loose focus, but not Katyn.  Wajda keeps tight control over the action and how much knowledge is known.  Like the families, you are kept in the dark about certain things.

Wajda does not overly indulge in sentimentality.  This is not a ""boo-hoo, where's daddy"" type of movie.  This movie is about a country and its people caught up in the giant war and occupation machinery of both Germany and Russia.  This is not an enviable place to be.  Also, Wajda does not use cheap action tricks like big bangs to keep the action and tension going.  This is primarily a historical drama, but when you get caught in the massacre, you'll be riveted, and you'll start praying, too.",1256169600,4,1801,4.543478260869565

3135028,5,B0014V8IIK,"This is a haunting film that has stuck with me for weeks since I first saw it; the kind of film that poses important questions without sacrificing the kind of narrative intensity the subject -- the murder of thousands of Polish officers held prisoner of war by the Soviet Union in the early years of World War II -- demands.

From the opening shot, when a group of refugees fleeing the invading Germans encounters another group coming from the opposite direction and fleeing from the Soviet Union -- which has taken advantage of the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviets to move in and occupy the eastern half of the country -- the stage has been set for the conflict. In the middle are the hapless Poles, with nowhere to turn; their only allies hundreds of miles away in France and England, showing no sign of running to help them. In Krakow, one character, a university professor, is deported to a concentration camp by the Germans; his son, an Army officer, is imprisoned by the Soviets. What is there to choose between them?

The story revolves around the choices made by the characters -- to live or to die, to accept historical distortions in the name of surviving and moving forward with their lives or to deny those in the face of horrific consequences. The film deals with a number of characters -- the wife of a general, the wife of the major, their daughters, their extended family, the two sisters of an engineer turned aircraft designer -- and their lives before, during and after the war, as well as that of one who miraculously escaped the carnage of Katyn forest, but becomes a victim of a different kind.

Initially, some aspects of the film struck me as slightly propagandistic, not so much in the sense of being anti-Soviet (although that is definitely a major theme) but in the sense of Polish nationalist. Still, I was quickly caught up in the story, thanks to the director's wisdom in noting that it is systems and people who adhere to those systems in a rigid way who are to blame, rather than individuals. While both the Soviets and the Nazis are displayed as despicable, it is a Soviet officer who performs a remarkable service for one of the army officer's wives early on in the story.

What is truth, and to what extent will people insist on their right to the truth when the price to be paid is nearly total -- freedom, peace of mind, friendship, etc.? Do we owe a greater loyalty to those who are dead, or to ourselves when they are gone and we can no longer do anything for them? Few films have the guts to tackle such complex issues and to do so in an honest fashion. Some of the answers -- as portrayed in the film, at least -- may be idealistic and even a bit unlikely, but such is the grip of the film that this didn't even occur to me until days later, and even then didn't cause me to question my impression of the film.

We know a lot about the Holocaust, thanks to films such as Schindler's List. This film may be the start of a wider-ranging debate about other kinds of war crimes, which, although they don't measure up to the horrors of the Nazi-designed genocide, should not be forgotten. This is definitely a polemical film, with a strong anti-Soviet/anti-Russian message, but it hews very close to what I know of the history of the period, and the wartime and postwar experience of Poland explains much about the current political state of Central Europe.

This is a startling and remarkable film that I'd recommend strongly to anyone with an interest in the period or a taste for cinema (vs Hollywood blockbusters). This isn't a star vehicle; it's an ensemble cast of actors who will be unfamiliar to most in North America, and the story skips quickly from one narrative to the next. It repays the effort. (Some of the subtitles were a bit erratic... but still comprehensible.) The final scenes are among the most chilling I have ever witnessed in my life.",1255305600,8,3919,4.559659090909091

The habit of Mr wajda to shift all the time from a period or a group of characters to an other, added to the fact that the subtitles follow one another so rapidly, is extemely confusing.

Unfortunately, this scene takes place in ...1946. Where was Wajda's script girl, for gods sake?

And actually no; it's not a minor flaw. Since most of the plot revolves around what a difference a date makes, this stupid little gaffe self-mockingly sabotages the movie's entire case: ""1940, 1941, Nazis, Soviets ...so what? Who cares? Not even the filmmaker! See?""

Aside from that this film is a must, and I concur with the reviewer who says it's the kind of movie Hollywood would never make. Compare it with the false platitudes of, say, ""The Good German"" and you'll see how far Tinseltown is willing to lie rather than be branded ""politically incorrect"" by some showbiz sage still in mourning for the Rosenbergs.

Called to do their patriotic duty, they represented the core of the Polish professional elite, from professors to doctors and lawyers and businessmen and were thus a core potential threat to the suzerainty of Soviet power in the newly conquered territory.  On Stalin's orders, they were bussed into the forest, each shot in the back of the head and dumped in a mass grave.

3135034,5,B0014V8IIK,"World War II stories seem to never end, but ""Katyn"" is a new and extremely important part of world history.  Directed by Oscar winning director Andrzeg Wajda, this two-hour masterpiece is a witness to courage and tragedy at their extremes.

In 1939, Poland occupants are surrounded by the Germans to the west and the Russians to the east.  This is an inescapable situation for the Poles.  There are several families situations that are weaved throughout this film with wife's and daughters searching for their Polish officer husbands, brothers, relatives and friends.  This sets the tone of the film, and personalizes it.  First a wife and daughter find their Polish officer husband as they flee the Germans, only to see him disappear.  A University is visited and the professors are asked to meet with the Russians; a fatal mistake but unavoidable.  Officers and intellectuals are held at various camps, waiting to be executed.

In 1940, the Russians murder most of the Polish officers, while letters, rumors and messages are spread from camps to families and back.  It is painful to watch.  The Germans exploit Russia's murderous rampage to gain allies.  Meanwhile, Polish residents are forced to sign allegiance to Russia, but there is a resistance, which is eventually fatal for most.  Director Andrzej Wajda weaves real footage of the discovery of mass graves to the Polish people (actors) in town squares.  (The films are authentic and Wajda splices them perfectly from black and white into the color film).  These films are the most horrific one will see, even in documentaries.  Polish officers are shown being systematically executed in the most egregious style.  This is interweaved with families contemplating what happened or actually finding out the demise of their husbands and sons.  It is heartbreaking.

The ending with the actually reenactment of the Polish armies being executed in mass graves while bulldozers  bury the evidence is startling and upsetting.  The final scene with a hand holding a rosary is devastating.  The film is one of the most factual (although the family dynamics are fictional) that one can witness.  Its the kind of film that you understand, can relate to and pulls you in every direction.  You know this happened 70 years ago, but the reality is palpable and upsetting.  There are no light moments - this is the real world.  It is a tribute to the people of Poland and their bravery.

This film is for fans of history and the truth.  To date, approximately 22,000 Poles have been found in mass graves in the ""Katyn"" forest and these mass grave discoveries are continuing to be found.",1253491200,9,2628,4.979310344827586

3135036,4,B0014V8IIK,"I read about the mass killing at Katyn Forest years ago.  I had read what I could about the Holocaust more out of disbelief than curiosity.  When I came across the account of Katyn, I was surprised to discover another player in the category of World War II inhumanity.  The Soviet Russians were responsible for the Katyn mass murder of 12000 Polish officers.  They committed this heinous crime presumably because they wanted to eliminate the leaders of the country they had recently invaded; fewer leaders, fewer problems.  What made the whole tragic episode even more bizarre was the Third Reich's publicizing the massacre when they came across the scene in their invasion of Russia.

What I anticipated out the movie ""Katyn"" was an account of the tragedy with fictional characters to bring to life (and death) the humanity and inhumanity.  What I got from ""Katyn"" was all that plus an appreciation for the Polish perspective of a national tragedy that was compounded by having to live for decades under the iron rule of the perpetrators.  Director Andrzej Wajda has done a superb job of bringing out the emotions of the Poles.  I knew of the horror but I learned of the sorrow and anger.",1252886400,5,1189,4.78921568627451

I was just numb after watching such an atrocity, and was left with a thousand unanswered questions. I researched this event on the internet to find more answers and was shocked by the facts surrounding the Katyn massacre. For example - how does one Russian alone murder more than 6,000 men by shooting them point-blank in the back of the head... and live with himself? I watched every minute of the extras included on the DVD (all included English subtitles) and felt as though I could not learn enough of this horrible atrocity and the cover-up that lasted almost 50 years. It wassn't until 1989 when Mikhail Gorbachev, then President of the U.S.S.R., finally released documentation substantiating Stalin himself gave the order to carry out this massacre. My heart-felt thanks and appreciation is extended to all those involved in bringing this story to the big screen, and my sympathy is extended to the survivors of those murdered.

3135038,3,B0014V8IIK,"The movie was good but disappointing.

The start was good as it showed Poland invaded and defeated on both sides - NS Germany on the West, Soviets on the East.

That part was good and I felt I was in time, seeing a rough time from the Polish perspective.

But then it all gets hazy - there is no clear time line of German driving back Soviets and occupying all of Poland, there is no feel for what it was like for Poles on German occupation except one scene where an SS officer insults the Polish academics.

My take on history was that many or even most Poles thought Soviets were more brutal, their occupation worse than Germans - who shared anti Bolshevik, Christian Europe sympathies.

But Poland was also close enough to Western Democracies, had good contacts in England US to have some realistic hope of being independent of both NS German occupation and Communists.

Anyway, that's history.

Another decent part is towards the end when Poland is under Soviet control after the war and Poles have to either accept the situation, make compromises to live get jobs or suffer extreme persecution.

One of the main compromises is that Poles must not say, write or think anything negative about the Soviet's actions against Poland in World War II, the worst being the mass murder of captured Polish officers at Katyn.

I am not sure the brutal murders of Polish officers by Soviets in Katyn should have been done at the end - but maybe it has the most effect.

But, the movie is still well worth watching - true history about Eastern Europe during and after WWII will not be found in Hollywood movies. All we get is the Germans are all evil - the 6 Million etc.",1251676800,2,1662,4.528428093645485
3135039,5,B0014V8IIK,"It takes a brave film-maker to direct such a controversial topic.  At last, one would hope, this heinous massacre has been laid bare.  Movies don't get any better than this!",1251590400,,173,4.733333333333333
3135040,4,B0014V8IIK,"During World War II, the citizens of Poland found themselves caught in a squeeze play of epic proportions - between the Nazis in the west and the Stalinists in the east, with each of the two superpowers intent on subsuming the defeated nation into its own sphere of influence.  Both invaders posed a serious threat to the innocent civilians who lived there and none more so than the wives and family members of officers serving in the Polish army.

""Katyn,"" the Oscar-nominated film by Andrej Wajda, tells of two such women, Anna (Maja Ostaszewska) and Roza (Danuta Stenka), whose husbands (Artur Zmijewski, Andrzej Chyra) are taken prisoner by the Russian army in late 1939.  Then, in the spring of 1940, in the depths of the Katyn Forest in western Russia, the Soviet guards turned their guns on their captives, shooting down thousands of unarmed men one by one, then burying their bodies in a shallow mass grave.  For years, the Nazis used the massacre as a propaganda tool against the Soviets, but with the defeat of the Nazis and the eventual Communist takeover of Poland, it became the Soviets' turn to exploit the tragedy by declaring the Nazis responsible for the atrocity, even going so far as to move the date of the event to late 1941.  It wasn`t until the eventual overthrow of the Soviets in Poland in the late 1980s that the long-buried truth could finally be revealed.

""Katyn"" is an understated, deeply humanistic and superbly acted look at an event that has haunted the Poles for generations.  Veteran director Wajda doesn't go in for grand gestures or cheap sentiment to relate a tale that he knows will open up a gaping moral wound in the psyche of his intended audience.  Instead, the characters in this movie confront the horrors of their lives with an almost matter-of-fact calmness and acceptance, the result, no doubt, of having already experienced death and suffering on an almost daily basis for years up to that point.  All the characters in this film are to some extent victims of their circumstances and of the cruel vagaries of fate, yet even within the proscribed limits of their situations, many still choose to act on their convictions and to try to determine, as much as possible, the course of their own lives and the future of their nation.

The screenplay could use a little more streamlining and clarity at times; certain characters pop up seemingly out of nowhere only to fade into the background never to be heard from again.  Yet, despite the somewhat muddled nature of the narrative, the movie shows just how far people are willing to go in denying reality, especially when their reasons for doing so involve fear of governmental retaliation, guilt for having stood by and allowing the atrocity to happen in the first place, patriotic fervor for the homeland, or the desire to simply abandon the past and get on with one's life.  Yet, the movie shows us that in all places and times, and no matter how great the threat or dire the circumstances, there will always be brave people willing to put their lives on the line for truth and justice.

This is a subtle movie that, in its own subdued, quiet way, will worm its way into the very center of your soul.  And it ends with a horrifying and profoundly moving scene that will leave any viewer with a heart and a conscience staring at the screen in stunned silence.",1251590400,7,3355,4.712820512820513
3135041,5,B0014V8IIK,"From the first frame till the poignant last scene, this is a movie I shall not soon forget. It is a compelling account of the Katyn massacre of 1940, where the Soviet NKVD, under Stalin's orders, murdered more than 20,000 Polish officers, educators, and various intellectuals. The movie is a cinematic triumph, masterfully directed by Andrej Wajda, whose own father was a victim of the massacre.

The movie itself plays out in three parts - the first focuses on the events in the early days of the war in 1939. Polish citizens are portrayed fleeing from the Germans on one side and the Russians on the other, meeting somewhere in the middle and not knowing where to go, as either way spells danger and doom. In the fracas, there is a mother and her young daughter who are looking for the husband and father, a cavalry captain in the Polish army. When they eventually find him, he refuses to leave with them, citing his loyalty to his fellow officers and the army. Time passes, and these Polish officers find themselves incarcerated by the Russians, awaiting an unknown fate. Later, the Germans reveal the horrors of Katyn, blaming the Russians and using it as propaganda in favor of their war efforts. The second part of the movie is about what happens after the war - Poland is under a new government, loyal to the Soviets [more of a puppet government] and Katyn is blamed on the Germans, though witnesses, family members of the murdered and those who do not buy into the new establishment know differently - the truth of Katyn, i.e. that the murders were committed by the Soviets. Yet, those who oppose find themselves in grave peril, as one notable character in the movie says ""I choose to be with the murdered, and not the murderers."" A choice that carries a high price indeed.

The final part is the most tragic as it follows the doomed on their journey towards death and the murder pits which are to be their graves. These scenes are harrowing to say the least, and the director does an excellent job in capturing the bewilderment,incredulity, and dawning horror on the faces of the condemned men. This is one of the most compelling WW II movies I've ever seen, which is saying a lot since I have watched many, especially those dealing with the Holocaust. It has been a long time coming, since not many movies have been made about this horrifying and tragic incident in history and I believe Andrej Wajda's ""Katyn"" is destined to become a classic.",1251158400,12,2453,4.649769585253456
3135042,5,B0014V8IIK,"My great uncle is identified as body number 758 of those dug up from the pits at Katyn Forest and identified. I therefore could relate strongly to this powerful movie. There were few happy endings for Poles during and after World War II, and unlike Hollywood movies, this film shows the stark reality of the situation for Poles caught between the brutality of the Germans and the Soviets. Both my great uncle and grandfather were officers (doctors) with the army reserve who were mobilized in August 1939. Both were rounded up with their units by the Soviets and separated from other ranks. My grandfather managed to escape when they were first rounded up and before the rest were transported elsewhere, but like the officer in the movie, my great uncle decided to stay with the other officers. No one ever saw him again. When the pits were dug up, we believe the Germans sent for his wife and youngest daughter to help in the idenfication. They were never seen again either. This movie is faithful to the history as we now know it and to the story as I heard it growing up in London surrounded by emigre Poles. It's time the rest of the world understood what went on in Poland during this dreadful time in its history.

Not long after his escape, my grandfather, along with my grandmother and father (at age 14), were rounded up and deported to Siberia as slave laborers (along with 1.5 million other Poles, roughly half of whom did not survive). My father has written a memoir of his experiences in the labor camp and his journey to freedom.

I must have seen several thousand movies in my life, but never has one left me shattered as Katyn did. (Full disclosure: years ago I knew a Polish family caught up in the events of September 1939, so I was ripe to be blown away by the opening minutes of the film, never mind the ending.)

If Katyn--the film and the massacre--has a moral, the moral is this: IT'S NOT OVER WHEN IT'S OVER. The shockwaves go on for years, decades, generations.

And perhaps this: the crime was not the murder of thousands of Polish officers and sergeants by the Russians, who wanted to clear the way for their takeover of Poland. The crime was what the Soviet Union did to Poland the half-century from 1939 to 1989. Blue skies! -- Dan Ford",1250899200,7,790,4.324324324324325

I called it disturbing and it really is along the lines of ""Schindler's"" List.  It is also a poignant historical lesson that is as important today as it was when these events occurred.

Without giving away any of the details, the movie follows a number of people who help bring the story and the history to life.  The story is well constructed although it was a little difficult for me to keep the storylines absolutely clear, particularly in the middle of the movie.  But don't despair, the final third of the movie is very well done and yes, I was moved to tears and horrified while deeply appreciative to be an American with the freedoms we enjoy.

The cinematography is very well done, the historical accuracy appears very good (I am not an expert on the era), and the acting is solid -- the story itself, terrifyingly beautiful.  I'd recommend this film to those who appreciate great movies.

3135047,4,B0014V8IIK,"KATYN is an heart-wrenching revelation of a little known Soviet Army atrocity that obliterated much of WWII Poland's middle & upper class male population.  By watching the nearly 50-minute Special Feature interview with director Andrzej Wajda it stunned me to discover that the film is portraying for the first time to Polish and international audiences a shocking story of the long-covered up execution-style murders of 20,000 Army officers, priests, policemen, business owners, alleged spies, and others who made up the intellectual, military, industrial and religious sectors of Poland.

Wajda's masterful directorial touch presents the story of this sinister slaughter principally from the point of view of 2 wives and young daughters of Polish officers.  Anna (Maja Ostaszewska), is the wife of an Army cavalry captain who keeps a detailed diary of his imprisonment -- from his initial transport by train from Krakow until the day of his execution in a remote area known as Katyn.  The other wife is Roza, the wife of a Polish general who is sent by train to a Soviet detention camp with thousands of his own troops.

Wajda, whose own father was killed in the Katyn massacre, captures the angst and despondency of the women and daughters at the disappearance and complete secrecy regarding the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones (husbands & fathers).  Wajda, who was a young teen at the time of the evacuation, ruefully mentions to the Special Feature interviewer the emotional impact on him and his own mother regarding the displacement, absence and eventual death of his father.  Such personal grief as his mother's and his own seems to strongly have influenced the point of view that he decided to portray in the film.

The acting of the entire cast is powerful.  Of special note is Andrzej Chyra, a well-known Polish actor, who gives a nuanced performance as an Army lieutenant.  Chyra, as Lt. Jerzy Porucznik befriends the cavalry major (Artur Zmijewski) shortly before the 2 are separated.  One brief interaction between the 2 officers results in a distressing turn of affairs that leads to added turmoil for Anna and her daughter and eventually for Jerzy himself.

The story ends powerfully, as the truth of what occurred at Katyn comes to light, the details of which should be reserved for those who choose to watch this film.  The soundtrack adds to the dramatic moments of the story without overpowering or substituting music for what is to be seen and heard about the characters & situations presented onscreen.",1250380800,6,2538,5.057553956834532
3135048,5,B0014V8IIK,"I was stunned by the beauty and the awesome skill of this film.  I have not seen a film so perfectly directed, so beautifully acted and stunningly shot since ""Tin Drum"".  Literally, there is not one instance in this film that I would change.  It is literally - perfect.

On the movie disc, there is an interview with Polish director Wajda who explains that his own father was one of the Katyn victims.  Wajda relates how he then watched his own mother die of grief after the war when she finally realized that her husband was dead.  Wajda explained that this colored his interpretation of the movie whereby the bulk of those survivors who struggle to come to grips with the horror of the Katyn massacre are almost all women.  (Then again, who else was left behind to cope with it?)

This film is a masterpiece.  And believe me, I do not say that lightly.  I watch at least 3 films a week, sometimes as many as 5, so I am sadly aware of the dearth of decent films out there.  At least half (if not more) of the films I watch have me pushing the 'fast forward' button within the first 5 minutes of watching.  Not this film.

3135049,5,B0014V8IIK,"This was probably the biggest national heartbreak suffered by a single country other than the Holocaust.  It happened when Stalin ordered the NKVD to ""liquidate"" the captured Polish POW's who had the misfortune of being captured by Timoshenko's troops instead of Guderian's or Runstedt's. The ""4th Partition Of Poland"" created a problem for the western allies that would not resurface until 1942 when Stalin's government, who adamantly refused the recognized legitimate government-in-exile in London's request to send the Swiss and the Red Cross over to what the Germans discovered at Katyn.  The Soviets told the world it was a German Atrocity while the Nazis were telling the world that it was a Soviet Atrocity.  Only the Poles and Soviets knew the real truth and no Nazi forensics was going to tell anybody different. The Poles because it affected their families directly when they lost contact with their loved ones captured by the Red Army. The Soviets because they knew exactly who gave the orders as well as who carried those orders out--afterward, many of them who committed the executions themselves would be slaughtered by their co-workers on orders of their superiors.  What few survivors there were from the executioners' side were either discredited because of their mental imbalances or they drunk themselves to their deaths.  It was the lies of Katyn that compelled Stalin to break relations with the London Government as well as work to crush the Polish Home Army that was loyal to it. The Home Army fought and died with the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto against the Germans while Rokossovsky's troops were ordered to stand back and let the Germans take out the last vestige of Pilsudski's and Paderewski's Pre-War Poland. Once it was clear that the Germans effectively eradicated all Polish military resistance, The Stavka gave the order with Stalin's blessing for Rokossovsky's forces to take Warsaw from the Germans and continue their drive to the west to take up as much land as possible before the Americans and the British take it.

Katyn was the fulcrum by which the Polish people would judge their experience under Communist rule, first under Soviet Occupation and then as a Soviet satellite, a forced ally despite centuries of mistrust between them.  The lies of Katyn that compelled Stalin to set up the Lublin Government in 1942 to counter the London Government and when Rokossovsky took Warsaw, the Lublin Government became the de-facto government of Poland--even though many in its government, including its Minister of Defense, Konstantin Ustinovich Rokossovsky himself, were not Poles.  Because of Katyn, many Poles after the war did not respect the Polish Government as their legitimate government, Let alone the PRP, the Polish Communist Party.

The Polish Governments of Wladislaw Gomulka, Stanislav Konya, Edvard Gierek, Konya again and Wojciech Jaruzelski had to walk a balancing act between the Polish people and the Soviets despite the fact that the rest of the world did recognize Gomulka's government as the official government of Poland in the mid-1940s.  It was fait accompli that made it happen, brought about by a Soviet victory which further tried to bury Katyn to the Poles and the rest of the world--even though the rest of the world knew the truth.  Churchill even wrote about it in his history of the Second World War.

It wasn't until Gorbachev became General Secretary in Moscow and his calls for openness after the Chernobyl disaster that forced a discussion about Katyn in both Poland and the Soviet Union.  The Poles also learned other truths about their leaders as well, especially Jaruzelski, who during that time was arrested by Smersh troops and and hauled off to a gulag in Siberia, only to be rehabilitated after the war and brought into the ranks of the new Polish Army and the PRP. By discussing the subject of Katyn, the Poles confirmed their beliefs in their common loss, which until this time was considered a loss suffered by specific families.  By this time, the Polish government found itself in an untenable position with their own people and without Gorbachev and his government to support them further. If it was the will of the people to undo their government by either coup or reform, the Red Army would not stand in the way. The only guarantee that Gorbachev would give to Poland was that their territorial integrity especially against Germany would be defended.

Jaruzelski had to give opposition parties more legitimacy and even had to allow for the possibility that the PRP could lose its monopoly on political power, especially when the government thus far failed to deliver prosperity to the people it served.  He also had to allow for the possibility that he may also be tried for crimes either for what he did in World War II or even afterward.  The government was between a rock and hard place.  Eventually, that government dissolved peacefully and the opposition parties gathered together with the PRP's successor party, the USDRP.  In the early-1990s, even Jaruzelski tried to paint himself as a reformer in the Gorbachev mold, but his past caught up to him, especially what he did in 1981 trying to squelch the Solidarity movement.

The lessons of Katyn are that no matter how deep one tries to bury the truth behind an atrocity, It will always be in the background and will determine how one perceives people who either built the lies or benefited from them. Katyn founded Post-War Poland twice--first in 1942 by its lies and then in 1990 by its truth.",1248998400,95,5535,4.982646420824295
3135050,5,B0014V8IIK,"Andrzej Wajda's masterpiece, KATYN, is now finally widely available. It was once nominated for the Oscar, and is a very moving, educational, and thought-provoking film.

The movie begins with the German-Soviet conquest of Poland in 1939. The viewer senses the actions of the aggressors through the eyes of the civilians.

But this is only the beginning of Poland's sufferings. Both enemies of Poland begin their genocide of Poles with the best of Polish society. The Germans invite some professors to the university, only to promptly arrest them (for shooting, or slow deaths in concentration camps). The Soviets hold the captured officers and intellectuals at places such as Kozielsk, where the prisoners sing Christmas carols in December 1939. It will be their last Christmas. By spring 1940, the Soviets decide to shoot nearly all of the captive Polish officers.

The movie also shows the life of relatives of the Soviet-held men. First there are the letters, and hope for a speedy reunion. Then...silence. Finally, the Germans break the news of their discovery of the Katyn mass graves, and exploit it for propaganda purposes--hoping to divide the Allies. The relatives face the fact that their men will never return.

After the war, the suffering of the Katyn relatives continues. Information about the exact fate of the missing men is skimpy. The Soviet puppet state, using the Communist terror police (the UB), tries to force the grieving relatives to sign a statement blaming the Germans for the crime. The relatives also face pressure from others to ""accept reality"" that Poland will never again be free, and must align itself with Soviet dictates. They refuse. Then they have problems sending their son to the university because they won't bow to the Soviet lie about Katyn.

Polish movies tell it like it was, and often don't have a happy ending. WARNING: This movie has graphic scenes of the Polish officers being shot and blood being spilled. This may upset sensitive viewers. These scenes come near the end of the movie, as the victims are trucked to the sites of death, and, one-by-one, shot point-blank in the back of the head. The beginnings of the ""Our Father"" are the last words on their lips.

(The Soviet government did not officially admit that the killings were ordered by Stalin until 1990.)

Wajda's masterful film centers on this dismal episode by revealing the webs of commitment and interaction that connect disparate lives - from an impetuous youth, to the staid wife of an executed general. Most all of the movie is an examination of these connections, of how lies and fabrications feed terror, of how in war there are seldom good choices between right and wrong. Only in the closing minutes, after all the victims have been deeply humanized, is the brutal, machine-like horror of the killings brought to center stage. The effect is powerful and profound.

The misty cinematography, in hues of brown and grey, evokes the mood and texture of wartime. Characters are richly drawn, and if at times the sudden introduction of new faces is confusing, it is only until one realizes Wajda's intent: these people could be any of us.

3135057,5,B0014V8IIK,"Andrzej Wajda's masterpiece, KATYN, was once nominated for the Oscar. It is a very moving, educational, and thought-provoking film.

The movie begins with the German-Soviet conquest of Poland in 1939. The viewer senses the actions of the aggressors through the eyes of the civilians.

But this is only the beginning of Poland's sufferings. Both enemies of Poland begin their genocide of Poles with the cream of Polish society. The Germans invite some professors to the university, only to promptly arrest them (for shooting, or slow deaths in concentration camps). The Soviets hold the captured officers and intellectuals at places such as Kozielsk, where the prisoners sing Christmas carols in December 1939. It will be their last Christmas. By spring 1940, the Soviets decide to shoot nearly all of the captive Polish officers.

The movie also shows the life of relatives of the Soviet-held men. First there are the letters, and hope for a speedy reunion. Then...silence. Finally, the Germans break the news of their discovery of the Katyn mass graves, and exploit it for propaganda purposes--hoping to divide the Allies. The relatives face the fact that their men will never return.

After the war, the suffering of the Katyn relatives continues. Information about the exact fate of the missing men is skimpy. The Soviet puppet state, using the Communist terror police (the UB), tries to force the grieving relatives to sign a statement blaming the Germans for the crime. The relatives also face pressure from others to ""accept reality"" that Poland will never again be free, and must align itself with Soviet dictates. They refuse. Then they have problems sending their son to the university because they won't bow to the Soviet lie about Katyn.

Polish movies tell it like it was, and often don't have a happy ending. WARNING: This movie has graphic scenes of the Polish officers being shot and blood being spilled.

3369436,3,B0014V8IIK,"I bought the region 2 version in Poland, which is Polish with English subtitles, since I could not wait any longer for the US version to go on sale here.

The Polish people deserve a better movie, and certainly a better musical score, to tell this important story. What a shame!

First, this seemed more like a TV movie or mini-series, in terms of video and sound quality, than a film.

Secondly, I and several others viewing this together for the first time, were first struck by the way in which the ""suffering"" was displayed in the film. The wives and children left behind by the Polish officers were supposed to be going thru extreme deprivation, mental torture, angst and fear, while waiting so many years to hear the fate of their loved ones. But that is poorly shown here. The children have good clothes, food, and get to go to school. The families have nice homes and in some cases live with relatives who look after the kids. People have jobs, public transport is still operating regularly, shops are open. People still get to go to the parks and public squares. This is war, against an oppressed people, whose country is occupied by a hated enemy? I was truly confused.

Third, the god-awful score--intrusive and distracting, cartoonish and over-the-top--takes so much away from the film. I wish I could have viewed it without music at all.

There are some excellent actors in this film, and except for a few notable scenes, their talents are wasted.

The finest among them do their best with the poor dialogue and seeming lack of direction. Especially the very fine actors playing the Red Army captain harboring Anna and her daughter, the actress playing Anna--truly wonderful--and the male actors playing three of the four featured Polish soldiers: Andrzej, Jerzy and the general. Everyone else seems to be overacting, or acting for the first time.

3369462,5,B0014V8IIK,"I saw Katyn when it was commercially released in the U.S.  It made a strong impression on me at the time, but what's interesting is that since then, it's never really left the very back of my mind.  I would never pretend that I've seen the majority of Wajda's movies or even a minority of them (I recall three), but this is truly a great film.  But I also believe that the film's actual agenda has not been discussed in any reviews or comments about the movie I've seen.

I believe that the actual story of the Katyn Forest Massacre is the backdrop to what the film is really about.  Don't get me wrong, it's certainly front and center in the story, and thankfully Wajda does not concoct some silly improbable romance as a way of telling a difficult story.  But what I saw in the movie seemed less to me about Katyn pure and simple, than a discussion of the nature of the impossible choices Poland was facing post-war when the Soviets were completely in control.

What the film does masterfully is successfully convey the impossibilities of living with either the Nazis or the Soviets, and the actual brutalities experienced.  Once World War 2 was over and the Soviets were in control, citizens in Poland has two choices:  cooperate with the Soviet regime and survive, or oppose it (however hopelessly and ineffectively) and get crushed.  What the film shows over and over again in the post-WW2 scenes is that those that tried to resist, however futilely, were destroyed.  The only path forward, the film argues, was cooperation and collaboration.

My best guess is that in post-Soviet Poland, a line of argument has emerged in popular discussion that many in the society were guilty of working against Poland's self-interests in the manner that they co-existed or even collabored with the Soviet regime.  I suspect that Wajda's agenda in this movie is to answer that charge, coming from someone who chose the cooperation pathway.  Certainly anyone who's seen ""Man of Marble"" is not going to argue that Wajda was a true-believer in the system, while certainly being integrated in some manner into the power structures of Poland at the time.  But the point that Katyn makes so strongly is, there was no other path forward other than to cooperate with the regime, or to be crushed.

This is an intelligent, provocative, and extremely powerful movie.  I was cognizant of the fact while seeing the film that I was watching a master at work.  This is a movie that shows a life's worth of experience, and a lesser or younger filmmaker could not have made it.

The Germans themselves were just starting production of this pistol in 1940, after the transition from the Walther HP.  A very minor point.  Saving the visuals and drama of the executions until the final moments of the film was most effective.  The lies of the Soviet murders and cover-up continued for about 50 years.

Everything in the film is very didactic; the objective being not to forget the massacre perpetrated by the Russians in 1940 and how the Polish people had to live a lie for several decades.

Even though the movie is fiction, it is best seen as a dramatised documentary about one incident in the second world war. So unless you are Polish or a history buff you will not like this film.

That is not to say that you should not see the movie. In some way it is good that we are getting movies showing the suffering of other people than the Jews. I am not belittling the killing of millions of Jews, but in my opinion we need more stories highlighting the suffering of Poles, Russians, Germans, homosexuals, Singaporeans, Chinese, etc. The Poles never had a rich diaspora so this movie had to wait a long time to be produced.

I felt that the ending of the movie was particularly poignant when the Polish officers prayed the Lord's Prayer as they were led to execution.

3369481,5,B0014V8IIK,"In 1940 Stalin had the NKVD murder some 15,000 Polish officers who fell into Soviet hands when the USSR belatedly joined in the German invasion of Poland. This is not just the story of the crime itself, which is brutally portrayed on the screen, but of the lies told to cover it up, necessary lies if Poland was to exist as a Soviet satellite.

In the movie four officers and their families are portayed. At first the officers are treated as POWs and many cannot believe that the Russians will harm them, believing as they do that their skills will be needed by the Communist occupiers or that they will be given a chance to continue the fight against the Nazis. They do not reckon with Stalin's paranoia or Beria's (his secret police chief) rather simple solution to those who oppose the regime.

Aside from the murders of the Poles, many of whom had their hands tied with barbed wire and were shot in the back of the head, the director shows the lies which began immediately after the war. The Nazis murdered the officers in 1941 they claimed, following their invasion of the USSR. Anyone who contradicted this idea in the new puppet state, whether student or soldier, would pay a price. The Soviets were liberators. To say otherwise was politically incorrect.

Great direction in this and the acting was superb. Well worth watching.",1326067200,5,1335,4.672340425531915
3369482,4,B0014V8IIK,"You have to feel for the Poles. The Russians have repeatedly raped Poland over the centuries.

The Katyn massacre is one of those items that make up That Which Must Not Be Mentioned about WWII. Another one is that the Soviet Union and the Third Reich were Allies during the first few years of the war as they had agreed to partition Europe between them, starting with Poland. Later, when one of the allies attacked the other one, the original pact of alliance was never mentioned, as being in bad taste if you did.

The Katyn massacre, in particular, made a deep scar in the Polish psyche, more so than the Nazi occupation. Perhaps it was due because Russia invaded the country when it was trying to fight off the German invasion, perhaps because the subsequent occupation by the Communists tried to convince the Poles that the Russians were their friends, perhaps because the Russians refused to acknowledge what everyone knew. Who knows.

The ending of the film is brutal to watch, but it needs to be watched.

Another thing that makes one sick is that the Poles behaved with honor towards the conquerors, not realizing at the time what vicious monsters they were dealing with. Example: (a) the professors naively show up at the university, summoned by the SS officer, only to be brutally rounded up and sent to Sachsenhausen (b) the Polish officers are initially loosely guarded, which means that many could have easily escaped, but did not do so and therefore were subsequently butchered by the Communists.

I did not give it five stars because of one fault that the movie has: to people who are unacquainted with the history, as was the case with my wife, events seem to jump. Had the director simply inserted at the right time in the film what is going on historically, e.g., the pact of alliance between Russia and Germany, the subsequent invasion of Russia by Germany, the occupation of Poland by Russia, etc., the movie would have flowed smoothly.",1320019200,5,1956,4.741176470588235
3369483,5,B0014V8IIK,"This movie is nothing short of excellent. The look, the language and the lessons are not to be missed.  Polish Director Andrzej Pajda does an excellent job of putting fictional clothes on an atrocious, factual event that was almost lost to history.

Its the story of a little known genocide (22,000 slaughtered) that took place during WWII in Katyn Forest. Its the story of how war tears apart families and compromises allegiances.  Its the story of a country's occupation by foreign invaders and its national resistance toward that oppressor.  Finally, its the story of crimes against humanity and the lingering effects on those left behind to mourn their loss.

Pajda was so adept at weaving together the warring threads of three countries (Poland, Germany and Russia) that viewers might find themselves peeking between the soldier's seams to determine who's wearing the uniform. The Politics and Propoganda become apparently real as the movie comes to an unforgettably emotional climax.  I was also impressed by the subtle linkage of one family's story with that of another family. I didn't expect to make sense of some things I saw early in the movie, only to have their meanings illuminated later. The power of an Excellent film!

The DVD Extra which shows an interview with Director Andrzej Wajda is priceless. Here's what he had to say on the importance of education and developing one's self:

""Developing one's self through one's interests or work, making movies, creating an identity, the fact that one searches for people who think alike, is dangerous to any authority because authority always wants subjugation; to agree to everything. It wants an easy society.""

On Patriotism: ""Those who preach it the most, are the least suitable for it.  They have the least, so to say, heart, courage, and judgment to take advantage when the time is ripe.""",1315094400,7,1856,5.0359477124183005
3369484,4,B0014V8IIK,"Katyn, is the revealing prelude of Soviet Russia's plans for Poland, ironically, similar to thos of Nazi Germany. Namely, to eliminate those people in Poland who could possibly be a threat to Soviet takeover of part of that country, after Germany & USSR both invade Poland in 1939, as allies. Germany from the West, Soviets from the East. As a rssult of Poland's defeat at that time, more than 10,000 Polish Army officers fell into Sovit hands. It was a decion of Josef Stalin, Russia's bloodthirsty tyrant to ""liquidate"" (exterminate) these men.

The action takes place in prison camps, and in several Polish cities, as the relatives of the officers were frantic to find out what had happened to their loved ones. Although absorbing, again I felt the editing could have been smoother, as the film seemed to jump around too much.

However, except for the Polish people, few in the world knew or care about the  massacre of Polish Army officers, in the Forest of Katyn, Poland, part of  the horrendous legacy of WWII. Again, except for Poland the same feeling pervades.

It was, both a massacre designed to destroy Poland and a cover up. This film deals with both parts with reference to the murder of the Polish officers which is actually only about a third of the killings.

One point that I did find distasteful in the movie is that Poland before WW2 was a much more diverse society than now. Many that died in Katyn were not Polish Catholics. Large numbers of Orthodox, Jews and some Muslims were among those executed. These people have been written out of the movie.

The acting was not particularly good. Many of the characters development, I thought was weak. The filming was good.

I think it was the strong story line and good directing that made it for me such a good movie.

I particularly liked the killing scenes at the end. It looked very accurate. The officers names checked off, he being taken to the cell, shot in the back of the head  and then being dumped on the trucks.

3369488,5,B0014V8IIK,"I ordered this movie based off the reviews I had read and just finished the movie ten minutes ago. Well, for a while, the movie shows the Polish officers languishing in captivity right up to April, 1940, but their fate remains a mystery for most of the rest of the movie, when the next scenes take place right after the discovery of the mass graves in 1943, and then right after the Russian armies occupied Poland in 1945. You see a lot of the relatives of the missing men as they mourn their loved ones, and some get bitter when the Soviet propaganda films announce about the Germans committing this massacre of 20,000 Polish officers in the summer of 1941, as opposed to the truth about the massacre in April, 1940. For a while, I thought, ""What the hell? Everyone in this movie are all talking about Katyn, but you don't show us exactly WHAT happened to those Polish officers!""

Then right after you see a girl arrested by the secret police in Communist Poland after daring to make a tombstone for her missing brother announcing his death at Katyn on April 10, 1940, the truth is revealed by the recovered entries of her brother's diary, and the last scenes of the movie show the Polish officers then being herded off the train and into buses with blacked-out windows as they're driven deep into a forest about 10 kilometers from Smolensk in western Russia. Then the scenes show the execution of a high-ranking Polish general and other prominent officers deep in some kind of building, where the Soviets throw a fresh bucket of water on the floor to wash away the blood of the murdered men, and the bodies are dumped onto trucks. The rest are herded off the vehicles right up to the burial pits and are murdered with a single bullet through the head, some of them saying their last prayers and holding rosaries at the last moments. A single Soviet soldier lingers in the pit of perhaps hundreds of fallen officers, bayoneting anyone who still might be alive right as a bulldozer piles up mounds of dirt into the graves to cover up their crimes. It is the last scene of the entire movie.

The Germans had it right when they discovered these mass graves in 1943, just months before the advancing Soviet armies would take control of the site, and announcing these atrocities to be the fault of the Russians, but we refused to believe them, as the Russians happened to be our ""ally."" Even when the truth was uncovered, it stayed hidden for years. I have the greatest sympathy for Poland, which had been denied their independence by the Russians and Germans since 1772, and then only given a taste of freedom from 1918 to 1939 before that light was extinguished by the invading Germans and then by the Soviets from 1945 until 1989. This movie is one of the best foreign films I have ever watched, but it's hard to describe the feelings you have when you watch the scene of the massacres.",1302739200,13,2885,4.556840077071291

As the movie begins, the Polish officers are being transported in trains to the Soviet Union as prisoners. Meanwhile the Germans are also doing mischief in their controlled part of Poland, detaining the professors of Krakow University and sending them to cocentration camps.

However, Poland bore a much more thorough burden of suffering than other occupied nations. Brutalized by TWO oppressors, Poland would not be free again, until fifty years later.

Thinking it carefully and making a zealous backward glance respect the greatest filmmakers of the last century, just a reduced elite of filmmakers may boast of being regarded authentically integral, legitimately committed with an ethical entity and profoundly convinced that although each generation must make efforts about knowing the composition of their historical land in order to suppress the bad grasses that always tend to hide the abominable truth. Among them Wajda must be part of this elite, accompanied by Robert Bresson, Carl Dreyer, Andre Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles, Fritz Lang, Wilhelm Murnau, Akira Kurosawa, Marcel Carne, Kenji Mizoguchi,  and Roberto Rosellini

If Stalin pursued Trotsky until Mexico to kill him, and without a bit of scruples ordered to confiscate the goods of five millions of farmers through the middle twenties without compensating them inside his own territory and making they starved of hunger, inanition and cold, how many heroes or simple officers have been sent to jail, or aseptically eliminated ? Such is the nature of this veridical event. Once Soviets massacred brutally in 1940 thousand of Polish officers and civilian in the Katyn forest, and the War was over the Soviets pretended to attribute these deaths to the Nazis and pray for all of those who disagree with this decision.

Since the times of ""The man of marble"" , Wajda - that solid oak- and legitimate descendent of the great Polish Romantic tradition, felt the necessity to express and remind this new generation about this bloody, coward and unjustified massacre.

Filmed with astonishing realism, supported by an agile dialogue, the employment of gloomy luminosity to depict the somber mood of the story as well as magnificent performances; the film is viscerally potent and hardly you  will be able to forget it.

3369496,5,B0014V8IIK,"It sounds almost immoral to say this is a ""good"" movie. Horror can never be ""good"".

Everybody knew - since the 1940s - that the of Katyn's perpetrators spoke Russian, but it was silenced because the Soviets were the ""good guys"", the ""allies"". And the only one that raised his voice to accuse Moscow, Vladislav Sikorski, had his plane conveniently brought down by ""technical failure"".

The NKVD henchmen that participated in the massacre (just 20 to 30 agents) knowing the number of executions that they would have to perform (250 per night) for their boss, Lavrenti Beria, asked for German PPK pistols, because their recoil was less painful to their wrists than the heavy Nagant revolver, and because their Tokarev TT-30 was unreliable for the heavy use intended. Besides, the use of German weapons added plausible deniability in case of exhumation of corpses (it seems they could read the future!). The chief NKVD executioner, Vasili Blokhin, a favorite psychopath of Beria, all clad in black leather, is rumored to have killed  - personally - 7.000 of the 22.0000 prisoners. Blokhin and his henchmen ""worked"" for 10 straight hours, giving us an average of 1 murder every 3 minutes. The blood bath prolonged with cold efficiency (NKVD had a lot of practice since the 1930s purges) for 28 days of April 1940.

That's the real dimension of the horror of Katyn.

And this is only an example of the bigger horror that had visited Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus, the Baltic republics since 1918. And after 1945, Ukraine (again), Baltic republics (again), Poland, Germany, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, etc.

Finally, many people miss an important point in this movie, because at the same time that it's a clear indictment against the USSR for genocide against the Polish people, it clearly demolishes the ever present myth that Hitler began the war. It was USSR and Nazi Germany together who began WWII, but UK and France - supposed to be Poland's allies - only declared war against Germany, not the Soviet Union.

3369497,5,B0014V8IIK,"In the spring of 1940, 20,000 people, 12,000 of them Polish officers, were executed under direct orders from Stalin and buried in common graves in the Katyn forest.

The Germans found the graves in 1943, as they advanced into Russia. They exhumed and identified the bodies, and released the names of the dead to the Polish population attributing the massacre to the Soviets. ([...])

But when the war ended, the Soviets who, by then, held Poland with an iron hand blamed the Nazis for the slaughter. As dissidents were tortured and killed, most Polish didn't challenge the official story. Only in the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian president accepted responsibility for the incident.

In the movie Katyn ([...]), Andrzej Wajda (whose father was one of the officers killed in Katyn), recounts this historical event. He does not judge but presents the facts with a dispassionate eye that only enhance the absolute horror of the massacre.

As the movie begins a crowd of civilians, mainly women and children, waits at the end of a bridge. They are fleeing the Nazis invasion. A man runs towards them from the other side of the bridge, yelling, telling them to turn back because the soviets have crossed the border. Panic ensues, and you are there, caught, like Poland was during the war, between the Nazis and the Soviets, two powerful nations intent on victory at any cost.

The Polish government, we soon learn, has capitulated without fighting and surrounded its officers to the Soviets before leaving the country. The officers are taken prisoners, but their fate is sealed. As an officer tells another prisoner on their last Christmas Day, ""They cannot let us go. The soviets wouldn't want 12,000 Polish officers on their back while they fight the Germans"".

The movie, as beautiful and affecting as it is restrained, follows the fate of four officers and the families of three of them. The officers are dead and their families eventually learn of their fate but, as Germans and Soviets blame each other, the truth is hard to know or accept. It's also dangerous.

To say that '1940' is the real date of the massacre means to defy the Soviets that claim the Germans did it in 1942 as they advanced into Russia. Agnieszka, the sister of a young lieutenant who died in Katyn, knows this. Yet she orders a tombstone with the right date to set upon her brother's grave and, for this, she's taken into custody. Her sister, on the other hand, accepts the Soviet version and tries to live under their rule.

It's proof of the genius of the filmmaker that he manages to show both sisters in a sympathetic light. How many compromises, he seems to be telling us, each of us is willing to make in order to survive is an unknown until we are confronted with the choice in real life.

3369503,5,B0014V8IIK,"this is a review of the blu ray.
The soviet empire was built on lies and brutality. From lenin on the country was a murder machine which only in it's last few decades less bloodthirsty. So when they took over part of poland in a deal with hitler, they were quick to round up those they wanted liquidated. In fact they got rid of the polish officers rather quickly. Other people would follow them to unknown graves or death camps in siberia in the next ten years.  This movie addresses how the poor polish people had to suffer under a giant system of lies and the worst of them was katyn. This movie looks great on blu ray and metrodome needs to start issuing blu rays in north america because they have  alot of war titles out on blu ray. Great movies like assembly, flame and citron, days of glory and others. All of them are foriegn language films with subtitles and this one is no different. It's a finely acted polish movie made about the massacre and it's aftermath.  It's not a standard war movie though with battle scenes though. It is a solid drama based on facts with characters who are realistic and based on composites of real people.  So be prepared for a drama in which a wife tries to find out what happened to her husband. And that's just one senario. The stories continue to shortly after the war when a characters still must make a stand for the truth and they will pay the ulitmate price for it.  So this is not a action movie , it's a good drama about people under tyranny and on blu ray it shines best.",1276041600,3,1522,4.3076923076923075

Instead I watched a well made film, with high production value but completely unengaging. Frankly I was bored.

I can't really tell what is so wrong with it. The story just dragged on and on. I know my history well and this film added nothing to the experience.

I watched it with a good friend equally interested in foreign war movies but for us it was quite a disappointment.

Compared to such brilliant films as Der Untergang (Downfall), Ji jie hao (Assembly) and Tmavomodr svet (Dark Blue World) this film has very little to offer. My recommendation is you watch those instead.",1275004800,4,740,4.583333333333333
3369505,5,B0014V8IIK,"KATYN is one of those films that happens to pop up from obscurity now and then and make everyone wonder just why it never was never lauded properly. Directed and co-written by the brilliant Polish illuminist Andrzej Wajda the film recounts in intense and very credible form the history of the annihilation of 22,000 Polish officers and brilliant scientists, philosopher, and artists in the forest of Katyn in the 1940s, an act that was performed by the Russians but blamed on the Nazis. It was one of the horrors of WW II that served to unite Poland in a manner no other occurrence had. Andrzej Wajda employs a brilliant cast of fine Polish actors to lead us, the audience, into the understanding of how the incident occurred and the few families whose joint efforts managed to uncover the truth.

While Gorbachev acknowledged Soviet responsibility of the massacre of 21,857 Polish officers (and other Polish individuals the Soviets targeted for execution in order to help ensure minimized resistance of the Soviet takeover) in the Katyn forest in 1940, decades of denial by the Soviets (who blamed the German military), and the continued refusal of Russia to describe the event as a war crime for which Stalin himself was responsible, continues to bring heartache to millions of Poles. As quoted by ""The Wall Street Journal"" yesterday, historian Norman Davies remarked that ""Katyn is in a way the most important event in World War II in Polish minds, more so than the Holocaust. People get very angry about this and say it shows Poles are being anti-Semetic. They're not. The difference is that the whole world has been told about the Holocaust"". This reviewer has empathy towards Poles, because as a descendant of the Donauschwaben, public unawareness of the events that occurred during the period immediately following the second world war continues. This screen adaptation of ""Post Mortem: The Story of Katyn"", by Andrzej Mularczyk, deserves the Oscar nomination it received. The start of the film shows Poles frantically running, uncertain where to go, since Poland was surrounded by Soviet forces entering from the east, and German forces entering from the west, and the drawn out aspect of this scene helps the viewer momentarily identify, at least a little bit, with what the situation must have been like. In addition, events are viewed through the perspective of the wives, mothers, and daughters of victims, and the realistic portrayal of family relationships brings a dimension that is often lacking in films of a similar genre. And portions of German newsreels that present the massacre as a Soviet crime, and portions of Soviet newreels that present the massacre as a German crime, are played during this movie, providing some grounding. Given the history surrounding Katyn, it is surprising that Russia aired this movie on prime-time television. Not surprising is that in April 2009 authorities of the People's Republic of China banned this film from being distributed in the country due to ""its ideology being not in line with the official view of the Chinese state"".",1271548800,8,2495,5.132678132678133
3369512,5,B0014V8IIK,"I have little to say as so many people have done an excellent work on covering the historical/political background here. I just want to reflect on the effect this movie had on me. It is dark,dark cinema but cinema which doesn't just tell you the truth, it lets you see it and re-live it together with the characters involved. It does leave you profoundly sad and horrified at the same time and these are hard emotions to bear but it's a price worth paying. People shot in the back of the head and then thrown into a pit to rot...if you haven't had crystal clear concept of what a war crime/crime against humanity is, this masterful work will do it for you. If you ever had any doubts about the dehumanizing nature of a totalitarian society, please see this film. There are the Nazis and there are the Communists and there's not much difference between them. I was 16 when the 1989 changes came to Eastern Europe and I was there and I still remember a lot. I remember being taught by history textbooks that the Germans killed those officers in 1941 and then blamed the Soviets. I remember the skewed propaganda we were fed in lieu of history in general. I remember when the truth came out about the local Gulags set up by the local minions after the Glorious Soviet Model;the mass executions following the first weeks of Communist takeover; Wells and mines clogged with the rotting bodies of people who wouldn't fit in the new system as they were too decent to even pretend to go along. I'm not Polish but if I ever felt like one it was after the final scenes were over and I just couldn't sleep. The persuasive power of ""Katyn"" will leave you grasping for answers and will touch your deepest fears and hopes at the same time. It's a revelation, not an entertainment. I felt way too real, and that's why in my opinion this film is 5 stars.",1270944000,5,1838,4.440828402366864
3369513,5,B0014V8IIK,"Poland's tragedy is that it was caught in the middle of the 20th century between a paranoid and ideologically ruthless Soviet Union to the east and Nazi Germany to the west, invaded and occupied in turn by both. The Stalinist regime was in one way even more ruthless than the Nazis, who whatever their other murderous excesses did treat the majority of Polish military POWs at the end of the September 1939 war in line with the Geneva Convention. The Soviet regime, in contrast, secretly murdered 22,000 captured Polish army officers and NCOs and later perpetrated a cynical propaganda campaign to blame the crime on the Nazis. Many of the murdered men were not career soldiers but university professors, teachers, lawyers and other professionals on the military reserve list drafted into service in 1939. All were murdered by the NKVD in April and May 1940 by being shot individually through the back of the head, and most of their bodies were buried in mass graves in the forest near Katyn.

Andrzej Wajda's tour-de-force tells the story of the Katyn massacre (some of the victims were murdered at other sites but Katyn was the main location of this monstrous crime) and the subsequent personal and political consequences for the survivors and for Poland. The film is told through a dozen or so characters and is strongly scripted, superbly acted and gripping throughout. The version I saw had the original mainly Polish (but also with some German and Russian) dialogue and was subtitled in English. Shot predominantly in washed-out browns and greens the film has a real period feel and effectively evokes the 1940s when it is set.

The film opens in September 1939 on a bridge with a mass of civilians fleeing east away from the invading German armies meeting others fleeing west away from the invading Soviets. We are introduced to three of the main characters: Anna (the truly excellent Maja Ostaszewska) with her young daughter who has travelled with her across half the country from their home in Krakov to the east to find her husband, a Major in the Polish Army (played by the equally excellent Artur Zmijewski) now held prisoner with several thousand officers and NCOs by the invading Soviets. Loosely guarded at this early stage he passes over the chance to flee with his wife and child and chooses to stay with his colleagues from a sense of honour and his oath to the Army. This proves a fateful decision. The officers and NCOs are then removed to Soviet prison camps and Anna is stuck in the new Soviet zone away from her family in Krakov.

The narrative develops to juxtapose scenes involving different characters in different parts of Poland and how they cope with the new reality. A compassionate Red Army officer from the occupying force billeted with Anna and her daughter illustrates that the planned Soviet hegemony sees intellectuals as potentially sympathetic to democratic ideals and so dangerous elements to be eliminated.

In 1943 the bodies of those massacred at Katyn are uncovered by the Nazis who by then occupy the whole of Poland and half of Russia. The propaganda opportunities are enthusiastically seized on and film of the exhumed bodies is shown to paint the Soviets as ruthless murdering Bolsheviks and the heroic German soldier as noble crusader against Communist-Jewish tyranny. This factual episode from history is used as a turning point in the film for most of the characters.

Nothing is black-and-white: some of the characters are pragmatic (cynical? Self-serving?), some stand up for the truth as they know it and put themselves on the line (foolish? Futile heroics?) The film is even-handed: people face difficult choices according to circumstance and are not judged, but understood.

Wajda saves the real killer scene for the final reel, and the screen then goes dark with only sombre music.

Due to the international political situation, the cold war and the passage of time, no-one was ever brought to book for the crime. The perpetrators, and those who gave the order, were long dead by the time the truth emerged.

Despite the grim and serious subject matter I would recommend `Katyn' unreservedly. It really is a superbly crafted film.",1269734400,5,4187,4.945945945945946

3369515,5,B0014V8IIK,"I watched ""Katyn"" on a home computer screen. Even in that limited format, ""Katyn"" had an impact on me comparable to such cinematic greats as ""Lawrence of Arabia."" I cried throughout most of the film. I resolved that many of my relationships would be different. I remembered people I had known who reminded me of characters in the movie. After the film ended, I felt that I could not listen to the radio or read the newspaper or listen to anyone speak. I just needed to allow the film to sink into me.

Naysayers have critiqued ""Katyn"" as boring and dull. If you need a film to depict war, occupation, and atrocity as shiny, compact, and compelling as a sports car, then you should listen to those naysayers; don't watch ""Katyn,"" rather, watch the very silly, teen fanboy-friendly Quentin Tarantino flic, ""Inglorious Bastards."" If you've seen enough Hollywood productions jam-packed with sexy Nazis and happy endings, and you want to take in a film that dares to depict, in eyeblinks, what war, atrocity, and occupation looked like and felt like to real people, then by all means see ""Katyn."" One of the many features that I admired: ""Katyn""'s Nazis are not sexy. They are not Tom Cruise, Liam Neeson, Christoph Waltz. ""Katyn""'s Nazis are brutal, repugnant thugs.

I respect this movie. There are too few movies about which I'd say that. It shows the courage not to attempt to weave an uplifting, feel-good atrocity narrative that leaves the viewer with a smile. This isn't ""Schindler's List."" ""Schindler's List"" is a very good movie, but this isn't that. It is, rather, very much like what World War Two and the subsequent Soviet occupation sounded like to me when I listened to my own older friends and relatives, who lived through both. This is disjointed narrative, stories that seem headed for redemption or even ecstasy but that end in random death, that end in aborted normalcy, aborted joy, aborted meaning. I felt, in watching these cold, pale, stoic characters, as if I were, once again, sitting across the table from older Eastern European friends and relatives. Yes, that's what they looked like. Yes, those are the facial expressions they assumed when they talked about the uncle who was rounded up and never heard from again, the daring, handsome lad who ended up in a mass grave - or when they pointedly did *not* talk about these people. The gravestone whose inscription dares to tell the truth; the tearing down of a propaganda poster; the Red Army soldier who struggles to do the right thing by a widow, who won't yet admit that she is a widow; the singing of exactly the right Christmas carol at exactly the right moment: those are exactly the heroic gestures that no one ever saw, that went unrecorded, that only one person lived to tell about, to tell me. Here they are, onscreen.

When a movie is named ""Katyn"" the viewer knows how it will end; it's kind of like a movie named ""Auschwitz"" or ""Kolyma"" or ""Wounded Knee."" There isn't going to be a surprise ending. I was still surprised by the ending, by how courageous and moving I found it. Once again, Andrzej Wajda managed to wow the filmgoer in me. And he managed to move the human in me.

3369516,4,B0014V8IIK,"The strongest and most unforgettable part of Andrzej Wajda' Oscar nominated film is its final chapter, in which you will witness what happened in the Katyn forest in 1940. Be prepared for one long, graphic scene that depicts most cruel and brutal atrocities committed there. That everything was done in such a methodical way makes the already shocking subject matter more horrifying.

But ""Katyn"" (directed by Wajda who lost his father at Katyn) is also about those who are left behind, especially women: wives and mothers of the officers who disappeared into the forest forever. They do not merely have to wait in fearful anticipation; they also have to fight their own fight, even after the war is over, in the society where the authorities cover up the truths about Katyn.

There are a few too many characters in the complex story, and some sub-plots look unnecessary to me, but those who are more versed in the Polish history might feel otherwise. Most actors did a great job and among them two are standout - Maja Ostaszewska as Anna who believes her missing husband Andrzej is alive, and Andrzej Chyra as Lt. Jerzy who plays an important role when Anna finally knows about the truth about Andrzei and other officers.

My only complaint is that the film is too short. Wajda attempts to encompass so many episodes (well-told and emotionally intense as they are) in a two-hour film, and he even weaves real footage into his fictional drama part. You need more time to fully describe the far reaching tragedy and those who have been deeply affected by it.

3369519,4,B0014V8IIK,"A powerful depiction of the ordeal of Poland during and immediately after WWII.  The focal point is the massacre of Polish POWs by the Soviets in the Katyn forest in 1940.  Wajda and collaborators use the Katyn massacre and characters connected to the massacre to portray the tragedy that befell Poland.  The brutal occupation of what was then eastern Poland by the Soviets, the Nazi liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia, and the Soviet imposition of a Communist state after the war are shown in a series of direct, unsentimental, and powerful scenes.  The central armature of the film is the story of the Polish POWs slaughtered at Katyn, shown through the experience of a single fictional Polish officer. The majority of those killed at Katyn, and this group reputedly included Wajda's father, were reserve officers of middle class  origin who were perceived as enemies of a communist state.  This episode encapsulates the destruction of pre-war Poland that occurred during WWII.

The quality of acting, cinematography, plotting, and even music (featuring work of the great Polish composer Penderecki) is excellent.  Events are presented in a quotidian but cumulatively powerful manner.  The film artfully shows the convergence of many features of Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism.  The great convergence of Catholic faith and Polish nationalism is also shown.  The Polish experience of WWII was the subject of Wajda's early, famous films of the 50s, and there are some references within Katyn to the earlier films.",1261267200,10,1520,5.239669421487603

3369523,5,B0014V8IIK,"Katyn is one place that most Polish people will immediately recognize.  For us in the west, it is a little known World War 2 massacre that oddly enough was perpetrated and executed by Russia.

As far as WW2 massacres go, this is a drop in the bucket when compared to the 5 million Poles killed by Germany and another million Poles killed by Russia during WW2.  What is interesting about this incident is how both the Germans and the Russians used it in their war propaganda.  Add to that the 45 year cold war occupation where the Russians suppressed Polish history, and where the Poles really knew who killed who, and now you have an incident that becomes part of the Polish psyche.

What I liked about this movie is how it flows in time with visits to the past to clear up matters.  This is a nice touch by the master Polish director, Andrzej Wajda, who weaves the tale through the people most affected by the massacre, the victims and their families.

While this movie spans many years, you stay in touch with the families.  Children grow up, mothers get gray hair, and still the story continues.  At this point, many movies would loose focus, but not Katyn.  Wajda keeps tight control over the action and how much knowledge is known.  Like the families, you are kept in the dark about certain things.

Wajda does not overly indulge in sentimentality.  This is not a ""boo-hoo, where's daddy"" type of movie.  This movie is about a country and its people caught up in the giant war and occupation machinery of both Germany and Russia.  This is not an enviable place to be.  Also, Wajda does not use cheap action tricks like big bangs to keep the action and tension going.  This is primarily a historical drama, but when you get caught in the massacre, you'll be riveted, and you'll start praying, too.",1256169600,4,1801,4.543478260869565

3369525,5,B0014V8IIK,"This is a haunting film that has stuck with me for weeks since I first saw it; the kind of film that poses important questions without sacrificing the kind of narrative intensity the subject -- the murder of thousands of Polish officers held prisoner of war by the Soviet Union in the early years of World War II -- demands.

From the opening shot, when a group of refugees fleeing the invading Germans encounters another group coming from the opposite direction and fleeing from the Soviet Union -- which has taken advantage of the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviets to move in and occupy the eastern half of the country -- the stage has been set for the conflict. In the middle are the hapless Poles, with nowhere to turn; their only allies hundreds of miles away in France and England, showing no sign of running to help them. In Krakow, one character, a university professor, is deported to a concentration camp by the Germans; his son, an Army officer, is imprisoned by the Soviets. What is there to choose between them?

The story revolves around the choices made by the characters -- to live or to die, to accept historical distortions in the name of surviving and moving forward with their lives or to deny those in the face of horrific consequences. The film deals with a number of characters -- the wife of a general, the wife of the major, their daughters, their extended family, the two sisters of an engineer turned aircraft designer -- and their lives before, during and after the war, as well as that of one who miraculously escaped the carnage of Katyn forest, but becomes a victim of a different kind.

Initially, some aspects of the film struck me as slightly propagandistic, not so much in the sense of being anti-Soviet (although that is definitely a major theme) but in the sense of Polish nationalist. Still, I was quickly caught up in the story, thanks to the director's wisdom in noting that it is systems and people who adhere to those systems in a rigid way who are to blame, rather than individuals. While both the Soviets and the Nazis are displayed as despicable, it is a Soviet officer who performs a remarkable service for one of the army officer's wives early on in the story.

What is truth, and to what extent will people insist on their right to the truth when the price to be paid is nearly total -- freedom, peace of mind, friendship, etc.? Do we owe a greater loyalty to those who are dead, or to ourselves when they are gone and we can no longer do anything for them? Few films have the guts to tackle such complex issues and to do so in an honest fashion. Some of the answers -- as portrayed in the film, at least -- may be idealistic and even a bit unlikely, but such is the grip of the film that this didn't even occur to me until days later, and even then didn't cause me to question my impression of the film.

We know a lot about the Holocaust, thanks to films such as Schindler's List. This film may be the start of a wider-ranging debate about other kinds of war crimes, which, although they don't measure up to the horrors of the Nazi-designed genocide, should not be forgotten. This is definitely a polemical film, with a strong anti-Soviet/anti-Russian message, but it hews very close to what I know of the history of the period, and the wartime and postwar experience of Poland explains much about the current political state of Central Europe.

This is a startling and remarkable film that I'd recommend strongly to anyone with an interest in the period or a taste for cinema (vs Hollywood blockbusters). This isn't a star vehicle; it's an ensemble cast of actors who will be unfamiliar to most in North America, and the story skips quickly from one narrative to the next. It repays the effort. (Some of the subtitles were a bit erratic... but still comprehensible.) The final scenes are among the most chilling I have ever witnessed in my life.",1255305600,8,3919,4.559659090909091

Our first viewing of it(it will require some others before we can thoroughly understand the vision of the director) conveys the unpleasant impression of complete confusion and want of clarity. The habit of Mr wajda to shift all the time from a period or a group of characters to an other, added to the fact that the subtitles follow one another so rapidly, is extemely confusing. The impression of authenticity and horror, in my views, would have been better conveyed had the film been shot in black and white.",1254960000,2,681,4.779661016949152
3369527,4,B0014V8IIK,"...there's always the horrible tiny blooper that ruins the whole show for me: right after the lovely Ewa rescues the young Tadeusz from the cops, he makes a needless comment about Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty""; a movie that came out in 1959. Unfortunately, this scene takes place in ...1946. Where was Wajda's script girl, for gods sake?

And actually no; it's not a minor flaw. Since most of the plot revolves around what a difference a date makes, this stupid little gaffe self-mockingly sabotages the movie's entire case: ""1940, 1941, Nazis, Soviets ...so what? Who cares? Not even the filmmaker! See?""

Aside from that this film is a must, and I concur with the reviewer who says it's the kind of movie Hollywood would never make. Compare it with the false platitudes of, say, ""The Good German"" and you'll see how far Tinseltown is willing to lie rather than be branded ""politically incorrect"" by some showbiz sage still in mourning for the Rosenbergs. At the end of the day -and opprobrious as it was- McCarthysm was no equal to Communism by any standard. At its worst, few people lost their jobs during the former while millions were murdered by the latter. Among them, Andrzej Wajda's father. In Katyn. By the Soviets. Allies of the Nazis. Because they were -and are- one and the same thing.

3369528,5,B0014V8IIK,"A stunning production that portrays the systematic and ruthless Katyn Forest (In Poland) murder by the Soviet NKVD of over 20,000 Polish army officers, many of whom were army reservists.  Called to do their patriotic duty, they represented the core of the Polish professional elite, from professors to doctors and lawyers and businessmen and were thus a core potential threat to the suzerainty of Soviet power in the newly conquered territory.  On Stalin's orders, they were bussed into the forest, each shot in the back of the head and dumped in a mass grave.  The movie is particularly effective in the way it carries representative families along as the tragedy unfolds, woven into the fabric of the portrayal of a small but sophisticated nation overwhelmed by the brute power of the Nazis on one hand and the Soviets on the other, each cynically aligned with the other for plunder and territorial rape. Soviet propaganda for years worked hard to blame the atrocity on the Nazis--sustained for a long time by ""fellow travelers"" world wide--but the truth came out.

3369531,5,B0014V8IIK,"World War II stories seem to never end, but ""Katyn"" is a new and extremely important part of world history.  Directed by Oscar winning director Andrzeg Wajda, this two-hour masterpiece is a witness to courage and tragedy at their extremes.

In 1939, Poland occupants are surrounded by the Germans to the west and the Russians to the east.  This is an inescapable situation for the Poles.  There are several families situations that are weaved throughout this film with wife's and daughters searching for their Polish officer husbands, brothers, relatives and friends.  This sets the tone of the film, and personalizes it.  First a wife and daughter find their Polish officer husband as they flee the Germans, only to see him disappear.  A University is visited and the professors are asked to meet with the Russians; a fatal mistake but unavoidable.  Officers and intellectuals are held at various camps, waiting to be executed.

In 1940, the Russians murder most of the Polish officers, while letters, rumors and messages are spread from camps to families and back.  It is painful to watch.  The Germans exploit Russia's murderous rampage to gain allies.  Meanwhile, Polish residents are forced to sign allegiance to Russia, but there is a resistance, which is eventually fatal for most.  Director Andrzej Wajda weaves real footage of the discovery of mass graves to the Polish people (actors) in town squares.  (The films are authentic and Wajda splices them perfectly from black and white into the color film).  These films are the most horrific one will see, even in documentaries.  Polish officers are shown being systematically executed in the most egregious style.  This is interweaved with families contemplating what happened or actually finding out the demise of their husbands and sons.  It is heartbreaking.

The ending with the actually reenactment of the Polish armies being executed in mass graves while bulldozers  bury the evidence is startling and upsetting.  The final scene with a hand holding a rosary is devastating.  The film is one of the most factual (although the family dynamics are fictional) that one can witness.  Its the kind of film that you understand, can relate to and pulls you in every direction.  You know this happened 70 years ago, but the reality is palpable and upsetting.  There are no light moments - this is the real world.  It is a tribute to the people of Poland and their bravery.

This film is for fans of history and the truth.  To date, approximately 22,000 Poles have been found in mass graves in the ""Katyn"" forest and these mass grave discoveries are continuing to be found.",1253491200,9,2628,4.979310344827586

This is an historical piece well deserving of an addition to anyone's DVD library.  Highly recommended.",1253318400,5,388,4.746268656716418
3369533,4,B0014V8IIK,"I read about the mass killing at Katyn Forest years ago.  I had read what I could about the Holocaust more out of disbelief than curiosity.  When I came across the account of Katyn, I was surprised to discover another player in the category of World War II inhumanity.  The Soviet Russians were responsible for the Katyn mass murder of 12000 Polish officers.  They committed this heinous crime presumably because they wanted to eliminate the leaders of the country they had recently invaded; fewer leaders, fewer problems.  What made the whole tragic episode even more bizarre was the Third Reich's publicizing the massacre when they came across the scene in their invasion of Russia.

What I anticipated out the movie ""Katyn"" was an account of the tragedy with fictional characters to bring to life (and death) the humanity and inhumanity.  What I got from ""Katyn"" was all that plus an appreciation for the Polish perspective of a national tragedy that was compounded by having to live for decades under the iron rule of the perpetrators.  Director Andrzej Wajda has done a superb job of bringing out the emotions of the Poles.  I knew of the horror but I learned of the sorrow and anger.",1252886400,5,1189,4.78921568627451
3369534,5,B0014V8IIK,"After receiving this movie from a close friend, I sat down to one of the most spell-binding films I have ever viewed. I was just numb after watching such an atrocity, and was left with a thousand unanswered questions. I researched this event on the internet to find more answers and was shocked by the facts surrounding the Katyn massacre. For example - how does one Russian alone murder more than 6,000 men by shooting them point-blank in the back of the head... and live with himself? I watched every minute of the extras included on the DVD (all included English subtitles) and felt as though I could not learn enough of this horrible atrocity and the cover-up that lasted almost 50 years. It wassn't until 1989 when Mikhail Gorbachev, then President of the U.S.S.R., finally released documentation substantiating Stalin himself gave the order to carry out this massacre. My heart-felt thanks and appreciation is extended to all those involved in bringing this story to the big screen, and my sympathy is extended to the survivors of those murdered. This film is available through your local library, as well as Amazon.com. It is certainly a must-see and I cannot recommend it more highly.",1252281600,4,1192,4.876847290640394
3369535,3,B0014V8IIK,"The movie was good but disappointing.

The start was good as it showed Poland invaded and defeated on both sides - NS Germany on the West, Soviets on the East.

That part was good and I felt I was in time, seeing a rough time from the Polish perspective.

But then it all gets hazy - there is no clear time line of German driving back Soviets and occupying all of Poland, there is no feel for what it was like for Poles on German occupation except one scene where an SS officer insults the Polish academics.

My take on history was that many or even most Poles thought Soviets were more brutal, their occupation worse than Germans - who shared anti Bolshevik, Christian Europe sympathies.

But Poland was also close enough to Western Democracies, had good contacts in England US to have some realistic hope of being independent of both NS German occupation and Communists.

Anyway, that's history.

Another decent part is towards the end when Poland is under Soviet control after the war and Poles have to either accept the situation, make compromises to live get jobs or suffer extreme persecution.

One of the main compromises is that Poles must not say, write or think anything negative about the Soviet's actions against Poland in World War II, the worst being the mass murder of captured Polish officers at Katyn.

I am not sure the brutal murders of Polish officers by Soviets in Katyn should have been done at the end - but maybe it has the most effect.

But, the movie is still well worth watching - true history about Eastern Europe during and after WWII will not be found in Hollywood movies. All we get is the Germans are all evil - the 6 Million etc.",1251676800,2,1662,4.528428093645485
3369536,5,B0014V8IIK,"It takes a brave film-maker to direct such a controversial topic.  At last, one would hope, this heinous massacre has been laid bare.  Movies don't get any better than this!",1251590400,,173,4.733333333333333
3369537,4,B0014V8IIK,"During World War II, the citizens of Poland found themselves caught in a squeeze play of epic proportions - between the Nazis in the west and the Stalinists in the east, with each of the two superpowers intent on subsuming the defeated nation into its own sphere of influence.  Both invaders posed a serious threat to the innocent civilians who lived there and none more so than the wives and family members of officers serving in the Polish army.

""Katyn,"" the Oscar-nominated film by Andrej Wajda, tells of two such women, Anna (Maja Ostaszewska) and Roza (Danuta Stenka), whose husbands (Artur Zmijewski, Andrzej Chyra) are taken prisoner by the Russian army in late 1939.  Then, in the spring of 1940, in the depths of the Katyn Forest in western Russia, the Soviet guards turned their guns on their captives, shooting down thousands of unarmed men one by one, then burying their bodies in a shallow mass grave.  For years, the Nazis used the massacre as a propaganda tool against the Soviets, but with the defeat of the Nazis and the eventual Communist takeover of Poland, it became the Soviets' turn to exploit the tragedy by declaring the Nazis responsible for the atrocity, even going so far as to move the date of the event to late 1941.  It wasn`t until the eventual overthrow of the Soviets in Poland in the late 1980s that the long-buried truth could finally be revealed.

""Katyn"" is an understated, deeply humanistic and superbly acted look at an event that has haunted the Poles for generations.  Veteran director Wajda doesn't go in for grand gestures or cheap sentiment to relate a tale that he knows will open up a gaping moral wound in the psyche of his intended audience.  Instead, the characters in this movie confront the horrors of their lives with an almost matter-of-fact calmness and acceptance, the result, no doubt, of having already experienced death and suffering on an almost daily basis for years up to that point.  All the characters in this film are to some extent victims of their circumstances and of the cruel vagaries of fate, yet even within the proscribed limits of their situations, many still choose to act on their convictions and to try to determine, as much as possible, the course of their own lives and the future of their nation.

The screenplay could use a little more streamlining and clarity at times; certain characters pop up seemingly out of nowhere only to fade into the background never to be heard from again.  Yet, despite the somewhat muddled nature of the narrative, the movie shows just how far people are willing to go in denying reality, especially when their reasons for doing so involve fear of governmental retaliation, guilt for having stood by and allowing the atrocity to happen in the first place, patriotic fervor for the homeland, or the desire to simply abandon the past and get on with one's life.  Yet, the movie shows us that in all places and times, and no matter how great the threat or dire the circumstances, there will always be brave people willing to put their lives on the line for truth and justice.

This is a subtle movie that, in its own subdued, quiet way, will worm its way into the very center of your soul.  And it ends with a horrifying and profoundly moving scene that will leave any viewer with a heart and a conscience staring at the screen in stunned silence.",1251590400,7,3355,4.712820512820513
3369538,5,B0014V8IIK,"From the first frame till the poignant last scene, this is a movie I shall not soon forget. It is a compelling account of the Katyn massacre of 1940, where the Soviet NKVD, under Stalin's orders, murdered more than 20,000 Polish officers, educators, and various intellectuals. The movie is a cinematic triumph, masterfully directed by Andrej Wajda, whose own father was a victim of the massacre.

The movie itself plays out in three parts - the first focuses on the events in the early days of the war in 1939. Polish citizens are portrayed fleeing from the Germans on one side and the Russians on the other, meeting somewhere in the middle and not knowing where to go, as either way spells danger and doom. In the fracas, there is a mother and her young daughter who are looking for the husband and father, a cavalry captain in the Polish army. When they eventually find him, he refuses to leave with them, citing his loyalty to his fellow officers and the army. Time passes, and these Polish officers find themselves incarcerated by the Russians, awaiting an unknown fate. Later, the Germans reveal the horrors of Katyn, blaming the Russians and using it as propaganda in favor of their war efforts. The second part of the movie is about what happens after the war - Poland is under a new government, loyal to the Soviets [more of a puppet government] and Katyn is blamed on the Germans, though witnesses, family members of the murdered and those who do not buy into the new establishment know differently - the truth of Katyn, i.e. that the murders were committed by the Soviets. Yet, those who oppose find themselves in grave peril, as one notable character in the movie says ""I choose to be with the murdered, and not the murderers."" A choice that carries a high price indeed.

The final part is the most tragic as it follows the doomed on their journey towards death and the murder pits which are to be their graves. These scenes are harrowing to say the least, and the director does an excellent job in capturing the bewilderment,incredulity, and dawning horror on the faces of the condemned men. This is one of the most compelling WW II movies I've ever seen, which is saying a lot since I have watched many, especially those dealing with the Holocaust. It has been a long time coming, since not many movies have been made about this horrifying and tragic incident in history and I believe Andrej Wajda's ""Katyn"" is destined to become a classic.",1251158400,12,2453,4.649769585253456
3369539,5,B0014V8IIK,"My great uncle is identified as body number 758 of those dug up from the pits at Katyn Forest and identified. I therefore could relate strongly to this powerful movie. There were few happy endings for Poles during and after World War II, and unlike Hollywood movies, this film shows the stark reality of the situation for Poles caught between the brutality of the Germans and the Soviets. Both my great uncle and grandfather were officers (doctors) with the army reserve who were mobilized in August 1939. Both were rounded up with their units by the Soviets and separated from other ranks. My grandfather managed to escape when they were first rounded up and before the rest were transported elsewhere, but like the officer in the movie, my great uncle decided to stay with the other officers. No one ever saw him again. When the pits were dug up, we believe the Germans sent for his wife and youngest daughter to help in the idenfication. They were never seen again either. This movie is faithful to the history as we now know it and to the story as I heard it growing up in London surrounded by emigre Poles. It's time the rest of the world understood what went on in Poland during this dreadful time in its history.

Not long after his escape, my grandfather, along with my grandmother and father (at age 14), were rounded up and deported to Siberia as slave laborers (along with 1.5 million other Poles, roughly half of whom did not survive). My father has written a memoir of his experiences in the labor camp and his journey to freedom. The first edition of his book sold out in the U.K. and Poland, but the second edition will be available worldwide in February 2010, the 70th anniversary of the first deportation of Poles by the Soviets.

I must have seen several thousand movies in my life, but never has one left me shattered as Katyn did. (Full disclosure: years ago I knew a Polish family caught up in the events of September 1939, so I was ripe to be blown away by the opening minutes of the film, never mind the ending.)

If Katyn--the film and the massacre--has a moral, the moral is this: IT'S NOT OVER WHEN IT'S OVER. The shockwaves go on for years, decades, generations.

And perhaps this: the crime was not the murder of thousands of Polish officers and sergeants by the Russians, who wanted to clear the way for their takeover of Poland. The crime was what the Soviet Union did to Poland the half-century from 1939 to 1989. Blue skies! -- Dan Ford",1250899200,7,790,4.324324324324325

I called it disturbing and it really is along the lines of ""Schindler's"" List.  It is also a poignant historical lesson that is as important today as it was when these events occurred.

Without giving away any of the details, the movie follows a number of people who help bring the story and the history to life.  The story is well constructed although it was a little difficult for me to keep the storylines absolutely clear, particularly in the middle of the movie.  But don't despair, the final third of the movie is very well done and yes, I was moved to tears and horrified while deeply appreciative to be an American with the freedoms we enjoy.

The cinematography is very well done, the historical accuracy appears very good (I am not an expert on the era), and the acting is solid -- the story itself, terrifyingly beautiful.  I'd recommend this film to those who appreciate great movies.  I for one will add this to a select group of movies I will watch with my children as they get older to help illustrate why I love history, why history is important and in the starkest terms, why we are so blessed to be in a free country without fear of repression and retaliation.",1250812800,6,1303,4.468354430379747

3369544,4,B0014V8IIK,"KATYN is an heart-wrenching revelation of a little known Soviet Army atrocity that obliterated much of WWII Poland's middle & upper class male population.  By watching the nearly 50-minute Special Feature interview with director Andrzej Wajda it stunned me to discover that the film is portraying for the first time to Polish and international audiences a shocking story of the long-covered up execution-style murders of 20,000 Army officers, priests, policemen, business owners, alleged spies, and others who made up the intellectual, military, industrial and religious sectors of Poland.

Wajda's masterful directorial touch presents the story of this sinister slaughter principally from the point of view of 2 wives and young daughters of Polish officers.  Anna (Maja Ostaszewska), is the wife of an Army cavalry captain who keeps a detailed diary of his imprisonment -- from his initial transport by train from Krakow until the day of his execution in a remote area known as Katyn.  The other wife is Roza, the wife of a Polish general who is sent by train to a Soviet detention camp with thousands of his own troops.

Wajda, whose own father was killed in the Katyn massacre, captures the angst and despondency of the women and daughters at the disappearance and complete secrecy regarding the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones (husbands & fathers).  Wajda, who was a young teen at the time of the evacuation, ruefully mentions to the Special Feature interviewer the emotional impact on him and his own mother regarding the displacement, absence and eventual death of his father.  Such personal grief as his mother's and his own seems to strongly have influenced the point of view that he decided to portray in the film.

The acting of the entire cast is powerful.  Of special note is Andrzej Chyra, a well-known Polish actor, who gives a nuanced performance as an Army lieutenant.  Chyra, as Lt. Jerzy Porucznik befriends the cavalry major (Artur Zmijewski) shortly before the 2 are separated.  One brief interaction between the 2 officers results in a distressing turn of affairs that leads to added turmoil for Anna and her daughter and eventually for Jerzy himself.

The story ends powerfully, as the truth of what occurred at Katyn comes to light, the details of which should be reserved for those who choose to watch this film.  The soundtrack adds to the dramatic moments of the story without overpowering or substituting music for what is to be seen and heard about the characters & situations presented onscreen.",1250380800,6,2538,5.057553956834532
3369545,5,B0014V8IIK,"I was stunned by the beauty and the awesome skill of this film.  I have not seen a film so perfectly directed, so beautifully acted and stunningly shot since ""Tin Drum"".  Literally, there is not one instance in this film that I would change.  It is literally - perfect.

On the movie disc, there is an interview with Polish director Wajda who explains that his own father was one of the Katyn victims.  Wajda relates how he then watched his own mother die of grief after the war when she finally realized that her husband was dead.  Wajda explained that this colored his interpretation of the movie whereby the bulk of those survivors who struggle to come to grips with the horror of the Katyn massacre are almost all women.  (Then again, who else was left behind to cope with it?)

This film is a masterpiece.  And believe me, I do not say that lightly.  I watch at least 3 films a week, sometimes as many as 5, so I am sadly aware of the dearth of decent films out there.  At least half (if not more) of the films I watch have me pushing the 'fast forward' button within the first 5 minutes of watching.  Not this film.  I sat riveted to my seat from the opening scene clear through to the unnerving end.  (Oh, the ending will tear your heart out.)

3369546,5,B0014V8IIK,"This was probably the biggest national heartbreak suffered by a single country other than the Holocaust.  It happened when Stalin ordered the NKVD to ""liquidate"" the captured Polish POW's who had the misfortune of being captured by Timoshenko's troops instead of Guderian's or Runstedt's. The ""4th Partition Of Poland"" created a problem for the western allies that would not resurface until 1942 when Stalin's government, who adamantly refused the recognized legitimate government-in-exile in London's request to send the Swiss and the Red Cross over to what the Germans discovered at Katyn.  The Soviets told the world it was a German Atrocity while the Nazis were telling the world that it was a Soviet Atrocity.  Only the Poles and Soviets knew the real truth and no Nazi forensics was going to tell anybody different. The Poles because it affected their families directly when they lost contact with their loved ones captured by the Red Army. The Soviets because they knew exactly who gave the orders as well as who carried those orders out--afterward, many of them who committed the executions themselves would be slaughtered by their co-workers on orders of their superiors.  What few survivors there were from the executioners' side were either discredited because of their mental imbalances or they drunk themselves to their deaths.  It was the lies of Katyn that compelled Stalin to break relations with the London Government as well as work to crush the Polish Home Army that was loyal to it. The Home Army fought and died with the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto against the Germans while Rokossovsky's troops were ordered to stand back and let the Germans take out the last vestige of Pilsudski's and Paderewski's Pre-War Poland. Once it was clear that the Germans effectively eradicated all Polish military resistance, The Stavka gave the order with Stalin's blessing for Rokossovsky's forces to take Warsaw from the Germans and continue their drive to the west to take up as much land as possible before the Americans and the British take it.

Katyn was the fulcrum by which the Polish people would judge their experience under Communist rule, first under Soviet Occupation and then as a Soviet satellite, a forced ally despite centuries of mistrust between them.  The lies of Katyn that compelled Stalin to set up the Lublin Government in 1942 to counter the London Government and when Rokossovsky took Warsaw, the Lublin Government became the de-facto government of Poland--even though many in its government, including its Minister of Defense, Konstantin Ustinovich Rokossovsky himself, were not Poles.  Because of Katyn, many Poles after the war did not respect the Polish Government as their legitimate government, Let alone the PRP, the Polish Communist Party.

The Polish Governments of Wladislaw Gomulka, Stanislav Konya, Edvard Gierek, Konya again and Wojciech Jaruzelski had to walk a balancing act between the Polish people and the Soviets despite the fact that the rest of the world did recognize Gomulka's government as the official government of Poland in the mid-1940s.  It was fait accompli that made it happen, brought about by a Soviet victory which further tried to bury Katyn to the Poles and the rest of the world--even though the rest of the world knew the truth.  Churchill even wrote about it in his history of the Second World War.

It wasn't until Gorbachev became General Secretary in Moscow and his calls for openness after the Chernobyl disaster that forced a discussion about Katyn in both Poland and the Soviet Union.  The Poles also learned other truths about their leaders as well, especially Jaruzelski, who during that time was arrested by Smersh troops and and hauled off to a gulag in Siberia, only to be rehabilitated after the war and brought into the ranks of the new Polish Army and the PRP. By discussing the subject of Katyn, the Poles confirmed their beliefs in their common loss, which until this time was considered a loss suffered by specific families.  By this time, the Polish government found itself in an untenable position with their own people and without Gorbachev and his government to support them further. If it was the will of the people to undo their government by either coup or reform, the Red Army would not stand in the way. The only guarantee that Gorbachev would give to Poland was that their territorial integrity especially against Germany would be defended.

Jaruzelski had to give opposition parties more legitimacy and even had to allow for the possibility that the PRP could lose its monopoly on political power, especially when the government thus far failed to deliver prosperity to the people it served.  He also had to allow for the possibility that he may also be tried for crimes either for what he did in World War II or even afterward.  The government was between a rock and hard place.  Eventually, that government dissolved peacefully and the opposition parties gathered together with the PRP's successor party, the USDRP.  In the early-1990s, even Jaruzelski tried to paint himself as a reformer in the Gorbachev mold, but his past caught up to him, especially what he did in 1981 trying to squelch the Solidarity movement.

The lessons of Katyn are that no matter how deep one tries to bury the truth behind an atrocity, It will always be in the background and will determine how one perceives people who either built the lies or benefited from them. Katyn founded Post-War Poland twice--first in 1942 by its lies and then in 1990 by its truth.",1248998400,95,5535,4.982646420824295
3369547,5,B0014V8IIK,"Andrzej Wajda's masterpiece, KATYN, is now finally widely available. It was once nominated for the Oscar, and is a very moving, educational, and thought-provoking film.

The movie begins with the German-Soviet conquest of Poland in 1939. The viewer senses the actions of the aggressors through the eyes of the civilians.

But this is only the beginning of Poland's sufferings. Both enemies of Poland begin their genocide of Poles with the best of Polish society. The Germans invite some professors to the university, only to promptly arrest them (for shooting, or slow deaths in concentration camps). The Soviets hold the captured officers and intellectuals at places such as Kozielsk, where the prisoners sing Christmas carols in December 1939. It will be their last Christmas. By spring 1940, the Soviets decide to shoot nearly all of the captive Polish officers.

The movie also shows the life of relatives of the Soviet-held men. First there are the letters, and hope for a speedy reunion. Then...silence. Finally, the Germans break the news of their discovery of the Katyn mass graves, and exploit it for propaganda purposes--hoping to divide the Allies. The relatives face the fact that their men will never return.

After the war, the suffering of the Katyn relatives continues. Information about the exact fate of the missing men is skimpy. The Soviet puppet state, using the Communist terror police (the UB), tries to force the grieving relatives to sign a statement blaming the Germans for the crime. The relatives also face pressure from others to ""accept reality"" that Poland will never again be free, and must align itself with Soviet dictates. They refuse. Then they have problems sending their son to the university because they won't bow to the Soviet lie about Katyn.

Polish movies tell it like it was, and often don't have a happy ending. WARNING: This movie has graphic scenes of the Polish officers being shot and blood being spilled. This may upset sensitive viewers. These scenes come near the end of the movie, as the victims are trucked to the sites of death, and, one-by-one, shot point-blank in the back of the head. The beginnings of the ""Our Father"" are the last words on their lips.

3369549,5,B0014V8IIK,"The 1940 Soviet massacre of over 20,000 Polish internees, including some 12,000 officers in Katyn forest, was, by any measure, a horrific war crime, yet one that has never been prosecuted, and one that has been shrouded and confused over the past half century by coverups, propaganda and a general desire to forget the past. (The Soviet government did not officially admit that the killings were ordered by Stalin until 1990.)

Wajda's masterful film centers on this dismal episode by revealing the webs of commitment and interaction that connect disparate lives - from an impetuous youth, to the staid wife of an executed general. Most all of the movie is an examination of these connections, of how lies and fabrications feed terror, of how in war there are seldom good choices between right and wrong. Only in the closing minutes, after all the victims have been deeply humanized, is the brutal, machine-like horror of the killings brought to center stage. The effect is powerful and profound.

The misty cinematography, in hues of brown and grey, evokes the mood and texture of wartime. Characters are richly drawn, and if at times the sudden introduction of new faces is confusing, it is only until one realizes Wajda's intent: these people could be any of us.

The real story in which is based the film is that the secret soviet police commited this genocide. The truth was known for years but it was supressed because of politics in Europe. This is just one of those horrible stories menkind was lied about. Someone once said the history is a bunch of lies and this is even more truth when its related to war. Allot of allies crimes where commited and germans crimes as well. But as the ones that loses the war they are blamed for everything. We never see horrible stories about 50 millions people butched by the soviets no are we going to see hollywood movies that is based on story instead of novelty. This is film has the same quality hollywood makes but is based on history. One of those lies most people don't know about and they will never do since this movies is almost unknown. The movie is high quality and I really recommend this movie. Its something different told from another perspective. I hope someday we see more films based on real history facts and not just thrillers that want to take consumers money. A history film should never be a novel or biased to one side only. It should try to tell a story about something that happened. Katyn does this well. Im glad amazon has this movie for sale again.

8256352,4,B0014V8IIK,"Andrzej Wajdas take on the Katyn massacre is a personal narrative: reducing the panorama of history to its impact on individual lives; personal in that its based on his own family, his fathers execution at Katyn and his mothers search for the whys and wherefores.  Those who state that this film doesnt do the story justice are demanding a panoramic epic that  in its totality  would reduce the event, not enhance it.  The political is always personal: it is lived and endured by real people.

The Koch Lorber DVD provides an interview with Wajda, which much also be seen not only to appreciate the film for a foreign viewer but to put it into Wajdas personal context.  The movie itself is beautifully shot, with exquisite detail on period authenticity.  The political finger-pointing is what one would expect: evil Germans, evil Soviets but  Wajda in the interview explains this is not enough.  It was the moral malaise of the prewar regime that set the stage for defeat, as much as conspiracy by outside forces.

For Wajda the Polish officers executed by the Soviets  and the intellectuals depicted at Jagiello University, disposed of by the Germans - are the true representatives of the ""free"" Polish nation decapitated by these external forces.  But here I think he also falls victim to the malaise he described in the interview.  Such elites were only a small fraction of the Polish people, which at this time was overwhelmingly peasant and working class, with low prospects for education or upward mobility.  This elites disconnect from the mass of those it ruled (and remember a third of prewar Polands people were not ethnic Poles) explains the said malaise; why the Polish regime was kicked over like a scarecrow from either side.  The maids wife who becomes first lady of the community is seen as a traitor, because she and her husband collaborate with the new regime that helped the Soviets cover up the massacre.  Yet one must ask the brutally honest question: what did these traditional officers or intellectuals truly mean to her?  Opportunities for her kind expanded precisely because old rulers were removed and openness made for persons who otherwise would have remained locked in prewar caste confines.  If the postwar society was not free, its prewar regime was certainly not democratic in any meaningful sense.

In the interview Wajda also gives a common misuse of genocide.  If Katyn were a true genocide, his mother would not have been left alive to pursue her husbands fate; nor would Wajda have been allowed to survive to film it: there is no Jewish film maker in Poland.  He also states that this is the last war film of its kind.  Perhaps only in the sense that it was made by someone who personally remembers the era; but he himself says that its subject would have been impossible before 1989.  Thus Katyn is an example of the new Polish cinema, that can raise these publicly unasked questions with their privately known answers.

One reviewer has pointed to the parallel propaganda war between Reich and Soviets, employing the same demonology in mutual accusations.  Of course the Germans revealed the details precisely to drive a hard wedge between the exile Polish-Soviet alliance, always brittle at the best of times (as this generation well remembered the Polish-Soviet war of 1920.)  This rift was instrumental in the Soviet reluctance to help the Home Army in its ill-advised Warsaw Uprising; both of which became major cold war points which the Soviets handled with ill grace and bad faith until 1990 - an unhealed wound unfortunate for any attempt to build a new postwar Europe.  Wajdas patriotism is muted, the opposite of the flag waving variety exploited now by Polands politicians.  In this his film may indeed be the last of its kind, as those who recall this period with pain and insight fade from the scene.",1473638400,,3851,4.874039938556067
