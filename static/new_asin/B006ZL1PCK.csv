5042694,4,B006ZL1PCK,"This collection contains some great spaghetti westerns in decent quality. I recommend watching any of these old westerns on a HD tv in a blu ray player that has DVD enhancement. If you watch them on the old fashioned tv they won't look as good. This collection has some great lost classics in them, as well as some more comedy orientated ones like Buddy Goes West, Blood Money, and Life is tough Providence. Yes these are old movies since this era was from the mid 60s all the way to the late 70s, but the entertainment factor is still there and holds up good. Great value for the money, and if you are fan of the genre I wouldn't hesitate to snatch this compilation pack up.",1401148800,3,675,4.365079365079365
5042695,5,B006ZL1PCK,"I am always surprised when I come across Spaghetti Westerns that I have never seen before.  I love these movies due to the action and the really fast gun fights.  My favorite is Sartana Saga and Django movies, which I have to finish collecting, I do not have cable I just enjoy all of my collected movies, which is nearing 2000.",1394150400,3,328,4.360655737704918

5042697,5,B006ZL1PCK,"The transfer quality on these films is much better than some I've seen.

Some of the big names in the genre is in this eight pack: Lee Van Cleef, Giuliano Gemma(three of them, Bud Spencer, Tomas Milian(two of them), and William Berger.

You have straight and comedy(one of which is not real good).

Still they are spaghetti westerns and I have a weakness for the,",1382140800,3,363,4.553846153846154
5042698,5,B006ZL1PCK,I wanted a starter collection of these kind of movies to let me sample them. I've watched about half and have enjoyed myself so far.,1379203200,,132,4.32
5042699,3,B006ZL1PCK,"So far I've only seen three of the films on here, Blood Money, The Bounty Killer, and Price of Power, but I'm not going to comment on the films themselves, only the quality. If you want info on the movies, go search them up at the Spaghetti Western Database. All of these have cropped sides, quality no better than a VHS, but if you're buying this I hope you don't expect them to be any better and just want to watch them for the films themselves.

Buddy Goes West: The print is faded, everything losing some color. The audio quality is pretty good, with some white noise in the background. 89 min, cut from the original 97 min.

Sartana in the Valley of Death: Uses a German print, pretty good quality, though details suffer some slight artifacting (signs, etc). Audio is muffled and low, but this can be corrected with a volume adjustment. 79 min, cut from the original 98 min.

Wanted: Print is a decent Italian one, artifacting affecting signs. The real gripe here is the audio quality. It seems to have a mosquito whine running over it that gives me a headache and for me makes it unwatchable. Otherwise it's slightly muffled. 100 min, cut from original 104.

Blood Money: French print, good quality, though slightly blurry. Audio a bit low and faded, but actually pretty good in comparison to the last two. 96 min, cut from original 103.

Sundance Cassidy and Butch the Kid: Italian print, good color, very watchable. Full screen, but with the same cropping I mentioned. Audio is quite low with some muffling. 97 min from original 101.

Life is Tough, Eh Providence?: This Italian print is as good as the last, a tad dark. Audio is pretty good as well, comparable to Blood Money. 96 min from 100.

Bounty Killer: Slightly artifacting Spanish print, faded dark, especially noticeable in dark or shadowy scenes. Audio is muffled close to distortion, when Milian's character speaks it's difficult to understand what he says half the time. 92 min from 96.

Price of Power: good Italian print, like Providence's. A bit shadowy, but nothing that harms the film, even in dark scenes. Also looks like this has a good wide screen presentation (though the cropping remains, evidenced by the opening credits). Audio has a hiss behind it, and sound effects are kind of muffled. 108 min from original 113.

Overall, this is a pretty decent enough budget release. Audio problems really bring it down,  though I would do 3 and a half stars if it would let me. For good info on other spaghetti western collections, check out the SWDB's cheap box sets guide!",1375747200,12,2547,4.677852348993288
5042700,5,B006ZL1PCK,"THIS IS A GREAT BARGAIN PRICED COLLECTION OF ITALIAN WESTERNS WORTH THE THE PRICE FOR BUDDY GOES WEST ALONE, BUD SPENCER IS GREAT AS USUAL IN THIS TOTAL COMEDY ,BLOOD MONEY ,WANTED AND THE BOUNTY KILLER ARE ALSO VERY GOOD.IN MY OPINION THE 3 STAR RATING TITLED WHERES THE TOMATO SAUCE? SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM HERE BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO POSTED IT DID NOT EVEN WATCH THE FILMS, TO ME THATS JUST AN UNFAIR BIASED OPINION THAT THIS COLLECTION DOES NOT DESERVE ,I HAVE PAID MORE FOR WORSE VIDEO AND BAD FILMS.",1375747200,4,505,4.5
5042701,3,B006ZL1PCK,"Three stars because I didn't watch the movies. Bought as a gift for western-starved friends who enjoy watching the bad guy bite it. They had no complaints about the quality of discs but they are not techies or critics.

If Lee Van Cleef ain't in it, it ain't worth watching.",1357171200,2,274,4.48
5042702,4,B006ZL1PCK,"I've enjoyed a certain number of spaghetti western movies so I was delighted to find this ""8 Spaghetti Westerns"" compilation DVD package in the five-dollar bin at a nearby Wal-Mart store. Some are kinda interesting movies, if you like western movies. I grew up on western movies, but that was back in the 40s and 50s and they were of a different type. In general, spaghetti westerns tend to have stark and barren settings located in dry and dusty environments. Most people wear rumpled and filthy clothes and look as if they probably smell bad. They drink and fight a lot and a lot of the fights are blazing gun battles. The bad guys are some really despicable hombres and there are a lot of them. The body count tends to be very high in these films and there's a lot of destruction of the fragile sets. The acting tends to be poor. I watch these things for the activity, not the acting. Oh yes, there tends to be grandiose background music and stark visual desert landscapes.

This packet of two DVDs seems to be of reasonable quality for a bunch of old movies, especially when four movies are on each DVD. I'd say the best movies are ""Blood Money,"" ""Buddy Goes West,"" ""Wanted,"" and ""The Bounty Killer."" I'd rate them individually about four stars and the others as three stars. I'd rate the entire package as four stars. I mean, where can you get eight movies for five bucks? You can buy most of the movies as DVDs or VHS tapes, but it'll cost you a lot more. This packet is a comparative bargain.
