8200486,3,B000005ZPQ,"For people who love Milton Berle or one of the performers featured on a show included in this series, you will love this set of videos. We are lucky to have them, in any condition.  The video portion is fine; but the audio has suffered from years of lying in storage: parts are fine, but other parts are scratchy, or have a ""wow"" sound behind them, and sometimes the sound drops out entirely, but only for a second.  Again, if you love the people included in this set, go ahead and order it.  Your enjoyment of the performer(s) you're interested in will keep you from noticing the audio deficits.",976579200,2,596,4.4495412844036695
