1641077,5,B00005OLXD,"One of the best things about the wiggles is that the songs aren't sickening sweet, like a purple dinosaur we all know. They are all very singable, with a lot of fun thrown in. The songs on this tape are all original. We start with Songs while the kids are waiting for Santa Claus to arrive. Of course Captain feathersword has short wave in his head and can tune to where Santa currently is. Santa arrives and they all dance together.
Guest appearances by an Irish Tenor singer (Morgan Crowley) who sings curoo curoo (carol of the Birds) while the children play in a nativity scene. That is the only song with strong religious overtones. There is also a guest appearance by Scottish and Irish Dancing children in their traditional custumes. I have a sneaking suspicion that Morgan also doubles as Santa, but I can't prove it.
The whole tape is very upbeat, and dancable. Jimmy the Elf is their first animated song, and its very cute. Captain Feathersword gets completely decorated in tinsel garlands, and also has a singing lesson with Morgan. He does well...only when Morgan is looking at him, that is! A really cute bit.
I love the Wiggles, my 2 and 4 year old kids love the wiggles, even my husband loves the wiggles!",1007424000,3,1219,4.5963302752293576
1641078,3,B00005OLXD,"We own all of the Wiggles videos and have even bought some from their Australian homeland!  We love their music and dances!  When we saw that this new Christmas video was coming out, I pre-ordered it right away!  It was so disappointing!  The songs were annoying and the children who have appeared in every video have been replaced!  Maybe if it is your first try at the Wiggles, you will be happy with this purchase, but Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas is the much better choice in our eyes!  But to be fair, our 2 year old loves it just as he does all of the others!",1007078400,,561,4.295238095238095
1641079,1,B00005OLXD,"My 2 yrs old  who is absolutely in love with wiggles, did not like this one at all. Some songs are so slow it puts us to sleep. It is just too boring. He would only watch it for maybe one song and turns it off.",1006992000,,210,3.5652173913043477
1641080,5,B00005OLXD,"We bought this video at the beginning of November, and my kids have watched it at least once every day since then. Their favorites are ""Jimmy the Elf"" and ""Doing the Christmas Dance"". This video is full of catchy tunes and my 2-year-old son loves to get up and dance to it. If I'm in another room, he comes running to tell me that ""Jimmy the Elf"" is coming on. This video will get any child (and adults) up and dancing. This is one video that we don't mind watching over and over.",1006732800,,480,4.172043010752688
1641081,3,B00005OLXD,"Okay, I was very excited to see this Wiggles Christmas tape but, my son was not into this tape.  As others have noted, the dancing is not like in previous Wiggles video.  It is much harder for a child to follow and perform.  The music is ok some classics in there.  I was a little disappointed in that it didn't follow the more child friendly format that the Wiggles are accustommed to.",1004832000,6,386,4.319444444444445
1641082,5,B00005OLXD,"This one is truly a new release, unlike some of their other ""new"" releases from 1995. In fact Yule Be Wiggling was released on the same date in Australia, so it is fresh out of the press. I own all The Wiggles videos, including their other Christmas one, and this one is exceptionally good! It includes a 3D graphic world as in Toot Toot and Wiggly Playtime. The songs are all very good, all new, and well choreographed. The dances are really fun and festive, perfect for Christmas time or anytime really. My only complaint is in their more professional polished look, they left out most of the familiar smaller children we have seen in all their other videos, in favor of older dancers. It would be nice to see those kids years later and growing up. My baby is 14-month's-old now and has adored anything by The Wiggles since she was 2-month's-old. She took to this new one right off the bat. Of all The Wiggles videos the other Christmas one and Wake-up Jeff are my babies favorites, now we add Yule Be Wiggling to the list. A terrific magical holiday experience for the entire family! Fun, cute, catchy songs, wonderful dancing, and a 3D modeled environment that is very eye chatchy to watch! They just keep getting better all the time.",1003708800,18,1238,4.556053811659193

Very good  movie and I enjoy it.
Little girls love this movie.
Thanks again so much.",1359849600,,107,4.35
1641103,4,B00005OLXD,This is a fun video of Christmas music and dancing for kids. We  will be using it at church for programs that include motions with the singing. Our kids really enjoyed it.,1359331200,,171,4.34375
1641104,4,B00005OLXD,"I bought this for my niece who is a fan of the wiggles,she is 17 months old and wiggles video catch her attention,I bought several DVDs and she like them all! Good buy!",1346630400,,168,4.121212121212121
1641105,4,B00005OLXD,"When comparing ""Yule Be Wiggling"" with ""Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas,"" the latter is, to our family at least, clearly a better video, if not the best Wiggles video of all. While ""Yule"" has many strong songs, the overall progression is uneven and songs often seem strung together randomly. The visual effects, particularly the backdrops and graphics, drench the screen with rainbowy colors that one does not associate with Christmas. (Were The Wiggles in their Sgt. Pepper phase??) One senses that touring considerations determined that the same loud color scheme be used as much as possible. The pre-teen children who danced so superbly in earlier Wiggles videos are largely missing in ""Yule Be Wiggling."" Their disappearance is unfortunate because in the past they enthralled little viewers who in turn tried to dance like them. Instead several young-adult professional dancers bounce around at a frenetic pace that kids can't follow. While those adult dancers are skilled and well-meaning, their preening for the camera becomes cloying. Dear Wiggles, your little fans prefer simplicity and familiarity. I thought of giving the video three stars but still give it four because it is better than most children's fare out there.",1231977600,2,1223,5.309278350515464
1641106,4,B00005OLXD,"My daughter is still watching this Christmas video in March!  She really enjoys it.  I thought the Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas video was a little better than this one, but it's still a great DVD.  Yule Be Wiggling has fewer traditional songs but as always, they keep writing catchy songs that i find myself singing.  My 4 year old loves The World Is One, Can't Wait for Christmas, and Jimmy the Elf.  Good choice for kids that enjoy the Wiggles.",1206576000,,442,4.544303797468355
1641107,5,B00005OLXD,This one is my favorite of the 3 Christmas DVDs the Wiggles have out!  It's very educational about Christmas around the world and what Christmas day is like.  My favorite part is when Morgan Crowley is teaching Capt. Feathersword to sing and the Capt. is singing Jingle Bells and is going back to his 'screaming' voice when Morgan isn't looking.  It's hilarious!  My daughter and step son both LOVE this movie!  I don't think they'll let me pack it back up with the Christmas stuff!,1135900800,6,482,4.623529411764705
1641108,5,B00005OLXD,"My kids love this so much. We bought it in the middle of summer to get our minds off the heat and they have watched it many times already. My two boys(1 and a half and 3 and a half) loved Wiggly Wiggly Christmas. But now love this so much more. They sing and dance and really enjoy it. True, some of the songs are very silly and not at all familiar but that is why we like it. It's a great addition to the other more traditional Christmas DVDs. Trust me- you will catch your kids singing these songs all by themselves!!",1125273600,5,519,4.048543689320389
1641109,3,B00005OLXD,"This wasn't as good as some of the other Wiggles videos, but my daughter still liked some of the songs.  The Santa looked ridiculous and there were too many special effects, which made it look busy.",1098748800,5,198,4.5
1641110,5,B00005OLXD,"As always, I love singing with Greg and the other Wiggles, even their own Christmas songs from (Yule Be Wiggling).
I love all of the songs which include ""Just Can't Wait For Christmas Day"", ""Here Come The Reindeer"", ""The World Is One On A Christmas Morning"", ""Murray's Christmas Samba"" and ""Yule Be Wiggling"".
Greg is the lead vocalist and Yellow Wiggle.",1082851200,,354,4.819672131147541
1641111,5,B00005OLXD,"From the moment that the DVD started with ""Doing a Dance"" we fell in love with it.  This is my favourite Christmas Wiggly DVD.  I thought that it was neat how Greg, Anthony, Murray, and Jeff sang about Christmas in Australia and how much different it is there for them at Christmas, than it is here for us (we're burried in snow).  The first time that my son saw the video for ""And the World is One on a Christmas Morning"" he asked me if we could go swimming Christmas day like the kids in the video, and I had to tell him that we couldn't, it would be more like going ice skating.  After I explained that it was very warm in Australia at Christmas, and that it isn't here, he understood, and then asked if we could go to Australia to go swimming with the Wiggles.
The rest of the DVD is packed with energizing music that keeps my son and I Wiggling for hours.  This is a must buy, if you like Christmas, and love the Wiggles. It will keep you Wiggling.",1071964800,4,953,4.129729729729729
1641122,5,B00005OLXD,We've been watching the Wiggles for years and own every video available in the U.S.  Yule be Wiggling is a terrific way to get into the Christmas spirit and is a good mix of songs you know and some of their own.  It's a great addition to your Wiggles collection.  WE LOVE IT.,1068163200,,275,4.150943396226415
1641123,5,B00005OLXD,"We have been Wiggle's fans since we first saw them appear on Playhouse Disney.  My son was then 16 months and when the Disney Channel played ""Yule Be Wiggling"" during their Christmas season, my son was enthralled.  Even my then 4 month old daughter loved them.  We have a large collection of Wiggles videos and DVD's now - but this one is requested more than any other.  My now 9 month old daughter laughs when its on, and my 29 month old son sings and dances to all the songs.  It is almost June now and my son wants to watch it at least once a week still.  This Wiggle's tape offers Christmas spirit all year, and who would ever think that's a bad thing?",1053734400,4,656,4.208
1641124,5,B00005OLXD,"We found the VHS version at the local library and checked it out for our 20 month old son to watch.  We watched it every day for a week.  His 6 year old brother really enjoyed it too, with ""Jimmy the Elf"" and ""Caroo Caroo"" being his favorite songs.  I also enjoyed ""Caroo Caroo"" which features the Irish tenor from ""Riverdance"", Morgan Crowley. I knew this was a keeper so we bought the DVD version which also has karaoke style sing-a-longs for all the songs, or you can turn on subtitles which has the same effect throughout the whole video.
This has become one of our most repeatedly viewed DVDs.",1052524800,8,598,4.418181818181818
1641125,5,B00005OLXD,"Seeking some variety in my 22-month-old daughter's Wiggles repertoire, I recently pulled this tape out of the closet even though it's the beginning of Spring.  I'm glad I did, because I'd forgotten how good it is.
Like the best Wiggles videos, of which this is one, the strength of the songs and their delivery is consistent throughout.  There's enough variety to keep things interesting--such as the inclusion of the animated ""Jimmy the Elf""--but it manages to capture a mood at the same time.  A slightly glitzy, wacky, commercialized mood, yes, but this is The Wiggles we're talking about after all.
Having a large collection of Wiggles videos in our home, I judge them from an adult standpoint on the ""Does it stick in my head afterwards"" measure.  And this collection passes the test with flying colors.  Hours after it ends, I find myself humming such songs as ""Just Can't Wait For Christmas Day,"" ""Doing A Dance,"" and most notably, ""Decorate the Tree,"" which stands right up there with ""Captain's Magic Buttons"" in terms of goofy Captain Feathersword fun.
There are somber moments in the tape, too, giving the tape a good mix of Christmas fun and spirit.  If your home is like mine, you'll welcome this tape as one of the enjoyable parts of the season--regardless of what season it is.  In heavy rotation at the moment, I'm not even sure at this point if my daughter will let me put it away before Christmastime.  And I really wouldn't mind if she didn't.",1050624000,,1462,4.75098814229249
1641126,5,B00005OLXD,"All the Wiggles Videos/DVDs out there are great.  I've been watching them since 1995 with my first child.  I know all the songs... pretty scary.  These guys are goofy but my kids love them.  Can't go wrong with any of their videos/dvds.

1641127,5,B00005OLXD,"My grandson's version of this was under the tree at Christmas time and put the other presents to shame. Well, maybe everything but the electric train but he loves the Wiggles.
Buy Every Wiggles movie you can. It will keep your children and grandchildren for hours and after about two days, you will be singing the songs as well.
They are not just the hottest children's group in Austrilia, they are the hottest signing group period.  It is for good reason as they seem like a nicer, smarter version of the Monkees.
My grandson and I dance with Wags the Dog on a frequent basis.

1641128,2,B00005OLXD,"My 22 month old absolutely adores the Wiggles, and is mesmerized by most of their shows...except this one...there is a lot of singing and dancing, but it moves at a much slower pace than some of their others.  For my toddler, it's the colorful, fast-paced, upbeat shows that he prefers, not the ones showing them sitting around a Christmas tree singing mellow songs, with the children swaying their heads to the beat. Also, my son is not impressed with children in costumes dancing on stage....he only wants to see THE WIGGLES dancing around and singing!! While I really do appreciate the multicultural, and especially the CHRISTIAN emphasis of this show, he does not!",1043107200,,668,4.911504424778761
1641129,5,B00005OLXD,We loved this.  My son loved the music and dancing as well as singing along with murray.  I found the music very energetic and fun to listen to.

The Irish singer they bring in has a wonderful voice and personally would love to see him included with guest appearances in their future works.  Our whole family dances and sings with the Wiggles.  It is great exercise for the kids and us grown-ups as well and is fun to do.  It is amazing how much the kids learn from watching these videos.
