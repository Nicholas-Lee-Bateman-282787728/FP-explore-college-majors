8280874,5,B001B0XA7I,I stumbled on this series while looking for Land Rover items.  I bought it because it follows the Land Rover Longitude Expedition but it was like setting off on an unimaginable adventure and being right there with the team.  You get to know them well.  They go through training with Land Rover and then set off around the world.  The adventures are absolutely awesome.  A must watch for any adventure-minded driver or traveler..,1480204800,,428,4.808219178082192
8280875,1,B001B0XA7I,Spoiled brats pretending like they know how to drive off road. I really can't add anymore than that. Any person that's done a ounce of trekking or off road can see this whole show is a joke. Don't buy it unless your looking for The Real World: Land Rover.,1416700800,,255,4.224489795918367
8280876,4,B001B0XA7I,"Great documentary. Having driven from CA, MN, and VA to Central America, I can relate to the perils of traveling through some of these countries. The odyssey crew highlights the moments into rather short episodes. Overall, it's fun to watch. Worth seeing.",1391904000,,255,5.095238095238095
8280877,5,B001B0XA7I,"Originally edited for TV and shown on many networks around the world, this is an interesting glimpse into a group of well intentioned people accomplishing something most of us just dream about. The complaints about the episodes having previews of other episodes is a little puzzling, as all TV shows aired once per week have recaps and previews.
The Longitude Expedition was to raise awareness and funds for Parkinson's research. This TV show, however, is about the trip- not about Parkinson's reasearch. The show is not about Land Rovers, equipment, sponsors, expedition management, or even the failed Mobil oil test... it's about the people and some of the places they were able to see. If you are looking for a hardcore expo documentary, this is not it. Aimed to entertain, the episodes feature the personalities and the frustrations etc in this type adventure travel. A documentary focused entirely on off-road techniques and expeditions would bore the average viewer to tears.  My 4 year old son watches these DVD's over and over and loves them... and I enjoy them too.
Taken for what it is- a behind the scenes look at a fairly ill-prepared but well intentioned fundraising trip, it's very entertaining.",1295308800,,1209,5.014925373134329
8280878,1,B001B0XA7I,"What a total bunch of freeloading amateurs. 490 days and 41,000 mile holiday for bunch of ill prepared self indulgent fools.

Having been involved in off road driving, building expedition vehicles and adventure motorcycling for a number of years I was appalled and the lack of understanding of what would be needed to complete the trip even on a basic level. Examples are having the correct visas, the ability to communicate in a language other than English, or for that matter map reading by the look of it! This trip was apparently to raise awareness of Parkinson's Disease but they only talk about in perhaps 3 of the 13 episodes for about 15 min in total.
There seems to be no history of why the team is doing this, how they planned their route, who provided their fairly serious sponsorship, why these team members were picked and what their backgrounds were and finally what the end goal was other than to ""increase awareness of Parkinson's""

The fact half the team have to leave due to ""other commitments"" (like a family wedding or other lame excuses) before the journey ends is not even surprising by the time you get to the 2nd dvd. The mechanic allows the one of the most common failures to happen to a Land Rover Discovery II to happen (front drive shaft failure) and seems to be totally surprised and unprepared without a basic $10 spare part that would have fixed it. Not to mention if you know anything about Discos you would have been checking for this.  You should see the drama when they get a flat tire and seem to need a team meeting to decide how to change it (again until Nancy just gets on with it) This along with magic moments like running out of gas in Chili because for the last 10,000 miles they did not think to fill up the extra gas cans on the roof, it really seems like a this could have been a collage road trip for this bunch.

Unable to get up and going in the mornings because of the partying/drinking the night before seems to be an almost daily problem, then getting stuck for days or weeks at borders due to paperwork (way to plan guys)  is not uncommon and you have your so called planner on the trip with you! How about have the correct Visas for China, that would have been good right? No one on my team fell out their chair watching this when they end up months and months behind schedule. Planning for the trip??? It seems they  did not invest in the basics and only took a 2 day off road driving course to get ready to drive around  the world trip in a Land Rover! They have Sat phones and Satellite computer links, laptops and GPS's and still manage to get lost. If you ask me this whole trip was planned sitting in a Starbucks one Sunday morning followed by a quick trip to Borders for a copy of ""idiots guide to road trips"" book which they cannot even have read. Again it boggles the mind what they thought they were doing and honestly if it has not been for Nancy I think they would have all been in a lot more trouble as she was the only one with any common sense.

As for the filming itself, considering you would have had 490 hours of footage if you just filmed one hour per day, it's appalling. Most of it is them shopping or hanging out, none of the hardships of the road, overcoming  adversity or just the splendor of what must have been some of the most fantastic scenery on the planet, or even how the locals live! I would say you get to see footage from less than half the countries they visited but we get 15 min of them on a ferry, drinking and goofing off (again) and whole countries skipped!  As this is a DVD why they felt the need to include the 5 min at the end of each episode that says ""next week on Odyssey "" and show some footage and then when the episode starts we have the same 5 min of footage under the heading  ""this week on Odyssey..."" seemed to show there was no post production put into the creating of the DVD and it was just pumped out as an afterthought.  The final straw for me was every episode had them bitching about how much driving they were doing... really.. driving on a round the world driving trip??? who would have thought that!
If you want to see what a real around the world journey for charity looks like buy the ""Long Way Round"" Two guys ride motorcycles around the world carrying all their gear from London to New York the long way around the world with very limited support and some real hardships. That has some fantastic footage of the places, people and cultures on this planet and shows what real planning is. If you want to see Land Rovers doing what they were made to do get anything from the Camel Trophy Series as the best of the best from different countered come together to make sure everyone finished one of the hardest tests for people and vehicles on earth.  For how documentary's are made get ""Dust to Glory"" the footage shot on the Baja 1000 a few years back but don't waist you time with this sad self indulgent trip with a bunch of people you grow to dislike as the  episodes progress as they piss away a trip of a life time and the chance to raise real awareness for tragic disease.",1291075200,24,5097,4.317991631799163
8280879,5,B001B0XA7I,"Odyssey is like taking that road trip you only imagined about.  These guys drive around the world for 1 1/2 years, meet the Dalai Lama, ride on ships, cross through jungles, deserts and the highest road in the world.  Not to mention they did it all in Land Rovers.  A must have for anyone who loves adventure, its more entertaining than Ewan McGregor's shows but similar in scope, only bigger.  These guys and gals drove 66,000km around the world.  You'll experience the world through their eyes.",1269043200,2,496,4.72093023255814
8280880,5,B001B0XA7I,"I heard about this show randomly, and my biggest complaint is that I don't have any more episodes to watch!!!

I'm personally interested in expedition travel, world travel, and off road vehicles. So to that end, I found the show fascinating. The cast seemed to be some pretty interesting folks, of course you'd have to be to take on a project like this! I appreciate that the makers of this show did not turn it in to some sort of reality TV drama fest. There was just enough interpersonal dynamics to keep it interesting, and give you an idea of their personalities, but thankfully the show kept on the point which was the trip.

I enjoyed the glimpse into what the joys and difficulties of attempting such a trip present. Watching them negotiate new places, new cultures and new roads, was awesome. Check it out, well worth the price.",1242000000,5,836,4.604026845637584
