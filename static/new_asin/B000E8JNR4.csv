2509364,4,B000E8JNR4,A little bit too long. The younget dauther was getting on my nerves all the time but it is a great BBC movie.,1174089600,2,109,3.782608695652174
2509365,4,B000E8JNR4,Good staging of the play althoughbthe could have opened it up a bit.  Part of a bbc series.  DVD includes a second play which was just as good.,1377820800,,143,4.071428571428571
2509366,2,B000E8JNR4,"Because what viewers see is a filming of a play, artifice is emphasized; I couldn't appreciate the quite moving dynamic between Mrs. Warren and her over-protected daughter.  And the irony of the clergyman having ""known"" Mrs. Warren lost its impact and seemed a sophmoric way of making a point.  However, Shaw himself may be to blame about that. This important play, which depends upon huge disparities between so-called respectability of proper professions and Mrs. Warren's profession as competent manager of brothels, looses its edge in this production.  The sets and costumes are ugly.  Nevertheless, if you can forget that and listen to what the characters actually say, you may find yourself becoming involved in the drama.  I was going to watch with friends and recommend to students interested in early discussions about making a living, but the static way of filming the play (I can't think of a different way) makes me think I'm not goinb to watch it again.  In this case, reading the play would probably be more enjoyable.",1376006400,,1032,5.005847953216374
2509367,4,B000E8JNR4,I love my movie collection 97% was bought from amazon I will continue to collect and I do from this sight and all movies were in excellent condition whether bought pre-owned or brand new not once did I receive a broke or scratched movie . Just make sure you read about the seller that they have good scores and reviews.,1374278400,,319,4.333333333333333
2509368,3,B000E8JNR4,This is more like a play. It moved too slowly for me. But if you like plays that are back in time you might like this one.,1360022400,,122,3.5555555555555554
2509369,1,B000E8JNR4,I sat through the first 30 minutes and finally wondered why I was wasting my time.  Even the extra move was dull.  No more Bernard Shaw...,1283212800,,138,4.269230769230769
2509370,4,B000E8JNR4,"I have such mixed emotions about this one. Of course it's excellent because the play was written by George Bernard Shaw. The actors obviously did an excellent job on it. It's the mood of the play that hit me so negatively. It presents us with a heavy message, but so somber and depressing that I wasn't ready for it today.

If you're looking for a ""lived happily ever after"" kind of a story, this isn't it.

If you're looking for a play with an excellent message that causes you to think differently than you did before, this may be your cup of tea.

Perhaps all businessmen and women need to see this one. The message is worth it.
------

There is a bonus called ""You Never Can Tell"" which much better matched my mood. It is hilariously funny. The younger children kept me in stitches. It was romantic comedy at its best. Most of the characters were delightfully improper.",1269388800,,873,4.471698113207547
2509371,5,B000E8JNR4,"How splendid the performances in this gripping suspense drama.  In the reading, Shaw's play can seem flat, but in this production the characteristic Shavian twists and unconventional turns are carefully shaped and the scenes build to their well-defined climaxes.  The costumes and settings are superb, and, happily, the production is not tainted by the Merchant/Ivory style dedicated to the super-realism that comes into fashion later and that distracts so maddeningly from the ongoing drama.

The two women actresses render the conflict between the female leads--Mrs. Warren and Vivie, her daughter--with admirable strength, and the actor playing the cynical Sir George Crofts capably brings to the stage every bit of vileness that Shaw wrote into the role.  His performance is memorable, worthy of comparison to John Gielgud's accomplishment in rendering the vileness of the venerable cynic in the Oscar Wilde Collection's version of The Portrait of Dorian Gray.",1243987200,,964,5.537414965986395
2509372,5,B000E8JNR4,"Both Mrs. Warren's Profession, and You Can Never Tell, are done as plays with all the broad expression expected.  They are at the same time, stiff, and amusing. Completely apropos to their era. Coral Browne does a wonderful job with her role as a woman of the world who did her best, or so she thought, for her daughter. It seems her daughter is more the thinking woman than she would've wished for, and less the loving daughter. The bonus play is lively, very broadly done, and completely enjoyable.",1239840000,5,500,4.617977528089888
2509373,5,B000E8JNR4,"After seeing Mrs. Warren's Profession, it's hard to imagine it being a banned play especially since it's subject matter is mostly implied. Most of the characters are appalled by it and the end is sort of a triumph for morals and the low opinion of people who have a wicked past. It seems to be rooting for everything that is Victorian-for high society, the improvement of women and setting the example for proper behavior and shunning those-even people who are loved should they partake in questionable activities. Some of Shakespeare's plots are a thousand times worse than this--Titus Andronicus anyone?-and I don't recall them being banned in Victorian England. Unless it's because the perpetrators here are women or because the hypocrisy of Victorian society was under fire and of course ...that will never do. In any case, ""Mrs. Warren's Profession"" is a battle of values..or virtue..and both of them make a pretty strong case. Will Mummy be put in her place or will her daughter be kicked off her high-and-mighty pedestal? The final scene will blow you away. The cast are all veteran stage actors and they thoroughly understand Shaw's language and pacing especially Robert Powell-who is hysterical as the sharp-tongued, passionate, neighborhood fop. Powell also appears in the bonus feature ""You Never Can Tell,"" another Shaw comedy. In that one, while there were some good moments, was a little exhausting. It's worth seeing for more of Powell's witty banter-something he obviously enjoys and also for Judy Parfitt who always gives such solid performances (see her in Jewel in the Crown or Dolores Claiborne). Both productions are low budget and sometimes with other BBC productions, movies filmed on stage sets can be a little jarring, but the setting on these films is rather charming and it becomes secondary, to these wonderful, brilliant actors.",1231718400,7,1857,5.132013201320132
2509374,3,B000E8JNR4,Bernard Shaw rather more serious than in Pygmalion and certainly at his best.  The film proceeds almost as though the action were on the stage.  Shaw was a fabian and we are in the middle of the women's rights movement.  You expect to see Mrs Pankhurst.,1186876800,3,253,4.456521739130435
8107038,2,B000E8JNR4,"As a fan of period dramas, I now know why I've never heard of this movie before - it's so dull. It had to be a C-rated film of it's time.",1520985600,,137,3.4516129032258065
8107039,3,B000E8JNR4,"OK, but felt it was rather brief.  I'm sure the book has to be better because the movie left me wanting . . . more of something . . .Not necessarily more movie, but more story.",1462492800,,176,3.888888888888889

8107044,4,B000E8JNR4,"Very solid production, true to the original text, and well-acted. Pulls no punches, so it's easy to see why the play was so controversial that it couldn't be performed in England until 20 years after it was written.",1427068800,,215,4.684210526315789
8107045,5,B000E8JNR4,"Though I thought these BBC productions a bit dated, it was really interesting to see many of these actors I am familiar with in twentieth century productions when they where youthful in their acting careers with BBC acting still performing now in the twenty-first century.  You really see how these actors where going to become the great actors they are now.  The evolution in these actors performance is delightful to witness in these early performances of BBC.",1414886400,,462,4.987012987012987
8107046,5,B000E8JNR4,"One of the best of Coral Browne's TV appearances to survive. If you are studying this actress, as you should, her Mrs Warren hits the spot. In real life Browne, who was born in Australia, had a common side to her which was well known in her witty remarks but usually she kept it well hidden in performance. In Mrs Warren she gives it free rein to great effect. This performance is also notable for the role of her straight laced daughter, played by Downton Abbey's Penelope Wilton and their denouement scene sings.",1413763200,,514,4.537634408602151
8107047,5,B000E8JNR4,"Coral Browne was mostly as stage actress, but her acerbic, stylish characters occasionally graced movies that were worthy of her talent. Penelope Wilton is best known for ""Pride and Prejudice"" and as Isobel Crawley on ""Downton Abbey."" They are both delicious in this adaptation of Shaw's play for the BBC.

Penelope Wilton is the daughter of a successful business woman whose true profession is profitable, but not respectable. She must come to terms with the fact that her mother's generous support has come at a price. Her mother, played by Coral Browne, tries to build a relationship with a daughter who has inherited her talent for business and strong will. The male characters are less successfully inhabited, but overall this is a well-crafted production.",1396915200,,761,5.137096774193548
