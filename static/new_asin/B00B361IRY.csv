5554491,1,B00B361IRY,I bought this exact DVD from Walmart and everything from that Wrestlemania is on there EXCEPT the Hogan vs Warrior main event. I thought maybe my DVD skipped over the match so I went to the chapters selection to find it and it is seriously not on the DVD. I don't understand. I wish I could post a picture of the chapter this. DVD ends with honkey tonk man and Greg the hammer singing,1385424000,,384,4.202702702702703
5554492,5,B00B361IRY,"I purchased the VHS in 1990.... I am so glad I bought this DVD! What a Memorable Wrestle Mania! Im glad WWE kept it to the original recording with all the Commentary and Interviews (before the matches). It really brought me back to my childhood watching and listening to all of the wrestlers theme songs! I look forward on showing my kids this DVD! In my opinion, this is wrestling at its finest !!!!!!!",1384560000,5,403,4.45945945945946
5554493,1,B00B361IRY,"I purchased this item in the hopes that one of the mightiest wrestling battles in history would take place once again before my very eyes.. Remembering it as a child it was Titan against Titan. With this embedded in my mind for 20 or more years I felt it was time to relive those moments. I even called my friends, they were shocked and envious at my high brow tactics. But... as I scrolled around looking for the mightiest fight ever conceived on the DVD, Hulk vs The Ultimate Warrior... IT WASN'T EVEN ON THE THING!!!!!!!! WHO WANTS TO WATCH ANY OF THE OTHER FIGHTS?! THAT'S LIKE BUYING A MOVIE TO WATCH THE PREVIEWS!!! I SCROLLED AND I SCROLLED BROTHER BUT THE BATTLE OF THE MILLENNIUM WASN'T THERE!!! I thought it must be some kind of mistake, were my eyes deceiving me?! Had some wretched gypsy woman put a curse on me cause I only ate half the falafel before throwing it away?!?! Was there really a devil?! And if so then there must be a God?!! If so has he surely abandoned me?! Left me like Prometheus pecked away by poultry?!?! With this in mind there was only one choice for me then... Dress up like Hulk Hogan and break everything I've ever purchased from amazon with my face!! But after a minute or so I said nah... So instead ill just give you one star and list things you could do with the money you duped from me:
1) paint yourself like the ultimate warrior and punch yourself in the face for 48hrs straight
2) dress up like hulk hogan and punch yourself in the face for 48hrs straight
3) paint yourself like the ultimate warrior but dress like Hulk Hogan and punch yourself in the face for 48hrs straight.. Rinse then repeat.. :)",1373587200,,1645,4.379084967320262
5554494,4,B00B361IRY,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""

This was the first ever international WrestleMania as it was held in the SkyDome from Toronto, Ontario, Canada that also set an attendance record for that arena at over 67.000.  Various celebrities in attendance include Steve Allen, Rona Barrett, and Robert Goulet signing ""Oh Canada"" while the story is widely known now that future WWE superstar & Hall Of Fame member Edge was in attendance.

""The Ultimate Challenge"" was what defined this WrestleMania as it was a main event under circumstances that we've never seen before & have never seen since as both the WWE & Intercontinental Championships were on the line as the two biggest & most popular superstars in WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior one on one for the first time with the crowd being split in half as what has gone down as one of the greatest matches in both men's careers.  Other matches include Andre The Giant's final WWE match defending the Tag Team Championships with Haku vs. Demolition, Dusty Rhodes sole WrestleMania in-ring appearance teaming with Sapphire against Randy Savage & Sherri featuring the surprise appearance of Miss Elizabeth, a rare Million $ Championship title defense by Ted Dibiase vs. Jake Roberts, Bad News Brown vs. Roddy Piper who's physical look was controversial to say the least, Mr. Perfect defending his undefeated record against Brutus Beefcake, Jimmy Snuka vs. Rick Rude, Big Boss Man vs. Akeem, Jim Duggan vs. Dino Bravo, Rockers vs. Orient Express, Tito Santana vs. Barbarian, Hart Foundation vs. Bolsheviks, Earthquake vs. Hercules, and Koko B. Ware vs. Hercules.

Now this Mania was definitely remembered for the main event but the rest of the card had it's memorable moments like Dusty Rhodes solo Mania match, Ms. Elizabeth's appearance, Roddy Piper being his usual controversial self, and Andre's last match while the undercard action itself was more solid than the previous year so it's a Mania that I would recommend for the collection.",1364601600,2,2294,5.026315789473684
