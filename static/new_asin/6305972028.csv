1111018,5,6305972028,"To be frank (pun intended), when I saw the first movie on LaserDisc, I was confused and uninterested...a typical reaction from a 13 yr old, I guess.  It wasn't until I saw Hellbound two years later did I realize that I had lacked the maturity and attention span needed to enjoy the Hellraiser story.  I realized there was so much more beyond the scope of low budget makeup and effects...there was a story being told, a story about the human condition, showing how insidious and evil humans truely can be. All of a sudden, I realized the cenobites were not really demons at all, it had been the humans!  The cenobites were merely there to keep order and abide by the laws.  A nice twist in my opinion.
So, as soon as I heard there was a Limited Edition DVD release four years later I jumped at the opportunity.  I wasn't dissapointed.  Picture quality easily rivaled if not bettered that of the LaserDisc transfer.  The 5.1 soundtrack was outstanding for the most part, with a few hisses here and there and modest use of LFE.  I was glad to see that Anchor Bay included the ""extended"" version of Hellbound with scenes missing from the initial theatrical release and the subsequent VHS release.  However, it's nothing new.  The LaserDisc version of Hellbound had these scenes as well.  What it did lack was something I had hoped for; The surgery scene and the Chatterer transformation scene.  To their credit, I've heard those scenes were so terribly done that it was laughable.  However, it still would have been a treat to see those long lost strips of celluloid.  I doubt if they even exist anymore.
The technical merit of this release is laudable.  However, the decision to incase the DVDs in a 2 disc jewel case was a mistake.  I would have liked keep cases so I could include them on my DVD shelf with the rest of my DVDs.  Now, I have this awkward tin case in the middle of my collection.  I did enjoy the booklet with the rare behind the scenes photos as well as the poster inserts.  The Tin Box is quite neat but looks out of place.  I really enjoyed the commentaries.  They were insightful and sometimes humurous.  The mini documentaries were also well done.  All in all, a terrific effort and a great addition to my DVD collection...it's the jewel case that bugs me to no end.  I might have to go and purchase the individual DVDs with the keep cases just so I can rest easy and then display the tin box somewhere else.  Then again, that was the plan all along wasn't it Anchor Bay?",964224000,,2490,4.48
1111019,3,6305972028,"A modern horror classic in its own right, Hellraiser makes for a great night with popcorn and friends. The movie basically focuses on a device (a small rubbix cube box) which acts as a portal for good old pin head, a bad  guy that basically kills people in the most gruesome ways. The movie has a  flavor of 80's horror films which can never be replicated in the sea of CGI  and computer special effects that exists nowadays. This Limited Tin set  includes both the first and second installments on this great series for  double the mayhem. As a collector's item it is a great purchase. As a  horror classic you basically owe it to yourself to experience it if you  haven't already. This is the perfect chance. Highly recommended.",962582400,8,730,4.569230769230769

1111054,5,6305972028,For those of you who want all three original Hellrasier films this box is your best bet to get Hellrasier III as so far it is not sold in too many regions alone.  I saw the original Hellrasier back when it was released at the drive-in and like the series.  It is nice to finally see it get this awesome treatment it deserves.  The bonus disc included in this box set is packed with some nice features and behind the scenes stuff.  If you want Hellraiser III and can try to get your hands on this box I say do it and you'll never regret it.,1504051200,,539,4.056603773584905
1111055,4,6305972028,"When the first HELLRAISER film came out I was stunned. Here we were presented with an all new concept of horror that wed never been exposed to. We were given new monsters to fear. Thats rare in most horror films that rely on the tried and true creatures weve grown accustomed to. That was 30 years ago and for younger viewers this is now the norm. That wasn't so when it was released.

Arrow Video has done an amazing job of collecting the first three of the movies in a series that has seen highs only to drop down to lows. I mean the odds were pretty good that would happen when you consider there have been over 10 Hellraiser films made and the characters have even been launched into outer space. That happens when creative control moves to studios bent on creating a franchise instead of film makers handling the reins. This collection contains the first three films, the ones that actually feel a natural flow running through them.

If youve never seen them and love horror films by all means this is the best way to start. The first film tells the story of Frank (Sean Chapman), a seeker of the most intense sexual pleasure willing to delve into the supernatural, who finds a mysterious engraved cube puzzle. Opening it he releases the Cenobites, creatures from another dimension that deal in extreme sadomasochism, who then literally rip him to shreds via chains and hooks. Fast forward to Larry (Andrew Robinson), his wife Julia (Clare Higgins) and teen daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) moving into his old family home. A small cut and drop of blood are enough to feed the last vestiges of Frank buried in the floorboards upstairs. Rebuilding his body on blood he recruits Clare, a woman who had an affair with him long ago and has more passion for Frank than Larry, to lure men to the house to use their bodies to regenerate. With the box still in play, the killer duo still in love, Cenobites seeking an escaped Frank and a curious daughter on hand nothing good can come of it.

This is by far the best of the films made. Much of that has to be credited to the fact that the author of the story, Clive Barker, also directed this film. It is original as Ive stated and contains so many nightmare inducing images that the odds of forgetting the film are impossible. Everything here works to make one of the most effective horror films made in the last 50 years.

The second film, HELLRAISER II ties directly into the first. Ashley is taken to an institution following the events of the first film. Unfortunately for her the man in charge, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), has been looking for the Lament Configuration (the box) for years. Items from the Kirstys home are brought in, including the blood soaked mattress where SPOILER ALERT Clare met her demise in the first film. Like Frank before her, she is rejuvenated with the help of Channard. The doorway to the world of the Cenobites is once more opened and Kirsty is the only hope of closing that door.

Sequels are difficult to make, mostly because the newness and surprise of the first film is no longer possible. But this one holds up remarkably well. It builds on the foundation of the first film providing us with a new potential threat in Channard and also giving us more background on the original main Cenobite, Pinhead (Doug Bradley). Well-made with someone else at the helm, it is perhaps one of the best horror sequels ever made.

Then we get to the third film, HELLRAISER III: HELL ON EARTH, is where things begin to stray a bit. Encased in an obelisk purchased by a playboy nightclub owner, Pinhead and the Lament Configuration are seeking a way to escape. Luring the playboy into helping them murders once again begin. An investigative journalists looks into these murders only to put herself in the path of the Cenobites as well.

Its not a bad movie and actually is fairly entertaining. But it also shows the problems that one runs into with sequels. Actors from previous films begin to leave the series (although Laurence appears here for the last time in the series), the originality wears off and the surprises stem less from the story and more from the effects. Still, this one doesnt stray so far as to make it unworthy. It remains the best last sequel in the series.

The box set is amazing and Arrow Video has gone to extreme lengths to make sure that fans are taken care of. Not only are all three films presented in 2k restorations but the amount of extras on hand here is phenomenal. To list them all, which I normally try and do, would be to add a complete extra page to this write up. A short list includes a poster, book, documentaries on the films, scripts, interviews, trailers and more.

If you are a fan of the series then Arrow has you in mind with this one. It shows not only the best copies available of all three films but the fact that they remain one of the best companies around when it comes to putting together projects like this. And it makes you hope that they continue to do so in the future.",1503878400,,5003,4.53769401330377

1111092,5,6305972028,"What a gorgeous collection. The box itself is a deep scarlet with a matte finish, very solid. A diamond shaped opening on one side reveals the contents labeled on their individual cases. The four discs each have a beautiful non-latching case book. Another case contains a number of small, frameable art prints and a folded double-sided poster. Finally there is the book. I was blown away by the quality of the book, everything from the sturdy hardcover to the cover art to the thoroughly detailed contents. Easily my favorite part of the set, it's just magnificent.
As to the films themselves, Hellraiser and Hellbound: Hellraiser II are both fantastic, whereas I personally feel part III lacks the gravitas of its predecessors, although it isn't entirely without its charms. I haven't screened the copy of Hell on Earth included here, but parts one and two both look great at least compared to my previous copies on DVD. I cannot compare the quality to any prior Blu Ray releases, having only seen the DVD releases.
Overall this set is wonderfully designed and presented. Looks great as a display piece or on the shelf with the rest of your collection. I couldn't be happier with having this box in my library. Highly recommended for fans of the series or great horror movies in general.",1489708800,7,1288,4.832579185520362
1111093,5,6305972028,"I kinda wouldn't mind a complete boxset of ALL the Hellraiser movies, but 1-3 are really the best.  This boxset rewards fans of Barker.  The design of the boxset itself and then all the bonus features AND the book....this is what horror fans have been waiting for.  I'd like to see part 4 come to blu ray, but this will keep us all happy for the long run!",1489536000,5,355,4.1911764705882355
1111094,4,6305972028,"Cliver Barker's writing debut of the Books of Blood shook up the world of horror with its wild inventiveness, dispensing beauty and horror in equal measure, captured the imagination of millions of readers. The story The Hellbound Heart of this collection was at the ... well ... heart of the first movie of Barker's classic Hellraiser series, which in Pinhead created an icon forever joining the pantheon of horror greats.
The missing star is due to the inclusion of part three of the series which shows a great drop in quality in story line and adds nothing new to the mythology, painfully making aware that Clive Barker was no longer at the helm of this sinking cinematic vessel.
The first two however are classic horror gems not to be missed by any true horror aficionado.
The picture quality is ok, but not more than that. The additional material of this box is great when you are a fan, which I am, but you obviously are if you are willing to pay this amount for these movies.
All in all, I'm very pleased the first two movies got the treatment they deserve, more so, that its myriad fans deserve.",1489536000,,1102,4.570707070707071
1111095,4,6305972028,"I would've probably given this a miss for the price (I paid about $79 for it) if I hadn't been convinced of its high quality -- a nice sturdy scarlet box, exclusive bonus DVD, and hardbound book with stuff worth reading.  These extra features are incapable of doing anything to enhance the picture or the sound of the actual movies, but they are well-made and lots of fun to open up and goggle at.  There are also some cool art cards and a poster.

Being a fan of the first two films, and only the first two films, I can say that paying this much for those two plus the third one, doesn't make the third one any better than it already was.  I see the third film as a wild romp, a crazy monster movie, and that can be a lot of fun, but for me it lacks the genuine drama and gravitas of the first two, and I believe it kind of cheapens 'Pinhead' as it overuses him and perhaps pushes him somewhat out of character.  I was kind of hoping I'd like #3 more now, but I still find myself wishing it was a different movie with different monsters that have nothing do with Hellraiser -- then I'd probably laugh and enjoy it more!  (By the way, Doug Bradley is a wonderful perfomer -- the weaknesses of this particular movie are not his fault!)

I've read some complaints about the picture quality.  I'm pretty happy with it myself.  To me it looks better than any previous release. Where some of it appears very grainy, this is what film looks like.  I don't want that look processed away.  They have removed dirt and smudges and scratches and all that kind of thing.  If the video quality is at all disappointing, it is only because we can imagine that in the next few years, someone will do 4k scans of the original negatives and do a pure restoration job on THAT and it will look EVEN BETTER.  And we thought back in the 2000's with DVDs we'd never have to buy the same movies more than twice again!

The hardcover book is nice.  It radiates quality.  You pick it up and think, have I washed my hands first?  Don't want to mess this thing up....  Start looking through it, start reading it.  See you in a couple of hours.  You can tell a good chunk of the money you spent on this box was put into this book.

The bonus disc has two early Clive Barker shorts sourced from very low quality degraded film (apparently) and they're interesting.  Have you ever watched David Lynch's early short films?  The Alphabet?  This is nowhere near that level of quality (ha ha), but... interesting.  The other bonus content is... also interesting.  I can't really gush about any of it.

The bottom line:  Big fans and collectors will want to consider seriously buying this.  But if you just want the new transfers and their specific documentaries, you could probably wait and buy the same Arrow discs later individually and just give up on having this special bonus disc, book, cards, poster, and box.  I gave this release four out of five because I like it.  I don't love it, because it's a bit pricey and I only love two of the three films.

Below the bottom line:  For anyone considering this box set, I probably don't need to review films one and two.  They will be the reason you are here.  I could write a very long essay about why they work so well, especially the first one.  Briefly:  I believe the magic is in the underlying drama of the human characters combined with the fascination of occult horror and the strange worldliness of the 'Pinhead' character.  If you stripped away all the supernatural elements from these two stories, you would still have the basis for gripping, frightening drama -- you'd have to write a bunch of material to fill in for the supernatural events, but Julia, Frank, and the Doctor would still be remarkably creepy, sadistic people.  They are deliciously evil characters who we understand almost completely after one viewing, and their motivations are quite believable -- they want more.  A lot more.  And they're willing to do anything to get it.  We stare into the abyss and the madman compels us to jump.  We do not jump.  Julia, Frank, and the Doctor -- oh, they jump.  And we get to watch.",1488412800,15,4114,4.426666666666667

The post cards, the booklet and the poster are fine but again, not worth the big ticket price on this. As for the bonus documentary, housed in its own cheaply constructed little folder with pathetic artwork, its nothing to write home about either. Considering this came from Arrow Video, I am shocked.

When I found out Arrow was releasing it in the states, i was beyond excited. however, at the time, i did not have the money to get it. I read it was going to be limited and again i was crushed since i am a big Clive Barker fan and have many of his novels. but fortunately, i made some extra money on ebay and picked this up as a present to myself and i am so glad i did. the set is really nice and packaged very well. the book is a nice solid hard cover, the disc are packaged in digipaks and the poster/cards/etc are packaged in a seperate packaging. also included besides the first three films are a bonus disc featuring clive barkers short films and more about him. cant wait to watch that one! the bonus features for all three films are specatcular! Arrow really went above and beyond. Now my complaints. Hellraiser 1 had a pretty descent blu ray transfer and looked great in 1080p. not perfect but better then the original dvd. however, hellraiser 2 had a terrible transfer and looked muddy and poor on blu ray. looked more dvd quality so was a bit disappointed with that. part 3 had a decent transfer as well. not as stunning as part 1 but a lot better then part 2. other complaint, why wasn't part 4 included? i know after 4 they all went straight to dvd and were mostly crap but since 1-4 did get theatrical releases i would of expected 4 to be included. i would of liked to have seen the original version with the work print scenes included with the original ending. makes for a much better movie! overall though, a very good set. the price may be a tad high for some but remember, Arrow put a lot of work into this set which does cost money. with the book, prints, documentries, bonus features, deleted scenes etc its not going to be cheap. i personally feel it was well worth the 78 i paid. and im glad i did.",1484784000,9,1881,4.184573002754821

1111131,5,6305972028,"I'm a long time collector of limited and special edition blu-rays.  When this title was originally released in the UK only, I missed out on snagging a copy before it sold out.  I later purchased the non limited UK edition that was also from Arrow Video and included the trilogy only on three discs.  When I heard that Arrow was going to re-release the title in Region A with the same swag, I was so excited to have the opportunity to nab a copy for myself.
The outer box is produced in a very sturdy cardboard and resembles a puzzle box with an opening on the front spine where you can see all of the contents inside through a little window into the contents.  When you lift the front cover off, you see the first Hellraiser disc which has a puzzle box image on the cover.  Each movie is housed in a slim plastic tray with an outer cardboard cover which has similar puzzle box art on one side, and some iconic images from the trilogy on the other side.
Now we get to the exclusive items that are only found in The Scarlet Box.
*  exclusive blu ray with a TON of extras including; two early Barker films ( a little weird but interesting) a documentary on Barker's books, a new documentary that looks at the whole franchise, along with some other items.
* 200 page hardcover book that looks in depth at the three films enclosed along with a lot of other behind the scenes essays
* a reversible poster printed on heavy weight paper
* 5 very cool postcards with images from the trilogy
* a 20 page booklet with some never before seen artwork by Barker
This is by far one of the very finest special edition blu ray box sets I've ever seen.  The quality of the outer box and all of the enclosed materials are top notch.  If you're not familiar with Arrow Video, they're a UK company that I would say Scream Factory is an equivalent US producer of horror titles on blu ray.  I've been collecting them for the last few years since I purchased a region-free blu ray player, and am very excited that they've recently started to produce titles that are playable in the US.  If you have a region-free player, I would strongly suggest you check out their other titles, many of which have never been released in the US on blu ray.  If you're a casual Barker fan, this set is probably a little too pricey for you.  If you love the original Hellraiser films, you owe it to yourself to snag this up before it disappears.  It is truly a gorgeous set, and you will be glad you added it to your collection.",1484265600,5,2486,4.309012875536481

1111133,5,6305972028,"I thought long and hard about getting this set and decided to buy it despite the price. There are some film grain issues that are quite noticeable in the first two films especially in dark scenes. Some people don't mind film grain while others do and it just depends on the viewer watching the film. It does happens sometimes when transferring older films to Blu Ray, but in my opinion it's still the best these movies have ever looked on screen. The sound quality is amazingly sharp and clear and the extras in this boxset are well worth the purchase.",1483488000,2,552,4.53

1111135,3,6305972028,"After having viewed all three of the film transfers I have to say that this box set is grossly overpriced. So grateful that I remained patient and didn't shell out the big bucks for the earlier UK set! Even at half of suggested retail I would not likely recommend this...The movies themselves really do look ""that bad"". True,its not all bad as some of the extras are new and unique to this set and are generally pretty interesting and well done. For that fact I give the set, as a whole, 3 stars - It's ""o.k."".
So this all prompts a question: are the surviving source elements in such a poor state that a true HD presentation is impossible?? I've truly seen better digital transfers from 16 MM film elements than this (Hellraiser in particular looks disappointingly soft and grainy). Is this really the best these movies can look or is this a cash grab? Looks like at least some of us are still waiting for the definitive Hellraiser presentation.",1483401600,4,946,4.570588235294117

1111169,4,6305972028,"All right I thought i would do a review once i got this myself and watched it, as others on here either were just negative reviews or positive ones that praised it without mentioning the actual quality of the film transfers themselves. I just am going to review the movies themselves.

To start the rumors about grain are true. Most notably the 1st film. While i did see some grain throughout it in no way looked bad or was distracting to the film experience. In fact grain aside i thought it looked amazing both in picture clarity and color. The new 5.1 mix was also quite good for the 1st film. A definite improvement to the old dvd. The 1st film when i think of grain reminds me of this constant gripe everyone has with blu ray transfers with grain. They either argue that if a film has grain that is bad and should be cleaned and removed, but then they also argue that too much DNR clean up ruins the films original look and that's bad too. It's damned if you do and damned if don't with film clean up nowadays.

Any ways moving on. Hellraiser 2 looked great as well and had virtually no grain at all. So nothing to complain about there, though i did notice some visual effects didn't look as great in blu ray. Some stop motion here and there and some fuzzy moments like for me was the big spanning shot of the labyrinth at the middle of the film with channard and julia. You'll see it right at the main menu shown in a short loop of footage from the film. That aside it did also have one other thing i didn't find too great: the 5.1 mix isn't too good. I don't know if it is just my setup or not but it sounded muffled down. Like it wasn't splitting the sound to all the channels very well. It sounded like a bad stereo to me. I ended up just using the pcm stereo hd.

Ok now onto the 3rd film. Unfortunately much like how the 3rd film is the weak link in the trilogy, so is the blu ray quality. It looks ok, nothing special. Not all that high rez looking. The sound was also nothing special just you're average stereo. I had to keep turning it up at parts when they talked and back down during the effects and explosions.

Ok so having seen all 3 of these i can agree that arrow overcharged for this. They are definitely worth getting if you can find it cheap. Hope this review helps people to know what you are getting.",1482278400,11,2326,4.185267857142857
1111170,2,6305972028,"I'm a long term fan of Clive Barker and the Hellraiser series, having owned multiple versions of the first three movies on VHS and DVD. I was so excited for the Scarlet Box I ordered it sight unseen, which was a mistake in retrospect.

To start with, the films themselves look and sound good with new 1080P transfers and 5.1 mixes for the first two films. If that's all you came for, you'll probably be happy except for the price.

The promised special features however are disappointing and disjointed. Instead of creating a new documentary, Arrow recycled the Leviathan documentary (which was funded in a 2014 Kickstarter) into three separate parts, one for each of the films.  Compared to the excellent new documentaries on Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, Leviathan feels pretty amateurish. Because it's been hacked into three pieces, it is also poorly edited and doesn't flow well, and it has a jarring title sequence on each disk which goes for nearly five minutes. Leviathan does have most of the major actors with the exception of Clive Barker and Ashley Laurence, which partly makes up for some of the flaws.

There are a couple of other random interviews (e.g. Sean Chapman), and all of the other special features are recycled from previous releases, especially the 2004 Anchor Bay special edition which most fans will be familiar with (including Clive's cigar chewing comment that he would never speak about Hellraiser again). All of the commentaries appear to be from the Anchor Bay release of the films as well, so there is nothing new there for the hardcore fans.

Annoyingly, the audio mix on some special features and commentary is inconsistent. Some of them are proper 5.1 mixes with dialog in the center channel, and others are stereo mixes and difficult to follow e.g. the Hickox/Bradley commentary on Hellraiser 3 sounds terrible on my system. Leviathan appears to have audio mix problems as well in some scenes.

The fourth disk is the most disappointing. I already had the two Clive Barker films Salome and The Forbidden from previous release. The low point is the Hellraiser Evolution documentary made by Arrow Video themselves, which takes the cake for pure filler. It's especially frustrating because it's mostly pontification of talentless hacks like Rick Bota and Scott Derrickson who made the terrible sequels Hellraiser 5, 6, 7 and 8, along with other random people you've never heard of with no connection to the Hellraiser films. This documentary has nothing to say in regard to the original Hellraiser trilogy and was a total missed opportunity by Arrow to actually add something new to the Hellraiser canon. I'd rather drink bleach than watch it again.

Finally, Arrow Video have the most annoying and amateurish logo sequence, which gives the whole package a kind of low budget feel. I saw a review that compared Arrow to Criterion, but in my estimation you are paying Criterion prices for a product that lacks overall quality and care.",1482192000,14,2982,4.940119760479042

Of all the bonuses the addition of the infamous doctor scene in Hellraiser 2 was extremely satisfying. As were Barker's early works.",1480377600,3,384,4.1891891891891895

In this set you get Hellraiser 1,2,3 a bonus 4th disc & a 200 page hardback book (4th disc & book exclusive to the LE set) all for a pretty good price considering what it comes with. The films themselves are great, especially the first 2 being excellent & the 3rd very good. Lots of bonus features here sure to please any big fan of the series such as myself, ive only just glanced at the book but that seems like a very worthwhile read as well. I won't get too much into the plot of them since that can be found in any number of places & chances are if you are on this page you already know about the films but in short opening a puzzle box summons demons who come to take you away & torture you for eternity. I haven't seen all the extras yet but being a fan I cant wait until I can get into the rest of them. If you are a fan of Arrow Video releases or the Hellraiser series in general this boxset is a MUST own & is well worth it.

Edit: Ok, so ive finally gotten around to watching all the extras including disc 4. The 2 short films from Barker Salome & The Forbidden. Both are in black & white, no dialog. The Forbidden is the longer of the 2 but I enjoyed Salome a bit more. It had better atmosphere I feel. Theyre not films you will probably watch a bunch of times but are at least worth watching once if nothing else. Hellraiser: A Question of Faith was ok at best also. Its obviously not really polished & according to the set it was supposed to be the basis for a Hellraiser TV series. The effects as you would expect aren't that great but the 1 Cenobite you see isn't all bad looking & overall I feel he was the best part of this, also worth watching at least once. The other features looking at the Hellrasier franchise as awhole & looking at Clive Barker's works were both very good & well worth watching for fans of Hellrasier & Barker.",1480291200,5,1989,4.086956521739131

They are a true indie/underground distributor that can be trusted (Unlike others like Twilight Times)
This limited box set isn't for the casual Hellraiser fan
It's for any Hardcore Hellraiser/Clive Barker fan
It's on par with the Limited edition Nightbreed Blu-ray set put out by Scream Factory a few years ago
Why it's worth the major price hike???
Twilight Times sells limited editions all the time
85% of the times they are bare boned or have previous extras ported from the original dvd
There prices are always $29.99 a pop for a blu-ray with no new exclusives
This box set is the complete opposite it has a lot of awesome exclusives major HQ extras
Region (A) collectors also should understand this limited box set sold out at a record number during it's first UK release
So this limited box set is going to sell out quick
The box itself is extremely heavy it weights at least 3-5lbs
It feels like a brick
If you really want it I high suggest getting it

First things first if you are a huge Horror/B-Movie fan do yourself a favor and get a region free blu-ray player
They are around $135.00 or less  for a decent one that will last for a while
You can even buy region free players on amazon
There are lots and i mean lots of amazing Region (B) Blu-ray disc out there
The only major negative for this limited set (Region A) is the price
I payed around $70.00 US when i bought the Limited Scarlet Box set (Region B) Direct from Arrow Video
I'd think the US Set will drop down a bit more at least to $70.00 give or take before the street date

It's a amazing box set if you are a hardcore fan you'll dig it
There's is plenty of bang for your buck (The extras are massive and all very enjoyable)
But, i would suggest waiting a little closer to the release date The Limited Edition of Creepshow 2 went down a good chunk so I'm sure this will go down more in the SRP  10/10

Otherwise the Box would have held no fascination for them.... A spiritually centered being , such as a saint or a shaman, can laugh as he is being flayed by demons (or Cenobites.)

These have everything a horror fan could want. Great enigmatic characters, interesting historical content, a plan and a purpose. What is unique is that we don't get the whole story.... There is so much left to wanting to see into further. It opens itself up to very imaginative alternatives and background follow-up. Sadly though the sequels to follow give us some information but end up mostly disappointing with weird surreal outcomes. Hellbound is where a true followup should start. Take us into this psuedo Dante experience and deliver the horrific nature of Pinhead's domain..... this is what true HR fans want to see! Why does the HR series have to become another teen thriller as in later versions, or Pinhead a metaphor for wrong doings?..... get back to the dark nature of the Cenobites and Let's see what sites he has to show us!!!

1111212,4,6305972028,"Fantastic horror film!!  If one ignores the Hellraise II plot inconsistencies (i.e., we're in England...no, the STATES!!!--hence the 4 stars), it makes a wonderful horror film devoted to the followers of forbidden pleasures.
Of course, pleasure has its price...a one-way ticket to hell...unless, of course, someone brings you back.
An intense sexual affair causes Uncle Frank to be brought back from the dead...and he can only regenerate if he gets more blood.  This sets the scene for the first Hellraiser movie where Kirstie (Frank's brother's daughter) thwarts evil.
The second movie delves into Hell itself and involves Kirstie trying to find her father there (who had become a victim in the 1st film).  Hell looks like someone's basement, true, but I can imagine a hell where nothing looked different as you keep walking, and walking, and walking....
Subject to your own interpreation to be sure.  Unfortunately, it was subsequently followed by 2 poor sequels.  The only saving grace of Hellraise III is one of my favorite Pinhead quotes from all of the films:  ""There is no good, Monroe, there is no evil...there is only flesh, and the patterns to which we submit it.""",990144000,3,1174,5.05699481865285

Now the perennial horror movie home video company, Anchor Bay, has released what has to be one of their very best DVD sets ever.  Including both the original and its sequel (both in THX sound) in a single tin is the smartest thing to do.

1111215,4,6305972028,"HELLRAISER: A typical, naive husband and his sexual unsatisfied wife move into a lonely old house that has the misfortune of containing the shredded remains of his soon-to-be-resurrected evil brother. Clever, well plotted and genuinely disturbing.  Directing debut for horror novelist Clive Barker, and still remains to be his undisputed masterpiece.  HELLRAISER II: Takes off hours later where the original finished. The sole survivor of the family massacre Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) finds herself in a mental hospital run by an occult-obsessed psychiatrist with a determination to open the gates to hell and the whole nightmare starts all over again. Not too bad a film as far as sequels go. Definatelly a work of art compared to the following chapters. Only this film was butchered by the MPAA on its theatrical release and lost a lot of its well deserved respect. THE DVD: Both films are THX certified which delivers clear enough picture and a beautifully haunting 5.1 Dolby track, and are presented in their original 1.85:1 widescreen format and a 4:3  fullscreen presentation. Both DVDs feature the original theatrical trailer, a picture gallery, a commentary track and a doco on each film. Both documentaries are entertaining and informative, but the one for Hellraier, ""Resurrection"", is much longer and more enjoyable than the one for Hellraiser II, ""Lost in the Labryinth"". The only letdown of this wonderful treatment is the absence of a Deleted Scenes section, especially for Hellraiser II. The two infamous scenes of Pinhead and the Female cenobite dressed as doctors, and chatterer going through the process of his face undergoing disgusting changes are scenes that every fan is howling to see which is a real let down. Both discs come packaged in a limited edition tin which is a definate must for any cult horror collector. This edition also contains a 48 page booklet with rare, behind the scenes pictures from Hellraiser which is always delightfully ugly to look at. The only downside of the packaging is the way the discs were packaged. They are both in a standard 2-CD case which is terriblly unsatisfactory. But apart from one or two issues, its a fair enough edition which will be a well treasured collector's item in the near-future.",981331200,11,2255,5.089189189189189

1111217,4,6305972028,"""Hellraiser"" still stands out as one of the most intruguing, visually morbid, and utterly dark horror films I've seen. I was not particularly scared but more so astonished by the visuals I was seeing: Hooks piercing flesh, bodies writhing out of floorboards from the taste of blood, eroticism and desire as a catalyst for horror, a man with nails banged into his head. I still believe these images and themes are what gives (at least the first movie) its lasting appeal. ""Hellraiser"" is centered around a box described in Clive Barker's novel ""The Hellbound Heart"" as the Lament Configuration. By solving the puzzle of this box, one opens up a world of pleasure and pain. A man named Frank who solved the secrets of the box is torn apart but is gorily ressurected by the blood of his brother Larry. Driven by desire, Frank's former lover and Larry's wife Julia helps Frank literally put the skin back on his bones. It isn't long before beings known as Cenobites come searching for Frank while Larry's daughter Kirsty becomes inadvertently involved in the mayhem. The special edition of this DVD includes a great audio commentary by Barker and star Ashley Laurence as well as a making-of documentary. ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" is an uneven, ambitious, but overall not-so-satisfying film also included in this set. Hours after the events that concluded the original ""Hellraiser,"" Kirsty finds herself in a hospital run by a doctor obsessed with the occult. This eventually leads to the Lament Configuration, a journey into hell, and a look into who the Cenobites were. Not as good as the original but still relatively entertaining, ""Hellbound"" does contain one particularly disturbing and infamous scene involving a crazed man and a shaving razor. ""Hellbound"" comes with similar extras as ""Hellraiser"" (commentary with director Tony Randel, writer Peter Atkins, and star Ashley Laurence; documentary, etc.). My one complaint of the set is the cumbersome packaging which consists of a large tin box, something that Anchor Bay has done with other DVD special editions like Fulci's ""The Beyond"". I cannot say what compelled Anchor Bay to do this, but I think the large tin box is more a burden than a treasure. It is numbered, however, which is nice. Overall, this is a good set to have for fans of Barker's vivid imagination.",980726400,2,2322,4.987113402061856
1111228,5,6305972028,"out of the 1980s, the two BIGGEST horror films were ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" in 1984 and ""Hellraiser"" in 1987. With ""Nightmare"", Wes Craven took us into the world of dreams. With ""Hellraiser"" 1&2, Clive Barker took us straight into HELL. ""Hellraiser"" 1&2 could be viewed as one movie since they tie in so closely, so when i say ""Hellraiser"", i'm actually referring to both films. with the first film, clive barker gave us a story of family affairs and with it threw in demons from hell to punish certain individuals. he also brought us one of horror's biggest icons in ""pinhead"". right up there with ""freddy"", ""jason"", and ""michael myers"", ""pinhead"" has been established as a true horror icon. even though it may be a bit of an uneven movie, ""Hellraiser"" rose above the typical teenage slasher flick to bring out a TRUE HORROR film that doesn't insult one's intelligence. the second film basically picks up right where the original left off with the lead protagonist having to take a trip to HELL itself in order to rescue someone. neither of these films are reccommended for the weak of stomach nor the faint of heart. if you've NEVER seen a horror movie in your life, ""Hellraiser"" is a good start. After watching these two movies will make other horror films seem not so good after you've seen Clive Barker's vision of HELL. ""Hellraiser"" is a true horror masterpiece and shouldn't be overlooked at all...if you love horror. the body count may not be to the height of a ""Friday the 13th"" but that's not what these films are about at all. these movies aren't about ""boo""-type scares that startle you or make you jump. no, what ""Hellraiser"" does is it disturbs you greatly with a sense of somewhat artistic beauty along the way. so it won't make you jump or scream, but it will make you somewhat queasy and will stick in your mind with certain disturbing images. that's what makes it a benchmark in horror.  it may not be a pleasant place at all but it's one you'll dare to revisit- just never alone. on the DVD side of things. i wouldn't exactly call it a full-blown special edition but it's probably the most ""special"" special edition we'll see. the tin's nice and all, with the mini-posters, but someone could've done a better packaging job than this. just a cd case with both DVDs is the indication of laziness on anchor bay's part. the commentary tracks are nice as are the rest of the disc content. the picture has never been clearer and neither has the sound. a MUST-HAVE for any horror fan or especially ""Hellraiser"" fan.",977356800,4,2529,4.632516703786192
1111229,4,6305972028,"I must say that irregardless of future attempts to revive this series, only two of them wholly stand out.  Of these, the original Hellraiser comes second.  With the release of this limited tin, we get a few goodies, decent sound, excellent picture quality, and a very original screenplay.  Yet, it does lose a little towards the end.  One must remember, though, that this movie was made in the middle 80's, and truly pioneered some of the shock horror we have become accomodated to today.  Hellraiser 2 picks up where the first lets off, and the first 30 minutes are truly awesome.  The story is filled with moments that can lead us to a truly scary movie.  But after that first 30 minutes is up, the movie goes to hell, both literally and storywise.  I would recommend buying this tin if you want the extras both discs offer, but if that does not interest you, buy the first and Bloodline, then rent the rest and laugh.",973468800,3,920,4.533333333333333

But I'm a little bit disappointed by the technally realisation of this DVD. Both Movies are presented in there theatrical ratio of 1.85:1 and in full frame. ""Hellbound"" ist in the widescreen mode exactly the same as in the full frame presentation, but matted with black bars. ""Hellraiser"" appears to be the 1.66:1 version also matted with black bars to show the 1.85:1 format. Compared to Anchor Bays ""Halloween"" Box, this is a leap back in the production of exclusive DVDs.
Never the less, ""Hellraiser"" is always worth buying and if it was just for the bonus material like the commentary of Clive Barker, Peter Atkins, Ashley Lawrence etc. The Movies are still great classics and a creepy way to enjoy an gloomy autum's evening.

I WANT TO GET MY HANDS ON DIRECTOR'S  CUTS!
But the problem with this Hellraiser release is that it might be  the same lousy version they put in the limited LaserDisc Box which I bought  for over $100 years ago. Will they ever learn? Who wants such highly CUT  versions of the best horror movies of all times? I can't believe that  people give this release 5 stars. Does anybody ever heard Clive Barker's  Commentary? He comments on every scene the MPAA forced him to cut out of  the movie. Why can't we get an UNRATED release with all  scenes?
Hellraiser 2 will hopefully be UNCUT but it won't be the  Director's Cut which was released on LaserDisc a few years ago.
Be very  carefull with this release...
Don't get me wrong. I would give 6 stars  not if it would be possible but if AnchorBay would release the correct  versions of the movies.
