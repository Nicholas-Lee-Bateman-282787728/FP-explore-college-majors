8187338,4,B000OYC78K,Old black and white horror classics. Carnival Of Souls is a good movie.,1435968000,,71,4.538461538461538
8187339,2,B000OYC78K,"Revenge of the Zombies is presented in a matted (non-anamorphic) transfer.  You ever heard of a widescreen film from 1943?  Transfer for this Mantan Moreland gem is pretty bad, too.  The Terror actually looks better than my other copy.  This one was filmed in 1:85:1 , course you get a pan and scan full screen here.  (scratching head)  Stick with Criterion if you're considering this disc for Carnival of Souls.  Bonus CD is one of those scary sounds Halloween type records, newly recorded and more annoying than scary.  There you have it.  If you need a copy of The Terror you could do worse, but you're better off with a gray market copy of Revenge and a Criterion Carnival.",1254009600,7,677,4.621848739495798
