6444551,5,B00KRGYDX2,I loved this movie. I originally purchased the digital copy just to show support for my friend won't is the lead character James Hollis III. After watching the movie I liked it so much that now I watch it every time I am in the mood for humor and suspense. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and is looking for a movie that keeps you entertained the entire time.,1411516800,,390,4.213333333333333
6444552,5,B00KRGYDX2,"I'm a fan of independent film, and was lucky enough to attend the premiere of this movie shown under its original title, ""The Death Together."" With a budget smaller than most studio producers' average weekend coke layout, it is pretty damn flooring how high the production value is on this flick and how standout the performances by the actors were. There are some debut performances here that are going to lead to some serious careers here; James Hollis III carries this film with more range and humor than Bruce Cambell brought to the table on the original Evil Dead, and his ability to be likeable while getting into some seriously heavy emotional territory reminded me of the caliber of Jason Lee's performance in Mallrats. Simply a great movie-fantastic writing, more laughs than any big budget comedy in the last ten years with the possible exception of This Is The End, seriously hot actresses, the funniest cat death bit in any movie to date, and a classic ending. Can't wait for the sequel. Easiest five star rating I've ever given a film. Probably seven stars by comparison to most flicks I've seen in the theater lately. Don't miss this one.",1411344000,2,1152,4.793969849246231

8660967,3,B00KRGYDX2,"I wanted to like it. But the main character's acting was so horrible that it wasn't funny. I normally adore these types of movies for wee hours watching. But this one I found myself fast forwarding through the last half hour because I'd lost interest. Too bad we can't give half stars for a rating because this would really be a 2.5. I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either.",1470528000,,380,4.291666666666667
8660968,4,B00KRGYDX2,"If you like the offbeat, give it a try. It's a bit film school-y for 5 stars but genuinely funny in a kookie way. I could have done without the gross-outs; not needed, just icky. There some real intelligence in the script, with millennials turning the humor on themselves. Carefully observed, self-deprecating, endearing. The acting was very good, in my  opinion, esp. James Hollis, but really, all of them.",1470182400,,407,4.898550724637682
8660969,4,B00KRGYDX2,"Though low-budget, this is quite far afield from the ""home movies"" Amazon Prime brings to its groaning audience by the hundreds. The dialogue is clever and often hilarious, and flows easily from (most of) the actors. The lead character is actually a pretty decent actor great for the role, and while a low-budget feature, the people working on this hidden gem have done an excellent job. It shows some real promise throughout, and was surprisingly worth the view.",1469664000,2,463,4.948717948717949
