8452762,5,B000JJ4WIS,"I bought Speed Grapher when it first came out, and got the Limited Edition first volume with the collector's box. Because of that, I ended up buying all the volumes separately to complete my set rather than buying any of the complete sets (Viridian Collection, S.A.V.E.). I'm glad I was forced to buy them this way, though. The art on each box is beautiful, and I love the collector's cards and booklets that come in them. Definitely worth the money if you're a collector.

This series is AMAZING. Definitely one of my favourite animes of all time. It's not only beautifully drawn (the character designs and art style really make this one stand out), but the writing is phenomenal. The show is very dark (with some lighter moments here and there), and the depth of the storyline will blow you away by the end of the series. It includes action, adult, and political issues throughout the entire series, and very tastefully done. I make sure to always recommend this one to people. I'm still blown away by how few people have actually seen this series. I think most people would like this whether they like anime or not.

It's too bad this series was done when fullscreen was just barely starting to phase out. The only thing that could possibly make this show better is if it had been done in Widescreen HD.",1374537600,,1306,4.600858369098712
