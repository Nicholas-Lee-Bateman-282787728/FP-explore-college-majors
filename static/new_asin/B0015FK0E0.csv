8258313,1,B0015FK0E0,"I was looking for a DVD that would teach the dances in a simple way. I found this DVD to have a lot of wordy ""preaching"" that I don't believe has a place in the video. Also, all the dancer's clothes were very long and their feet could not be seen. Feet must be seen so you can see what the dancers are doing and learn the steps. I also didn't find that the women had very crisp steps, again so you could discern what they were doing. if you're looking for a DVD where you can just watch and worship, then this is it. if you are looking for an instructional DVD, then this isn't it. I am disappointed.",1369526400,,600,4.008333333333334
