8513447,4,B007AMHQVM,"I know I will never be a professional movie critic because apparently my taste in movies has not been whetted to a fine enough edge.  I like this movie. I thought the cast, including Stuart Granger were very good with their roles. The story was believable and the characters genuine and importantly, it was an interesting story..
Now for the caveat, This is a Region 2 PAL DVD. Unless you have a region free DVD player, you won't be able to enjoy this movie at all. I bought a Samsung Region Free, Up-converting DVD player last year and it paid for itself with this movie which was an excellent copy.  If you are a Granger fan, and have the means to watch this DVD, I recommend you get it.",1384300800,3,689,4.333333333333333

8513449,2,B007AMHQVM,"There's a better film lurking in the material than ever makes it to the screen in Harry Black and the Tiger, another 50s CinemaScope shot-on-location effort which sees Stewart Granger's tin-legged hunter tracking a man-eating tiger and finding his path crossing with Anthony Steel's coward and his wife - and Granger's unconsummated love - Barbara Rush, yet it's so restrained and there's so little spark between the leads that it never catches fire the way it should. Indeed, only I.S. Johar's guide makes much of an impression. There are some interesting ideas, not least the way Granger's progress is linked to the tiger, visually, physically and emotionally, but unfortunately the execution is often a bit dreary without ever quite tilting over into total boredom. Watchable, but it rarely repays the effort.

Fox's Spanish PAL DVD boasts a fine transfer in its original CinemaScope ratio.",1332806400,,893,5.201388888888889
8513450,4,B007AMHQVM,"Hired by the British home office to hunt down and kill a man eating tiger that has been raiding villages in an Indian province, Harry Black (Stewart Granger) must not only contend with his failing courage but the reappearance of a wartime friend (Anthony Steel) and his wife (Barbara Rush) who he fell in love with while Steel was a prisoner in a POW camp in Germany. Directed by Hugo Fregonese and based on the novel HARRY BLACK by David Walker, the film is about courage and fear in their various forms. Granger's fear of the tiger, Steel's fear of escape from the POW camp (which causes Harry to lose his leg) and Rush's fear of leaving her husband for Granger and even the tiger's own fear of death. Granted, the tiger is a man eater and must be destroyed but he's such a beautiful creature and one develops a perverse sympathy for him, wounded and struggling to survive in the jungle as the vultures hover over him ... waiting. Granger, never the most stimulating of actors, is quite good here in possibly his best performance. The authentic India locations give the film an atmospheric feel. John Wilcox (EXPRESSO BONGO) is responsible for the CinemaScope lensing and Clifton Parker the score (his scoring for the goodbye in the rain is particularly lovely). With I.S. Johar (DEATH ON THE NILE) in a BAFTA nominated performance and Kamala Devi (soon to be Mrs. Chuck Connors).

The Spanish DVD courtesy of Fox is a decent anamorphic transfer in its original CinemaScope ratio (2.35).",1296432000,4,1489,4.726923076923077
