2141023,2,B0002Y4SXO,"The PBS program was mildly engaging as I remember. It gave a lot of interesting insights into the lives and times of both Lewis and Freud. Still, it left much to be desired in the way of real advancement or meaningful discussion about the existence of God and belief. The panel of ""experts"" are far from expert in their comments, which are more random and opinionated, rather than meaningful or insightful. As a student of philosophy of religion, there is no more frustrating thing than to see an opportunity for fruitful discussion get wasted by people who don't have a clue about what they're discussing. Perhaps a panel of honest thinkers, instead of talking heads, would make for a more interesting program in the future.",1121299200,22,725,4.808
2141024,5,B0002Y4SXO,"This PBS presentation beautifully lays out contrasting views (theism/atheism)... yet somehow never comes off as advocating either one; letting the viewer decide.  As much as I love Freud and also warm up to such deep-thinkers as C.S. Lewis... it was the periodic ""roundtable"" discussion sessions moderated by Dr. Armand Nicholi that blew me away.  I found myself pausing this DVD over and over again as I wrote down my own thoughts and, yes, my own spontaneous revelations.  It's that sort of program.  It makes you want to grab a notebook and a pencil.

I won't tell you which way I lean (Freud? Lewis?)... but I will say BUY THIS!  SEE IT!  It is quite possibly one of the only sources giving equal time to both sides of this age-old issue.  If nothing else, you'll be fascinated at the eruption of thoughts/realizations that you-the viewer will most-certainly experience.",1100736000,97,874,4.8979591836734695
2141025,5,B0002Y4SXO,"I saw bits and pieces of this show when it aired on PBS.  As an atheist I'm glad to see that this topic, with equal time for both sides (theist and atheist), is being presented.  Possibly only a decade ago this type of subject matter would not have aired on public television, especially with the viewpoints of a nonbeliever being showcased unedited.  I was very impressed with the representatives that PBS chose for intermediate board-meeting-style debates.  Michael Shermer, editor of Skeptical Inquirer Magazine is one of the skilled persons chosen to represent a nonbeliever's point-of-view.

Between PBS's efforts to host controversial topics with fairness and the efforts of Penn & Teller, with their new show ""BullSh*t"", supernaturalism is finally experiencing scientific scrutiny in the public eye.",1096848000,21,806,5.365079365079365
2141026,5,B0002Y4SXO,"I watched this on PBS the past two weeks.  It's 4 hours total, and shows the personal history of these two men (complete with some well done reenactment) and how they came to their beliefs interspersed with a panel of people with different beliefs (believers and nonbelievers) talking about a lot of the basic issues with religion and Christianity.  The panel includes a Dr. from Harvard, the editor of Skeptic magazine, and some other really interesting people.

As is to be expected (hey, it's PBS :)  The Question of God is very well done.  Extremely fascinating, and it makes you think. I was so impressed by it that I'm seriously considering buying it.  I'm also going to read C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity.",1095897600,72,712,4.795081967213115

2141052,5,B0002Y4SXO,"I initially saw this production by chance while taking a University course. The program is so influential I immediately sought a personal copy to review and take time to bring all aspects of this work into perspective.
I will say that it is one of the best ever made. The train of thought, based on a course of instruction, links a discussion panel that ranges from Atheism to Believer and includes acted scenes of both Sigmund Freud and C.S. Lewis, comparing their lives where one remained an Atheist and the other changed his view from Atheist to Believer during roughly the same period of life and experiencing the same situations of world events. It has a great musical score produced by Milan Kymlicka and the discussion panel will have you attentive to the back and forth views of each one of them. Michael Shermer dominates the panel with his skepticism but it is all very informative and entertaining.",1323216000,,909,4.7594936708860756

2141054,5,B0002Y4SXO,"This video gave an excellent view of the countering views on God of Freud and C.S. Lewis. But it also contained interesting information about the lives of those two men.

It is also interesting to watch ""educated"" people talking about the existence of God.",1278979200,2,334,4.775862068965517
2141055,5,B0002Y4SXO,"Excellent video and a great tool for thought provoking philosophical discussion either in a bible study group or with non-believers.
I would highly recommend it to those who want to either know more about the lives of C.S. Lewis or Sigmund Freud or are possibly looking for answers to questions they have about God and his existence.",1228694400,,333,4.859649122807017
2141056,2,B0002Y4SXO,"In both the book and DVD version, Nicholi presents himself as neutral on the question of the existence or nonexistence of God.  In fact, Nicholi is a founding board member of powerful conservative Christian lobbyist group the Family Research Council, which actively attempts to outlaw homosexual and abortion rights while advocating abstinence-only sex education and the theory of Intelligent Design.  While I assume Nicholi has the best intentions, his strong bias comes through in every aspect of the work, and in the end this feels like an unfairly hidden conflict of interest.

By pitting unhappy and mean-spirited Freud against joyous Lewis, Nicholi seems to imply that all Christians are happy and all atheists are grumpy.  Obviously, it would be just as easy to focus on a happy atheist and grumpy Christian, so this argument is groundless.  However, because the argument is forwarded consistently yet implicitly, it is difficult to easily identify and refute.  Just listen to the typically disjointed and melancholic music used in the Freud scenes compared to the happy or profound music selected for Lewis.

Nicholi frames the God question as: ""We make one of two basic assumptions: we view the universe as an accident, or we assume an intelligence beyond the universe who gives the universe order, and for some of us, meaning to life.""  This framing of the question is unambiguously borrowed from the Intelligent Design movement Nicholi is part of, and rests on an implicit assumption not 1 atheist in 1,000 would agree with: that the only alternative to God is Accident.  In fact, as soon as Nicholi finishes framing the question, skeptic Louis Massiah gently corrects him: ""To me there is an order to the way things are, and the central question is whether you want to say that the 'orderer' is God.""

The above is not an isolated example; throughout the work, Nicholi's method, particularly in his framing of questions and frequent use of specious but masked assumptions, is heavily weighted in favor of his hidden bias.  Nicholi's course addresses one of the most fascinating of all questions, and was engaging to read and watch.  However, I feel he has some moral obligation to be forthcoming about having co-founded a group actively pushing Intelligent Design in Washington, and to resist his frequent reliance on rhetorical sleight-of-hand.",1212796800,25,2357,5.12532637075718
2141077,3,B0002Y4SXO,"The PBS home video, The Question of God based off of Dr. Nicholi's book compares the lives of Sigmund Freud and C.S. Lewis.  While the book was exceptional, the DVD is mediocre.  The DVD features a comparison of the lives of these two greats with a narration and actors depicting Lewis and Freud.  The quality is excellent, but, it lacks the depth of the book.

The other part of the DVD is the round table discussion, and here it utterly fails.  There is really one person, Michael Shermer, who is impressive in answering the questions offered by Nicholi.  On the religious side, most of the ""religious people"" (from Buddhism to Christianity) fail to really answers agnostic and atheists objections beside ""it is faith"" or ""many types of evidence.""  While there may some truth to this, they fail in their presentation and in providing larger, stronger arguments.  One wonders if anyone on the panel really ever read Lewis at all?  The other ""non-believers"" raised the typical straw men objections and other silly statements (the attorney is absolutely, horrible, I hope he doesn't use his own criteria when evaluating a case).  Shermer, while I think he is often wrong, does a very good job (as always, Shermer is always likable and presents his points well). There are good answers to his statements, but no one on this panel presented any.

I am surprised by the many five stars. Maybe I am missing something, but I really think this is average, no better, no worse.",1202256000,16,1469,4.7896825396825395
2141078,5,B0002Y4SXO,"Whether theist or atheist most people gravitate toward resources that offer evidence for their preconceived opinions.  This series doesn't do that.  At times the persuasion of C. S. Lewis is so strong that the DVD feels like the sort of evangelical piece that should be shown in churches.  At these moments one wonders if it would be banned in our public school system.  At other times the logic of Sigmund Freud pulls just as strongly towards atheism.  At these moments one wonders if the entire series would be banned from many churches.  To add further dimension to the discussion Dr. Armand Nicholi created a panel of seven intelligent persons to wrestle with the question of God.  Three of these are theists and three are atheists.  Dr. Nicholi fills the seventh chair as a moderator.  He takes great pains to be unbiased while making sure the discussion stays on track.  After viewing this series one may have all sorts of ideas, but one will not be able to honestly label either side as ""backward"" or ""less intelligent"".

As a college philosophy instructor I particularly like the format of the discussion.  While not using philosophical jargon the series starts with a section on Epistemology (theories of knowledge) by pitting the scientific world view against the spiritual world view.  From here the series naturally leans toward Metaphysics (the big picture questions, God, cosmos, ontology, etc.).  The series next follows a logical progression into Ethics with discussions on morality.  Finally there is a perfect wrap up section on pain and dying.

The DVD contains a study guide that works well with each section.  There are nine sections, but some may be coupled to complete the series in fewer sessions.  I originally intended to skip a few sections but quickly discovered that doing so created a bias toward or against religious belief.  While I personally don't have a problem with such a bias, everyone has a bias on this subject, creating the bias destroys the intent of the entire series and reduces the work to a propaganda piece.  This is easy to do.",1193356800,5,2075,4.908045977011494
2141079,5,B0002Y4SXO,"I considered myself an agnostic for years. In presented two points of view from two of the most intelligent men of the 20 century, this book guides you through much self-examination. In reading and considering each perspective argument, I found myself landing consistently on one side of the fence. With the help of the author, I've now throughly examined my own perspective on this very important question and have come to my own unequivocal conclusion. I no longer waver, and feel completely comfortable with my belief system. I believe it will help you do the same.",1174608000,6,568,4.927083333333333
2141080,5,B0002Y4SXO,"It's really great to get both sides of the argument in one unbiased presentation.  I myself am an atheist.  Most reviews seem to be attacking the weakness and cynicism of Freud's arguments.  However, truth be told, it really wouldn't matter how good an argument an atheist presents, nothing can dim the sweet promise of life continuing after death for religious people.  Even though humans share roughly the same body design of all terrestrial vertebrates, even though we give birth to and feed our young in the exact same way as most placental mammals, even though most of our senses are actually far inferior to most other creatures, and even though we share 96+% of our DNA with chimpanzees, it just can't be that OUR deaths are the end of our existence.  Death being the end of things for a chimp is fine, but I suppose we believe if we're intelligent enough to contemplate such a thing as an afterlife, then we should be entitled to some kind of cosmic compensation, even though no convincing evidence of such a thing has ever been produced.  If there's an omnipotent god who created us, why did he screw up so much?  Why are so many people suffering from near/far sightedness, and with debilitating diseases like diabetes and Parkinson's Syndrome?  What was god thinking when he decided to give us an appendix? Why exactly are earthquakes, tornadoes, and tsunamis an inescapable necessity in god's perfectly created Earth?  When god said, 'let there be light', why didn't he also say, 'except for deadly, cancer causing UV rays, because my people will have enough to deal with, what with all the earthquakes, tornadoes, tsunamis and such'?

What you believe or don't believe won't change what happens to you after death, so I suppose this argument is a rather pointless one.  However, choosing the manner in which you live based on what you think will happen after death is of major significance.  This Docu takes great strides in presenting both sides of these completely incompatible worldviews.",1167350400,3,2003,4.876106194690266
2141081,4,B0002Y4SXO,"I watched this program on PBS's website for free. This was a very good program on the diametrically opposed views of the existence of God. Although it was done in the typical PBS fashion. That is to say, it leaves you to draw your own conclusion (the politically correct way for you ""free thinker"" types). Sniff, sniff, do I smell hints of secular higher education here?

 My own view after watching this program is, overall, Frued's arguments are rather lame, full of self-created psycobable hocus-pocus mumbo-jumbo nonsense and just plain leaves a lot to be desired. He simply doesn't have a leg to stand on. Freud belittles religion at every step in this documentary (remember that organized religion has pre-dated Freud by more than 4,000+ years so it has easily withstood the test of time). So it cannot be dismissed by Freud so easily. Also remember that Freud basically invented all his own theories himself. I emphasize the word ""theories"" here. All within the time frame of his own short life span.

 C.S. Lewis's argument that the mere fact that humans have a conscious and the moral law is found within everybody's own ""heart"" causing them to behaive in a certain way, transeding time, history and cultural experiences is, as far as I'm concerned, sound. Proving, of course, the existence of God. Of course, Freuds argument here is that that the moral law is itself found within time, history and cultural experiences is pretty much nonsense. Many societies in history never even knew of the existence of the other society, yet they all seem to develop the same basic moral law framework to one degree or another. If Freud is correct, then how did a moral law leap from pre-history to history? Have you ever noticed that in even the earliest of civilizations there is at least some basic modicum of moral behaivor? As stated in this program by one of the scholar interviews;  ""... I've never known a society in civilizations history in which lying, cheating, stealing, rape and murder are considered to be a virtue and that truth, honesty, love, charity and humility are considered to be a vice"".

 Freuds dismissal of religion as being ""...a kind of childhood fantasy"" is basically a sorry excuse for a miserable cop-out that it is. And that the wish for a God is a kind of ""neurosis"" that we as humans all inherently possess, is utterly and deeply flawed.

 Is it a neurosis that Freud derived great pride and pleasure from his own family? How about the love and compassion towards his own children? Was that a neurosis?

 I'm always amazed (and amused) at just how easily most ""higher thinkers and scholars"" will sell out themselves, just for status and secure position within their various fields. In this program, we see a good example of this. Both Freud and Lewis did it. Fortunately for C.S. Lewis, he came to his senses and began to see the error of his ways. And ultimately, redemption.

 In the end, Sigmund Freud turned into a rather bitter, crotchety, obstinate, defiant and self-centered old man. C.S. Lewis, on the other hand, turned into a kind, warm, modest, humble, compassionate and selfless old man. Which do you wish to become? Which do you prefer to associate yourself with? (also; is there any coincodence to why just about every still image I see of Freud he is frowning and looks geniunely unhappy and tense and just about every still image of Lewis I see he is smiling, looks geniunely happy and relaxed?). I think not.

 One other thing I feel worth pointing out. It seems that all throughout history, that the typical ""free thinking atheistic/agnostic scholar types"" alway seem to suffer some kind of extremely debilitating problem or disease right near the ends of their pathetic, miserable lives. Freud did and so did Nietsche, just to name two. (Nietsche went insane at the end of his life).

 On the other hand, C.S. Lewis did not. In fact, he lapsed into a coma (as did his wife!), and then miracoulsly snapped out of it and recovered (they both did!). I found this rather interesting and quit telling. Leave God out of your life, and you'll regret it at one point or another. Accept the fact that God is God, place your trust in him, love him and you don't have anything to worry about.

 Let this be a lesson to all you pseudo-intellectual elitist types.",1158710400,10,4300,4.7399463806970505
2141082,5,B0002Y4SXO,"I expected this video to lean noticeably to either a pro evolution or pro theistic viewpoint. The editors have done an excellent job at presenting both sides fairly. It was very helpful to see the story of Freud and Lewis' childhood and early adulthood. This is an important video for anyone interested in the current debate.

I was especially pleased with the roundtable discussions of a focus group. It is a delight to see unscripted opinions being expressed in a non confrontative format. The panel is also well balanced, with no shills on either side. This has become my favorite Nova presentation and I highly recommend it to just about anyone interested in a well rounded education.",1137283200,34,688,4.880341880341881
2141083,4,B0002Y4SXO,"The documentary ""The Question of God"" looks comparatively at the lives and personal philosophies of Sigmund Freud and Clive Staples Lewis. The viewer is taken to the heart of their philosophies and the many experiences that helped define their lives.

No doubt Freud was passionate about his philosophy, yet much of what he believed he could not live out. He was a sad man, and undoubtedly his philosophy was based on his cynical and dark view of existence itself. C.S. Lewis, on the other had, came to a belief in God by mere happenstance, although later he says that he believes God had been seeking him the entire time. C.S. Lewis embodied his beliefs, and as a result he seemed happier and more content with life than Freud. What is the point of having a philosophy for life that one can't live out? The viewer is left to discern the answer to this question.

It is a question we all have to ask ourselves: do we live out what we believe - does God exist, and if he does what role should that play in our lives, and if he doesn't, then what role should that belief play in our lives? Many people hold on to views that would crumble the minute they are tested by experiences. I think that this documentary shows that a true philosophy for life is one that holds up in reality, experience, and the individual's reality. A must see!",1135555200,16,1333,4.459016393442623
2141084,4,B0002Y4SXO,"C.S. Lewis has always been a hero of mine--even before I knew anything about his personal life.

I'd read his books for years (in fact, I've read MERE CHRISTIANITY several times) but didn't know much about him until I saw the movie SHADOWLANDS with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger in 1993.  What an introduction!  Since then, I've read several biographies, watched the British TV version of SHADOWLANDS, and even attended a stage version.  I've actually started reading his Narnia books as well, looking forward to the big-budget Hollywood version heading to screens in Christmas of '05.

So I watched with much interest this PBS show that compared and contrasted the lives of Lewis and Sigmund Freud.  The best parts for me were watching the recreations of their lives and intercutting their words into a dialogue or argument.  I don't know as much about Freud but I think they did a great job of portraying Lewis and representing what his life and writings meant.

The only part that didn't really work was the roundtable discussions with the professor who taught this study as a class.  A couple of people came off as rather shallow since they were trying to sound deep about something they didn't really believe in the first place.  There were a few interesting moments, but it felt tedious to be cutting away from the biographical segments that were so much more interesting.

Still, definitely worth having and watching.",1127606400,18,1427,4.904166666666667

The DVD successfully intertwines both actors protraying Freud and Lewis and a roundtable discussion of the ideas behind the two men.  I found both aspects of the DVD to be very well done.  The actors did an amazing job playing Freud and Lewis and the discussions were well intentioned and provided some thought-provoking information.

That being said, I did have a hard time with some of the people participating in the discussion.  For the most part, they were well informed and very well educated.  Some though, simply did not have any sort of rationale or basis for their opinion/beliefs (either theistic or atheistic).  Perhaps experts in this field would have suited the debate better and provided a more meaningful discussion.  (i.e. Philosophers, theologans, professors, etc.)

I enjoyed learning about the lives and worldviews of both Sigmund Freud and C.S. Lewis---so much so that I ended up downloading the complete works of Freud onto my Kindle and so much that I hope to buy a documentary SOLELY on C.S. Lewis one day. If you choose to buy this documentary, I HIGHLY suggest that you skip the discussion segments because---somewhat ironically---in the name of not being biased, Armand Nichol, despite being a Christian theologian, clearly had the film editor edit the discussions in such a way that they favored Sigmund Freud and that they favored atheism and other forms of nonbelief over religion.
