7834549,4,6303002811,"This antique adaptation of a minor Dickens classic is notable for its period feel. Filmed in 1934, Hay Petrie as the stage villain Quilp gives a bravura performance with much mugging at the camera and an acrobatic virility as the evil dwarf who holds an old man and his daughter in his evil clutches by funding his reckless gambling knowing that the old man will never be able to repay the debt, the old curiousity shop being the old man's only asset. There have been many adaptations since but none with the raw power of Hay Petrie's performance.",1287446400,,547,4.591836734693878
7834550,4,6303002811,"The first talkie version (as far as I know) of Dickens's ""Old Curosity Shop"" suffers much from its way of moviemaking that seems now irrevocably dated: the backdrop of Quilp's counting house on the Themes River looks exactly painted, and that lovable villain Daniel Quilp is portrayed with very theatrical performance.  However, that is precisely the virtue of the film, which proves that the producers of the film knew of Dickensian world.
The film's story remains faithful to the book, which tells the life of Little Nell and her grandfather, who left their house because of the threat of Quilp, moneylender.  They seek for the place to live, and meets variety of unique Dickensian characaters.  In the meanwhile, Quilp, having grudge against Kit, a boy who once was working for Nell's grandfather, tries to imprison him with a help from a toady lawyer Mr. Sampson Brass and his sister Sally the ""Dragon Lady.""
As I said, many would be amazed (or amused) to see the film's old-fashioned way of making, but this has a reason.  Clearly the producers rely on our knowledge of Dickens and his works -- in other words, we are supposed to have read the book.  The proof is that many episodes of the original book are preserved as they were, as if taken directly from the book published 100 years before.  The half-diapidated counting house of Quilp, with Tom Scott always doing some mischief, is re-created exactly as it was in the famous illustration by Phiz, and so are the entertainers at the fair including not only Codlin and Short, but also Jerry's dogs.  You will see the man and woman walking on stilts on the road, as you have seen them in the original illustration.  That faithfulness is the thing that always surprises (and entertains) us.
Those who haven't read the book would probably find the film's production too old; the fact is, old-fashioned as it is, the film is only an attempt to capture the book's atomosphere.  That is also the reason of Quilp's ridiculously exaggerated acting, which he really does in the book.  Quilp hops, dances, grinds his teeth, and scares his wife Mrs. Quilp and her mother to death when his nose is called flat by them (yes, that famous and joyful scene no Dickensians would forget).  The film's Quilp overacts, simply because the book's Quilp does so.
Non-Dickensians would think that Peter Ustinov's TV-mini series made in 1995 are better, and they have good reason.  But I for one prefer this version (which didn't delete Marchioness), which looks closer to the Dickensian world I come to know through the book.  Remember, the original book itself is fairly old-fashioned and theatrical.",1031443200,5,2635,4.841870824053452
7834551,3,6303002811,"Being an avid fan of both cinema and Charles Dickens I was looking forward to seeing this adaption, one of the few I had not seen. One of the lesser known Dickens film outings, it was made in Britain in 1934 and tells the story of an elderly gambling man and his granddaughter whose lives are effected by the miserly, stunted Mr Quilp. The film is well made and well acted (although Hay Petrie is a terrible ham in his role as Quilp) but is dreadfully dated (infact it looks much older than it is) and never having read the book before was unprepared for the unhappy ending (though I should have guessed knowing Dickens) which left me rather cold (and makes me wonder how the 1970's musical version 'Quilp' turned out?). Still the film is enjoyable to a degree and anyone who loves Dickens and old fashioned melodramas should find something to like about it.",1017619200,,858,4.506410256410256
7834552,5,6303002811,"This was supposedly shot in 1935, but it has the ancient lookof a silent film. Certainly the entire cast trots out silent-filmacting conventions, particularly in the case of arch-villain Quilp, whose over-the-top-and-beyond performance has to be seen to be believed. Reliance on music-hall-era special effects (check out that putty nose!)and creaking painted backdrops add to the amateurish charm. When justice comes at last for Quilp, in the form of a squad of police with bloodhounds, it is signaled by a stagehand banging on the prop wall and yelling ""WOOF WOOF WOOF!"" This same FX genius provides the crying baby in an earlier scene, supplimented by a long shot of a bundle. No budget for a real baby, apparently. Yet the costumes are wonderful, with the exception of Little Nell's patchy gown, and the exterior shots of real locations give one the eerie feeling of watching through a window in time. The historic detail is lovingly presented, especially the world of Victorian street performers on the road. The minor character actors deserve plaudits for strong performances in music-hall style. There were times when I felt as though I was watching a Hogarth drawing come to life. Old Curiosity Shop is Dickens at his worst, so don't expect interior logic or realistic motivation. This is MELODRAMA. Once you accept that, however, you can settle back and enjoy watching what I suspect was a fairly young and impoverished cast tripping over the scenery and declaiming the awful dialogue. Tremendous fun.  END",953942400,2,1514,5.104838709677419
