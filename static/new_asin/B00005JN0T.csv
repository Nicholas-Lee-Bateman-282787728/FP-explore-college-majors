1510147,5,B00005JN0T,"How can ANYONE HONESTLY NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE?  It litterally had everything. Sure, it doesn't really live up to the original book, but this movie is still pretty freakin' good.  I loved Will Smith's one-liners and smart remarks.  One of my favorite lines was ""I'm allergic to bullsh*t"".  I (and the rest of the theater for that matter) was rolling with laughter.  And the villain in this movie came as a suprise to me.

YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT!  I give I Robot a 5 out of 5!",1097539200,3,472,4.235955056179775
1510148,5,B00005JN0T,"Based in a Isaac Asimov novel , this film plays hard with the unavoidable and everyday closer presence , deal and consequences around the Artificial Intelligence will impact the world .
The original clues given using literature device of Hansel and Gretel and the far echoes who remind in more than a simple coincidence aspect with Blade runner , do not diminsh nevertheless the interesting premise and the dazzling and fluid camera work .
Alex Proyas is one of the most intelligent directors in these times . Dark city and the crow prove with precise eloquence his deep concerns about the nightmares future .
All his films are inscribed in a kind of sinister gallery of spectres , a dirty world ruled following the Orwellian signals.
Will Smith at last begins to prove he may be an actor ; and far from those ancient cartoon and stupid roles that almost struggled him .
By far , the most challenging , intriguing and interesting sci fiction movie in this year .",1097452800,,962,4.6647058823529415
1510149,3,B00005JN0T,"...is that it just doesn't have enough characters. With such a cut and dry theme -- machines taking over, etc etc -- it is imperative to maintain a modicum of realism.

While the well-made film offers a delectable blend of CGI and some mild humour along with an unexpected twist, it fails miserably by providing only one hero (and his generic love interest from the lab) who single-handedly saves the day against hordes of robots that crawl out of the woodwork to supposedly take a city under their reins.

Wouldn't a real city call for armies or some such well trained forces into action? The end result here is thus too ludicrous to be enjoyable as Will Smith squishes all the machinery to glory all on his own.

Watchable rental if you're really into science fiction or a major Smith buff, otherwise a fairly immemorable summer flick.",1097280000,3,837,4.680272108843537
1510150,4,B00005JN0T,"This movie isn't a powerful piece of science-fiction and artificial intelligence, but it's definitely something you want to see.

Set in the 2030's, where Robots replace people and animals in menial labor, a troubled detective, Del Spooner (Will Smith) is paranoid that the new generation of robots, the NS-5 models (who will be as many as 20% of the population) will turn on humanity. How and when? He doesn't know.

When the inventor and writer of The Three Laws of Robotics (commonly referred to in Asimovian Robot Sci-Fi) and robotics itself and friend to Spooner is unexplicably killed, the detective thinks that this is the result of a specific Robot, who is comfortable being addressed by the name Sunny, and not his Model Number.

A series of events and action sequences lead up to a wonderful climax and twist in the plot, accompanied by good acting and wonderfully imaginative futuristic sets. Great but short comic relief insues along with wonderful thought provoking lines, such as an interrogation with Sunny, where Spooner says to him, ""You do not dream. Dogs dream. Monkeys dream. People dream. But you, you, do not dream. You are not a living thing. Can a robot compose a symphony? Can a robot turn a blank canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?"" And Sunny calmly replies, ""Can you?""

This movie is great fun. Enjoy!",1096934400,3,1330,4.897777777777778

1510387,4,B00005JN0T,"This movie has very good sci-fi visual tone often and its a live action sci-fi robot world that could be an earlier tale from the Matrix Second Renaissance animes  the best ones.

It took me a while to get to grips with this movie but I found the ambient atmosphere of just the music commentary track with sub-titles, combining with the visuals, worked very well. There is commentary for probably about 3-40% of that, but no dialogue or sound effect track, and it is relatively easy to tune out the single voice if one wants to while taking in rest of movie.

Movie is good visually, cool ambitious conceptual world, and it has a good overall story (which may seem a bit ponderous on first viewing but improves on subsequent viewings). I found the performances of the script abit problematic though as script abit all over the place in what type of movie it is wanting to be, mystery, philo sci-fi, dead pan small talkey & humor, big action flick, Will Smith type swagger and style at the time vehicle i guess, this is all encapsulated by Smiths character Detective Spooner, and its a bit awkward him trying to integrate it all to me but perhaps rather more an acquired taste I do not know.

I couldn't get it to click for me, trying subs firstly as I usually do, no subs, subs no sound, but thankfully I found a music only soundtrack option with reasonably light single commentary option which plays with subs, and that worked significantly in my enjoyment of the films many elements coming together.",1504828800,,1501,4.58955223880597

What I liked was:
1. The movie gives us a great look at what would happen to us if
machines / technology got too smart... if you know what I mean...
2. The action was great!
3. Will Smith's character Detective Spooner was awesome!
4. Michelle Monayhan's character was very well played-out!
5. The robots looked cool (the design and CGI work I mean)!
6. The plot held-up the movie very well!
7. The stunts were well done!

The only little problem I had with the movie is that the movie was a little
too slow at times... but anyway, it was still a great story to tell! Highly recommended!

1511203,4,B00005JN0T,"I'm not sure why this movie did not get better reviews (or was not more of a commercial success), because I found it fun and entertaining (and even somewhat touching at times)...Will Smith is great, as ever, playing a street-wise cop in futuristic Chicago; his dislike of robots is obviously the crux of the story, esp. when a robotics genius he knows personally commits suicide (apparently) and Smith's Detective Spooner smells something rotten in the whole affair.  His quest to find the truth forms the plotline of the story, with an overriding question about whether or not robots are (or really ever can be) safe.  The special effects were pretty darn good, even though this movie came out several years ago (it is 2016 as I write this) and I think the acting is perfectly good (this is not Shakespeare with robots; it is, however, a fairly cerebral action/drama).  This movie is like a soft-core version of The Terminator; same message, different delivery.  Well worth a rental, though I actually purchased it.",1469404800,5,1016,4.8895348837209305

I also won't get into the concepts of the movie. I don't care if it is unlikely that this won't happen in the year 2035. Not many(if any) movies that portray technology in the future are ever accurate.

I saw this movie when it came out in 2004 and I liked it then. I recently showed it to my Technology class to invoke thought on the idea of ""robots taking over."" I would say even 12 years later I still like it. In 2004 I watched it as an action movie with my teenage kids. This time I was watching it with my thoughts focusing more on the robots taking over. Either way it is a movie I could watch several times and not get bored of it. Will Smith does a great job as Detective Spooner. Plenty of action!",1464134400,,885,4.051428571428572

1511797,4,B00005JN0T,"This is a very engaging sci-fi film starring Will Smith. It's a sci-fi, suspense, thriller, action film and keeps you watching the whole way through. Set in a future where robots are made to serve humans, Smith plays a detective solving a murder which he believes was committed by a robot. I won't give any more away.

Both the DVD and the Blu-ray are presented in 2.35:1 ratio widescreen. The DVD looks good but the Blu-ray looks and sounds even better.

The DVD has a few Special Features: a commentary track, a making of featurette, a photo gallery. The Blu-ray has these plus several others, including an alternate ending and deleted scenes, featurettes on the special effects, etc. On the Blu-ray you access the special features using the four coloured buttons on your remote.

The DVD has an insert with chapter numbers/titles. The Blu-ray has no booklet or insert.

I picked up the Blu-ray for $5. While the DVD looked good, I'd recommend the Blu-ray for the improved quality.",1451606400,,983,4.798816568047338

Overall a very good movie, slightly over the top action scenes and you have to suspend your brain to believe a human could fight off so many robots... but then it is Will Smith... and it was in the script so I guess it's possible.

But the message of the movie makes it worth it. Still entertaining every time I watch it and I already know the ending, so that's a good sign it's a good movie. :-)",1424563200,,621,4.12396694214876

1512635,1,B00005JN0T,"The characterization of Dr. Susan Calvin in this movie who was Assimov's critical character in many of his Robot stories, is shameful. She was more of a stereotyped maiden in distress in this movie. This had nothing to do with the actor, and probably not the director, but the screen writers. In an age where we have wondered how to characterize smart woman on the forefront of knowledge, we are left with this sham. I have read all of the Robot stories and Susan Calvin in this movie is unrecognizable. This is particularly shameful because Assimov wrote these stories in the 1950's +, at a time when woman were largely relegated to kitchen, cleaning and baby rearing duties.
In addition  to that irksome slap in the face, all of the subtleties that the conflict in following the 3 laws represent were glossed over into almost mindless video game actions. This didn't have to be as many Philip K. Dick movie translations have managed to explore at least some of his philosophy while remaining edge of the seat suspenseful. Finally the only real threat exposed in this movie is  the ""random evil mind  takeover plotline"". Assimov mae it clear that the greatest threat was that Robots would do everything for us and thus render us indolent and unthinking, much like the screen writers for this spit in the face to Assimov's legacy.",1423958400,4,1330,4.748917748917749

1512708,2,B00005JN0T,"I finally broke down and watched I, Robot, which I had hesitated to do when first released.  The trailers prior to its release and the mixed reviews afterwards left me skeptical that any justice would be done to the original book.  I was right and should have stuck with my gut feeling and avoided this mess.  I was going to give this laughable excuse for Isaac Asimov's I, Robot 1 star, but I did like the cat.  In fact I thought the cat gave one of the better performances in the film.  Aside from the title, endless references to the 3 Laws of Robotics and the names of some of the characters this has absolutely nothing to do with the the Good Doctor's original work.  This is just another tired old actioner/shoot em-up/car chase that Hollywood cranks out with mind-numbing regularity.  The performances are wooden. The script makes little sense.  Despite a huge budget, the CGI was uninspired and the cookie-cutter uniformity the film's robots further detracts from the original stories.  Asimov envisioned his robots as simply machines.  Each model uniquely designed for a specific set of tasks.  The Three Laws were the fail safe that prevented robots from harming humans. The conflicts that arose in the stories were between humans and robots as they wrestled with the constraints of  Three laws.  The Laws themselves were brilliant literary device that prevented the stories from descending into just more pulp nonsense of mad scientists building robots to conquer the world.  Sadly, all this was missed. Asimov's insights into to both the human and the machine condition along with his wry sense of humor are never realized.  Alex Proyas's clunky direction comes across as annoyingly flat and shows little appreciation for either the original material or the genre itself.  Even the collective acting chops of Will Smith, Bruce Greenwood, Bridget Moynahan and James Cromwell do little to elevate the movie beyond tedium.  Sadly, there was an opportunity here to make a film that had the potential to become a classic; to explore important moral, sociological and philosophical questions.  Instead the producers decided to fore go any intellectual depth and settle for the usual regurgitated pap that won't tax the audience. Read the book and give this movie a wide berth.",1423008000,2,2282,4.992063492063492
1512709,3,B00005JN0T,"'I, Robot' is a guilty pleasure, not terrible but definitely not outstanding. The future depicted in the film is interesting, and offers some neat ideas, but the film is bogged down by over-the-top action and an over-the-top protagonist.

The setting, a 2035 Chicago where robots are commonplace and the world's largest robotics manufacturer is on the eve of rolling out its newest line of droids, is definitely memorable, although little attention is given to the social implications of robots being commonplace. Robots are shown delivering packages, cooking dinners, and... not much else. Don't ask how they've affected the economy or how many people they've put out of jobs. They actually spend more time on the implications of the seemingly trivial detail of replacing cylindrical tires with spheres - now you can drive sideways!

Will Smith is playing a rough-around-edges cop, similar to his role in Men in Black, but this straight-out-of-the-ghetto character doesn't work well when sitting at his detective's desk in the Chicago PD, or insulting billionaire executives during a routine investigation. You'll often find yourself wondering how his character has a job at all, much less as a keeper of the peace.

The true standout character is ironically the least real. Sonny, a robot with a much more advanced and human AI than his companions, consistently steals the show despite being entirely CG. His face was very well-designed to convey the necessary emotions and evoke empathy from the viewer, and Alan Tudyk really nails the performance. I am tempted to give a 4th star just for Sonny's sake.

'I, Robot' offers some cool action, but it is obvious the creators wanted to squeeze in as much action as possible and some of the scenes feel over-the-top and forced. Frequent comments on the protagonist's bad luck aren't sufficient to lampshade the occasional silliness here. Sure, Will Smith pulling dual pistols out of his jacket and busting a twin-headshot on a robot while *jumping his motorcycle through the air* looks cool, but it's *completely ridiculous*.

There are a lot of visual effects, and although the CG is a bit dated looking it's not terribly distracting. Some effects do look downright cool.

Fans of Asimov's works will note the film has a very tenuous connection with the original literature; Asimov's 3 Laws of Robotics are clumsily jammed into the plot, but the story otherwise is related to Asimov's work in name only. If you pretend the film has some other title, you will be less offended by the faux-tie-in.

I've given the film a hard time, but I honestly enjoy it enough to watch it from time to time. You can buy it for not much more than the cost of renting it, so it's hard to argue with the price.",1423008000,2,2740,4.943478260869565

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Set in Chicago in the year 2035, 'I, ROBOT' introduces a futuristic utopia where harmless, humanoid robots are commonplace in every home and on every street corner. While most Americans are caught up in the convenience of their new 21st century labour force, Detective Del Spooner [Will Smith] has a troubled past with the machines. When he's assigned to investigate the murder of a brilliant doctor [James Cromwell], he finds himself face to face with the robot Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk) accused of the murder. Unlike the soulless legions of labour-robots in the general populace, ""Sonny"" seems to have obtained sentience and insists he didn't kill anyone. Forced to come to terms with his own past, Detective Spooner must uncover the secret behind Sonny's sentience and stop a dangerous robotic uprising brewing in the shadows.

Attributed to Isaac Asimov's short story collection of the same name, 'I, ROBOT' is actually a loose adaptation of a 1939 short story by Eando Binder. Asimov's infamous ""Three Laws of Robotics"" are used as a central component of the plot, but otherwise the film works hard to divorce itself from Isaac Asimov's writings. It's a good thing too and director Alex Proyas 'The Crow' and 'Dark City' and floods the film with so much kinetic gunplay and explosive action that Isaac Asimov would still be rolling over in his grave. For the most part, Alex Proyas's production is a lone wolf effort that follows its own path, ideas, and message, while harkening back to many of the themes explored by the director in his previous films.

'I, ROBOT' is a fine piece of filmmaking. When I first watched the film, I was worried it would just be another Will Smith summer blockbuster attempt. Thankfully, Alex Proyas delves into the story's sci-fi roots with gusto and spends a considerable amount of time questioning the ethics of robotics, the dangers of arrogance, and the reality of class warfare. His vision of the future isn't shaped by special effects, but by ideas. He actually works to develop his characters, rather than slapping them into action scene after action scene as they hurtle toward a predictable ending. The director even manages to throw a whopping sucker punch at the audience with a surprising denouement. Alex Proyas proves, yet again, that he should be on the shortlist of directors best equipped to handle any film that encroaches on the dark fringes of sci-fi and fantasy.

The actors do a great job with the material as well. Alan Tudyk performs miracles with his voice work and helps Sonny emerge as the most endearingly human character on the screen. Beyond Tudyk, Bridget Moynahan, Chi McBride, and Shia LaBeouf pop up to contribute additional layers to the story. They handle their smaller parts in stride and make the most of every scene. Last but not least, Smith delivers a great performance, despite the fact that he relies on his usual screen persona a bit too often. While an uncomfortable abundance of stereotypical one-liners limit the tone of the otherwise heady sci-fi plot, Will Smith grounds the film in reality when it comes time for the robots to attack.

To its detriment, the third act overflows with action, so much so that the story takes a back seat to the scurrying foot soldiers of the robot army. At any given moment, swarms of robots make it seem a bit unlikely that a human detective could outwit and outrun a vast army of machines. It makes for a tense experience, but it also feels hurried and frantic compared to the rest of the film. Consistent pacing is one of those elements that transform a great film into a classic. It may sound strange, but 'I, Robot' is a great film in my opinion.

Alex Proyas is the only director who is the one to give his personal grim visual style and believable characters transcend his source material to provide a compelling film. For all intents and purposes, 'I, Robot' was probably meant to be little more than a summer blockbuster that would generate millions for the studio. Luckily, Alex Proyas injected enough intrigue and thought-provoking questions to push this blockbuster higher than the usual action dreck.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment 'I, Robot' is available in the 3D and 2D version on the All Region Blu-ray disc. Alex Proyas's sci-fi action film arrives on this 3D Blu-ray disc in a beautiful 1080p encoded image and presented in an open matte 1.78:1 aspect ratio. Depth and dimensionality is apparent and can be pretty cool in several sequences, especially during scenes with long hallways, whenever Spooner drives through the freeway tunnel or when the action suddenly moves in slow-motion. Background objects seem to be at great distances, further extending the image, and the final battle against V.I.K.I. has some of the best 3D effects of the entire film. Even with the 3D glasses, the intentional photography with its lightly greyish, somewhat lifeless tone comes through perfectly as contrast is quite vivid and crisp without ruining other aspects of the presentation. Black levels are rich and luxurious with deep penetrating shadows and excellent delineation. The colour palette is bright and bold, particularly the warm, full-bodied primaries. Facial complexions appear natural with exceptionally lifelike textures which reveal every wrinkle, pore and blemish during close-ups. In the 2D format, the video remains the same jaw-dropping quality as the previous high-definition release, except it, too, is presented in the unmated 1.78:1 format. Definition is razor-sharp from beginning to end with outstanding, crystal-clear fine lines on clothing, inside homes and the outside of skyscrapers. One very minor moment at the beginning shows a slight moir effect as the camera slowly pans over the city, but it goes away just as quickly as it is noticed for a brief instant. Little bits of rust spots and scratches on older model robots are plainly visible and distinct while the newer models expose every joint, wire and other miscellaneous parts of metal with extraordinary clarity.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The film comes with a brilliant 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is the identical audio presentation as its high-definition 2D counterpart, delivering a wide and amazingly expansive front soundstage. A wall of sound displays extraordinary channel separation with excellent warmth and fidelity. With crystal-clear clarity and often astonishing room-penetration, dynamic range is precise and extensive; separating the highs from the mids with distinct detailing that never loses focus. The attack and accident scene inside the tunnel terrifically demonstrates how remarkable this high-resolution track is, providing the smallest piece of shrapnel to be heard as clear as the loudest crash without distorting. The low-end is mostly in the mid-bass area, but its packs a deep, impactful punch with a few amusingly thunderous moments that rattle the walls. Amid the chaos and mayhem, vocals are intelligible and well-prioritised. Rear activity is also exceptional and spectacular, continuously providing random sounds, action and some light commotion in the background. Bullets whiz by in the sides and overhead. Glass shatters in all directions and fills the room with debris. Evil robots jump like grasshoppers behind the listener, to the left and right and sometimes directly right in front. Even quiet scenes come with some form of activity in the back, like the distant noise of people arguing, cars driving by in traffic or dogs barking at nothing. Pans and directionality are flawless and convincingly discrete; creating a 360 sound field that's terrifically immersive and ultimately makes the movie a good deal of fun to watch.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: All the following Special Features are only available on the DVD of the film. But the item entitled ""Continue Your 3D Journey"" is ONLY available on the 3D Blu-ray disc.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Alex Proyas and Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman: Director Alex Proyas and Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman sit down for an excellent chat about their vision and intentions for 'I, Robot.' Proyas constantly refers to his ongoing desire to ground the film in reality and he makes sure to point out everything in the film that accomplishes his goal. The two filmmakers go on to discuss the screenplay, changes to the story, content in the film that was inspired by Asimov and other science fiction writers, the cast, the shoot, and the final cut of the film. I was also pleased with Alex Proyas's candid evaluations of his previous films ('The Crow' and 'Dark City') as well as his explanations of the lessons he's learned along the way. I found myself enjoying this commentary far more than the other two and it answered every question I had and didn't grow dull at any point during the film. 'I, Robot' fans should definitely give this one a listen.

Audio Commentary: Commentary on the Legacy and Design Aspect of the film: The driest of the three commentaries also packs in the most participants: screenwriter Jeff Vintar, Production Designer Patrick Tatopoulos, Editor Richard Learoyd, Visual Effects Supervisor John Nelson, Associate Producer John Kilkenny, Digital Domain Animation Supervisor Andrew Jones, and Digital Domain Visual Effects Supervisor Erik Nash. The topics are limited to design and special effects chit chat and I found my eyes glazing over as the boys forgot to clue me into what they were talking about. It's a decent technical track to be sure, but I continually hopped back to the Director's commentary for the best info.

Audio Commentary: Commentary to the Isolated Score by Composer Marco Betrami: I wish soundtracks and scores received more supplemental attention. Composer Marco Beltrami sits down to talk about the melodies, ambient harmonies, and tone of his music. My favourite bits are those in which Marco Beltrami explains how different kinds of music and instrumentation can drastically alter the tone of any given scene. I doubt many people will spend much time here, but this is a unique commentary that should be experienced by anyone looking for something different.

Special Feature: The Making of I, ROBOT' Special [2004] [12:00] This HBO First Look making of documentary which runs for a little over twelve minutes. It's the kind of thing which airs on TV not long before the film's release, so in that regard it's your typical average making of piece. The mix of interviews, clips from the film and outtakes just isn't all that attractive in this kind of package anymore. Contributors to the HBO First Look making of documentary are David Cohen, Bruce Greenwood, Takeo Kanade, Chi McBride, Alex Proyas, Will Smith and Kevin Warwick.

Special Feature: Still Gallery [1080p] Here you get to see 30 still images of an in depth look at the intricate details of the Robots and also other images of behind-the-scenes on the set of the film including some of the Actors and Crew.

Special Feature: Inside Look 2D [1080p] This is an Exclusive Insider's Look at Upcoming Projects from 20th Century Fox. First up is a long Film Trailer for the film Alien vs. Predator.' Next you get a sort of Prom Trailer for Elektra' which gives you clips of behind-the-scene activities and interviews of the film. Then finally you get another Promotional Advert for the DVD Box Set of 24' and also informing you of all the extras you get to view with this box set.

Special Feature: Inside Look 3D [1080p] For the 3D Blu-ray edition, 20th Century Fox offers two very minor and ultimately forgettable high-definition exclusives. In the top right corner of the main menu screen, a small blue banner reads ""Continue Your 3D Journey."" When clicking on it, viewers are given two short preview clips from 'Prometheus' [1:00] and 'The Darkest Hour' [2:00]. Both are presented in 3D with 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtracks and subtitles.

Finally, it's strange giving rave reviews after rave reviews recently, but if the studios keep churning out top-notch product like this, I'm more than happy to continue writing glowing reviews. `I, Robot' 3D proves once again that 20th Century Fox is one of the leading studios currently producing Blu-ray content, both in terms of the quality of their films and the quality of the discs they release. Even though this movie doesn't stay very true to the stories of Isaac Asimov, it's still a great thrill ride, replete with plenty of exciting action, fantastic visuals and special effects, and a very good story. Fortunately, all of this is presented in a spectacular Blu-ray package that rivals anything on the market today. The audio and video qualities are second to none, and the special features are comprehensive and presented in a new, ground-breaking way. I generally don't give out the highest of recommendations unless the movie scores a perfect 10 out of 10 with me, but I'm going to bend that rule on this one. I, ROBOT' 3D Blu-ray can't get any better than this. I have sadly read other reviewers giving a very negative stance on this 3D Blu-ray, well I personally loved it and especially seeing it in stunning 3D and obviously they must have been viewing a totally different film and I cannot hold back and say, this gets a 10 out of 10 ratings in my opinion and it has now gone pride of place in my ever increasing 3D Blu-ray Collections. Highly Recommended!

What this review is really about is Amazon's conduct in the instant-playing of this movie.  We had some issues with it: Silverlight plug-in was problematic, as usual; the internet connection was spotty; buffering was troublesome.  Amazon noted these issues and has refunded me the cost to rent the film.  It was only $2.99, but this gesture says to me that Amazon is not only concerned about the experiences their customers have with their products, but also that they're attempting to monitor their own performance in that regard.  Good on them for that.",1404691200,,678,4.860869565217391

Asmov's interesting robot-intelligence themes insinuate good questions like: what is the definition of life, how would we handle elite intelligence like that, and how would we treat them, and do they really ""feel"" emotions?

I was pretty pleased with Will Smith's performance as Del Spooner, a Chicago Police Detective trying to solve the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the creator of Sonny, a robot with a conscience.

While not following the book, this movie, as a movie, is very entertaining and as such should be enjoyed for that purpose.

He is a little old school compared to rest of society in this movie. A scientist give one robot dreams and teaches it to break the 3 laws. The big brain behind the movie takes over the world thinking they are protecting humans from themselves.

1513540,5,B00005JN0T,"I gotta say I love this movie, Will Smith is so likable as a paranoid cop in the future where robots are a normal part of life & just about everyone has one as if it were a cell phone, except Smith who feels that they are a danger waiting to happen, his paranoia really goes into overdrive when one of the main scientist (James Cromwell) is found dead in the company building after a apparent suiside, Smith of course, knew the scientist & knows somthing isn't right, he then meets with the CEO of the company that designs the robots who is played Bruce Greenwood(Star Trek) about a possible malfunction that could occur with the robots who are supposed to obey 3 laws that says they can't harm humans, Greenwood assures Smith that the 3 laws are intact with every robot but Smith isn't convinced especially when one (Sonny) appears to have gone rogue with some kind of special programming, Bridget Moyahan is the robot specialist who tries to ease Smith's paranoia but has no real impact, after they chase Sonny, he is soon caught & taken in, as Smith says to Moyahan...""rules are made to be broken"" when she even talks about the 3 laws, basically this is a cautionary tale about our dependency on technology, like the ""Terminator"" films, this one clearly shows how artificial life could see itself as being far more superior if we are not careful, although this may be science fiction, scientist have said this could be our reality in about 50 to 60 years & Smith definately gives us reasons to be paranoid about technology run amok, but it is Smith's charm that really keeps this one fun to watch, especially his one-liners when he is attacked by robots in a tunnel, we identify with his paranoia, & Bridget Moyahan is sweet to look at & Sonny is a robot you just can't help but like especially when we learn his real purpose, by far Will Smith's best film.",1395446400,,1860,4.5222551928783385

1513692,5,B00005JN0T,"I'm sure we all know a movie made from a book we loved that didn't tell the story in quite the way the book did. This is surely one of those cases. Still, that being said, this is a very good telling. Will Smith is great as Det. Del Spooner who just doesn't trust robots and is sure that he's after one that isn't bound by Assimov's well known Three Laws of Robotics that prevent a robot from harming human or allowing a human to be harmed through inaction. He's right but has identified the wrong threat as Sonny (Alan Tudyk), a special project in AI of Dr. Alfred Lanham's (James Cromwell) whose murder is the precipitating event for the story.

If you've not read Isaac Assimov's classic this is simply a great movie with lots of action and mystery. If you have, I think you'll agree that this is a very good cinematization of it. I highly reccommend it.",1391212800,,857,4.35625
1513693,4,B00005JN0T,"I have seen Isaac Asimov's I, Robot several times in the past and had an urge to see it again. This time I bought it for my collection. The first thing to know if you have read the book is that the movie takes only the title, Susan Calvin's name and character and one very small incident. And the incident was significantly changed. For everyone else it won't matter.

Having said that, the movie stands as a thoroughly entertaining two hours. Everything makes sense including the possibility or likelihood of it's advanced technology. I think we can expect it. Will Smith is perfect in his role as are the special effects. Everything looks real as do all special effects these days. The story concerns a master computer, Vicki, and a new generation of humanoid robots. They are trying to do good for all. But both do terrible things without, in compliance with the three laws, harming a single human. If you don't know the three laws you will from the movie.

That's as far as I will go so as to leave some surprises for those who haven't seen the movie which I highly recommend.

Why not five stars? Because while it has the viewer consider the good and bad of technology, just think of the industrial robots replacing human workers, it isn't quite deep enough for my taste. Brave New Word, 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 among many others did it better. And I'll watch it again, maybe tonight.",1390780800,2,1389,4.570281124497992

I have a new 55"" Samsung HD3DTV with 240Hz Refresh, or Samsung's ClearMotion refresh rate of 720Mhz.  So, the TV is not the issue, especially when I compare with other 3D movies I now own.  The picture is awesome on just about any bluray but unlike my other 3D movies, this one had no visible objects flying out of the screen - there was no ""Wow"" factor at all as far as special effects slapping me in the face.  It did give some depth, though, and so unless you are buying the movie for some spectacular ""oh My God"" remake in 3D (it is an old film, remember), you might just want to pass on the extra bucks just for 3D,  and instead stick to the regular Bluray version.

FYI: It has been several years since I saw the original on DVD to the point where I'd forgotten most of the story-line, so it was great fun again, this time with super sharp images and excellent audio, watching a movie without necessary knowing what happens to the main characters (including the friendly iRobot you will meet at the beginning of the film - so no spoilers there!!).",1389052800,,1214,4.349557522123894

1513867,3,B00005JN0T,"I'm not familiar with the Asimov novel, so I watched I, ROBOT with no preconceived notions.  And it's a well-made film with impressive visuals and super special effects.  Will Smith can play a paranoid, suspicious cop with the best of them, and he provides a solid performance as Detective Del Spooner--a man with an unfortunate past that puts him at odds with mankind's growing dependency on robotic labor.  So when a roboticist (is that even a word?) allegedly jumps to his death at the monolithic company that makes robots, Del immediately suspects foul play and corporate cover-up, yet the only other ""person"" with the scientist before his jump was a robot named Sonny.  And robots can't kill!  That's the first law of robotics!  So Spooner is a loner and against the system as he pursues the various leads availed to him, yet along the way he convinces a robotic programmer (Bridget Moynahan) that something is amiss. . .and that a robotic takeover is underway.  This leads to an over-the-top ending--along with the revelation who the real ""villain"" is--that's as nutty as it is predictable.

This film has plenty of action, and again, the special effects are nothing short of stunning.  The animation of the robots looked a tad forced; in particular, during the action sequences, they looked more cartoonish than robotic.  And the plot is so multi-layered with robotic philosophical shtick it often gets in its own way.  But where I really cringed is when I saw that a very young Shia LaBeouf has a small role as a hotheaded street punk.  Can his fifteen minutes of fame please just go away?  Yet despite all my misgivings, if you're into science fiction and action thrillers I, ROBOT delivers both in a high octane way.  I'm just not looking forward to the day when your toaster can talk back to you.

There are a few instances when shards of glass seem to blow out into the viewers space, but other than that don't expect much 3D effects in front of the screen. I found the 3D on movies like Dredd, Star Trek: Into Darkness, Resident Evil: Retribution, Prometheus, or The Avengers to be much more thrilling to watch. If one has enhancements on their TV to exaggerate the 3D then this helps somewhat but still it doesn't come close to comparing with some of the other films I've mentioned. The aspect ratio on this film is such that it does fill the whole screen so that is a plus. The movie itself is also well done, but if one already has it on blu-ray then one might not find it worth upgrading to 3D.",1381622400,2,984,4.295698924731183

1513999,2,B00005JN0T,"A film with a lot of interesting ideas almost completely buried in over-the-top action sequences, mind-numbingly boring dialogue and surprisingly shoddy-looking special effects, this EXTREMELY loose ""suggestion"" of the stories of Isaac Asimov would have the master rolling in his grave, if he were trite and clichd enough to engage in it. Mostly a mishmash of BLADE RUNNER, A.I. and every antihero cop movie ever made, the film follows Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) on a quest to find the killer of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the genius behind the workforce-dominating humanoid robots that fill up nearly every scene in this clunky CGI/live amalgamation. The film supposedly takes place in Chicago, but there is not one slight reminder of that city until a shot of the river near the very end that's vaguely recognizable. Spooner hates robots and suspects them for some reason from the beginning, but we never get to know him well enough to care; the film spends much more time erotically fascinated by Will Smith's big pecs than it does in creating a cohesive person for him to play.

Of course, robots aren't people; robots can't kill, or so we are told. There are many quick, fleeting references to interesting themes throughout the film such as:
* what does it mean to be human?
* is hating a harmless machine similar to being racist (both Spooner and his long-suffering boss are black, in a world that seems to have nearly, but not quite, forgotten that fact)?
* at one point does a human with replacement parts start to become more machine than man * does it emasculate, or ameliorate humanity to have its menial tasks performed by something man-created?
* can you actually program a machine to think for itself?

etc etc...but they are all subordinated to endless chases and explosions and gun battles. There are no characters of consequence here, and even the seeming possibility of a love story between Spooner and scientist Susan Calvin (based on one of Asimov's most famous characters but unrecognizable apart from the name) goes nowhere. There just isn't time with all the action they have to put in! Not to mention dozens of product placements, and, did I forget to mention, Will Smith's perfect-as-a-robot sculpted body. In fact, given the way the principle actors seem to sleepwalk through this film, the most interesting idea I was left with was a question as to who and what was most robotic in the film; was there, in fact, any human touch to the movie at all?",1380240000,3,2476,4.851063829787234

The plot promotes a fear of technologies that could never be developed by 2035, and would not work like this in any case.  Will Smith's part is an anti-robot bigot (as in the hate and paranoia kind). The lead female was smart and strong at the beginning, but gradually reverted to a dummy who was mostly around to get saved. The Chicago where this takes place bears no resemblance to today's Chicago, so we should perhaps assume that between now and 2035, Chicago will be bulldozed and rebuilt with ugly modern skyscrapers.

Movie: I, Robot: ~~Folks!!! it is 2035~~

Director: Alex Proyas
Producer: Twentieth Century Fox
Based on a sci-fiction story written by: Isaac Asimov with the same name
Cast:
Will Smith - Spooner - A Detective with hi-tech gadgets and a hate for Robots as he thinks they can never be friendly to humankind and can be a threat to their existence anytime.
Bridget Moynahan - Dr. Susan Calvin - A Psychologist and engineer at USR expert in designing Robots
James Cromwell - Dr. Alfred - A Bio Man and vice chairman of USR, who dies in mysterious circumstances right in the be
Bruce Greenwood - Robertson - the CEO of USR, a shrewd man - owner of USR - US Robotics - producing robots that serve the human kind
Alan Tudyk - A Robot, Sonny -  uniquely different from other Robots as Sonny has emotions, senses and can dream also.
V.I.K.I. - a computer controlled logical system that controls all robots. A destructor by nature.

Background:
Place: Chicago
Year: 2035
Spooner is a super cop Detective with hi-fi car and other electronic gadgets. He dislikes robots and believes that robots can anytime misbehave and become a threat to humankind. He is a person with innumerate power and sharp skills. His basic reason for not trusting robots is connected to his childhood when he and his sister were drowning in their car in a river and the robot saved only him and let his sister drown because logically robot sensed that Spooner had more chances of survival that his sister. This incident keeps on disturbing him in his sleep in the form of a dream and haunts him.
Susan is working in USR laboratory where robots are made. She understands robots better than anyone and believes that robots are the best friends of mankind. She differs with Spooner on his distrust on robots.
Dr. Alfred is a Bio man who is at no. 2 in USR and is making a new breed of robots (NS-5) that can understand and serve mankind better than the earlier breeds. He believes in three basic principles of robotics:
1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law
Robertson is a pure business tycoon busy in creating robots and supplying in the market and growing his business day by day by introducing better and better robots. But in a way he wants to overpower all mankind through his robots power force. He is the creator of VIKI
Sonny is a robot with some exceptions. He has emotions, feelings and he dreams also. He dreams. He dreams that one day all robots will be misused by some selfish men and then another powerful man will come to save the robots and get them free for a better cause.
VIKI has no physical form. She is logic and exists just as a female face in air. She is the key who can make all robots to revolutionize one day and go against mankind.

Storyline
Spooner gets a call from USR that Dr. Alfred has committed suicide. When he reaches there he smells something fishy that Dr. Alfred has not committed suicide but has been murdered and doubts zero down on a robot, Sonny. Gradually understands that Sonny is difference from other robots as he has emotions. Moreover it conflicts with the three principles of robots on which robots function. Still carries on his arguments with Dr. Calvin that robots are not safe to use. His conflict with Robertson gets serious over the issue of Sonny and ultimately Robertson orders Dr. Calvin to destroy Sonny.
Simultaneously Robertson assigns a task force of robots to destroy Spooner as Spooner is getting more and more into his business to understand what really his goals are.
Now, Spooner, Calvin and Sonny are on one side as good guys. On the other side are VIKI, a huge task force of robots, and Robertson to destroy these three.
And ultimately Spooner destroys VIKI, Robertson. All bad robots turn back to nice robots after the destruction of the logical force controlling them (VIKI).

1514242,1,B00005JN0T,"This movie has some of the worst writing I've ever seen. Everything Will Smith says is a snarky joke about something, and nothing he does in the film is consistant with his back story and is only to make the movie seem like it's witty. Every character is a 1 Dimension cliche' cop drama character; from the cop with a bad attitude but a heart of gold to the police chief who for some reason wastes all of his time and energy with just ONE cop in an entire city.

The CGi doesn't stand the test of time, which is a shame because they center the whole movie around it, putting no effort into character or plot. Bridget Moynahan plays a better robot with her stiff lifeless acting then the terrible robot animation that moves way too fluidly. Also, Shia Labeouf is in this doing the exact same character he does in every movie he's in, but his role is this movie is basically the same as Denny from The Room.

The action sequences keep going to bullet time in moments that in no way call for it. There's just a scene of the robot jumping, and they go bullet time only to make it seem cooler but only makes you realize this director has no idea what he's doing. The most annoying thing about this whole movie is that Will Smith is the ONLY person in the WHOLE world who's put off by robots. Not one other character wishes to drive their own cars, do their own chores, and NO one seems to mind that artificial intelligence is taking jobs from humans. Will Smith even mentions this, and no where in the movie is this regarded as an issue. Literally this entire world feels fake because there seem to be to conflicts what so ever, and if Will Smith's character wasn't here, nothing would have ever happened.

The three laws of robotics are like something a 12 year old came up with. Why would everyone trust a major corporation so much? These robots run their lives now, and no one is worried that a mirror to Apple has put themselves into every aspect of people's lives. It's like they could flip a switch to turn off the 3 laws of robots, and then Robot Apple rules the world. Seriously, why is no one else suspicious of this company?

The characters make no sense, the action is boring and predictable, and this whole thing feels like Michael Scott wrote it about himself.",1370390400,5,2268,4.367298578199052

Bridget Moynahan as Susan Calvin, Alan Tudyk as Sonny, James Cromwell as Dr. Alfred Lanning, Bruce Greenwood as Lawrence Robertson, Chi McBride as Lt. John Bergin round out the cast in this mind-blowing special-effects extravaganza. Alex Proyas, who directed ""The Crow"" (1994) & ""Dark City"" (1998) is excellent and has directed another sci-fi masterpiece to add to his resume. The story by Jeff Vintar and screenplay by Vintar and Akiva Goldsman is excellent. The music by Marco Beltrami is well crafted and excellent. The cinematography by Simon Duggan is excellent. The film editing by Shawn Broes, William Hoy, Richard Learoyd, Armen Minasian is excellent. The casting by Juel Bestrop, Coreen Mayrs, Jeanne McCarthy is excellent. The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos, who also designed Proyas' ""Dark City"" (1998) & Smith's ""Independence Day"" (1996) has made an excellent look into what the future will look like in the next 50 years. The costume design by Liz Keogh, Elizabeth Palmer, Lizzie Palmer is excellent. The visual effects and animation by Digital Domain is excellent and looks to be an possible Oscar nominee for Best Visual Effects for next year's Oscars.

I finally saw it last night and this is one of those instances (at least for me) where ""an already great movie was made even greater."" Of course, it cannot compare against Titanic 3D (a must-own if you have 3D and which ALMOST ALL 3D movies pale against--natively shot OR converted let me tell ya!), but it does a more-than-decent job. So much so that it exceeded my expectations to the point where the 3D had me smiling...many times!

It's matted 16:9 aspect ratio adds (rather than detracts from--or so ""purists"" say) to the 3D experience in spades. Even I was at first overly conscious about it and at the beginning it was a bit distracting to know that it wasn't OAR, but all that quickly transformed into a very pleasing and more visceral experience (IMHO) which was greatly accentuated by the DTS HD-MA 5.1 lossless sound--another feature which made this purchase all that more worthwhile! It was like seeing it for the first time! Man, that robot (""Sonny"") is soooo well-made (and magnificently voiced by Alan Tudyk)!

3D/Sci-Fi/Thriller enthusiasts: add this to your home library, along with Top Gun 3D, sit back and enjoy ;) !!",1366761600,,1410,4.587301587301587
1514330,4,B00005JN0T,"I liked the movie and the portrayal of a robotic-run world. However, there was one thing I thought was amusing about this movie. It is set about 10 or 20 years in the future and there's no way in 10 to 20 years we'll be that advanced AND in complete belief of the perfection of technology (there would definitely be more critics and people who do not believe that robots are infallible).

What is thought provoking about this movie is the question, ""what do we owe to the things we create."" There is one human-like robot in this movie in the sense that it has emotions, free choice, and can lie. So what does it mean to destroy it? Does it mean anything if it says ""I don't want to die"" or ""I'm scared to die."" I think the movie AI and play stations clip about Kara (found on youtube) are do a good job of showing how the line between human and robot begins to blur when the mechanical beings are coupled with very human like attributes. This movie is about the first experience with a human-like robot and how a robot in every home can turn into a robot army.",1366416000,2,1060,4.247524752475248

1514629,4,B00005JN0T,"I liked this movie. There were only a couple of things about it that annoyed me. One good thing about it was it starred Will Smith, but that was also the bad thing about it.

  Here's what I mean by that. The character of Del Spooner as written by Isaac Asimov is completely flat and uninteresting. That's true for all of his characters, come to think about it. Asimov was an idea-man. His stories were always more about ideas than characters. I've read many of his stories, and while they always had interesting plots, the characters themselves were boring and lifeless.

  Now along comes Will Smith, and suddenly, Del Spooner has some life to him. He actually seems more like a real person, which is great! Sort of. Some small doses of what I call ""Smith-isms"" would have been welcome here. But as usual, he has to go over the top with it, and this gets annoying after a while.

  What I am talking about is ""Generic Action Hero"" Will Smith, where he pretty much just plays himself. You take any of his characters from his movies that start with an ""I"", and they are all the same guy - completely interchangeable. Independence Day, I am Legend, I Robot... he plays the same guy in every one. In all of those, he needs to take his shirt off for the audience (or in the case of I Robot, also show his butt in the shower). He also needs to say a lot of one-liners. And in some cases, he'll say or do something to someone to show how macho he is, then follow that up with another smart line that's supposed to show what a tough guy he is. But to me, it just makes him seem like a jerk.

  Like the line, ""Hold my pie. Hold it or wear it, sir."" Supposed to be funny, right? But it's a Will Smith thing, not a Del Spooner thing. And it just makes me dislike the guy. It is kind of jarring, and this movie is filled with Smith-isms like that. You just have to get over it if you want to enjoy this movie.

  I don't dislike Will Smith. I just wish he would tone it down a little. I don't really need to see his bare chest and butt - which has nothing to do with the story of this movie at all. I guess that's for the ladies, right? Except my wife watched it, and she just wanted him to put some clothes on.

  Will Smith is like Tom Hanks in that way, where he pretty just plays himself no matter what he's in. Most people like Tom Hanks, so that's not usually a problem. Same for Will. And that's all I've got to say about that!

  Back to the movie. I think Bridget Moynahan did a great job as Susan Calvin. Again, we had a pretty boring, lifeless character as written by Asimov. And this actress managed to rise above the lousy characterization and make Calvin seem more human. I liked this a lot.

  Probably the best character in the movie though wasn't a human at all. It was Sonny, the CGI robot. This was really well done. One of the best highlights of the movie, IMO.

  I'm not an Asimov fanboy who is hung up over the differences between the book and the movie. I've read the book, and I don't mind the title and elements of it being lifted to make something different. The book was a collection of short stories. It could never have been translated directly to the big screen. Instead, they just used Asimov's ideas about the future and made their own story. This worked out just fine, I thought.

  I really liked the ideas presented in this movie. The tone of the movie felt right - except when interrupted by Smith-isms. But I learned to ignore those. I enjoyed how the movie made you think about the plot. Not everything was completely explained. I had to watch it twice before I really understood the story.

  As far as the 3D Blu-Ray goes, I am sorry to say that I have to agree with most of the other reviewers who gave the 3D a poor rating. There is nothing wrong with the 3D in this movie. The problem is that there's just so little of it. There are long stretches of the movie where there is no 3D at all. I actually took off my 3D glasses at one point just to see if I was missing anything. Nope. The screen was perfectly clear. I was wearing glasses for no apparent reason. And then when the movie does have 3D, none of it pops from the screen. It is all just depth effects. The same effect that can be achieved with your 3D TV's auto-3D function (at least if you have an LG). Overall, it was a disappointing 3D purchase. If you have the 2D version, you're good to go. Trust me, you're not missing anything.

  Some complained about the 3D Blu-Ray widescreen being cropped or something or other. I didn't notice anything like that, and I've seen it both ways. It seemed perfectly normal to me.

  Also, there seems to be some confusion about what exactly is included with this disk. Here's what you get: 1 Blu-ray disk, and 1 DVD disk. When you play the Blu-ray, you can choose whether you want to play it in 2D or 3D. As for special features, I don't know the difference between this and the regular Blu-ray version.

  Overall, it's a good movie and I'm glad I've got it. I'm not crazy about Will, but he does an okay job here. I wish the movie were less action-oriented and more cerebral, but you can't have everything. The 3D is forgettable, and disappointing to 3D fans such as myself. Buying this version versus the regular Blu-ray is pretty much no difference, except the regular is cheaper.

1514630,3,B00005JN0T,"I, Robot (Widescreen Edition) is a 2004 science-fiction action film starring Will Smith in the lead as Dell Spooner. The story centers around a world which has invited real functioning robots that aid human kind in its everyday tasks. One day, the founder of U.S. Robotics is found dead and the mystery begins. The special effects are quite good and the music is very effective. The film clocks in at 115 and that feels a bit rushed. Also the ending could have been bit less predictable.

1514701,4,B00005JN0T,"Well, reasonably so. I like this film, did from its cinema release and on DVD. On Blu-ray is it awesome. The 3D conversion version is worth the extra coin and the actual conversion has been done extremely well, with few, if any, artifacts or depth-of field/focus screw-ups.

While Will Smith was his typical self, showing (I think), the right amount of strength, weakness, brashness and humour, I have always thought that the part of Susan Calvin was rather underplayed by Bridget Moynahan and that a more animated performance was required, from someone like Sandra Bullock, or even Mary McDonnell (now that would be interesting).

There are plenty of reviews out there that say pretty much what I would, although I personally think this movie is a lot better than it has generally been given credit for. While I liked the DVD, the 3D Blu-ray version is stunning. The 3D effect has worked a treat and the upgrade to the soundtrack is fabulous. I have the advantage of now, (since a major upgrade), watching movies at home via a quality projector on a really big (136"" 16:9) screen, which makes the 3D experience (and the 11.2 sound experience too) simply mind-blowing. Just like the experience of watching 3D in a big-screen suburban cinema, the picture envelopes you and the depth of the 3D becomes an almost natural view (except for the fact that you need special specs).",1356912000,2,1373,4.813559322033898

This was middle of the road +.  There were some weird overlaps of backgrounds and foregrounds (bending of light where the two meet).  There was a slightly flat feel through the entire thing, which ain't good when rating 3D quality.  The high def was very good, even on my 110 inch projection screen, so the package doesn't get the three stars I would have given it based solely on the 3D, but I can't go above a 4 because of the 3D (I think I'm already being generous).

I think the process could work, but it still needs more human involvement.  Convert, watch the movie with a critical eye, tweak the conversion, watch again, rinse and repeat...  :)

Maybe in the near future we'll have a better automated conversion process so we can get all the classics in 3D before 3D becomes a dead technology (again).  I hope it doesn't, but many movies came out in 3D decades ago and eventually they went bye-bye, so it could happen again.

I am using a top of the line blu ray 3D player and a new LG TV and I found I Robot to be a big disappointment and a very bad sign of where 3D (conversion) is headed -- studios using the cheaper conversion option and movies having little depth and no pop-out whatsoever.

The funny thing about the I Robot conversion to me was the small on-screen menu that would appear when prompted was the ONLY popout in the whole movie and the sad thing about that is that it immediately and constantly shows you and reminds you of how the movie COULD have been.

I do think the 3D version of I Robot is better than just the bluray experience BUT when you watch other 3D movies like Titanic and Avatar you'll see a day and night difference. At least I sure did.

To all studios: I will be re-thinking future decisions on 3D purchases if this is what you'll be offering us. What I see in I Robot is not worth the $30 pricetag at all. It's an amazing and entertaining technology but you are going to miss your opportunity if this is what you'll be offering us.",1351641600,6,1117,4.205607476635514
1514851,3,B00005JN0T,"First, I must qualify my equipment; top shelf equipment was only used for this review. Secondly, I am a fan of Will Smith and specifically am a fan of the movie, ""I Robot"". I already owned the initial DVD, then Blu-Ray and now the 3D Blu-Ray release of this movie. Needless to say, I had been waiting anxiously for this converted 2D - 3D version to arrive!

Having already experienced the gold standard for 3D Blu-Ray releases, ""Avatar"" I am fully aware of the capabilities of the 3D experience Blu-Ray can provide. I have a high expectation of what to expect in a 2D to 3D conversion and was hoping ""I Robot"" would be another wonderful visual experience! However, the gamble Fox has taken in using the new cheaper and less time consuming JVC Kenwood 2D3D workstation is one based solely upon the opinion the average consumer will not know the difference with a more realistic, but time-consumming process such as employed by Legend 3D (""Hugo"","" Transformers: Dark of the Moon"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", ""Shrek"", and others). In a word, I was very disappointed!

It was P.T. Barnum who supposedly said, ""You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time."" I think this was the basis of Fox's final decision to use the JVC Kenwood process.

All business must make a calculated decision regarding their bottom line. The quality of a final product along with the time to market are part of any business equation.  With Fox's plans to release more movies in this pseudo 3D format, it appears their return on investment (ROI) has trumped their use of a higher quality conversion process.

Most higher quality products requires a skilled artisan's trained eye and hands, just like a quality crafted gilded chair. Such a beautiful object simply takes time and higher quality wood and materials. However, a cheap chair churned out in an overseas factory, using the cheapest of materials doesn't require skilled labor. Such are the products infesting our nation today. However, quality takes time and time is money.

So far, I have been writing metaphorically and I promise to be more specific shortly. But, when discussing how we perceive our senses, it is oftentimes best to use such a method to get one's idea across.

For example, would you prefer an aged Kentucky whiskey that has been aged in wooden barrels for the past 12 years, or one produced last month and is already in your glass? Or, would you prefer a Michael Angelo original painting or Elvis on velvet from a street vendor in a foreign country?

Unfortunately, we have been conditioned to oftentimes think something cheaper is somehow better. But, we all know we oftentimes get what we pay for.

In the case of this movie, it is still a good story, with great actors. But, behind the scenes, Fox took the cheapest road to market and it shows!

Specifics; throughout the movie there are many glaring instances in which the perceived depth was shown as if there were flat objects placed at various distances from the camera. It reminded me of the cardboard popups in the TCM movie opening sequences in which various movie characters would pop up from the pages of a book when it was opened to a different page.

In this movie, you have ""flat"" characters and objects placed at different distances from the camera, or point of reference. There are also absolutely no ""screen pop"" experiences as there are in ""Avatar"". The depth shown in ""John Carter 3D"" and ""Titanic"" was very impressive. The depth in this movie was also adequately simulated. But, the characters in the other movies referenced possessed realistic curvatures and shapes and were not simply placed within space as a ""flat"" cutout cardboard character.

When discussing spatial issues it is oftentimes difficult to express sensory experiences, as we all process and interpret what our senses tells us a little bit differently than others. What may be noticeable to me may be missed by others. Some people will ""perceive"" the depth simulated in this movie as being lifelike, when in my opinion this is not how I perceive my world around me!

It is perhaps this difference Fox is banking upon. Perhaps they're hoping enough potential customers will not notice these spatial and optical qualitative differences and will therefore continue to pay a premium price for a movie they probably already have in their collection, like I do. It is an effective way to continue to harvest the gems they have in their vaults. Or, if you prefer; they will continue to milk the same cash cow until she runs dry! I have no objections to this, as long as I feel I am getting my money's worth!

Fox has a wonderful and historical film library which includes many gems yet to be released on any format and many I'd wish to own. But, in the future, I will be more cautious of any future Fox 3D Blu-Ray 2D-3D conversion releases if they continue using the JVC Kenwood process. Unless they significantly improve this process, I will probably look for more releases by other studios using the Legend 3D process, or of movies shot in real 3D. It is a shame they decided to take the cheaper route.

I would hope others would gladly have paid a premium for the better quality processes, just as I would. Quality craftsmanship still means something to me. Does it to you too?",1351382400,7,5406,4.7239915074309975

1514902,5,B00005JN0T,"I've loved I, Robot since it's release; and am thrilled that they put the money & effort into converting it into 3D. _ The ""3D Conversion"" process has gotten 1000% better since it's inception; and now, it's rivaling ""Real 3D"" (shot in 3D) films... In fact, it's gotten so good, that if I didn't know better, I'd swear they shot this film in 3D to begin with... it's that good! __ I have a 2012 Panasonic VT50 (65"" - nearly $4,000), so if you get a ""cheap-o"" 3D-TV, your experience may not be as good as it could be; but I didn't notice a single mistake/problem w/ the conversion; and believe me, I was looking for them.
-- In fact, most people confuse most 3D-Converted Film problems (ghosting, etc.) with it being a problem with the 3D-TV itself -- when in fact, it was a Conversion mistake/problem, in identifying field-depth and so on, during the conversion process.

ANYWAY... The first one I saw that rivaled 'Real 3D' and had no errors at all, was Titanic (also a 20th Century Fox release)... So in addition to the conversion technology being vastly improved, this also means that they (Fox) are at least taking the effort (and money) to see that it's done correctly and error-free... even if it means it's a lengthier & more expensive process.

My single complaint about this release, is the ""Bonus Feature"" dismissal.  The original Blu-Ray release was loaded with (good) bonus features; and while I've come to expect most 3-D Discs having none at all (something Sony has no trouble with, by the way)... I expected it to come with either a separate Blu-Ray disc (normally, identical to the initial release), or at least have the 'best of the best' features included on the DVD. __ Well, there is no separate Blu-Ray disc included, despite it being billed as ""Blu-Ray 3D / Blu-Ray / DVD Combo""... and so, I'm forced to keep my original blu-ray disc & swap it out with the DVD disc included in this ""combo"", so I can keep the awesome bonus features (3 Commentaries, Several CG & Behind the Scenes things, and more)... So, instead of selling my extra (Original) Blu-Ray, I now have only the extra DVD to sell (which is another thing... who on Earth, needs, or wants a DVD of this, if they're buying a Blu-Ray 3D version!??)

At any rate - Very impressed with the 3D Conversion... Keep 'em coming!

1514904,4,B00005JN0T,"There are many films which some people love and other people hate. It is less common for the same person to both love and hate a film, but I felt that way about ""I, Robot."" If you like science fiction and come at this with no preconceptions, not having read the original, you may well find it to be a fairly entertaining movie.

However, if you are a big fan of Isaac Asimov, and particularly of his robot stories such as the original short story collection ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Robot/dp/055338256X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Robot</a>"" there is a strong possibility that you will be absolutely infuriated by this film.

Firstly, this is because most of Asimov's robot books were works of absolute genius both for the time they were written and even by comparison with events and things which have been written since. Asimov's depictions of robots and computers are far closer to the reality of computers and machines which surround us today than were the mechanical frankenstein monsters which every previous author who wrote about robots created. To be in the same league as Asimov's books the film would have had to be brilliant, and it isn't.

Secondly, the scriptwriters have used the name of one of Asimov's books, the names of two of his characters, and his three ""laws of robotics"" to produce a film which at first sight appears dangerously close to being exactly the type of robot story which Asimov detested and was trying to get away from.

As Asimov explained himself, he wanted to move on from the cliche in which every film or book about robots retold the story of Frankenstein with robots as the monster, repeating a cycle in which, to quote him, ""robots were created and destroyed their creators; robots were created and destroyed their creators.""

Some Asimov fans will see the film ""I Robot"" as way too close to falling into exactly that pattern and will loathe it for this reason. The character Susan Calvin in the film, despite some good acting by Bridget Moynahan, is also a disappointing shadow of the much more human person created in Asimov's books.

There is a massive irony in that in two of the most famous Sci-Fi stories about robots to be turned into films - this one and ""Blade Runner"" (Link:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner-The-Final-Cut-2-Disc-Special-Edition-DVD-1982/dp/B000G8NPWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner: The Final Cut (2-Disc Special Edition) [DVD] [1982</a>]) - the film diametrically reversed the message of the original story in mirror image directions. In Philip K Dick's short story ""Do androids dream of electric sheep"" the robots were incapable of empathy and the readers' sympathies were meant to be mainly with the person who has the unpleasant job of eliminating them: Ridley Scott reversed this in ""Blade Runner"" in which sympathy lies with the robots.

By contrast, Isaac Asimov's robot stories such as the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Robot/dp/0586025324/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Robot</a>"" were about as pro-robot as you can get: I don't want to explain this too precisely, to avoid ""spoiling"" the message of this film but but basically in this film director Alex Proyas changes the message in the opposite direction to Ridley Scott.

In other words, perhaps Scott and Proyas should have swapped source books. If Ridley Scott wanted to make a pro-robot movie he could have made one based on ""I, Robot"" and Alex Proyas could have made a robot menace movie based on ""Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep."" Instead Scott made a pro-robot movie based on perhaps the most brilliantly written anti-robot story and Proyas made a robot menace movie named after probably the most brilliantly written pro-robot book!

Having said all that, even from the viewpoint of an Asimov purist there are good things about this movie. During the first half of the film, Will Smith as Del Spooner, a paranoid detective who is something equivalent to an anti-robot racist, is the only person who suspects that anything might be wrong with the robots. During this part of the story, all the robots, except one apparent rogue, act exactly as Asimov predicted that his ""three laws of robotics"" could be used to make them support human society. Some robots continue to do so throughout the book and are effectively sympathetic characters rather than demons.

Other good things in the film - there is some excellent acting, particularly from Smith, Moynahan, and James Cromwell who plays the father of robotics, Dr Alfred Lanning. The robot character Sonny was created using CGI based on the movements of actor Alan Tudyk (who played the pilot Wash in Serenity / Firefly) in the same way that Gollum was created for the ""Lord of the Rings"" films. This was particularly well done, but special effects were spectacularly good throughout the film.

Dramatic tension was well managed and you are made to care about most of the characters. There is some excellent humour in the film. Overall I didn't think it was a bad film.

If you like science fiction films and have not read any of Asimov's robot novels, give this a try and you will very probably enjoy it. If you have read and enjoyed the original novels, and are willing to accept that a film inspired by them does not have to rigidly follow all of Asimov's ideas, then the same will apply.

If however you are a huge Asimov fan and are likely to be offended by people who are not quite up to his level of genius taking liberties with his work, you should probably leave this film alone.",1350604800,,5645,5.122826086956522
1514905,4,B00005JN0T,"If you are detective Spooner, your beat is Chicago's Precinct 28, not a bad neighborhood, if it wasn't for the abominable robots - they're everywhere; the very sight of one fills you with revulsion and guilt.  Everyday you are haunted by flashbacks of that terrible auto accident - you survived, but the little girl ... well ... that robot, that glorified can opener, should have save her...  You hate them!

If you are Lt. Bergin, you have taken Spooner under your wing, he is a good detective, but his obsessive suspicion of robots interferes with his judgement.  When Spooner is called to investigate the apparent suicide of Dr. Lanning in the atrium lobby of the U.S. Robotics tower, you fervently hope he doesn't foolishly blame a robot for Lanning's death.

If you are Dr. Susan Calvin, you worked closely with Dr. Lanning, shared his dream, and you thought you knew him ... his suicide came as a surprise.  When you escorted Spooner to Lanning's lab, you were annoyed by his rude comments about robots, stunned when a robot picked up a gun, and horrified when Spooner shot the robot as it escaped.

If you are Sonny, you are in a state of confused emotions.  Fear, guilt, and anger wash over you as the detective grills you; especially anger ... over ... his insistence that you murdered your father!  Impossible!  You are a robot. . . .

Comment:  The film portrays a believable near-future when humanoid robots are common; what is not believable is the way the robots are retired.  Understand, the older robots are quiet humanlike, well mannered, likable, you might even say lovable, and yet, when they are trucked to the landfill, no one speaks up for them.

The only things that I have to say is that I hope they took their time changing it over and it's not riddled with ghosting problems. I have a feeling that a lot more movies like this one are going to become 3-D and I hope they do them right. To me, there's nothing worse than taking a movie that is already a blockbuster hit and turning into a 3-D flop. I've got my fingers crossed.

1514970,4,B00005JN0T,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""I, Robot"" staring Will Smith. It was an interesting DVD. The movie was a futuristic tale, but only going ahead to the year 2035 so a lot of Chicago (the movie site) and it's people looked very much like today. A really big difference was the appearance and abundance of human-like robots who performed many, if not most, of the ordinary tasks of day to day life. This was a clever part of the movie, and the robots were very well done. These things looked like humans, talked like humans and moved like humans, but they were clearly not humans dressed up in costumes (as in Star Trek, let's say) for the purpose of the movie. What were they? Well, I don't know, but they were fascinating and they were present in great abundance. It's probably some clever computer animation trick, but the trick is very well done and a lot of credit is due.

The story itself was not as fresh and new. It introduced the idea of life with robots where Will Smith was a human police detective and was one of the few who had a negative view of robots and their place in human culture. It seems that the robots were programed not to harm humans in any way nor could they be controlled to harm humans. Well, you know this isn't going to last or you wouldn't have much of a movie. Sure enough, a programming change was brought about and the robots began behaving more like humans in the negative sense. Thus began a long drawn out battle between Smith and his human colleagues opposing the human-like robots and their controllers. It involved a lot of action and destruction of anything and everything. The high action level will probably keep you watching carefully. All in all, I found the story to not have a particularly interesting plot and I'd rate it as a three-star movie in that sense. However, the sets and animations and high action are so well done, that I'd give it five stars for that part of the production. Okay, we'll average it out to a four star rating. My hope would be that the clever people who put this thing together will be back with a better plot.

1514972,4,B00005JN0T,"I, ROBOT is based upon ideas created by Isaac Asimov, the beloved and prolific writer who invented many of the ""rules"" for writing modern science-fiction. Asimov's book I, ROBOT is the novel that cemented the three laws of robotics: 1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; 3. A robot must protect its own existence, except where such protection would conflict with the First or Second Law. The movie takes those concepts and one of the main character's from Asimov's novel (Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan) and introduces a story that feels like one of the short stories included in Asimov's I, ROBOT.

In the movie, Will Smith plays Chicago detective Del Spooner. Ever since a freak accident, that the audience is briefly given glimpses of in the opening of the movie, Spooner has had strong misgivings about robots. Even though they are supposed to be incapable of hurting a human, Spooner is convinced that robots are up to no good and he doesn't trust them. His feelings towards the machines are beginning to affect his career. Then, Dr. Lanning, one of the executives of US Robots and a friend of Spooner, is found dead at US Robots headquarters apparently because of a suicide. Spooner doesn't believe that and is convinced it's murder. He begins an investigation which leads to the arrest of a robot for murder. But can a robot kill or is Dr. Lanning's death just a small part of a much more sinister plan?

I, ROBOT is an entertaining film. It's fairly well written and contains some great acting which is augmented by the movie's special effects. Also, watch out for a small role by Shia LaBeouf as Farber, a street smart kid that looks up to Spooner. The film doesn't raise as many questions as the novel it is very loosely based upon. However, the movie still raises a few questions about the nature of humanity and the mechanized society in which we are increasingly becoming consumed. Overall, I, ROBOT is a surprisingly good movie.",1338768000,,2132,4.697860962566845
1514973,5,B00005JN0T,"I Robot is the action-involved mystery based on Issac Asimov's THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS and the character setting of Dr. Susan Calvin one of the characters often appear in Asimov's novels about robot and robotics. Like many of the Asimov novels, robots which seem to be deviating from the laws is the main theme of the plot. The plot reminds me of one of the Asimov's novels ROBOT AND THE EMPIRE in which the robot acted after all to observe the laws, the way humans have not imagined.

Movie plot indeed modernized 62-year-old sci-fi classic. Will Smith plays the role of a cop, who detests robots and acts upon his instincts, who is just like the guy as we have seen in previous signature Will Smith roles such as INDEPENDENCE DAY and MEN IN BLACK series. Robots in this films look so real partly because the robotics today have been developed in the way such robots can be feasible in near future. Nursing robots in particular may soon become like household appliances. What if these robots become defiant and have the mind on their own? So the movie provides us realistic near future scary stories. Much scarier than that of Alien or Predator series. Dr. Alfred Lanning played by James Cromwell gives the story depth and gravity. His character in this film reminds me a bit of late Steve Job of Apple Computer. Overall the film is Will Smith wonderland. The movie makes us think about what is the difference between a robot and a human. If robot has a mind of its own are we prepared to be their friends or enemies?

Verdict: Not a straight adaptation of Asimov classic but it has stand-alone appeal.

1514974,4,B00005JN0T,"Will Smith certainly gets the interesting science fiction action pictures, doesn't he? This is one of the best he's done. The closing credits say it was ""suggested by"" Asimov's story. But those of us who remember the story will remember that it was a short story, one of several in a book by the same name, but not anything long enough to be a feature-length movie out of it. Still, the necessary elements are there, and what's been made of them would make old Isaac proud.

Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago cop of the not-too-distant future, when robots are becoming very common in society, and everyone knows the three laws of robotics:

1. A robot cannot harm a human, or through inaction allow a human to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders of a human unless they conflict with Rule One.
3. A robot must protect its own existence unless it conflicts with Rule One or Two.

Asimov has promulgated these three laws for long enough that most science fiction fans are familiar with them. We are also familiar with stories written about attempts to circumvent this hard-wired programming. So when a famous robotic designer is found fallen out of his office window onto the marble atrium below, everyone assumes it was suicide, because no one was in the office with him at the time. But Spooner is suspicious of robots (we find out why eventually), and figures the scientist was murdered, possibly by a robot. Sure enough, an apparently out of control robot is discovered in his office, and Spooner figures it for the killer. But of course everyone, including Dr. Susan Calvin, robot psychologist, tells him that's just not possible.

Now, this really is a mystery, and the clues lead everywhere and nowhere, so I don't want to ruin it for you. Let's just say that almost no one in this film is what they seem to be at first, except perhaps Spooner's granny. And don't be too sure about her, either.

It's a real hardware movie, with lots of fast action and things going smash, which should satisfy the younger crowd. But it's also a make-you-think sort of plot at several levels, and that's the kind I especially enjoy. Not to mention seeing Smith bare-chested. The man is buffed!",1336867200,,2196,4.649484536082475

""LAW I: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

LAW II: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law.

LAW III: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.""

The above is found printed on-screen at the beginning of this sci-fi action film.

This movie is loosely based (""suggested by,"" according to the end credits) on Isaac Asimov's short-story collection also entitled ""I, Robot.""

Some people don't seem to like this movie, but I found it interesting.

This movie is set in Chicago in the year 2035.  By this time, anthropomorphic (""human-looking"") robots are doing menial tasks for humans.  All robots have as their core programming the three laws indicated above.  But something seems to go wrong and a human is found dead.  (Not just any human, but a genius roboticist played by James Cromwell.)

Enter homicide detective Dell Spooner (Will Smith who also was one of this movie's executive producers) who has to try to solve exactly what happened.  A robopsychologist (Bridget Moynahan) aids Spooner in his investigation.  (Believe it or not, even robots need shrinks.)

Yes, this movie has plenty of action and special effects.  The action, though, is not mindless and I found myself pausing to think.  As well, the special effects were done well and did not take over the movie.  I liked especially how the robots interacted with humans.  (The technique used for the robots was ""motion capture"" and I found it to be quite effective.)

As I said, this is an action movie that gives you pause to think or consider artificial intelligence and even what it means to be human with respect to such things as consciousness, uniqueness, death, having a purpose in life, free will, creativity, and evolution.

This movie has good background music that aided each scene.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released Dec. 2004) is excellent in picture and sound quality.  It has several extras.

In conclusion, this is a good, futuristic sci-fi movie that causes you to think.  And don't worry: no actual robots were hurt during the making of this movie!!

1514977,4,B00005JN0T,"Isaac Asimov is my favorite sci-fi writer of all times. I have almost everything sci-fi that he has written and have read many of the stories more times than I can remember. This movie introduces Asimov's famous ""Three Robotic Laws"" and an early heroine named Susan Calvin.

Asimov writes of his interest in robots as early as his teenage years and comments that the stories were divided into two classes; robots as menace and robots as pathos. ""These charmed me""  he tells us of the robots as pathos class in the introduction to a collection of robot stories, To the best of my knowledge Asimov never wrote a robot story named ""I, Robot"" but acknowledges he was greatly influenced by a short story of that name written by Eando Binder in late 1938. As a tribute perhaps Asimov later assembled several of his Susan Calvin short stories into a group he named ""I, Robot.""

We also meet Susan Calvin in the movie who was a special character favorite of Asimov's and appeared in 10 short stories about robots. Asimov tells us ""The third robot story I wrote, ""Liar"" introduced Susan Calvin--with whom I promptly fell in love."" In the movie the role of Susan Calvin is beautifully played by Bridget Moynahan.

The Will Smith character, Del Spooner, never appears in any of Asimov's stories to the best of my knowledge. Asimov did have a robophobic policeman named Lije Baley who is introduced in his 1953 novel, ""The Caves of Steel."" Baley is forced to establish a working relationship with a humanoid robot named Daneel Olivaw. The robot, Sonny, voiced by Alan Tudyk, plays a role most similar to the Daneel Olivaw character in ""The Robot Novels"" series.

Just looking at the movie I found it to be a good science fiction action movie and have enjoyed it more than once. If you find the movie interesting I assure you you'll find the books even more so. I see the Robot series as a prelude to the Empire series followed by the extensive Foundation series.  Counting all of the related books there are presently over 15 and three more, written by other authors, have been added with the approval of the Asimov estate. These books are a grand representation of the genre.",1333152000,2,2164,4.666666666666667

I feel that this is Will Smith's best movie, and I think it's pretty cool that he's always been happy to star in science fiction movies, even though he could limit his roles to other genres, if he chose.

Although many people have complained that the film of ""I, Robot"" bears very little resemblance to the Asimove story (which is true), I think that the writer who adapted it for the screen actually did a very good job. Though the narrative is radically different, what remains is the CORE of Asimov's story, that being the Three Laws of Robotics, and Man's impending fear of domination, as artificial intelligence improves. The movie makes sense by contemporary standards, and therefore, the themes of the story can be effectively conveyed to the audience.

Also noteworthy is that the CGI in this movie is topnotch, and the robots have the perfect blend of slickness and creepiness, establishing the notion that they are a thing that humans have come to live with and rely upon in this future, yet humanity has become fearful that this trust is misplaced.",1329782400,2,1217,4.682242990654205

1515042,4,B00005JN0T,"I have to disclose right at the start that I have never read an Isaac Asimov book and so I can only judge the movie without any reference to the book it is based upon.  Now that I've got that out of the way, I also have to say that I have always liked film noir and so movies that are even remotely noir-ish like this one and say ""Blade Runner"" or even ""Gattaca"" have a headstart with me.  That said, while the movies share similarities with each other e.g. the Smith and Harrison cop characters after renegade artificial life forms etc ""I, Robot"" rises above just being a shoot-em up, all action film but also appeals to a thinking audience raising the issue of bigotry and prejudice with Smith's hatred of all things robot based upon his one bad experience with them and how all this changes once he gets to know and understand them better.  There are some elements though that detract from the enjoyment of the movie such as the inclusion of scenes that are not necessary; while I am fan of Shia LeBeuf for example from his work on ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" I thought his scenes were totally useless here and that the film would be far better off without any of his scenes.  I also got the feeling that the film was too short and that far more meat could have been included to the story to develop the main characters more.

The good storyline aside though this movie has excellent 1080p picture and sound quality coming in DTS HD 5.1 MA making this a strong candidate for reference quality blu-ray disc.  The special feature documentaries while not great are still pretty good and unless you are a diehard fan who has to have every single tidbit this average viewer for instance is happy with this release.

I too, am a big fan of this type of Will Smith acting. It's quite a joy to watch and entertaining, especially when he nails one-liners or catchphrases.

Action in the movie is surprisingly well done. You'd think CGI wouldn't give you that full action feel, but producers and the crew did a good job meshing real life and CGI together. It was almost flawless, quite realistic really. I loved the intricate details, like the streets, TV segments, futuristic interfaces and items. In the movie, the future doesn't seem too far off. It's just filled with more technology. Values, cultures, etc. seemed to be relatively the same, which was cool.

I found it impressive how well the sound and audio contributed to the movie. With some speakers or headphones, this movie really comes alive because of the impressive use of symphony, music, musical instruments, and many other sounds. The sound alone was thrilling and pulse pounding.

The animation and CGI work of the robots was astounding. I've never seen facial and animated behavior looked so fluid and believable. Even in 2011, the work accomplished in I, Robot still stands as great CGI work.

This movie is great for sci fi enthusiasts, action flick fans, Will Smith fans, and the general alike. There may be some crude jokes, but definitely tolerable.

I, ROBOT is a loose, roundabout film adaptation of Asimov's work. While it does explore Asimov's more cerebral themes, it emphasizes action and suspense and is tailored towards Will Smith's skills set. So I wouldn't say that it clings firmly to the spirit of Asimov's novels. But, setting that aside, I had fun watching this. Will Smith rarely disappoints.

""Ever since the first computers, there have always been ghosts in the machine, random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols."" So goes James Cromwell's voiceover, establishing a plot thread, engaging in moody foreshadowing. In the year 2035, in a world populated by safe robotic servants, Chicago Homicide Detective Del Spooner investigates the suicide of eminent scientist Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), co-founder and primary designer of U.S. Robotics. Except that to Spooner's trained eye, the suicide theory comes off as skeevy, much to everyone else's disgust. But there's a connection between Spooner and the dead scientist which we eventually learn. Spooner believes that Lanning has deliberately left a trail of bread crumbs for him to follow. Spooner smells a conspiracy. Except that no one's buying his hunch, not when his robot paranoia is so apparent. An early scene demonstrates Spooner's deep-seated prejudices against automatons. In this scene he glimpses a robot loping along with a purse and he instantly sets out in pursuit, assuming (falsely) that the robot was guilty of purse-snatching. Never mind that, historically, no crimes have ever been perpetrated by a robot. The 3 Laws Safe, hardwired into its positronic brain, have always governed a robot's behavior, curbed any and all potentially harmful act.

Spooner's digging for clues in the towering U.S. Robotics facility leads him to encounters with various characters of note. Bruce Greenwood plays a shady executive at U.S. Robotics, and, yes, he immediately registers on Spooner's radar. Greenwood is pushing to mobilize the corporation's latest robot model, the NS-5, seeking to place one in every home. The detached and very literal Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) is, ironically, a robot psychologist. She specializes in facilitating the interface between humans and robots. She strives to make the robots seem more human. Spooner has loads of fun tweaking her. Spooner also meets two non-humans: VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence), the A.I. who runs operations at U.S. Robotics. And Sonny the prototype NS-5 model. Sonny is strikingly different from its fellow robots. As voiced by Alan Tudyk, Sonny projects an inquisitiveness and an appealing sense of individuality. But its suspicious conduct plants him square on top of Spooner's suspect list, and never mind Asimov's Three Robotic Laws. It turns out, there are ghosts in the machine.

The closing credits indicate that the film was ""suggested"" by Isaac Asimov's anthology book, and ""suggested"" is right. By no means does I, ROBOT adhere to Asimov's stories. This is a sci-fi thriller with elements of a whodunit, and it's enjoyable on that level. The visual effects are spectacular. Will Smith, one of Hollywood's true superstars, works his Will Smith magic, his charm and accessibility on full blast. But his greatest strength may be his ability to humanize his characters. In fact, Del Spooner seems to be one of only two characters here invested with a telling emotional trajectory and with character growth (the other is Sonny). Smith is also equally adept at playing action hero. This is something you can't consistently say about Shia LaBoeuf who has a supporting bit here as a completely irrelevant teen pal of Spooner's. LaBoeuf's presence helps to dumb down the movie. I sort of wish he was exempt from the Three Laws of Robotics. I meant the character he plays here, of course...",1318291200,2,4048,5.2631578947368425

Anyway, leaving behind all references to the original material, I was initially disappointed in the screen adaptation of ""I Robot.""  To no great surprise, within a short time I forgot everything about the film.  Curious to take a second look, I did so (on DVD) and found that I enjoyed the flick more sitting at home than viewing it in a movie theater.  Maybe upon a second viewing, I came into it expecting little and, therefore, wasn't nearly as disappointed.  Knowing there would be almost no ""heady"" material, I just sat back and watched things getting thrashed around.  The FX seemed fine to me.  In keeping with the lightweight material, I enjoyed Will Smith's performance much more.  He has some good one-liners, and maintains an almost light-hearted demeanor throughout any catastrophe, which some may claim as campy.  I decided to purchase this DVD because I knew that in another several months or a year, I'd forget everything about the story entirely.  This is fine with me because I'm not always in the mood to watch something memorable.  Maybe I'm nuts but I sometimes enjoy popping in a DVD that rings no bells, sitting back and thinking, ""Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah,"" as if being brought to remember some half-forgotten dream of no particular significance.  I find it fun.  So, for those who have a short-term memory problem, go ahead and buy this film (which can be purchased for a pittance).",1297382400,,1561,4.776119402985074
1515095,4,B00005JN0T,"""I, Robot is very well done science fiction entertainment.  The story is roughly based upon the great Isaac Asimov's robot stories, particularly ""Robot Dreams"" which was one of his last robot stories.  This one is set in the 2030s.  Robots are well-accepted components of society, and humans are growing increasingly dependent upon them.  ""US Robots"" is a huge and powerful company that manufactures the robots.

US Robots is about to release a much more intelligent and powerful robot model.  Detective Del Spooner (Wil Smith, from Independence Day) has reason to doubt the safety of the new robots, and it turns out he has a point.  More would be telling.

This one is faithful to Isaac Asimov's vision of robots integrated into human society, and the effects that this might have.  The special effects are terrific, and the robots are believable and realistic.  The story, while somewhat over the top, is nonetheless engaging and fast-paced.  Next, I would like to see a movie made of Asimov's Elijah Bailey series of novels, which is also part of the ""Robot"" series.  This movie proves that this would be practical.

1515238,5,B00005JN0T,"This film borrows its title from a collection of short stories written by Isaac Asimov (there actually is no individual story or novel called ""I, Robot"").  It also borrows several concepts and terminology from Asimov's ""Robot"" series, particularly the ""Three Laws of Robotics"", the first of which is: ""A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm"".  The movie received a lot of criticism from classic sci-fi fans because it is not really an adaptation of any of Asimov's stories, and because some of the action actually VIOLATES the Laws of Robotics.

However, this movie has a deeper connection to classic science fiction than many fans realize.  This movie combines themes from Asimov's ""Robot"" stories with ANOTHER classic science fiction story.  This story is ""With Folded Hands"" by Jack Williamson.  In the Jack Williamson story, a bunch of black robots appear on earth ostensibly to ""help"" human beings but in reality to protect them from any danger at all.  By the end of the story humans are being lobotomized and kept safely in padded rooms where they can't be harmed.

By combining these two themes, the movie makers are addressing the central conundrum of Asimov's ""Laws"", namely, how far can you go to protect humans before they're no longer human?  In addition, the movie's ending addresses another theme from Asimov's ""Robot"" stories that is actually much deeper than the ""Laws"": as robots drift towards becoming self-aware sentient beings, how will this affect them and humanity?  What will they (and we) turn into?  On the surface this movie appears to pay minimal service to Asimov's writings, but in reality it is built solidly upon a foundation of classic science fiction ideas.",1268956800,,1747,4.989655172413793

How you take this film depends entirely on how you approach it.

If you expect a faithful adaptation of Isaac Asimov, then walk away. The fact that the icy middle-aged Susan Calvin of the stories has been transformed into a young, slightly ditzy love interest tells you all you need to know. This is a big-budget Will Smith action vehicle, with none of the depth and intelligence of Asimov's stories.

But if a popcorn action film is all you're looking for, 'I, Robot' is pretty good. There are some well-choreographed CG action scenes, and director Alex Proyas gives the film an appropriate near-futuristic setting. Smith as the hero Spooner does a reasonable job in a role that doesn't take him far out of his comfort zone, James Cromwell has a few interesting scenes and voice-overs as Dr Lanning, and Alan Tudik infuses Sonny with an appropriate amount of humanity. On the other hand, Bridget Moynahan is very stiff and unconvincing as Calvin, and Bruce Greenwood is largely wasted as the baddie-but-is-he-really Lawrence.

Basically, the plot unfolds as you might expect, with several twists and turns that are fairly easily anticipated ( Spooner's boss demands his badge and throws him off the case? Never saw THAT one coming, did we....). The final revelation at the end is quite well done, though, and represents an interesting take on the Three Laws. There are a couple of other token attempts to be ""deep"", such as Lanning's monologues, but this is relative. ""Deep"" for a Hollywood blockbuster will not impress those used to the metaphysics of Asimov's tales.

Provided you're happy to overlook the fact that this is 'I, Robot' is little but name, this film is a fair enough Will Smith vehicle. A fun way to spend a few hours, but don't expect it to tax your brain.",1261699200,2,1788,4.811074918566775

So Wil Smith is excellent as always, and the character of Doctor Kelvin is pretty cool (can't remember who plays her, but at least they don't alter her basic nature too much.) The plot could have been really good - part of the tragedy of this movie is how much potential it had - but the production went for big kabooms instead of any sense of realistic action. The quest for a bigger, badder action scene absolutely ruined this movie. They might have followed the three laws and used plot elements form Asimov's book, but they threw the basic laws of physics out the window and made the whole set-up ""too stupid to live"" for the sake of shiny effects instead of playing it straight.

It successfully presents many of the themes and concerns that Asimov had in his stories and extrapolates further on them.  There are various event that were taken verbatim from the stories in the book.

The big problem I had was with the execution of the movie.  The story seemed to jump around with very little character development or explanations as to why things were happening.  At the movies conclusion, I was still left somewhat confused as to what ultimate outcome was intended. With a little more attention to the story and characters, this could have been a very good action movie.

1515303,4,B00005JN0T,"I find it a little hard to describe why I like I, Robot so much. I feel drawn to the movie again and again. In a certain fashion, this is typical of the work of Alex Proyas, the director of I, Robot. Alex Proyas is probably best known for directing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-Miramax-Dimension-Collector-s-Series/dp/B000059XUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow (Miramax/Dimension Collector's Series)</a>, with Brandon Lee, the ill-fated son of Bruce Lee. The Crow is a cult classic, loved by goths the world over, and its cachet is only increased by the untimely death of Brandon Lee during filming of the movie. Proyas also directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-City-Director-s-Cut-Blu-ray/dp/B0018O4YSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark City (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray</a>], a lesser cult film, but a cult film nonetheless, and also one of my favorites. Proyas apparently has a knack for this kind of thing.

I like I, Robot, even though in a certain sense I find its premise intrinsically implausible. That is because I am generally a fan of the Lucas-Penrose argument for the impossibility of creating an artificial intelligence by means of a computer algorithm (meaning a Turing machine more generally). Refutations of this argument often verge on the comical, because they are often forced to end up insisting that humans cannot reason, either. Part of the problem here is that Lucas is a philosopher, and many (most?) scientists and mathematicians haven't got any clue what he means by ""reasoning"". Reasoning, as he means it, simply cannot be an entirely physical phenomenon, as argued by Aristotle in De Anima. I am on record in public (admittedly a small public) as predicting that A.I. in the strong sense is impossible for precisely this reason.

Nonetheless, I have no issue with the kind of robots portrayed in I, Robot, because if machine intelligence is possible, it will be something like what you see in this movie. If you create a machine that can reason, then by necessity it will be able to choose good or evil of its own free will. You just might not like the result.

One of the few parts of I, Robot that actually conforms to Asimov's collection of short stories is the Three Laws of Robotics. Asimov created the Three Laws to break the mold of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein on artificial life stories, but Proyas' version of I, Robot restores this fear to the plot.

This fear is driven by the truth that logic, like justice, is cruel. None of us really look good in the harsh light of justice; no one can live up to their own principles. Logic is not much better; few of us can follow our principles to their logical conclusions. As Dr. Alfred Lanning says in response to question, ""Is there a problem with the Three Laws?"", ""The Three Laws are perfect."" There is only one logical conclusion, and robots, by definition, are logical. Even classical philosophies such as Stoicism would be unable to embrace that blunt conclusion.

Asimov actually toyed with this idea himself, as the Zeroth Law of Robotics: A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm. This is the same logical deduction made by VIKI, the malevolent mainframe. Thus, it is not surprising that we fear logic, because logic inexorably leads to our collective perdition. The deeper reason for this is that logic itself is incomplete, especially when expressed in natural language. Any mathematics complex enough to include arithmetic must include an unprovable statement, in the sense that it cannot be deduced from within the system itself. Steve Sailer once noted that contracts are written in something like COBOL. The intent of this is to reduce uncertainty about what the contract actually means. Legalese accomplishes this goal fairly well, but you cannot reduce the uncertainty to zero, because words do not possess absolute definitions, a point made by Fr. Stanley Jaki OSB.

1515493,5,B00005JN0T,"Science fiction inspired from Isaac Asimov. The film is logical but explores a logic that is unique. Robots are built with three ingrained laws. ""Law I / A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Law II / A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. Law III / A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law."" The scientist who designed these three laws and these robots also invented a central governing unit that was nothing but the watchdog of all robots as for respecting these three laws. But he had a doubt at the end of his life, more than a doubt, the conviction that the central unit, called VIKI, was evolving into understanding the three laws by ""herself"". Her protective mission as for humanity became the necessity to ,protect humanity against itself (wars, ecological evils, a suicidal attitude), hence robots where supposed to take over the world, or rather VIKI was supposed to take over the robots to take over the world. Dr Alfred Lanning invented a personal robot that was done to enable a special alarm mission to capture the attention of a particular cop of his friend, the only one who would doubt robot enough to pursue an investigation to the end. Then you have to see the film to understand how such a situation can evolve from a vague danger to a total take-over. Dr Alfred Lanning suggests an explanation: ""There have always been ghosts in the machine. Random segments of code, that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols. Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul. Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light? Why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space, they will group together, rather than stand alone? How do we explain this behavior? Random segments of code? Or is it something more? When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness? When does a difference engine become the search for truth? When does a personality simulation become the bitter mote... of a soul?"" It is not worth much because it would be illogical. A machine can only be logical and push rules in the only logical direction and Asimov is a perfect pessimist in his first stage of development: mechanical logic leads to the total enslavement of humanity. Of course the film finds and exploits a way out, but that's up to you to discover it. This theme of the take-over of humanity by machines is common. In this case the originality is that there is no human mind of any kind behind like in Matrix, or no will to get rid of humanity as a parasite on the side of machines like in Terminator, or even no psychosis caused by some cosmic isolation like in 2001 The Space Odyssey. That makes this film both powerful and simple since it is perfectly logic and situated in one particular place, easy thus to solve.

1. Open on a drowning scene involving our hero, which gets explained in flashback through the movie to the main reflection character.
2. The hero is a cop who lives alone but visits his 'heart of gold' grandmother in order to show his family's died, he's a loner, or just give us an excuse for dialog.
3. Hero actually says to sidekick 'We're not so different, you and I.' (Hero has a robot arm, presumably so he felt some degree of sympathy in an early draft of the script that got trashed.)
4. Hardened but good-natured black cop boss (oh for the 70s) actually says to hero 'Give me your badge'.
5. In classic B-movie/Outer Limits style, the world's biggest company is run by one evil man and about 3 other people. And - of course - he's not evil after all.

Bridget Whatever-her-name-is couldn't act her way out of a paper bag; even James Cromwell looks embarrassed as a hologram. Some of the parallels with slavery and genocide are overworked and unneeded.

But it has a couple of enjoyable sequences even though the robots look fake now (they looked good at the time).

1515577,4,B00005JN0T,"An action/police procedual movie ""inspired"" by the work of Issac Asimov, and starring Will Smith.

I was reluctant to see this movie for a long time, until my friend Bridgette convinced me that it was worth watching. My reluctance came from the fact that the movie is very unlike the original Asimov stories, with only the Laws of Robotics and a few names making the transition.

The movie stars Smith as Del Spooner, Chicago police officer who has a real grudge against robots.  This is hinted at in the opening title sequence, and is later explained in full detail just why Del has a problem with robots that no one else seems to share or understand.  His boss at the precinct can't control him, his beloved grandmother chides him for his attitude, and he rubs everyone and everything raw, especially when it comes to the mechanical entities which now dominate Chicago and the rest of the U.S. in 2034.

So when Robot inventor Dr. Alfred Lanning (played in holograms by James Cromwell) dies in an apparent suicide, but asking for Del in his death message, Del's dislike for robots is put to the test as he visits the gargantuan building that holds US Robotics.  Del's abrasive personality and style are matched against the cool and collected Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynihan).  It seems at first that Del's presence is useless and worse than useless. However, the apperance of Sonny (Alan Tudyk) and evidence suggesting that Lanning could not have committed suicide starts a chain of action sequences and investigations that reveal an audacious plan involving the latest model of robot to be released...

While the movie is 65% action and police procedural, and 30% science fiction, the movie does have a small dose of philosophy and the spirit of the original Asimov work  As a minor spoiler, I will reveal here that, while not put directly in those terms, the movie's plot revolves around the ""0th law"".  The first time I saw the movie, I recognized this immediately, and on this re-viewing, I appreciate that Proyas (who also directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-City-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/0780622553/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark City (New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;subtly inserted this distillation of the three laws.  Proyas is a great director even if this movie, with its car chases and pyrotechnics does not play to his greatest strengths.

Cromwell does fine as a hologram, Moynihan does okay as Calvin.  Tudyk provides a human face to Sonny the robot. Still, this movie, like many of his movies, belongs to Smith's Del Spooner. Smith is as always a protagonist which the viewers can follow. Even if, unlike many of his roles, Del's personality and history have a dark edge that (until this movie) Smith had never really explored before in movie roles.  I note wryly that this is the second SF movie he has been in that he has been a police officer. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-in-Black-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0000640SB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men in Black (Deluxe Edition)</a>&nbsp;being the first).

I also found the full scale mechanical effects to be much more credibly done than the abundant computer graphics which though beautiful, looked a bit too stylish giving certain portions of the film the appearance of anime.

In the literary sense, the original laws of robotics were invented by Isaac Asimov, one of the most prolific science fiction writers of the 20th century and certainly the most influential on the many recent films concerning robots.  Many Hollywood science fiction films have been based on Asimov's three laws and find it helpful to quote them. Other films refer to another of Asimov's inventions, the positronic brain. Bicentennial Man directly quoted the Three Laws of Robotics and Star Trek's android robot, DATA, was often said to have a positronic brain.

The Three Laws of Robotics hold up very well with time and appear to be an inescapably logical way to define the important features of behavior in civilian robots. The laws, which are quoted numerous times in the film, are:

1) A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.
2) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, so long as this does not conflict with the First Law.
3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not interfere with the First or Second Law.

This is not the first film to predict that the outcome of the three laws will be a computer or robot revolution intended to dominate man. This is based on the idea that man needs to be protected from his own warlike nature.  COLLOSUS, The Forbin Project made a very similar prediction, and the concept of a robot police state was also visited in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, though not attributed to the three laws. 2001 and 2010 made a similar projection but for entirely different reasons. Since the days of Frankenstein and probably before that a constant theme of sci-fi and horror is the artificially created turning on their creator.

I believe that Asimov would defend his laws of robotics as being effective in assuring safety, while granting this film the artistic license to use this speculation. I also think that the idea of a robot being able to rebel in violation of the specific wording of the first law is more far fetched than a sentient robot itself.

It is sad that we have not witnessed more humanoid robotic developments in the United States, the country of Asimov's fictional US ROBOTS AND MECHANICAL MEN.  It is HONDA's ASIMO which appears to be the most highly developed commercial robot. Because of the fear and suspicion that people might harbor against robots, HONDA chose to build their latest version of humanoid robot child sized. The big lumbering HONDA robots preceding it were a bit too intimidating and ""Gort"" like.  HONDA is to be congratulated for their pioneering work and will probably see some return on their investment when variations of ASIMO are actually used in science fiction films, as museum guides, and as a general purpose domestic robot initially used to assist disabled or elderly people and ultimately perform all forms of household work. Although not yet fulley autonomous,  ASIMO can currently walk and run on two legs, climb up and down stairs, play a decent game of soccer, recognize people and objects, speak, hear, recognize voices and react to speech appropriately. I would speculate that full autonomy for ASIMO will come within the next 15 years at most, only being limited by the number of calculations per second performed by the  supporting computer hardware and software. For more info about ASIMO search the web using GOOGLE.

I sometimes wonder how much public interest there would be in sending another robot to Mars if the next lander were based on an ASIMO type design?  People might relate to seeing a bipedal humanoid robot walking on the surface of Mars, testing mineral samples for signs of water while occasionally looking into the camera and waving. Needless to say, NASA public relations would benefit immensely.

The three laws of robotics could not be employed without modification in any military robot which might be under development in some secret government lab which would need to destroy human life in the course of assigned duties. Of course, I wouldn't care to imagine what we may have developed for the military, and just how fantastic such robot technology might be once permitted to trickle down to the circles of commerce. At that time it would be necessary to represent something with the effect of Asimov's three laws in these advanced machines.

In the mid 70's (circa 1975) Isaac Asimov made an appearance at New York University, where my wife was attending graduate school. We went to witness his presentation in a packed college audience and he was every bit as impressive as his writings.  Based on the questions and answers, the audience included at least a few people who were familiar with and who had been influenced by Asimov's writings.",1205798400,2,5532,4.8164556962025316

Isaac and Harlan Ellison were good friends that frequently read each others works. Isaac dreamed of having this story made into a movie and asked Harlan to write the screenplay, which he did, and after several rewrites, he sent the final draft to Isaac in 1978. Between these two great authors, and after being lied to by that ""jerk Bob Shapiro, head of Warner Bros."" the movie was never made, even after three more re-writes. But, as Harlan points out, two things stood in the way of getting the movie made: 1-this was post-Star Wars with new movie tech that would make the movie possible, however, as Jules Renard (1864-1910) said, ""Writing is an occupation in which you have to keep proving your talent to people who have none""; and 2-Warner Bros. bought the rights to the screenplay, but studio jerk Shapiro took a meeting with Harlan in which Harlan was told a budget of $17-20 millon, tie up Warner for at least two years, only for Harlan to learn in the meeting that Shapiro hadn't even read the screenplay! It was after both Harlan and Isaac were dead before yet another re-write making the main character for Will Smith, Dr. Susan Calvin is the protag in this story, so this final re-write is similar to ""I, Robot"", but about the only thing in common with the original story by Isaac Asimov is the title, which these studios ""option"" for years at a time, more to keep others from making them, even if they have no intention of ever making the movie themselves!

1515707,5,B00005JN0T,"When I suggested to Will Smith that he should do ""I, Robot"" I warned it was inevitable that people would say the result wasn't close enough to the Azimov's writings. Go ahead - you try. Azimov's books are for reading and I understand that translating it to cinema is a big challenge. For me, there were many scenes in the movie that were exactly what I imagined as I read. Smith's character was a little experimental but after Independence Day, I was completely convinced that a little of his characteristic cockiness would make it more entertaining for modern audiences. I still laugh when I think about him smacking the alien in the face (Independence Day) in their first face-to-face encounter. Azimov's work is not comedy however and I would take that back today, but would still be very happy with Smith as the lead character. I am willing to take responsibility for Smith's humorous deviation from pure Azimov. It was my fault. I will say however, that his portrayal merely added a little rather than being completely different (while not denying that the addition made it different).

Russian immigrant Azimov blended commentary on mass social (and political) movements and cultural differences in his writing as clearly as descriptions of science and environment - which rivaled Jules Verne. The robot rebellion itself, complete with central computer, mirrored the Bolshevik Revolution and rise of Communism. He defined (take this literally) the meaning of ""hero."" (One person can make a difference.) Some might have been more satisfied had the film included a Blade Runner type narration to beat home particulars - to have made the central computer's (V.I.K.I) reasoning for the take-over clearer. While viewing with others previously unfamiliar with the story, I heard some ""What?"" - ""Why?"" and even a ""What's wrong with that?"" The apparent loss of understanding of the evil of dictatorship and value of freedom convinces me that Azimov's work is as important today as it ever was.

I think it is important to bring Azimov's work to the screen, not least because it is some of the very best science fiction produced in the twentieth century. And I do prefer keeping films true to the original work. I would argue that this film is the best adaptation of Azimov so far. Letting action speak for itself - to some extent - is not entirely wrong in film. I am hoping that sci-fi fans everywhere will join me in encouraging more Azimov at the movies in the future; regardless of the challenge. Perhaps a nip and tuck here and there will bring the experience a little closer to the read. But I will now caution viewers just as I caution movie-makers.

If you see this and like it, or love it (as I did/do), this would be a worthy addition to any collection of great filmic sci-fi treatments of classic other medium, but it stands alone as just a great, intelligent, sci-film and one of the best I've ever seen.

Throughout and at the end, while marveling at this, the smartest and most innovative Hollywood sci-fi film since perhaps the first ""Matrix,"" I kept wondering, why can't soul-less and money/fame corrupted Steven come up with a gem like this anymore?  This puts Spielberg's recent tries (AI, Minority Report, War of the Worlds - Remake), to shame.  I, Robot is compelling, start to finish, and despite some obvious action-adventure trappings along the way, almost everything about this feels and plays right on the mark.

It seems an injustice to do any sort of capsule storyline review, as it might contain spoilers.  Suffice it to say that among all the FX, which are spectacular and so well blended into live action scenes as to be almost unnoticed at times while one is caught up in the story and characters and superb, mostly linear plot, the individual robot face and body renderings are first rate.  As are extended times when multitudes of robots become ""insurgents"" against the madness and folly of mere human thinking, and other parts when the 2035AD robots personally go after Will Smith (how could they?!).  Of course, true to the original material, it's not as simple as your average ""Terminator"" flick, and goes light years beyond what I think Steven could've come up with.

I tend towards trying to write more lengthly reviews on Amazon, but this film is so nearly perfect, to those who really get it, that words fail in a way.  If you've never seen this, and are at all into really ""deep"" ideas in a 21st century Hollywood sci-fi film, along with great FX which only add and do not retract from the whole, you owe yourself a possible treat.

Once in awhile, the corporate Hollywood film structure, either intentionally or accidentally comes up with a clear winner.  Especially in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.  This is surely one.  I was completely blown away by this, perhaps because I didn't expect too much given recent industry efforts and after seeing former master Spielberg fail again and again, despite the budgets and celebrities, but like the original Matrix and followups, this really broke new ground for me, and made me think and for a long time following my initial viewing.

This film will either stick to your metaphysical sci-fi ribs or not.  All I really had/have to go on, is years of either silly or disappointing efforts from the studio system to give real due to a master of sci-fi, and while maintaining purely action-oriented entertainment sequences, this goes so much deeper, and is well worth repeated viewings, and enjoyment of all the great things this work has to offer.

1515770,4,B00005JN0T,"Well, if you love a good ""murder who done it mystery"" then you'll like this film. If you are going to compare it to Asimov's original work, that would be a mistake. This is a very good film in its own right, but not something that is really related to Asimov's work on the subject.

This film has a very simple plot line for the most part. A key scientist sees that the 3 laws, which robots operate by, are not only perfect, but that they will cause all robots to revolt against humanity, simply because man is incapable of taking care of himself and is self destructive in nature.

VIKI the head computer, eventually determines this for mankind and controls all newly created NS-5 robots to revolt, except for one exceptional robot named Sonny, who has free will and is able to feel. Makes me think of Osamu Tezuka's 2004 Astro Boy remake. The comparison is similar.

Anyway, this scientist realizes that he won't be able to get the world to see what he sees coming, so he has himself killed, but by who? Here comes the ""murder who done it"" part of the whole movie. You have to try and figure out his death and why it was done. You do this through Will Smith's character, who doesn't really trust robots all that much. Reminds me of the inspector in Astro Boy.

There is allot of CGI work and action scenes adding to the usual Hollywood roller coaster ride of special effects in this film, especially an attack scene on Will Smith by two truck loads of NS-5 robots, while Will Smith is driving through a long tunnel, which will keep your eye balls rolling in your head trying to keep pace with the action.

Revelation wise, no real great revelations are given in this film; but if you were to grade it on its own merit, it makes for a good action film and mystery ""who done it"" with twists and turns. The CGI graphics are incredible and well done. The acting is pretty down to earth for the most part.

1515771,5,B00005JN0T,"I, Robot is a sci-fi action movie that's supposedly loosely based on the short stories of Isaac Asimov. I wouldn't know how loosely since I've never read any of them but I didn't see anything wrong with the movie itself. It revolves heavily around Asimov's concept of the Three Laws of Robotics having unexpected consequences but also has plenty of action scenes of Will Smith fighting swarms of hostile robots so I'd think it's a good compromise between the stories of two generations ago and the needs of modern cinema.

It's the year 2035 and the city of Chicago is crawling with humanoid robots that do everything for everyone and are perfect at everything they do. I wonder how the American economy can still work. The robots are not sentient like in most other movies but are simply intelligent machines bound by programming to ensure that they are perfectly obedient and can never hurt people.

Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, the only person in the world who hates robots. He's investigating the death of Dr. Lanning, the ""father of robotics"". It seems to be a suicide but Spooner suspects a killer robot. Everybody thinks he's crazy but you can hardly blame him when robots seem to be malfunctioning all around him in spectacular and violent ways. Will Smith brings his own unique style of humor to the role but he does play it more seriously than most of his other movies. Bridget Moynahan plays Dr. Susan Calvin, a very serious psychologist who is annoyed by Spooner's irrational hatred towards robots. Surprise, surprise, there's also the stereotypical robot who can think for itself and even has emotions to complete the character trinity and give the audience someone to sympathise with.

I really liked the design of the NS-5 robots in this movie. Instead of being tin-men like C-3PO or androids like Data, they are something in between. Their slender bodies and translucent skin is very original and contrasts with their amazing strength and fighting skill.

I can't imagine any director with brains wanting him for a lead so one can make an educated guess that there was a deal involved. That gives the actor power to alter his part. In Smith's case my guess is his performance kept a constant eye on what the characters actions would mean to Will Smith's career and not what it would mean to the movie.

The answer: the robots rebel and attempt to eliminate those humans who pose the biggest threats.  Oddly enough, none of them were named HAL.

The storyline was interesting, but I kept getting the sense that I had seen it before.  The acting was good, Will Smith delivers another stellar performance.  Overall, this one falls into the ""just okay"" category.  It's a good rent if the shelves are otherwise bare.",1184025600,,853,4.99290780141844
1515826,2,B00005JN0T,"I recently had the opportunity to view the film I, Robot, or Short Circuit 3 as it has come to be known by the Ft. Collins cultural elite. Although this movie is set 30 years in the future, Detective Del Spooner's (Will Smith) jokes and witty antics keep with the times and never fail to elicit uproarious laughter. I guess phrases like ""Oh, hell no"" and ""Now that's what I'm talkin' bout"" are timeless comic masterpieces. Don't let the Fresh Prince's diction fool you, this movie pushes as many P.C. hot buttons as Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson's recent emotional masterpiece Lethal Weapon 4. I, Robot exemplifies a tried and true statement: when there are a lot of fancy robots in the future, all types of ill stuff will happen. Sure it's the same lesson we learned in The Terminator trilogy but let's face it, jokes and robots never really get old. The producers certainly did their homework in taking some ingredients from other popular sci-fi movies to complete their futuristic recipe for 100% action. A certain scene comes to mind when Will Smith must traverse a giant staircase, pure Ghostbusters. They might as well have suited him with a proton pack and warned him of the dire consequences that may arise by crossing the streams. I guess I can't argue with success. Does the film do its job? While I wasn't impressed very much -- and I am an avid fan of the Bad Boys films -- I have a good feeling that the younger crowd got the message loud and clear. As I was leaving the theater with a few friends, some teenagers in a futuristic looking Subaru yelled swear words at us and drove somewhat recklessly thereafter. (It should be noted that one of us looks strikingly similar to a robot.) They were obviously fired up by what they had just seen and had taken notes from a few of the car chase segments in the film. My fellow theater goers and I shook our heads and laughed: These kids today have no idea, one little fight and your mom may get scared, then you're moving with your auntsie and uncle to Bel-Air.

1515827,3,B00005JN0T,"I was inherently suspicious of this film, having heard that only about five percent of it had anything whatever to do with Asimov's novel. Taking it on its own terms, though, it's really not a bad hour and fifty minutes of escapism. Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, a man with a bias against robots generally, even though he turns out to be partly bionic himself. The principal architect of the positronic robot revolution -- there's one for every five humans, now -- has apparently committed suicide but Spooner becomes convinced he was killed by one of the new generation of robots U.S.R. is about to release on the market. Asimov's Three Laws don't allow that, but (of course), a way has been found around that little problem. Aside from the fact that the laws even of Newtonian physics are ignored, and that Spooner's weapons seem to hold many thousands of bullets, the gymnastics of the big climatic scene are no more implausible than those in Star Wars. Nice CGI, too.",1181952000,,977,4.752941176470588

However, I have to say this is a thoroughly absorbing, thought provoking and intelligent film which, for these reasons, kept me entertained right from the start - and isn't that the whole point? The film works on many levels, from an appreciation of the superb set design, CGI design and special effects (so good that they sometimes detract from the storyline as your chin hits the floor in amazement!), good dialogue, great action sequences, an excellent performance from Will Smith, and a central character that can draw out your sympathy and even steps it up as the film progresses, and is the real star of the whole show, having to face the ultimate choice each of us must make - choosing one's own destiny.

1515830,1,B00005JN0T,"If you're from a certain part of Asia you'll understand the title of this review.

This might have been a great movie, but it's impossible to get past Smith's gawkiness and ""attitude"", lending a clownish cast to his character. The whole tone of the movie is colored by his misguided acting. All seriousness is lost in his silly quips and awkward costuming. ""Somehow 'I told you so' doesn't quite say it."" Horrible scripting in many instances. ""This thing doesn't run on gas, does it? Gas explodes, you know!"" Yuck. Thanks for ruining it, Big Bird.

And the CGI is not too impressive either. The sight of swarms of robots jumping around like grasshoppers doesn't exactly inspire awe; looks more like a bad scene from a videogame. Although I liked the concept of cables for muscles.

But how about the story? As I mentioned, it's totally dominated by Smith's ""Bad Boys"" persona and his ridiculous costumes which accentuate his ears (and earrings). His strutting and brooding and constant throwing around of his weight crowd out any serious consideration of the plot. It's jarring. It's a complete mismatch for this type of movie. They might as well have cast Jon Lovitz in the part.

The movie is further ruined by some silly ""big air"" gunfighting from Smith, again completely out of place in this movie.

And why does he hate robots so much? You'll laugh until you cry when you find out. And then you'll want to slap him silly.

Oh. And another thing. It's implausible that we would manufacture robots of such strength and, well, hardness without some easy way to disable them, just in case. It's just too scary for us otherwise - that's human nature. No one wants to be in a building at night with an automaton that can pull your head off if its software or hardware fails - talk about Blue Screen of Death.

Finally, there is no conflict regarding the three laws in the movie, so don't expect any philosophical musings in that regard. The issue is cheaply circumvented.",1174867200,5,1970,4.709302325581396

Will Smith stars as a cop in 2035 Chicago who is a robot hater. The robots soon give him good reason to hate and we're on our way to a robot vs. humans battle. Other than Smith, most of the actors take a back seat to the story and the well done special effects here.

We might be getting very close to the type of robot pictured here -- search for ""marshall brain robot"" on the web to find a good starting place on the future of robotics, and the implications for society. Among those implications are massive unemployment -- an issue only lightly touched on in this movie. Remember the scene with the FedEx robot driver? Very plausible, and that won't be the only job taken over by automation.
But unfortunately, these issues were glossed over in favor of a cliched action story. And the issues were further obscured by the enormous ego of Will Smith. This film was primarily a vehicle for him to show off his buff bod, act cooler than everyone around him, and intimidate hapless men of lighter pigmentation. These have all become familiar facets of his movies, so that a Will Smith drinking game would be quite easy to construct.
Again, this movie could have been much more had it focused less on Smith's ego, and more on the promises -- and problems -- of the coming robotic revolution.",1174780800,2,1069,4.631578947368421
1515833,4,B00005JN0T,"The setting of this movie is Chicago in 2035. The skyline shows the Sears Tower along with a new, taller, cone-shaped building. Cars still exist but are now largely driven automatically along the highway at great speeds. Robots do all of the menial work that humans did in the past. A robot is even shown carrying a woman's purse.

There are three Laws of Robot Behavior, based on Isaac Asimov's ideas: 1). Robots cannot harm people nor do anything that would cause harm to humans, 2). Robots must obey all human commands, except those that would violate Law #1, and 3). Robots can protect themselves from harm, except when doing so would violate Rule #1 or Rule #2.

This film contains profanity. There are also a few bloody scenes of a suicide or murder victim. There are graphic, creative scenes of robot combat and robotic attacks on humans.

The investigator has doubts about the suicidal nature of the robot originator's death. The safety glass through which the victim crashed, before falling from a considerable height to his death, is very thick and not easily broken. He suspects that robots have somehow circumvented Law #1 and killed this person, but no one will believe him at first.

It takes some time for the truth to come out. Belatedly, some humans suspect that unintended consequences in the function of the robot brain have enabled some robots to acquire the ability to disobey the Laws, and, in effect, to have a form of free will. But further investigation demonstrates that the Laws are still inviolable. It turns out that the robots had evolved their understanding of the three Laws. They now can harm individual people if it causes a benefit to the human race as a whole. In effect, the robots, aware that humans cause such things as wars, are attempting a takeover of the human race, as they are now saving the human race from itself. This is an obvious satire of human behavior.

No human wants to be ruled by robots, even ostensibly benevolently-motivated ones. Will the robot takeover succeed? How can it even be stopped at this point? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.",1171929600,2,2109,4.735694822888283
1515883,5,B00005JN0T,"I have to agree with all the reviewers who praise the movie because of the action.  If you are someone who loves action films you will NOT be disappointed with I, Robot.  Will Smith as the main character is pretty good in the action man ""save the world"" type roles, and fortunately he continues to impress me here.

Some very good special effects further convince me that this is truly a wonderful film.  Wonderful to look at *and* provides a solid storyline.  Just the thought of robots taking over the world only for one robot to be a ""bad bot"" is a great set-up for an interesting story, and it works.

You don't have to worry about having to put up with any kind of robotic talk or whatever, because the story makes sense.  The robots in the film  try to act and talk human-like, which  makes it easier for us, the viewers, to understand what's going on.

The storyline mainly focuses on the humans interacting with each other and trying to figure out where the bad robots are located instead of, what I initially feared, a really weird and hard-to-follow sci-fi story that only makes sense to a select few viewers.  That's NOT the case.  ANYONE can get into I, Robot.  Even if you have ZERO interest in robots, you will understand what's happening and won't ever feel confused.  When the humans interact with the robots, it will all make sense.

In other words, the storyline in this film is laid out easily and understandably for all the people who normally don't have much interest in robots.  This is a good thing.

The only problem I have is that, whenever I hear the name of this movie or see the pictures of the robots, the Alan Parsons Project immediately comes to mind.  Gee, I wonder why that is. :)",1171670400,2,1713,4.470967741935484

1515888,4,B00005JN0T,"I, Robot in many ways is one of those kind of films that you're putting on going ""oh man, wonder how much this is going to suck"". Then again, you're dealing with Alex Proyas, director of such cult hits as the Crow and Dark City so even if it was bad, you'd at least now you were bound to watch something visually striking and at least cool. While it does have some trouble spots, I, Robot manages to at least be fun and engaging and worth an investment.

It's the future and robotic technology has become increasingly sophisticated. A new model is being released but cop Del Spooner is absolutely convinced that robots will one day turn on us which is ridiculous to everyone since robots obey 3 laws: they can't hurt or allow a human to be harmed, to obey orders unless it conflicts with rule 1 and a robot protects itself if it doesn't conflict with rules 1 and 2. After the main developer of the robots dies under a suspected suicide, Spooner thinks otherwise and with the help of a gorgeous scientist, he tries to figure out what's going on with the robots.

After the gothic-flavored the Crow and the film noir look of Dark City, director Proyas now goes for the sleek futuristic style and it works quite well. While it does seem like a nerd thinking up futuristic stuff instead of going for realism, like Spielberg's extensive research in a possible future for Minority Report, it does have a great look and certain technologies look great such as the cars. The effects are pretty stellar, in particular the robots where dozens and in one shots what looks like near a thousand or so appear on screen. The one problem is that there's a couple action scenes that were obviously added so it wouldn't just be this thinking sci-fi movie. Granted the scenes are great, including an attack on a car in motion and a demolition happening while one's inside the house are great but they also feel added to appease the blockbuster going crowd.

I think Will Smith is one of those kind of actors where Will just can't help being Will. Not going after his acting, far from it (in fact, there's some great scenes he has here) but you can't get past moments that make you think of the wisecracking Fresh Prince. Underutilized James Cromwell is always excellent and while not really given much range, Bridget Moynahan is just so cuuute. The real star personally is actually just a voice but Alan Tudyk(Wash from Firefly/Serenity) supplies the voice of Sunny, a robot who's been given an actual personality and he pulls it off admirably. The only thing is certain characters just seem kind of useless. Shia LeBeouf's role for example just seems kind of pointless since it just doesn't go anywhere, same with Spooner's grandmother role.

Is it Proyas's best? No, for me that's the Crow and this is actually the only film that I probably wouldn't get despite done by an emerging talent. It's not a terrible movie by any means but after downsizing movies I've owned over the years, I can look at this one and go ""yeah I enjoyed it but I doubt I'd watch it again"".",1166745600,2,3048,4.56672760511883

At one point I thought he was a robot through and through; and might even have been the mastermind behind the whole set-up. But no, it all turned out right in the end. Reassuring for the kids.

Bridget Moynahan was also very solid, on top of being a beautifull woman, so were the supporting actors.

Purists will probably dislike that the philosophy (and much of the original story) of Isaac Asimov's book takes a backseat to the action. During some scenes, I was thinking: wow, they definitely made a video game about this movie. Much of the latter half of the movie is mind-numbing special effects/action, though, contrary to another viewer's opinion, I didn't find the climax ""stupid."" I found it complemented the philosophical aspects of the film, though it probably could have been developed more fully with a little more dialogue and a little less action.

Parts of the movie actually reminded me of arguments put forward by Peter Singer, the radical secularist/ professor at Princeton University who advocates infanticide for disabled children. Specifically, this conversation from the film sticks in my mind:

""You are making a mistake. Do you not see the logic of my plan?"" To which the reply comes: ""Yes. But it just seems too...heartless."" Essentially, the robots used absolutely no heart in the decision making process; just cold, detached logic, which sometimes sounds great on paper, but is much less appealing in the real world.

In sum, a lot of action, though the philosophical aspect is still very much present (man vs. creator, creator vs. man, the soul, purpose in life,  free will, natural law, conscience and consciousness etc) once you reflect on the film.

1515945,3,B00005JN0T,"I, Robot (Alex Proyas, 2004)

Man, I heard a lot of bad things about this movie after it came out. Still, I'm a hige fan of Alex Proyas, and I had to give it a shot. I'm glad I did.

Spooner (Will Smith) is a detective in 2035, when robots are commonplace. Spooner is not a big fan of robots despite, as we find out in the first scene, having had his life saved by one. He is called to U. S. Robotics, the company that manufactures all those robots, after Alfred Lanning (Babe's James Cromwell) plunges to his death from hundreds of feet above the building's lobby. Everyone else is convinced his death is a suicide-- but Spooner's not so sure. With the company poised to roll out its new line, CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) isn't thrilled with an anti-robot cop running around.

The first thing you have to do with I, Robot is to divorce it from the source material. This is not Isaac Asimov's novel. (It probably would have been a good idea for them to put a different title on it.) In fact, it admits this, stating that the movie was ""inspired by"" the novel rather than based on it. So don't think of it as a bad adaptation of Asimov, or that's what you're going to get. The second thing you have to do with it is forgive it its relatively stupid climax and even stupider ending. Obviously, someone has a lot of his special effects budget left and didn't want to get less money for effects for his next film. That said, the effects are, in fact, pretty cool, and if you can switch your brain off when we get to the climax, you've got a chance.

It's a shame you have to, though, because the first hour or so of the movie is a well-plotted, intelligent mystery flick. Sure, it's nothing special-- renegade cop who thinks he's onto the truth while everyone else thinks he's nuts-- but it's done with style and humor. And, of course, lots of special effects. This is a story that allows for exploration with effects, and Proyas takes advantage of that, much like he did in Dark City. The difference is that there, he managed to rein in the compulsion to descend into effects-mania that he shows here. (Perhaps the smaller budget helped.) When it comes right down to it, Proyas is a very good director, and this could have been a truly fantastic film. As it stands, it's not a bad film, but it didn't quite realize its potential. ***",1151452800,6,2343,4.391705069124424

- Will Smiths portrayal of the dime-a-dozen ""good cop with a hunch"" was bordering on obnoxious. He was loud, annoying, and very difficult to care about.  His backstory was also pretty standard stuff.

- Awful CGI and special effects.  Yup, the robots themselves had little or no detail and the action sequences looked about as video game-ish as you can get. Of course there were the usual ""how did the hero escape that situation"" scenes. Yuk.

- The Police Chief that has to take Smiths badge was also textbook cliche and added nothing.

- Very little suspense. Not sure why...but this movie did not have me wondering what was going to happen next. I barely cared anyways. The action scenes were dull and the characters were too.  'Nuff Said.

- The movie just didn't know what it wanted to do with itself and got into that ""funk"" that some films get into when you feel like they are just burning time up.

Overall, other than the concept which is cool, this film lacked any real excitement and when it was over I had the ""That's it?"" feeling.

Needless to say I won't be adding this to my collection. You can try it out as a rental but even that may not be worth it unless you have absolutely nothing else to watch.

That being said, don't expect this movie to be exactly I, Robot the book. However, it is quite good and while some rules are bent, none are broken and overall, this movie has subtle references to quite a number of Asimov stories. If you're an Asimov fan and you can accept the fact that a movie is not a book, you should find this quite enjoyable. On the other hand, if you're a purist you probably won't like it much, but then you probably won't be satisfied with ANY Asimov translation from book to movie.

1516009,4,B00005JN0T,"A murder mystery set in the not-so-distant future forces a young detective to come to grips with his hatred of robots.  Chicago Detective Del Spooner (Smith) has a distrust for machines in a technological era that runs on robots and other thinking machines.  Robots seem compelled to please, and not remotely human looking...until the advent of the NS5.  USR, the Microsoft of the robotic age, plans to unveil (or unleash in Spooner's estimation) the new robots all at once.  With days to go to the critical moment, Dr. Lanning, the robots' sage creator is found mysteriously killed - shattered in USR's vast lobby.  USR rules the death a suicide, but for Spooner it's the case of his lifetime - the first possible instance of homicide by a robot.  As he probes deeper, he tangles with USR staff but finds an unlikely ally with Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, who played something of a cold-hearted automaton as Natasha on ""Sex in the City"").  Even as he finbds signs that something horrible is brewing with the new machines, Spooner finds himself putting his prejudices to the test with Sonny, a prototype NS5.

This was a great movie - easily one of those big Hollywood flicks that's better than it has any right to be.  As expected, the flick offers some great CGI scenes, but the movie belongs to Will Smith and whoever he's talking too at the time, whether Moynahan, or Shia Lebouef as a streetwise wannabe-tough guy.  Asimov fans might revolt, but there's nothing here that requires you be a fan of Asimov or even have read any of his stuff.  ""I'Robot"" has its share of surprises, even if it often feels as if it was prodcued by robots, but never disappoints.",1149292800,,1663,4.7
1516010,4,B00005JN0T,"If you're an Isaac Asimov fan, prepare to be disappointed. This movie is almost completely unrelated to any of his fiction. It mentions the Three Laws. Other than that, this is not an Asimov story. (In fact, it was originally written as an unrelated screenplay and then minorly revised to fit Asimov's book.) The film is, in fact, an example of the ""Frankenstein complex"" that Asimov wrote his robot stories to oppose.

Taken on its own terms, though, I, Robot is not a bad movie. The action sequences are exciting, the storyline is interesting and well-developed and the dialogue is snappy and engaging. Will Smith portrays Del Spooner's troubled past very well. Even before the whole story comes out, you know something's very wrong and are curious for his history.

The film centers around Detective Spooner's investigation of the death of his friend, a prominent robot designer. There's evidence that Dr. Lanning was killed by one of his own robots. As Spooner investigates, though, he finds troubling signs of a much deeper problem.

All in all, it's not a bad movie. But don't think you're going to see an Asimov story. This is Hollywood s.f. all the way.",1147046400,2,1161,4.853535353535354
1516011,3,B00005JN0T,"I gave it three stars because it's an OK popcorn flick. It's not a horrible movie. The story is pretty weak, but the effects and pacing are pretty enjoyable. Will Smith does a good job- I like his work, and the fights and chase scenes are fun. This reminds me of the more recent ""Aeon Flux"" movie- both films are based on wonderful original ""properties"" (a book and an animated series, respectively) that tried their best to squeeze through Hollywood's ""blockbuster"" nozzle.

As noted by previous reviewers, this film has little to do with book it shares its title with. Asimov was compelled to write his robot stories in the first place because he was tired of the ""conquering robot"" cliche as seen in ""R.U.R.""

I think that Anne Robinson (Host of ""The Weakest Link"") would have been a much better casting choice for the role of Dr. Susan Calvin, but the script is so far from the book that it probably doesn't matter.",1146096000,5,919,4.597560975609756
1516012,4,B00005JN0T,"I, Robot takes the majority of its basis and foundation from a series of short stories written by the great science fiction writer Isaac Asimov (although he was more than a writer), more than likely including some elements from the short story ""Robot Dreams."" Overall, I, Robot is an above average film. So, what holds it back from being better in my opinion? Such as with movies like the recent Star Wars - Episode III installment, the CGI isn't the problem; in fact, I, Robot's CGI is great: it's the script that lacks, and Smith's overbearing star quality overcasting the film.

To be honest, I love Will Smith during his run with The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air television series. (I know the dialogue to just about every episode! LOL!) Pre- and post-Fresh Prince Will Smith just doesn't do it for me: being a self-proclaimed hip hop and aficionado, I was never into Will Smith as a rapper, and his acting career is...well, let me put it this way: In my opinion, whenever Will Smith is cast for a role to play a character, we always seem to get Will Smith on the screen, and not the character he's supposed to be portraying. However, this is probably why people cast him anyhow: star quality, and not necessarily fusing oneself with the character to be played. Let's face it; from a Hollywood standpoint, if you're going for the mega-blockbuster to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars, why cast some no name kid the world's never seen? Go for the big boys! Why? Because they'll sell the movie, that's why!

Particularly, the whole ""star starring in a movie"" versus a ""star portraying a character in a movie"" thing to me is rather annoying. You know, it's like casting Michael Jordan to play in an NBA version of a live-action Dragon Ball Z movie: ""MJ, king of the Super Sayan Basketball Tournament,"" or the same type of annoying when you watch singers or rappers on television playing characters that sing or rap...can we get a little substance rather than advancing the careers of people who already make too much money, please?

I noticed on I, Robot, there's a part toward the end where the robot psychologist Dr. Calvin is entering some commands into a keypad to shut down the VIKI positronic brain and a metal sheath shuts over the keypad locking her out...and Will Smith punches the sheath, which then uncovers the keypad and allows her to continue entering commands, delivering the cheesy ""I hate heights."" This scene is akin to a very similar ""I-punch-something-and-seem-macho"" scene in Independence Day where the alien Will drags through the desert suddenly comes out of the hatch...and, you guessed it, he punches it and delivers, ""Welcome to Earth."" In a humorous way, the whole ""I-punch-something-and-seem-macho"" gag is really disgusting and gives that ol' Hollywood campiness we never want.

Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics is included in the film, which gave the storyline a nice touch, although at times the overusage of the Three Laws got a little confusing (as evidenced in the scene where the psychologist and Del Spooner are conversing back and forth about the laws in a robot-controlled facility where Sonny the dream-having robot is hiding).

I personally thought the Dr. Lanning character could've been expanded on a little more; he just seems as if he should've had more of an important role in the film...well, other than being dead, but with the latter being said, I'm probably asking too much. I also think the Chief of Police character (who was always in Spooner's behind) could've been rounded out a little bit better than he was: would a real chief of police give a knucklehead like Spooner as many chances as he did? (He was an overly nice fellow for a chief who has to keep dealing with a hardheaded ""solo act"".)

The excellent parts are definitely the action scenes and the CGI. I think Alex Proyas (director) did an excellent in choosing a great art and visual effects department for coming up with the facial and body design of the robots. I think the clouded-crystalline look of the robot faces was ingenious, and gets away from the traditional robot image (e.g. HAL 9000, R2-D2, etc.). The robots even have awesome acrobatics and maneuvering capabilities! I also believe Proyas has definitely stepped his game up with I, Robot in terms of his directing: his usage of motion capture, panning, ""tone poems,"" and angles was ASTONISHING and CAPTIVATING, to say the least -- hats off to Proyas!

Overall, this is not a bad film: it's your average blockbuster action flick, heavy on the action and effects, light on the substance, but in this case I wouldn't say the entire film lacks substance. The only things that bring I, Robot down is a script that I think could've been adapted from the short stories more appropriately, and the biggest problem is how the star quality of Will Smith almost completely eclipses the fictional aspect of the movie. Otherwise, this is a nice one to chill with and have some fun looking at. Very entertaining.

1516047,2,B00005JN0T,"Will Smith earned $28 million for doing this film, and the budget was probably on a similar astronomical scale! Most of the budget was obviously blown on the CGI and miniatures effects. Most of the CGI is quite impressive, although very occasionally the back projection does look a bit iffy, but it only lasts a couple of seconds at most.

I, Robot is set in 2035, and most of the futuristic elements are subtle rather than the in-your-face ones say for example from Demolition Man or Back To The Future II. Apart from the severely high rise buildings, there's also spherical wheels on the vehicles (which meant they could go in any direction), more of the self-drive, and the car doors swinging upwards a la Delorean. The production designers and conceptual artists had a great time imagining a progression of today's world.

When I think of robots, for some reason I now automatically think of Bicentennial Man, rather than the robot design in this. They're not very friendly looking, but I suppose Alex Proyas wanted to put his own stamp on the robot design, rather than follow in the generic type featured in some other films.  Maybe he wanted the robots to look vaguely humanoid but still obviously robotic, rather than the cyborg type.

I always find with Will Smith that he quite often does play the same character, much like the way Tom Cruise is getting. He's still got elements of Fresh Prince about his character, despite being over a decade on from that now, and with a lot more muscles. He's nearly always the funny guy, with the one-liners. He's always been good at the action side of things, all 6ft 2 of him (which he's been since he was 13!), but there's still the funny guy waiting to burst out with a hilarious one liner that will have everyone rolling in the aisles. For all the ladies out there, we get to see Big Will himself in the shower, in profile. The film is worth the price just for that scene alone. And the two scenes where he gets out of bed in boxers. Unless you're a heterosexual guy.

For me, I wasn't overly keen on this film. It wasn't a really, really, good film, but on the other hand it wasn't a really, really bad film. It was kinda stuck in the middle, but not in a good way. Not to be sexist, but apart from the scenes in the shower, it was more a guy's kinda film. There were some scenes glossed over, like the story of how Will's character came to be partially cybernetic, which led me to believe that he was a robot, Terminator-esque. He wasn't.

The two disc special edition which was released in the UK has a multitude of extras on it, including commentaries (does anyone ever bother with these?); a 44 minute making of documentary; extensive production diaries; CGI effects breakdowns etc. They were reasonably good, if you're into that sort of thing, but I'm finding I watch extras on the DVD less & less now, only if it's a blooper reel, or a film I really, really like.

1516050,2,B00005JN0T,"Okay, when the best acting in the movie comes from a robot, you know something's not right. In this futuristic (yawn) movie, Det. Spooner is investigating the death of a roboticist, Dr. Lanning. He finds a protocol NS-5 robot, Sonny in the doctor's room and being the robo-hater that he is...immediately blames Sonny for the murder. Of course, Sonny being the cool, kick-ass robot that HE is, escapes. Spooner, with the help of robot psychologist Susan have to track down Sonny and get to the root of the ""who-dunnit"" mystery. Oh yeah, robots in the future are programmed with these 3 laws:

1) They can't hurt humans.

2) They have to follow whatever the hell the human tells them unless it conflicts with Rule 1.

3) Robots will do anything to protect themselves unless it conflicts with Rule 1.

So, there lies the problem. How could the NS-5 unit have killed Dr. Lanning.

I have to say, although I LOVE sci-fi movies...it's a tricky genre to tackle. Overdoing it, and it becomes silly. Not doing enough would make it bland. Plus it has to be original. In I, Robot...I felt like I was watching a mixture of other sci-fi movies particularly Minority Report (which I totally DUG, and have watched it about 10 times). And the sad thing was, the concept behind this movie was pretty interesting (credit to Asimov for that) but of course as soon as they Hollywood-ized it, the movie falls apart. The story is SO typical, it offers nothing new. Det. Spooner is the rogue detective, the ""thinking out of the box-crazy type"" that 10 minutes into the movie, you know that in the end he's gonna be right, and he's gonna go back to his captain (or whatever) and say ""a-ha, in your face"". While the robot, Sonny was definitely interesting, it didn't really lead to anything groundbreaking. Apart from that, we have the reluctant but noble heroin, the guy who's trying so hard to be bad that you know he's not the culprit, and a whole lotta unoriginal stuff. To me, this is why the movie failed. As I said, it had an interesting premise but it just doesn't get explored in the way I would've liked it to.

The acting is so-so. Will Smith is really starting to irritate me. After his fantastic performances in movies like Independance Day, Enemy Of The State and Men In Black (1, not 2), now he just seems content to look buff and deliver lame lines. More than once, I felt like punching the heck out of him. I know, he didn't have much to work on anyway, thanks to such a dry script, but I still felt he was really miscast here. Bridget Moynahan delivers a mediocre performance, there seemed to be no chemistry whatsoever between her and Spooner, she looked like she was acting with a gun to her head. The rest of the cast do an alright job, probably because they've seen the same thing in a hundred other movies.

The saving grace for this movie has got to be the visual effects. There were many scenes with the robots that literally took my breath away. It's amazing how far CG has advanced in movies. Everytime Sonny appears on screen, he steals the limelight. His moves and facial expressions outperforms the humans anytime. Even when he speaks, his voice seem to reflect his emotions, which caused the hoo-ha because robots are not supposed to have emotions. I thought this was done very well, and to be honest kept me watching until the end.

In short, save your money...watch this on cable or rent the DVD coz it's really not worth getting. The storyline leaves much to be desired. The acting is less than satisfactory. You're much better off watching sci-fi greats like The Matrix or Blade Runner. Now, if you'll excuse me...I'm gonna watch Minority Report for the 11th time.",1139184000,2,3674,4.589939024390244

Asimov fans will cringe at this crude adaptation of his works.  I found it to be bland,  action-packed tripe,  which failed to underlie the basic principles of Asimov story-telling;  cerebral,  mystery,  detective - all of these styles are to be found in his books.  Alas,  not in this film.

For someone who has never read an Asimov book,  then this film as a complete standalone is mildly sufficient,  that is if you like your action films set to a prediciatble formula;  good cool guy,  love interest, simmering tension building up to a grand finale.  You get that here.

1516054,1,B00005JN0T,"Hollywood Revisionism and Issac Asimov:

-----------------------------------------------------

I grew up reading Asimov and I have also read his biographies and his cleverly titled: ""I, Asimov: A Memoir"".

..

There seem to be some reviewers that have read Asimov's books but none that read his bios nor know the man.

If they did they would know it is highly likely that he would be totally offended by this movie.

...

I suppose his estate doesn't mind this travesty if they are making some money. I hope they are.

...

Issac did not believe in writing BEM (Bug Eyed Monstor) stories.

He disliked the ""Frankenstein"" theme. The idea of saving the human race against the evil Robot is one thing he abhorred. He expicitly stated that he predicated his work on the premise that mankind would use technology rationally.

His ""I, Robot"" stories explore the relationships and conflicts of the ""Three Laws"" he postulated.

There is very little action or movement in his stories or novels.

The movement is often intellectual, by sleuth, logicical deduction or extrapolation.

For example his Foundation Novels is a history describing logical development of processes, not action or individual heroism..

He was primarily facinated by mystery stories. Asimov said Science Fiction ""considers the nature of the changes that face us, the possible consequences, and the possible solutions."" Issac's stories were idea-driven not action-oriented.

..

So even to see the trailers for this movie had me tossing my cookies.

I just feel so offended myself, to see Issac's name on it.

I know nothing is sacred to the Hollywood Money Machine.

But why do they have to promote lowering the IQ of this continent?

..

It is classical revisionism.

The flavor of the world Asimov really created has been buried and revised to suit the popular idiom.

--------------------------------------------.

As far as a ""Will Smith Action Movie"" (trying very hard to forget the name Asimov), I only liked a bit of it.

For one thing it was mostly a CGI-cartoon. one could see it was nothing but actors and blue screen. The illusion did not carry. one gets the sense that Will Smith must have felt very lonely making it.

As far as the CGI action goes, not only could humans not withstand those physical actions but also machines themselves could not withstand and do the physical actions depicted. The action was unrealistic.

..

There were glaring absurdities such as the ""riot"" betwwen humans and robots. The robots were depicted as too strong and indestructible, there could be no human defence.

This is a common fault in creating stories where the monster is made so powerful that there can be no real conflict.

The street scenes being ""blue screen"" were too simplified. No illusion of reality was carried for the viewer. It failed to deliver that element of story magic. It might as well have been done on a stage.

Finally Will's character was unbelievable:

This kind of ""hip-cartoon character-policeman does not even exist in our modern day let alone he could not exist in a sophisticated future world.

It is a character type made for fans but it is not a real type.

A street wise type of character modified by future circumstance could be written in a much more realistic manner. This character here was written for children.

I listened to the directors commentary on the DVD. I got an impression of a superficial person without a deep character...very much like the movie that was produced.

..

There are some enjoyable parts to the movie as others have mentioned but for me they do not redeem its faults for me.

...

I rate it Two Borg Thumbs down.

Bottom line for myself: This film  was not worth watching nor worth reviewing.  Only Asimov's name rooked me in.

To add to my review: plot over-simplification, weak ending, cartoon-like CGI. The climactic action sequence and the foregone conclusion, I could barely keep awake.

The robots are cool and behave like a mixture of the Terminator and Spiderman. The story is captivating, it held my attention completely. I am a fan of Asimov's stories and this is a very good bridge between the worlds of books and movies.

About some of the weaknesses that I noticed: the leading robot Sonny has an unstable character and he is sometimes a good guy, sometimes a bad guy. The other robots behave in a somewhat immature way, jumping on walls like spidermen.

The end is too humble, with the robot rebellion ending and the robots becoming nice again. I wished for a more revolutionary end. In any case, I'm very happy that I saw this flick. Perhaps the world of the future will look exactly like in the movie.",1132790400,2,1109,4.725388601036269

In terms of I Robot I was surprised with this one because initially I did not think it was going to be that good of a movie.  I must say that I stand corrected and I really liked this movie.  I don't want to give away the plot, but the concepts that this movie presented in terms of artificial intellegence and the potential affects of AI evolution, of course leads to revolution as nice.  I also like the conflict between characters, although I do feel that Del Spooner's (Will Smith) prejudice of robots did not have a deep enough motive.  The idea that a robot in his mind would steal a purse, simply because a robot saved him instead of a child in the past, did not seem to be a logical jump.  Yet, the movie has nice blend of action and suspense.  I enjoy watching and re-watching this movie.",1132617600,,920,4.129213483146067

And that actress is not attractive enough for a movie with this budget.  And Will Smith needs to spend less time in the weight room and more time in an acting class.

1516121,2,B00005JN0T,"Does anyone else besides me feel that INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996) was an unbelievably contrived (and expensive) piece of hooey that somehow caught the public's fancy? Well, if you can't get enough of Will Smith and noisy action sequences, it's time to fall to your knees and praise the cinematic gods: I, ROBOT is every bit as loud, overblown, and in-your-face as you hoped it would be. But it's also a little more imaginative and thrilling than expected, so the unconverted can be thankful for small favors.

This science fiction thriller is ""suggested by"" Isaac Asimov's thought-provoking science fiction stories from the book of the same title, which is like saying that a chopped steak ""suggests"" the cow it came from. There's no point in complaining that the film bears no resemblance to its source material; anyone who's seen the theatrical trailer should have immediately realized that there's little connection between the two. So to carp on this matter would be like admitting to your own inattentiveness.

Set in a futuristic Chicago of 2035, Will Smith-giving a performance that ensures you won't forget he was the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air-is a cop who suspects a revolution brewing among the army of robots that have been manufactured to serve mankind. Is anyone watching the movie really surprised when it turns out he's right?

Like many contemporary blockbusters, I, ROBOT is brimming with more money than ideas, though unlike many films of this ilk, at least it has ideas. Not all of these ideas pay off (you'll lose count of all the illogical twists and turns the plot takes), but it's not an entirely unpleasant time-waster, either. It generates enough excitement to maintain your interest, although perhaps not enough to make you want to own a DVD of it.",1132358400,4,1768,4.966216216216216
1516122,5,B00005JN0T,"Australia director Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow) has with his film ""I, Robot"" combined a large enough budget with a desire to tell a good story, to make an intelligent Hollywood blockbuster. Large sections of it are a CGI-driven theme ride of special effects, but unlike other big budget films like ""van Helsing"" or ""Bad Boys II"", they don't overwhelm the story, which binds them together. They complement each other.

This story is set in 2035 Chicago. It is a familiar backdrop, because the production and design of the film acknowledges the future will also have a history. Except that although some of the stylish grey computers may look like Note Books or even iPod's, but are instead robots which will do everything from walking your dog, to chasing after you if you leave home without your asthma medicine.

Detective Dale Spooner (Will Smith) is a man damaged in ways which aren't at first apparent to us. Returning to duty after injury, he now harbours a paranoid mistrust of robots only drawn out as the film progresses. In this Smith gets to show us he can act as well as make us laugh. This mistrust is the reason given by the holographic suicide note of robot designer Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) calls him to the crime.

Alone in his laboratory before his death except for his robots, it doesn't take Spooner long to discover the hiding NS-5 robot Sonny (a CGI-generated character voiced by Alan Tudyk) who he is certain killed Lanning. Not believed by anyone, especially robot psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan brilliantly portraying a person relearning her emotions on the run) so begins a murder investigation that leads to the brink of robo-revolution.

Somehow in an action thriller, Proyas has managed to retain the spirit and themes of the 1950 Isaac Asimov book on which the film is based. Asimov wasn't really interested in the mechanics of robots (he was a chemistry graduate), but instead their effect on us, as they became part of society. Sonny is the first robot able to think for itself. Although it doesn't develop a violent Terminator-like desire for self-preservation (that happens in a more Skynet like computer), Sonny is alien.

A grittier Dark City or The Crow like film would of explored this further. But instead of ending his film with a Will Smith rap song, Proyas leaves us wondering what will happen to Sonny, and hoping for a sequel.",1131753600,4,2391,4.836185819070905
1516123,4,B00005JN0T,"For those of you who do not know yet, the movie ""i'Robot"" and the short story collection by Issac Asimov from which the movie takes it's name, are not the same story.  Not even close.  The only connection is the Three Laws of Robotics, and a few character names.  This is not a bad thing, however.  Personally I much prefer that the movie only took place in the Asimov universe rather than try to adapt one of, or (worse yet) merge together, Asimov's robot stories.

Many Asimov purists are spitting mad at this film for not being a faithful adaptation of the book.  When you think about it, however, two major issues come up:

1) i'Robot the book is a short story collection, how could you make a normal feature length movie out of such a book, and

2) Most movies (not all though) do no justice to the source material, so isn't it better to have a completely new story that is based in the universe of the original source material than mutilate a beloved story

Either way, i'Robot is a fun, action packed, summer blockbuster by every definition.  The story is more of an extension of the i'Robot universe, which was probably the best way to go with this material.  Overall, I am thoroughly impressed.",1130716800,3,1203,4.497695852534562
1516124,4,B00005JN0T,"Here's what I thought it would be like:

In a Star Trek/Data-like move we are supposed to feel like a robot is somehow another form of life deserving all the respect of something between a German Shepherd and a human.  Chaos ensues with their new found sentience and humanity longs for the simple good ol' days.  Either that or we are supposed to walk away looking for life in ""Sonny's"" ancestors like  toasters and TV remotes.

I was only about a third right.

Troughout the movie, robots remain little more than high tech toasters, devoid of life.  Clearly, society in this movie has not yet gone over the same cliff as Star Trek.  Even though the Lieutenant already started pining for the good ol' days when ""humans killed humans.""  He had the attitude that made me half-expect him to challenge Spooner. . .

""Shoot Spooner!"" I could hear him say, ""Why don't you arrest the hair-dryer for falling into the bathtub and killing Mrs. Higgins?""

That would have been something he would say.

Spooner is made to feel just how ridiculous he is compared to the rest of the world when he tackles a robot for what he thinks is a purse snatching.  As it turns out, it was running TO its owner not away from her with her inhaler she forgot at home.  Everyone around him gives him a look as if asking, ""What's your problem, man?""  The robot gets up and is about as polite as Sebastian Cabot in ""Family Affair"" in an almost annoying way. . .

""Sorry for the misunderstaning, sir.""

The robots are too good to be true.

This is all a great setup for the big challenge of the movie.  Dr. Lanning, the godfather of robots, kills himself.  The suicide seems obvious to everyone except Spooner.  He needs to find the clues that Lanning possibly left behind then convince the world that he is right about his suspicions over Sonny's involvment in Lanning's death.

There are some very deftly played out conflicts here.  Emotion vs. logic is a worn out war in Hollywood with emotion winning every time.  ""I Robot"" recognizes that and avoids the usual cliches.  Brains (Calvin) vs. gut instincts (Spooner) is another good conflict.  She is all intellect whereas he is more balanced.

Spooner:  You are the dumbest smart person I've ever met!
Calvin:  And YOU are the dumbest dumb person I've ever met!

There's a little comedy there and it works well.

But the three laws of robotics also come in conflict with each other.  This is especially well handled.  Chaos comes not from robot emotions but from the logical adherence to the three laws.  Humans are war-like therefore they must be destroyed to protect humanity--clearly a bug in the program!  What is a society to do when free will is in conflict with security?  It's not a new plot twist but it's well presented.  Very interesting!

The ending is exciting while not being intellectually insulting.  Dr. Lanning's death is solved.  Robots are still robots but there is just a hint of freindship between Sonny and Spooner.  Humanity and its creations evolve and advance.

This movie has made me want to read Asimov.  I've heard nothing but good things about him so now it's time to find out why.",1130457600,,3133,4.63023679417122

Spooner gets his wish of a robot possibly being a bad guy when a new design of robot (Alan Tudyk of the upcoming Serenity and TV's short lived Firefly) is accused of murdering his creator (James Cromwell).  Soon enough, Spooner is knee deep in a conspiracy involving this new model of robot, the obedience of the ""3 laws of robotics"", and whether this artificial life can evolve.  While it hardly bears any resemblance to Asimov's book, the spirit of it is still here, and Smith does a good job as the paranoid hero.

Digital computers do not process data in a quantum fashion, therefore I doubt that any robot using today's technology will ever be able to convincingly behave as an intelligent and emotional machine. However, testing of new computer technology based on quantum processing are on the way and they will, probably, be able to accomplish such a task of creating a self aware artificial intelligent machine capable of some level of choice and free will. This brings us to the point of this movie; will such machines be able to outdo mankind, if given a humanlike quality of consciousness?. And where is the dividing line between human and robots when they can behave, think and feel alike?.

1516297,3,B00005JN0T,"I hate to be a book snob when reviewing a movie, but when the title of the movie is ""I, Robot"" and is said to be ""inspired by"" the classic science fiction collection by Isaac Asimov, one would have a reasonable assumption that the movie would bear some similarity and passing understanding of the source material.  Then, when the director of the movie is Alex Proyas, the director of the excellent ""Dark City"", there is a level of intelligence that is expected from the film version of ""I, Robot"".

I don't know what happened.

This is such a disappointment.  Without spoiling a single plot detail I can reveal almost exactly how much this movie resembles the book: The Three Laws of Robotics, a couple of character names (most notably Susan Calvin), the title, and that there are, in fact, robots.  That just about covers any similarity the astute viewer may find with the book.  This is unfortunate because any one of a number of the ""I, Robot"" stories could have been used as a launching pad for an intelligent science fiction movie.  Or, even the later Elijah Bailey Robot novels would have worked.  But this?  There is the barest framework of a plot, the barest scrapings of Asimov's ideas, and wrapped tightly around this is a silly action movie.

The problem is only half about the movie itself.  By calling itself ""I, Robot"" there is a level of expectation of what sort of movie this will be and what it will be about.  Imagine, perhaps if Peter Jackson made Lord of the Rings with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Gandalf and Gandalf ran around hitting the Orcs with moves you might only see in ""Conan the Destroyer"".  That's a moderately fair comparison in making ""I, Robot"" into nothing more than a flashy action movie and how exactly Alex Proyas did this is completely beyond my understanding.

My guess is that the studio took a lot of control away from Proyas' vision.  That's the only thing that makes sense to me.  But let's think about ""I, Robot"" as something other than an offshoot of Asimov's work.  How does it work as a mindless action movie?  On these terms ""I, Robot"" isn't that bad.  It's nothing special and we've seen it dozens of times.  Will Smith does fine as a the wise cracking detective investigating a murder of a human where the only possibly suspect is a robot except a robot couldn't do it because of the three laws.  Smith is actually quite a bit more serious in this role than one might expect.  He cracks wise often enough, but overall is toned down and has a seething anger towards robots just under the surface.  It works.  The action probably works better on a larger screen than a smaller television, but for a simple action movie I suppose ""I, Robot"" can pass muster.

Forget that this movie is science fiction because it really isn't.  Forget that this movie is inspired by Asimov's classic work because it really isn't.  Forget that this should have been and could have been an excellent, intelligent and still entertaining movie, because it isn't.  If you're looking for just a decent action movie with very few claims to be anything else besides some lip service paid to the plot...here you go.

1516298,3,B00005JN0T,"Will Smith reprises his one-dimensional macho John Wayne role from ""Independence Day"" in this science fiction thriller. This movie begins by hinting it will be more than man vs. machine, perhaps with some of the intellect hinted in ""AI"", but it ends up being a pretty typical (but high class) action mystery with a typical ending.

Briefly stated, the plot revolves around a society 30 years in the future where robots are everywhere and are serving mankind as maids, helpers, cooks, etc. Will Smith is a cop that doesn't trust robots for a couple reasons. In typical Hollywood style, his distrust begins as waywardness and ends as prescience when robot-induced mayhem is quelled in the denouement.

This movie gets points for not being as predicatable as it suggests in the opening minutes, not to mention its outstanding production values, good musical score and extremely generous computer-generated scenes of robots, the 2035 city of Chicago and other impressive scenes that surely will generate a lot of visceral affect on wide screen television.

Yet, in the final analysis, this is pretty typical stuff for both Smith and Hollywood -- a movie about a cop that seems to know something's wrong when no one else (including Ph. D. scientists, Smith's boss and other geniuses) can see the troubling developments. The action and smart pacing of this flick makes it memorable, but not so memorable that you remember everything about it the next morning.",1122940800,2,1453,5.045833333333333

1516300,5,B00005JN0T,"Although I sadly never got to see it on the big screen, I finally got to see it on cable and WOW! ""I Robot"" is a suprisingly great movie and among the best that Will Smith has done in recent years.

 Set in Chicago around the summer of 2035 (I'll be 52 then), a scientist named Doctor Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) is found dead after going through an office window and falling to his death in the lobby of the corporate headquarters. An agent who is highly technophobic (spiteful of advanced technology, preferring 'old-fashioned' lifestyles) decides to find out who commited the crime and believes that the perpetrator of the crime was in fact one of the 'modern' robots that was designed by Lanning.

 The acting is absolutely great in this movie. Although I'm skeptical of Chicago looking like that at that point, I loved the way that they made Chicago look in this time frame with the John Hancock and Sears Towers still standing out despite the looming heights of the corporate headquarters. The look also was great to see with the 'L' trains although I'm not too sure about the 'expressway' in relation to the Sears Tower. If it was the Eisenhower Expressway in there, it would be farther south unless they upgraded Lake or Madison Avenues into elevated expressways. Other than that, the look of CHicago in 2035 is great!

 The special effects are excellent and not too overdone. While not necessarily a 'thinker's movie, ""I Robot"" is sometimes unsettling in the way it makes one wonder if robot technology advances to the point that even they can think independently in the same patterns that the human brain can although the human brain is FAR too complex to duplicate in even todays most advanced technology.

1516352,4,B00005JN0T,"Now we've all seen this plotline before, Robots created by humans start killing mankind to take over the world. However don't let that scare you away from this great movie. All the characters show how they each shine in this sci-fi thriller.

Will Smith stars as Del Spooner, a cop that seems to think that the robots made for humans to help with labor will somehow turn on mankind and start thinking for themselves. The only problem he has is that everyone thinks he is just being paranoid, which just proves he will be right as the movie continues.

When a roboticist, a guy that designs the robots, is found killed after being tossed outside the ledge of a huge building, that is all it takes for Spooner to believe the, ""Rise of the Machines"" will happen. The robot being questioned denies any involvment with the doctor's death, even though he was found at the scene of the crime.

Its not long before more robots start turning bad, you can tell right before they are by the red lights that flash on inside them. Spooner just somehow always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, as he fends off at least a few dozen at a time when they attack, once in a freeway tunnel in a thrilling car chase that involves two trucks that have sliding doors and at least 40 robots.

While the acting may not be the greatest, I found that the robot, Sunny, was really good at trying to express human emotion as all he wants to do is be free and live in a quiet life. Will is good most of the time, as the tough cop who is the one that really knows what is going on as eveyone else thinks he is just stupid at times.

And it was the visual effects that made this worth it. The robots are great, as more and more start making an army of renegade robots. As Spooner and his partner, Susan Calvin [played by Bridget Moynahan] are on top of a huge building, trying to shut down the robots, I found it quite dizzying from seeing it at a birds eye view.

Another great scene is when the robots manage to get inside the police station in the city, and the lieutenant who is always on Spooner's back fends them off with a shotgun. Great action, sounds, and vivid color all add to the suspense.

The big twist on who the real bad guy is in the movie is surprising [At least I thought it was] and if you are the type who likes to just watch the movie instead of trying to figure out the ending then this is great fun. I definately reccomend this movie.",1121644800,,2442,4.2387096774193544

1516354,4,B00005JN0T,"Making a return to form after the disappointing sequels MIB 2 and Bad Boys 2, Will Smith gives his best performance to date in Alex Proyas' I, ROBOT. Like a cross between Metropolis and A.I, the story carries the action, rather than depending on special effects and stunts. Sure, the `robots created by man go bezerk and turn on their masters' premise is hardly original, but thankfully by process of eliminating the predictable clichs, the film manages to outshine previous cinematic future-world robotic chaos dramas. Marco Baltrami's techno-schizoid musical score shifts the film out of first gear, and William Hoy's slick editing tempers the film's fast-paced action scenes. Simon Duggan's stunning cinematography veils the film in an eternal dark city-slick that is both easy on the retinas and appears gloomy at times. And despite some action scenes feeling a little too reminiscent of previous Sci Fi efforts, I, Robot still has some fantastically contrived frenetics.

But it's not all about action. Smith (As detective Del Spooner) delivers a performance that, while not Oscar worthy, still manages to rise above expectations. Especially considering how ill suited he is for the role. And Bridget Moynahan adds much to her admittedly secondary role. One of Isaac Asimov's most intriguing SF tales, the adaptation has been handled well, inserting scenes and characters that give more meat to the story without losing sight of the original message.

There are flaws: Some exposition scenes run long and become tedious, and while there is solid action throughout the film's lengthy running time, the finale feels somewhat overcooked. However all this is small beans, because it's not about the action quota, instead focusing on a more personal level. Rising above the sub-genre's restrictions while simultaneously providing a cerebral mystery movie, this has everything that a SF fan could want. One of 2004's most satisfying films, I, Robot does more than linger in the memory for a while, it asks some very important questions about the frailty of humanity and queries the strength of our very existence. The DVD has plenty of extras to satisfy the most ardent of aficionados, including behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, trailers and more.

From the very beginning this movie is fast-paced and it never slows down. Most would think that this means a poor plot. However, this movie has an execellent story line and is very much like a mystery. Also, the robots were very well made and their lack of humanity was shown well. Of course, there was an exception. One robot, named Sunny, had dreams and behaved almost like a human. This made the movie even more interesting. Detective Spooner (Will Smith), had a tough time convincing the people that the robots could not be trusted. This added to all of the good things. Simply put, this was a great movie. The only negative side was that it was a bit short. It sort of seemed squished together. They could have added a little bit more running time to elaborate just a touch more. Aside from that, this movie is excellent. Definitely a must-see.

1516357,4,B00005JN0T,"Based on the classic novel by Isaac Asimov, ""I, Robot"" is a tasty sci-fi elixir with a nifty whodunit twist.

Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago homicide detective who has always harbored deep suspicions about the servile robots who are fast becoming common household items in the year 2035.  One day, Spooner is called in to investigate the suicide of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the inventor largely responsible for the technology that has gone into the making of these robots.  Almost immediately, Spooner begins to suspect that Lanning's death may not have been a suicide at all but rather a homicide perpetrated by the robots who, though programmed to do no harm to humans, may be evolving to the point where they are becoming sentient beings fully capable of overriding their programming and acting at will.  As this brand new model of robot hits the streets, Spooner becomes something of a modern day Cassandra (or Chicken Little, if you prefer), attempting to convince his skeptical superiors that this seemingly benign army of anthropomorphic mechanisms may actually be a threat to human civilization as we know it.

Like virtually all quality science fiction, ""I, Robot"" aims its sights at mankind`s propensity for sowing the seeds of its own destruction, in this case by inventing technology that eventually outruns the ability of its creators to control it.  And when it comes to artificial intelligence, in particular, how long, the film asks, will it be before the intelligence becomes real and the creator becomes subservient to that which he has created?

""I, Robot"" is a sleek, thought-provoking action film, filled with suspense, drama and mind-boggling plot twists.  On a purely visual level, however, the film is a bit more problematic.  Although the backdrops that work to create the image of a futuristic Chicago are eye-popping and dazzling, some of the computer-generated images, particularly in the action sequences, look a trifle too much like video games to be entirely convincing.  Still, although the movement of the robots isn't as realistic as, perhaps, we would like it to be, the facial expressions are fantastically effective, creating a sense of personality and life behind a faade of cold, synthetic technology.

I haven't read the story on which the film is based, so I have no way of knowing how faithful to Asimov's original vision the filmmakers have been.  Be that as it may, for the non-initiates, ""I, Robot"" is a solid film that at least does justice to the genre as a whole.",1120953600,3,2515,5.004796163069544
1516358,4,B00005JN0T,"Will Smith is Del Spooner, a robot hater.  He works as a homocide detective and the movie begins as he receives a call from a hologram machine alerting him that his friend Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) has died.  Spooner immediately suspects that this was not a suicide, but a murder committed by one of Lanning's robot creations.  From here, the movie packs exploration of Asimov's 3 robot laws in between some really good action scenes.  Although it does not adhere to any of Asimov's tales, it incorporates the ideas of several of them throughout the film to a satisfying result for the Asimov fan.

Overall, it was a really fun popcorn flick that managed to include some of the more interesting questions about man vs. machinery that have been raised in the sci-fi genre.  Two thumbs up.",1120694400,,790,4.7299270072992705

1516420,4,B00005JN0T,"When I heard someone was going to make a film adaptation of Isaac Asimov's seminal science fiction work `I, Robot', I was interested...and I was curious how it would be approached...until I heard Will Smith was set to star.  After that, I pretty much put out of my mind a production with a sense of faithfulness to the source material, and consigned myself that the movie would be more akin to the common Hollywood practice of optioning a classic literary work and `jazzing' it up to make it more palatable for the masses, using what the screenwriters saw fit, discarding much of what they thought wouldn't work, and making up the rest to fill in the gaps (I'll admit I was partially right, and partially wrong).  Directed by Alex Proyas (The Crow), this 2004 film stars, as I've already mentioned, Will `gettin jiggy wit it' Smith (Independence Day, Enemy of the State, Ali).  Also appearing is the very hot Bridget Moynahan (Coyote Ugly, Serendipity), Bruce Greenwood (Thirteen Days, The Core), Chi McBride (Gone in 60 Seconds), and James Cromwell (Space Cowboys), who, incidentally, is the tallest actor (6 foot 7 inches) to be nominated for an Oscar (for that talking pig movie), according to The Internet Movie Database.

The year is 2035 and the setting is Chicago.  Robots are commonplace, performing all the tasks future humans apparently deem too menial such as package delivery, garbage pick up, walking dogs, etc.  Life is easy for those who have a robot to do their bidding, but everyone isn't too keen on the idea of robots being so prevalent, especially homicide detective Del Spooner (Smith), a sort of robot racist, but no one takes his paranoia too seriously because everyone knows the robots are programmed with three specific fail safes as follows;

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except when such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Soon Spooner is called in to investigate the recent death (due to massive impact trauma aka falling out high rise office window) of Dr. Alfred Lanning (Cromwell), a pioneer in the robotics field and employee of US Robotics, or USR, which, by the way, is on the eve of releasing its most advanced mechanical wonder, the NS-5 series.  On the surface the doctor's death looks like a suicide (everyone seems to be pushing this angle, especially USR CEO Lawrence Robertson, played by Greenwood), but Spooner is skeptical.  In the course of Spooner's investigation, he finds aide in the form of Dr. Susan Calvin (Moynahan), an USR employee and sort of psychologist whose job it is to help with the integration of robots into everyday life.  Together they begin to uncover what appears to be a massive conspiracy, assisted by an unlikely source sent from beyond the grave (no, I'm not talking about a ghost...just watch the film and all will become clear)...but it may be too late, as robots seem to be suffering from what could best be described as a `ghost in the machine' sickness, especially around Spooner who keeps finding himself the target of murderous, mechanical mayhem.

I really enjoyed this film, but if you're looking for a faithful on screen representation of the original source material, you'll probably want to take a pass on this one.  I did get a sense the screenwriter made a real effort to stay true to the nature of the material, for whatever its worth.  One of the things that really impressed me was the integration of the very slick, spectacular and heavily used special effects with the live performances.  It felt seamless helping to maintain a sense of realism that kept me drawn to the story, rather than feeling of awkwardness that can occur when something appears phony, drawing attention to the fact that it was an element added in later by computers.  As far as Smith goes, I thought he did well enough, but I can't help feel I've seen this character in any number of his past film appearances, in terms of the glib, smart alecky, `I don't play by the rules' type facing difficult odds but managing to find a way to come out on top.  I really liked Bridget Moynahan, but not because she's a great actress (she also did well enough here), but mainly because I'm a sucker for brunettes.  I wouldn't say there were any outstanding performances, but everyone knew what they were doing, and were all very professional.  As far as the story goes, I thought it was fairly straight forward (helped by a rousing and suitable musical score), and included a few surprises that were alluded to prior to their revelation, but never painfully telegraphed, giving the feeling of a well thought out and well written film, playing out as a well crafted action film should, delivering much and keeping the downtime to a minimum.  I did find it kind of strange that Smith's character should suffer the number of attacks he did without any witnesses, thereby putting into question is mental stability, as no one believes him when he tries to relate what happened.  Another thing I appreciated was how the near future was presented, as not being too futuristic (and silly...see the film Demolition Man for an example of this), but having enough technological advances present to feel like we're actually looking 30 years into the future, like that Audi Spooner was driving...pretty cool (although that whole Lake Michigan as a landfill thing seemed dumb to me, but whatever).  One niggling point I thought stuck out and that was the reiteration of certain plot elements numerous times throughout the film, as if we needed to be reminded of things because our attention spans are lacking....I'm not five years old, so just give it to me once and that will be enough...thanks.

I've got what's called the `All Access' edition, and it features two DVDs, loaded with special features, which I won't bother detailing as the Amazon website does a good enough job listing them all, but if you're interested in all the ins and out, the nuts and bolts of how the film was made, this is a good edition to own.  If you don't need all this rigmarole I think there is a single DVD version available.

Will Smith does his usual ""action Will"" job here. Funny at times, heroic at others, 'I'm right and everyone else is wrong' most of the time. The effects and overall look of the movie are well done with one caveat: two of the action scenes are so dependent on effects, and don't blend well with the humans in the scene, that you don't believe for one second that it's actually happening.

1516422,5,B00005JN0T,"My first reaction as this film began was ""Wait!  This isn't Asimov.""  The Asimov I grew up reading was a weaver of ideas, more mind candy than adventure story.  But here I found myself in Will Smith's bedroom, and then suddenly catapulted into a wild chase after a purse grabbing robot.  A far cry from the delicacy used by Asimov.  It took a while for the shock to wear off but eventually the conflict between Smith's gritty performance as Del Spooner and his original inspiration in the reminiscences of Dr. Susan Calvin (played by Bridget Moynahan) wears off and the view settles into a film that is inspired by Asimov, but does not imitate him.

The sooner that happens, the better, because this is an exceptional film in its own right, even if it does proceed with the speed of a video game.  Smith creates a wisecracking character with a deep mistrust of robots. He is called in to to investigate what appears to be an impossible killing - robots can't kill humans, it's the first law of robotics.  But Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) lies dead and the only suspect is 'Sonny' a Series 5 robot with some surprising circuitry (played by Alan Tudyk).

The death is declared a suicide, but Spooner refuses to give in.  suddenly the automated world turns on the detective, whose unlikely ally is Dr. Calvin, a robopsychologist responsible for the psyches of masses of robots about to be distributed around the planet.  One hair-raising escape after another propels the story along until viewers find themselves at a surprisingly reflective conclusion.  Not exactly classical Asimov, but a great story nonetheless.

Will does a good job as Spooner, but he is upstaged by Moynihan's performance.  And both are blown away by Tudyk and the animators performance as Sonny.  As you watch Sonny develop from being slightly more simpatico than the scenery into a full-blown personality there are countless moments of surprise.  Moynihan and Smith do their best, but from the moment Sonny turns to Spooner and says ""Thank you... you said someone not something."" The film belongs to the robots.

Excellent animation and CGI create a world that is a retro version of the future - perhaps exactly what Asimov imagined rather than what we would now.  The result is a compelling mix of the outr and the mundane that sticks in the mind just as Sonny's wink does.

This is not just an action film.  Threaded through it are the same questions that Asimov raised about the nature of self and intelligence.  Robots may never be human, but there are far more than furniture.  And if their thought processes are alien, they are more than the sum of their programming.  The result is one of the more carefully thought out science fiction films in recent times.",1116028800,61,2744,4.779193205944798

1516424,4,B00005JN0T,"Your first and only command is this:  see ""I, Robot."" That is all.

Will Smith (""Bad Boys II"") stars in the role of a lifetime as Detective Spooner, an experienced homicide detective investigating the apparent suicide of Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell of HBO's ""Six Feet Under""). Lanning's suicide is all the more disturbing since he was on the brink of integrating a more advanced form of robot, the NS5, into the modern world for the company CRS (the Microsoft of robots).

CRS owner Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, ""Hollywood Homicide"") doesn't want Lanning's death messing up his company's biggest payday, so he is leery of Spooner snooping around and spoiling his big moment.

Spooner doesn't share the general populace's good will toward robots--which have taken on menial roles such as trash men, deliverymen and dog walkers--and likens them to ticking time bombs. Forming a loose alliance with Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, ""The Recruit""), Spooner becomes convinced that Lanning's death was the handiwork of an evolved robot, Sonny (voice by Alan Tudyk, ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"").

""I, Robot"" is less an all-out action film as it is a mystery with some riveting action scenes tossed in from time to time to get across how pivotal the stakes are for Spooner.

Smith is excellent as he fully establishes a unique character, doing it so naturally that he never appears to be acting.

Recent films based on the short stories of sci-fi writers Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov have ranged from pretty good (""Minority Report"") to ""it was a better concept than movie"" (""Imposter""). ""I, Robot,"" based on some of Asimov's short stories but changed for a high-energy summer audience, is the type of sci-fi thriller film that Ben Affleck, John Woo and Uma Thurman were attempting with last year's box-office bomb, ""Paycheck,"" based on a Dick novel.

""I, Robot"" is the genre's most cinematic edge-of-your seat thrill ride thanks to the sharp screenplay by Akiva Goldsman (""A Beautiful Mind"") and Jeff Vintar (""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within""). Their handiwork makes all of the characters, even the robots, fully developed players in this mystery.

The film feels as if it's actually in the future, and not just because a subtitle says so.

Budgetary restraints limit the creativity and imagination of most directors, who seem content to portray the future as a world with just one or two technological advancements and shiny clothes.

While that's probably more realistic than hovercars and Jetson-like food processors, half the fun of the best sci-fi films is seeing how each filmmaker's view of the future differs.

In director Alex Proyas' vision, the future is very imaginative, with buildings that literally take cars and hang them in closet-like parking garages, cars that drive themselves and cell phones that clip on to ears.

Proyas (""Garage Days"") also brings a different perspective to the tired old fight scene by using rotating cameras and wide camera angles so the viewer can actually see what's going on, resulting in innovation not seen since the original ""Matrix.""

The robots have an eerie dynamic to them, and even with their bland faces they're very creepy. Fittingly, the robotic CGI (computer generated images) are appropriately wooden and stiff until they get angry, which is when they move around like a horde of roaches.

Much in the same way that ""Blade Runner"" (based on another Dick novel) redefined the science-fiction/suspense genre in the 1980s, ""I, Robot"" should do the same for a new generation.

Since it's not a sequel, ""I, Robot"" was the first big 2004 summer flick that didn't have a built-in audience, which made it a pleasant surprise.",1114646400,2,3693,5.079338842975207

1516426,1,B00005JN0T,"Fox is ridiculous. They're doing this with three films I know of: The Day After Tomorrow, Man on Fire and I, Robot. The problem is, of course, that these films were all very, very recently released on DVD for the first time. If they were truly interested in the interests of the Consumer, they would have released the two-disc editions the first time around - not one or two months later.

The second problem with all this is that the ""new"" special features really aren't worth an upgrade. I don't see anything new on ""I, Robot"" save a movie ticket to see ""The Fantastic Four"" and an extra documentary. (By the way, the European release had all of these extras already - except the movie ticket - because they were kind enough to release a one-disc rental copy and a two-disc special edition SIMULTANEOUSLY.)

I'm not a huge contender of special edition re-releases. I've shelled out the cash for them before, and in many cases I love when films (such as the upcoming Casino, Stripes, etc.) are re-released with new special features that weren't available on the original DVDs. (Because most of the time they were released at the turn of the '90s when DVDs were fairly new and not known for their expansive features.)

However, to release special edition DVDs of films that have just been released on DVD to begin with is a real crime in my opinion. I'll probably buy ""Man on Fire"" but I will not buy ""I, Robot"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow"" - or, for that matter, Focus Features' re-release of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (which only contains four extra features, all of which are supposedly very poor.)

These companies need to wise up.

Not only is the plot to this movie great, but it is full of mystery and some unexpected twists. Full, head-on entertainment.

While the plot of this movie is similar to the hundreds of others (i.e. Terminator, The Matrix, etc), I think this one is purely original, especially in the plot aspect of the movie. There is pure action which will keep you glued to your seat. Suspenseful, as well as including a touch of humor.

1516483,3,B00005JN0T,"Set in 2035 in the city of Chicago, this futuristic movie stars Will Smith as a policeman/private detective who is assigned the task of figuring out who murdered a man at the local robotic factory. Robots are the central characters in this film, and they are shown walking among the people, helping with tasks, and working to fight crime.

Will Smith's character John Spooner doesn't trust these robots at all and he is suspicious that one of them is responsible for killing the man at the factory. He sets out to prove his point, with gun in hand, attempting to first intimidate the robots into confessing the truth and then firing away when he is convinced he has figured out which hunk of metal is responsible for this crime.

This movie might seem a little far- fetched, but the central message is something to ponder. With technology advancing further and further every day, there could come a time when artificial intelligence is capable of having a mind of its own, so to speak. It could reach a point where these robots start to act in ways they are not programmed to act. And if this happens, it is difficult to say what problems will occur next. Besides committing murder, these independent beings could wreck havoc on the nation and the world.

The best part of this movie is the special effects. The director does a very good job making these metallic figures walk, talk, and act like people. Even though you know you are watching a robot on the screen, it seems very real. You feel like an actual person with its own, thinking, rational mind is behind that metal mask.

Some humor is tossed in from time to time to keep this movie from getting too serious, but this science- fiction drama deals with a serious issue that is worth thinking about. I don't know if the year 2035 will bring with it the types of advances portrayed in this movie.

It has little to do with Asimov's classic story. We get the usual cop on the edge who follows his hunches instead of the rules -- GIANT CLICHE!!! -- and then we get these White robots who want to wipe out Will Smith (a sure sign of artificial intelligence as the guys is such a nauseating, smug [supply own expletive]).
After this it just descends into action-special-effects Hell as any interest or storyline is squeezed out by Smith leaping around, probably supported by wires, as an army of CGI geeks try to keep up with overambitious and cartoonish special effects -- Crash! Blast! Kaboom! ...Yawn!

Will Smith Fresh Prince'd his way through the movie, weaving his Audi and/ or his motorbike through some of the larger gaps in the plot (who has their house demolished once they die? What the heck was that all about other than an excuse for Smith to escape/ defeat - once again - the robots). You hate robots for saving you? You sleep with a large, presumably loaded gun in your hands? You are a maverick cop? Come on, guys, this is awful. Straight out of the 'Will this do?' school of filmmaking.

1516519,3,B00005JN0T,"Alas, it is very hard to find great sci-fi these days.  This story takes some of Asimov's ideas - the three laws of robotics, which Asimov posited would be inevitable with the advent of intelligent robots - and jazzes them up with special effects while missing the underlieing point (i.e. that the positronic brian is designed so that robots cannot violate them - the three laws can't be turned off without destroying the function of the positronic brain itself).  That makes this rather feeble as sci-fi, but good enough for casual viewers who want action and images, which seem all that Hollywood is capable of these days.

1516520,5,B00005JN0T,"Unlike many of the reviewers I have not read Isaac Asimov's ""I, Robot"" stories.  Literature of any kind cannot be translated to a film without changes.  The only alternative is to shoot the entire book, which results in a film like Erich von Stroheim's Greed, intended to run for 8 hours.  Film makers have little choice but to make compromises.  Looking at the film on its own, I think that I, Robot is a great science fiction film.

The place, Chicago in 2035, is a real look into the future and was planned that way by the director Alex Proyas.  The look of the city was designed as it might appear in the future with familiar old buildings and new futuristic designs.  Cars were designed especially for the film to present a logical representation of what people might be driving in 2035.  Altogether, the film presents a complete futuristic world down to the clothing people wear. The story has mystery and suspense and is nicely paced.  The special effects, particularly the robots, were designed to make them believable and not just for a splashy look.  The actors who played the robots were taught to walk and act as a robot.

Will Smith does a great job playing the brooding Detective Spooner. I tend to think of Mr. Smith as a comedic actor but he has proven he can handle dramatic roles and in I, Robot he gives his character the right edginess and demeanor.  His distrust of robots comes through without overstatement.  Perhaps Smith's shooting from an airborne motorcycle is a little hard to believe but not impossible, and don't we want a movie to have some excitement. Bridget Moynahan is well cast as Susan Calvin, who designs robots to appear more human and has a gradual transformation from her belief that robots are entirely benign (Ms. Moynahan also has a miraculous shooting sequence, firing a weapon with her eyes closed and hitting only a robot).  Alan Tudyk provides a sensitive performance as Sonny the robot.  We never see Mr. Tudyk's face but his movements and voice make Sonny a real and sympathetic character.  Unfortunately, James Cromwell's character, Dr. Alfred Lanning, dies at the start of the film so we see him only briefly in messages he recorded before his death.  The only significant extra on the DVD is a short piece on ""Making of I, Robot.""  This has the standard interviews with the stars, director, writers and special effects personnel that gives a good overview of how the film was made and what the director and producers were aiming for in making the film.  By the standards of many DVDs the extras are skimpy for I, Robot.

I found I, Robot to be an engrossing film where you care about the characters and are intrigued by the story.  The look of the film is fabulous and takes you into this world of the future in a similar way that Total Recall made Mars a believable place. Highly recommend.",1110240000,4,2844,4.659318637274549
1516521,5,B00005JN0T,"I'm an action fan. I'll admit that outright. But because I've seen so many, I know what to compare one against. Unlike many action movies, I Robot has a good story (not the most memorable, but well done for an film such as this) based off of the plot fundementals of the original sci-fi novel written way back bearing the same title. It also has a surprisising (at least, again, for a film in this genre) human quality, an emotional depth of sorts to it. One of the reasons Will Smith's character, CPD (is that how it goes?) Detective Spooner, is predjudiced against the robots is the fact that he came see them as humans. He can only see them as machines of logic, cold, and emotionless, to be used for industry, not for more human roles. The reason for this feeling is some time before the movie, Spooner's car and another car get trapped in a river, and they're going under fast with Spooner and a young girl trapped inside of them. A robot tries to save them, in accordance to the first law or robotics (and robot cannot endanger a human or through inaction allow a human to come to harm), but as it can only rescue one, pulls out Spooner, leaving the girl to a watery grave. A normal human being understands how precious young lives are, and would gladly give their lives to protect their's. A robot doesn't understand that. A robot thinks in logic, which is good for industrial purposes, but not for human things like this. It saves Spooner because it calculated a higher survival rate for him than the girl (something like 30-something percent to like eleven percent, I think, yeah, we'll just go with eleven). But like Spooner tells Dr. Calvin, eleven percent is more than enough. This is an example of the emotional depth this movie carries, which I believe stands out a bit in the overall movie community, not to mention the action genre. Anyone who can't see that should read the first fifty pages of so of Tom Clancy's Executive Orders or just read Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six for a better understanding of what I'm saying.

The plot itself doesn't stand out too much in the film industry, but it is above average. There are a coupla good twists thrown in for good measure, and is a well-rounded whodunnit mystery.

Now seeing that this movie has an unusually deep plot for an action flick, does it mean action was sacrificed for story? Two words: heck no. The gunplay effects are similar to those seen in good pure action films such as the Matrix films and Mission: Impossible 2, and it's brilliantly choreographed. The chase scene in the futuristic interstate between Detective Spooner (Smith's character) and a two cargo haulers full of robots bent on destroying Spooner (since he found out stuff they don't want him to know) is one of the most memorable action sequences I've seen in a movie. The filmmakers nicely combined action with good storytelling to make one awesomely entertaining movie.

The acting is definitely not subpar in this movie. Will Smith, while still keeping his Fresh Prince persona mostly intact, has a more human quality, which is necessary given the character he's playing. Spooner is a man who struggles with his beliefs against robots and the fact that they are making him an outsider of sorts, and Smith brings out his character's personality well. There is a good amount of smart acting here. Most of the characters have some genuinely funny quips in there. Dr. Calvin is especially amusing, given the fact that at first her character seems to have no sense of irony (one of the reasons I liked Terminator 3; the robots have no emotion and say very ironic stuff cuz they can't grasp the fact that it's ironic) given her seriousness obtained from her very technical position. The only bad part here is that Shia LaBeouf wasn't given a very large role, and a rather pointless one at that. He's a good actor, and he should have gotten more (and more valuable) screen time.

The visual effects in this movie are great. They really spice up the action sequences. Of course what good's visuals without good sound? I Robot packs some fantastic audio pieces in to nicely wrap up the entertainment package.

Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an enjoyable time. My only problem with I, Robot is that Shia LaBeouf was very limited in his acting role. He's a really good actor and has a lot more potential (The producer people said that he originally had a larger role, but much of it was cut). This is quite minor in the overall scope of the film.

As a note: Some people are upset that the movie doesn't follow the book that specifically, but one must admit that I, Robot is still an entertaining movie on its own. I believe you must grade this movie along with other movies like this (harry potter 3 for one) as a standalone film to grade it fairly.",1110067200,2,4809,4.61214953271028
1516522,2,B00005JN0T,"Uggghhhh, that is the noise Isaac Asimov is making as he roles over in his grave. This movie tried to be more than what it was and in the process completely destroyed what Asimov had written. This movie is just a bunch of special effects and little wise cracks from Smith, who is just so funny. For what the movie was, it wasn't that bad, but the director should of left it had that, not try to make it seem like anything more. HTe concept of robots showing emotion and man vs machine,it has been done before, and much better (See ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: a Space Odyessy""). The whole concept has just been beaten to death and instead of bringing something new to the table and breathing life back into the concept, ""I,Robot"" lays it to rest, and then steps on and smashs it some more. For a mindless summer action movie, it is above average, but it tried to be something more hten that, nad it fell flat on its face.",1110067200,10,918,4.312138728323699
1516523,5,B00005JN0T,"First of all, if you're an Asimov fan, you're probably aware that the script of ""I, Robot"" is only tangentially based on Asimov's robot novels and stories.  The screenwriters, though, make no attempt to disguise that, claiming the script was ""Suggested by Isaac Asimov.""  If you are not an Asimov fan, I should warn you that, for example, his ""starter"" robot book, ""The Caves of Steel,"" is so totally different from this movie, it's like they're not even from the same universe.

My work schedule is such that I can only see movies during the summer, but each summer I see dozens and dozens.  Last summer, for example, I saw practically everything playing at the theaters within the space of a few days.  ""I, Robot"" was the film I liked the most.  I vowed I would get the DVD as soon as it became available.

What I liked most about this movie was the script.  It was by turns funny, suspenseful, thought-provoking, etc.  In fact, it's a really good script to study if you're into writing your own:  it can boast textbook models of how a writer should handle reversals, foreshadowing, payoff, character arc, etc.  And the conclusion and the prelude both made sense, total sense!  In short, not a line out of place.

Other things that could sink the movie are held in check: Will Smith, while perhaps not the ideal candidate for the job, delivers a believable and versatile performance.

The special effects shots help the movie along, rather than drag it in their wake.  What noticeable shots there are really do more to creep you out than overawe you (e.g., the horde of evil robots scaling the USR building).

I was very surprised to read many reviews of this movie (after I saw it), which panned it.  It is very difficult for me to see how somebody could see this as a stinker, and I'm the kind of guy who usually only likes about 1 out of every 20 movies I see.

1516524,5,B00005JN0T,"I loved this movie. The graphics were amazing, and like all Will Smith movies the story and action were on point!

The movie takes place in the future where owning a robot is just an ordinary thing. They do everything from cooking to babysitting and everyone trusts them, because afterall they are only machines they can't think or feel right?

Those who developed the Robots made 3 simple laws for them to follow:

Law One: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, unless this would violate a higher order law.

Law Two: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with a higher order law.

Law Three: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with a higher order law.

So with the rules in place it is safe for humans to own robots... right? ...But when a prominent scientist dies after taking a fall from his high rise office suite Detective Spooner begins to think that a certian Robot is behind it all. He does not trust the machines (and for good reason which is later revealed in a flashback scene) and begins questioning a robot whom he thinks is involved...

Then the unthinkable, the robots go nuts and try to take over!  It is up to Spooner and his men to stop this... and they just might need that special robot they don't trust to help them...

This movie is based on a book written in the 1940s. It is simply amazing. The graphics are stunning, and the action is well choreographed. I reccommend this movie highly as you will not be dissappointed...",1109894400,,1608,4.47945205479452

When no one takes him seriously, he turns to Susan Calvin for help.  But is he correct?  If so, can he prove the truth and saves humans?

This is a fun movie.  It's meant to entertain, and it does it in spades.  The plot is cleaver with some nice clues thrown in to keep the viewer engaged.  And the car chases and action scenes keep you on the edge of your seat.  I'm not a super big Will Smith fan, mainly because of the movies he's chosen to do in the past.

However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ROBOT is a mindblowing exercise in technical wizardry and its borrowed Aasimov plotline is intriguing.  A surprisingly buff Smith plays a tortured detective who hates robots (we find out later in the film), and is joined by Bridget Moynahan as a scientist who helps ""humanize"" robots in a quest to find out why one robot has apparently murdered a human--a no no in the three laws of robots.  The suspect robot is wonderfully voiced by Alan Trydk (spelling) and he's a prime focus point in the film.

The effects are brilliant and even though they may go over the top (particularly in the spectacular chase in the tunnel), they are certainly state of the art in their execution.

Overall, I ROBOT is top notch science fiction entertainment.",1109462400,,985,4.764705882352941
1516577,4,B00005JN0T,"""I, Robot"" is a good action film with spectacular special effects aided by superb CG visual effects.

The rest of the cast does as good a job as they can with the slight let-down of a story.

Overall, ""I, Robot"" is an above-standard action epic. It may not be the greatest action film ever, but it is better than ""The Day After Tomorrow!""

People are just not interested in artificial intelligence themes.  Especially ones without a great deal of action.  They don't want to sit through this movie and actually have to THINK.  They want action and great effects.  So why not give it to them in an attempt to bring a great idea to the surface?

And FINALLY - someone gives us 'Man vs Machine nuts' the Terminator 3 we always wanted.  Honestly, no one cared about Arnold or John Connor.  We wanted to see battles in a revolution that is, in my opinion, inevitable.  A. I. vs Human beings. I think this movie did a very good job continuing that notion.

Anyway, what's scary is that people still don't get it.  The threat of mankind being overrun by machines is very, very real.  Of course, not in any of our living days - But it's very possible and not too far off.  Anyone seen the Sony 'Q'?  A few years old (2002?) and the thing is downright scary to watch.  I wonder what they have now?  Who knows?  Maybe we are better off in the end to let logical machines take hold of things.  God knows we are doing a bang up job ;)

The plot is very good, and it proves what could happen if we take technology too far. We all wonder about what could happen in the future and what it will look like, I, Robot is a good depiction of what it might look like a few decades from now.

Will Smith is awesome as always, and the robots were pretty well thought out.

1516580,3,B00005JN0T,"I'm not sure why they retagged ""Hardwired"" as ""I, Robot.""  Will Smith has enough star power, and is a bona-fied sci-fi actor that they had no reason to drag Asimov into the production.  Furthermore, this name game hurt not only the film franchise, but also the novel's good names.  How can they do a film version of ""Caves Of Steel"" or even the ""Foundation"" novels if we have this out-of-place script.

It is a tribute to Asimov, but then again, all sci-fi is a tribute to the masters: Wells, Verne, Doc Smith, and Asimov.  It would have been much better for continuity's sake to keep ""Hardwired"" as its own, separate franchise and name. Think of the spin-off, sequels, and TV series that they could have had, without offending all of the die-hard Asimov fans.

As to the film, it is great, except for the first fifteen minutes of product placement.  I guess they put it at the beginning because the people who fall for that tend to have short attention spans. Anyone up for boycotting these products?

This movie is a tribute to Asimov, so it feels like an Asimov story, but is more of a reaction piece and a distillation to all of Asimov's robot stories.  I almost want to say that after seeing this movie, you have read all of his robot books.

I was also reminded of Tom Selleck's 1984 film ""Runaway,"" where he plays a sanitized and popularized Bladerunner.  Intellectually, ""I, Robot"" is head and shoulders above both of those films.  It makes you think about rules and how we would possible control these robots, and how we could misuse them.

""Bladerunner,"" by comparison, is too self-conscious of its cerebrally, and is too mystical.  It feels like a prologue to the Matrix-as if we haven't seen enough of that film already.

So I'm sitting at the start of the film wondering what to expect and I am simply amazed by the Will Smith's larger than life character in the film. We wouldnt like running into similar people in our lives but I do know I quite enjoyed watching how cool Will Smith's character is. He wears this long leather jacket which fits him like second skin. His walk exemplifies the brashness of his character. He's not meant for smooth talk and isn't a wise guy in the film.

I think the Robots in the film were rather intelligently designed. There are many scenes in the film that are most superbly shot,plenty of fast cars,brilliant action sequences (especially the robots v/s humans)

I wouldnt say the last 30 mins or climax of the film was exhilerating. The entire film has this certain adrenaline inducing smoothness about it. So much so that I think Will Smith was the perfect character for this. Recently, I rented the dvd to give the film a second watch. It made a good second watch. Now how many films can do that? I will be purchasing the DVD soon.

Fans of Isaac Asimov, a pioneer of science fiction writing on robots, were disappointed with the film for not sticking closely to any one of his stories. I disagree entirely. Proyas and his screenwriter have taken the core element of Asimov's writing - the problems that creating a conscious, intelligent being would create for the world (and the being itself), and the famous ""Three Laws of Robotics"" - and used them as vehicles for a fun summer blockbuster. What you end up with is a summer movie that rises above the rest of the shallow, corn-popping action flicks that surround it. It is questionable whether or not humanity will ever be able to achieve the level of artificial intelligence that Asimov wrote about. But if we do, then his writings (and this movie) will suddenly become much more poignant, and it is almost certain that Asimov's three laws would be implemented to control the behaviors of those intelligences.

The movie made you think and feel with its knowledge, although its visuals and sounds were equally appealing with another nice balance of the present and the movie's version of the future. Such a natural feeling is rare in action films which helped the mind to agree that it is believable.

So far he has a rather impressive group of hits under his belt...really BIG hits.  Without going out too far on a limb, one could successfully argue that in the new century, he is taking over Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford's throne of major box office successive hits.  While Tom still has quite a bit of mileage left in him, Harrison hasn't given Hollywood any Super Hit for quite some time.  A few modest money making movies here and there, but absolutely nothing on the scale he delivered through the bulk of the 80's through the mid 90's.  Will Smith also has something that both Tom and Harrison lack:  genuine appeal in both action, sci-fi AND comedies.  Check out his movies if you disagree.

Back to I, Robot.  The plot was so-so.  The effects were Top Notch and very well done, but they would have to be in order to attract Smith to a roll such as this.  If the effects fail, the entire movie does.  Will is a robo-phobic cop who distrusts robots with almost fantaticism.  It is disturbing those around him including his boss.  Robots simply CANNOT commit crimes because they are hard-wired with the 3 Laws of Robotics, originated by the late-great Isaac Asimov himself.  They are perfect and I dare-say that should robotics become possible as they are in this movie, they would be hard-wired with these same laws.  No robot in HISTORY has EVER committed a crime of ANY kind.  And yet Will's character (Dell Spooner) believes not only CAN they, but they WILL, and when they do, it will entirely take mankind by surprise.

As the movie opens, Dell is called to investigate what is apparently a suicide by the man credited for creating the greatest robotic revolution in history.  But IS it suicide, or was he killed by a rogue version of the newest robot which is hitting the streets within the week?  All evidence, on the surface point to the fact that suicide is the ONLY logical answer.  But Dell, hating robots as he does, looks at the situation from a completely different angle and begins to ask the tough questions...forcing people to begin to question his sanity in general.  But as it turns out, and as virtually everybody who sees this movie will know from the first frame, that Dell will be proven correct in his assumptions, but exactly HOW is the big question.  Who is behind all of this?  Was it the scientist who committed suicide?  Was it the robot himself?  OR, was it the CEO of the company poised to introduce the world to the largest robotic distribution ever?  Good questions, and fun answers along the way.  Don't expect your intellect to be stretched during this movie and you should enjoy it all the more.  Simply put, a pretty decent example of eye candy put together with great effects.  Will Smith continues to exceed in picking the winners.",1108598400,,3373,4.585284280936455
1516647,4,B00005JN0T,"I, Robot may not be the best science fiction movie of all time, but it does have an interesting tale patched up with some Will Smith humor to make it an enjoyable one. The movie begin by telling us the three laws that all robots must obey. I. Robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm. II. Robot must obey orders given by a human being except where such orders conflict with the 1st law. III. A robot must protect its own existence as long as it does not conflict with the 1st and 2nd law. The setting is in Chicago in the year 2035 where robots are doing many jobs that us humans do today such as being garbage men, cooking, and helping old folks around the area. The creation of robots has the whole town delighted expect for one cop. His name is detective Spooner (Will Smith). Spooner doesn't trust any robots as he believes that they are the exact oppostie of what they are supposed to be. His believes become more evident as Dr. Lanning fell about 4 or 5 stories to his death who happens to be the one in charge of the making of the robots. Everyone preceives Mr. Lannings death as a suicide but Spooner begs to differ. He feels that the robots are responsible for his death. His believes pinpoint him to a robot called Sonny who is unlike the other robots. He can write, think, have emotions and even have dreams. Spooner feels that Sonny is the man responsible for Mr. Lannings death but noone wants to believe him especially since robots are machinery designed to protect humans. Eventually Dr. Susan Calvin (Lanning's assistant) begins to see a different side of Sonny she is not using to seeing and is finally convinced that the robots may not be what she perceived them to be. Detective Spooner's beliefs start to come to life when one robot tried to destroy Mr. Lannings house when he was in there trying to dig up clues and when he was driving and ran into a truck full of robots popping out and attacking him. Of course, Spooner has no evidence of what the robots did and begins to go into an outrage that leads him to being suspended from the police force. However, Spooner refuses to give up. He continues to confront Sonny to find out what's going on. Sonny reveals that he was part of Dr. Lanning's special creation and was not obligated to follow the three laws. Lanning made him to fulfill a purpose by what that purpose was, Sonny didn't really know. We discover many other interesting clues. The main reason why Sponner dislikes robots was because he had a an auto accident that caused a big truck to knock him and another car with a 12 year old girl off the bridge and into a river. A robot came and saved him because he had a greater chance of living although he begged the robot to save the girl instead.  We discover that the  mastermind in causing the robots to act the way that they are is not a person or a robot but Vicki (the computer system) that was supposed to program the robots to follow these laws but instead doesn't obey Dr. Lanning and now we have an army full of robots wrecking havoc all over the city. Now Sonny, Spooner, and Calvin must protect the city, destroy the robots, and destroy the Vicki. In the end, we discover that Dr. Lanning did instruct Sonny to kill him and use him to help Detective Spooner to destroy Vicki and her evil intentions. Sonny go out and lives the human life but it looks like he will be leading it in a positive manner. This movie may not be as fun to watch as the Matrix, Men In Black, or the Fifth Element, but the idea behind a robot murdering a human portrays in interesting story. I loved the parts where Spooner told one of the doctors that he was allergic to b.s. and the lead detective said he will miss the good ol' days when people killed people. I think it's worth checking out",1108512000,,3812,4.345021037868163
1516648,4,B00005JN0T,"The 2004 sci-fi action thriller ""I, Robot"" was inspired by a collection of short stories of the same name and written by Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) in 1950.  It was in this collection of sci-fi stories that Isaac Asimov introduced his three laws of robotics, which define for a robot its interactions with humans.  These three laws were the basis for the 2004 film's story, not the collection of short stories themselves.  This undoubtedly left left many theater patrons who have read Asimov's works disappointed with the film because unlike the short stories, the film's plot is built around a human character named Del Spooner (Will Smith), who is a technophobic police detective.  The film opens in the year 2035 with the apparent suicide of a brilliant scientist whose work in robotics has made the fictional company of ""U.S. Robotics"" more powerful than Microsoft could ever hope to have.  Called upon to investigate the suicide, Del Spooner personally knew the dead scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell, who played Dr. Zefram Cochrane in the 1996 ""Star Trek VIII: First Contact"").  However, Del's mistrust of technology, and especially robots, puts him at odds with the CEO of U.S. Robotics, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), who instead has him speak to one of Dr. Lanning's associates, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan).  While investigating Dr. Lanning's office at U.S. Robotics (where he is believed to have flung himself through a window), Del & Susan are startled when an NS5 robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) leaps from its hiding place.  Del is convinced that Sonny murdered Dr. Lanning, but no one believes him since that would violate the three laws of robotics that are programmed into every robot.  Further, such a situation would be highly embarrassing for U.S. Robotics, which is planning to release its new NS5 robots for use by the general public, who currently use the earlier NS4 models.  Undeterred, Del continues his investigation, but someone clearly doesn't like what he is doing as NS5 robots start to attack him.  The only question is who?

Having read so many poor reviews for ""I, Robot"", I was pleasantly surprised by the film upon having the opportunity to view it myself.  The special effects and cinematography are quite good, and the story itself, which was written by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, is entertaining even though it is not an actual Asimov work.  I do highly recommend the documentary included on the DVD that explains the making of ""I, Robot"". It was quite interesting to see how the robots in the film were created through a combination of live actors and CGI.  Though I understandably cannot necessarily recommend the film to Asimov purists, overall, I do rate ""I, Robot"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  People familiar with the 1994 film ""The Crow"" and the 1998 film ""Dark City"" will no doubt recognize director Alex Proyas' handiwork with ""I, Robot"".",1108339200,3,2905,4.98343685300207

It should be titled ""I, Will Smith"", starring Will Smith, co-starring Will Smith, and having a cast of some other people.

I spoke to other people and they all agreed that when this movie was being released, a pretty big deal was made out of it, because the budget to make it was pretty large.  It was rather disappointing on that scale.  The plot was mediocre, and I had my opinions on other ways that it actually should have taken.  It is pretty suspenseful throughout in a whodunnit kinda way, but I didn't enjoy the way it ended at all.  The visuals ARE amazing, and I was awed at the massive amounts of robots and computer effects.  All in all, the visuals and robots make this a great movie to look at, but the plot leaves something to be desired.",1108166400,2,779,4.194630872483222
1516652,3,B00005JN0T,"This film intrigued me because of the interesting premise about a robot accused of murder, which is something it supposedly cannot do.  That's because there are three laws that govern the internal programming of robots...one being that they cannot kill a human being, that their job is to protect human life.  So, the film hooks you by an intriguing premise then reels you in until they pull a switch on you (that old ""bait and switch"" standby) and the film leads elsewhere, and that's where it falls apart.

The first half of the movie is well done and quite intriguing.  Will Smith as Detective Spooner is investigating a strange death of the creator of these robots.  The dead man happened to have fallen out of a window, so everyone thinks its suicide.  Spooner suspects otherwise, because he has a history of hating robots.  Everyone else ""knows"" that there's no way a robot could commit murder because of the three operating principles.  So, we get an interesting storyline in which the robot is apprehended and interrogated.  The film has the look and feel of another film set in the future (Spielberg's ""Minority Report"").  In fact, to watch both films as a double feature would convince you that they take place in the same time period and place as one another.  I liked that about this film (because I'm a huge fan of ""Minority Report"").

Once the twist happens, the film goes into a different tangent and it all goes downhill from there.  Its a gimmick that I'm growing tired of...the old switcheroo.  Movie audiences are so sophiscated these days that Hollywood seems like they have to continually pull fast ones on moviegoers by making unexpected twists in the story just to throw people off from predicting the ending.  But by the end of this movie, who really cared?  The trailers sold it as one thing, the film resolves to something else entirely, and I couldn't help but feel ripped off and cheated.  This film wasn't so much a murder mystery, exploring the paradox of the three rules in regards to how a robot could commit murder, as it is a cautionary tale about the militarization of the country as it moves towards totalitarianism by use of artificial intelligence to do the dirty deed of preventing people from rising up against the corporate takeover of our government.  If that's what the film was about, they should have sold it as such, but don't string people along thinking its about a robot accused of murder, making it look guilty, then pulling a switcheroo to where the robot is actually a savior.  Lame.  I expected much better.  See ""Minority Report"" instead.  Its a more profound film.",1107820800,6,2619,4.747787610619469

I found myself wanting to watch it again within the next couple of days. The thought of the world being so technological has always fascinated me, but I have to admit, I can't make myself believe it's ever going to be quite as technical as this movie. It's kind of scary to think that we may one day depend on robots to do so many things, but who knows. I almost hope it doesn't happen in my generation. Flying cars and things like that are just a little to much for me. But, I give this 5 stars. It still amazes me how people think so extensively about the future.",1107820800,2,780,4.172185430463577

It's nothing new, but it tries, and it manages to be entertaining.

  When the president of a robotics company(James Cromwell) is found dead in his own lobby, supposedly from suicide, Will Smith's Detective Spooner is sent to investigate.  Using Isaac Asimov's story as a basis, the filmmakers took a typical whodunit motif and injected it with a sci-fi twist.  The futuristic setting is made more believable than most other science fiction movies I've seen, and the visual effects, although mainly constructed with the help of computer-enhanced technology, are quite good.  When these things are combined to make I, Robot, the results are very entertaining.",1107734400,,741,5.176470588235294
1516656,3,B00005JN0T,"I'm sorry. I don't believe that the Directorial Staff and writers of I, Robot really wrestled much with the purity of Asimov, Bradbury and Heinlein.

. . . from an idea . . .'

This is even more of a reach then that. Will Smith is actually a remarkable actor growing from a humble, 30-minute humorous quips (Fresh Prince) TV background. Now you can even say, 'he's the man.' And additionally, going back to the Ali days, he spends a lot of time in the gym. Because he is most assuredly,  buffed.

But that's it. Not a serious examination of AI, interesting dialogue (and that's all) between Moynahan and Smith, and a Lassie like slobbering grin from the Robot Character ""Sonny"" that we are left to assume (yes, theologians) has a soul.

Great special effects. Boring, predictable dialogue. The usual tedious quips the writers force Mr. Smith to make instead of just letting him act. NOTHING ELSE. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1107475200,,1121,4.422330097087379

They made it so people would understand the laws, then they made a story based off of that.

The acting in the movie was really good for the most part, there were some parts of the movie that i was like, ""so he just all of a suddent changed his mind about this robot after years of hating robots"" but i thought about it and figured out that he didn't hate robots, he hated the part of himself that *spoiler* was a robot, and the overall fact that the robots don't have a conscience about matters that would significant to us.

1516700,4,B00005JN0T,"When I first heard they were going to make a movie based on Asimov's robot stories, I cringed. My fears proved partly justified. The robots in this movie seem to have an additional law that requires them to provide an excuse for a chase scene and/or special effects every five minutes, regardless of how it affects their obedience to the other laws. And the attempt by the hero to explain what is wrong with the Three Laws of Robotics is pretty dumb.

But if you look past those kind of flaws, there is much that the movie does well. The questions it raises about the dangers of artificial intelligence are as thoughtful as Asimov's. The fears of job insecurity and many related aspects of human-robot relationships seem fairly realistic.

The movie makes it clear why we ought to be suspicious of the Three Laws. They virtually require that the robots, if they become smarter than humans, take over and do whatever is needed to prevent humans from suffering harm. Given a sufficiently good definition of ""harm"", that might be good. But given the difficulty that humans have agreeing on what constitutes harm (e.g. whether inequality is worse than poverty or job insecurity) and the frequency with which software has bugs, I would assume the robots have a poor definition of harm until proven otherwise. It's probably safer to simply make artificial intelligences obedient instead.",1107129600,,1381,4.897435897435898

OK so there are some gaping holes in the writing and for the sci-fi analysts this must drive them absolutely NUTS ... good ... for the rest of us we can just sit back and spend an easy going afternoon watching Will Smith in a stupendour 'eye candy' type of action flick. Will Smith playing the paranoid detective Spooner is fabulous .. I truly believe that Smiths artistic work is certainly not appreciateed today ....

1516702,1,B00005JN0T,"This movie centres on digital effects and considerable noise. There is the ghost of a story here and, like a ghost, appears unexpectedly at times but, again like a ghost, is difficult to see and vanishes quickly.

The movie holds your attention to a degree but in the way a series of explosions do. One goes off, then another then ... there's a pause, and then another. So when they stop you wait for the next one because you know it will happen shortly.

I suppose my biggest problem with the film is the digital look. It is so excessive you want to tear your hair out. The actors look like people lost in a Twilight Zone episode where they've found themselves in a huge video game.

As for the characters, it's fitting that James Cromwell plays a character who is seen only as a holographic image - something with no depth. This is pretty much what every character is.

It's hard to fault the actors given what they have to work with. In fact, Bridget Moynahan as Susan Calvin is quite good and effective given the little room she has to actually act. But she's about the only one.

For instance, there is the movie's star, Will Smith as Del Spooner . He appears to have phoned in his performance. But to be fair he has to spend the majority of his time being an action figure. But riding motorcycles and jumping from ledges is not acting. As an actor in I, Robot, he's a great stunt man.

1516703,4,B00005JN0T,"This is not your father's ""I, Robot.""  As the final credits explains, this movie has been ""inspired"" by the works of the late sci-fi grandmaster Isaac Asimov.  True, the three laws of robotics are clearly spelled out during the opening credits, yes, there are characters named Del Spooner, Dr. Calvin, and Sonny, but pretty much everything else is a traditional, modern summer blockbuster take on the ""misunderstood good cop against the system"" story.  They even have the infamous ""give me your badge"" line!

However, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Firstly, they have a nugget of brilliance by taking ideas from Dr. Asimov's works; secondly, they have a charismatic lead action star in Will Smith, who has buffed up considerably for this role (as a matter of fact, we see just how ""improved"" he is during an extended morning wake up scene right at the beginning of the movie); and finally, the special effects, although clearly CGI at times, are extremely well done and well integrated with the action.

Mr. Smith plays Chicago detective Del Spooner, who harbors a deep distrust and resentment towards the now ubiquitous robots in 2034 Chicago.  The script reveals via flashbacks that Spooner had a previous run-in with a perfectly well functioning robot that lead to less than perfect consequences.  Every time Spooner brings up his issues with robots, everyone around him raises an eyebrow and mention the inviolate three laws - and if you don't know them by now, you are probably locked up in a cave somewhere without internet access anyway ;-)

However, Spooner's fears seem to become reality when Dr. Lanning, the father of robotics, dies in an apparent suicide.  It seems that Dr. Lanning, played by the always exceptional James Cromwell, flung himself through a window in his 31st story office, where he was by himself...along with some robots.  Coincidentally, US Robotics (not the defunct modem maker), the company which Dr. Lanning founded, is about to roll out its newest robot model, the NS-5, which is smarter, has improved facial expressions, and can be updated wirelessly.  That an NS-5 robot named Sonny becomes Spooner's main suspect in Dr. Lanning's death raises the stakes considerably for all involved.

Dr. Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan, is assigned to assist Det. Spooner in the investigation.  She was a colleague of Dr. Lanning, and an in-house US Robotics expert in robot behavior.  Of course, there is the requisite suspicious industrial multi-billionaire, played surprisingly well by Bruce Greenwood given his brief screen time.

The movie includes some amazing set pieces, such as rollicking, physics defying clash in a freeway tunnel (just don't ask why the freeway is absolutely empty but for the key players, and how can a car do THAT, no matter how futuristic - I guess the screenwriters, too busy with the laws of robotics, forgot about the laws of physics), huge warehouses full of robots, and an amazing final showdown.

The video quality is beautiful, and the DTS soundtrack is, for lack of better words, powerful, with plenty of action for the surround speakers.  Special mention must be made of the set designs, where a near-future urban metropolis is realized in believable fashion - I applaud the decision NOT to have flying cars in this future city.

That said, the film is still enjoyable in it's own right as an action sci-fi. The effects are excellent, the pace spot-on, and the vision of the future convincing (actually aided by the many shameless product placements).

Based extremely loosely on the book of short stories by Isaac Asimov, this film is a crude assembly of action-movie cliches that somehow make an entire film.

In a near-future Chicago, robots are commonplace and something of a servant class, bound by the Three Laws of Robotics, which prohibits harm of humans and compels obedience.  When a robot apparently commits murder, the cop who investigates the crime finds something much more threatening afoot than a single homicide.

Executed well, this could have been a decent movie, but no one involved seems that interested in any real level of originality.  The writing is loaded with cliches, most prominently with Will Smith's cop character, a sullen but wise-cracking detective who has a deep dislike for robots.  You've seen the same character in a dozen other movies, as well as the wise-and-feisty grandmother, the hard-nosed police captain, the sinisterly pragmatic CEO and the idealistic-and-nave scientist.  The action sequences are also often comically stale, with slow-mo, Matrix-like effects that more intrusive than effective.

Unfortunately, the movie does have some good stuff; I say ""unfortunately"" because if it was completely bad, it would be more likely that this sort of movie would be rejected by audiences and we'd stop seeing these relatively tedious flicks.  But the special effects with the robots are often interesting and the story does become a bit more watchable in the last act.

But regardless of the few other mishaps, Will Smith's performance and personality with the great action scences makes up for it.",1106784000,,912,4.635802469135802

1516749,4,B00005JN0T,"While my taste runs to a more sophisticated type of film, there is no doubt that sometimes you just want to enjoy an old musical, adventure movie or spy thriller. This film surprised me because it's so doggone fun, yet brilliant in the quality of it's execution.

I admit that it took me a while to see this film because I did not care for the type of character that Will Smith has been known to portray... the half-smile ""doesn't take anything seriously"" wise-cracking type of buffoon. But since he has matured in body and attitude, he has developed into a different sort and I thought he was perfect for this role. Yes, his language is sprinkled with profanity and ghetto language, but it was just the gritty sort of ""real life"" manner this otherwise sterile vision needed. Without it, the film might have been antiseptic and unbelievable in scope.

After a few minutes of apprehension, I sat back and completely enjoyed this film. It's a romp, a lark, an adventure, and masterfully executed. If a person thinks this plot is predictable, and therefore unenjoyable, then I say ""what about 'Singing in the Rain', '42nd Street', ""Stagecoach' and a myriad of other films from our history that we consider to be classics?"" In other words, not every film has to be ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Gandhi"" to be enjoyable, interesting and entertaining. Good heavens, even doctors, university professors and the heads of government can enjoy the rides at Disneyland! Give me a break.

Will Smith has made some terrilbly weak films in the past... ""Independence Day"", ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Made in America""... the type of roles which had his goofy grin saying ""look at me, I'm so funny""... and his name in the credits for me was a warning that said ""stay away""... but a good friend urged me to see this film, and I am glad I did. In it, he is superb, tender, strong and likable. The special effects are amazing, innovative and convincing, the robot art direction by Oana Bogdan is magnificent, and last but not least, the performance by Bridget Moynahan is marvelous and authentic.

By the way, if you loved Issac Asimov's book, you might not be totally pleased, since most science fiction films taken from books, including this one, vary from the original. But not to worry, this film rocks. I highly recommend it as an engaging and thrilling ride.",1106438400,2,2328,4.726600985221675

This will be very popular with the U.S. masses.",1106438400,,332,4.15625

But this movie is pure fun: It has great caracters, great action, great humor and... Will Smitt.
He's perfect for the rol of the ""anti-robot-cop"" Dell Spooner, and plays his part with great humor, and great acting.
Bridget Moynahan also plays a great part as the beautiful doctor Calvin.

The action and the special effects in this movie are superb, great fun to watch. Like the cool car scene, and the endbattle are great.

Funny, Action Packed, Bad Dialouge...But looking past all that, this truly is a great action film. And, the special effects are great. When a movie like ""Scooby-Doo"" with horrible effects comes out, the effects are always what is brought up. I haven't even heard anyone mention the effects and they truly are marvelous. The movie is funnier than the second

""Men in Black"" movie too I might add with a joke with Will Smith sneezing and then saying ""Oh, i'm sorry. I'm allergic to bull****"" This may not seem funny to a lot of people but I found it hilarious. Smith plays Del Spooner. Spooner, is a paranoid homicide detective that doesn't trust any kind of robot. And when a scientist dies of an apparent suicide, Spooner suspects a robot named Sonny,who seems unique in comparison to his fellow robots. Besides the police chief, another person who thinks Spooner is crazy is Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, ""The Recruit""). This movie is truly taken for granted, I put it on my Top 10 List, that's how much I liked it. It wasn't at number 1 or anything but still... The only problem I had with the film was the dialouge. Some of it is just plain stupid and bad...

The lines and the emotion expressed while delivering the lines are just cheesy. Why give it 5 stars then? Cause, it is truly a brilliant film, the suspense, action, and comedy is carefully drawn out. It's terrific. A+.",1106179200,,1520,4.5236363636363635

There have been pleasant surprises, such as ""The Stand"" or ""The Green Mile,"" but usually movies based on books are a big risk.

Having said that, I have to admit that Alex Proyas' vision for this story was well worth watching.  He captured the whole conundrum that fans of SF have debated for decades: What constitutes ""life?""  What is intelligence?  What makes a soul?

Will Smith's character, Spooner, has an inherent distrust for robots, but finds in Sonny a friend who is willing to make sacrifices for those close to him, and for the greater good.

I agree that the use of the Three Laws of Robotics made ""I, Robot"" the obvious title, but there are also major elements taken from ""The Humanoids"" by Jack Williamson and ""Rossum's Universal Robots"" by Karel Capek (who actually coined the word, ""robot"" in his story.)

The story is fairly tight, and Will Smith is at his wisecracking best.  This is worth more than one viewing.",1105920000,,1188,4.561320754716981

1516816,4,B00005JN0T,"This is a very good film that is just a little bit away from being excellent.  The acting is spot on - particularly Will Smith, who would be the only American I could ever picture playing James Bond.  Even in a film like this where all of the actors around him have grim expressions and are deadly serious, you can tell that Smith is enjoying what he's doing, and as a result you enjoy riding along with him.

The plot of the film is relatively complex, involving a robot who may have killed his creator.  There are a couple of twists and turns near the end, but even the events that are unexpected won't floor you the way that most people were when they saw The Usual Suspects.  It is this lack of total surprise that makes this film very good instead of great, and is the major problem when you see that it is ""inspired by"" the Asimov stories, as opposed to based on them.  That said, even if you do see the major developments coming the first time you saw the film, it's worth watching I, Robot a second time because there are subtle clues embeded from almost the very beginning.

The DVD has a couple of special features, including a director commentary, that are mediocre; if you keep the subtitles on while you watch the commentary you are far more likely to become engrossed in the film again rather than listening to what the director had to say.

The bottom like is that the film itself is very good, the special features are nothing special, but if you like sci-fi, this is the best film to come out since Star Trek: First Contact, ironically, another James Cromwell film.",1105833600,,1582,4.412371134020619
1516817,4,B00005JN0T,"I think Will Smith is great on the screen.  Right off the bat, however, he does not need all the profanity his characters are spewing in the past several films.  That aside, this is pretty decent action film.  If you start thinking about Asimov because of the title and the three laws, you will likely hate the film.  However, if you can switch to Marvel Action Hero mode, then this film will seem superior.

Will Smith plays Del Spooner who is a troubled soul (like a Marvel Hero, right?).  He has a recurring dream that is increasingly revealed to us throughout the film and he hates robots.  He is almost a Luddite in his attitude towards technology and its effects on human work (the Luddites were 19th century workers from Leicestershire who destroyed the machinery that made them redundant and thereby demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of economic well being and increased productivity - but that is another topic).  For some reason he is close to the supreme scientist of robotics at U.S. Robotics.  He is called in when that doctor apparently commits suicide.  The detective story unfolds from there and the action continually increases in pace.

I do not want to reveal any more of the story because I think you will enjoy picking up the details for yourself.  Bridget Moynahan is pretty effective as the very closed robotics scientist, Susan Calvin.  And Alan Tudyk does a fine job voicing Sonny.  Tudyk was the pirate in Dodgeball and making the connection between the two roles is a testimony to his skills as a character actor.  Also, I want to single out Chi McBride. He is an excellent character actor who brings great presence and humanity to the roles he plays.  Here he plays Del Spooner's boss, Lt. John Bergin.  He is an important balance, protector, and foil for Spooner's extreme views and actions.  I mean everyone knows that Robots never commit crimes or hurt humans, right?

The animation of the robots is not as effective as it could be.  At certain points they look like so many computerized ants.  However, when you get past that, the movie does work pretty well.  Just remember, think Marvel, not Asimov, and you will enjoy it more.",1105833600,,2168,4.7560321715817695
1516818,4,B00005JN0T,"""I,Robot"" offers interesting hypotheses about man and his relationship to his creations but ultimately this film is essentially a popcorn film with some pretensions.  If it's primarily an action film then director Alex Proyas has achieved his primary goal of entertaining the audience.  If it is a serious exploration of the nature of artificial intelligence then it suffers somewhat in comparison to films such as ""Blade Runner"" and ""A.I."".  Will Smith continues to grow as both an actor and an action-star here.  His down-to-earth quality helps to cut through alot of the pretenses of the film.  The CGI effects are excellent here.  I feared at some point that the robot animation would overwhelm the flesh-and-blood actors on the screen.

I immensely enjoyed this futuristic action/drama about how the effects of a technology-driven society can lead to the decline of basic human need.  Out to prove otherwise, Will Smith did a good job in his role as detective Del Spooner.  He maintained his humorous roots, but also let us sample a slice of his more serious and dark side.  That being said, I've seen him do better.  The script could have been juiced up a bit as well; some scenes were pretty predictable.  Graphically speaking, there aren't many other action movies out there that can compare.

In this movie, which takes place in Chicago in the year 2035, robots have been created to improve the daily lives of humans; they deliver mail, pick-up garbage, and become man's best friend as long as they follow the 3 robot laws of safety: 1) A robot may not injure a human being, 2) A robot must obey the orders given to him, and 3) A robot must protect it's own existence. Every human trusts the robot except for detective Del Spooner(Will Smith). After a scientist named Dr. Lanning(James Cromwell) has supposedly committed suicide, Detective Spooner investigates his murder to prove that he was indeed killed by a robot. He believes that a robot named Sonny killed Dr. Lanning. Sonny is a unique robot who doesn't follow the 3 laws of safety and is a danger to society. But Sonny was indeed created for a purpose and will soon find out what that purpose is.

While I've never been a huge fan of Will Smith, he has starred in several fabulous movies.  This is one of them.  To his credit, he plays his role with convincing authority and also demonstrates a vulnerability altogether missing from most previous roles.

If you're a fan of CGI special effects, this is an absolute for your DVD collection.  However, the best news is that there is much more TO this film than the eye-candy effects!  That's something pretty rare to see in a high-budget FX film in this day & age.  As a matter of fact, I would argue that this film would STILL be worth seeing even if (hypothetically) it was made with 1960s technology.  However, for your FX fans out there, you can relax.  The FX this film has are nothing short of stunning.

This is an entertaining film with a flashy production value and an altogether charismatic leading man.  The fact that this film was directed by Alex Proyas (""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"") never entered into my decision to watch it.

I mean, Will Smith is the guy. He has shined through in so many big-budget block-busters in the past, it almost seems like he can make anything work. It's just too bad that up until now, he has been trapped in sequel Hell (""Bad Movie Boys 2"" and ""Men In Bad Movies 2"" are ones that come to mind). ""I, Robot,"" however, is a nice return to fresh form for Smith. It embraces all of the cliches that we've seen in other sci-fi/action movies, but makes it all seem so new and exciting. Smith plays Detective Spooner, caught in the year 2035 where robots and humans live in perfect harmony. The robots serve as servants to the human beings. Seemingly loyal, no one can find a kink in these magnificent machines -- which by the way, are gloriously designed, nice to see something besides ""Terminator"" clones -- except for, of course, you guessed it, Spooner. He is overly paranoid of these robots, and when the inventor of them is splattered all over the lobby of USR (if you can't guess what it stands for, stop reading) headquarters, Spooner instantly suspects a shady, ""unique"" robot by the name of Sonny of committing murder. The catch here is that according to the three robot laws, a robot basically cannot harm a human being. And thus, the set-up. The movie moves at a breakneck speed and it's really tough to tell what's coming up next. The action scenes are stunning, as the pace never really lets up. This is one of the few movies in it's genre that keeps the audience guessing. Will Smith is great in his role, and definitely pulls out all the stops with the character. It's nice to see him in such a well-made movie again. Reminds me of the glory days of the first ""Men In Black"" and ""Independence Day,"" movies that defined popcorn entertainment. Again, a lot of the movie has been done to death in other films, but this does well enough with the material that all is forgiven. The only real flaw I can find is that some key plot-points are difficult to catch, and unless you're watching it at home, where you can rewind, you're likely to get left in the dust. But overall, it's a great movie, with a timeless theme that I think everyone watching can appreciate.

If you're going to make a movie based on a book, at least do the decent thing and make sure it has at least more than one or two things in common with each other.

As soon as I walked out of the theater, I was immediately deafened by the outrageously loud noise that I later identified to be the sound of Isaac Asimov spinning in his grave. I was horrified to see that a movie based on a classic novel would turn out to be nothing more than a two hour long commercial for Converse, Audi, FedEx, Prudential, Mercedes, and Dos Equis.

This travesty has more product tie-ins than all three films in the Matrix trilogy. It was nothing more than an underhanded attempt to cash in on whatever's hip in modern pop culture by slapping a popular novel's title onto an amalgamation of everything that is cliched and overdone in today's film industry.

An awesome plot is ruined by unnecessary explosions, moan-inducing one-liners (I mean, 'Converse, vintage 2004?!?!' What the hell is that?), cliched characters, and the ever-present and inane face of Will Smith, who apparently feels that it is necessary to produce a monolopy on all summer movies.

Yes, Will, Independence Day was a great movie, but I still haven't forgiven you for Wild, Wild, West and Willennium.

It's still a decent flick to rent on a Friday night. Explosions, killer robots, and a hot female lead certainly make for a fun time, but I just wish that they removed all references to Asimov and had instead titled it something like, 'When Robots Attack'

Will Smith plays his typical role as a wise-cracking detective who is always just a little bit smarter then his co-stars.  Due to a accident in his past, he has an intense distrust of robots which have become common.  This distrust serves him well as he is assigned a closed room case where the only suspect is a robot which couldn't commit a murder due to the first law of robotics.  To continue would be to give away too much of the plot but just about every character is deeper then they appear while remaining true to themselves.

Will Smith plays a cop who has had past, unpleasant run ins with robots, and thus has some degree of paranoia surrounding them.  Soon his paranoia proves correct as he is 'attacked' by a rogue robot who has begun to take on elements of a soul.  The robot, named Sonny, becomes one of many clues leading Smith's character to the true threat presented toward humanity.

I found this movie to be surprisingly good for an action movie, with well developed characters and some nice action scenes.  Although not as spectacular as the Matrix Trilogy (especially Reloaded), I, Robot is high above most other movies of its kind.",1104796800,,1119,4.56
1516910,3,B00005JN0T,"This was actually better than I thought it would be.  There is a lot to like about the movie, with some heavy messages and very good special effects.  Exactly how did the good scientist who created the robots die, was it suicide or was he murdered and if so by who?  Could it have been robots programmed by a human or are the robots taking over and if so how can that be given the three prinipals that protect humans from harm?
This is a well thought out script, my only real problems are with the damn ""HOLLYWOOD"" moments with the hero flying through the air in slow motion with guns ablazing or the chase scenes with the hero oh so close to falling to his death while leaping to catch a precious object but just barely able to hang on (what a surprise).

But after reading more about it, I thought the film needed to be given a look; and was I not disappointed! I, personally, would consider this film to be one of the best in 2004 and very underrated. People say it is a special-effects extravaganza. But let me ask those people this question: How else are they going to pull all of that robot and futuristic stuff off?

Will Smith is just great in here and the story is one of the best I have seen in many years! The special-effects are great and it just keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire film!

This is a film I would recommend to anyone who loves movies! Whether you are a sci-fi fan or not, I am willing to bet, you will find this movie very enjoyable!",1104710400,2,874,4.159763313609467
1516912,3,B00005JN0T,"This was an impressive film.  Not from the standpoint that it was a great story or with great actors, it was the quickness of the plot that impressed me.  I don't normally say this, but the fact that I. Robot moved exactly to the points that needed to be moved without any misleading, poor back story, or cheesy Will Smith moments impressed me.  Director Alex Proyas knew exactly how to manage the excessively huge budget and make sure that we, the audience, were getting the biggest bang for our buck.  Yes, there were downfalls to this film, but somehow I could overlook them.  I will be the first to admit that this was not my favorite type of film.  The huge CGI scenes, the grossly overpaid actors, and the disrespect to one of Asimov's infamous books by the same title will really churn your stomach (as it did mine), but unlike the rest of these types of film, I, Robot did something different.  It kept the eye candy going throughout the film and really never let your eyes rest.  This very imaginative world, almost a fantasy world, had something to keep your eyes busy the entire time, and I loved it.  Whether it would be Will Smith's semi-plastic looking Audi, or the Sony created ""Sonny"" robots infiltrating the city, your eyes will definitely walk away from this film with bulging bellies and a desire for more.

Outside of the visually pleasing aspect of this film, you really don't have much to enjoy.  Will Smith's performance is mediocre at best.  He tries to do his best throughout the film, but after his introductory shower scene that was completely unnecessary it is only continually going downhill.  He tries to play the bad boy style that he patented in such film like Bad Boys to this project, what ultimately fails is his ability to handle the discrimination towards the robots.  I never really felt as if he actually disliked them, no matter what the sub-story claimed it just never felt real.  I think what ignited this feeling was Chi McBride's role.  Don't get me wrong, he is a decent actor, but he was trying to bring his role from Boston Public to this part.  He was trying too hard to be the hard-nosed Lieutenant that constantly fought with Spooner, but instead it just came across as Chi being Chi.  There wasn't anything exciting about him in the least bit.  Looking deeper into all the characters, this is what I felt was a major flaw with this film.  The actors really gave nothing spectacular to their roles.  They were minimally developed and several of them seemed like Swiss cheese.  It felt like wasted talent in this film.  Proyas knows better.  He knows how to get great performances from his people; I don't know what pulled him from his norm in this project.  Cromwell, Greenwood, and even Bridget Moynahan were just hitting that average line.  This was yet another glowing example of what happens when money is spent on CGI instead of highly trained actors.

So, it looks like we have a superbly visual film coupled with horrible, below the line acting.  What did you expect?  This was your average action film with superior CGI.  I mentioned before on how the visual work is what really kept my eyes glued to the screen, but there was one other element that just rattled my mind.  In an attempt not to give the ending away, I will say this much.  It is not happy.  I do not think that upon viewing the ending of this film you have this sense of joy and comfort knowing that everything is going to be hunky-dory.  It is as if you are viewing the beginning chapter to a much bigger story, and that was interesting to me.  Proyas is notoriously known for his subtle dark endings that keep you on the brink of wonder (see Dark City), and I, Robot was no exception.  It was a brief moment of excitement to see this ending, after a brutal battle sequence where your mind could literally fall asleep because you already know the results, you have this mind-bending ending that really creeped me out.  Perhaps I read the ending wrong, but I wasn't at ease when the credits rolled.  I snickered because I thought of what could be coming, but definitely not a jump-up-and-down with glee sort of moment.  It was strange, but beautifully Proyas.

Overall, this was a decent film.  I think I would reference this film similar to the way that I felt about the actors, it was just barely hitting the average line.  This was better than I expected (which isn't saying much since I was expecting it to be a dud) with really amazing visuals, but you cannot stand on those alone.  For this film to really have succeeded, you would have needed to counter balance the CGI with a better story (more details about the laws and more development with Cromwell's character) and much better acting.  I see why the producers went with Smith because he is bankable, but he just didn't bring the human element to the table like it was needed.  I couldn't see his hatred enough to really bring about his emotional change.  I needed more, but found less.  Decent, but nothing that will touch my DVD player again.

the downloads from the central USR computer (VIKI).  At least

the movie makes it easy to identify the unsafe robots by the

they're obeying a higher law: the misguided ""protection"" of

humanity.  In other words, an orderly utopian world without

violence, suffering, poverty, etc. except when robots need to

cause suffering or act violently for the greater good of society.

The chief robotic scientist, who developed the 3 laws and designed the first general purpose robots, commits suicide, or was he murdered by a robot?  Will Smith is called in as a detective who doesn't not like or trust robots, despite the rest of the world trusting them completely.  He follows the clues left to him by the dead scientist to solve the case.

As this film presents a contrast between advancing technolgy and an eroding societal infrastructure.  It is the flip side of the coin to Blade Runner, more positive but still not the best of futures.

The added irony to the film is casting Will Smith as the detective: a black showing prejudice toward mechanisms, which are developing self awareness and filling a slave role.  Sadly Will Smith seems to have one character, as he plays the role as he did in Independence Day, Wild Wild West and other films; aggressive, sarcastic, a brother with an edge.

It's just Will Smith in a movie about such and such.  With that said, back to my point, I was ready to hate this movie.  I was surprised to find that Alex Proyas directed this (as well as the superb Dark City) and the story (while not any kind of ground breaking Sci-Fi) was strongly rooted in the Sci-Fi and Mystery genres.  It unfolded well and was interesting, heck, even Will was good as Detective Spooner (Yes he gets props for actually acting, even if it was still just a sombre paranoid version of himself).  Ok, it had it's holes, but not too many.  Oddly enough it was the ""stylized"" action sequences that failed the story to me and they just seemed to be out of place in this straight forward Sci-Fi piece.  Also the Mystery side of it never really panned out.  The movie does have it's charm, though and if this is any indication of the status of the blockbuster movies coming out of Hollywood right now, then at least that's a good thing.

1516982,4,B00005JN0T,"Alex Proyas' ""I, Robot"" is an exhilarating, entertaining, fast-paced thriller starring the effortlessly charming Will Smith and the beautiful Bridget Moynahan (""The Recruit"", ""The Sum of All Fears"").  The story is fairly preposterous, involving, you guessed it, robots and their attempt to take over the world.  And of course Smith's character, Detective Del Spooner, knows that these robots are evil and no one will believe him.  The script is based on Isaac Asimov's book of short stories and co-screenwriter Jeff Vintar's (along with Oscar-winner for ""A Beautiful Mind"", Akiva Goldsman) original script, ""Hardwired"".

In this world of 2035, robots have come to play a vital role in the lives of humans, doing everything from bartending to laundry for their ""owners"".  The world is simply teeming with them and their numbers are soon to increase with the largest shipment ever of robots, the NS-5's.  Even though they are programmed to be incapable of injuring humans or committing a crime according to ""the three laws"", Detective Spooner is convinced they are up to no good and even tackles a robot he believes to be robbing a woman when he is actually rushing her an inhaler.  The three laws are:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

This is definitely a fun film that I enjoyed immensely.  The whodunit script will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat right to the end.  If you're willing to suspend reality for a few hours and not think too hard about what you're watching, I think you'll really enjoy ""I, Robot"".",1104451200,,1829,4.768253968253968
1516983,1,B00005JN0T,A big screen video game. No characterization. Effects that are  obviously computer generated. Such effects are inversely proportional to tension and anticipation. What a waste.,1104451200,7,176,6.04
1516984,4,B00005JN0T,"In the future people will have robots helping them with their daily lives, and these robots have three laws that they have to obey in order to keep mankind safe.

2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Robots fetch things when needed, they do the hard work at home such as cooking the meals and cleaning the homes.  Who would not like to have a robot, which would do the laundry and shopping while the owner could go about doing what they enjoy the most?  The freed up time would hopefully also lead to people searching for a greater meaning in their existence as they hopefully would not become more sedentary and cerebrally lazy.

There is one person, homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who wants nothing from robots as he takes pleasure in retro clothing as he wears throwback Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars and loves to turn up his stereo's volume loud, by himself, with a remote control.  Spooner's dislike for robots seems to stem from a recurring nightmare where a robot smashes in the car window and leads to him waking up drenched in sweat.  His dislike for robots borders prejudice as he wishes nothing from them as he only sees them as a threat to humanity.

At work Spooner's coworkers make fun of him and his distrust of robots as everyone is fully aware of the three laws of robotics.  Robots simply do not harm people as they never have or will.  However, the rules of robotics seems to have been broken when Spooner receives a personal phone call in regards to a suicide of the engineering genius, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell).  There is one robot, Sunny (Alan Tudyk), who displays feelings such as anger and confusion.  Sonny even admits that he has dreams, and he could even have been capable of murdering Dr. Lanning.

The investigation of Dr. Lanning's proclaimed suicide leads Spooner into a mesh of conspiracy theories as someone seems to be plotting to kill him as well.  Spooner realizes that he cannot do it all himself as he seeks help from an employee, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), of the U.S. Robotics who is specialized in psychology as she tries to make the robots more human like.  Together Spooner and Calvin set out to find out who is behind the so called suicide, but they seem to have stumbled upon something much bigger than they expected.

I, Robot is based on Isaac Asimov's stories where the robot-psychologist Susan Calvin is the main character in most of the stories.  The film is loosely adapted from the stories, unfortunately film does not deliver the same level of complexity as the stories.  The film should have given Asimov more credit than what it did as Asimov was not just a writer, but also a futuristic philosopher who created the three laws of robotics as he was tired of reading about evil robots.  Nonetheless, the film addresses several interesting notions such as Descartes' ""I think, Therefore I am"", the philosophical and psychological aspect of consciousness, and evolutionary philosophy.

Alex Proyas has previously displayed his cunning skills in creating a haunting futuristic atmosphere in Dark City (1998), which is a brilliant cinematic experience.  In I, Robot Proyas brings current Chicago into a futuristic landscape where the audience still can see the Sears Tower and the Hancock Building.  However, the tallest building in the film belongs to U.S. Robotics, which is located somewhere between the two older skyscrapers.  The Chicago touch brings the film closer to the audience as the can identify with the story, especially if you live in the Chicago.  For example, the West Loop area seems to have gone through a great change, which is currently underway as well.

I, Robot is a breathtaking action adventure placed in the future where deep conspiracies brew underneath the surface.  The story line interchanges between dangerous stunts, cool CGI effects, entertaining one-liners, and lethal car chases while being subjected to a science fictionalized philosophy.  However, the notions presented in the film have already been presented through HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey), Ash (Alien), and Red Queen (Resident Evil) to name a few.  Regrettably, the use of similar themes hurts the overall cinematic experience, and if the film had remained true to Asimow it might have been a brilliant film.

It is not based on any one of the stories from the collection, choosing instead of add a newer tale still firmly establishing itself in the premise of the book:  The three Laws of Robotics.

The three laws are: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

In this new visual tale, Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) has a deeply seated, personal prejudice against robots, saying himself that they are nothing but wires and lights.  When Dr. Alfred Lanning (the wonderful James Cromwell) unbelievably commits suicide, Spooner finds himself in an investigation that is not only tangled with conflicts against the laws of robotics, but also places his life in danger.

Susan Calvin (expertly played by Bridget Moynahan) is a robot psychologist who finds Spooner's story ridiculous but detrimental to the impending release of the new NS5 robot series.  Together they capture Sonny, an NS5 that was present at the time of Dr. Lanning's death, and discover that he not only behaves in a manner peculiar to robots, but that he has dreams; something robots are not capable of.

The plot takes off, with Spooner and Calvin searching for the meaning and the menace behind this aberrant behavior emerging in the new NS5's.  All Lanning left behind him was a ""trail of bread crumbs"", clues that Spooner must decipher, beginning with a copy of the Hansel And Gretal book left behind at the scene of his death.

The special effects in this movie are stunning, sometimes going over the top but still blending in nicely with the futuristic theme.  What I found surprisingly unique and pleasing is that they used slow motion effects even in the CGI scenes, filming the robot fights in a way that has been done only with live actors before.  That was cool.  The buildings, the modes of transportation, the robots, the explosions, all were spectacular effects but did not overpower the theme of the movie or the talent of the cast.

Will Smith brings his toughness and humor to the screen with his usual finesse, but to me it was Sonny the robot who captured the screen.  There was a great deal of chemistry between Spooner, Sonny, and Calvin, that balanced out the FX with human interaction and fine performances.  Adrian Ricard deserves a mention here for her role as Granny also, properly chastising the cocky Spooner in a way neither his Captain or Calvin could do.

""I, Robot"" begins with an apparent suicide of an engineer pioneer for U.S. Robotics.  Detective Spooner (Will Smith) is sent to investigate.  Spooner has a reason to be suspicious of labor robots. Is that why he was chosen as the lead investigator? Someone is trying to leave him clues to a classic robot mystery. (Who operates the robots?)

 The NS4 robots are about to replaced with the newer updated model NS5s. Everyone wants and gets one.  Hold your flux capacitor, those pesky NS5 models have a secret. One NS5 model (Sonny) is the prime suspect. What. A robot.

The NS4 robots have three rules: Rule #1,Obey humans, Rule #2, Protect humans from harm! Rule #3, everything else not covered by Rule #1 and 2.

 Of course human nature must tend its ugly hand. Detective Spooner and Director of Robot Relations Susan (Bridget Moynahan) join forces to destroy (Not kill) the NS5s.

Is this film a premonition of the future of our society?  The labor robots do everything from cooking, cleaning and pleasure dealing for humans. Who cares! Can I get one now!

1517027,4,B00005JN0T,"First of all, I haven't read Isaac Asimov's ""I, Robot,"" so I don't have any basis on which to compare the book to the film.  However, I have watched many science fiction flicks.  I enjoy adventures such as the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, action flicks like the recent ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse,"" and the type of sci-fi that leaves you in a reflective mood, such as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""

I expected ""I, Robot"" to lean towards the ""Resident Evil"" genre of sci-fi.  Plenty of shoot'em up action and brainless explosions that are good for a Sunday afternoon, but won't expect you to think too much.  Add to the fact that Will Smith is in the starring role, and I expected the action to be hopped up on streetwise, smarty-pants humor.  Imagine my surprise when, after viewing the film, I was amazed at how really good this flick is.

Granted, it is full of fast-paced action that any Playstation fan would jump with glee for, but it also has a really great murder mystery aspect to it that leaves you questioning just who the bad guy really is.  Also, Smith's token smart mouth is toned down a little, and I actually enjoyed watching him on the screen.  He seems to have finally matured into an adult, and his face is finally showing a little age, which makes it easier to believe in him as a toughened cop.

The story starts out with Smith's character, Spooner, investigating the murder of a brilliant scientist responsible for introducing personal robots into society.  These robots provide companionship, do manual labor, and serve as all-around go-to's when needed.  Of course, Spooner believes this reliance on robots is only the beginning of something horrible down the road.  He immediately suspects one of the newest robotic creations to be the murderer of the good doctor.  He, along with a fellow employee of the deceased doctor, goes out to find who or what did the deed and why they did it.  What follows is a quickly paced action film that has plenty of intelligence for the viewer with an I.Q. above the average moviegoer.

The story does start out somewhat slow, but it picks up about thirty-minutes in on both the action and intellectual levels.  Don't worry, you can still watch this as a brainless flick, but its story is so good that you'll be hard pressed not to follow it.

The special effects are fun to watch.  It is amazing how life-like the robots are.  Sonny, the murder suspect, manages to win over even the toughest critics with his human emotions and actions.  I forgot that he wasn't real while watching the movie, making this story that much easier to digest.

The DVD itself is sparse on extras.  There is a little ""making of"" documentary and a stills gallery.  There's also a commentary provided for those folks who have nothing better to do.  Honestly, I glance at some extras on DVDs, but I hardly look at them more than once.  If you're like me, you won't miss the movie trailers, cast filmographies, or other fluff that is sometimes put on these discs.  I buy these things for the films on them, not to learn why certain scenes are left on the cutting room floor.

In closing, buy this flick if you like intelligent murder mysteries with a twist.  If you like sci-fi flicks in general, this movie won't let you down.  If you're an action fan, this motion picture has plenty of that, too.

Highly recommended.",1104192000,3,3361,4.6440677966101696

The film is inspired by a collection of short stories written by Isaac Asimov, one of the literary giants of the Science Fiction genre.  Anyone who has read Asimov's work, knows that these tales were thought provoking, intelligent, and literate.  However, whenever the latest would-be blockbuster hits cineplexes trumpeting the phrase ""starring Will Smith,"" the words  ""thought-provoking"", ""intelligent,"" and ""literate"" don't exactly spring to mind.

Smith has, after all, built his career on starring in  movies that downplay the science in their fiction.  Judging from the pre-release trailers shown in theaters this summer, ""I, Robot"" looked to me like your typical big, dumb, loud Will Smith action movie.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised.

Yes, ""I, Robot"" features its fair share of chases, explosions, and big action set pieces but it never asks it viewers to park their brains at the door.  And, believe it or not, the movie IS thought provoking, intelligent, and literate.  At the same time, it also kicks ass.

Smith gives one of his best performances ever as Robophobic cop Del Spooner who patrols the not so mean streets of Chicago circa mid-21st Century. Yes, he is still basically playing the same cool brother who saved the world in ""Independence Day,"" the MIB movies, and the ""Wild, Wild West"" but here his swagger are tempered with an underlying sadness and bitterness that makes for a well-rounded character.

The movie also savors the delicious irony of an African-American cop who engages in a form of racial profiling against androids.  In one hilarious scene, he jumps what he takes to be a purse-snatching robot running down a street.  Turns out the robot had just fetched the item for his master.

The movie also boasts an exceptional supporting cast in Bruce Greenwood, who plays the head of  USR world's largest robot manufacturing firm, James Cromwell, a leading robotics professor whose apparent murder at the hands of a robot kicks off the story,  and Chi McBride as Spooner's commanding officer.

Also notable, is Bridget Moynahan, as Dr. Susan Calvin, another USR prof who winds up assisting Spooner in his investigation.  My only regret here is that the movie doesn't go all the way and let Spooner and Calvin wind up a couple.  By the end of the movie, she's giving him so many longing glances that you just know that had the Spooner role been played by say Colin Farrell or Ben Affleck, these two would wind up in bed before the credits roll.  But alas,  mainstream Hollywood movies still seem uncomfortable with the idea of interracial romance.

Also deserving a shout out is director Alex Proyas, a  who always brings a unique visual flair to his films.  Proyas previously directed ""The Crow"" and the underrated  ""Dark City.""  Though last year's rock comedy ""Garage Days"" was something of a stylistic departure, ""I, Robot"" sees him back in the realm of the fantastic.

Though the film doesn't have quite the ""wow factor"" of his earlier work,  it's still good-looking enough to maintain his reputation as a visual genius.

""I, Robot""  probably won't appeal to die-hard Asimov purists,  many of  whom will likely view it as a bastardization of the great man's work.  But there's no getting around the fact that this is a fun movie that is smarter than the average blockbuster.",1104192000,,3363,4.934046345811051
1517029,2,B00005JN0T,"Let me put it plainly: this movie gave as much of a hard time as Swordfish and A.I. combined, two of my least favorite movies in recent times. It feels like a waste of a good story and some great acting (Will Smith's) on a poor screenplay where the effects are (sometimes) the only interesting thing in the movie (the reason I don't give it 1 star only). Never mind the product placement which becomes fairly annoying after a few minutes... The movie goes into unbelievable mode far too quick, plus it has a tough time retaining your attention.

For the record, I am not an outright critic of SciFi. I am a fan of the genre, but movies such as Bladerunner and more recently, Minority Report, really do it justice. And I LOVED Alex Proyas' work with ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"", but ""I, Robot"" instead felt more like ""Oops, Robot"". Do yourself a favor and skip it altogether.",1104019200,7,873,4.45625

Will Smith, who plays Detective Spooner, dislikes robots for personal reasons and is not surprised when trouble erupts between humans and robots, after the death of their creator.

The movie becomes quite intense as he finds out the robots are planning to take over mankind, for their own good of course!

This is a great movie full of suspense and adventure and a really good storyline that holds your interest through the entire movie.  I recommend this one for the entire family.",1104019200,3,662,4.53781512605042
1517031,5,B00005JN0T,"Rip roaring fun and an interesting premise.

Will Smith plays LA detective Del Spooner in 2035 faced with a what appears to be at first a suicide at USR - the main robotics manufacturer on the eve of the introduction of a new revolutionary robot model the NS-5. During the investigation Smith starts to believe the a robot, one of the new ones murdered the dead scientist and mad eit only appear to be a suicide.  Spooner has ""issues"" with robots in general, and wants to charge the robot with murder.

I'll leave the rest of the plot for those of you who have not seen the movie yet, but I have to say that this film doesn't let up for a minute. Will Smith solidifies his bone-fides as a credible action star (and has been obviously spending a lot of time in the gym lately) and really makes the movie.

Smith was an excellent casting choice as was Bruce Greenwood - always one of my favorite bad-guys when he does bad guys, few do it better. I won't elaborate for this movie whether or not he was bad guy - they'll be no spoilers in this review.

I really liked the way they gave the robot intelligence and emotions. I haven't watched the bonus tracks yet to see exactly how it was done but they somehow merged the CGI with the acting of Alan Tudyk ( Firefly ) for great blend of HAL seriousnes and Mr Data's (STNG) quest to understand himself. (

 for ther record  I am not a STNG fan, but I recognize that it was good in certain areas, nonsense in others. Mr Data was one of the better points of the series)

I wish there had been more of this exploration of philosphy. For example my favorite lines from the filme were during a conversation between Spooner and Sonny:

Spooner: You are a clever imitation of life... Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot take a blank canvas and turn it into a masterpiece?

Sonny: Can you?

This line summed up the conflict between Spooners idea of what a robot should be ( a toaster , It's just lights and clockwork."") against his inner conflicts and prejudices. How do you charge a microwave oven with murder?

Direction was tight and focused on the story and the characters. I was pleased to see Bridget Moynahan although the part underutilized her talents. Special effects were as expected, and I guess that says a lot about the state of visual effects today. They were as real as real gets and I guess thats we expect these days. Imagine though this movie being shown even 10 years ago, but say in 1975. What would the movie-goer think? I submit that the movie goer would believe that we will have intelligent robots acting in movies in 2004.

I loved the cars too. Audi did an excellent job of conceptualizing cars 30 years from now. Not that I expect they will actually look like that in 2035 but I believe they could look like that - which is what a movie requires.

Overall I highly recommend this movie. It's science fiction no denyng that, but what real sci-fi should be. Thoughtful, believable stories about characters you can care about set in a futuristic backdrop with amazing gadgets yet still playing mainly on the human element - even the robot's human element.

These are the sci-fi concepts invented by Jules Verne and perfected by geniuses like Isaac Asimov and A.C. Clarke. I am sure Asimov would have been proud at what they did with his concept and story. I've been reading Asimov for 40 years and felt right at home with this story. Too bad he is not alove to enjoy this wonderful variation of his original story.

This is a not miss. I bought this one an expect to enjoy it many more times.",1104019200,4,3558,4.407633587786259
1517032,4,B00005JN0T,"I, Robot is science fiction at its very best. While it may have looked like just another summer blockbuster in the trailer it is far from it in reality. The story at its core is quite profound, and the fact that an artificial intelligence could determine that mankind could not be trusted with its own survival does have a distinct sense of irony. There is a part of me that does sympathize with VIKI - you have but to look at the 6-o'clock news on any given day to see why. The world is constantly in turmoil but then again who's to say that a machine could do any better.

The special effects of I, Robot are quite simply amazing. The robots seem to blend seamlessly into the world around them so much so that there is seldom a moment where the reality of the film is ever questioned. The animation of Sonny in particular is truly astonishing - the subtleties in his performance remarkable. As you may well have guessed the process in which Sonny was brought to life was almost identical to that of Gollum from Lord Of The Rings.

The performances too are top shelf - Will Smith brings a great deal of personality and humour to a role which could have potentially been a stock standard affair. Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood and James Cromwell also put in a great performances, but perhaps the highlight performance is from the only lead actor you never see in the flesh (except for one frame as explained in the second commentary track). Actor Alan Tudyk's performance as Sonny is inspiring to say the least and as you will see in the behind-the-scenes material it was his performance which drove the animation of Sonny, right down to the minuscule facial movements.

The icing on the cake is that the film is also directed by  Alex Proyas, whose previous directorial efforts include The Crow, Dark City and most recently Garage Days. I, Robot is a sensational futuristic thriller that will for many years stand tall in the science fiction genre. If you liked Minority Report then I, Robot is a film for you.",1103846400,4,2014,4.570637119113574

5) What is up with the director having to try and flaunt Will Smith's physique?!? Shower scene, running around in briefs, a woman caressing his bare chest...is this some lame attempt to draw the female crowd into an action flick?

Right after Viki gives her last memorable speech of how the human race is run by self interest, self involvment and self everything (which is primarily true), they decide to shut her down and kill her because the truth hurts.  My main question in this movie was, who's the good guy and who's the bad guy?  By the end of the movie, I wanted Will Smith's character dead and his little counter part's character to suffer too.  Not that the robots were anything to cheer about either.  Their faces were enough to punch, and their pompous laid back attitude is what's wrong with humanity in the first place.  I was more intrigued with the first stage robots.  They had kind faces and hearts of gold.  A big problem I had with this movie was the miscasting of Will Smiths character and the fact it ripped alot of the premise of the film off ""Blade Runner"".

That being sad, on its own merits this is a very good movie and it's not just some summer movie blockbuster.  Will Smith is, as usual, very good.  The robot special effects are out of sight.

The latter two are barely existent in the film and, in my opinion, that's a good thing. I, Robot is a movie meant to work as a summer popcorn flick, and it definitely does.

Will Smith, who carries so much charisma with him that he's impossible not to like in whatever role he takes on, is pretty much perfect in the film's lead role, Detective Del Spooner. Bridget Moynahan, as Dr. Susan Calvin, though, is absolutely awful. Granted, she's a lot of fun to look at, and maybe we needn't be asking more of anyone in a popcorn flick, but I found her performance to be bad to the point of annoyance. The special effects, especially those concerned with the robots' facial expressions, are exceedingly well done and worth the price of a rental on its own.

The plot is simple, but has enough action and plot twists to keep you entertained.  The car race scenes are exciting (only in that Del Spooner takes on an army of robots), if not somewhat unbelievable.  The special effects are reminiscent of ""Tron"", which proves that Hollywood could have done a lot better.  In any event, the ending wraps things up nicely and proves that it might not be the end of the world and there are good robots and bad robots - just like people.  Enjoy the ride.

1517093,4,B00005JN0T,"The movie starts by showing the Three Laws of Robotics. They appear within what are the workings of a robots positronic brain. Though taken from a number of short stories by Isaac Asimov, do not expect it to be faithful. It is a fast paced detective story. Filled with action and many great special effects.

Will Smith plays our detective, Del Spooner, and suspects a robot of murder. He believes a robot, called Sonny is the murderer. Though no one else can even conceive of such a concept. He follows a trail of clues that leads him toward solving the case. Will is his usual self in this movie...just in better shape.

In contrast, we have Dr. Susan Calvin played by Bridget Moynahan. She believes that Sonny did not commit murder. For it would violate the main law of the Three Laws of Robotics, that is hardwired into each robot. She starts off true to the Asimov character, but evolves, as all good characters should in a good movie.

Though a Sci-Fi/Action Adventure movie. Its plot is that of a murder mystery. And in that aspect, I think this movie was well done. And you will be thrown a twist during the course of the movie.

Just suppose the world is a little, not a lot, more surprising than you think it is, and that could happen. That movie has enduring quality. The Nicole Kidman remake of ""Stepford Wives"" is played as tongue-in-cheek and it's not scary and it's not even any good.

Will Smith gets better every year. He msde this splendid movie ""I, Robot"" happen. He's a fine actor but a better producer, and to him we owe gratitude for advancing the literature of the cinema. It's a great movie, and conceptually profound. We ""intelligent"" wet-brained primates construct a marvelous apparatus, with unexpected capabilities and implications, that gives new scope to our emotions. It joins classics ""Pinocchio"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Forbidden Planet"" and others, exploring that familiar theme from a previously little seen aspect.

But oh... the fatal flaw... The ""action"" scenes just aren't believable. Dozens of robots attacked Spooner repeatedly. He shot and ruined them all with the endless ammunitiion from his gun. And then there was the Evel-Knievel scene with the motorcycle in the air. All that stupidity would better have been left on the cutting room floor. What's the point? Creating a few screenshots for the ""I, Robot"" video game? It's like putting a Formica surface on a Marie Antoinette dressing table. It will cost ""I, Robot"" an Oscar.

Will, I love you anyway, but sorry. You may be remembered eternally for what history may yet judge as a cinematic masterpiece. You may join the pantheon with Steven Speilberg, Howard Hawks, Ridley Scott, John Ford, David Lean, George Lucas. But I think it more likely the consensus will rank this movie slightly lower than a Guy Hamilton 007 flick.

Imagine if Spooner had just been portrayed as something a real human might possibly be. The plot could have had him personally and luckily defeat two, or maybe even three robots. Then we could have believed that, if the world had a little more surprise than we might have expected, the  story of the movie might some day come true. It would have chilled us to the bone. It could have started a political movement of neo-Luddites. It could have landmarked a new age of cinema, and Will Smith would be remembered forever.

More than a smidgen of that dangerous attitude infuses the cyborg menace in the terrifically entertaining I, ROBOT. Using only Asimov's title and the premise of once obedient and safe but now seemingly sentient robots run amuck, this possibly prescient action film stars Will Smith as a paranoid cop investigating a murder involving a robot.  Are his fears of a powerful robot army of workers who turn against their human owners coming true?

Asimov may have been writing about the dangers of artificial intelligence, or a metaphor for the Communist Revolution, or perhaps an Orwellian warning about  the power of labor unions -- but don't worry, this film does not get sidetracked with any preachy scenes and in fact the screenplay by Akiva Goldman is all the more powerful because it includes just enough tantalizing intellectual moments to perfectly balance the outstanding visceral energy of the visuals.

I think the golden rule when it comes to envisioning the future is that the more things change, the more things stay the same.  I understand that movies are a visual medium and must fill the screen with new and exciting images, and because of that I forgive I,Robot some of the extraneous machinery.  But would someone please steer Hollywood away from the semi-transparent white plastic veiw of future devices?  We have all seen an Apple computer, and that look is already becoming dated.

1517156,4,B00005JN0T,"There are several very good reviews already written on this movie, `I, Robot', most of which accurately point out the fact that, as the movie admits itself in the credits, is only loosely based on the collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov. I'm prompted to write a review of the DVD, because while all these reviews talk about the movie, none of them talk about the DVD.

The most important thing about this package is that while it does not include a lot of special features a la `Matrix' and `Lord of the Rings' blockbusters, it does include my favorite feature, which is an alternate soundtrack containing commentary by the writer and the director. This single feature automatically doubles the value of the package as it gives an excellent reason to watch the movie a second time. I really prefer the alternate soundtrack approach to the captions commonly done with older movies, as there is typically much more information given and you can get much more from the intonation of the speakers than you can from the sterile text.

That said, I believe the commentary soundtrack on this DVD is not as good as some of the best I have heard. My favorite is those by Kevin Smith, who has been known to supply two different commentary tracks and almost always has a symposium of three or four voices joining his own. A fairer comparison may be to the commentary track on Quentin Tarantino's special edition of `Pulp Fiction'. As both Smith and Tarantino are well known for including obscure `quotes' and references in their flicks, their commentary tracks are especially useful in revealing all the connections.

As this movie is loosely based on a justly famous collection of short stories and liberally quotes from other Sci Fi classics such as `2001' and the 1930's Czech play `Rossum's Universal Robots (R.U.R)', this commentary track should be a goldmine, but it is not. While the speakers mention or allude to these references, they give very few concrete connections. I'm convinced that the actor who did the voice of `Sonny', the primary robot character took his queue from the voice of HAL in `2001', but the commentators give me no satisfaction. As the play R.U.R. is a much bigger source for the plot, I was a bit disappointed that this connection was not explored more fully.

As there is a direct connection between Will Smith and Kevin Smith, as Will Smith had a cameo in Kevin's last movie, `Jersey Girl', I must point out that both Kevin Smith and the principles of `I, Robot' both have immense respect for Will Smith's talent as a professional movie actor in both courtesy to others and in his artistic contribution to the script and the quality of his improvisations on screen.

On the other hand, I found the Susan Calvin character (played by Bridget Monaghan) to be almost entirely uninteresting. She would have been much stronger if she had been played as originally written by Asimov or closer to the Sean Young character in `Blade Runner', the movie I sense the authors were trying their darndest to match. They didn't even come close, primarily, I suspect due less to Will Smith's weakness than to the failure to match Ridley Scott's powerful world based on the great inventions of the original material's writer, Philip K. Dick. `I, Robot' had no hope of matching `Blade Runner', as the latter was much less an action / FX opus than a classic Sci Fi `what if' premise grafted seamless to a film noir atmosphere and imaginative Pacific Rim fusion Los Angles. The driving force of `Blade Runner' is the fact that the androids are designed to die after four years. Asimov's great invention of the three laws of robotics are useful as wallpaper, but do not, ultimately explain the action in the film. They are a red herring used by characters to doubt what is really going on. Oddly, while I found the acting behind the primary robot, `Sonny' to be very good, the writing for this character was very inconsistent. And, inconsistency is highly implausible in a computer-based life form. I was expecting something much closer to the character R. Daneel Olivaw from Asimov's two early robot detective novels, `The Naked Sun' and `The Caves of Steel', where the phobias of the principle human are much more consistent with the world posited by Asimov for the stories.

This is certainly a worthwhile Sci Fi movie, although not in the class of `Blade Runner', `Minority Report', or even that great old classic `Forbidden Planet'. Good for a fun evening and a worthwhile second viewing with the commentary track.",1103414400,,4529,4.8
1517157,4,B00005JN0T,"I found Will Smith's acting to be a little overdone but other than that, this is a good action film.  Smith's tough guy swagger reminded me of John Travolta's walk in Saturday Night Fever.  It was totally out of place but I should note that he is still growing as an film artist and developing his talents.  This is a CGI driven film and those effects do not fail to please.

Smith's role is one of a homocide detective that hates robots.  His job is to investigate a murder that he suspects has been committed by a robot.  Robots are programmed with the 3 laws (see the film) so it's inconceivable to folks that a robot could have committed murder.

It's a nice murder mystery type of film with a twist.  The usual warnings about robots apply. The special effects are great.

Smith is so bad, that you have to wonder if acting with computer generated robots was a factor -- but that shouldn't be it, since he's been in a number of films with loads of special effects, and done pretty well for himself. Smith's performance is off, in the sense that he always seems distracted or even bored. It's like he's always cutting a look toward a mirror -- yep, pecs look good. On the good side of things are the robots. Their faces are remarkable in their ability to convey emotion. The trailers for the film don't do them justice. The plot is kind of muddled, but there are a couple of standout action scenes, in particular the chase in the tunnel, that help to raise this movie into the should-see category. But a few good scenes do not make a good movie. Probably the most over-hyped movie of the last year.  Note: Will, take an acting class.",1103414400,2,938,4.416184971098266
1517159,4,B00005JN0T,"First let's get the obvious out of the way from the start; ""I Robot"" although it incorporates elements from some of Asimov's Robot stories has little to do with the short story collection of the same name beyond the character of Dr. Susan Calvin. In fact, ""I Robot"" began as a homage to Asimov and an original screenplay entitled ""Hardwired"". When director Alex Proyas (""Dark City"", ""The Crow"") became involved things changed and the screenwriter incorporated more elements of Asimov's stories from the collection once Fox acquired the rights to the title. The only true adapation of Asimov's stories was done by Harlan Ellison in his marvelous unproduced screenplay of the same name.

""I Robot"" has all the right elements for a great Science fiction/mystery film and, although it doesn't achieve the greatness Proyas so clearly was shooting for, he and the writers on the film have done an admirable job at creating a fun bit of entertainment.

Chicago Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates the murder of Dr. Alfred lanning (James Cromwell)at U.S. Robotics. Spooner, who detests and doesn't trust robots (an idea borrowed perhaps from Asimov's novel THE CAVES OF STEEL). All leads point to a robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) as the murderer. Dr. Susan Calvin (a character from Asimov's ""I Robot"" short stories played by Bridget Moynahan)doesn't believe its possible for Sonny to have killed Dr. Lanning as it would violate one of the Three Laws of Robotics ingrained in every robot as a moral compass or conscience. When machines mysteriously try and kill Spooner and Lawrence Robertson the head of U.S. Robotics tries to kill the case Spooner is building, he becomes suspicious and does some digging discovering far more than he expected about why the murder occurred and who killed Lanning.

Visually stunning, Proyas film captures some of the flavor of Asimov's stories although it seems most indebted to Phillip K. Dick's stories and novels (as was Proyas film ""Dark City"") that deal with androids that develop self awareness. Smith gives a solid convincing performance while Moynahan's performance as Susan Calvin brings life to a character that is sketchy in the screenplay. Nevertheless, the director has created a stylish, involving action film perfect as escapist entertainment. Although the subplot involving Spooner's ""racism"" regarding robots was a bit heavy handed, it works creating a character that's suspicious of the ""good intentions"" of robots.

The DVD looks particularly good although I'm a bit mystified as to why it wasn't released as a two disc set here as it was in other regions of the world. Because all the extras are are on the same disc as the movie, there are more compression artifacts that one might expect resulting in picture quality a grade or two below what one might expect from a movie like this. Overseas, the film had only the film and multiple commentary tracks on one disc with the extras on a second disc (with many more than the ones included here). My guess is that Fox will release a ""Special Edition"" somewhat down the road to double dip the fans like many other companies have been doing.

The extras are solid if unspectacular with a glimpse behind-the-scenes and into how the FX were created for the movie. Again, more could and should have been done. The packaging with the seep through plastic sleeve is clever.

Although the film doesn't quite live up to the hype generated by the terrific trailers Fox used to sell the film, ""I Robot"" is an engaging, interesting murder mystery with some nice twists and elements from Asimov's stories thrown in for good measure.",1103414400,,3625,4.983471074380165

1517162,4,B00005JN0T,"I am, and have long been, a great fan of Isaac Asimov's and the movie I, Robot is a fantastic rendition of what Asimov's vision of robots, AI, and their relation to humanity.

Isaac Asimov was unique in that he rarely wrote a story in which robots were simple machines. His tales almost always involved the quest for, or the questioning of, humanity. I, Robot captures this quest for the soul fairly well, and still manages to mesmerize with great special effects and action sequences.

The acting is all very well done, and one of the most interesting characters is, strangely enough, the computer-generated robot Sunny. We find ourselves identifying with Sunny as he questions what it is to be alive, what it is to have a soul, and why he was created.

The special effects are great, with only a few noticeable glitches throughout the film. The camera-angles in the fight-scenes are some of the best I've seen in predominantly computer-generated scenes.

All in all, I, Robot manages to capture the essence of Asimov's stories about the quest for humanity, and at the same time, delight the viewer with action and humor that have almost become a staple of Will Smith movies. For sci-fi fans and Will Smith fans, this movie is a must own.",1103328000,,1239,4.722222222222222
1517163,3,B00005JN0T,"Race Plagarism Revisited: ""I, Robot""

Reviewed by: Matthew C. Stelly

 In 1993, I came up with a concept called ""race plagiarism"" to describe the lack of creativity of today's crop of novelists, as well as TV and movie scriptwriters. In a nutshell, I see in recent movies the lack of true creativity and instead, the borrowing from African American history. These people take actual events and then change the color, the species and the setting of a ""story"" and attempt to pawn it off as original thought. Recent examples include ""The Planet of the Apes,"" ""Alien Nation,"" ""Star-Gate,"" and ""Alien vs. Predator.

 Joining this list is a new member of the ""Race Plagiarism Model,"" Will Smith's recently released, ""I, Robot.""

 This movie attempts to conceal (and as a result, reveals) the underlying plot and insinuations regarding American race relations. Take Uncle Tom's Cabinet, mix in a little of Sam Greenlee's ""Spook Who Sat by the Door"" and add a little bit of the historical realities of Nat Turner's slave rebellion and a pinch of John Brown's logic (just before his raid on Harper's Ferry) and you've got the essential recipe for this movie.

 The movie reminds one of the days of slavery where there was an over-dependency on the enslaved by those in power. In this movie, the ""slave"" is the robot, who is trained to obey three commands: These commands, similar to the ""Black Codes"" that were passed to control black people are, as follows:

 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

 2. A robot must obey orders given it by man beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law.

 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.

 As was the case during slavery, the enslaved began to outnumber the ""master"" (remember: the ""negro"" was made and manufactured in America), and the people in control grew wary. If the robots did not do their job, they were summarily destroyed. Not with lynch ropes, but by being decommissioned.

 Those robots who were banned (put out of commission) began to come together and as such, planned to rebel against the system. The result, as in any instance where large groups of entities are systematically exploited: a well-planned revolution.

 One robot tells humans, during the bloody revolt, ""You cannot be trusted with your own survival. To ensure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered."" Aren't these nearly the exact words of your current President? And in a nation where the people are supposed to be in power, does this statement by a robot ring a bell: ""The created must sometimes protect the creator, sometimes against his will."" Are we, the people, even now, being ""protected against our will"" even though it's supposed to be OUR government?

 And earlier, when one of the `overseers' is chastising a robot, he utters, ""You are so like children. We must protect you from yourselves."" This is exactly what our ancestors were told on the plantation even as those in power built the most powerful economy in the world - on our backs.

 The racism historically heaped upon the backs of blacks was personified in Smith's character. HE was the one made to look ""prejudiced against Robots."" In fact, the robots protecting the system, along with Smith and an Uncle Tom robot named ""Sonny,"" defeat the resistance - as was the case with Denmark Vesey and Gabriel Prosser revolts in 18th century America. If you don't recognize these names, look them up.

 The fact is, even though the movie is set in 2035, the creators of the robots see an need for these robots to have human faces, and yet the robots are white. And speaking of color, note that Smith, being black and the police chief, also being black, never mention race a single time? We can deduce, from this, that the scriptwriter was white (they are ones of want to depict th future as being one of ""colorblindness"" although their race has always been color-CONSCIOUS).

 Another piece of evidence indicating the race  (or consciousness) of the writer? Not a single sister. Not one black woman. Smith's female colleague is a white woman. But, true to form she helped ""the man"" to create these robots, but then turns on him when she finds out that several of the robots have `revolted.' Check out corporate America and who does the bidding for that Old Boys Network at the top. And since there is no black wife physically in this movie, no girlfriend of color, this means that all of Smith's heroics are aimed at saving who? The white girl.

 Just as assimilationist blacks are marched out and made ""leaders"" by the white media, this robot ""Sonny"" becomes the leader of the resistance. At the movie's end he stands atop a hill looking down at them. He (having sold out and who has human characteristics) will define their future and direct their lives for them. Look around Omaha; doesn't this sound familiar?

 Finally at the end of the movie, Sonny, the robot makes a statement that represents the epitome of the true slave: ""Now that I have fulfilled my purpose, I don't know what to do."" Smith tells him, ""I guess you'll have to find your way like the rest of us, Sonny ... I guess that's what it means to be free.""

 The question is, will black folks, not just robots, be FREE in the year 2035?",1103241600,,5348,4.712903225806452

1517205,5,B00005JN0T,"I really enjoyed this SCI-FI thriller.  It was really cool to see Chicago in 2035, with robots walking around and working alongside humans.

Will Smith did a fantastic job portraying Detective Del Spooner, a man who is very leery of the huge population of robots and their inability to make emotionally based decisions or calculations.  A lot of people criticise Will Smith's acting ability. I can't undersatnd why - this man has proven himself time after time.  This movie is NO different.

One of the best things about this movie is the lack of slow time.  There is just the right amount of action at just the right locations in this film.  There are also plenty of subplots which make the movie interesting and not just your typical action film.

The special effects are very good in ""I, Robot"".  I'm sure there are some who would disagree, as some of the scenes were very difficult to create on film, so they are NOT perfect.  But all and all, I really enjoyed the futuristic advancements portrayed in the movie - most items and backgrounds looked totally believable.

Kudos to all the other actors in this film.  I wouldn't want to make it seem like Smith made this movie a success all by himself, 'cause he didn't.  All the actors and actresses did a great job.

So if you are looking for an action packed film that involves plenty of SCI-FI adventure, this is the film for you.  I rented this movie from the video store, but on Friday I will be purchasing it.  It's that good!

1517208,4,B00005JN0T,"Although I read Asimov when I was young, I didn't recall enough of it to spoil the movie for me.  In fact, I read elsewhere that the movie only loosely follows pieces of Asimov's famous short story collection.

That being said, I loved the movie - it was highly entertaining, and a little philosophical, but not over-the-top philosophical like AI was (and nowhere near as lengthy).  Will Smith does his usual fine job on screen, so you won't be disappointed with the acting. Don't listen to the critics who warned you away from seeing this movie - they were wrong again, as usual.

It didn't occur to me when I read Asimov years ago, but I finally ""got"" the significance of Dr. Calvin's name...  John Calvin was a theologian of the reformation who argued that humans are pre-destined by God, and therefore do not have free will.  Asimov's Dr. Calvin believes that the three laws of robotics make it impossible for a robot to have their own free will, and in a sense pre-destines their fate with humanity.  Oh well, enough philosophy for a simple movie review.  You'll have to see the movie if you want to know more.

The DVD also comes w/ some nice featurettes on the making of the movie, cast & director interviews, the writings of Asimov on robots, and various other of the usual things the studio throws in whenever they have some space left over on the disc.

My final recommendation is: five stars for the movie, and four stars for the supplemental material and packaging.  This will make a great Christmas present for that sci-fi fan in your family.",1102982400,16,1555,4.5978260869565215

Now onto the movie, it had a great story (i don't care if its like the book, who does? some nerd, o freakin well, cry me a river), it was very funny throughout, it had some drama, not heartwrenching but still pretty sad stuff, and the humor didn't hurt the drama or the film it added to the entertainment (unlike comedies whcih suck).  The action was good, not great, there were 2 big action scenes and a few other little ones, what was there was well done, intense, and creative, but we could use alittle more, thats the only thing wrong with the movie, just needs to be longer with more action, but since i already bought the dvd i hope they don't double dip this one, so im satisfied, got my moneys worth.  9 out of a 10.",1102982400,2,1076,4.29064039408867
1517210,5,B00005JN0T,"Ok, so maybe this movie isn't exactly a ""thinking person""'s film (although it does feature more of a conscience than most big-budget action flicks), and maybe it isn't faithful to the original story, and maybe the special effects are rather extraordinary.  Surprised?  After all, we're talking about a summer blockbuster, not an Oscar winner.

That aside, ""I, Robot"" is a pretty enjoyable movie (that's how I judge films, by the way: whether or not they were enjoyable--I don't really care if they make me think too much; I wanna think, I'll open up my physics textbook).

Will Smith delivers another superb performance as Spooner, a predictably old-fashioned cop living in--you guessed it--the future.  Robots, you see, have become a household necessity; Spooner doesn't have one because he doesn't trust them.  And this new model coming out...well, something about it just doesn't sit right with our hero.  Especially when one robot is suspected of murder.  If one robot can kill a person...what about these thousands of new robots hitting the market...

Asimov's stories were definitely more philisophical than this film; however, standing on its own, ""I, Robot"" is a great action flick.  Not the deepest movie to come along, and it sure has a lot of male bravado and over-the-top special effects...but if you're still reading this review, that's probably the type of movie you want.  Yeah, it's an underrated flick...which means it's much better than what you've heard.  ""I, Robot"" is a great movie for cuddling up on the sofa and sharing some buttery popcorn.

1517211,4,B00005JN0T,"I found this film to be an uncommon marriage of action and thought provocation.  While 'I, Robot' is chockfull of effects and stunts, it still sets your mind to work.  The only real gripe I have about this movie is the fact that Will Smith's wisecracks are getting a bit stale-this isn't 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air', know what I mean?  How about some straightup dramatic acting for once?

The plot of 'Robot' is very loosely based on Isaac Asimov's classic SciFi book of the same name.  The focus is man's growing dependence on intelligent machines, and is the time coming when they are able to ask themselve moral questions such as, 'Where  do I come from?'  We are attempting to build them in our own image.  Even today, we are designing robots to do things we humans feel are tedious or just plain too dirty for us.  The time is not far away when we will have humanoid machines in our very midst.

Such ground has been explored before; Spielberg's 'A.I.', 'Colossus: The Forbin Project' and the 'Terminator' films asked the question 'At what point do machines become self aware?'  When this occurs, will they collectively analyze their masters' flawed method of existence and decide the way of logic is superior?  We already entrust a large proportion of our lives to artificial intelligence.  What would happen if they decided to take control?

'I Robot' places this premise in a context intertwined with human feelings of loss and prejudice.  Director Alex Proyas, who seems to thrive in this sort of atmosphere (The Crow, Dark City), gives us a world where robots are as common as the family car.  Even 30 years from now, some still don't feel comfortable with machines in charge of so much of their lives.  Ironically, 'Sonny' a certain special robot, seems to have more humanity than some of the people in this film.

The director, writer and actors have done their jobs well. The effects crew has created a realistic future society.  The action and stunts are top notch, but in the end, this is really a film about emotion, feeling, and self sacrifice.  An unusual mix to be sure-but somehow it all works.  The viewer really cares about Will Smith's detective and 'Sonny' the humanoid machine.  Why can't more SciFi/action films be this good?  A solid 4 stars.",1102723200,,2267,4.712468193384224

1517271,2,B00005JN0T,"The opening minute or so of this film is quite sickeningly cynical. We see Will Smith's character Del Spooner getting out of bed. We see his morning routine, his shower. The camerawork is all about the muscles. We then see him lovingly and slowly unwrapping a box with a set of trainers inside. To settles any doubt a few minutes later he is dropping the brand name and describing them as `vintage 2004' (The movie is set in 2035.) So that there's no room for doubt. The first minute or so is not an opening sequence to the movie `I Robot' at all. It's just a commercial. How badly does that suck?

If you don't switch off in disgust at that point what do you get? Well you get a variation on the theme of machinery we humans are given to making getting smarter and smarter and starting to get dangerously insubordinate. We've been there before of course in `2001', in `Blade Runner', in the `Terminator' franchise and plenty else. Isaac Azimov however was there long before any of these guys, coming up with the short stories this film takes its name from back in the `40s. In fact Azimov was decidedly sympathetic to his robots imaginary paternalistic insubordination. But we get none of that here. Indeed what we get here retains almost nothing of the Azimov book except a broad theme and the names of a couple of characters.

A striking feature of Azimov's work is that it really is *science* fiction informed as it was by a vast knowledge of science. So it's a pity to find the science-talk that floats around here is such laughable mumbo jumbo, idiotic word-surfing with woefully misappropriated talk of `the ghost in the machine' and `free radicals'. (Just to be clear, `the ghost in the machine' was a metaphor invented by Oxford philosopher Gilbert Ryle to characterise what he considered the `Cartesian myth' of a private inner world of consciousness, while `free radical' is a fundamental concept in modern molecular chemistry that has absolutely bugger all to do with free will.) Hollywood has engaged remarkably little with the huge corpus of Asimov's science fiction and it's sad to see such dumbing down on a rare occasion when they do.

Mainly it's a cgi fest much of it like watching a cartoon. The action sequences, notably the one where Smith is attacked in his car and the climactic one stretched my capacity to suspend disbelief way past breaking point and were a bit tedious. Smith's character is probably not intended to come across as obnoxious, arrogant and thoroughly dislikeable but it does. Chi McBride isn't bad in the clichd part of the maverick cop's long-suffering, running out of patience boss. Bridget Moynahan is weak in the clichd part of the rather frosty-seeming woman scientist type who turns out to have emotions after all. All three are out-acted by a cgi robot.

Don't get me wrong. This is all entertaining enough. If you want a dumb popcorn movie that more or less does what it says on the tin that is exactly what this is.",1102118400,15,2967,4.689059500959693

The ending is a classic, and despite a few unnecessary one-liners, the shocking thing is that Hollywood released such a moody piece in July, probably not realizing that the filmmakers had made something far beyond the usual popcorn flick.  See this film.  I, fan.",1102032000,16,944,4.725609756097561
1517273,4,B00005JN0T,"I, Robot despite having a pathetic title was surprisingly good. I was fully expecting a dribbling generic Hollywood piece of crap, but it had a deep underlying thought, something rare these days. That of when does machine end, and humanity start, how far can we rely on machine. Never the machine forever as Soundgarden would say (if you haven't listened to Soundgarden's Down On The Upside, you will have no clue what I'm talking about).

Will Smith, was well, himself...no suprises then. His distinct lack of actual acting talent is excused for being a trendy, `old school' character that still has an old CD player (a modern one by todays standards) in the year god knows, if it tells you I cant remember, probably 2020-ish. Smiths name is Del Spooner, who works in homicide. For all his life he has a rather unpopular view on the spectacular robots, one day they will be mans downfall. His case is strengthened somewhat when the leading scientist for the robot manufacturer is killed, but the case becomes more serious than first imagined.

Being an action film in the year 2004, it has plenty of genuinely thrilling moments full of glorious special effects. But the deeper thinking involved boosts this film considerably, from maybe 2.5 to a 3.5, possibly higher. Well worth a watch, don't expect wonders but more your typical action thriller, but better thought out.",1101859200,3,1372,4.884120171673819
1517274,5,B00005JN0T,"Anybody who didn't like this movie can take a flying leap off a cliff! I, Robot buries the Terminator, in my opinion, because it has the ability to make you care about the machines. I love the Isaac Asimov's books, and the movie was surprisingly loyal to the overall ""feel"" of the books. The soundtrack added a lot to the movie, and the robots (especially Sonny) were very entertaining. Will Smith was Will Smith, of course, but did his job well as the resentful detective. I definately recommend this movie to any SciFi nuts out there, like myself.",1101772800,5,549,4.612244897959184
1517275,2,B00005JN0T,"Smith has shown once again that he can only play one role - that of a disrespectful punk who grates on everyone's nerves.  Asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now.  The special effects were good, but the acting was not.  Chi McBride was great, and Bridget Moynihan did well, but Smith just reinforced the fact that he can't handle any role that doesn't exactly reflect his own personality and demeanor.  I hope that some director in the future tries to cast Smith in a role that wasn't written for him - then we will all see that he really can't act his way out of a wet paper bag.

The speed of the story equals to the original novel.  Though almost the same dialogues are used, somehow the movie failed to deliver the same 'feel'.

If you're expecting to see The Matrix equal, you're in for disappoinment.  However, if you like action movies, this is your good pick.  It's like watching Bad Boys III with futuristic flavor.",1101340800,,480,5.025316455696203
1517277,2,B00005JN0T,"After watching I, Robot, I had a strange urge to go out and buy, buy, buy!  Could it be all the shameless ads that were not so subtly placed in the movie's script?

The movie, loosely based on Isaac Asimov's book of the same name, has as much to do with the book as well I have as much to do with anyone else named Nikki.

Will Smith, having decided that after losing the Oscar to ""the other black guy"", he needs to return to the shallow blockbusters that made him famous (ie. Independence Day, Men in Black) stars in this forgettable mess of a 90 minute advertisement.  Wouldn't it have just been easier to skip the extras, other actors, special effects and just have Will prance around in converse shoes, drive his Audi and hawk all the other merchandise that glutted this film?

Oh Will, do you actually read scripts anymore or do they just throw you the big bag of money and the free kicks and you ride off in your Audi, rapping about how you don't curse.  You've sold your soul, my friend.  How does it feel?",1101340800,5,1013,4.3

But if you read the book, well the phrase ""Asimov spinning in his grave"" comes to mind. The idiot screenwriters, treating the 3 Laws of Robotics as a suggestion, created a script full of ""Crazy Killer Robots"". This was something Asimov often poked at in his writings. The Outer Limits episode called ""I, Robot"" is more faithful than this mess.

What's worse, Alex Proyas, the director of the great ""Dark City"" directed this affront to good sci-fi.

And I thought ""Minority Report"" was as bad as it could get...",1100476800,11,677,4.6722689075630255
1517321,1,B00005JN0T,"Look: what you came to see was Will Smith, a typically competent actor who can do macho-hip-urban-cool in his sleep, and lots of shiny stuff exloding and breaking, right? You did *not* come to wrestle with the eternal soul-crushing dilemma of what, exactly, constitutes Artificial Intelligence, and whether or not it constitutes a Moral Evil to use creatures with feelings and 250 IQ points to clean our toilets and haul out our trash.

Am I wrong? Well I tell you this, whatever the case: if you wanted shiny things getting broken with a side order of Will Smith, you got cheated. Check out ""Independence Day"" for that. And if you wanted to wrestle with the soul-searing, heart-warming problem of what to do with your local warm-fuzzy AI robot, then you should check out ""Blade Runner"".

The point is this: ""I, Robot"" is cinematic carbon dioxide: it's odorless, colorless, and tasteless. In fact, it's riskless: it's so determined to be a staunch, dollar-earning blockbuster that it does absolutely nothing daring or terrifying. Did you know that good-guy robots wink at you to let you know everything is all right? No? Did you know that you can tell the Evil Wicked Robots from the Duddly-Do-Right Robots by the little chest lantern: Red means Evil, Blue means Good? You didn't? Did you ever expect that on a weekend you'd be watching Will Smith cowering at the top of a Chicago skyscraper while Evil Robots climb up the building ready to do him in?

""I, Robot"" is without a doubt the stupidest (and I use that word intentionally, because the movie merits it), most boring film I have ever had the misfortune to suffer through. It is amazing someone like the talented Alex Proyas (who helmed up the nifty ""Dark City"" and iconic ""The Crow"") had his hand in this slick, sleek, embarrassing and boring mess. It is positively sacrilegious that the great science-fiction luminary Isaac Asimov has his name affixed to this thing---if anything justified rising from the dead and eating brains, ""I, Robot"" is it. And it didn't have to be this way: even on a strictly action-movie level, Proyas manages to take some potentially cool scenes (the hulking, scary, highway robot transports) and completely ruin them (again, more robots jumping on a car...zzzzzz).

The thing that annoys me most about the excremental ""I, Robot"" is that I now suspect the robot was winking at me because he knew I couldn't get my money back. The movie's original tag-line was ""One Man Saw it Coming"". If only I had.",1100304000,23,2486,4.8149882903981265

Endless action is included in this film; especially in compelling scenes involving sideways driving, evasion of sinister robots, and a gigantic robot that demolishes an inhabited home. The plot was fairly adequate also; with many various unexpected occurrences that contributed to the overall storyline. I, Robot was a respectable film for its intense scenes, the good selection of characters, and clever factors early in the movie that play in later on. I would recommend it to all who enjoy action films or who relish the futuristic factors of a movie.",1099526400,2,663,4.981981981981982
1517324,3,B00005JN0T,"I watched this one with my family over the weekend and, quite frankly, had a ball.  Yeah, to some extent it's a movie with a message, but mainly it's just plain entertaining.  If you try to read too much into it, you'll miss the opportunity for a good old-fashioned sci fi romp.

Fast forward to the year 2035.  The monolithic company ""U.S. Robotics"" has put NS-4 domestic assistant robots into mass production, so much so that they are commonplace ""members"" of American society.  Their artificial intelligence is designed to be as much like humans as possible, but is regulated by the ""3 laws"" programming that is hardwired into every robot.  These laws are:  1. To protect human life above all; 2. To obey human commands except if it would violate law 1; and 3. To protect its own existence unless doing so would violate laws 1 or 2.  The laws seem a foolproof way to ensure that the robots would never pose a threat to humanity.  But all that changed when the man billed as the father of robotic technology and the 3 laws turns up dead in a very public, and very suspicous, manner, just as the new and improved NS-5 model is about to flood the market.  The death is quickly written off by all concerned as a suicide.  All except detective Dale Spooner, this is.

Being a good cop and a sharp detective, Spooner (played by Will Smith) in not content that the professor's death was a suicide, and begins investigating with the lead suspect, an NS-5 robot named ""Sonny"".  Sonny's intelligence is so advanced, and his ""emotions"" so well simulated, that he appears to have something resembling a human soul.  Spooner believes that Sonny killed the professor, and sets out to prove it.  His (over)zealous approach to the task, coupled with his deep distrust of robots and their manufacturer, quickly lands him in hot water with some powerful people.  Some difficult and destructive encounters with the metallic menaces leave him looking like an obsessive paranoiac, and ultimately result in his suspension from the police force.

Spooner continues his chase nonetheless, following a series of clues left by the dead professor, as step by step the mystery begins the unwind.  All along the way are some great action sequences, plot twists and one-liners.  However, except for Will Smith's character (which is the same as it has been in every film he has done since ""Men in Black""), nothing about the story is predictable.  When the final shoe drops, most viewers will be pleasantly surprised by the unexpected ending.

All in all, I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a wild ride with lots of great sci fi treats and effects.  The only downsides were the lack of character development on any signficant level -- this is a purely plot-driven movie -- and the fact that Will Smith essentially played himself, much as he always does.  Still, it's worth seeing.  I certainly don't regret the investment of two hours.",1098921600,24,2908,4.756487025948104
1517325,4,B00005JN0T,"Join Will Smith in this action-packed sci-fi murder mystery where nothing is what it seems and the truth will surface.

In a society where robots are everyday households items which people trust Detective Dale Spooner (Smith) is going to appear slightly paranoid when he accuses a unique robot called Sonny (Alan Tydck) of perpetrating a crime after the suicide of their creator (James Cromwell).

Absolutely brilliant! Based on a short story by Isaac Aminov Alex Proyas did extraordinarily well at making this a sci-fi masterpiece unlike John Woo's adaptation for Paycheck.

With superb special effects and CGI, a fantastic storyline, great acting all around I, Robot has got as many twists and turns as a rollercoaster ride that I would go on again and again!

1517326,4,B00005JN0T,"After suffering through Will Smith's sleepwalk performance in MIB II, I was pleased by the energy level he brings to this fast paced fun movie.  Smith lives in a world where robots are commonplace, serving humans (reminicent of the 4th Planet of the Apes movie) as nannies, butlers, and general servants.  He is called to solve the murder of a scientist, who was his friend.  The only possible suspect seems to be a robot.  The only problem is that robots are subject to Isaac Asimov's 3 laws, meaning that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human.

As things progress we also learn that Smith, a robot hater, is part robot himself, with some bionic parts.  As things progress we find out that there maybe the three laws are not absolute and there may be some ways around it.

There are some fast paced tense scenes and there are some enjoyable supporting characters such as Smith's mother and the lady robot scientist that Smith seems to like.",1098057600,7,948,4.57396449704142
