5111748,5,B007VYEDHO,"If you're tired of formulaic fare - both at the multiplex and in the horror movie scene - this film is a breath of fresh air.  Had the pleasure of seeing this at a festival last year and it's one of the best indie movies I've seen in a long while.  The clever storyline seems to be a psycho thriller about a misfit's revenge then shifts into a tale about said misfit trying to find love and happiness before giving way to a third act that throws all manner of curveballs at the viewer.  Great performance from Kevin Corrigan in a rare lead role plus fun supporting performances from Barry Bostwick and Karen Black, both of whom steal scenes with a veteran's skill.  It's also directed with an eye for color and deadpan dark wit by Jack Perez, who also helmed the underrated LA CUCARACHA.  This is a cult movie in the making - and fans of that sort of fare are advised to take a gamble on this deserving effort.",1336003200,36,910,4.298245614035087

5111770,5,B007VYEDHO,Great Film.  Kevin Corrigan is great in this role.  Plot and twists written as though it was to entertain before the advent of television but brought to the present with brutality.  Great job on this film. I enjoyed it.

5111790,5,B007VYEDHO,"I must admit -- I purchased the movie based solely on the title.  Thinking it would it be of the slapstick horror parody, imagine my glad surprise when upon viewing I found the many layers of this well-thought-out plot.  A person who was recently released from hospital attempting to reclaim some vestiges of a normal life; then finding out that he has a child; also finding someone who actually likes him for what he is.  These are good and unexpected twists.

Other reviewers have covered in detail all the other twists and curves in this movie [and there's more of them than Lombard Street].

All in all, a very appealing movie.  Horror without a lot of horror, romance without a lot of romance, and a bit of humor thrown in for flavoring.  A movie for most of the family [younger children might get bored at the slow beginning pace]",1387497600,4,836,4.570469798657718

5111793,5,B007VYEDHO,"I was really surprised at the quality of this movie. The gore and blood is not the centerpiece like you would find in slasher movies. This movie has a beautiful socially-redeeming plot. Real humans expressing honorable inter-personal emotions, made difficult by the requirements of the plot. The acting is superb; all actors did a great job with their roles.  Characters are believable and genuine. The most interesting character was played by Ariel Gade as Amy Wheeler, the central character's 11-year-old estranged daughter. Her bubbly and lovable personality add life to the scenes with her depressive father Kevin, played by Ken Boyd. In fact, there is so much going on in the interactions between the characters that the few scenes where there is blood seem insignificant. I am so glad that these gory scenes are very short. This movie should have been titled and marketed as a drama--crime thriller. The violent front cover of the DVD case does it a great disservice. If you can ignore the blood, you will be able to enjoy this beautiful movie, and you will experience a whole range of emotions for the characters. See it.",1378598400,3,1128,4.936842105263158

5111795,5,B007VYEDHO,"A funny/sad/scary romantic comedy. Really! With appealing characters you'll care about, warts and all. Cleverly set up to look like a 50s B horror movie, it's actually a whole lot more.

Kevin Corrigan, as Ken Boyd, and Ariel Gabe, as the newfound daughter who brings him out of his shell, have a chemistry that's terrific and forms the heart of the show. Barry Bostwick as the sheriff, Karen Black as Ken's mother, and Lucy Davis as Ken's new romantic interest are great fun, but add complexity and warmth to their roles as well. The murders are cleverly handled.

5111835,5,B007VYEDHO,"Ken Boyd (Kevin Corrigan- `The Departed')has the sort of life only a deranged masochist would be jealous of. He lives with his far from doting mother after being released from a mental institution or `looney bin' as he calls it. His best mate has managed to get him a job at an ice cream parlour where the boss takes great pleasure out of making him feel small. He finds it hard to sleep as he is continually haunted by flash backs to the guys that help put him over the edge.

Then he is sent to a private function where one of his prior tormentors is actually celebrating his birthday - Ken has to dress up as ice cream cone, which only adds to the continuing torture.

Then the tormentor turns up dead and enter Sherriff Walt Fuller played by the brilliant Barry Bostwick, he has a career going back to the seventies and played `Brad' in `The Rocky Horror Picture Show', so I will always have a massive soft spot in my heart for him, and needless to say he steals every scene he is in -fan,bloody tastic. He has a trusty sidekick who is more into puns than boring old detective work. We also have a love interest played by Lucy Davis who I also love and she plays it just the right side of English quirky. But just when you think things can't get any more mysterious his eleven year old daughter turns up and sort of gets things moving at a rate of knots. Meanwhile the body count rises. None of the above is a plot spoiler but more a scene setter to entice you to watch this brilliant little film.

Written by Ryan A. Levin who is better known for `Scrubs', this is one of those films that slipped under the radar and really does deserve a lot more attention. It is warm, funny, brilliantly over acted when it needs to be and for splat and gore fans, we even have some of that too, whilst it may not tick all the boxes of cult it does get remarkably close - highly recommended.",1355184000,,1881,4.248603351955308

This film has its moments, and most of those moments involve the deadpan delivery and sarcasm of Karen Black & Barry Bostwick.  Apart from that, yeah, it has a bit of gore, and yeah, it has a bit of suspense, but nothing particularly outstanding and this is not something I would watch over and over and treasure for the rest of my life.  In fact, just the whole setting of the town and the area in which this is filmed is just depressing.  Worth seeing once, but beyond that, nothing to recommend to the world here.  It's just OK.",1342656000,2,690,4.196969696969697
5111845,4,B007VYEDHO,"Although I've always enjoyed Kevin Corrigan (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fringe/dp/B0053O8A46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fringe</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000NGTJTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>, and a whole host of other TV and movie appearances), I've never considered him a leading man. This movie proves he has the chops for it, though.

The film follows Ken Boyd (Corrigan), a wanna-be artist who is fresh out of a mental institution. Now living with his mother (a delightful Karen Black, although her character gets a little annoying near the end of the film), Ken sullenly scoops ice cream at a local diner and tries not to hate his life too much. Accompanied by his well-meaning, self-proclaimed loser friend, Irv (Leo Fitzpatrick), Ken must deal with locals who mock him for his past, as well as a prodigal daughter, Amy, who returns to complicate his life with her precociousness. Meanwhile, some guy who kills people is viciously murdering all of Ken's old enemies.

Amy is played nearly perfectly by the young Ariel Gade, and Corrigan turns in a remarkably subtle performance as the tormented artist who can barely mask his fear of and longing for regular society. Lucy Davis (of the UK The Office) plays a wide-eyed love interest, and Barry Bostwick does an excellent job as the spacey sheriff who is perhaps a little sharper than he seems.

The script and acting are all top-notch, although the flick is obviously low-budget, which is most evident in some of the death scenes. In fact, the only reason I don't give the movie a full five stars is because the climax is clumsily choreographed and edited, making it seem rushed and awkward. Still, for a film that is as low under the radar as this one, you could do a helluva a lot worse, and in the end, it's still a story that's told well and with a surprising amount of humor and heart.",1342656000,,1980,5.401294498381877
5111846,4,B007VYEDHO,"Some Guy Who Kills People is a new dark horror-comedy that has garnered praise from many film critics. I liked it too, but it's not perfect. The body count could have been higher and the horror elements could have been ratcheted up. I am a horror fan first and foremost, after all. Still, this is a very well acted and well plotted film. Barry Bostwick gives the best performance as a cop who doesn't know what the heck is going on when men in his town are being hacked to pieces. Then there is Karen Black as an unsympathetic mother to Kevin Corrigan's character. The twist ending didn't make much sense to me at first, but the more I think about, I guess it is plausible. I'll have to back and watch the movie again to make more sense of it, I guess. So this isn't a perfect movie, but it is an interesting one and worth seeing.",1341964800,,830,4.2594936708860756
5111847,5,B007VYEDHO,"Dark comedies are often hard to pull off, but SOME GUY WHO KILLS PEOPLE does so quite nicely.  Credit to director Jack Perez and the screenwriter, whose name eludes me (sorry) for their innovative approach to a crowded genre.
Kevin Corrigan has a rare leading role as Kenny, a much maligned man who wants revenge on the bullies who humiliated him in high school, resulting in his admission to a mental institution.  Enter young 11-year old Ariel Gade as the daughter he didn't know existed, and who wants to know her dad.  Add to the mix Barry Bostwick as the sardonic Sheriff, Karen Black as Corrigan's acerbic mama, Leo Fitzpatrick as the loyal best friend and Lucy Davis, the perky Brit cutie enamored with Corrigan.
The film has some great comic lines and displays a lot of genuine heart in its troubled relationships.  Corrigan is excellent as the wounded Kenny..we really feel for him.  Gade is a revelation as the little girl, eschewing the usual bratty know-it-all.  Fitzpatrick and Davis are also quite good.  Bostwick and Black give their best performances in years and look like they are having a great time to boot!
SOME GUY is a refreshing departure from stupid teenage slasher and torture flicks, gory but not overdone, and it's not a reboot or remake.  It's a ""horror"" movie with heart!",1341792000,,1301,4.776785714285714
5111848,4,B007VYEDHO,"Karen Black is back as the mother of our slasher killer Kenny Boyd (Kevin Corrigan). Kenny was tormented by a group of men early in the film. After fathering a daughter Amy, now 11 (Ariel Gade) and spending time in the ""looney bin"" he is back in his home town working at the local ice cream parlor. Revenge is being enacted on those who tormented him, all the while his estranged daughter is attempting to establish a relationship. The town sheriff (Barry Bostwick) investigating the murders is dating Kenny's mom. A British woman named Stephanie (Lucy Davis) has designs on Kenny.

The police officers investigating the case come across as the typical Hollywood dumb cops. The sheriff says things like, "" [When I find him I will] tear his skin off and make him wear his own skin.""

Karen Black gets in a few good lines:

Karen: ""Kenny cooked lasagne once.""
Amy: ""Was it good?""
Karen: ""Yes.""
Kenny: ""Really?""
Karen: ""Don't make me lie twice.""

Kenny keeps himself sheltered. His daughter is forcing him out of his comfort zone. The humor is a somewhat subtle. I am tempted to watch it a second time to pick up things I may have missed. If you enjoy quirky slashers, I suggest ""Chop.""

Parental Guide: F-bombs, no sex, no nudity.",1341792000,3,1228,4.640552995391705
5111849,4,B007VYEDHO,"Coming up with an original concept for a slasher film these days is an impossibility. So what can a budding filmmaker with an itch for violent deaths and twist endings do to make his project stand out from the rest of the ""Scream"" clones? Director Jack Perez decided to meld his gore-fest with a tween coming-of-age story. The result is a rather unique indie-flavored little film entitled ""Some Guy Who Kills People.""

Ken Boyd (Kevin Corrigan) is fresh out of a mental institute. He's trying to put his grim past behind him, but the kids who sent him to the loony bin still enjoy tormenting him. Ken's best friend (Leo Fitzpatrick) gets him a job at the local ice cream shop. He soon begins a relationship with an English girl (Lucy Davis) new to town. At the same time, he finds out he has a daughter (Ariel Gade). Things get even more complex when the guys who picked on Ken start turning up brutally murdered.

This movie works on every level. Anyone picked on in school will relate to Ken and his daughter's plight. At the same time, those with an appetite for bloodshed will thoroughly enjoy the graphic kill scenes. The film is a well-balanced mix of heart-on-your-sleeve indie flare and legitimate slasher gore.

Kevin Corrigan portrays Ken Boyd as an emotionally repressed comic book artist who keeps his feelings bottled up inside... supposedly. Karen Black plays Ken's mother, who constantly patronizes him for being withdrawn. Barry Bostwick is perfect as the sheriff of the small town who dates Ken's mother and begins to suspect he's taking his aggressions out on his high school adversaries. All the actors put forth their best efforts and take the material seriously.

From what I could tell all the special effects were practical. Every knife through the skull and severed head took me back to the wonderful days of the classic 1980s maniac killer flicks I stayed up late and watched during summer vacation. It's always nice to see a movie using old-school prosthetics and gore versus the CGI we've become so used to.

Special features for the movie include a ""Making of"" featurette. It also contains the disturbingly amusing short, ""The Fifth,"" which inspired the full-length. Commentary by director Jack Perez and writer / producer Ryan Levin is included. It's all topped off by a trailer for the film.

""Some Guy Who Kills People"" is a challenging and somehow touching slasher film. Its unique take and blending of two genres on the opposite ends of the movie spectrum make for an entertaining experience. This is recommended viewing for gore hounds with a little heart.",1341532800,2,2590,4.84841628959276
5111850,4,B007VYEDHO,"POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS:

As a horror enthusiast, I like to see how scared a movie can make me feel.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Some-Guy-Who-Kills-People/dp/B007VYEDHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Some Guy Who Kills People</a>&nbsp;is not that kind of movie.

I've never appreciated Horror/Comedy movies very much (preferring to keep the genres separate), but Some Guy who Kills People has some of the funniest lines spoken by the quirkiest characters in the Horror/Comedy ouevre I've ever seen.

The filmmakers managed to assemble a near-perfect cast of social retro-misfits in some strange and very Californian alternate '50's universe. The humour is mostly in the asides, such as when Ronald - the goody-two shoes religious boyfriend of the young leading lady's mother - says in a creepy, robotic monotone, ""Lord, please send someone to aid this precious child and steer her down a righteous path Amen."" while leaving the eleven year-old stabbing at some horrible TV dinner to go to a bible study group.

Barry Bostwick as the town sheriff is hilarious in several sight gags where you can't help but laugh. Karen Black is predictably creepy as the 34 year-old protagonist's (Kevin Corrigan) long-suffering mother - and so funny, too.

Somehow all the madness in this weird psycho-cosmos works its way through to a satisfactory end and everything is right again in the world.

No CG effects plus all real-time physical gags and lines make this quite a funny movie.

Not really a horror movie whatsoever but as a comedy Some Guy Who Kills People has some killer moments.

Now, let's give it the proper treatment that it deserves: add some subtitles and bump it up to a Blu-ray version.",1341360000,17,1731,5.385185185185185
5111851,4,B007VYEDHO,"This is another example of how judging a book by its cover or not knowing much about a movie before hand can illustrate you being wrong, but it actually paying off. ""Some Guy Who Kills People"" appears to be an average slasher with an overdose amount of cheese injected into it, but it's actually a dark comedy more than anything. Ken's mom Ruth, portrayed by Karen Black, is overflowing with sarcasm and the town sheriff, Walt Fuller (Barry Bostwick), is a bit of an idiot who does nothing but tell inappropriate jokes. It sounds kind of harsh and cruel, but it's also pretty funny in the same vein as Bobcat Goldthwait's ""World's Greatest Dad"" or ""God Bless America.""

The Amy Wheeler character (Ariel Gade) is your average little girl; never stops talking and is curious about everything. Meanwhile, Ken doesn't say much. It's kind of the beauty in his character. It keeps him mysterious, but it also illustrates how much his past has affected him. Once Ken and Amy have screen time together though, it's like there's instant chemistry. Amy drags answers out of Ken and her enthusiasm brings out the best in him. The characters have a lot more in common than they realize and it's almost as if they need each other to feel complete.

One of the best comedic sequences in the movie is when Brett Miller (Jonathan Fraser) tries to scare off an intruder at the supply store. ""I was in the Green Berets, a**hole,"" he says. ""And the Navy Seals. And...I was in...Gettysburg!"" He fires off a few rounds and curses before saying, ""I think I still have bullets!"" It's just ridiculous and hilarious. With that said, the movie doesn't shy away from heavy violence either. Blood is constantly splattering on car windows or all over the hood of a car while somebody else is decapitated and another victim gets an axe to the skull. ""Some Guy Who Kills People"" never really doesn't feel like a horror movie and yet it so clearly isn't.

Comedy and horror have always been attached in some capacity like Siamese twins who only really come together over the holidays, but ""Some Guy Who Kills People"" brings comedy and horror together in a way that feels unique. It already isn't taking itself too seriously, but the acting is pretty great as is the screenplay. The humor is actually funny and the gore isn't half bad. ""Some Guy Who Kills People"" blends horror and comedy into a pretty outstanding little movie that is one of the most uncommon features of the year.

Special features include audio commentary with the director and writer/producer, the short film ""The Fifth"" which inspired the movie, a ""Making of"" featurette, and the official trailer. ""The Fifth"" is pretty great. It's about a group of guys just wanting to play poker when Ken brings a little too much work to the poker table. The ""Making of"" featurette is really cool, too. All of the special effects are practical and you get to see how they pulled off a lot of the death scenes. Plus the movie was made in only 16 days, which only makes it more impressive.

""Some Guy Who Kills People"" will be available on DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment starting tomorrow, July 3rd. It's rated R for strong, bloody violence and language, has an anamorphic widescreen presentation with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, with Dolby Surround 5.1 sound, and is approximately 97 minutes long.",1341187200,4,3318,4.723661485319516
5111852,5,B007VYEDHO,"From beginning to end you feel very sorry for Ken Boyd. He has only a small support system to begin with, and his boss continually humiliates him with complete disregard for who might be overhearing. From forcing him to dress up as a mascot at one of his former tormentor's birthday celebrations to wearing the same costume on the pavement out front in order to pass out flyers. That would be an exercise in restraint for any human being to endure, let alone a man with Kenny's questionable stability. The few who truly seem to understand him choose to bypass the warning signs, leading to a gory caper of hilarious proportions. Sheriff Walt Fuller (Barry Bostwick) and Ernie (Eric Price)  make a hilarious comedic team as  the law enforcement in this Mayberry-esque town (Since their reinforcements consist of two additional men who can barely read police caution tape). As is typical in small towns, nobody seems to notice or care. Which allows our anti-hero, I'd have to call him, to get away with it for so long. When Kenny's daughter, Amy, comes round wanting to get to know him, nobody is more excited by this than his mother. It's almost as if the universe is giving her a second chance to correct any mistakes she made the first time around. Rather than give you a complete play-by-play, I should stop here. Though before I do, I should point out that I've rarely seen an actor have as much fun playing a character as I noticed Barry Bostwick did playing the sheriff. Not only did he have some of the most memorable lines, but he just lit up every scene he was in. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who appreciated quality work. Not every film has to be a blockbuster to be well worth the wait.",1340496000,3,1712,4.5732899022801305
5111853,5,B007VYEDHO,"Some Guy Who Kills People is a surprisingly satisfying indie with a full house of on point performances.  This is an amazing gem of a film that didn't have a large theatrical release but it should have!  It's pitch perfect in every way and having seen it on VOD recently it gets better with repeat viewings.  The script is tight, focused on: scares, heart and humor.  The directing and acting all work to back up the script and in many ways elevates the material to grin inducing pleasure.  I cannot recommend the film enough.  Buy two copies and give one to a friend ;)",1340409600,4,570,4.4326923076923075
5111854,5,B007VYEDHO,"Some Guy Who Kills People may actually be quite the clever title, as that's just the way people view Ken (Kevin Corrigan, at his absolute best), the story's ""Protagonist"", a sad, oblivious, and lonely waiter at the local ice cream shop, who also just happens to have been released from a psychiatric hospital. Living with his Mother and without any sense of direction, Ken's world is thrown even more off kilter when his daughter returns. The two bond at first, but Ken has a secret, a secret that may be killing a lot of people Ken doesn't like...

 I don't want to say anything else, because this picture really is story and character driven, and every twist, every turn, they're all part of the fun. I can't recommend this enough for someone looking for a new horror comedy release, it's truly one of those rare gems that offers up blood, guts, and the heart to keep it all together.

5111856,5,B007VYEDHO,"This great low-ish budget flick made the film festival rounds and gobbled up awards throughout 2011. And deservedly so.

SOME GUY WHO KILLS PEOPLE is directed by Jack Perez, written by Ryan Levin, and stars Kevin Corrigan, Barry Bostwick, Karen Black, Leo Fitzpatrick, and Lucy Davis. The gist of it is that Corrigan's Ken Boyd is fresh out of the nuthouse after enduring a brutal attack by a bunch of neighborhood toughs. Boyd's got a bit of a pent-up anger problem and suddenly the guys who tormented him start dying in increasingly-unfortunate ways.

The cast is awesome. Corrigan gets a chance to do some serious acting here as troubled Boyd, Bostwick is hilarious as the Matlock-ish sheriff trying to solve the case, and Black and Davis are solid as Boyd's grouchy mother and his prospective girlfriend, respectively. I'm not going to get into the meat and potatoes of the plot, but the film is far from a straightforward slasher (although there is copious bloodletting for the gorehounds).

The script is fantastic, deftly balancing multiple subplots, such as Boyd's relationships with his long lost daughter, dismissive mother, and a burgeoning love interest. In between fountains of blood and gales of laughter whenever Bostwick or Black is on the screen, there's a genuinely-touching core of sadness about Boyd that makes for an interesting character exploration.

You owe it to yourself to see this film, even if horror comedies aren't necessarily your thing. There's something for just about everyone here. Great stuff.",1340064000,3,1530,5.132530120481928

5111860,5,B007VYEDHO,"Our hero has penned up anxiety of Titanic proportions and is determined to carve up all those from his bitter past whom ultimately forced upon him a stay at the local sanitarium and a humiliating daily existence in a small town that never forgets.  Next to his expressive mother whom hilariously abhors every move he makes, his mind is his own worst enemy and he sinks into a resentful and destructive mental place until ejected from his undignified reality by some unexpected newcomers to his life, but can love win-over his his antisocial mind and frosty heart?

In my opinion, Some Guy Who Kills People is the darling of 2000s horror.  It seamlessly draws 80s horror sensibilities into the modern era without being self-aware, ridiculous, or predictable.  The characters are original, the physical comedy is practical and hilarious, and the story is as suspenseful and dramatic as it is fun.  I saw it at The Boston Underground Film Festival and found myself wanting to cheer out loud because we can all relate to the self-loathing that comes from eras when our existence seems futile.  Beyond the storyline, the secondary characters push this film to new heights with the oddly inquisitive and self-indulgent sheriff, mother whom says the things our own mother's looks make us feel, and much more!  They insulate the story and make it rich with layers rarely seen nowadays.  5 stars!  Equally a the perfect date film and scream out loud bash for your midnight movie buddies!!",1340064000,,1479,4.907630522088353

5111862,5,B007VYEDHO,"You've got all the elements of a 80's slasher here. Comic geek, bullies, mean mom, quirky sheriff. so that's what I was expecting an average slasher to pass a Saturday afternoon. What I got was so much more! Great writing, great character development and great acting! I'm not big on the trivia of movies/acting so the only person I recognized was Barry Bostwick as the quirky sheriff and he played it brilliantly. I also thought the girl who played Amy was quite good and expect to see her getting more work. At first I wasn't too fond of Ken, the lead character, but as the story went on I got to really like him which I think says great things about both the writing and the guys acting. There is a twist at the end and you kind of know there will be but you just don't know which way it's going to twist. I was happy with the ending though, happy with the whole movie in fact. Only thing I would tell people is don't go into it expecting blood and guts, you're not going to get it. Not sure I'd even label it as horror, more of a thriller and a drama, oh and can't forget the comedy. It all ties together well.

5111864,4,B007VYEDHO,"You can smell the involvement of John Landis in this production very early on. It hits just the right tone of slapstick horror, comedy and family drama.

Ken Boyd (Kevin Corrigan) has been in a hospital for the treatment of his depression and suicidal tendencies. When he gets out, he acquires a little job working in an ice-cream parlour (the advertising of which provides many chuckles). We get flashbacks of bullies at school torturing him. Then, back in the present, the bullies start to get killed with a modicum of gratuitous violence. Throw into the mix his daughter Amy (Ariel Gade - Dark Water), who has just found out where her dad lives, and you've got the recipe for gory death pie topped with tender fatherliness.

This film has many strengths. It is well made and well written. Most of the funny lines go to the Sheriff and Boyd's mum and there are enough to keep you laughing throughout (your sense of humour needs to be on the black side though). The main strength is the acting and relationship of the father and daughter. Corrigan is fantastic as a man coming out of a severe depression into a state where he feels more able to cope with life by the end. Gade is wise beyond her years and the relationship between her and her dad comes across as very real.

If you can stomach a small amount of gore and blood you will be rewarded with a funny and touching experience.",1339718400,,1386,4.51394422310757

5111868,3,B007VYEDHO,"This is a review of the film itself and is an abbreviated version of a much longer review I've done of the film.

Going into Some Guy Who Kills People I didn't know much about the film and going by the trailer, I wasn't expecting much either. This can often work in favour of a film if the film is done well enough. When expectations are low even a mediocre or bad film can seem pretty good. But every once and awhile, a film far surpasses expectations. This film didn't just kill it's own characters, it had me dying with laughter. Don't get fooled by the trailer... you'll only end up a fool yourself.

Fans looking for tons of red stuff might be a little disappointed. While there are a few moments of bloody goodness, this film isn't exactly designed for the gore hounds out there. Sure it's called ""Some Guy Who Kills People"" but the death sequences don't strike me as being the sort of thing that would tickle your sanguinary fancy.

The trailer makes the film appear really low budget. And to be honest, it doesn't look much better when you actually see the film. Sure everything is in focus, the film is generally center framed and it tells the story extremely well, but nothing is going to scream out at you as being overly clever. The cinematography isn't about to blow you away. It's clean and clear but not glossy. This is what you expect your standard low budget film to look like.

Now that I've gotten the negatives out of the way let me start on the positives. First is the story. While it seems extremely simple in concept (standard high school revenge film), Ryan A. Levin has written something that is a little bit above standard fare. With some brilliant dialogue, this film takes what might have turned out to be a boring slasher film and transforms it into a pure piece of entertainment bliss. Combined with the directing of Jack Perez, what we see on screen is far from what I expected from the trailer. The trailer does not do this film justice.

Karen Black plays Ken Boyd's abusive and un-encouraging mother. She isn't in the film as much as I'd like her to be as she not only has some of the best lines in the film but her performance is absolutely fantastic. Karen really outdid herself in this role. A newcomer to the scene, Ariel Gade who plays Ken Boyd's long lost daughter, is a breath of fresh air. Move over Chlo Moret. There may be some new competition in the young genre act. Finally there's Barry Bostwick. What can I say about a man that first caught my eye as Brad Majors in The Rocky Horror Picture Show? How about being my favourite thing about this film? Barry plays the role of the Sheriff. From the trailer you can see that there is humour involved in his part. What you don't see is the fact that because Mr. Bostwick is the sheriff, he's in the film a lot. His character is absolutely off the wall and Mr. Bostwick plays him brilliantly. He is comedy gold with a deadpan serious delivery.

Some Guy Who Kills People is marketing itself to the wrong crowd. This film is comedy gold through and through but seems to be trying to sell itself as a horror comedy. This film should focus on selling the laughs and less on trying to win over the genre crowd. Some Guy Who Kills People is set to become A classic.

The characters are well deffined (something i usualy find quite rare in this type of film) and the story has just the right amount of twists to keep you interested and always guessing but not to many that everything begins blurrs into itself and leaves you confused.
