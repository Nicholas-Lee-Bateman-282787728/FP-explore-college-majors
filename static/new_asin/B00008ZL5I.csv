1876152,1,B00008ZL5I,"This isn't so much a review of the movie as much as the Eclectic DVD transfer of Vampire's Night Orgy (aka Orgy of the Vampires). I like the movie. It's a cool, very atmospheric 70's Spanish origin vampire flick featuring Helga Line, a personal fave.

The problem is the image quality of this Sinema Diable/ Eclectic DVD. It's letterboxed as advertised on the cover, but it's so dark it's actually unwatchable. It seems to become darker as the film progresses as well. The color is also so washed out it's bordering on black and white. A very disappointing experience.",1173484800,5,568,4.737373737373737
1876153,3,B00008ZL5I,"A busload of tourists is stranded after their driver drops dead. They end up in a small village with no cars, no phones, and seemingly no people. A character known as the Major appears and offers our hapless travelers lodging at the only inn in town. Soon, the visitors become tasty snacks for a mysterious countess and her gang of bloodsucking freaks! Will anyone survive? Watch for the first victim, a Chuck Bronson clone with tall hair and a fleece-lined marlboro-man coat! Watch as the countess' giant servant butchers the locals for body parts! As a result, the inn ends up with a menu resembling the one in ""The Undertaker And His Pals""! The little girl in VNO befriends a strange little boy who keeps disappearing. Is he a ghost? I was never quite sure. VNO is a fairly presentable little film along the lines of the (superior) Erica Blanc classic, ""Devil's Nightmare"". As a matter of fact, these two movies would make quite a double feature! I can already feel my saliva glands churning! Enjoy...",1101686400,5,1004,4.7102272727272725
1876154,2,B00008ZL5I,Too slow moving for my taste. And when the horror comes it's really cheesy. Should be called vampire boredom. Zzzzzzz.,1082332800,,118,4.95
7988368,1,B00008ZL5I,"the rating is for the DVD transfer, for the Alpha release, not the movie!
I bought the Alpha one because of the review down in this section, but it's UNWATCHABLE! this must have been written by an Alpha employee. this DVD's image quality is so greas-y / grain-y / pixel-y that you could watch an 8 bit arcade video game or a badly dubbed VHS. the colours (the best of it all though) are washed out and the dark scenes are DARK. furthermore it looks as if the scanned source was 4:3 and they put dark grey bars on bottom and top to fake 16:9 - so it's black bars left and right (4:3) and dark grey bars bottom and top (fake widescreen). there's also a thin white flickering line on top of the top-bar, looking like scanning artefacts just as you have them sometimes at the sides of 1930s/40s films. so, BEWARE of this Alpha release!!! which is utterly sad, since the film is an excellent atmospheric cult-movie with clich-free cannibal vampires.
ps: the sound is so distorted on this Alpha DVD that every ""s"" or ""sh"" or every higher frequency sound effect (sharpening of knives and such) is pure ear-bleeding noise.",1526169600,,1114,4.4926108374384235
7988369,3,B00008ZL5I,"This was a Spanish effort made in 1972 (or 1973 according to IMDB) by Argentinean director Len Klimovsky, and originally entitled to as La orga nocturna de los vampiros. Thus, the English title is almost an exact translation of the Spanish title.

In the plot, a group of people is travelling by bus to a town in mountains. Before reaching their original destination, the bus driver dies from a heart attack and the group drives to a nearer town to spend the night and rest. There they find out people in the town amuse themselves by going to cemetery every night and the whole town seems to be run by an attractive countess (played by Helga Lin). The passengers are invited to spend whatever time is necessary in their town as guests. Simultaneously, the bus and the car of an additional solitary traveler (played by Jack Taylor) got suddenly broken. Then, you should figure out some of the subsequent events.

The plot is actually not bad, with a few gory scenes to keep the kitchen of the main tavern running, and subsequent cannibalism. As implied by the cover, you have some nudity and implied sex. The title is deceiving as you will not get close to an orgy. A plus in this film, it was filmed in a nice old Medieval looking town in the mountains in Spain. However, there are several aspects in the plot that are not taken care or adequately developed. So, from the movie point of view, only if you really wish to check on an European, low cost flick and have not extremely high expectations.

IMPORTANT: this part of the comment may be important. I recently upgraded my Pagan, Pal, region 2 DVD to a Code Red Blu-ray release of this film. My Pagan DVD was simply bad quality, the only nice being the art cover. From the comments of other reviewers here, I learnt that the Alpha DVD release was a good looking release. Hard to believe from Alpha Video, but if correct I suggest you to go with the Alpha DVD and not bothering to upgrade to a BR by Code Red. Such release is very expensive and the picture quality is not different from what you would find in a medium quality DVD (nowadays standards).",1485907200,,2105,4.490861618798956
7988370,1,B00008ZL5I,"The title has all of the words and none of of the bite. A group of new employees are on a bus headed to their employer's mansion. While in route the bus driver suddenly dies. Rather than place him on the luggage rack, like an real American family would do, they wrap him up and place him in the back of the bus. The crew opts to spend the night in a small village inn before pushing on, a very odd village where everyone disappears at night...and their bus won't restart...and the meat is like nothing they have tasted. Oh yes it is the type of inn where connecting rooms have a hole in the closet.

AS as exciting as a grindhouse or sexplotation film as this sounds, it is not. It makes promises it doesn't deliver. It actually drags as you have to listen to bad dialog from translations.

7988372,4,B00008ZL5I,"Busload of workers get stranded in lost Vampire village after their driver drops dead behind the wheel. Great example of arty Euro-Trash filmmaking circa early 1970s, grindhouse style. Nice location photography, interesting frame composition, outstanding suits and hairstyles and the ultimate sleaze lounge soundtrack imaginable make this an absolute must see. And it's actually pretty creepy too, unnerving as the cast members get picked off one by one by the Vampire hordes commanded by a reclusive and mysterious countess.

You can buy the ALPHA dvd, it's really a nice transfer with good color and clear image. And it's letterboxed so you can enjoy the widescreen experience...Now I know ALPHA leaves a lot to be desired when presenting the Euro-Trash catalog, their Barbara Steele films are unwatchable. So believe me when I say that this is certainly one of their best yet efforts. I have no idea where they came up with their source material for this one, but I'm thankful it's out there for fans of this stuff to enjoy.",1376006400,5,1027,5.041176470588235
7988373,4,B00008ZL5I,"After watching this film last night, I thought I'd look on Amazon and see some complimentary reviews, but I guess not. I know it's not perfect. At times it's slow moving, some of the night scenes are almost too dark to see exactly what's happening and the accompanying music score makes NO sense, but after that I only have great things to say about 'The Vampire's Night Orgy'. In case you looked at the title and wondered, no it's not pornographic in any way. Actually the only nude scene I saw in plain sight lasted around 10 seconds. I have to say that I've NEVER encountered a film with such endless dread! From the first 5 minutes until the very end you will feel depressed and bummed out, but more importantly you'll feel scared. This film definitely accomplishes one of the major goals of horror and that is to scare the viewer. I don't know if it's the camera angels or the exploitation style it was filmed in, but every scene where the vampires swarm is creepy as Hell! In the village, on the bus, in the hotel. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, but because this film is so dark and nothing ""happy"" ever seems to happen, you'll start to wonder if ANYONE is going to survive in this film. Overall, I'd say if you enjoy French, Italian or Spanish horror, you'll probably find this little gem entertaining and frightening. You should also consider that it's usually available for a really cheap price so you can't lose. It is even included in a few horror film box sets, so if you watch the movie from one of these boxes you'll have paid maybe 50 cents to watch it...",1342915200,4,1582,4.421232876712328
7988374,3,B00008ZL5I,"Disclaimer: The version of 'Vampire's Night Orgy' that I saw is included on a single disc, five movie collection titled 'Vampire Collection Volume 2', which is not available on Amazon in the exact format which I own.  I cannot comment on the quality of the item as sold on this product page; my review is only concerned with the entertainment value of the film.

'Vampire's Night Orgy', directed by the incredibly prolific Leon Klimovsky (75 titles in 30 years!), and starring no one I've ever heard of, is, I think, a fairly typical example of cheap European horror films from the early '70's - the plot moves along in a predictable way, even as the characters often do inexplicable things, and there are moments that are almost creepy, followed immediately by developments that leave viewers scratching their heads.  I believe it's rare for these films to get the release format that is going to put them in the best light, and we're probably never going to get 'director's cuts' or even unedited versions - one thing that must plague these releases is that they were chopped and censored even on their initial release, and the integrity of the films have never been restored.  At least those are my guesses, since too often there are elements in these films that are unexplainable any other way.

This particular example of 'Euro-horror' doesn't stand out, but I don't think it's a complete write-off either.  A busload of domestic workers are en route to a new employer when their driver has a heart attack and dies.  Because one of the workers has her young daughter with her, the rest of the workers put the dead man in the back of the bus and tell her he is sleeping.  Although I don't know what else they would do in this situation, the entire episode seems a little bizarre, but anyway...one of the soon-to-be handymen (who has an almost uncanny resemblence to Charles Bronson) takes over the driving responsibilities.  Soon he comes to a crossroad - one way leads to their destination, the other to a town which is much closer.  Logically, since they have a dead man in the back, the elect to go to the closest place and report their problems - and here is where the troubles begin.

It would be impossible to sell this movie to those that don't already enjoy these types of films, but I did like it in a roundabout way.  When the workers pull into town it seems deserted, so they take it upon themselves to hole up for the night in the town's hotel - it isn't until the next evening that they meet any of the town's inhabitants.  The explanation is that every single soul had been at the cemetery, observing a special service.  Yeah, right.  This is a movie titled Vampire's Night Orgy, after all.  The workers eventually find out that the town is run by 'The Countess', who turns out to be the chief vampire - the rest of the citizens are more like sub-vampires who feast on the remains of her dinner...guests.  Of course the viewer learns this well before the workers, who do eventually figure it out, one by one.

Strange quirkiness abounds; our hero first meets our heroine by observing her through a hole between the hotel rooms as she jammies up and gets ready for bed.  Even after they meet, he continues to watch over her, which is creepy not in a vampiric way but in a creep kind of way.  And even though our workers are outnumbered hundreds to one, the entire town goes to extreme lengths to cover up what's really going on - only after nearly all the normal people have been 'had over for dinner' do the last few decide it's in their best interest to leave town.

All in all, there's enough here to recommend it to viewer's who are already predisposed to cheesy seventies horror films from Europe (in this case, Spain).  What's unfortunate is that there doesn't really seem to be a release that's worth spending much money on.  My copy comes from a company called TGG Direct, or also known as The Garr Group.  This transfer is extremely poor, with the lighting and sound almost making the action indecipherable at timees, and surveying other reviews, it sounds doubtful that any of the other editions are any better, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Vampires-Night-Orgy-1973-Remastered-Edition/dp/B0025ZIG86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Vampires Night Orgy (1973) [Remastered Edition</a>].

I wouldn't hold my breath though.  What would really be interesting would be to watch this film with the night scenes visible and the original Spanish language track and subtitles - in other words, to see it how it was meant to be seen, and then compare it to other horror flicks.  Such a copy probably doesn't even exist, and if it did, the cost might be prohibitive.  After all, I bought this single DVD package with five films for around 8 bucks - even if I had more money than I knew what to do with, I probably wouldn't throw away 25 dollars on a restored special edition.  The sad thing is that studios make a thousand copies of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pearl-Harbor-Two-Disc-60th-Anniversary-Commemorative-Edition/dp/B00003CXTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pearl Harbor (Two-Disc 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition)</a>&nbsp;and sell enough to get their money's worth, while Vampire's Night Orgy, even though it's no Citizen Kane, sucks the blood out of a film like Pearl Harbor and spits in its eye.

Don't let the title fool you - there's no orgy going on here, at least in the large group of naked people sense.  Obviously, once you watch it, you can see that the title is supposed to refer to the gluttonous vampires, but even that's a little questionable.  I would thing 'orgy' would mean over the top, but this is a much more sedate story about blood-sucking freaks than I might have assumed.  Oh well, can't have it all.  Besides, Vampire's Night Orgy is a much better title than 'Vampire's have nice table manners', or even 'Twilight'.",1289260800,2,6354,5.024785510009533
7988375,3,B00008ZL5I,"Normally I avoid buying Alpha DVDs because the quality is so variable. I took a chance on Vampires Night Orgy since it was cheap. What a surprise to find that it is actually a decent transfer, a real rarity for Alpha. And, despite the specs listed on Amazon, it is presented in a 2.35 letterboxed aspect ratio. The movie itself is a typically cheesy Euro horror film with a wildly inappropriate background score. But it is lots of fun and Helga Line makes a good vampire.",1289174400,3,471,4.488372093023256
