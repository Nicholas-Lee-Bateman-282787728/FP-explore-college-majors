Flesh and Blood is a must for any one who calls himself a  Hammer fan.  Ted Newson  did a wonderful job  compiling behind the scenes  information from Hammer's beginning to its down fall.  The video does have  some sound problems (background music tends to be a bit over riding of the  narration at times) but don't let that stop you.  Hammer made films with a  certain style and quality that is, unfortuantely,  not found in films of  today.  Flesh and Blood, if you don't have it get it.  You won't be  disappointed.",929836800,8,682,4.354838709677419
2128610,3,B0002W4TV2,"""Anchor Bay"" should be commended for releasing so many good old favorites, like several ""Hammer"" classics. This documentary though, is in all honesty not that good. As an introduction to new fans I'm  sure it's ideal, but older fans have heard the stories a million times  before. -That is, if you can hear anything. Most of the time the music is  mixed too loud, making it almost impossible to catch Cushing- and Lee's  narration. -This ofcourse is a big minus; it was after all Cushing's last  piece of work. There are some nice interviews though, but as always too  short. I recommend it anyway.",928713600,,598,4.701923076923077

8033736,5,B0002W4TV2,"This excellent Documentary about the Hammer film studios plus the films they made
was filmed in 1997 by Heidelberg films written, produced & Directed by Ted newsom
and then was TV broadcast sometime in the late 90's i assume
this Doco only goes for about 99mins if that but still very informative & Detailed
the Documentary starts from the beginnings of Hammer films from the early 50's with Anthony carreras
and then to Hammer's first feature film which i think was the Quatermass experiment a sci-fi movie filmed in the mid 50's
and then came the Horror films in the late 50's with peter cushing & Christopher lee
CURSE OF FRANKENSTIEN, HORROR OF DRACULA, THE MUMMY all filmed about 1957-59
and so many films after that during the 60's that starred both peter cushing & christopher Lee
aswell as other Hammer film actors/actresses
until Hammer's last film in 1975 which was To the Devil a Daughter
when Michael carreras left Hammer to persue other carrer options
but it didn't fully end there
the executive producer that took over Hammer also produced a TV series in the late 70's early 80's
but after the series ended that was it, Hammer studios had ended
which is tragic some other producer could've taken over the company
and made more hammer films for another 8 years maybe, but who knows.

Most of the cast & crew that were involved in making the films from the 60's & 70's are interviewed
i'm not going to name them all, the list is to long
but here's some Directors that are interviewed and Give their recollections on the films they made with Hammer
Freddie francis, Jimmy sangster, Roy ward baker, Val Guest,
Christopher Lee is interviewed for this TV broadcast about his performances in the Dracula films
also Michael carreras is interviewed aswell
plus many other Actress's from the Hammer films are interviewed
except for Ingrid pitt & Yvette stensgared were not interviewed for some reason
Christopher Lee & Peter cushing do the Narration for this Documentary

another company Alpha home ent' did the same thing for British Director Derek pykett
who produced & Directed a 3 hour Documentary about the Amicus films production company from the 70's
this Documentary has been released on DVD now since 2012
called AMICUS HOUSE OF HORRORS which i also have
this Doco is spread of 2 Discs actually about 90mins each Disc
very detailed Documentary about american producers Milton subotsky & Max rosenberg
and how they started Amicus films
Disc 1 is about the beginnings of Amicus films and the films they made during the 60's
one of them is Dr Terrors house of Horrors with peter cushing
lots of interviews with the cast & crew that were involved, the remaining Actors anyway, some have passed away now
Disc 2 begins from 1972 until 1975-1976 when the last Amicus film was made
 Tales from the crypt & Vault of Horror, Asylum and many more are talked about
this Doco was filmed in 2011 so all the interviews are recently filmed
Milton subotsky's wife is interviewed along with many Actors/actress's that starred in some of the Amicus films
the remaining Actors/actress's anyway that are still living cause most of the cast & crew have passed away now
i've written a review about this DVD aswell, check it out and buy this AMICUS Doco aswell still available to buy from amazon

anyway this Hammer Doco is excellent
all in all a very interesting 99mins
this DVD release by Image ent' is in 1:33:1 fullscreen
but somehow Image ent' have formatted this TV broadcast to fit your widescreen TV so there's no black bars actually
but there are no special features unfortunately
5 stars i gave it worth the money.",1419033600,3,3613,4.757575757575758

8033738,4,B0002W4TV2,"The menu on this is a cool guillotine chop start how cool is that?
But then after that nothing,just silence.
This run's 100m.
I rate this good.
Does have a cool trailer.
Interesting and informative interviews with directors,producers,and cast members.
Who better to narrate Hammer,but the pros,Chris Lee and Peter Cushing.
Sadly not too much present footage shown on these two,Peter's health was failing bad guess that's why.
I still recommend this Dvd.",1345852800,,453,5.219178082191781
8033739,3,B0002W4TV2,"I just finished watching this documentary and have to say that it is a must for fans of hammer films. It was interesting to hear about the attitudes (both negative and postive) that the crew had towards these films. Also some of my favorite actors and actresses appear in very rare interviews- i.e. Ingrid Pit, Peter Cushing etc...

The only reason I give this title 3 stars is due to the sound mix. Like all documentaries it cuts from interviews to snippets of the films, during these sections the film score raises to the point that i had trouble hearing the narration or interviewer- this coupled with the fact that there are no subtitles proved to be a little distracting.

All in all, if you are a fan of hammer you still NEED to buy it.",1199491200,6,742,4.448529411764706
8033740,4,B0002W4TV2,I did not know this documentary was available untill I had rented the dvd. After watching this well crafted movie I became even a bigger fan of the Hammer Horror series. A look at inside the studio that created all the classic horror films I watched as a kid and to see Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee on camera talking about these wonderful movies is such a treat. I really enjoyed this dvd. You will too!,1193961600,11,408,4.381578947368421
8033741,4,B0002W4TV2,"The documentary is interesting, of course, but it seems to be sort of a budget production, with archival material that ranges from acceptable to, well,... scans from cheap horror magazines.  More, a lot of it appears to have been transferred from videotape.  Considering that the Hammer movies themselves are so lush, it seems a pity that the definitive Hammer documentary should be so cheap-jack.  And I would have liked to hear about Amicus and the other Hammer offshoots, but I can see how that would be a problem to arrange.  As with many British documentaries, it seems awfully formal at times.  I don't want to make it sound all that bad, though.  There are interesting interviews (many that I'd never seen before), behind-the-scenes home-movies, production footage and other surprises.  In all, it's well worth the price if you are a fan of Hammer, or Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, who happen to be the hosts of the documentary!.",1105660800,14,941,4.917721518987341
