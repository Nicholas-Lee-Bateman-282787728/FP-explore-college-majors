2789420,3,B000O179G8,"Most of the discs played well in both a computer drive or in one of 3 dvd players. However two of the discs would not completely play in any drive. My thanks to Amazon for promptly replacing the defective merchandise.
The movies themselves are of course: John Wayne. Nothing else to be said. The second set seems to be OK",1184976000,5,321,4.366666666666666
2789421,5,B000O179G8,"This is a must-have collection for John Wayne fans.  The movies are some of his best and many come with special features and interviews with actors and actresses that co-starred and worked with ""The Duke.""  Great quality and very entertaining!",1184198400,11,243,5.05
2789422,5,B000O179G8,This collection is an outstanding deal at $70. THis contains many of Wayne's most sought-after films at a bargain price.,1181692800,6,120,5.05
2789423,5,B000O179G8,"Contrary to Amazon's editorial description above, the John Wayne Century Collection contains 14 movies, but does NOT include THE QUIET MAN. Still, it is a good bargain and contains a new Special Edition release of TRUE GRIT.",1179792000,37,224,5.081081081081081
2789444,3,B000O179G8,"This is a great collection of films by one of the greatest actors to ever grace the silver screen.  Too bad he didn't get the recognition that he deserved.  He only won one Oscar and that for his last film, ""The Shootist"".  He really should have received more for such films as ""The High and the Mighty"", ""The Quiet Man"", ""The Cowboys"", and others.  The films themselves are great.  I only gave this collection a 3 due to the poor quality of the DVDs themselves.  The sound was remastered for each of the films but no longer is synchronized with the film.  In most cases, the sound comes before the action.  This is very disconcerting while viewing the film.  If not for this, this collection of John Wayne films would have received a 5.  Too bad more care wasn't taken in remastering the sound.",1266537600,4,795,4.458333333333333
2789445,5,B000O179G8,I got these for my dad this Christmas and he loves them.  I was named Jake after the Big Jake movie so I figured he must like that movie and I realized he did not have it so I got him this set for a great deal on amazon.  I seen the same set for $100 dollars at Barnes and Nobles and I got in on here for less than half of that cost.  Everytime I call home he is watching one of these movies  I might have to get him a Clint Eastwood set next year.,1233187200,2,448,3.5876288659793816
2789446,5,B000O179G8,"Purchased as a gift for a ""dyed in the wool"" John Wayne fan.  He was very pleased with the titles included in this collection.  Purchased because it includes a very good mix of the Duke's better more well known movies.",1228521600,,218,4.425
2789447,5,B000O179G8,"JOHN WAYNE is what all us AMERICANS THINK and would like to be, these films, despick the lives and way we all wish we were.

2789449,5,B000O179G8,"Wonderful & Safe Entertainment For Whole Family

We do not have regular TV as a result of what is being shown today, especially the
commercials we find very to be very offensive and can be worst then the programming in some cases.

We are purchasing more & more of the various DVDs from the time when shows were morally much safer all around! Healthier experience for children of all ages!",1207094400,5,389,4.542857142857143
2789450,5,B000O179G8,"Paramount is generally clueless about handling the classic movies they have in their possession. Just because the movies star John Wayne, I wouldn't expect Paramount to treat them any differently, but this time they actually did a good job. Paramount actually included commentary on five of the films, although why there isn't anything extra on the wonderful ""Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" and there's only a featurette on the epic ""In Harm's Way"", I don't know. The product description does a pretty good job of describing each film, so I'll just list the extra features for each movie:

El Dorado - NO EXTRAS

Even though we're not getting ""The Quiet Man"" in this extensive set, ""McLintock"" almost makes up for it as the dynamic between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara is just as combative with that same underlying chemistry. Think of it as The Quiet Man of the frontier west. Highly recommended.",1204588800,15,3292,5.377431906614786
