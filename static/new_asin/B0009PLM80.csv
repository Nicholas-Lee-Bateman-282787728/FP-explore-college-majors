8064809,1,B0009PLM80,"The Grand Knights have been scattered to the winds. Toga has left the group after causing Leele to retreat into a vegetative state after he reveals her past. Ena is presumed dead after careening into the ocean preceded by a deep fry by a Zeravire energy beam . Luna too has been hospitalized/imprisoned by government forces after the EFA Gran Troopers had to rescue Gravion from being destroyed. Mizuki was revealed last volume to have been a spy, but now is having second thoughts about betraying her ex-teammates. Incredibly, it's Eiji, the obnoxious hothead, who has to track down Toga and begin to regroup his shellshocked friends. Meanwhile, Sandman's evil brother, Hugli, the leader of the Zeravire, appears as a giant hologram all around the world and threatens to destroy the Earth within 48 hours!

I liked the first season of this show and even enjoyed Volume 1 of the second. But starting with Volume 2 of Gravion Zwei, I found the plot almost incomprehensible, especially the backstory. I still don't really understand what happened to Sandman and his brother centuries ago. I know someone very dear to Hugli died and he blamed Sandman for it, but beyond that, I don't get it. Volume 3 attempts to up the emotional ante, but instead the characters become so weepy and sentimental that they become ridiculous. All the episodes since Volume 2 have seemed forced, from Ena's death to Mizuki's betrayal, to Ayaka's disguise as Raven. The writers of the show are saying that they have to have to have big revelatory events because the plot doesn't really have anything going for it, resulting in some pretty lamebrained twists.",1162339200,,1634,4.898916967509026
8064810,3,B0009PLM80,"This is the last of this series and it ends with a bang, as the two rival groups of pilots get it together for the final confrontation.

If you have a favorite character in this series, they all get their moments in these last few episodes, with some secrets revealed at last.  All of the English voice actors did a great job throughout the whole series.  The sly fanservice and digs at the mecha genre were a lot of fun

This DVD earns three stars because the story rushes too much at the end to tie up loose ends, skimping on how these revelations can affect the various characters, perhaps if the story had contained less comedy and more character developement it would had been better and more logical how the story ends",1124150400,3,724,4.421052631578948
