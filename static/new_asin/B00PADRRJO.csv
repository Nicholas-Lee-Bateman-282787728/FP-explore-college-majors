6791527,1,B00PADRRJO,HORRIBLE!,1420934400,,9,9.0
6791528,3,B00PADRRJO,"The zombie flick is a recurring favorite to we Fellow Fans; from Romero's experiment back in '68 to the modern marvel that is The Walking Dead, flesh-eating reanimates have become the most widespread favorite amongst the monsters of our shared nightmare obsession, especially in the last ten years or so.  I've always felt the beauty of the concept of the dead rising to eat the living is that it serves as a perfectly distorted mirror with which to reflect upon the darkness which is human nature.  Starting with Night of the Living Dead, a large slice of the zombie pie has always been engaging we the viewers in some social commentary, be it satirical or serious.  This trend continues even today with that popular aforementioned cable series that some of you may have heard of...

Into this fray comes the indie zombie flick Sick: Survive The Night, directed and co-written by Ryan M. Andrews.

A strange, rampant virus has struck; quickly, it's become a worldwide pandemic.  The infected become mindless, preternaturally strong...and extremely violent, indiscriminately attacking and eating those that are not infected.  As panic begins to grip the planet, the world's governments gather their brightest medical and scientific resources in a desperate bid to find a means to halt and hopefully cure the affliction.  Dr. Leigh Rozetta is one such viral expert, and we're with her as she departs her family home, escorted by military personnel to a secret, secure facility to work on saving the world.  Two years pass, and on the surface the few uninfected people gather themselves into groups; scavenging tribes who forage for food, medicine, ammunition...their enemies both the now overwhelming numbers of the infected...and some opportunists that are not infected, but just as merciless in their methods.  One such group of desperate survivors is seeking supplies when all but two of their number are wiped out...and these two men run across Dr. Rozetta, who has left the military bunker to pay a visit to her home and family; as these two hardened survivalists travel with the scientist to her family home, what secrets will they discover?  Does she hold the answer to the cure, or something more sinister?  Will they survive the night...and each other?

The zombie film, for as much as we all enjoy them (myself certainly included), is moving toward a sad redundancy...let's face it; it's difficult to come up with different ways to deal with the same concept.  While not re-inventing the genre, Sick does offer some innovation; it's story much more character-centric, the zombies becoming so much of a background element as to have very little screen-time, comparably.  Andrews' direction of the tale is very skillful, making the most of a limited budget and shooting schedule, resulting in a movie that looks far more polished with higher production value that it had any right to.  Admittedly, I felt that at times the script tried to work in too many concepts and twists, and a time or two might have tripped over it's own laces a bit, but it was never enough to push me out of the flick.  Much of this is owed to the acting as well as the direction; the ensemble cast each did well with what they had.  Granted, some of the second-tier performances tottered on the brink, but these times were few and far between.  The leads all acquitted themselves very well; Christina Aceto was convincing as Rozetta, showing a range from a strong-willed scientist to a frightened, homesick girl. Jennifer Polansky played the part of a rescued survivor with a haunted past with realism and emotion. Richard Roy Sutton as the dry and distant Seph carried a bit of Owen Wilson in his performance, but still maintained an edgy feel, downright vicious at times.  Robert Nolan was his usual excellence, moving from introspective and level-headed to terrified and emotional with experienced grace.  Finally, genre favorite Debbie Rochon, in a series of cameos as another scientist communicating via webcam, threatens to steal the show.

As far as the subgenre is concerned, you'll not find a lot in Sick story-wise that you haven't seen before, but there is enough of a new angle in the storytelling to make it stand out from the typical indie zombie fare.  The astute direction and acting raise it several notches, and if you're one o' those that loves the ol' gut-munchers, you just might find some good stuff in this one to sink your teeth into. (Yeah, fine...that was bad.)

That's my two cents, folks.

6791529,4,B00PADRRJO,"""Sick: Survive the Night"" is a top shelf indie zombie flick... Its full of original ideas and makes expert use of budget limitations. Ryan M. Andrews and Chris Cull penned a story that centers on character, tension, and dread; keeping the apocalyptic scope and tone alive with a story rather than hordes of extras and loads of bad digital effects. With incredibly strong performances from a very talented cast, careful photography, and disciplined direction, Andrews builds a film that pays just enough homage to sub-genre greats of the past while telling a truly original story.  - VileReviews.com",1420502400,4,598,5.164948453608248

6791552,2,B00PADRRJO,"I'm only going to say this.. Christina Aceto as ""Dr. Leigh Rozetta"" - ask for a bathroom break or do it on freaking screen but BLOW YOUR DAMN NOSE. You were snotting so damn bad a FEW TIMES, that I couldn't even hear anyone talking. my freaking gawd. just blow your f'ing nose. They do allow breaks and it doesn't make it appear ""more authentic"" if you're snotting and constantly sucking it up just to make it appear as you've been crying. Gross. The only reaction I got out of this movie was wanting to b slap your butt and hold you down and make you blow your nose. Take 3 seconds and blow! That alone made the movie unbearable with her in the scene. It's freaking unprofessional to do that while on set. Want to make it in the big time, know when to blow your freaking nose. If it's an allergy, take a damn pill before screen call.

And I'm not going to do the research, but is that your sister in the movie Don't Blink? ...because she does the same exact thing - she does not blow her freaking nose if it were to save her freaking life. What the hell is wrong with you people that you can't take 3 seconds and blow. It does NOT add to the shot. It makes you look as an unconditioned, unprofessional actress - learn how to create a tear up/cry without having it roll out your nose so you don't have snot rolling and then sucking it up - gross, yet again - if you're unsure how to work on this, learn how to play poker and then get into a relationship. Put those two together, wait until he screws up and there you go. Tear up, no snot. You're a female - it should be easy.

*throws hands up in disgust* Yeah, I'm a smart ""a"" and I'd tell this to your face. BLOW YOUR NOSE. <3",1458518400,,1678,4.09726443768997

May be a little more slow-paced than some, because it involves feelings, expressions of grief and PTSD, and portrays people trying to think their way to a solution.  Some of the thinking and symbolism works, some doesn't quite make it.  Still a seriously thoughtful zombie flick.  I'm glad I took the time to see it.

6791575,2,B00PADRRJO,"This movie was all over the place.  It attempted to blend the story of survivors with that of a military group protecting a research facility with little success.  There was exploration of loss, effects of massive trauma/change on survivors and the exploration of relationships in a post-apocalyptic world in a not so clear or substantive manner.  The story jumped from one story line to the next never reconciling them.  There were elements that were interesting, such as the vaccine that potentially could slow the spread of the infection and the cannibals.  Unfortunately, there was this heavy focus on folks too stupid to pay attention during the zombie apocalypse.  And, how did that bottle of wine last so long?",1439683200,3,717,5.033898305084746

The script was decent and there were some good lines throughout the movie along with a few plot twists. A couple of the main actors did a decent job, but the acting overall was pretty bad.

6791583,2,B00PADRRJO,"Overall, I found myself wondering why? What was the story that this film was wanting to tell? Most of the components are redundant aspects found in zombie horror. I did appreciate the added mix of these scavenger crews roaming around raping and pillaging. However the story doesnt give enough time for that element to really take off. Most interesting things take place in flashbacks while the main meat of the tale is left to melodrama and mild zombie attacks. Sick: Survive The Night isn't a film that you will kick yourself if you miss it. Mostly it is just a boring movie where people talk too much.

The special effects, for the most part, keep within practical-low budget grade effects that work. I preferred the stripped down zombies that go back to the beginning of this genre. The creature effects are cool enough, however the zombies don't dominate the film with enough force or energy to really kick Sick: Survive The Night into thrilling gear. The soundtrack and sound effects are decent enough to give the film atmosphere, some moments do feel creepy and chilling, it just never seems consistent through the whole film.",1431216000,,1132,4.835051546391752
6791584,2,B00PADRRJO,"A world wide zombie virus pandemic forces  Dr. Leigh Rozetta ( Christina Aceto, Sister Rosetta Stone already taken) to live in isolation with three other people in a remote location to work on a cure. Recreating the CDC would break the film's budget. There is internal conflict. Why? I don't know.

In a subplot survivors fight infected people. Eventually they meet up and Dr. Leigh takes off her clothes. Very boring. Script has an attempt at clever. One guy named ""Christian"" for example is going ""into the lion's den.""

Don't watch it if you're looking for a lot of action and gore though, it's mostly psychological, a view of life a couple years into a worldwide epidemic. Has some really great plot twists and some interesting characters, even though most of them are very short lived. I would have liked to have seen some plot points elaborated, for example, they mention that there are 'safe zones', and I wondered how that is possible. What made them safe zones? How were they kept safe? Liked that the protagonists were called 'Vultures'. Seemed pretty appropriate, and it was nice to see another set of people with a nickname the way the zombies are called everything except 'zombies' in most films from this genre these days.
