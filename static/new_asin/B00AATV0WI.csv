8549424,3,B00AATV0WI,"Mondo Cane/Monde de Chien/Mundo do Cao/Perro Mundo/Dog's World, this exploitative doco got around.  It was Perro Mundo when I saw it in Mexico City upon its release there.  Like a super nova, it flared brightly then dissolved after the fuss subsided.  What was outrageous at the time is hardly so nowadays.
  Mondo Cane 2 was made only because of the popularity of the first one and is hardly worth the effort.  And avoid Women of the World completely.
  Famous for its theme music Di Piu/Plus/Mais/Mas/More.",1492819200,,508,4.894117647058824

8549426,3,B00AATV0WI,The best movie of the three  is Good Bye Uncle Tom. It is an Italian production about slavery in the U.S. before the Civil War. There is a lot of nudity in the film. It is sometime funny and probably inaccurate as a historical piece.  The other two movies I did not like.,1434153600,,271,4.09433962264151

8549428,2,B00AATV0WI,"I don't know about 'Mondo Cane 2' and 'Women of the World' (neither of which I'd seen before), but the Mondo Cane movie in this set has been expurgated compared to the original Australian cinema release, which I *did* see in the cinema when first released.

This version is not as shocking as the original, so hardly worth buying.  And compared to 'Mondo Cane', 'Mondo Cane 2' and 'Women of the World' are relatively boring.

Edit:
Just to clarify my comments in the light of Robert Knox's comment, please note that I did explicitly state that this was expurgated compared to the original cinema release *in Australia*.  The USA is a very prudish country, and apparently they got this very expurgated version rather than the full 108-minute original seen in enlightened parts of the world.

Try a Google search for ""eating monkey brains"" ""mondo cane"" (with the quotes) and you'll see a number of mentions of this scene from the movie (apparently also repeated in ""Faces of Death"", which I haven't seen) - but it's not in this Amazon version, which is why I returned it.",1381104000,10,1069,4.725806451612903
