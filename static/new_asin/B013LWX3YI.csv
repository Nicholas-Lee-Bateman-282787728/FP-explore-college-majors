Years ago when Gregory Peck was being honored by the Academy, Dean Stockwell, who played the son in Gentlemen's Agreement, said having been in Gentlemen's Agreement was the highest honor of his career.  Seller packaged the DVD perfectly and it arrived in a timely manner.  Would not hesitate to purchase from seller in the future.",1456617600,,389,4.7611940298507465

7368276,4,B013LWX3YI,"The movies are nice, B&W, and, of course, quite dark due to the recopy from old films.  Yet, I enjoyed the stories which are still my kind of movies, even today.  So glad these old movies are reappearing again for sale and are of history of life as it was.",1446940800,3,256,4.1

8728143,5,B013LWX3YI,How Green was my Valley is a beautiful film with an uplifting message. This movie I introduced Roddie McDowell who then carried the rest of the film as the story is told from his poverty. Loved it despite the poor attempts at Welsh accents on the part of a few stars.,1492387200,,267,4.254901960784314
