The second disk covers mysterious and sacred places created by man over the centuries and is really fascinating.  This disk includes Stonehenge, The Great Pyramids, Hagia Sophia, Borobudur, St. Peters Basilica (Cathedral), and the Taj Mahal.  Also, at the end of the disc, you are treated to a bonus selection titled ""Symphony of Wonders"" which will show all different locations with a distinctive and very pleasing musical piece which is different for each location.
When transported to these different places, you will receive the history of the site, how it was created, and all the knowledge that has been gleaned through the ages about these wonders.  The sweeping photograpy and attractive music for each location is just gorgeous and keeps you asking for more as the collection proceeds.  The narration during the programs is quite well done and very informative in how it is delivered and it does not drag on or create boredom to the viewer.
Some bonuses of the DVD include the added program ""Symphony of Wonders"", a map showing all the wonders at the various points of the globe, and a very appealing 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound track that makes the discs so much more enjoyable.  If you like history and landmarks and breathtaking beauty created by man and nature alike, you will find this set very much to your liking and with an excellent price to boot.  Hopefully they will release more sets like this one being that there are so many more wonders in the world to experience.",1025222400,23,2070,4.863636363636363
7945938,4,B00005MKIX,"This is a well done DVD featuring 21 of the world's greatest wonders, both natural and man made. Though the 21 wonders featured in this collection may not all be on everyone's Top 21 list, they are nonetheless all truly outstanding. The photography is first rate, and the narration is both informative and interesting. Not only are you shown pictures of each wonder, but you are given their history and origins, and are shown the various cultures that surround each of these. The musical accompaniment is also nicely done, with the music matching the cultures of the various regions. The bonus feature - Symphony of Wonders - is a nice feature. It is basically a summary of clips from the full DVDs set just to the music, no narration. It's especially good for Americans as it begins and ends with American scenes set to Patriotic music. Overall, a very nice collection well worth the price.",1009843200,16,891,4.754838709677419
