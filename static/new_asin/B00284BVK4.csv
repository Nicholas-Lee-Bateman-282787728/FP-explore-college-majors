8355696,5,B00284BVK4,"I first saw this film in a private screening and had the honor of meeting the filmmakers and some of the actors. Director Paul Awad and screenwriter, Kathryn O'Sullivan make a dynamic team. The acting is very good and very funny!  This little film went the festival route and did well. If you are a fan of the classic horror genre and enjoy a smart parody / thoughtful comedy, you'll find this movie to be a real gem!",1242518400,2,417,4.346153846153846
