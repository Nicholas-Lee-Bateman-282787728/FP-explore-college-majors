5860904,1,B00DW5ILLA,"Story stated out with instant action.  Grabbed interest immediately with intense situation.  Had hoped for a more meaningful story line after the initial intense scene but it deteriorated more rapidly as time went on and end was dumb, left you with nothing important.",1390089600,7,267,5.186046511627907
5860905,5,B00DW5ILLA,"Very inspirational movie, its a must watch.
The kids loved it. The movie is definitely a very family movie and can be watched over and over!",1386720000,,140,4.423076923076923
5860906,4,B00DW5ILLA,"An interesting tale that touches somewhat on the cost of fame on ordinary lives, and how precious life is, for the short period we have it, while also offering up a bit of romance.

There are obviously several analogies to Jesus although not really a Christian film.  The hero, a carpenter, attempts to rescue a drowning boy.  Too late, the child is proclaimed dead at the hospital; however, the simple touch and wish by the carpenter that God would bring him back alive seemingly startles the boy out of death.  The child's single mom pursues a gentle relationship with the man who is now thrown into the world's eye as a miraculous healer.  The town is named Bethany, of course, the place in the Bible where Jesus brought Lazarus back from the grave.

The story is really about relationships and trying to stay normal and annonymous while those around want something else.  The beginning with the drowning, rescue attempt, grieving by the mother are all very realistic and moving.  The romance is a big part of the story as is the push by the media to develop the miracle/healer aspect; there are also side stories about the carpenter's ill mother and the townfolks' reactions.

The actors and setting are fine; the story came across, at times, floundering for direction on what theme it wants to pursue, but it held my interest, and overall, I liked it.  It felt more like a fantasy/fable, especially with the ending, than a religious film, which it isn't.

A clean film, I say PG, but, as stated above, with very serious topics of life, death and grief.",1380758400,24,1557,4.6875

8598575,5,B00DW5ILLA,Great Movie!,1529280000,,12,5.5
8598576,3,B00DW5ILLA,"Slow moving and frustrating at times. Guy has the power to heal but never figures out why. What was the point of this? If to give glory to God, that was not clear in the movie.",1521504000,,176,3.9166666666666665
8598577,1,B00DW5ILLA,"Other than the main star, the acting was terrible. And the story wasn't realistic at all. Guy saves a mother's son from death, and she immediately wants to date him. If that were true, that would be so shallow. I was hopeful for this movie, but it was a complete let down. No depth at all, just lame.",1519344000,,300,4.189655172413793
