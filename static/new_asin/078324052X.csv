7795812,4,078324052X,"There are nine tapes in this collection, and all the films are arguably among Abbott and Costello's best work for Universal.  Among these films is their first appearance in a motion picture - One Night In The Tropics.  They aren't the stars, but they are in it enough to jystify watching the  whole movie.
However, only eight pf these tapes are movies.  The ninth -  Abbott and Costello Meet Jerry Seinfeld - is a pointless  ""tribute"" to the team, which originally aired on NBC Thanksgiving  Day 1994.  It includes a lot of inaccurate comedy material performed by  unknowns supposedly evocative of old burlesque style comedy.  There are  some nice home movie clips of A&C, but not enough, and the clips from  the actual films that are shown are talked over by Seinfeld!  Pretty  pointless if they can't include entire, uninterrupted routines.
The  majority of Abbott and Costello's 36 motion pictures were released by  Unverisal, and all their films but one have been released to home video -  in fact, the majority pf these are available from Amazon.com (thanks,  guys!).  The one that has never been released?  Hey, Universal - where's IT  AIN'T HAY?",952560000,11,1152,4.865284974093265
