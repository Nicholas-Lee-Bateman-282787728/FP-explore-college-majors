8289492,1,B001CU7SGG,The movie doesn't show any footage of the Legion. It only interviews some old ex-legionnaires. Only films of re-enactors. Voice track is way out of sync.,1245974400,6,153,4.923076923076923
8289493,4,B001CU7SGG,It is a pretty well done documentary and gives a good historical perspective of the Legion.  You will not find any footage or information from Vietnam era till present.  It concentrates on the early and middle history of the Legion.,1241308800,4,232,4.775
