8143605,3,B000I2J7TA,Pleasant visuals made more appealing by the fact that they are handmade.  Its nice to put on a big screen on the wall.  My granddaughter liked it.  But this is nothing extraordinary.,1386547200,,182,4.625
8143606,1,B000I2J7TA,"For something like this to work, it must be the highest quality image, full screen, and interesting to look at.  This was just junk.  I work in video, was trained in video arts when I went to art school, and can tell you that this video is without creativity, without imagination, and it is certainly bad art.  If you can find a video called ""By Design"" by a company called Colorcalm,you will see what a collection of great video artists are capable of doing.  This video has a series of gorgeous and subtle video 'chapters', each one like a beautiful moving abstract painting.  I've wanted to buy this for all my friends, but I can't seem to find even one other copy.  Meanwhile, save your money on this video. I looked at this for a couple minutes, and then through it out.",1265414400,2,775,4.422535211267606
8143607,5,B000I2J7TA,Excellent viewing and very entertaining.  This video is excellent for graphic artists and artists in general.  It could also be used very effectively at dance or any kind of parties.  Wonderful production.,1241654400,3,205,5.34375
8143608,5,B000I2J7TA,"This is great filmmaking! Iconic shapes and colors that drift pleasingly into your eyes and stick with you after viewing. Check out the official description below.

""Color + Modulation is an alluring collection of eight 16mm films that have been painstakingly hand painted frame-by-frame and digitally manipulated on a desktop computer - creating an optically smooth ambient experience.

Working with acrylic & metallic paints as well as with a pallet of permanent ink pens and spray paint canisters this film project took 7 years to complete.

Described as both visually stunning and atmospherically beautiful, Color + Modulation transforms a television or video screen into an abstract canvas full of playful motion and smooth explosions of color and shape.""",1204070400,7,760,5.423728813559322
