Forget Tony Robbins for your daily dose of anti  depressant motivation, if you are not laughing hysterically after watching  CLEESE, Robbins has no hope. Recomended without any hesitation.

477862,5,6302541743,"I ordered this product as a Valentine gift along with Keeping Up Appearances for my wife.  I simply love Brit humor.  It is clean, fun and something the entire family can enjoy.  I don't particularly care for humor that has to use foul language or make political statements at others expense.  This series does not do that.  As a matter of fact, it is so darn funny I actually got my kids and grandkids watching Fawlty Towers.  The only problem is, I really, really wish John Cleese would have produced many, many more episodes of Fawlty Towers.  I mean I watch this over and over again and still laugh at the same stuff.  Wife does the same and she simply loves John Cleese.",1520035200,,675,4.430894308943089
477863,5,6302541743,"Brilliant! The trials and tribulations of Basil Fawlty and his small English hotel. He is accompanied by his wife Sybil, hostess Polly and his bell hop Manuel(whose English leaves much to be desired). Poor Basil attempts to be perfect but seems to always falls short with hilarious results. Each episode follows Basil's attempt to find this perfection. The show has a great cast of regulars and plays their contributions to the limit. Overall a laugh riot.",1519430400,,456,5.0131578947368425
477864,5,6302541743,Hysterically funny! My family laughs through each episode and they never get old!,1519084800,,81,5.3076923076923075
477865,5,6302541743,"Nowhere in the credits does it say that ""Fawlty Towers"" is actually based on true events, but John Cleese has repeatedly admitted that the character of Basil Fawlty is modeled after a hotel proprietor the members of Monty Python's Flying Circus met in real life.

As bewildering as the stay in that very hotel must have been, it obviously inspired Cleese and Connie Booth, to whom he was married at the time, to come up with a memorable show that has aged astoundingly well - although ""Fawtly Towers"" has been with me for a while, I find most of the episodes as funny today as when I first became aware of the series on a day I picked up a copy of ""The Germans"" in a small shop in Ireland. Back then, I bought the VHS tape out of sheer curiosity - even while I was a great Monty Python's fan back then, I had never heard of ""Fawlty Towers"" before (it would be years before a badly dubbed version would appear on German television), but I guessed that anything that John Cleese was involved in, couldn't really be bad.

When I first watched the ""The Germans"" episode, I literally howled with laughter, and even today I know whole passages from that episode by heart. Among others, the episode features what today is probably the most famous ""Fawlty Towers"" quote of the all, namely ""Don't mention the war"" - a line that in the mind of a rather paranoid Basil Fawlty is the best advice when it comes to dealing with guests from Germany. Alas, mentioning the war is exactly what Fawlty himself seems unable to avoid, and in end the blundering hotel owner once again succeeds in utterly annoying his guests.

Other personal highlights include the episode ""The Builders"" in which Fawlty commissions a band of Irish builders with reconstruction work inside the hotel - unbeknownst to his wife Sybil, who is aware that builder O'Riley and his men mightwell  be the cheapest gang you can hire, but are sadly lacking with regard to professionalism. O'Riley - a character who is as stage Irish as it gets - is just one of a number of truly memorable, endearing characters that turn up in Fawlty's Hotel; others include a retired British major who is constantly on the road from tipsy to turvy, Basil's resolute wife Sybil, hard-working chamber-maid Polly and, of course, Manuel, the Spanish waiter (""I speak good English - I learn it from abook ... !"")

If you're a fan of Monty Python's, you're probably familiar with Basil Fawlty and his antics. And if not? Look forward to a classic British comedy series offering lots of bizarre situations and unforgettable characters - ""Fawlty Towers"" is mandatory viewing, and the ""Complete Collection"" does the show justice.",1519084800,,2655,4.676659528907923

Yes he has made some unforgettable movies; but it is also the crew of Faulty Towers you watch this for. Everyone has a favorite episode and mine is Basil the Rat. I would go into detail yet just incase you missed one I'd rather it be a surprise.

The basic situation is that there is a small hotel called ""Fawlty Towers"" after the proprietors Mr. & Mrs. Fawlty. We get a mixture of cerebral and slapstick humor as Basil tries to promote the hotel and many times his schemes backfire. Of course this would not be so funny without all the supporting characters helping snowball small situations into something ridiculously absurd.

Manuel is an annoying one joke character.  Whenever anyone says anything to him he responds  ""Que? Que?""  Mildly amusing the first time, but by the hundredth time you may have a different opinion.  Also what is that woman who plays Basil Fawlty's wife doing in a sit-com?  She is so grim that she sucks the very possibility of humor right out of the room.  I understand that she's supposed to be the straight woman to all of the zaniness but come on.  The fact that John Cleese shrieks half his lines doesn't help either.

Obviously they're the same shows (filmed on 16mm or whatever they used back then) so don't expect it to look like Modern Family, etc. I think I was expecting too much out of them being ""REMASTERED"". But I'm glad I bought this DVD set; it's worth the dough. The comedy still holds up because it wasn't written around current affairs.

479424,5,6302541743,"An extremely funny series that bears rewatching just for all of the quick witty humor, the goofy visual slapstick, and just to watch poor, befuddled Basil Fawlty try desperately to work his way out of ridiculous situations at his hotel. The timing of the gags is remarkable, and you need subtitles just to keep up with some of the zany dialog. ""The Germans"" would have to be the best of the series, with John Cleese revisiting his Monty Python ""silly walk"" while doing an atrocious Hitler impression to the shock and horror of his German hotel guests. Sure, the series can be a tad offensive with some of it's dialog (and far from politically correct) and there's an occasional scantly-clad individual, but otherwise the series is driven by very clever and hilarious dialog and goofy slapstick (poor Manuel).

On a recent rewatch I was interested to see David Kelly of ""Waking Ned Devine"" as the inept repairman in episode ""The Builders"". Another good episode in a very funny series.",1451952000,,983,4.816568047337278

479430,5,6302541743,Probably my favorite comedy series ever.,1449705600,,40,5.833333333333333
479431,5,6302541743,"After appearing in the groundbreaking series ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" John Cleese co-wrote and starred in a more traditional British sitcom entitled ""Fawlty Towers."" Accurately described as a fast-paced farce, six episodes were originally broadcast in 1975, while the final six episodes were originally broadcast in 1979. In addition to playing Polly, Connie Booth co-wrote the episodes with John. They were married during the first season of the series, but had divorced before the second season. As a testament to their talent, there is no discernible difference in the characters between the two seasons. Prunella Scales played the domineering Sybil Fawlty, Basil's wife. The English actor Andrew Sachs played Manuel, the hapless waiter from Barcelona, who is trying to learn English, and is fiercely loyal to Basil. Special mention must be made of Major Gowen, played by Ballard Berkeley. He has retired from the military, and is a permanent resident at the hotel. The Major is also permanently befuddled, and spends most of his time drinking in the hotel's bar.

What makes Basil such a fascinating character are his contradictions. He fawns over British lords and ladies, but openly shows contempt for everyone else. He has a dominating personality, yet is henpecked and afraid of his wife. Similarly, the show's dialogue is very witty, yet a good deal of the comedy comes from physical humor. ""The Germans"" episode is my favorite, when Basil admonishes his staff to not mention the war. After getting hit on the head several times and suffering from a concussion, he can't refrain from mentioning Hitler and the war. Basil's walk - a combination of the Minister of Silly Walks and a goose-stepping Nazi - is the most outrageous, hilarious and memorable scene in the entire series. The remastering of the series is superb; the show looks like it was filmed in high-definition. Every episode includes a commentary by John Cleese. The bonus disc includes 2009 interviews with John Cleese, Connie Booth, Prunella Scales, and Andrew Sachs, as well as older interviews with Cleese, Sachs and Scales. Also included is a short documentary about the seaside resort of Torquay, the real hotel that Fawlty Towers is based on, and the hotel's late owner, who inspired the character of Basil Fawlty. The disc concludes with artist profiles, some brief out-takes, and a cheap tatty review. I highly recommend spending some quality time at Fawlty Towers.",1449619200,5,2453,5.163316582914573

What we were so crazy about is no longer so hot now. We have moved on, more spoiled, acting as well as story line and script of series have evolved to a higher plane. Example, Marlon Brando was once my favorite actor. In yet another wave of nostalgia I purchased a whole load of dvd's. Once again I arrived at the same conclusion. It is the dynamics of movies. They have become better and we are used to those better experiences and well my excursions to the past will slow down.

480306,2,6302541743,"John Cleese based this series on an experience he had had with a very rude hotel proprietor.  Yes, it's meant to be a farce, yes, it has stereotypical characters, but it seems that so many people rate this series along with Citizen Kane.  I suspect Cleese himself must have been shocked by just how highly-regarded this series had become.

Face it, the proprietor is simply a jerk.  Rude, obnoxious, nasty, and screaming like a banshee, occasionally slipping into sycophancy whenever the occasion comes.  Fawlty gets into all sorts of scrapes, often caused by his own folly, and everyone else has to put up with it.  The series might have really been good if there were some reason to root for Fawlty-but there isn't.

Yes, sometimes it can be very clever.  Fawlty schemes to hide his gambling winnings from his wife-but his efforts fail even when they go perfectly according to plan.  But there are ridiculous jokes, such as the overdone joke about forgetting his wife's anniversary, and much of the humor involves ""the funny little foreign man"" Manuel or other ethnic stereotypes, such as the proper epithet for Indians-which is more offensive than funny.

Fawlty Towers was very funny at times, but it's hardly the greatest sitcom ever.  I've found more laughs in less famous ones.",1424908800,2,1284,4.898148148148148

About a selfimportant man and his huffy wife who thinks he's a self important twit, while being an annoying  one herself. The dynamics between them and Manuel, their waiter from Barcelona who hardly speaks English is a constant meal of sight gags, misunderstandings and John Cleese's patented exasperated outrage and bluster.

480378,5,6302541743,"Hotel owner Basil Fawlty has a farcical point of view of life that defies normalcy and which effortlessly gets him into trouble.  To extricate himself, Basil effortlessly designs and uses extreme, magnificent, outlandish planning to get out of trouble.  Long suffering wife and sometimes explosive Sybil, seems to be bored with her ability to expect and predict lunacy.  She has at times wondered why she ever married this nut case - but she hangs on.  The chambermaid, Polly, a struggling artist, is sympathetic to her employer's woes and tries to help him.  She does so as directed but her aid causes escalation because Basil's impatience requires him to micromanage the plan to a deeper disaster.  Manuel.  Ah, Manuel; from Barcelona, the hapless waiter who takes the brunt and blame for most if not all of Basil's antics to extricate himself out of trouble and get back at some of his interesting and at times eccentric hotel guests.

Some of the humor has historic aspects that may not now seem appropriate or funny, just like standup comedy of 90 years ago is not as funny to today's audiences.  However, there are many zany, crazy moments, and plots that defy logic, sanity and improbable successes that somehow end up as success in the mind of the oblivious Basil Fawlty.  This man's particular paradigm of life as it should be, is meant to be enjoyed by all.  These twelve shows and cast of many delightful characters will provide you lots of fun.

481005,5,6302541743,"Dont know how much more you can say. John Cleese is a tour de force as a snooty,nosey and utterly belligerent hotelier on the ""English Riviera"" in this 12 episode drama that was made in 2 distinct -6 episode segments 5 years apart . Co-written and co-starring was his wife at the time,Connie Booth, the show takes place almost exclusively in the hotel's interior. Some people don't always understand British humor,but there is no problem here with any acquired taste. Cleese and Booth have taken farce with a fair amount of slapstick and turned it into almost non-stop sight and sound gags. Prunella Scales as his long suffering wife,Andrew Sachs is hilarious as the bellboy/waiter from Barcelona and Booth who plays the maid make the ensemble a formidable group at 'Fawlty Towers'. This show isn't just funny,it's fall on the floor funny and though the show is now 40 years old it still works. I prefer the tapes to having to watch it on public-TV with all of the endless begging for your money interrupting these glorious and timeless comedies.",1413331200,6,1046,4.816666666666666

No laugh track and it was truly a comedy without too much slap stick but had many situations that happened in their Bed and Breakfast hotel. The cast worked wonderfully together and John Cleese was the ultimate inn keeper always getting into situations that made one laugh.  The others in the group are excellent also.  If you love comedy without all that ""stupid"" background laugh chatter, you'll enjoy it.

481480,5,6302541743,"This show is one of the most brilliant examples of timeless comedy I've ever seen. It's slapstick, but it's intelligent. It's chaotic, but it flows well. It's over-the-top, but you can relate. The comedy draws from interesting likeable characters in fairly realistic hotel based scenarios and watching it all fall apart as they scramble to pick up the pieces, instead of crude, stupid gross-out humor that most comedies of today rely on, with lazy writing playing to the dumbest of audiences. The writing here is outstanding, and clearly a labor of love. The show also serves as an excellent example of quitting while you're ahead. With only twelve episodes, it leaves you wanting more, which is far better than overstaying your welcome and becoming boring.",1402876800,,757,5.064

This is a wickedly, painfully funny series.

The picture in the edition is so much better than the original broadcast and our old VCR tapes were. The digital re-mastering fixed a lot of problems. The flimsy sets really show up now. They were probably built by O'Reilly. The color is still flat from the original videotaping (typical BBC rubbish camerawork through the 80's), but the show is so good that really doesn't matter.

The interviews are a newer set, They're packed with tidbits of behind the scenes information. Most of it isn't new to us, but it's still amusing.

It made for a longer viewing time and BORING! I had to Fast Forward each time between the episodes! It would of been great if the interviews were saved at the END to view instead of between each episode! I was just looking at The Complete Collection Remastered to see IF it had the same Interviews in between each episodes and it looks like it does so I won't be buying it and just stick to the VHS edition.,1394323200,,542,4.171428571428572
481783,5,6302541743,"This is John Cleese at his best as Basil Fawlty the owner of a hotel called Fawlty Towers. The show has a great supporting cast also.

Here are my favorite episodes:

A Touch of Class - Basil places an ad in the paper to attract a better class of people to stay at the hotel. But a con man posing as Lord Melbury decides to stay at the hotel. This is a very funny episode which provides a great start for this series.

The Hotel Inspectors - Sybil (Basil's wife) tells Basil that she has heard a group of hotel inspectors are in town. Basil thinks he knows which guest it is and the fun begins.

Gourmet Night - Basil decides to have gourmet night at the hotel to bring in a better class of people to the hotel. But the new cook gets drunk and everything goes wrong after that.

The Germans - Basil tells the staff ""Don't mention the war"" when a group of Germans are staying at the hotel. But of course he can't seem to follow his own instructions.

Waldorf Salad - Basil tries to fill in for the cook who leaves early. Of course he messes everything up when trying to serve a couple staying at the hotel.

Basil The Rat - this was my favorite episode overall. Manuel the waiter has a pet rat which he named Basil. Unfortunately the rat is loose when a health inspector is in the hotel. Watching Basil (John Cleese) trying to hide Basil (the rat) from the hotel inspectors is hysterical.

My least favorite episode was The Builders. But even a ""bad"" episode of Fawlty Towers is better than the best episode of most other comedies.",1394150400,,1530,4.288194444444445

481785,5,6302541743,"Bar none...NOTHING on TV, past or present, English or American...is as funny as this!!  Seriously!!  Now, some come VERY close (Monty Python, The Young Ones), but this towers above all else...so much lunacy and originality in one short, tidy, compact little package.  I used to have the first set, which I had bought based on hearsay, people mentioning that ""Fawlty Towers"" is the ""Sistine Chapel Of Sitcoms"" for instance...and I agreed...I laughed so hard I almost bust a gut...but I had to sell a lot of things to acquire some needed cash, and haven't seen this show in quite a while.  I remembered how much of a joy it was to watch, and always loved John Cleese's work, both comedic and dramatic, like on the Harry Potter movies.

Well, to my delight and surprise, I came upon this newer & improved set at the library...promptly took it out, and was delighted and reminded how superb this show is, top to bottom...from the writing (amazing and movie-worthy), to the acting, attention to detail, and the utter bravery to stick to the original vision and just ""go for it"", no matter the situation, as silly and perverse as they may be.  These episodes (and whole series really) is like a favourite album by your fave band...it always gives and gives, it's an utter delight, reveals new details with each sitting...and it's only 12 episodes, so each one is like a fave song...and you can always go back to it and watch each one over and over without getting sick of it.

This series is better than most US sitcoms because it just goes for it into wacky lunacy, physical slapstick (surprised no one got seriously hurt!!) & classic British farce, without losing the sense of dialogue or plot.  The writing (mostly by stars John Cleese and then-wife Connie Booth...who plays the utterly sane straight-woman maid/waitress Polly) is brilliant and timeless...this stuff just does NOT get old!!  The characters are iconic...Cleese who plays the exasperated and totally RUDE Basil Fawlty, Prunella Scales who plays his too-serious wife Sybil...Connie Booth as Polly and, oh gosh, Andrew Sachs as the English-impaired, waiter-in-training from Barcelona, Manuel...what a fun bunch!!

This set is so fun, and the special features as good as the episodes...it's great that Cleese looks back on this series with affection, not negativity...this series clearly has a place in his heart, as it should...this show was as good as comedy gets, and even moreso...this thing should set the standard and I think it has...its rep is only growing plus it seems to get new fans every week, which is why ""Fawlty Towers"" never goes out of style.  Now, I read that Bob Newhart's show ""Newhart"" was an American show based on ""Fawlty Towers""...but the only similarity is that both are based out of a hotel & its staff...I canNOT see how ""Newhart"" is as funny as ""Fawlty Towers"", no way no HOW...nothing against the funny Bob Newhart though.

PS...Also, I LOVE the fun details on the show too, like the misspelled signs, hahaha...bring on the riff raff!!",1393891200,,3024,4.8732943469785575

The Pilot episode for Fawlty Towers was made in Black and White.  A common practice 'in the day.'  However, that episode is 'Brilliant' also, and very hard to find !

So, there are 13 of these 'Brilliant' jewels !

Hope you can find the 13th episode...  It is more than worthy to be included in your library !  Luckily, I have it. All 13 episodes fit on one extended play VCR tape !  (The episodes were 25 min each, so on a six hour tape, 13 episodes just fit !)

(You will find that 'Are You Being Served ?' also has a BW Pilot Episode. Look for it !)

THIS IS A MUST BUY / HAVE FOR 'ENGLISH HUMOUR' FANS...  HELL, FOR ANYBODY, EVERYBODY...  BUY IT, GET THE POPCORN GOING AND GET READY FOR AN EVENING OF LAUGHTER !  YOU'LL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN....  (SMILES)

Here's an addendum: If you've ever worked in the hospitality service industry, you will find that all of the episodes ring ABSOLUTELY TRUE !' From 'customers/guests' to 'staff. ' Outside workmen, Health Inspectors, Reviewers, everything 'rings' so true ! What can go wrong, DOES go wrong for poor embattled 'Basil.' You've got to buy/watch.

I cannot recommend this series highly enough.  It is a short lived series that you can watch in a single sitting, but it will have your sides splitting, & it is great to show at parties.

So many popular modern comedies draw from John Cleese, and Fawlty Towers is chock-full of excellent comedy to draw from.
I actually like this better than Monty Python, because you don't have to take a break from it to not hate it.  Monty Python wears on you, so it's great to watch every now and again, but if you watch it too often, it feels childish and irritating.  Fawlty Towers deals with a much more mundane subject matter, reigning in the comedians to play in a much less abrasive realm.",1361145600,,729,4.338235294117647

483157,5,6302541743,"For our nation's notoriously short memory a comedy series from the 1970's seems as ancient as the Fall of Rome. By that I do not refer to the season. This series debuted in 1975, one of the years a number of our college campuses claimed to have invented sex. By contrast Basil Fawlty, the lead character played by John Cleese, was hopelessly repressed, as blissfully insensitive as they come and possibly, some might add, as self-centered as our culture has generally become today. Cleese and his then wife and co-star, Connie Booth, did a brilliant job of writing 12 classic episodes with remarkable consistency in quality. Once writers establish such a rare, high level as their standard, all successive episodes must have become intimidating to try to emulate. I believe that accounts for the series being so short. Rather than keep cashing the checks, the writers wanted the series to end while all episodes were consistently excellent rather than continue and risk sliding into mediocrity. In any case, it was one of the shortest, and arguably, the best written comedies on TV.

This brief, physical, farcical, linguistically playful, and clever humor greet the viewer today with as much intelligence, glee and irreverence as almost 40 years ago. Each episode plays with and counter to our notions regarding good manners, guilty titillation, irrationality, as well as lampooning a variety of national, ethnic, and gender stereotypes including Brits and Yanks. It was all fair game and almost always hilarious. Even the most outrageous script still managed to avoid being outright mean or cruel. Secondly, the bigoted, vain, greedy, foolish, lazy lout called Basil, managed to end up the prime recipient of retributive justice -- to our delight -- every show. He was too thick to ever learn his lesson, thank goodness. The supporting cast was also brilliant and essential as an early triumph of an ensemble comedy.

Highly recommended for anyone who loves British humor, those who appreciate analytical comedic writing, and for all of us who can laugh at the outrageously silly. But humor, like everything else dealing in personal taste, is a highly subjective matter. If you have never seen it, please use the magic of VOD or streaming to see if you like it before you buy it.

The only criticism I have is to acknowledge that some of the plots have aspects that have not aged as well as others. We live in a different time with our own cultural and social sensibilities. For example, today humor making fun of gay stereotypes in particular is out of step with the majority of Americans and practically everyone else. IMO these jokes simply fall a bit flat today. I can't reject them solely on the basis of their being in bad taste because after all that was one of the fundamental principles of the show's humor. One could argue if it succeeded because of or in spite of its questionable taste.

Basil embodies bad taste. His countless flaws are a pantheon of human weaknesses. Much of what makes this series so endearing and enduring is that it underscores many recognizable human frailties that are just as prevalent today as they were then. Yes, if you happen to be more familiar with British culture you will get a little more out of it but it is its universal appeal that carries it. Moreover, comedy in the hands of such gifted, bright, insightful writers and such an outstanding cast will help Fawlty Towers continue to delight new generations. Basil the Rat, despite himself, has earned his place in Western comedic history today as Basil the Icon.",1360195200,,3562,4.892384105960265

483449,2,6302541743,"I have owned the VHS boxed set of Fawlty Towers for a long time, and have been waiting for the DVD version to come out for at least five years.  When it finally does come out, it is a complete disappointment, as usual.

Once again, BBC has overcompressed the show you care about so they can include a partially filled disc of Extras that no one cares about.

The set has ""Remastered"" plastered across the front, and on the startup menu of each of the shows.  The remastering must have been to reduce the video quality from the original as much as possible.

I have been on the point for years of transferring my VHS copies to DVD, since it seemed like it was never going to get released.  I think I might have gotten better quality that way, even though, per the BBC long-standing policy of assuring that classics are preserved for posterity in the shoddiest possible manner, they are recorded at four-hour format instead of two-hour like they should have been.

All twelve episodes are crammed onto two DVDs, assuring the lowest possible video quality and the maximum possible degredation.

As if that weren't enough, they make you sit through a full five minutes of FBI warnings and ads for other BBC products before you can even get to the main menu!  Hit the Stop button at any point in this process, and then the Menu button just takes you back to the beginning of the FBI warning, and you have to sit through the whole five minutes again!

Once you finally do make it to the main menu, Prunella Scales is shouting something at four times the volume of the entire rest of the disk!

I do have to admit that the extras are better than usual.  The interviews are actually interesting.  The outtakes are better than just people blowing their lines, which is all they typically consist of.  But there are only four of them.  I can't imagine they take more than five or six minutes total.

A wonderful cast that plays equally well with Cleese's near insanity. Unfortunately, there are only 12 episodes (on 2 disks) and I would much prefer 100. I hated to see it end. There is a 3rd disk with interviews, history and trivia. At 30 dollars plus, it was somewhat expensive. But, it is in a league all it's own. John Cleese is definitely a master (and Manuel, the waiter from barseloma, is the ""icing on the cake""). I laughed so much.",1346976000,,599,4.504587155963303

483700,5,6302541743,"In my opinion, this is the funniest TV series ever produced. There were only 12 episodes, separated by 4 years; the first series was in 1975, the second in 1979, by which time John Cleese and Connie Booth, who wrote it, were divorced. There were no more episodes, but what we're left with sets the standard for TV comedy.

Each episode is crammed full of funny lines and equally funny physical comedy. There's so much going on it's impossible to take it all in at one viewing. I've been watching it for 37 years now and it's still as funny as when I first saw it. Cleese, as Basil Fawlty the social-climbing hotel keeper, uses his unique physical attributes and his manic delivery to the utmost. Prunella Scales, as his acid-tongued wife, is a magnificent foil and Andrew Sachs as Manuel the trainee waiter (""He's from Barcelona"" is the excuse for everything he does wrong) is one of the great comic creations in all of TV.

If by any chance you haven't seen Fawlty Towers, (or Farty Towels or Watery Fowls- even the credits are hilarious) just sit back and watch and prepare to fall about laughing. If you don't find it funny, well, I'll send Basil round to insert a garden gnome in you.",1342224000,2,1188,4.52093023255814

This experience led to the development of ""Fawlty Towers,"" a sitcom that originally appeared on the BBC in 1975 and 1979.  In the series, Cleese plays Basil Fawlty, manager of the Fawlty Towers hotel in Torquay on the Devon coast.

Fawlty (mis)manages the hotel with his wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales), and with hired help Polly (Connie Booth) and Manuel (Andrew Sachs).  The four trifle with both the guests and each other, and the show is witty with fast-paced dialogue and comedy of errors-style humor.  Some of the situations the crew stumbles into involve botched hotel repairs, restaurant meals gone wrong, and an untimely death.

The first two discs in this set contain the twelve episodes of the series, and there is a third bonus disc recalling this classic series that containing interviews, outtakes, and other material.",1338854400,2,1104,5.955696202531645

483704,5,6302541743,"I have ALWAYS loved Fawlty Towers. I only reason I purchased the remastered version is for the interviews. I enjoyed them immensely. My question as to why the series wasn't continued has been answered. Apparently there had been enormous pressure to continue the series, but John Cleese and Connie Booth didn't want to continue them because they really believed they had reached their goal with the 12 episodes.
I also did not know that Connie Booth is an American actress. Another surprising thing is that The Builders episode is John Cleese's least favorite episode (it's my favorite).
I also enjoyed the interview with Andrew Sachs. It was interesting to find out that his first language is German.
I wish Connie Booth had also participated in the interviews. Apparently she has always refused to comment on Fawlty Towers until 2009 in a documentary. Too bad. I would have loved to hear her thoughts on the show.

If you're not interested in the interviews, don't purchase the remastered version. The interviews are the only difference. I'm glad I got it. I did recoup 3/4 of the money back, by selling my older set.",1334966400,4,1118,4.853403141361256

In the typical short but sweet 12 episodes (2 series) it became an instantly memorable classic comedy.

Basily Fawlty (John Cleese) is the owner with his wife Sybill (Prunella Scales) of the quite infamous 'Fawlty Towers' Hotel in the English Riviera resort town of Torquay (Which is also where I happen to come from)

Along with the staff of Polly the maid (Connie Booth), Manuel the Waiter from Barcelona (Andrew Sachs) and Terry the chef (Brian Hall) much mayhem and chaos ensue with Basil landing them all in situations that end up with him ultimately paying the price for his bizarre behaviour.

There are a couple of regular guests at Fawlty Towers that add to the confusion, Major Gowen (Ballard Berkley) and Miss Tibbs & Miss Gatsby (Gilly Flower & Renee Roberts) who seem to enjoy staying at the Hotel even though Basil is frequently quite rude to them.

It's probably the most insightful DVD commentary I've ever heard, as Cleese, 30 years later, shows point by point how he and Connie Booth polished the scripts and how he thinks the writing, the performance or the direction could have been improved. You'll find he is a tough critic of his own work, but at some points he can't help it, the pride shines through at having created these miniature masterpieces. Watch each episode as broadcast first, then watch it again with the commentary on, and you'll learn a lot if you're so inclined. It's a master class in comedy writing. Or just sit back, hit ""play"" and laugh yourself hoarse. The only comparison is to early Marx Brothers or perhaps some of the great ""I Love Lucy"" episodes. Cleese's goal was to create, not a typical sitcom, but a classic farce, and he succeeded. In 2001 I was visiting the UK and there was one of those pop culture countdown shows on one of the TV channels, ""The 100 Greatest TV Characters.""

Mr. Cleese brought together a gaggle of troupers and became an icon almost overnight.  His ability to put out a weekly comedy sitcom made life so much easier as we were looking for anything to take us away.  As the years went on and age overtook me, I found ""Fawlty Towers"" and was able to get a giggle again.
There is nothing out there today that can compare to this brand of comedy.  It will live on longer than the dvd set I possess.

484129,5,6302541743,"I don't believe there is any doubt that Fawlty Towers is the funniest show ever! There are only twelve episodes, but how could there be anymore?

Fawlty Towers is just so well written and filled with so much comedy it would probably have been impossible for the high standard of these shows to have continued. I was fortunate enough to have met John Cleese and work with him for about a week on a film. I asked him after he mentioned he'd like to do more television whether he'd ever make more Fawlty Towers. Cleese responded that he couldn't because more episodes could never live up to the public's expectations. I believe that he is absolutely correct.

The show has various types of comedy, but I believe farce is the main ingredient. Although there is a non-Spaniard playing Manuel the Spanish waiter, who speaks little English and understands less the character is show in a sympathetic light. He is not being made fun  of because he is a foreigner. In fact, the person who comes off the worst in this show is Basil Fawlty himself! Every nationality - almost - is made sport of in the show. Americans, Japanese and Norweigens, Irish, Greeks, French, Germans and most especially the English.

Literally there are laughs all around. There is ample helpings of the comedy of embarrassment, the deaf, senile, homosexual, upper class, lower class, the dead, old people, children, and psychiatrists are all made fun of. It is a very inclusive show which is NOT to be taken seriously.

We should all be thankful that we have 12 episodes of this great series. The extras on this complete collection are very good as well. The interviews with Cleese and Sachs are especially good.",1271548800,,1677,4.72945205479452

His reminiscences about the regular cast members as well as the guests are really enjoyable, but the insights about the show's creation were unenlightening. His commentary was often incommoded by his laughter while he watched the episodes. This laughter was regularly accompanied by a horrid wracking cough which made me want to turn off the feature. The other special features were basically transferred from the previous box-set. The remastering was clear in both picture and sound. If you do not already own the F.T. box set, I would buy this one for the remastering and the previously unavailable commentaries (if you can handle John's coughing fits).",1269475200,19,815,5.044444444444444

484213,5,6302541743,"They only made twelve episodes....and then they stopped.
They could have gone further, but maybe Cleese was doing other things, maybe the money wasn't there, I'm not sure, it's not important. Bottom line is that, in my opinion, this ranks up there with the funniest TV shows of all-time.

Here's an example: in the crabby deaf old lady (Mrs. Richards) episode, Basil has been betting on the horses, just to try and win some of his own money, and to try to squeeze out from under the iron thumb of wife Sibyl. Of course, the domineering Sibyl vehemently disapproves of Basil doing just about anything on his own. She has suspicions, and cooly says, ""Basil, you know what I'm going to do if I find out you've been betting on the horses, don't you?"" Basil shakes his head and does his best to appear studious, then mutters under his breath, out of her earshot, ""You'll have to sew 'em back on first!""

That is, his testicles! No American show would have been witty or daring enough to get that line in, forty years ago.

Same episode: Mrs. Richards and Basil in her hotel room, and she's complaining about the view. Basil sarcastically replies, ""And just what did you expect to see out of a Torquay hotel room window? Sydney Opera House, perhaps? Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Herds of wildebeests sweeping majestically across the plains?""

The writing, the characters, the situations, the dialogue, it's all perfect.
I've seen some of these episodes a dozen times, and I've never gotten tired of them. This latest remastering is beautiful, particularly because of the improved picture quality and the inclusion of Cleese's commentary.

Here is a listing in no order of the TV shows I think are particularly funny, definitely a cut above your ordinary sitcom: Larry Sanders (may be the funniest show ever on TV, this side of pond or not); Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, SCTV, The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, Keeping Up Appearances, The League of Gentlemen, Little Britain, and Monty Python's Flying Circus.",1268092800,,2008,4.825581395348837

484373,5,6302541743,"If you like British humor, if you like John Cleese, and if you like Monty Python humor, then you will understand the humor in this DVD. John Cleese runs a hotel, his wife abhors him and thinks he's a ninny, and the hired help for the hotel are hopelessly inept. A basis for most of us to be able to relate to Basil (who unfortunately actually is incompetent), the poor guy played by John Cleese, and that role is not quite as squeamish as John Lithgow is in 3rd Rock From The Sun, but along the same kind of humor. Prunella Scales is hilarious as an overbearing conceited British woman (the wife in the series), and the irreverent humor clashing in political incorrectness with German stereotypes who happen to be staying at the hotel is wonderful. Researching the hotel a bit by Googling ""Fawlty Towers"" gives you a marvelous insight on how this BBC TV series was based upon a real hotel, and the main character by John Cleese was inspired by a real person who was delightfully rude and boorish, as well as being a little bit nuts. The story's intentional complications and accidental misfires make this a very enjoyable farce about owning a hotel and trying to annoy people as much or more than they do you. I love this series, and first owned the series on VHS. Buy this DVD, you'll love it enough to want to keep watching and keep watching and keep watching until you've seen them all, and then start over again to see them over and over.

And if you're still watching FT on VHS, you really must upgrade!  The colors and sharpness look like a live broadcast.

There are 6 episodes on each of 2 discs, and each of these include 2 alternate commentaries to choose from (each series' director or Cleese), in addition to the normal mono audio track.  A third disc contains interviews and a couple of other features which are well-documented in other reviews or in the item description here on Amazon.  I was glad to see the extended interviews, as the 'Complete' set seemed to have less interview content from the other actors than this 'Remastered' set.  The top menu animations and artwork are also inspired -- BBC did a good job of this, and I wish other DVD labels would invest a little more in their products this way.  The beginning of each disc does have a couple of long leaders of information which you have to ""next chapter"" through if you don't want to see it, because the ""menu"" button will not otherwise take you to the menu until you've been forced to watch it.

If you already have the previous 'Complete Series' set mentioned above and are wondering if it's worth upgrading, I think real Fawlty fans have to, just for the extra special feature content alone.  If you ware just looking a good DVD version of the 12 episodes, either version would probably suffice, although this latest version currently seems to be less expensive when purchased new.  I cannot help wondering if BBC did this remaster to also prepare for a blu-ray version one day (or some such HD standard), but for the $26 Amazon price when I ordered, it just didn't seem worth waiting for any potential HD release.

484456,5,6302541743,"Say hello to Fawlty Towers: The Complete Collection Remastered! This newly-remastered collection of the classic BBC comedy series will have you laughing like almost nothing else!

I'd had surprisingly little exposure to Fawlty Towers until fairly recently. Back when I was a wee lad I remember seeing about two episodes of the show. Lately I've seen a heck of a lot more and found it to be one of the best, most consistently funny shows ever made!

The series follows the lives of people staying and working in Fawlty Towers, what is possibly the worst hotel in all of England. It's located on the British coast where, it turns out, people actually voluntarily go for vacations during the summer (having swam in the Pacific Ocean in an area just about as far north as Southern England, I think they're quite mad). The hotel is run by the impossible-to-deal-with Basil Fawlty (John Cleese). With him are his long-suffering wife, longer-suffering maid and even longer-suffering Spanish bellhop, the scene stealing Manuel (Andrew Sachs).

The plots tend to be very simple, and occasionally reveal a great deal about the age of the show (it was made in 1975 and 1979), but the execution is genius. The comic timing on display is incredible, particularly that of Sachs and Cleese.

This newly remastered version of the show contains all twelve episodes (12?! That's it?! Not a lot, I know, but the recent great shows The Office and Extras also only have twelve standard episodes each), of the show. You also get a whole raft of extra features, including commentaries, interviews, outtakes, a little booklet and even a Torquay Tourist Guide! Nice!

This is a very funny show and a heck of a good deal. I can't possibly praise it enough. Go pick it up!",1257465600,6,1745,4.822742474916388
484457,5,6302541743,"Having purchased the previous Fawlty Towers complete series on DVD set three years ago, I was skeptical as to whether the ""Remastered"" version was worth it.  I can assure you that it is.  John Cleese's hilarious and insightful commentary alone is worth the extra investment.  As well, the sound and picture quality are noticeably better, adding to the enjoyment.  Highly recommended even if you have previously purchased the series on VHS or DVD.

If you don't own these programs already then you've come along at the right time. This will be the best money you've spent in quite a while. This is one of the classic sitcoms of all time. Each meticulously crafted episode is so crammed with hilarious lines and situations that when you recall it later you won't believe that so many things happened in one half-hour show.  Cleese was really the first to put such an unpleasant character at the center of a sitcom. It would be tried again with the sadly brief 'Buffalo Bill' and with more success with 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'.

484605,5,6302541743,"I had to permanently donate my original DVD set of Flatery Owls to a friend who, incredibly, had never seen the series, despite her self-professed love for British comedy.  She had heard of Benny Hill, Dave Allen, On The Buses, Are You Being Served, etc.  In a sense, however, I could sort of understand why.  As other reviewers have said, this is a unique series, and due to it's painfully short 12-episode duration, is not aired in the same way as others.  Here in the US, for example, it's usually shown in sequence during a one-day PBS pledge-drive.  If that's not how she watched TV, then she might indeed miss it.  But the comedy style of insults, slapstick, wittiness, double-entendres, etc, are not quite like other British sitcoms, or Monty Python or anything really:  it's a style of comedy all its own.  The closest style I might compare it too is some of the best, live-action plays I've seen, although not too many people see plays these days.  But I think it's a mistake to try to deconstruct Fawlty Towers too much in order to see what makes it so funny, because I find it ruins the fun and spontaneity.  For me, this series is simply the benchmark for the very best comedy writing I have seen, and I can watch it every year and thoroughly enjoy it (which maybe speaks little for me).  I liked Fawlty Towers as a youngster and I still like it now, even though my taste in TV and writing has changed vastly over 30 years.

The set has several interesting interviews from the principal actors included, and compared to many modern DVD's it might provide more extras in this way, although I found myself wanting a little more than what was included.  At the time, however, I had paid $64.99 USD, while as of today, the set currently sells for around $24.  The transfer is good -- it's not HDTV, but images are crisp and colors very good, as is the sound.  If you grew up watching this on analog TV or video cassettes, it's quite a step up.  Certain fashion styles aside, the series certainly does not look it's age.  Although it might be overkill, I am hoping BBC might still consider a 1080p version of the set one day.

Other reviews thoroughly-describe the content and pretext of the episodes.  I will only add that, if by some chance you are one of those who haven't seen Fawlty Towers yet, and enjoy comedy to any degree, you really must see this.  It's been 35 years since the first 6 episodes were made, yet I still occasionally hear people I don't know quote lines from the show...usually insults...a testament to the lasting effect the show has upon those who've seen it.  And the next time you hear someone order a Lemon Squash, or tell someone to stop talking about the war, you'll understand at least one more reason why people within earshot might start snickering.",1250467200,,2790,4.528942115768463
484606,5,6302541743,"Nothing really needs to be said about this classic British sitcom, except that it contains some of the most brilliant, most hilarious, and most humiliatingly ghastly moments in the entire history of television.

And ""Fawlty Towers Complete Collection"" brings together the entire series in all its embarrassing avalanchal glory. It's one of those universally funny TV shows, all about the undignified exploits of a perpetually hostile, repressed and tetchy hotel manager, and the more competant staff who try to keep thngs sane, written with demented zeal (""That's Brahms! Brahms' Third Racket!"") and excellent comic acting.

Basil (John Cleese) and Sybil Fawlty (Prunella Scales) run a moderately-sized hotel in Torquay, with the assistance of the clever waittress Polly (Connie Booth) and the Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs) whose grasp of English is a work in progress. The hotel is home to a dotty old soldier, fluttery spinsters, and a revolving door of very dissatisfied customers.

Basil Fawlty (Cleese) puts out a snotty ad to attract a ""better class of customer,"" which attracts a pleasant aristocrat. Basil fawns revoltingly over the man, neglecting the other guests. But savvy waittress Polly (Connie Booth) discovers that another guest (who Basil snubs because he's Cockney) is a member of the CID -- and that Basil is in danger of handing his valuable coins over to a con man.

And it's not the last disaster that Basil only manages to make much worse: an inept gang of builders are called in while Sybil is away; a bunch of couples seem to be cheating on one another; four Germans arrive at the hotel just in time for Basil to suffer a brain-scrambling head injury; a deaf woman causes general hotel mayhem; and the creme-de-la-creme of Torquay society arrive for a ""Goumet Night,"" just in time for the chef to get drunk after Manuel rejects his advances. Hilarity (and roast ducks) ensue.

An American tourist who demands a Waldorf salad -- after the cook leaves for the day -- ends up tangled in Basil's web of lies; an overnight guest expires in bed, leading to a frantic cover-up; an anniversary party is wrecked when Sybil storms out just as the guests arrive. And after a health inspector condemns Fawlty Towers, Basil discovers that Manuel has a pet rat (""Is Siberian hamster -- a filagree!"") -- which is soon running wild through the hotel.

Anyone who's sick of the recycled sitcoms (""Hot Young Urbanites Fall In Love and Have Misadventures"") that pepper the TV landscape every single season might want to try ""Fawlty Towers"" -- the humour is still fresh, the writing is hilarious (""If the guest isn't singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning,' I don't immediately think 'Oh, there's another snuffed it in the night'""), and the actors were great at physical comedy.

Basically every episode is about a bad situation that Basil makes infinitely worse, until the entire episode is a landslide of lies, offenses and disasters. Each episode is full of gags (Basil strangling the gnome), misunderstandings (""There's a kipper sticking out of your vest""), and plots that revolve mainly around Basil's increasingly frantic efforts to keep everything ""normal."" Everything gets crazier as the episodes wind on.

And Cleese's writing is typically brilliant here -- Basil gets most of the great lines (""Always reminds me of somebody machine-gunning a seal"""") but there are some glorious bits of dialogue from others (""Will you stop talking about the war?"" ""Me? You started it!"" ""We did not start it!"" ""Yes you did -- you invaded Poland!"").

Cleese plays Basil as a slightly deranged, high-strung, incompetent guy who treats his customers like so many itchy spots, and Prunella Scales serves as the more competent, vaguely contemptuous counterpoint to him. Connie Booth's Polly is the only truly smart and clever person in the entire hotel, and usually gets sucked into Basil's freaky schemes (""Flying Tart!""); and Andrew Sachs is rather cute and sweet as the much-abused Manuel, whose half-learned English provides quite a bit of humor (""I am from Barcelona!"").

The new edition may be worth the dip for fanatical Fawlty fans -- apparently the entire series is being restored. Additionally, Cleese has gone back to record commentaries for ALL the episodes, and there are interviews with everybody in the main cast. Sounds like it's going to be good.

""Fawlty Towers Complete Collection""  is one of those shows that shone brightly and briefly, like a fireworks display. Hilarious, uproarious, and utterly timeless.",1250294400,72,4524,5.090418353576248

If he thinks you are a lower class nobody muscling in on his Inn, he is totally obnoxious as the worst sort of English snob, nose in the air. He does his best to ignore you and if you can't be ignored, he delivers devastating put downs, one-liners which are classics in the genre.  You are just as likely to find Fawlty pawing through some guest's room (and about to be caught) as you are to find him skulking in the office trying to avoid front desk duties or making mayhem in the dining room, usually trying to favor one diner over another with his snobbish judgments.

Prunella Scales delivers the voice of reason, his wife, flawlessly.  Manuel, the barely English speaking bellhop is a bit reminiscent of Roberto Benigni in his most comic roles.  Polly the maid is a co-writer with Cleese of the show. She is so convincing as a maid that it is hard to believe she is a brilliant writer in real life.

But Cleese is the star all the way and I've always been sad there were only 12 episodes.  The classic British idea of a series is always much shorter than the American idea of a series on tv.

484609,5,6302541743,"Too bad, there are only 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers. There should have dozens of episodes. While there is talk of a remake, nobody could touch this cast featuring the genius and unknighted John Cleese who probably won't be knighted by the Queen after all. His character, Basil Fawlty, would be appalled by John Cleese's statements about their native Britain. Basil Fawlty runs a small bed and breakfast called Fawlty Towers with his long-time wife, Sybil Fawlty, played by the brilliant Prunella Scales CBE. She could become the next Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and probably will and hopefully or Lady West if her husband, Timothy West CBE, gets knighted. Cleese's wife, who plays Polly, an aspiring artist, was American born and raised Connie Booth who has become a therapist in London, England and has given up acting. Andrew Sachs plays the always funny Manuel who is from Barcelona and often the subject of Basil's anger and abuse. Poor Manuel, Sachs does him brilliantly. There are supporting characters like the two old senior ladies who are permanent residents and the late funny Berkeley Ballard as a retired military man. Fawlty Towers takes place in Torquay, a seaside town in Southern Britain. As one guest jokes about the lack of sights have been reduced to a page or a brochure.

Every episode is brilliantly mastered to fit the right effects of the audience which is constant laughter no matter how silly the circumstances or bizarre. I wished John Cleese well and I can't imagine anything that could replace Fawlty Towers. He gave us this brilliance only leaving us wanting so much more. It's hard to imagine that British sitcoms have a 6 episode season in comparison to American sitcoms where they can range from 14-22 episodes and that is recently. I loved watching guests like Geoffrey Palmer OBE and others in these episodes.",1249257600,,1867,4.908227848101266
484660,5,6302541743,"Nothing really needs to be said about the classic British sitcom ""Fawlty Towers,"" except that the third and final collection of episodes contains some of the series' most brilliant, most hilarious, and most humiliatingly ghastly moments. ""Fawlty Towers - Waldorf Salad/The Kipper and the Corpse/The Anniversary/Basil the Rat"" sends abusive hotelier Basil Fawlty through his last round of demented crises, and it's more fun than ever.

Basil's insensitivity and overambition finally get the best of him when he tries to cater to a wealthy, equally obnoxious American tourist who wants a Waldorf salad. The result: a crazy scheme in which Basil tries to pretend that the cook hasn't left for the day, and cobble together a foodstuff that he doesn't know the first thing about. And it turns out that the American isn't the only unsatisfied customer.

Then when an overnight guest expires in bed, Basil is thrown into a frenzy -- first he thinks it's because of some expired kippers he served the dead man (when he was already dead), and then he's determined to keep the death secret from all the other guests. Unfortunately, there aren't many places in a hotel that you can hide a dead body where someone won't stumble across it -- and Basil spreads the usual chaos as he and the staff stuff it in wardrobes, bedrooms and the office.

When Basil and Sybil's twentieth anniversary rolls around, Basil secretly plans a party with some old friends of theirs. Unfortunately Sybil thinks he really HAS forgotten their anniversary, and storms off just as the friends arrive -- and a frantic Basil tries to convince the other couples that Sybil's got a weird mystery illness and has NOT left him. Unfortunately, they're too determined to see her, resulting in a very weird masquerade for Polly.

And the series finale deals with what restaurants dread most: a health inspector, who deems the kitchen unsafe and unfit. While everyone tries to get the hotel shipshape, Basil discovers that Manuel has a pet rat (""Is Siberian hamster -- a filagree!"") in his room and orders it to be somehow removed from the premises. Unfortunately little Basil The Rat finds his way back into the hotel... at the same time that the health inspector returns to Fawlty Towers.

""Fawlty Towers"" is one of those shows that shone brightly and briefly, like a fireworks display -- the last four episodes of the series show little signs of slowing comic genius, and it leaves you wistfully wishing that John Cleese and Co. had managed to turn out one more season. As it is, the series ended on a high note without the jokes getting tired or old.

""Waldorf Salad"" is perhaps the weakest of these episodes, since it stretches the Basil-tries-to-pretend-the-cook-is-still-there joke to the max. But the other three are absolutely hilarious mixes of gags (the rat-in-the-purse scene), misunderstandings (""There's a kipper sticking out of your vest""), and plots that revolve mainly around Basil's increasingly frantic efforts to keep everything ""normal."" Everything gets crazier as the episodes wind on.

And Cleese's writing is typically brilliant here -- Basil gets most of the great lines (""Look, I'm just delivering a tray, right. If the guest isn't singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning,' I don't immediately think 'Oh, there's another snuffed it in the night'"") but there are some glorious bits of dialogue from others (""Don't talk to anyone, but he's dead."" ""Ah. Shot, was he?"" ""No, no. He died in his sleep."" ""In his sleep? Well, you're off your guard, you see"").

Cleese continued to play Basil as a slightly deranged, high-strung, incompetent guy who finally gets told off en masse in ""Waldorf Salad,"" and Prunella Scales serves as the more competent, vaguely contemptuous counterpoint to him. Connie Booth's Polly finally gets sick of Basil's weird ideas in ""Anniversary"" and has to be bribed into impersonating Sybil, while Andrew Sachs has a rather cute scene in the final episode where he threatens to leave if they get rid of his pet rat.

Wave a tearful farewell to ""Fawlty Towers"" in its third collection of episodes... then go eat a Waldorf salad and some overripe kippers on your anniversary, and shoot at some rats.",1248739200,3,4193,4.970042796005706
484661,5,6302541743,"What a feast for all admirers of good comedy, English humor, British sitcoms, and John Cleese. God bless him and his wife at the time and collaborator Connie Booth for brilliant flawless writing of twelve (sadly, only twelve) 30 minutes episodes and to all cast for starring in the series that went on to become the top on the list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programs drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000. Having watched all twelve episodes during last weekend, I see very clearly where my favorite comedy of all times, A Fish Called Wanda swam from. Some episodes of Fawlty Towers are simply perfect or very close to being perfect. All twelve are always funny, crazy, hilarious and never ever for a second are boring or outdated despite been made over 30 years ago. Cleese is fabulous participating in almost every scene of the show and playing rude, cheap, obnoxious, and incompetent owner of the Seaside hotel in ""English Riviera"" which he manages along with domineering, and much more confident wife Sybil (Prunella Scales). With all these characteristics, Cleese manages to make Basil Fawlty somehow sympathetic in this never ending escalation of comical frustration. The point is - the show is absolutely hilarious without ever stooping to vulgarity or stupidity. It is a highest class entertainment and I am happy that I finally was able to enjoy all 12 episodes. The show was transferred beautifully to 3 DVD Set which IMO is one of the best sets I've had pleasure to experience. Each of three DVDs comes with the nice bonus features that include among many three parts interview with John Cleese who tells in great details about the origins of the show, its production, and how much fun it was for everyone involved. Cleese recalls visiting a hotel similar to Fawlty Towers during the filming of Monty Python  series.  The hotel manager whom Cleese describes as ""He was so rude, he was wonderful"" had become an inspiration for Basil Fawlty. The interview with Prunella Scales and Andrew Sacks who was as hilarious as Cleese playing Spanish waiter/porter Manuel (""You'll have to forgive him. He is from Barcelona"") with very limited command in English also add to the great feast that Fawlty Towers has been since its original showing in the 70s. The best episode, IMO is Communication Problems which is absolute perfection. It introduces us to the ""guest from hell"" in the body of Mrs. Richards, a very demanding lady with the hearing problems and the hearing aid that she would use quite selectively. Along with this guest, Basil Fawlty has to deal with the old passion for horses betting, the avenue of pleasure that is completely closed by his bossy wife Sybil. The result is the funniest and best acting episode of all - thanks to the regular players and late Joan Sanderson who almost stole the show as Mrs. Richards. The single most hilarious scene in all episodes definitely is the one in the episode ""Germans"" and it has to do with a talking moose head. I've returned to it several times while watching the episode and the scene always brought the tears from laughing too hard. To make the long story short - watch Fawlty Towers. It's got the top position on the list of 100 Best British TV programs for very good reasons and totally deserves it. It is one of the best and funniest sitcoms ever in the TV history.",1248652800,2,3352,4.767641996557659
484662,5,6302541743,"If I have to pick the most distinguishing characteristic for Fawlty Towers, it would be that it is the funniest comedy I have seen. You can watch it many times over the years and every time you will have tears from laughing, and for days after you will be wearing a smile, with an occasional burst of laughter, to the dismay of those around you.
The show has been crafted with great attention to detail in the writing, the scenes, the filming, and does not resort to vulgarity or profanity. But beyond that, it is one of those rare, magic accomplishments that happens once in a great while, and cannot be duplicated.
Much has been written about the show, some of which I find surprising. For example, it has nothing in common with the Three Stooges. The occasional poke, or slap is in entirely different context. It usually is the culmination of a long string of frustrations. The show also has nothing in common with Monty Python, other than John Gleese is in both.

484700,2,6302541743,"Being a Python fan and a fan of some other British comedies (Good Neighbors, Are You Being Served), I was very pleased to find this complete DVD set at a used store that I shop at. Once I got it home and started watching, however, it was very clear that this type of comedy was made for people with certain tolerances. Fawlty Towers fans, I expect to get flamed for this, so flame away. The criticism I will try to make is going to be based on logic, not rants.
  First, the main character, Basil Fawlty, played by Cleese. Basil was modeled after an experience Cleese and the other Pythons had with an extremeely foul-tempered hotel owner while on holiday. Basil is brash, rude, inconsiderate, and generally painful to watch. He is a complete and utter wanker to his guests unless they are of some high social standing. Once in a while, we see Basil get his comeuppance from an overly irritated guest, or something of the like, and that's actually enjoyable, as he usually gets thumped pretty severely. Every person at one time or another has wanted to do that to someone as utterly nasty as Basil.
 Comedian Richard Briers said in his interview on the 'Good Neighbors' series that to be a comedy actor you had to exude a certain amount of vulnerability so that the the audience would care about you. Cleese's character of Basil evokes no sympathy or empathy whatsoever, as you find it impossible to relate to a man who is so deliberately narcissistic, sarcastic, and rude to his guests. Perhaps this is why John Cleese hates Britain so much, for those few individuals who are so class-conscious that they constantly trod on other people.
  Secondly, the cast. There does not seem to be any chemistry between most of the leading actors, and most of the acting seems forced, not to mention the gags. The only saving grace is Manuel the waiter, played by Andrew Sachs. There is a lot of byplay involving his difficulty communicating with the customers (and Basil) because of his difficulty learning the language.
  This series was one that I really wanted to like, and it fell very short .It's a shame they only made four seasons of Good Neighbors, as it was a fine Britcom. Perhaps I'll try 'Yes, Minister' next.",1235347200,11,2211,4.639386189258312

To each his own, I guess.

This is far from a solo Cleese show. Each of the regulars is a unique, fully realized character. It is the interplay between these characters (with each other and with Cleese) that makes the show. Compare it to some other comedy shows that have a ""star"" comedian as a lead. For example, Mork and Mindy. That is an example of a ""solo"" effort and is quite the opposite of Fawlty Towers. You don't see any of the characters in FT standing around laughing at some Cleese antic and looking like they forgot their lines or missed their cue. In FT all the actors stay in character and are generally essential to the scene they are in.

It is agreed that this is not the place if you are looking for something ""genuinely thought-provoking"" (as that other reviewer wished for). But then again, neither are any of the Monty Python movies (despite that other reviewer's belief). So yes, FT is a farce, but farce is an honorable art form. Just ask William Shakespeare and Geoffrey Chaucer, for starters.

Fawlty Towers is one of the funniest, most tightly-scripted shows ever on TV. Some of the episodes are right up there with _The Comedy of Errors_ and _The Miller's Tale_. And I think the target audience for all of these was about the same.",1229299200,,1490,4.611320754716981

484766,5,6302541743,"Much as I am loathe to start off with a cliche, cliches are cliches because they're true.

As many have said, Fawlty Towers is the single funniest TV series ever created. There's no argument, and no other series even comes close. It's like comparing the Beatles to other bands or Jimi Hendrix to other guitarists. Some artists just exist in their own singular dimension, and it's true of this show. What does one say, that it's the Mount Everest of television comedy? More like the rings of Saturn...

This masterpiece is given its proper honor in this fine box set, loaded with lengthy extras. The most surprising of these is the contemporary interview with Prunella Scales, revealing her to be a warm, charming and very sweet woman, which of course hammers home what a remarkable performance she gave in every episode of the show. And the same is true of the interview with Andrew Sachs, the immortal and incomparable Manuel.

Currently offered at a steep discount by Amazon, the price is in fact irrelevant. The set is worth twice, three times the cost, even if and perhaps especially if you've lived with the show since your youth. Every minute is just perfection, especially in terms of the writing, the quality of which is off the scale. And in every episode, episodes you may have seen dozens of times over the decades, there are countless laugh out loud scenes... even in cases where you know every line, where you anticipate every punch line, every fall, every double-take.

Most comedy doesn't bear up well to repeated playing but that's not the case here. Fawlty Towers is like a piece of great music, a classic album, in that its appeal never ends and in fact grows on the listener. It flourishes, it unfolds. In watching these episodes you see little things you never saw before, nuances of delivery that escaped you... and again, it's the writing... you relish every syllable, and if writing means something to you, you find yourself in awe of these scripts for there's not a line wasted.

I know, this review seems excessive in its praise, but I'll just end with the delicious fact that the British Film Institute named Fawlty Towers as the #1 Television Program of All Time.

484768,5,6302541743,"Fawlty Towers is one of those British sitcoms that although they haven't a high number of episodes, the quality alone is something to make it a timeless classic. I think the high number of people who wil gladly vouch for how good this sitcom is only expresses the true quality of the comedy and the cast involved. The characters are well defined and the setting is utilised to its full potential. Only 13 episodes were made but managed to gain such a cult following, those 13 episodes were just enough to keep the likes of Basil Fawlty a household name for over 30 years. Only the likes of Del Boy and Rodney have gained such a heightened level of comedic status.

The story is simple, Fawlty Towers is a hotel owned and managed by Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) and his wife sybil (Prunella Scales). Basil is supported by his hotel cleaner and waitress Polly (Connie Booth) and his bellboy and waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs). The cast blend together brilliantly and have given us some of the funniest TV moments we're ever likely to see in our lifetime. Basil is the typical stressed out middle aged man, he goes on by letting lifes little troubles ware him down. He constantly tries to be the man about the hotel but constantly has his masculinity taken away from him by the scorn of Sybil.

John Cleese has always been a man I've considered as one of my idols, and this sitcom is the reason behind that. The comedy may be very slapstick, politically incorrect and at times very childish. I can't explain it but it all just seems to work in a way that will have you in fits of laughter no matter how many times you watch. The character of Basil is shockingly brilliant, I don't think anyone else could have played the character to such a level like John Cleese has. He is over the top, slick, stupid and physically funny. One of the best episodes that shows Cleese's physical prowess when playing this role is the infamous episode ""The Germans"" which spawned the line ""Don't mention the war."" The Hitler impression is something to be witnessed and regardless of whether you find things like that offensive or not, you just have to laugh.

Basil Fawlty is everything we find funny about people who lose their temper. He has his moments of trying to hide such terrible situations from his wife, but because of those attempts at hiding the problems he only manages to make them worse. The best example of this is when Sybil wants some building work done on the hotel, she wants to use a well respected but expensive builder. He wants to have a friend to do it on the cheap but he is anything but respectful. While Sybil is away for a weekend, Basil goes against her wishes and has his friend do it with disastrous consequences. What follows is a hysterical attempt at hiding the tragic building work from his wife by trying to keep her out of the hotel.

It's a fantastic series and I could honestly go on talking about it forever. I have nothing but good things to say about every cast member and their respective characters.

Most of the scrapes he gets himself into would be easily taken care of if he could simply tell the truth. But that concept is foreign to him.

This series ran the perfect amount of time, ending while it was still hilarious. Each episode is a unique story, never retreading old ground. If you are a fan of the British use of both irony and farce, this is a virtual treasure trove of humor.",1214956800,,567,4.299065420560748

Every episode is composed of a number of story lines; each wrapping around the others. John Cleese said that he and Connie Booth would lay out a long roll of paper and write ideas across the length of it interweaving the ideas so that they all came together at the end into a very funny episode. The various characters are well crafted and each is at least a little insane. Cleese is a great physical actor (watch ""The Germans"" and ""The Kipper and the Corpse"").  I love David Kelley (Mr. O'Riley, the builder). He is a great character (you saw him in ""Waking Ned Devine""). If you like great comedy, British or not, get this collection.

484851,5,6302541743,"In this spectacular BritCom, Monty Python's John Cleese stars as a disgruntled hotel owner named Basil Fawlty.  He cowrote the show with then-wife Connie Booth, who plays the maid, Polly Sherman.  Cleese and Booth divorced after Season 1, and it took a while 'til they could work together again to write and star in Season 2.  After that, they could not work together anymore, and it's a real shame that only 2 seasons of this brilliant comedy was ever made.  Prunella Scales plays Fawlty's wife, Sybill, a bit of a shrew who always has more important things to do than helping to run the hotel.  And Andrew Sachs plays the mousy Spanish bellhop, Manuel, who tries to be a good employee, but his efforts are hampered by the fact that he doesn't speak English.  Basil is short-tempered, rude to the guests, trying to raise the hotel's standards while remaining cheap and overall, unpleasant.  Guests range from brazen French women, obnoxious Americans, people who think their dogs are people, senile retired Army Majors, confidence tricksters, old ladies who complain about everything but refuse to turn on their hearing aids, and people who have the nerve to die in bed overnight.  Also they have to deal with hotel inspectors, drunken gay gourmet chefs, snobs, incompetent builders/construction workers and the health department...not to mention a psychiatrist, and even Germans!  Every episode is a classic!  This is truly one of the best and funniest sitcoms ever made anywhere on the planet!

484967,5,6302541743,"Fawlty Towers is still the funniest series ever produced.  The cast was perfect, the scripts crisp, action-packed and hilarious, and the situations were totally believable. John Cleese is a master of physical and verbal comedy, with the remarkable goose-step, the thrashing of the mini, the manhandling of Manuel, the spasmodic jerks and jumps - one can go on and on.  The rest of the cast is perfect and fantastics, but Cleese is the pivotal character in the mix.  His unctious, obsequiousness to those perceived to be in the upper class and drop-dead rudeness to everyone else is one of key elements of action at Fawlty Towers.

There was an attempt to translate the series to the US in a version starring Diana Rigg.  This series followed in the steps of several other British series with less than likeable main characters coming to the US with great success (Sanford & Son, All in the Family).  The series lasted through several episodes which were straight re-writes of the original.  The move from male to female lead did not work, and the emphasis on class differences necessary to the British version did not play in the States.

I am not going to list the episodes or heap masses of praise - others have done that.  I am going to tell you about my favorite episode - the Anniversary Party - where the normally obnoxious Basil tries to plan a surprise party for his wife, gets her so mad at him by pretending to have forgotten the event that she leaves, forcing him to resort to a small lie to placate the arriving guests.  This lie balloons with each arrival, until Basil is forced to hire Polly, the maid, to impersonate his wife.  In this episode you actually wind up feeling sorry for Basil, who, though hoist by his own petard, is doing what he thinks is best for good reasons with very bad results.

The episodes in this series are so tightly written that several of them actually seem like two separate episodes in terms of action (the concussion/fire alarm is a prime example).

This series is the best ever made.  It can be watched again and again and again.  If you have not discovered the joys of Fawlty Towers and its dysfunctional staff, rush out an rent or buy.",1202428800,,2184,4.607235142118863

It's too bad that BBC only made 12 episodes.  This could've been as great and well known as Monty Python had it continued for a few more years.

I don't think there could've been any TV series more satisfying that Fawlty Towers.  After rewatching these episodes over and over, I still marvel at their story structure and the brilliant comedic situations they managed to come up with.  My personal favorites are 'Communications Problems' and 'The Psychiatrist'.  In addition to the brilliance of John Cleese, the casting of the supportive players was pure genius.

Caught lots more than I did in the past, probably due to increased life experience pointing up the principles involved in most work environments. Unless one is put off/confused by the series's Britishisms, this will function as classic comedy descended from the likes of The Honeymooners, Laurel & Hardy, & even Wodehouse. It's some of the funniest stuff I've ever seen, with something for everyone but anyone who might be offended by the treatment of the Manuel character, but hilarity tends to override such concerns. Potential demonstrated by Cleese in Monty Python comes to delightfully manic fruition. Cleese is often given a run for his money by Prunella Scales's deliciously pretentious, instantly recognizable character, embodying everything comforting, annoying, and amusing in what might in America be called the ""upper working class.""

485095,5,6302541743,"Very little of what has ever been on TV can accurately be called essential viewing, but this brief but magnificent series is surely one of them. For those who have never witnessed an episode of ""Fawlty Towers,"" you will want to forget most of what you thought you knew about John Cleese from his immortal Python days. Certainly all of the physical comedy is intact, as well as Cleese's love of humor derived from the fertile fields of embarrassment and miscommunication. But in ""Fawlty Towers"" all of Cleese's best instincts as both a comedian and a humorist are refined by orders of magnitude, and more prominently on display than they ever could have been in the crowded Python collaboration.

This is screamingly funny stuff. But even more importantly, the material resonates deeply on a human level. Basil Fawlty may be the rudest, most obnoxious, impatient, pigheaded and vein individual ever portrayed on the tiny screen -- but if we don't see just a little bit of our own vanities and foibles in Basil, then we're probably not being entirely honest with ourselves. Much of the astonishing intensity of the humor in ""Fawlty Towers"" springs from the little voice inside our heads that says, ""There but for the grace of God go I.""

To Cleese's great credit, he hold Basil up more for examination than ridicule. Although clearly Basil is his own worst enemy, and while we could not possible feel any real warmth toward him, we nevertheless sympathize with his plight. This sharpness of observation is why ""Fawlty Towers"" is more than just a funny TV series, and why it soars to very special and rare heights. Simply said, this series is a work of genuine comic genius.

As far as the DVD set is concerned, American viewers have to be continually disappointed with the decision of BBC Warner to release British TV shows on DVD in the US 4:3 (1.33:1) format instead of their original PAL screen ratio. In that sense, American viewers have never actually seen the complete ""Fawlty Towers."" What a shame, and how completely unnecessary.

A few very mild swear words are sprinkled about, not terrible ones, but not for the easily offended or young.

The warning I would add is that the old Major is very, very politically incorrect, and was even for his time.  I think the writers meant for us to be jolted by his language, and weren't condoning his racisim.  I'd watched this series over and over on PBS where the offending remarks had been deleted out, and never missed.",1184630400,,648,4.411764705882353
485173,4,6302541743,"Kevin Murphy of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (another show all comedy fans should own on DVD) said it best once when he referred to Fawlty Towers as the ""greatest sitcom"" ever. I simply cannot say enough good things about the show. Even after repeated viewings over many years it is amazingly funny; no surprise there, Cleese and Booth crafted each script for six weeks till the comedy was honed to a razor edge. By limiting themselves to just six shows per series and spacing the two series a few years apart, they were able to spend enough time on each script to ensure that there were no wasted lines or filler, it's pure comedy from start to finish. Nearly every moment of the show is used as an opportunity to generate laughter.

The extras on this DVD set are also worth viewing. They include a concise, informative interview with John Cleese, a brief bit about the fate of the building used as Fawlty Towers in the show, a documentary on the Gleneagles Hotel in England which inspired the show, and more.

My only complaint about this DVD set and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the picture quality. The picture quality is simply inexcusable for DVD. It is grainy and fuzzy in many spots and there are even some color anomalies that pop up occasionally. A show of this caliber certainly deserves better, especially on a medium that can provide terrific picture quality. My old VHS copy of the show had a better picture quality. The DVD at times looks degraded in a way similar to a VHS tape that has been watched hundreds of times.

Picture quality notwithstanding, any comedy fan, especially those who appreciate off-beat comedy like Monty Python's Flying Circus, Black Adder, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Red Dwarf, etc. will LOVE Fawlty Towers. In spite of the picture quality, you will enjoy this immensely.",1184630400,3,1831,4.697819314641745

485176,4,6302541743,"There is indeed nothing faulty with Fawlty Towers.
This Britcom which was first filmed in 1975 then added to later in 1979 is an enduring classic of its genre and is definitely one of the all time best....period.
It's star John Cleese along with then-wife and co-star(Polly)Connie Booth collaborated on the entire series together. Most of the series was filmed in studio but there were quite a few exterior shots and they used the Wooburn Grange Country Club in Torquay,England for that purpose. The club itself has since burned down and been bulldozed to make way for residential development.
However Cleeses' actual inspiration for the character of Basil Fawlty comes from one Mr. Sinclair(now deceased) the o/o of the GlenEagles Hotel in Torquay. It seems Cleese and some of the Monty Python cast and crew were staying at the GlenEagles and experienced some of Mr. Sinclair's,shall we say,""inestimable charm"" first hand. Most of the group was not amused and off most trotted to a nearby and more forgiving establishment for the duration of their stay there. Cleese however was intrigued by the utter gall,bluster and plain rudeness of Mr. Sinclair and thought he would stay to observe this local phenom up close and personal. From that experience sprang forth the idea for Basil Fawlty and the rest is sitcom history.
Fawlty Towers has created a minor tourism point of call for the GlenEagles Hotel in Torquay and the surrounding area .Buses and folks from all over the world come there to have a glimpse of the famous hotel which inspried this wonderful show. Depending on who one talks to the oppinions of locals range from happy to embarassed but very rarely negative. And this is quite a testament to just a 12 episode Britcom which during its' first airing in 1975 didn't get much attention at all. It wasn't until its' re-runs the following years that the groundswell gathered steam which eventually prompted more eps to be filmed in 1979. When you look at them today it is almost nigh impossible to tell where the /75-ers start and the /79-ers end. Again another indication of the over all quality of the show from top to bottom.
Technically speaking this show has been transferred very well from tape. The contrast and colours have been cleaned up and it looks better than it ever did.
The three discs included with this set(not four as indicated above by one of the product reviewers)comes with interviews with Cleese,Sachs(Manuel) and Scales(Mrs. Fawlty),trips to Torquay,out takes,directors commentaries and more.
The reason I'm not giving this higher stars is because of the lack of any inserts with episode information. There is an extremely lean blurb for each ep on the back cover of the set but that's it. One assumes also that the eps listed are in order but it would have been nice to have at least release dates but sadly there are none. I think for the price BBC video could have plumped this set up a bit.
In conclusion except for the minor drawbacks listed this set generally is worth getting for any fan of good comedy sitcoms and /or Britcoms. It's humour and characters are universally indentifiable and work on many levels. It is still fast paced(in large part due to its' judicious editing) and plain laugh out loud funny.

My favorite episode is ""The Builders.""  The one part that leave my sides hurting from laughing so hard is the one where Sybil Fawlty comes back to find that O'Reilly's workmen have screwed up yet again (this after already hiring a competent, yet expensive, contractor to do the work).  Mr. O'Reilly claims that he, ""...likes a woman with spirit,"" to which Sybil responds with, ""Oh, do you?  Is that what you like?""  Mr. O'Reilly assures her, enthusiastically responding, ""I do! I do!"" Sybil: ""Oh good.""  She then proceeds to whack her husband in the stomach with an umbrella and then starts beating the living daylights out of O'Reilly while she says, ""Come on, then, give us a smile.""  With O'Reilly crouched against the check-in desk Sybil proclaims: ""I've seen better creatures than you lying on their backs at the bottom of ponds.""

Check out the episodes ""Communications Problems"" and ""The Corpse and the Kippers"" for some of the most brilliant comedic acting and writing that you are likely to ever come across.

John Cleese portrays the cheap and incompetent hotel owner Basil Fawlty, Andrew Sachs is the perpetually hounded and bumbling waiter Manuel (""He's from Barcelona""), Prunella Scales plays Basil's bossy wife Sybil (Basil's  ""little nest of vipers"") , and Connie Booth plays the most competent character of the bunch but who is forever getting swept up into Basil's tangled schemes. The cast is outstanding and the writing is pure genius.

485282,5,6302541743,"This is a fantastic series that earns the accolades in the other reviews.  John Cleese's situation comedy only ran for two seasons for a total of 12 episodes, but it is clear that the Monty Python alumnus crafted these shows with a special care.

The result is a series that gets funnier as it progresses.  Cleese is ""Basil Fawlty"" our (anti-)hero, the misanthropic owner/manager of the hotel referred to in the title.  The episodes demonstrate his frentic attempts at either trying to increase the social standing of his establishment, or alternatively, just keep it running.  In these attempts, he confronts many formidable and/or obnoxious characters (the best of which would come down to either his own wife or the hard-of-hearing Mrs. Richards).  Too cowardly to confront these characters, Basil channels his frustrations to the innocent or harmless...usually his own incompetent bellboy.

What really distinguishes this series is the timing and editing.  There are websites devoted to the structure of these programs and how the plot develops.  Watching any episode, you can feel the tension building as Basil's latest crisis escalates beyond his abilities.  By the tme you get to the final minutes, you are laughing as a release as much as a reaction to the antics.

It's not perfect--some characters never really click (the Major), and its not a very polished production (some lines are inaudible).  All in all though this is one of the few television series worth owning.

Fawlty Towers is a comedy series about man and wife who run a self-named hotel. The hotel seems nice enough, though in need of a few repairs. They have a staff of two- a man from Barcelona who speaks very little English and a young blond woman whose beauty is what is attracts the most attention. John Cleese as Basil Fawlty is the main character and it's his sarcastic humor, his immense groveling and his pie-in-the-face antics that define the comedy of this series. It's British, it's backwards, and it has made me laugh because it's so basic.

But then again, it's not all clean humor. There are sexual references and innuendo that make me squirm watching it with my young ones (the wedding party). It does, also, cross the line into peeking and groping, though for seemingly innocent reasons (the psychiatrist). Our kids are not allowed to watch an episode that we haven't screened. After watching this first episode listed above, we waited 6 weeks (after the Christmas season) to screen anymore. Last night, we screened two, one of them being the latter listed above.

I find the sexual humor offensive. As a teen, I laughed while watching, but had nightmares afterwards. That was in the days before taping where shows weren't pre-screened and offensive material couldn't be skipped through the magic of fast forward or scene selection.

My recommendation is to watch with a friend who knows which episodes to avoid, if you can find such a friend. And then screen, screen, screen before allowing the kids to watch. Some of it will be over their heads, but watch out, because some memories will stick with them long after Fawlty Towers has been closed for repairs.",1168387200,7,1781,4.698717948717949
485408,5,6302541743,"Too bad John Cleese and Connie Booth only wrote & produced 12 episodes, but re-playing them every once in a while will still provide enough laughs to cheer anyone up.

Anyone, that is, who likes to see the old-fashioned Britisher's penchant for public politeness and starchy protocol (no-matter-what the situation) get muddled and overcome by the practicalities of everyday life and the evolving (at the time) impatience with the stiff-upper-lip facade of British society -- a facade that began crumbling with the advent of Monty Python.  If you like watching how the Brits learned to poke fun at themselves in publicly-aired media, this one's for you.

Most episodes have that Monty Pythonian touch where over-exaggeration of a situation provides quite a bit of the humor, but the dialogs in Fawlty Towers are generally more witty and less slapstick than most of the Monty Python movies or TV skits I've seen.  An exception was the ""Waldorf Salad"" episode where the situation was exaggerated to an extreme that was too implausible to be funny, but even that episode has numerous punch lines that will evoke hearty laughter when regurgitated to those familiar with this outstanding series of 12.",1168300800,,1195,5.081632653061225

I saw this series first on American PBS in 1982 and was struck by the brilliant writing, physical acting and clever dynamic of the cast.  At the time America only turned out sitcoms filled with dull jokes, tepid characters, heavily inflated laugh tracks, or the Fonz striking poses as the crowd wailed mercilessly in rapture.  Stale.  Amazingly, classmates of mine in high school at the time claimed it was boring and couldn't understand the plots.  And they were never heard of again.

This 70's BBC series is classic, and a must have for any comedy lover.  Dated, but it has its place.  Much of the writing and comedic action is still leaps ahead of modern fare, despite being one of the cheapest series produced at the time by the BBC (in 1974).

Shows are uncut and unadulterated.  No special correction or computer fixes to small imperfections.  Thank god.  It is a very classy and straight forward package.  Mr. Davies and Mr. Spiers provide commentary tracks which are nearly to sleep by.  Davies is mostly quiet, and his gurgling stomach is constantly providing commentary while Spiers is heard endlessly drinking, smoking or exercising Restless Leg Syndrome.  And it sounds like it was shot in someone's spare bedroom.  Still good for a one time listen by fans of the series, but not worth it if you just like the shows and don't care about where cameras were position, or how long make up took.",1168128000,,1572,4.658181818181818

With over 237 reviews of this 4 disc DVD set here on Amazon.com, I don't think I need to expand on the merits of each episode; nonetheless, Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) is such a pathetic but amusing character you cannot help laughing at. Supporting cast including Prunella Scales and Connie Booth (who co-wrote the series) are, of course, are the perfect comedic foil to our beleaguered and boorish host. Other supporting characters are also superb.

Overall, this is a very nicely done set with additional footage and interviews from some of the cast as well as a short documentary on the actual hotel (unfortunately destroyed in a fire) in Torquay, England, where the series was filmed outside of the studio.

While ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" may be a little off-the-wall or hard to take for some audiences, ""Fawlty Towers"" is the perfect antidote to the typical American situation comedy.

Although not of a sophisticated or urbane wit or satire as say, ""Yes, Minister,"" with Nigel Hawthorne and Paul Eddington, ""Fawlty Towers"" does offer the viewer a lens into the comedic slapstick genius of John Cleese and some truly exceptional writing for a 30 minute program.",1153094400,,1340,4.96875

The supporting characters, like Manuel (Andrew Sachs) who barely speaks English, Basil's wife Sybil (Prunella Scales) and Polly  the maid (Connie Booth, who shares screenwriting credit with Cleese) are all perfect as their respective characters, serving more as a counterpoint to Cleese's madness.

485643,5,6302541743,"Come visit the worst-run hotel in the whole of western Europe (well, except for that place in Eastbourne...)

In a field with many top contenders, 'Fawlty Towers' remains my favourite of all 'Britcoms' - situation comedies originating on British television. Fawlty Towers has a cult following decades after the originals aired; it is sometimes hard to believe that there are but 12 episodes, six hours total. The regular cast is led by John Cleese, veteran of the famous Monty Python comedy troupe, as the irrepressible Basil Fawlty, titular head of the hotel with dreams of class and glory; Prunella Scales is his long-suffering and hardworking wife, Sybil, who recognises that while Basil may think 'the sky's the limit!', in fact, '22 rooms is the limit'. Connie Booth (Cleese's real-life wife) played the level-headed and sensible, overworked maid Polly, and in a role matched only by Fawlty's own bizarre manner, Andrew Sachs plays the loveable and ever-incompetent Spanish waiter, Manuel (he's from Barcelona...).  Ballard Berkeley makes Ballard Berkeley makes a regular appearance as the Major, a retired long-term resident at the hotel. Brian Hall joined the cast for the second season as the not-quite-gourmet chef, Terry.

From the very first episode (first aired in 1975) featured a social-climbing Fawlty as perhaps the most rude and insufferable hotel manager in existence, in the resort town of Torquay, on the Channel coast of Britain. Sybil tries to maintain a reasonable level of service, but Fawlty's snobbishness permits him to be gracious (indeed, excessively fawning) toward those he considers 'worthy', which in this episode turns out to be Lord Melbury, who ends up not being Lord Melbury, but rather a confidence trickster, and Fawlty's revenge scares away the real 'posh' guests, whom Fawlty sends off with the hilarious shout, 'Snobs!'

In each of the episodes, there is a crisis - one gets the sense that the life of Fawlty is non-stop crisis, with his wife and Polly forever picking up the pieces, Manuel always complicating things, and the others wandering around in a state of disbelief (or, in the case of the Major, perpetual daze). The twelve episodes highlight all the things that could wrong at hotel in classic comedic fashion - the institution of a Gourmet Night falls flat when the not-quite-recovering alcoholic chef starts drinking the night of the main event; a guest dies in the middle of the night, and Fawlty tries to slip him out unnoticed; remodelers install and remove the wrong doors; the health inspector unexpected shows up and gets served a bit of rat with his cheese.

However, nothing quite matches the kinds of situations Basil can get himself into. When trying to plan a surprise anniversary dinner for his wife, she leaves the hotel thinking that Basil has forgotten again, and Basil dresses Polly up as a sick-bed-bound Sybil to fool the guests. When Polly's friends check in for a wedding over the weekend, Basil suspects the group of free sexual expression (highlighting his own repression); this theme is carried over to a glorious extreme in the episode about the visiting Psychiatrist.

'How does he make his living?' Basil protests. 'He makes his money by sticking his nose into others' private parts, er, details...'

This is also the episode where Sybil finally confronts Basil about his double-sided hotel manner toward guests: 'You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder,' she declares. He replies in perfect form, 'Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.'

As the psychiatrist will comment near the end, there's enough material for an entire psychiatrist conference. Indeed there is, as this is slapstick humour with a difference. Intelligent and witty while utterly chaotic and beyond the pale, one is treated to the moose-head incident and the ingrowing toenail as well as Fawlty's unique form of automobile motivation (how many of us have ever been tempted to whack away at a stalled car with a stick!) and a nice performance of Brahms (his 'third racket', to be precise). One must not overlook the little details, either, including the ever-changing sign in front (the actual hotel used for the exteriors unfortunately burned down many years after the show), and the fact that the interior and exterior layouts of the building cannot correspond (shades of 'The Simpsons' whose furniture layout changes from scene to scene).

It is almost inconceivable that the two series, each of six episodes, were four years apart (1975 and 1979), as they flow rather seamlessly together. Popular on television networks worldwide, it can be seen variously on BBC America and local public television channels, often during the fund drives, when the most popular pieces are shown.

The DVD has various extras, including interviews with Cleese, Scales and Sachs (Booth was not available); there are director's commentaries as well as a tour of the now-abandoned hotel used for the exterior (a rather bizarre piece, that). The extras are sadly substandard, but the series itself is excellent, and worth having in the digital format.",1133654400,9,5156,5.134684147794994

That alone is a satisfying banquet that you will want to repeat over and over, wiithout going further to sample the rest. Having finally done that, it's difficult to pick a favorite episode, and it's arguable that any single one in the collection is, alone, worth the price of the whole.

In the first episode alone, we're treated to some brilliant, classic (and nearly indescribable) situations: ""On Those Trays (Burro! Hee-haw!)"" and ""Throw - It - AWAY!"" (It's difficult to write this, without cracking up.) The slapstick is tastefully done. I don't know if it's true or not, but it gives the impression of being cleverly improvised on the spot, rather than slickly planned and rehearsed. Cleese and Company should be very proud indeed.

485755,5,6302541743,"The real prize element of this collection is that it shows Cleese's side of the MONTY PYTHON team, as well as being a great show piece for  Connie Booth's writing skills. It is very evident that this body of work is culturally specific in it's overall sense of humour: Whilst it is clear that US audiences enjoy the series( and some most definitely do not), the things that are liked are different to the way a British audience will perceive the series.

There are three  seasons in this collection, not the two as usually stated. Three seasons, three discs...

The writing is incredibly precise. You can see this in the published versions of the scripts. In this respect, it has the same skilled basis for good performers as the Python Material. But where the Python team did not know where to stop, Cleese and Booth decided to leave it at three seasons, and so whilst there is a demand there for more of this material, Cleese and Booth wanted to leave on a high note.

It's incredibly hard to give a precise of each show, since the writers blocked out the story flows on charts over 6 week  periods, and basically agonized  over every word. These shows were done with an eye for precision, and in this respect they were an extension of the Python  process for writing, since each show ( FAWLTY TOWERS as well as seasons 1-3 of MONTY PYTHON) is an example of detailed work.

All this adds up to a body of work that stands up to repeated viewing, and has a degree of universality ( like YES MINISTER, and  YES  PRIME MINISTER, but the YES... MINISTER  series are much more  Universal). And I suspect that the writers and producers never expected this series to have the longevity it has attained ( Much the same way that Ben Elton has stated that THE YOUNG ONES is very clearly  dated, since it was targeted for specific  times and specific  events); however, FAWLTY TOWERS looks at some Universal  elements in life, and in  British  experience.

Undoubtedly, FAWLTY TOWERS is perennial, but it is mainly perennial for the British  experience; a US  audience will like it to some degree, but the appeal is fundamentally  different. It is not that it is less, just different.

All that Being said, I can recommend this collection as being a great body of work. As an example of low budget British TV comedy that has at its heart a Superb script, one can but hope that TV in general, in all places, irrespective of the budget, will look to great scripts, and let the story telling be augmented by great performers ( such as Cleese), each to their own milieu ( Cultural, or whatever), or even if aimed at a world audience. Key to the understanding of the cultural  specificity, is how Manuel changes from being Spanish in the original  series, and then in the Spanish, he is Italian, and in each different language dub, the Archetype selected for Manuel changes  according to how each dub version will select a different nationality to be the butt of the jokes... and the way these jokes are translated tell more about the culture they are being reworked into than they do about the original  version of the show.

At once a very simple show, but it can be seen on many levels; however, if you don't get it, if you don't find the shows funny, remember that these ARE shows done for a particular Milieu; a better example of more Universal comedy from the BBC, is something like YES MINISTER ( not to say that this higher budget work is better, simply different).",1109116800,12,3458,4.550161812297735

Some of the episodes are just as funny today as they were 25+ years ago.  If it wasn't for some vet bills right now, I'd probably run out and get these on DVD for the better quality and the hope of some good extras.

What makes Fawlty Tower's work is Basil's arrogance, his fear/contempt/love of his wife, and his ability to always do the wrong thing even when he is trying to do the right thing.  My favorite episode is the one where the guy sneaks the girl into his room.  The image of Basil tapping on the glass as if he is inspecting it is pure comic genius.

I was sorely disappointed with the American version a few years ago with John Laroquette.  They tried to portray the Fawlty's marriage as being loving, where is the fun in that?  The remake lacked any of the edginess of the original.

As a big ""Monty Python"" fan, I was totally unprepared for the more sophisticated humor in ""Fawlty Towers"". John Cleese as Basil Fawlty, the proprietor of a somewhat dodgy inn, is as over the top in this series as he ever was. Fans of Cleese's contributions to Python won't be disappointed.

Basil is rude, incompetent and extremely condescending. He consistently attempts to bully his patrons into following his own schedule, adapting to his own mannerisms and submitting to his will in general. Unfortunately for Basil, most of the patrons staying at the inn refuse to conform, and rightly so. The end result usually involves Basil being disgraced, humiliated and deflated.

Basil's wife Sybil, played by Prunella Scales, is bossy, lazy and ineffective. Half of Sybil's life seems dedicated to barking orders to her husband, the other half to talking on the phone, chatting with customers or eating bon-bons.

Polly, the maid/waitress, serves as Basil's partner in crime. When things go wrong, and they always do, it becomes Polly's job to help hide the evidence, usually from Sybil.

Manuel is from Barcelona.

Each episode of ""Fawlty Towers"" is truly a comedy of errors, the moral of which (if one needs a moral) might be: ""Don't be like Basil."" As things snowball out of control, Basil's and Polly's attempts to get a handle on the situation (usually while keeping everything from Sybil) result in some of the best comedic moments in television history.

Each episode of the series is completely unique and may be watched separately; it doesn't take long to catch on to the characters and how they interact. Additionally, Cleese and Booth  put their unique stamp on the script, with lines just as quotable as anything from ""Monty Python"" or ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".

Because there are only 12 episodes total, the writing, the acting and the laughs stay top notch throughout. This isn't a collection one buys to get a couple of favorite episodes. The extras on the DVD mirror the series by being just right. Some commentary, some interviews, a couple of sidepieces, and that's it. No Hollywood flash, just things that will interest any fan of the series.

One of the things I liked best about ""Fawlty Towers"" when watching it years ago, was that I could watch it with my Dad. The humor isn't universal.

Fawlty Towers is funny for more than one reason.  Generally, British sitcoms are not as rigid as American sitcoms.  Then there is the language itself.  Pronounciations and accents make things sound even funnier.  I would imagine that you've never called your wife a ""stupid cloth eared beet"" before.  John Cleese is simply mad.  He's very tall and the sight of him doing his slapstick physical comedy is hilarious.

You can usually see Fawlty Towers and all the other ""Britcoms"" on PBS but they go through periods where they remove certain shows from the air from time to time.  You may remember John Cleese from his younger days with Monty Python's Flying Circus, which I didn't watch for years because I thought it was a circus show.  What a fool was I.

Here are some of my favorites that you simply must see:

The Corpse and the Kipper - A guest dies during the night but when Basil Fawlty brings his breafast in the morning he doesn't even notice the guy is dead!

The Health Inspector - The Health Inspector comes to perform a suprise inspection.  Little does Basil know that Manuel has a pet rat that gets loose in the hotel.  Manuel thinks it's a hamster.  Everyone tries to catch the rat while keeping it hush-hush from the inspector.  This episode is wild.

The Germans - Basil Fawlty's done himself a mischief and gotten a concusion.  He leaves the hospital insisting that he's okay because the Germans are coming and he must be there.  Add that to the fact that he can't speak German and watch the fun.

Gourmet Night - Basil tries to cater to the upper crust of British Society by offering a Gourmet Night at the hotel.  It doesn't go well.  The chef (a male) gets drunk and falls in love with Manuel.  There's no dinner to serve and Basil orders it from another restaurant.  He has to pick it up but he gets stuck because the car that he tried to fix himself stops running.  He threatens the car but when that doesn't work, he decides to beat the car with a switch!  When he finally gets back his dinner is not quite what he expected.

The Anniversary - Basil and his wife have a bit of a row (fight) and she leaves just when he's all set to suprise her with a party.  He decides to have the maid pretend that she is his wife.  I can't even explain the rest.  It's too nuts!

485763,5,6302541743,"If you were to look up some of the most hysterical moments on the BBC, you would no doubtably come across two names.  Those names would be John Cleese and Ricky Gervais.  While Gervais recently found comedy through his program called ""The Office"", Cleese has been providing wit, wisdom, and down-right hysteria for the past several decades.  While away from his namesake (Monty Python), you can find Cleese comfortable in several other roles that showcase his bubbling talent.  One of those programs just happens to be the funniest bit of crumpet called ""Fawlty Towers"".

Remembering this show when I was a child and was on our local PBS station, I eagerly bought it when it was released on DVD about a year ago.  Since then, I have watched random episodes here and there but never fully taking in the enjoyment from watching it all.  So, today I decided to sit down and watch this series from beginning to end and I have yet to finish laughing.  If this program doesn't define comic genius, I don't know what does.  Never have I witnessed a show that has continually been fresh, hysterical (I cannot use that word enough), real, and outlandish all at the same time.  Normally, with our current television programming, you need to pick or choose which it will be, but thankfully ""Fawlty Towers"" is all of these and many more.

Cleese remains in top form as Basil Fawlty, the owner/manager of the B&B that just happens to have his hands and over-worked imagination in everything.  With the aid of his helpers Manuel (he's from Barcelona) and Polly (co-writer Connie Booth and ex-wife of Cleese), Cleese always seems to find himself in a heap of trouble with his wife Sybil (the dragon of the hotel).  Armed with physical humor and a snake-like banter, we witness everything from a dead body, hotel inspectors, a failed anniversary party, a moose head, and a Himalayan rodent of sorts happen to this simple, everyday, B&B.  This is not only a few of the episodes you will find in the complete set, but also the daily stress that Basil finds himself falling into daily.

This series, again, is hysterical.  Cleese is the master of his trade while proving that he can manage any task thrown in front of him.  While some will argue that he overshadows the rest of the cast, I would say ""hogwash"" to that.  My two favorite characters in this series were Major and Manuel.  The comedy that they provide cannot be found on television today.  All I need to say is thank God for the BBC.

The episodes are all delightful little gems, Basil attempting to 'thrash' a car into submission, pull one over on Sybil (or a hotel inspector) or catch a con artist (or a rat) are all hilarious.

In a field with many top contenders, 'Fawlty Towers' remains my favourite of all 'Britcoms' - situation comedies originating on British television.  Fawlty Towers has a cult following decades after the originals aired; it is sometimes hard to believe that there are but 12 episodes, six hours total.  The regular cast is led by John Cleese, veteran of the famous Monty Python comedy troupe, as the irrepressible Basil Fawlty, titular head of the hotel with dreams of class and glory; Prunella Scales is his long-suffering and hardworking wife, Sybil, who recognises that while Basil may think 'the sky's the limit!', in fact, '22 rooms is the limit'.  Connie Booth (Cleese's real-life wife) played the level-headed and sensible, overworked maid Polly, and in a role matched only by Fawlty's own bizarre manner, Andrew Sachs plays the loveable and ever-incompetent Spanish waiter, Manuel (he's from Barcelona...).  Ballard Berkeley makes a regular appearance as the Major, a retired long-term resident at the hotel.  Brian Hall joined the cast for the second season as the not-quite-gourmet chef, Terry.

From the very first episode (first aired in 1975) featured a social-climbing Fawlty as perhaps the most rude and insufferable hotel manager in existence, in the resort town of Torquay, on the Channel coast of Britain.  Sybil tries to maintain a reasonable level of service, but Fawlty's snobbishness permits him to be gracious (indeed, excessively fawning) toward those he considers 'worthy', which in this episode turns out to be Lord Melbury, who ends up not being Lord Melbury, but rather a confidence trickster, and Fawlty's revenge scares away the real 'posh' guests, whom Fawlty sends off with the hilarious shout, 'Snobs!'

In each of the episodes, there is a crisis - one gets the sense that the life of Fawlty is non-stop crisis, with his wife and Polly forever picking up the pieces, Manuel always complicating things, and the others wandering around in a state of disbelief (or, in the case of the Major, perpetual daze).  The twelve episodes highlight all the things that could wrong at hotel in classic comedic fashion - the institution of a Gourmet Night falls flat when the not-quite-recovering alcoholic chef starts drinking the night of the main event; a guest dies in the middle of the night, and Fawlty tries to slip him out unnoticed; remodelers install and remove the wrong doors; the health inspector unexpected shows up and gets served a bit of rat with his cheese.

However, nothing quite matches the kinds of situations Basil can get himself into.  When trying to plan a surprise anniversary dinner for his wife, she leaves the hotel thinking that Basil has forgotten again, and Basil dresses Polly up as a sick-bed-bound Sybil to fool the guests.  When Polly's friends check in for a wedding over the weekend, Basil suspects the group of free sexual expression (highlighting his own repression); this theme is carried over to a glorious extreme in the episode about the visiting Psychiatrist.

'How does he make his living?' Basil protests.  'He makes his money by sticking his nose into others' private parts, er, details...'

This is also the episode where Sybil finally confronts Basil about his double-sided hotel manner toward guests: 'You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder,' she declares.  He replies in perfect form, 'Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.'

As the psychiatrist will comment near the end, there's enough material for an entire psychiatrist conference.  Indeed there is, as this is slapstick humour with a difference.  Intelligent and witty while utterly chaotic and beyond the pale, one is treated to the moose-head incident and the ingrowing toenail as well as Fawlty's unique form of automobile motivation (how many of us have ever been tempted to whack away at a stalled car with a stick!) and a nice performance of Brahms (his 'third racket', to be precise).  One must not overlook the little details, either, including the ever-changing sign in front (the actual hotel used for the exteriors unfortunately burned down many years after the show), and the fact that the interior and exterior layouts of the building cannot correspond (shades of 'The Simpsons' whose furniture layout changes from scene to scene).

It is almost inconceivable that the two series, each of six episodes, were four years apart (1975 and 1979), as they flow rather seamlessly together.  Popular on television networks worldwide, it can be seen variously on BBC America and local public television channels, often during the fund drives, when the most popular pieces are shown.

The DVD has various extras, including interviews with Cleese, Scales and Sachs (Booth was not available); there are director's commentaries as well as a tour of the now-abandoned hotel used for the exterior (a rather bizarre piece, that).  The extras are sadly substandard, but the series itself is excellent, and worth having in the digital format.",1092787200,7,5148,5.1291866028708135
485805,5,6302541743,"Fawlty Towers is, in my opinion, one of the greatest Britcoms of all time. It is one of my favorite shows, and if you choose to watch it, it might go near the top of your list too. John Cleese plays the role of Basil Fawlty to perfection, a rude, and very stressed hotel owner. I believe that no other person could ever have played Basil Fawlty nearly as well as John Cleese.
Basil Fawlty is supposed to be a horrible person, but I'd say when it comes to how he treats the people who stay at his hotel, some of them are worse than he is. The child from Gourmet Night, the man from Waldorf Salad, and many others further prove this thought.
Anyway, Basil Fawlty runs the hotel with his sensible yet talkative wife Sybil (Prunela Scales), and one questions their marriage. Working at Fawlty Towers is the smart, quick-witted, artist Polly (Connie Booth), who is often dragged in to Basil's scams and such. Also working there is the hard working, yet extremely bad at English, Manuel (Andrew Sachs), a worker hired from Barcelona, as well as the chef Terry (season 2).
My personal favorite episode of this show is the hilarious The Germans, one of John Cleese's best performances in my opinion (""Don't mention the war! I mentioned it once, but I think I got away with it""). So please, do yourself a favor and buy this 3-disc set containing all twelve episodes of Fawlty Towers, and you can own some of the greatest half hours in the history of television.",1091318400,2,1452,4.503787878787879

After the first ""uno, dos, tres"" episode with Manuel, any other times Basil has a tough time communicating with Manuel, it just seems tired. There is no subtle humor because everything in the show is such an overtly over exaggeration. There is not an ounce of believability...

485910,5,6302541743,"Sitcoms in general give me hives. They often have the feeling of being thrown together at the last minute, or are typically filled with predictable, contrived, and unchallenging humor, or are simply hollow vehicles for advertising to help put viewers ""in the buying mood."" These trends seem to be evolving more in favor of the advertiser than the viewing public, so it's refreshing to see that something wonderful can be done with the sitcom medium.
Fawlty Towers is a meticulously written and acted British sitcom in which nearly every line and movement delivers a laugh. In the realm of the sitcom it has no equals, which also explains why only 12 episodes were produced. At the rate at which most sitcoms (British or North American)are shucked out it's just not possible to consistently crank out material of this quality. Each episode on these DVDs is the result of months of research, drafting, writing, rehearsing and editing. John Cleese was offered to do the series in the United States, but interest waned when Cleese told them how long each episode takes to produce. Sitcom producers generally don't have the patience for hardcore quality material.
The show is set in a British Hotel that is run by a racist snob (Basil Fawlty played by John Cleese) who, once he discovers that someone is a Lord or a Doctor or someone of ""importance"", he stops being rude to them and takes on a disgusting deference. This theme alone drives almost half of the episodes. Other episodes deal with racism (between the English, Germans, Indians, etc.), Basil's weakness for parsimony or gambling, health inspectors, removing a corpse from a hotel indiscreetly, and the classic misunderstanding.
For first time viewers of Fawlty Towers, if any of the humor seems stale it's likely because it's been badly imitated somewhere else. Don't blame Fawlty Towers for this. In many ways it set the standard (though never exceeded) for sitcoms after it. Entire series were built off of one idea presented in one episode of Fawlty Towers (i.e., the 'misunderstanding' in ""The Wedding Party"" was probably the entire inspiration for years of second-rate ""Three's Company"" episodes).
""The Germans"" is probably one of the best shows ever made, though it's not for the PC-sensitive. Racial slurs abound (so I won't quote from it) and Basil, with a head injury, continually makes references to World War II while serving a group of German tourists. No, it's not nice or culturally sensitive, but as the saying goes, ""If it's funny, someone's probably going to get hurt."" It's only television after all, which usually gets taken far more seriously than it deserves.
If there is anything negative to say about this collection, it's the bonus features. The interviews are great but the production quality is dreadful (did they hash these out to interns?). Bizarre and sometimes out of focus camera angles look more careless than experimental. At one point the camera outright violates John Cleese's personal space. If you can ignore the bad production, the interviews with John Cleese, Prunella Scales (who played Basil's wife), and Andrew Sachs (an English actor who played Manuel, the ""Spanish"" waiter who provides an incredible amount of comic relief, which I guess technically counts as ""brownface"") are a great watch. The only one missing is Connie Booth, who co-wrote the series and who's input is sorely missed.
Also included, though again badly produced, is a documentary about the origin of Fawlty Towers. If you're a huge fan (like me) you won't want to miss this (but just try and ignore the bizarre shots and wildly fluctuating audio levels).
Overall, it's hard to believe these shows were produced in the 1970s. They retain their freshness due to the painstaking work that went into them. There are few, if any, sitcoms from the 1970s (or even from today) that can make that claim.",1055721600,7,3864,4.992248062015504

The trials and tribulations of Mr. Fawlty are widely recognized as some of the best comedy TV ever made, and for good reason.  For better or worse, the series didn't have to stand up to the test of 100+ episodes, but the 12 they did make are absolutely priceless.
It usually starts out with a simple problem, usually a result of Basil's contempt for his customers (a recurring theme is his desire to attract a ""higher class"" of boarder) or his tight-fistedness.  The problem is then exacerbated by the help or the customers or by Basil's wife, resulting in total disaster and Fawlty's inevitable descent into hysterics.  If there's one thing that John Cleese can do well it's pitch a fit, and he does this with hilarious efficiency throughout the series.  Whether it be because his car has broken down or there's a dead man in the hotel, Cleese's gift for physical comedy is on display in all its glory.  The supporting cast is also excellent. There's the bellhop Manuel, whose failure to grasp the English language (along with his pet rat) makes for some interesting situations. Then there's Basil's wife, who recognizes Basil's knack for heaving himself headlong off the ship of reasonable behavior, and has long since stopped throwing him a rope.  Finally, there's Polly, the maid, who is the most reasonable person at the hotel, but always gets involved as an accomplice in someone's shenanigans.  And let's not forget the patrons of Fawlty Towers, who run the gamut from perfectly reasonable to psychotic (the Waldorf Salad guy comes to mind) to dead.  All these elements, along with the talent of the cast, combine to make for great situational comedy

485939,5,6302541743,"I would like to state a bit of a paradox:  while I believe MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS to be the greatest television comedy series in the history the medium, I believe FAWLTY TOWERS is the funniest.  With the former, much of the delight is the sheer intellectual or conceptual brilliance of the skits.  There is relatively little that is conceptual or intellectual about FAWLTY TOWERS:  it is a classic situational farce done as perfectly as is possible.  There is none of the self-reflective genius of Monty Python, in with the boys made fun of history, politics, society, the BBC, and the television medium itself.  Instead, we get the most absurdly funny character in the history of TV, one Mr. Basil Fawlty.
Of the members of Monty Python, several of the members were verbally brilliant.  Actually, any of the group was capable of saying something utterly off the wall and brilliant.  But John Cleese was the only member of the group who was a truly great physical comedian.  He was the only one who could have performed the Silly Walk.  His greatness as a physical comedian was never greater than in the two FAWLTY TOWERS series.  His disjointed, gangly contortions are perhaps the funniest this side of the double jointed Jim Carrey, and his verbal ripostes are even better than his physical comedy.
The cast as a whole is brilliant.  Prunella Scales as Sybil, acutely aware of Basil's absurdities while blithefully ignorant of her own, is the perfect ballast to Cleese's Basil.  Andrew Sachs is always delightful as the linguistically challenged Manuel (""Don't mind him, he's from Barcelona"").  American Connie Booth, co-writer of the series and married to Cleese for most of the series, was solid as Polly, sort of the ""straight man"" in the cast.
Besides the actors, the key to the series is the utterly brilliant scripts.  In a way, it is a miracle that there were 12 episodes.  Each show was packed with so many bits of verbal brilliance and brilliant conceived guest characters that it would have been impossible to sustain them beyond that number of episodes.
I will defend to my dying day MONTY PYTHON as the greatest TV comedy, but as much as I adore it, I have never, ever laughed as hard at anything on TV as at FAWLTY TOWERS.",1035331200,5,2243,4.772020725388601
485940,5,6302541743,"Here in the UK, John Cleese is regarded as a bit of a genius. With possibly the quickest wit and imaginitive writing skills as well as his unrivalled acting skills, this man is a heavywieght when it comes to light-hearted comedy.
Fawlty Towers is simply hilarious, and never disappoints, even when you've seen it so, so many times. I won't go on about individual gems, everyone else below has done a good Job with that.

If you have never seen the show before, this is an amazing package to have, and it is something you will watch over and over again. The show is timeless.
The DVD package gives you lots of nice extras, with interviews (old and new) with the main cast members, as well as a neat little cast and setting guide. One thing I never liked about the VHS issues was the picture quality, which was quite grainy. The DVD spruces up all the video and sounds, so the performance is optimal. The price is also quite reasonable, so value for money is assured.
Only 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers were ever made, and they are all in this package. It showcases the wit and charm of John Cleese, who plays an obnoxious hotel owner who does with several problems with guests. Believe it or not, it was inspired by a real hotel in England. The writing is razor sharp, and unlike most comedy shows, the jokes never get old. My favorite episode is ""The Germans"", with perhaps the best punch line  I have ever heard on a TV show (I won't spoil it, but it has something to do with who started the war).
The Fawlty Towers DVD set is an essential part of my DVD collection, right beside the Blackadder DVD set. Even people who don't like Britcoms will love Fawlty Towers, and will go back to it over and over again, as I do.",1028764800,6,1448,4.362962962962963

485970,5,6302541743,"Fawlty Towers is in my opinion the best comedy series ever produced..It is smartly written by Cleese and his then wife Booth, impeccably acted, and directed. Cleese excels as the neurotic repressed hotel manager, Scales as his cold and bossy wife, Booth as the trusted maid who saves the day many times over, and of course the excellent Sachs as Manuel, the Spanish waiter..Cleese refused to do a third series, and the series was terminated at its prime, which probably what makes it such a classic today.
The british have over the years made top comdey series, like Blackadder, Only Fools and Horses, Some Mothers do 'ave them and Absoluetly Fabulous, but Fawlty Towers remains at the top of the bunch. Its secret lies mainly in the very smart combination of situation comedy, very well developed characters, and some slaptsick, and of course in Cleese's performance.

485974,5,6302541743,"Nothing really needs to be said about this classic British sitcom, except that it contains some of the most brilliant, most hilarious, and most humiliatingly ghastly moments in the entire history of television.

And ""Fawlty Towers Complete Collection"" brings together the entire series in all its embarrassing avalanchal glory. It's one of those universally funny TV shows, all about the undignified exploits of a perpetually hostile, repressed and tetchy hotel manager, and the more competant staff who try to keep thngs sane, written with demented zeal (""That's Brahms! Brahms' Third Racket!"") and excellent comic acting.

Basil (John Cleese) and Sybil Fawlty (Prunella Scales) run a moderately-sized hotel in Torquay, with the assistance of the clever waittress Polly (Connie Booth) and the Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs) whose grasp of English is a work in progress. The hotel is home to a dotty old soldier, fluttery spinsters, and a revolving door of very dissatisfied customers.

Basil Fawlty (Cleese) puts out a snotty ad to attract a ""better class of customer,"" which attracts a pleasant aristocrat. Basil fawns revoltingly over the man, neglecting the other guests. But savvy waittress Polly (Connie Booth) discovers that another guest (who Basil snubs because he's Cockney) is a member of the CID -- and that Basil is in danger of handing his valuable coins over to a con man.

And it's not the last disaster that Basil only manages to make much worse: an inept gang of builders are called in while Sybil is away; a bunch of couples seem to be cheating on one another; four Germans arrive at the hotel just in time for Basil to suffer a brain-scrambling head injury; a deaf woman causes general hotel mayhem; and the creme-de-la-creme of Torquay society arrive for a ""Goumet Night,"" just in time for the chef to get drunk after Manuel rejects his advances. Hilarity (and roast ducks) ensue.

An American tourist who demands a Waldorf salad -- after the cook leaves for the day -- ends up tangled in Basil's web of lies; an overnight guest expires in bed, leading to a frantic cover-up; an anniversary party is wrecked when Sybil storms out just as the guests arrive. And after a health inspector condemns Fawlty Towers, Basil discovers that Manuel has a pet rat (""Is Siberian hamster -- a filagree!"") -- which is soon running wild through the hotel.

Anyone who's sick of the recycled sitcoms (""Hot Young Urbanites Fall In Love and Have Misadventures"") that pepper the TV landscape every single season might want to try ""Fawlty Towers"" -- the humour is still fresh, the writing is hilarious (""If the guest isn't singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning,' I don't immediately think 'Oh, there's another snuffed it in the night'""), and the actors were great at physical comedy.

Basically every episode is about a bad situation that Basil makes infinitely worse, until the entire episode is a landslide of lies, offenses and disasters. Each episode is full of gags (Basil strangling the gnome), misunderstandings (""There's a kipper sticking out of your vest""), and plots that revolve mainly around Basil's increasingly frantic efforts to keep everything ""normal."" Everything gets crazier as the episodes wind on.

And Cleese's writing is typically brilliant here -- Basil gets most of the great lines (""Always reminds me of somebody machine-gunning a seal"""") but there are some glorious bits of dialogue from others (""Will you stop talking about the war?"" ""Me? You started it!"" ""We did not start it!"" ""Yes you did -- you invaded Poland!"").

Cleese plays Basil as a slightly deranged, high-strung, incompetent guy who treats his customers like so many itchy spots, and Prunella Scales serves as the more competent, vaguely contemptuous counterpoint to him. Connie Booth's Polly is the only truly smart and clever person in the entire hotel, and usually gets sucked into Basil's freaky schemes (""Flying Tart!""); and Andrew Sachs is rather cute and sweet as the much-abused Manuel, whose half-learned English provides quite a bit of humor (""I am from Barcelona!"").

The new edition may be worth the dip for fanatical Fawlty fans -- apparently the entire series is being restored. Additionally, Cleese has gone back to record commentaries for ALL the episodes, and there are interviews with everybody in the main cast. Sounds like it's going to be good.

""Fawlty Towers Complete Collection""  is one of those shows that shone brightly and briefly, like a fireworks display. Hilarious, uproarious, and utterly timeless.",1016668800,,4524,5.090418353576248

I'm not going to spend a lot of time describing what Fawlty Towers is all about. Others have already done that. I just want to add my two cents worth regarding my enjoyment of them.
There aren't many shows I can watch repeatedly that still manage to make me laugh. Fawlty Towers is one of them. (In case you're interested, The Andy Griffith Show is another. I can watch that show literally daily and still laugh out loud. I never seem to tire of it.) John Cleese is a brilliant comedian with impeccable timing and hilarious facial expressions.
The entire show takes place inside Fawlty Towers, a fictitious hotel somewhere in England. Cleese is Basil Fawlty, the proprieter...a man whose distaste for his guests is barely disguised...and whose wife (Sybil, played by Prunella Scales) could win an award for nagging any day of the year.
The humor, although resorting at times to blatant slapstick, can at times be as keen and witty as any you'll find anywhere. It's a pity so few of these shows were made. The DVD set collects all 12 episodes (six from 1975 and six from 1979) and offers them up in pristine digital quality, with commentary by John Cleese, et al.
Fawlty Towers was a very funny show and I heartily recommend this DVD collector's set -- especially if you're already a fan of John Cleese's Monty Python humor. He's amazing as Basil Fawlty.",1013126400,8,1584,4.541958041958042

486003,5,6302541743,"I've watched the entire run of Fawlty Towers dozens of times and I laugh harder each time.
Picture and sound quality are great, considering the age of the material.  I'm no expert on video, but I think some folks are being a little picky.  These programs were produced over 20 years ago for TV.  The exteriors were done on 16mm film and the interiors were done on video tape.  This was not a theatrical release.  It looks to me like some work has been done on the shows, as they look and sound better than any PBS broadcast that I've seen.
The extras are great, with the exception of the first 6 commentaries by John Howard Davies.  It sounds as if Davies hasn't viewed these for years and remembered very little.  As a result, most of these commentaries consist of a lot of heavy breathing, sniffing, and slurping. He makes a comment about every 5 or 10 minutes on average. Still, Davies' noises can be amusing, especially at 3 in the morning! The last 6 commentaries by Bob Spiers are much better.  Spiers does far more talking and actually seems to have some memory of the shows he directed.  It would have been nice if the BBC had offered John Cleese a big pile of money to do commentaries for these shows.  Eric Idle was once quoted as saying that Cleese would do anything for money - He once offered him a pound to shut up & Cleese took it!  Cleese probably would have done a commentary...for a price.
The interviews on the discs are great.  Each disc contains a different interview with John Cleese, which are about 20 minutes each.  Disc 2 has an interview with Andrew Sachs who was Manuel. The interview is nearly a half hour and Sachs is very witty and entertaining.  Disc 3's interview with Prunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty) is good, but very short.
There are also a couple of great documentaries: One about the Gleneagles Hotel & Donald Sinclair who Fawlty Towers & Basil Fawlty are based, as well as a brief featurette about the building that acted as the exterior for Fawlty Towers and the fire that destroyed the building in the 1990's.  There are also about 5 minutes or so of mildly amusing outtakes.

Things I learned from Fawlty Towers:
1.  One nail isn't strong enough to hang a giant moose head on your wall.
2.  When your car doesent work, sometimes it helps to attack it with a tree branch.
3.  If you take a guest breakfast in bed and speak to him and he does not move or speak back to you - he may be dead.

486057,5,6302541743,"Fawlty Towers, among those who know about it, is generally considered one of the funniest television shows of all time.  Created by and starring John Cleese (of Monty Python fame), each of the twelve episodes is sheer genius in some way or another.
The setup is simple: Cleese plays Basil Fawlty, the rather snide owner of a second-rate hotel.  Cleese surrounds himself with hilarious characters, including his overbearing (but far more competent) wife and the bumbling but good natured waiter Manuel (""You'll have to excuse him; he's from Barcelona."")  Each episode finds Fawlty involved in some scheme, which usually has something to do with abusing customers and hiding things from his wife.  The plots build in classic screwball fashion, as the situations get more and more absurd while Cleese digs himself deeper and deeper into a hole. The comedy ranges from incredible dialogue to some perfectly timed slapstick, and all of it's funny.
Though I'd seen all of the episodes before many times, the DVD set was a great buy.  It's packed with extras, including commentaries by the director of each episode and some really informative, in-depth interviews with John Cleese and other cast members.  In fact, while I got the discs just because I wanted copies of the episodes, I've had a ton of fun with the extras.  Add in fairly nice packaging (the art on each disc is hilarious) and some other cool things such as cleverly designed menus, and this is one of the better TV collections I've seen.

486059,5,6302541743,"There are not many videos to which I would give a blanket recommendation regardless of one's tastes, but this is one of them.  No matter what type of humour you like, you will thoroughly enjoy this series.  Indeed, for the person who has yet to experience the sheer enjoyment and utter satisfaction that only well-crafted British comedies can provide, this is the place to start.  It was, in fact, the series that provided my introduction to British comedy just over 10 years ago.  My only regret was not discovering this series (and this genre) sooner!
The boxed set contains all twelve 30-minute episodes.  As a point of interest, it took John Cleese and his then-wife Connie Booth six weeks on average to write a single episode--a fact which should come as no suprise given the quality of the episodes, for there is not one that is anything less than a masterpiece.  Indeed, with skilfully interwoven subplots that progress with mounting speed towards an uproarious climax, this is without a doubt the most masterfully written (and certainly one of the most consumately acted) comedy series the world has ever seen.
John Cleese stars as the highly-strung, incompetent, socially-inept (not forgetting hen-pecked) innkeeper, Basil Fawlty, relegated to a life of penance in the form of marriage to the capable but overbearing, domineering, and brassy Sybil (Prunella Scales).  Throughout the series, the Fawltys are assisted (or hampered!) in running the hotel by their employees.  Firstly, there is the calm, intelligent, and extremely competent Polly (Connie Booth), a combination waitress, chambermaid, desk clerk, and general saviour without whom the hotel would surely collapse into evern greater chaos.  Then there is Manuel (Andrew Sachs), a Spanish immigrant whose unfamiliarity with the English language and customs results in some of the most hilarious interchanges of dialogue.
In addition to witty and comical dialogue, the series is loaded with the most side-splitting slapstick I've ever seen.  Manuel, for all his blunders, is usually the ""butt"" of numerous very realistic-looking kicks, whacks, and general manhandling by Basil.
In conclusion, there are plenty of other well-written, hilarious British comedies around, but Fawlty Towers stands at the pinnacle.  It is the yardstick against which all the others are inevitably measured.  It is, in short, representative of the very best comedy (British or otherwise) ever to be seen.  Extremely highly recommended!
(By the way, for those interested, October 2001 saw the UK release of a very good, beautiful quality tribute book entitled Fawlty Towers Fully Booked by Morris Bright and Robert Ross.)",1010016000,,2664,5.2992874109263655

486100,5,6302541743,"Comedy has always been a strange facet of human entertainment: a method in which the flaws of one's self - or the follies of mankind in general - are exposed and subsequently reduced by a knowing chuckle; the pain and suffering of miscommunication transformed into a cathartic moment of release.  Just as laughter is essential to the health and constitution, comedy can be an essential vehicle to gain insight into misfortune, to understand and perhaps overcome those same redundancies/patterns which plague the waking life.
Turn on the boob-tube on any given ""prime-time"" night and the options for said release are near limitless: a thousand and one situational comedies vying for your attention (and commercial dollar, of course).  But are any really worth the time spent? Given the plethora of recycled motifs - unresolved sexual tension, slapstick excess, emotional estrangement, miscommunication in extremity - do any of these time-worn human-flaw laugh-triggers produce more than a hollow snicker? It really depends on the quality of the script and the dedication of the actors, the competency of the men behind the camera and the synergy of the crew as a whole to produce something fresh and uniquely expressive from human angst.  Few comedies, in my opinion, succeed in this regard: year after year, the bulk of Hollywood output is a case of diminishing returns.  But then again, Los Angeles is not quite the cultural center is pretends to be, now is it?
In the late 1970's, John Cleese of Monty Python fame assembled a crack team of artists for an interesting variation on the situational comedy theme.  Based around the neurotic, perpetually grumpy hotel owner Basil Fawlty (played by Cleese), _Fawlty Towers_ is a heady blend of slapstick, misinterpretation and emotional overload, with impeccable timing and flat-out brilliant dialogue.  Comedy rarely gets better than this.
The episodes:
The Builders - Basil's ""need for the cheap"" comes on strong when the hotel needs repairs.  Naturally he goes for the lowest bidder for the job, behind his wife Sybil's back no less, with disastrous hijinks as a result.
The Wedding Party - The Heat is in the air one summer night, and Basil, guardian of British upper-crust morals, seeks to put a lid on the brimming sexual tension run rampant in the hotel...only to get caught in several compromising positions himself.
The Psychiatrist - When a psychiatrist comes to stay at Fawlty Towers, Basil goes out of his way to avoid the good doctor, subconsciously aware of his own unsteady sanity... all the while exposing his deepest anxieties and inconsistencies as he seeks to evict a (hilariously portrayed) debonair guest for ""loose conduct.""
Hotel Inspectors - Basil Fawlty has a low tolerance for tourists of any kind.  After an extreme bout of rudeness to a pretentious guest, Basil bends over backwards trying to make amends with what he thinks is a hotel inspector...and, upon discovering his error, will do anything to enact revenge upon the poor individual.
The Germans - After a slight concussion, Basil acts crazier than ever, and his unfortunate German guests must bear the brunt for some deep-seated post-war resentments.
A Touch of Class - One of my favorites.  Basil Fawlty is the consummate snob, spitting poison at the `lower class' guests while fawning all over those with the slightest title and/or bearing.  But what happens when his snobbery is taken for a ride by a confidence trickster? Many laughs, I assure you...
Gourmet Night - Fawlty Towers' first Gourmet Night seems to have everything going for it: a professional chef, the cream of Torque society, an eager Basil to genuflect and bootlick...yet events to not proceed as planned...
Waldorf Salad - An obnoxious American guest stops by Fawlty Towers, receives an eyeful of Basil's inconsistent managing style, and proceeds to ""lay it on the line"" with the gangly Brit.
The Kipper and the Corpse - a guest dies in his sleep and Basil runs himself (and the rest of the staff) ragged trying to conceal it from the other guests.  Probably the best tension-building episode of them all.
Communication Problems - Mrs. Hinderson is deaf and doesn't use her hearing aide because `it runs the batteries down.'  She and Basil are like oil and water, with a flame about to touch down...
The Anniversary - In his typical cruel fashion, Basil pretends to forget his anniversary with Sybil, all the while planning an elaborate surprise party.  But the joke is on him when Sybil stalks out and he must cater to his incoming guests...
Basil the Rat - Hands down my favorite of them all.  Spanish waiter Manuel has a pet `Siberian Hamster' that sends Basil into conniption fits upon discovery.  With a Hotel Inspector having already put a black mark on Fawlty Towers, this particular pet must be stashed away before the hotel is closed down for good...and when the furry little fellow disappears, all chaos breaks out in consequence.
If you are a fan of British humor in general and sophisticated comedies in particular, do yourself a favor: pick up this rare pinnacle of entertainment.  You won't be disappointed.",1007424000,17,5124,5.010588235294118

486102,5,6302541743,"If you've never heard of Fawlty Towers, you are truly missing a classic comedy series. Don't let the fact that it's British humor turn you away either. It's not your typical British sitcom.
Fawlty Towers was a series of 12 episodes made in the 1970's about a hotel in the little town of Torquay, England (pronounced Torkee). The episodes all revolve around the mishaps and misunderstandings and flat out irrational behavior of the hotel owner Basil Fawlty played by John Cleese of Monty Python fame. Cleese does a wonderful job melding physical comedy, sarcasm, and British wit, but of course he doesn't do this alone.
Prunella Scales (former RSC actress) plays Basil's wife Sybil Fawlty while Cleese's wife in real life Connie Booth plays Polly, the hotel maid/receptionist/waitress. Andrew Sachs plays Manuel, the Spanish waiter who does a fabulous job playing opposite Basil Fawlty and aggravating him to the point of frustration. Note that every character at one point in the series explains Manuel's funny behavior with the excuse ""He's from Barcelona.""
There are a few other regular characters such as the Major who is an old, rather senile war veteran and the two ladies who are also old and rather senile.
As I said earlier, there are 12 episodes. Each one is very original and I never get tired of watching them. The following is a short summary of each of the episodes.
A Touch of Class - Basil places an ad for the hotel to attract upscale clientele. A Lord Melbury makes reservations at the hotel, but he isn't who everyone thinks he is.
The Builders - Basil hires O'Reilly, a cheap Irish builder, to rennovate the hotel, but when he and his wife leave for an outing and Polly leaves Manuel in charge, everything goes wrong.
The Wedding Party - Basil gets into a series of misunderstandings when a flirty Frenchwoman and a young, sexually playful couple and their parents stay at the hotel.
The Hotel Inspectors - Sybil tells Basil there are hotel inspectors in town. He tries second guesses who the inspector is throughout the whole show and in the process is beat up, cries in front of a guest, and is frustrated beyond belief.
Gourmet Night - Basil attempts to serve a special gourmet dinner to the town sophisticates. Of course it goes terribly wrong. (watch him beat a car with a branch)
The Germans - Sybil is in the hospital with an ingrown toenail. Basil ends up in the hospital as well after a series of accidents, but escapes to the hotel just in time to greet some German guests.
Communication Problems - Everyone is frustrated when Mrs. Richards, a woman with a hearing aid she chooses not to turn on, stays at the hotel.
The Psychiatrist - Basil freaks out when he learns about two psychiatrists staying at the hotel.
Waldorf Salad - An English woman and her husband, an American, stay at the hotel. The cook leaves early and Basil fills in to cook the couple a hot meal.
The Kipper and The Corpse - A guest dies in the night and Basil has to get place the body in a discrete place until the coroner arrives.
The Anniversary - Basil pretends to forget he and Sybil's anniversary. He plans a surprise party that falls apart when she storms out angry.
Basil the Rat - A health inspector give the hotel one day to clean up their act. The hotel staff discover Manuel's pet rat (named Basil) and try to get rid of it.
If you like British comedy, this is definitely a classic to own. If you like comedy, this is a treat.
The best thing about these episodes is the detail involved in each episode. Every time you see the shows, you see something new. And all details in the episodes relate to each other. For instance in A Touch of Class, pay close attention to the pile of bricks mentioned at the beginning of the episode. You'll see them again.
Another little cute fact about the shows is the way the signs change during the title frame. The opening of the show is a scene from outside the hotel and the sign saying Fawlty Towers, but after the first episode, the sign changes to the point that it spells things such as Watery Towels.
Yes, the collection is on the expensive side but it is well worth the price and a must see for everyone. I am sure once you see these shows, you will watch them over and over again and love them for the classics they are.",1006560000,365,4276,4.5473411154345005
486103,5,6302541743,"The superb quality of the writing and performances in this British comedy masterpiece is well documented in many places, so I will limit my review to the technical qualities of this DVD: Fawlty Towers - Complete Series.
The content extras are great, including a few interviews, and the very entertaining short about the real Torquay and the eccentric innkeeper who inspired Cleese to develop the Fawlty Towers series (written together with Connie Booth, of course).
I've had FT on video for many years. Six months ago I moved into a large loft and installed a front-projection home theater. My screen is 162"" diagonal (13.5'), which is just huge. It's incredible for enjoying high quality DVDs but the much lower quality limitations of VHS (low scan lines) makes most tapes very unsatisfying to watch on such a large screen system. (I have since set about replacing most of my favorite VHS tapes with DVDs, as available. And this brings me to the much anticipated release of Fawlty Towers on DVD.)
I have encountered some DVD releases of television productions (1970's to 1990's) which were very disappointing in video quality. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the superior quality of DVD over VHS, since Fawlty Towers is from 1975-1979. But apparently the great popularity of this series in Britain led to outstanding preservation of high quality tape masters.
I was surprised to see such high resolution and detail, great color rendition (for a TV production), and totally stable imaging (no shifts, jumps, skips, blips, etc).
Considering its 1970's origin and that FT was produced for television, I would rate the video quality of this DVD at 10/10. I am extremely pleased, it's almost as good as film, and is absolutely at the top of its class when compared to virtually any other DVD releases of television programs from 10 years ago (or older). It's even better than a lot of poorly mastered DVDs of modern theatrical releases. They did an outstanding job digitizing FT from very high quality master tapes.
With the sharpness and detail, aficionados of FT will enjoy seeing subtleties in the character's clothing, the wallpaper, titles on books & magazines, times on clocks, and the intricate detail of all the sets and furnishings. And all of this detail will be new to you, since it was never possible on VHS. It's fascinating to enjoy these many nuances!!
I've loved Fawlty Towers for more than 10 years. And this superb DVD couldn't be better. Now I can admire this comedic tour-de-farce for decades to come.
Now if someone would just release ""The Rise & Fall of Reginald Perrin"" in an equally well-mastered DVD set, my dreams would be one step closer to fulfillment. (And make that all 21 episodes please, not just the first two seasons). By the way, if you haven't discovered ""Reginald Perrin"", starring Leonard Rossiter (also of ""Rising Damp""), try to get a copy ... I think it's also a britcom masterpiece.",1006473600,35,2936,4.885771543086173
486104,5,6302541743,"In the early 70s, while touring with fellow Pythons, John Cleese (and then wife Connie Booth) stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay, Devon, England.  After a day or so, the other Pythons checked out, but Cleese and Booth remained.  The others left for a nearby hotel, disgusted with the abusive behavior of the proprietor, one Major Sinclaire. Cleese -- as one might expect -- was fascinated and entertained by the rude and boorish attitude of Sinclaire.  ""He was awful.  And just wonderful,"" Cleese said in a recent interview.
When Cleese had an opportunity to create a new show for the BBC, he and Booth developed ""FAWLTY TOWERS"" (Warner Bros, ...).  When the pilot was submitted, it was met with resistance by top BBC execs, one of whom wrote a famous memo that said the concept and script was ""cliched, unfunny and claustrophobic.""
The premise is essentially about Basil Fawlty, a tightly wound guy who runs a hotel.  And all would be perfect in his world if he didn't have to put up with staff, including his  shrill but competent wife Sybil (Prunella Scales) and guests.
In 1975 ""Fawlty Towers"" slowly caught the attention of a core audience with only six episodes.  Reruns in the UK and on PBS really caught on.  In 1979 another six episodes aired and were a huge success.  Over time, a hard core audience has steadily grown around the world.  For the first time, all 12 episodes are available, digitally remastered, on a three disc set. An extended, funny and sometimes personal interview with Cleese on each disc is a wonderful primer on his take of why this series works and is more popular than ever. He reflects on the origins of the material and his memories of his stay at the Gleneagles Hotel and the late, infamous, Major Sinclaire; he talks about using taboo subjects that make an audience uneasy and thus more vulnerable to laughter; explains the meticulous attention to the writing process -- each episode on one idea with two and a half weeks on the plot and six weeks for the dialogue; he observes why it's funny when characters like Basil are forced to behave in a way the audience knows is not an honest and authentic feeling of that character at a specific moment of stress.  And he talks about this being a comedy of emotions as opposed to a comedy of ideas (""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"").  There are also interviews with Prunella Scales and Andrew Sachs who plays the hapless Manuel (""Que?"").  Sadly, cowriter and costar Connie Booth is nowhere to be found in the special features.  There's a startling and strangely emotional two minute video tour, with an operatic aria on the sound track, of the burned out Wooburn Grange Country Club that served as the exterior for Fawlty Towers.
But best of all are the 12 masterful episodes of outrageous faux pas, crazed desperation, manic dottiness and absurd gyrations.  See again or for the first time ""A Touch of Class,"" ""The Builders,""  ""The Wedding party,""  ""The Germans,"" ""The Psychiatrist,"" The Kipper and the Corpse"" and the rest.  They are the creme de la creme of sitcoms and arguably the best sustained six hours of farce in the English language.
Beware of the commentary track by director John Davies on disc two.  If it's not a sad accident of a swallowed mini mic, it is an hysterical put on.",1006128000,8,3283,4.696335078534031
486105,5,6302541743,"I have to admit that my thoughts about Fawlty Towers pre-viewer were, ""can anything be THAT funny?"" (I have rather a pessimistic nature) And the answer is yes, yes YES!
John Cleese is at his hysterical best (in both senses of the word)as Basil Fawlty. He is a comedian who makes a nervous breakdown the funniest thing in the world. Then there is the marvelous Prunella Scales as Cybil, his wife and (as he calls her) his little puff adder. Andrew Sachs is great as the sweet but always confused Manuel (he's from Barcelona). And of course, Cleese's real life wife at the time and writing partner, Connie Booth as Polly who runs back and forth between the bickering Fawltys and usually manages to benefit herfelf in the process.
The cast, as you can tell, is the reason it all works so well. For anyone who has never seen Fawlty Towers, it concerns the adventures of the staff and owners of the afore mentioned hotel. They have a talent for making a small problem into a full scale disaster until it blows up in Basil's face. And don't feel sorry for him either, he is a horrid person but a funny one.
My favorite episode is also ""The Germans"" with Basil suffering from a concussion ordering Polly and Manuel not to mention the war to some German guests all the while doing impressions of Hitler and other insulting things. As the German guest put it, however did they win?
The best tape in the set in the one with Communications Problems. It was the first one I saw and I nearly imploded from laughing so hard.

This all-too-brief series has been dusted off and brought back out with cast member interviews, a short tour of the town it was filmed in, out-takes, and commentary by the directors John Howard Davies and Bob Spiers
John Cleese (of Monty Python) is Basil Fawlty, a hotel owner who barely maintains his very last thread of sanity as attempts to manage a small hotel in Torquay, England.
Basil is continuously at odds with his more practical wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales), and his simple butler Manuel (Andrew Sachs).
Manuel is a waiter from Barcelona who serves as Cleese comic foil, and finds himself on the receiving end of Basil Fawlty's verbal, and horrifying physical abuse regularly throughout the twelve episodes.
The poor man is slapped, kicked, choked, gets his head slammed into a wall, is smacked with a frying pan, has his buttocks speared by a fork, and even has one of his eyes gouged by Basil in front of the guests who are usually attempting to eat a quiet meal while pretending to ignore the carnage going on inches away.
Andrew Sachs was compensated for burns suffered during the filming of the show, and nearly had his front teeth knocked out when Basil smashed him in the face with a spoon. The frying pan attack gave Sachs a headache for two days.
Basil's only real support throughout the show comes from the hotel maid, Polly (played by Connie Booth, a regular on Monty Python's Flying Circus, who with Cleese co-wrote the entire story).
Polly bails him out of danger constantly. By the end of the series it's apparent that she and Manuel are really the ones running everything, as they both attempt to cope with Basil's neurotic outbursts and ""sledge hammer wit"".
My favorite episode centers around a group of German tourists who have come to stay for the weekend in Toquay, and unwittingly booked rooms at Fawlty Towers.
Basil is obsessed with the horrors of World War Two, and won't let the German tourists forget ""who won the bloody war anyway"".
He marches like a rabid Nazi into the small dining room where they sit horrified. They finally ask him to stop going on and on about Hitler as he take their orders.
""You started it."" He cries defensively.
""We did not start it!""
""Yes you did, you invaded Poland!""
Fawlty Towers received rave reviews from the press, and was named the #1 television program of all time by the British Film Institute. It was also hailed as ""The best farce ever written in the English language"", and ""The Sistine Chapel of sitcoms"".
As a fan of Monty Python you probably already know about this one. If not, here's the prospect of seeing something that puts any American comedy to shame.
Falwty Towers is available on three DVDs with four episodes on each disc.",1004227200,22,2840,4.716297786720322

The sound of his breathing, swallowing spit and shifting about in his seat are excruciating! I can only imagine the microphone is somewhere in his nasal passages.

I've watched the episodes many times and keep finding new comic bits, puns, or facial expressions  to laugh at. The writing is tight and well-crafted. One understands why this series is watched 25 years after it initial broadcast and will be watched for decades to come.
The DVD is cleanly transferred and is filled with extras, most notably interviews with Cleese and the cast. Unfortunately, co-writer Connie Booth does not appear. The directors commentary is sub par and filled with bad sound and heavy breathing marring the otherwise high quality of the other bonus features. If Shakespeare ever did a sit-com this would be it. Good writing like this series lasts. One can only hope hollywood will get a copy of this DVD and start hiring writers again. All the rest follows, including the superb cast who all credit the high-level of the writing as their primary motivation for doing television.",1003708800,,1000,4.9523809523809526
486153,4,6302541743,"One of the best shows ever, this DVD was nearly done in by the awful director's commentary.
If you want to hear an old Englishman nose-breathe for six hours, listen to the director's commentary track.  The man breathes heavily, not saying a word for minutes at a stretch, then says one or two things, then breathes again.
Worse, it becomes patently obvious the director put no thought or effort into it.  He has not seen the shows for years, and didn't bother to give them a look before doing the commentary, and so many of his all-too-rare comments are along the lines of ""I don't even remember doing that scene.""  In ""Gourmet Night"", he doesn't even remember what Basil had gotten the duck switched for at Andre's restaurant until someone off-mike reminds him it's a trifle!
Frustrating, pointless, and embarrassing.
However, there is much good in the DVD.  The shows are themselves great.  The interviews with John Cleese and Michael Sachs are very interesting, indeed, and there's a mini-documentary about Torquay that is worth a look.
A couple of other niggles:  the interviewer for Michael Sachs digs into his ear with his finger on-camera, and the English subtitles are chock full of misspellings and typos.
A poor effort for the special features, but if you get the DVD at least the resolution will let you see a few things you couldn't with the videotapes--like Polly's satiric drawing of Mr. Fawlty as a junkyard with a collar and tie under it.
Only the show itself gets this DVD 4 stars.  Don't buy it for the special features, as except for the interviews with the cast members, they're pretty awful.",1003708800,5,1612,4.776978417266187

486155,4,6302541743,"For anyone, the 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers -- set in its namesake, a seedy British hotel -- could serve as an expert course on the construction and execution of the perfect farce.  John Cleese (of Monty Python) and Connie Booth (who both appear in the show) have created the last word in reference material for this comedy genre.  The video and audio quality of the DVD is excellent, and the shows themselves are hilarious and delightful to watch.
  The supplemental material is rather hit or miss, and sometimes outright strange.  For reasons that escape me, the directors' commentary tracks can only be heard completely isolated from the soundtrack of the show.  The microphone for the commentary was apparently placed up the nose of director J.H. Davies -- no kidding -- because when he is not speaking -- which is most of the time -- you can hear the wind whistling through his nasal canal, as well as the slightest snort or forced exhalation registering his amusement as watches the material.  You can even hear quite clearly as he slurps from a cup of tea.  On the whole, when he does speak (and I have only listened to 2 episodes of commentary), his comments are not always of interest. (Comments by director Bob Spiers seem better.)  More satisfying are interviews with Cleese and other cast members (though not Connie Booth! [sigh]).  A film of the abandoned and gutted building which served as the hotel goes on for five minutes, room to room, and is simply bizarre.  There is however, an excellent highlight reel of Fawlty Towers' best encounters between the ficticious staff and guests, and fun out-takes
  Don't buy for it the extras, but the set is worth every penny for the comic gold of these 12 perfect half-hours of laughter.  My personal favorites include ""A Touch of Class,"" in which Basil tries to lure a better class of clientele to the inn, ""Basil the Rat,"" involving the escape of the bellman's unlikely pet during a visit from a Public Health inspector, and ""The Kipper and the Corpse,"" where an guest's untimely demise requires moving the body from room to room.  Communication Problems is both a great episode and a particularly nimble demonstration of classic farcical techniques, if you're into that.
  I would have given it five stars if the supplemental material, particularly the commentary. was as good as the actual show.",1003363200,8,2357,4.823383084577115

The characters are terrific each one is well defined and carefully acted; from top to bottom each actor is brilliant.  I cannot remember a better ensemble cast of characters in any modern TV show.  Especially John Cleese, who is marvelous as the lead character, Basil Fawlty the bumbling, pretentious hotel owner.  The episode featuring ""The Germans"" is hilarious and can be viewed over and over again without boredom.  Included in each tape set are interviews with Mr. Cleese, who fills in behind-the-scene details.  These little nuggets are fascinating and add to whole program.

Well, maybe it's NOT up to the perfectionist Cleese standard (the young guy with the not-very-Cambridge accent interviewing Andrew Sachs puts his finger in his ear distastefully).
To my mind, the major drawback is the Director's Commentary, though interesting, this should have been better produced. Since you can not hear the soundtrack of the program, but only the panting and slurping of the directors, who occasionally comment (you can even hear people in the background being called on their cell-phone), some of the meaning of the comments is lost unless you rewind and change audio channel.
But you will find you can live with it, so... buy it!

486189,5,6302541743,"This boxed set is to TV comedy what the First Folio of Shakespeare is to dramatic theater. What makes ""Fawlty Towers"" so great is its simultaneous mastery of both high and low comedy. You get witty references to Brahms and Wittgenstein, soon followed by poked eyes and grabbed bosoms. Basil Fawlty is not only a triumph of comic writing and acting but also one of the most trenchant satires of the British character ever created. (Imagine if Carroll O'Connor had personally written ""All in the Family"" and you'll get an idea of the scope of Cleese's accomplishment here.) The supporting cast is as nearly as strong as that of ""Seinfeld"" (very high praise): the terrifying Prunella Scales as Lady Macbeth-in-a-bouffant-wig, the lovely Connie Booth (who you'd never guess was American) as the hidden brains of the outfit, and the superb Andrew Sachs as the world's worst bellhop. ""The Germans"" is probably the funniest half-hour of television ever filmed but all twelve episodes are gems.
According to a fan website, there are at least half a dozen real-life hotels that have named themselves after Fawlty Towers. Like Hamlet or Sherlock Holmes, Basil Fawlty has transcended the status of a literary character and in some way become a living being.

Of course, since I work in the Hotel industry, I can really appreciate all the humor but I really think anyone who works in any kinds of customer service would highly appreciate these videos.

In an interview with the League of Gentlemen recently one of them calls it ""the best thing ever done.""  So I sat down a couple of nights ago to watch some episodes, for the very first time, with high expectations.
What a letdown!  There is a certain distinctive style of British TV comedy (maybe this series was the archetype), in which all the characters scream at all the other characters, in every scene--- or for  occasional variety, one character screams at all the other characters!  It isn't funny.  [The first season of BLACKADDER had this problem, but the later seasons do not, making it, along with RED DWARF and RISING DAMP, among the best of the best.]
Since Basil Fawlty is in essentially every scene of FAWLTY TOWERS, he needs to be a character that makes some kind of sense... but instead he's an incoherent grab-bag of inconsistent elements. For example, he often says witty or clever things, and yet he is depicted as utterly mindless, incapable of drawing even the simplest correct conclusion about any situation, or deciding on any viable course of action.  The supporting characters are all one-note, but that's the way supporting characters are supposed to be.  It all hinges on Basil, and Basil is a hollow reed.  He isn't funny to look at, funny to listen to, or funny in his interactions with other characters and with the world around him.
I laughed a few times while watching the tape, but where I expected some comedy classic, I just saw a bunch of senseless, unmotivated and often very unfunny antics.
If you don't detect the slightest difference between the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, and Abbott and Costello, you may well find this a ""classic of comedy.""  Otherwise, it is going to be a viewing experience somewhat more painful than it is amusing .",993600000,11,1868,4.737654320987654

I must have seen each episode several dozen times and I still cant's stop laughing each time I see Basil do his goosestep and Hitler imitation, Basil whacking his dead car with a nearby tree branch, Manuel panicking when he is told that the chef put basil (the herb, not his pet rat) in the ratatouie (pardon the spelling), Sybil's absurdly comic laugh and ""I know, I know,"" and Basil's put down of a nurse ""Don't touch me!

And, no one can pull it off like John Cleese.

486257,5,6302541743,"Fawlty Towers is certainly one of, if not the best, British comedies ever made.  Written by John Cleese of Monty Python fame, and his wife at the time, Connie Booth, they tell the story of a hapless innkeeper in Torquay ""in the English Riviera.""  Every denison of Fawlty Towers is a caricature on a British stereotype, and the guests introduce some Americans, Australians, Greeks, etc., which are also suitable caricatures of their respective countries.  This series was obviously made before the era of political correctness, and is all the better for it.
This series is not a repackaged version of Monty Python.  While maintaining the same high energy, it is much more a traditional sitcom.  It's been my experience that Monty Python fans think the series is excellent, and that many people who hate Monty Python also like it - it's much more universal.
There are notable quotables too numerous to mention, as well as some very funny physical humour.  The replay value of the episodes is very high - I've had this set a couple of years and have seen every episode numerous times, but I still can pop in a tape and laugh out loud at the antics.  On this version, there are also interviews with John Cleese talking about the origins of the series as well as the inspiration for the specific events and plots of each episode.  While informative once, I always skip over them now.  It would have been nice to have seen some of the other cast members (especially Booth) in these interviews, but it's not to be.

You see a  clip, you know the episode instantly, you know the jokes instantly. If you  watch the episode, you know what will happen. Yes, it is funny. Yes, there  are episodes that I'll watch again, but there are still moments that I'll  hit the fast forward on, there are still scenes which I find embarrasing  (for some reason).

I don't know  of a series that ended just at the right time like this did, that retains  its charm even now. I do sing its praises...it's just that I can't watch  them like I used to.",926380800,3,916,4.242774566473988
486314,5,6302541743,"The wit and comical imagination of John Cleese is unsurpassed and this work proves it.  This collection of series offer us timeless comedy to enjoy over and over again.  In fact, the more times viewed, the more times  you will laugh and understand the idiosincracies of all the characters.  This hotel of horrors out does the Bates Motel!  What amazes me is that the  main character Basil Fawlty (the ???? Hotel Owner) is composed of John  Cleese's creative imagination but one thinks that there can be and are some  stressed out people out there that he represents!  If you enjoy British  comedy, this is one of the best.  If you want to give the British  Satirical, Dry, Sledgehammer Witted, Slap in your Face, Intelligent humor a  try, you cannot miss with this one.",923443200,4,769,4.69172932330827

486316,5,6302541743,"To give you an idea of just how loyal and popular this classic comedy series fan base is, last year my wife found me a 1998 Fawlty Towers calander to hang in my office. How many other shows that have been out of  production for 20 years can boast that? My favorite episode is ""The  Psychiatrist"". If you don't laugh when Basil climbs the ladder and  taps the window, have someone check you for a pulse.  If you like this  type of British comedy, check out ""Chef"" starring Lenny Henry.  Both series are a must for your library.",921110400,3,526,4.316326530612245
