6104490,5,B00GRZPQV0,"This anime is extremely worth it, even though it was only 13 episodes it felt much longer and kept up the suspense and the many turns in it were greatly fun to watch. The art and animation are breathtaking and are deserved to be watched by many; if you're looking for a new anime to watch that won't take much of your time then watch this; it is definitely worth every cent!!!",1396137600,21,376,4.236111111111111

6104494,5,B00GRZPQV0,"I was so completely mesmerized by the animation of K and have to recommend this series to all anime fans to see at least once. For me it is a series to collect since the story despite it only having 13 episodes did a good job of making us attached to the characters and then the opening and ending theme songs were so beautiful.

6104499,5,B00GRZPQV0,"Okay, so the first time I saw this series as a trailer on Viz Media's website, I was interested because both the art and (surprisingly) the English dub were very good from the little bits that I had seen. Now when I watched the show, the first episode STUNNED me. It was even more breath taking than I had ever imagined! In Blu-ray everything was just so clear, not to mention colorful, and the attention to detail, especially to all of the background art was incredible! Honestly, I've yet to see an anime since this one came out, that took my breath away like this. The story was interesting and kept me on my toes, although I will admit, it is definitely not perfect. However, it was still wildly enjoyable from start to finish, and it has become one of my top 5 favorite anime series of all time, and also one of the select few that I actually own. I can't wait for more of this series in 2018 now that the second season was popular enough for the studio to make more spinoff/prequels. Great job Gohands and Viz Media!",1490400000,,1022,4.356020942408377

6104505,5,B00GRZPQV0,"- Synopsis: This anime showcases the ongoing battle between chosen and powerful kings that fight over territory and control. Some have a hands-off approach while others are aggressively expanding their fighting strength. Our main character is suspected of murder. As such, he begins his journey to clear his name while avoiding numerous pursuers out for revenge. During his travels, he meets unique allies, as well as powerful adversaries. How will his fate end in this anime? Tune in to find out.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Like in reality, it seems history tends to repeat itself. Also introduces some interesting concepts in which certain areas within a country tend to have leaders and their respective followers. As such, there's typically constant friction between opposing sides as the battle for control of territory goes on.

- Analysis: Fits coteries perfectly, because whether a person accepts it or not, everyone can be categorized into cliques of some sorts. Whether it's being a gamer, liking anime, political views, religious beliefs, etc. Everyone has their various affiliations just like in this anime. Aside from the various powers they have, I would say this anime is pretty relatable to how real life is, in terms of what and how people conduct themselves. After all, some people want to feel needed, want protection, have noble causes, have nefarious intentions, or some other reason for associating themselves with like-minded individuals.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 13 episodes on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence, language, and fan-service. There's also censorship. Some f-bombs get dropped in the English dub. But both English and Japanese audio were excellent.

- Conclusion: Although slightly short, this anime is entertaining with their unique characters, dramatic scenes, interesting character interactions, appealing music, voice acting, visual style, and the like. If you enjoy this, look forward to the second season/movie. This anime is similar in ways to Durarara!!, as well.

6104516,5,B00GRZPQV0,"This show is amazing. The other reviews have done a good job describing the story, so I will just add a few things. First, the characters are so well-written and well drawn. They're complex and all have their own motivations and thoughts, and the animation is so good with giving them personality, with their behavior and body language. And they're beautiful. Also, it's true when they say the English dub is brilliant. I'd even say that the English voice actors saved a few of the characters and took them from ""really cool"" to ""absolutely amazing"". So yes. Watch this show.",1478217600,,575,4.76
6104517,5,B00GRZPQV0,A must see anime for me watching this anime it was a different experience than other available anime titles when it released. Has a great Japanese and English voice actors. This anime plot and and story is entertaining and action scenes and quality of the anime is good and I also like all the animes characters and i especially liked watching the main protagonist named Shiro the most but also liked the other clans and different powers they have.

That says it all. The plot is typical anime ""High schooler discovers a hidden power"".  I landed here after watching ""Pych-Pass"".  I was disappointed in the plot.

The Art Book is gorgeous it has different sections such as ""Poster Art"" , ""Character Bios"" and many others it's a really nice add-on if you really enjoy the series as I did some might say $50.00 is too much but think about it some blu-ray/dvd combos cost $40.00 maybe even 50.00 alone so for the limited edition case and art book as a fan of the series I say it's well worth it",1438560000,,644,4.119047619047619

Pros:
Unique big budget art
Great story
No filler or atrocious amounts of fan service
Great characters

Cons:

HOMRA is out for revenge for the murder of their clansmen. This doesn't bode well for Yashiro as there is a video of him committing the murder. Just when you think Yashiro is finally done for, a swordsman named Kuroh Yatogami pops out of nowhere and saves him only to announce that it is his duty to kill Yashiro for being the new evil Colorless king. Despite his better judgement, Kuroh ends up teaming up with Yashiro and his cat Neko team up to untangle the mystery.

I thought this series was absolutely fantastic. I loved the characters, the voice acting, the fast pace, the background music, the stimulating visuals, and the intriguing plot. I think I loved everything about this series except for the ending, which leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions.

6104577,5,B00GRZPQV0,No blood no ash no bones! I have heard of this anime before and was wondering if this anime was something that I would be interested in watching. Turns out after just the first episode I was hooked on to this anime. When I started to watch it I was a little confused at what was going on and what was going to happen. But after I got through 3 episodes of the series I finally figured out what was really going on. The series has good twist and turns to keep you on your toes through out the episodes. After watching the series I want to get the move to see how that is. All in all this is a good anime I would recommend this anime to friends.,1420329600,,643,3.953846153846154

6104580,5,B00GRZPQV0,"One day while running an errand for a classmate, Yashiro Isana, aka Shiro, finds himself being chased by some very intimidating men who seem to have it out for him. Not only does he not recognize any of them, but he doesn't recall having done anything that would require revenge against him. When one of his pursuers finally explains it to him, it still doesn't make any sense! Did Shiro really commit the murder they are accusing him of?

I wasn't really sure what I was getting into starting this series, as all of the reviews I had read basically said it looked really good but the story was confusing. Personally I found the story quite enjoyable - even though I knew that things can couldn't be as straightforward as the characters claimed, I still found the explanation at the end to be interesting and well done. The world this series builds isn't too complicated, yet it draws you in and rouses your curiosity. And everything looks good. Not only does the art style and animation look nice, but the characters have very stylish fashion sense. This was a fun change from series where ever character is always wearing their school uniform.
Shiro is a pretty fun character - he is extremely laid back, even when faced with menacing danger. The supporting characters aren't too complicated, but they are fun.

This series is only 13 episodes and manages to tell a complete story, though the ending certainly leaves the possibility of a sequel. Actually, it has a movie sequel and is going to get another sequel in 2015. I rather liked the way this series ended, so I am not sure if I will watch the sequel, but if you are left wanting more then at least you have something to look forward too.

This set isn't very complicated, containing just all 13 episodes (in both English and Japanese), trailers, clean opening and endings, and some convention highlights all on 2 discs. This is pretty standard for anime sets and I was perfectly satisfied with it and the price ($29.96).

This was a fun series and I recommend giving it a try if you think it sounds interesting. I hope you enjoy it too!",1418169600,11,2096,4.596256684491979

6104599,4,B00GRZPQV0,"If you love the style of animation for Samurai Champloo you'll love this! I know that at least one of the main artist for this series was also an artist for several episodes of Samurai Champloo which you'll definitely notice in the first episode. I had been sure this was a hybrid of artists from Champloo & Cowboy Bebop but have yet to find a link in any of the production crew from both on this anime. Having  same voiceover of Ed as one of the characters might have given me that impression tho. You might also notice styles from the Animatrixs, F.M.A and many others as well since so many people who worked on this project have been involved in many anime fan faves.

As for the story line, it's really a shame they didn't stretch this out for another season. By the references & flashbacks they have you'll think that they're going to be more important than they are and therefore elaborate further, unfortunately they don't. The overall point and significance of these are still pretty clear & they did a great job in foreshadowing, but you get the feel that either a deadline had to be met or they had to cut out a lot due to budgeting. Hence my four star rating which is still subject to change. Call me optimistic but this series was just too d*** good to not be continued!",1407715200,3,1282,4.405063291139241

6104602,4,B00GRZPQV0,"It would have been 5 stars if the writting was not too messy in the middle and the end of the show...it felt rushed

But the animation and characters , the seiyuu, the background music, the cinematography, camera work are 5 stars to me.

As for the ADR work  , I am happy with it.
As a anime fan who watches the japanese first and and as a trained  voice actor,actor  I am really happy with the effort they put into the ADR. Their timing and delivery is really good. Almost voice matching the seiyuu. There is no drop in the audio quality at all when I switch from japanese to english or vise versa. They picked the right voice talents for it, although Sam Regal voice is just a tad too deep for Shiro...but its ok, they sounded very natural in their lines. I can tell they took a bit of effort in picking the right voice talents for the role becuase almost all of them are spot on .
Its almost the same team that did Tiger and Bunny , the ADR on that was amazing too.

I really enjoyed watching the ADR version. Thank you ADR staff.

I saw the movie sequel and that was awesome . I would buy the american release when the ADR work is done on that one too LOL.",1405728000,,1160,4.083700440528634

6104604,5,B00GRZPQV0,"I didn't know what to expect of the English dub! I had seen the Japanese version on Hulu, and I LOVED IT! So I bought the DVD, only vaguely aware of the strong cast line-up. OMH. THE ENGLISH DUB IS AMAZING. It literally took me be complete surprise! Great dub for a great anime! And the extras on the second BluRay disc were so fun!",1403654400,24,332,4.123076923076923

6104609,4,B00GRZPQV0,"It seemed like there was a lot of hype leading up to this series, I'm not sure that it met all of my expectations though... As far as the pros, the art is breathtaking and is on par with what I would expect from a blu-ray, however the story left something to be desired. I really liked the concept, however I'm not sure I liked the execution of the content. Don't get me wrong, this is a good series that is better than some that I have seen, however I would have liked to see it be longer. This series will keep you in the dark until about the last 3 episodes, so be prepared for that. All in all, worth the money that was charged. The general premise is our protagonist is accused of a murder that he insists that he did not commit, and the story revolves around him and his journey to prove his innocence. Some characters have some pretty interesting powers, and some of the fight scenes are cool, but I would have expected more blood from the violence that is suggested. Not really any fanservice so that will please certain individuals.",1400457600,11,1041,4.316326530612245

6104611,5,B00GRZPQV0,"I had been watching the series online and fell in love with it so I just had to order it
The art book is lovely to look at as well and quite helpful for when I do my own drawings.

You have to carefully watch the storyline at times or you may miss important information.",1399939200,22,270,3.909090909090909
6104612,5,B00GRZPQV0,The art is beautiful. well save for the constant blue wash over a lot of it.  The animation and translation are also very well done.,1398384000,,132,4.28
6104613,4,B00GRZPQV0,"It is in English and you will hear voices that you have heard before...Sam Regal is the lead character. Sam Regal also was the the character ""Shiro"" in Fate Stay Night. This time he is also Shiro...I heard the voice of the person whom played Kai in Blood + as well.
  As far as the animation goes it is the same as Mardock Scramble...I heard it was the same studio and that is why it was taking Mardock Scramble so long to be made. Vibrant colors with richly detailed environments are the main in every episode. It was lacking a little on some explainations but none the less still a very likeable show.
  Shiro is suspected of being a murderer...there is even a video of the killer and it looks just like him. Yet Shiro swears he was at school at the time of this murder meanwhile there are people out to kill him because of this video. One such person finds Shiro and until he can prove that Shiro is or isn't the murderer he will not let him out of his sight. If Shiro is indeed quilty...he will kill him on the spot.
  So while trying to evade those who are after him...Shiro tries to piece together the puzzle of whom this person is in the video.
  My brief discription really does not do it justice but it is a very good show. I had seen it before and once I found out it was in English I bought it.",1398124800,2,1305,4.150793650793651
