Instead of just a front man Numan is a participant musician and a very good one.
I like this concert very much but it isn't as elaborate as his early large shows and the music performed is missing some key rhythm and percussion, much like the Telekon Live DVD.
I always liked the explosive harsh percussion, very industrial. It sounds more like a truck's airbrake here.
The performance of the song Complex is dedicated to founding band member Paul Gardiner (1958-1984), who died from a Heroin overdose. Chris Payne is guest musician.
Numan has stated the song A Child With The Ghost (1984) is a memorial for Gardiner, but is not performed here.
I don't care much for most of the newer songs here for personal reasons, too morbid and suicidal.
It is easy to be an apocalyptic prophet of doom, it takes effort to make things worthwhile.
Of all the Numan songs I have heard I think The Image Is haunts me more than any other. The work of authentic genius.
I've been a Gary Numan fan since 1980 and I'm getting sentimental in my old age.
I still love Futurism.

8422800,5,B004C58Y66,"The video/sound quality is fantastic. It feels like I am at the concert minus the sweaty crowd and smoke filled club. Sadly, I missed seeing Gary Numan when he came to Boston MA in 2010. But in my opinion, being able to see this concert on DVD with a big screen TV and surround sound is pretty amazing.",1338595200,4,302,4.224137931034483
8422801,3,B004C58Y66,"I think Numan's recent mini-tours of his most popular albums is a neat idea, but I for one am surely glad to see the 'trilogy' has finally ended with the Pleasure Principle tour.

Personally I've never been a huge fan of this particular album, I found the minimal approach kind of urksome at times, and while the songs are all definitive classics of Numan's, there are only a few songs on the album that I actually consider memorable, compared to the other albums of his 'trilogy' (I say trilogy in that his Replicas, The Pleasure Principle, and Telekon were the pieces that really made a name for him, though I'm just as big a fan, if not moreso, of the rest of his Beggars Banquet era catalog).  Anyway, one thing I did and still do really admire about Numan is his frequent re-working of older material to cohere to his new gothic industrial sound, it's always exciting to hear just how well his old output works with the new production values and image, and I love Hybrid--and various other re-workings he's done here and there--the Replicas and Telekon mini-tours as well, but this tour, well...

He doesn't exactly 'rework' any of the PP songs into a newer sound, in fact, he pretty much keeps them the way they sounded--in terms of arrangements and production--on the original album, which some fans may love, but I was really disappointed, not only because as I mentioned I'm not too into that album's sound, but because I feel he didn't live up to the effort of his last two mini-tours.  I also can't forget how cheesy Numan and the band looked, carrying their gothic industrial image as they played the old hits, it was just such a clash.

I just don't understand why he didn't do anything to the arrangements; he's done some amazing things to material from PP before, and don't forget the usual Numan concert pattern of splattering the last 1/2 of the show with his usual songs, like Are 'Friends' Electric?, Down In The Park, and Pure, just as he'd done on the other two mini-tours (why not throw some post-81-98 material in there for once?!).  I know I'm ranting something fierce, but felt I should put my thoughts out there.

I'd also like to make a quick mention of another aspect of Gary Numan's business; have you who is reading this recently been to his website?  If so, have you seen just how many T-shirts his company has for sale?  It's ridiculous.  Again, some people might not find anything wrong with it, but I personally get offended by a musician's obvious lack of proportion and priorities (of course, it may not even be Numan to blame, he might not have much to do with merchandise, but even so, it's a little tedius to me).",1318723200,3,2652,4.575949367088608
