1652419,5,B00005QIVV,He is a great actor and I enjoy him most as this detective.  Need more of his detective movies. Thanks.,1366934400,,103,4.15
1652420,4,B00005QIVV,"I'm a big Karloff fan but when I first saw one of these Wong movies featuring him as a Chinese detective, it also struck me funny but from what I've learned back in the time this film was made they weren't too fond of using Oriental actors for lead roles which is also why the two fellows who played Charlie Chan also weren't Oriental.
But if you can look past all of this which I'll admit isn't always easy to do as Boris' English accent is very much in play throughout the movie it's still a fun mystery to watch.  A bit corny but hey, sometimes even today's movies are corny and yet fun to watch so if you like the classic mystery films with a bit of over-acting involved I suggest giving this film a try; I think you'll like it too.",1313193600,,736,4.146853146853147
1652421,3,B00005QIVV,"The Fatal Hour is part of a six series serial made by Monogram Pictures some time in 1939.  It was tough keeping up since I was jumping in mid-series, but the story was interesting and some parts were unintentionally funny.

The plucky female reporter, the grouchy Police Captain Street, and the suave and smooth detective Wong (Karloff, with a striking Oriental look thanks to some Hollywood magic make-up).

The characters were somewhat stereotyped and Karloff played his part well.  I loved the fact that the events occur in San Francisco, apparently part of a jade smuggling ring!  A jeweler down on his luck involves himself secretly in smuggling jade stones, worth several thousand a piece (quite a lot in 1939 money!).

The jeweler's son wants the business but is naive and knows nothing of his dad's nefarious smuggling to keep the business afloat.  To complicate matters, the son is in love with the woman who is also part of the smuggler's ring!

The way Detective Wong figures it all out and comes to his conclusions and faces the murderer is quite well done, though not as smooth as Philo Vance or The Thin Man, still an entertaining bit of pre-war mystery.

Best Line:

Jeweler's son, accused of murder, being yelled at by the police captain.
Mr. Forbes, a friend of the now-dead jeweler says to give the boy his constitutional rights.

Captain:  ""Yeah, I'll give him his constitutional rights!  This is a murder investigation!""

This film was well before the Miranda decision (""you have the right to remain silent...etc.""), and so was quite funny.

I can't wait to watch more of this series.  I'm especially interested in how the Asian (""Oriental"" in the film) actors are treated.  Fatal Hour did pretty well for itself.  Interesting seeing Jason Robards, Sr., father of the more famous Jason Robards, Jr. in a bit part.

1652422,3,B00005QIVV,"This is more about style than substance. I enjoyed all of the classic mystery elements, from the detective's incessant yelling to the lady journalist's relentless pursuit of ""the scoop."" Visual quality is pretty good--except for Boris Karloff's makeup. That's just laughable. Overall, this is an entertaining flick, but it doesn't hold a lot of surprises.",1302566400,,355,5.472727272727273
1652423,4,B00005QIVV,"Finally, I make the acquaintance of ""Chinese copper"" Mr. Wong.  I'm a big Boris Karloff fan, but the thought of him playing a Chinese investigator has always struck me as a bit weird.  Every so often, the makeup actually makes him look a tiny bit Chinese, but his accent is thoroughly English.  No matter, though, because Karloff is a great enough actor to make the part his own, anyway.  The film itself is vintage stuff, with all of the 1940s detective movie clichs showing up in spades.  You've got the obvious suspect playing it really cool with the cops, the disgruntled policeman determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, and of course the nosy femme fatale journalist always getting in the way but ultimately playing an important part in the end.  I had a great time watching Police Captain Street bark orders left and right - he yells at everybody at least once, except for Mr. Wong.

Captain Bill Street (Grant Withers) calls in the help of James Lee Wong (Karloff) when a fellow cop washes up on the beach dead one morning.  The dead cop had been investigating a jewelry smuggling ring down on the San Francisco docks, and since there was an Oriental link to that investigation, Wong is happy to step in and provide whatever assistance he can.  A tip links the dead cop with the Neptune Club, and that makes the club's sleazy owner, ""Hardway"" Harry Locket (Frank Puglia), an obvious suspect.  Captain Street also finds a mysterious connection to a costume jewelry store owned by Frank Belden, whose son is mixed up with a dame connected to Locket.  Things get more complicated as a series of additional murders take place, and Captain Street gets grouchier as the bodies begin to pile up.  He's particularly annoyed by Bobbie Logan (Marjorie Reynolds), a newspaper reporter who is always getting in his way and interfering with the investigation.  Street is fortunate to have Wong on his side, as his own ""yell at him until he confesses"" interrogation techniques fail to crack the case wide open.  In the same vein, though, Wong is fortunate to have Street backing him up when he succeeds in putting all of the pieces of the puzzle together.  That dame reporter proves pretty handy as well, in the end.

This isn't up there with Sherlock Holmes or anything, but Fatal Hour offers up a pretty good whodunit that plays out somewhat unpredictably.  The characters are pretty stereotypical, but that's what you expect from a film of this era.  Personally, I want my 1940s flat-foots gruff and moody.  Karloff's good, but Mr. Wong is too subtle and methodical a character to carry the movie on his own - that's why Grant Withers pretty much makes the movie for me.",1192060800,10,2675,4.701716738197425

1652433,3,B00005QIVV,"Boris Karloff is playing Mr Wong.  He was a good actor but I did not buy him as Mr Wong.  The accent was not right.  He did not really look chinese either.  I understand that this is just a movie but I think they could have picked an actor who looked and spoke the part.  That aside Boris did a good job playing Wong.
The movie started with a dead cop being found on a beach murdered.  Cap Bill Street pulls in Wong to help him find the killer.  Along with the nosy journalist, they struggle to find anwers to who killed the cop before more murders happen.  Of course there a few more murders before Wong reveals who the killer is.",1461024000,,631,4.114754098360656

Mr. Wong is wealthy and respected, which makes his effortless friendly fieldwork with working class cops and news reporters either acceptable or unbelievable.

7951484,3,B00005QIVV,"With any of the 'B' movies from Monogram you have to remember that they used these films as a filler for the main attraction. If you keep this in mind when you watch it you'll enjoy it for what it is. Comparing this Wong story to others it is a good film, a step above many of them. Since the movie is in public domain the cost is free. The Amazon Prime copy seems to be better above than others available on the net. This the fourth of six available and there are lots of clues including an early remote control radio which will put a smile on your face. Karloff is a little different than you're accustom too with the slick down black wig and the slanted eyes and he speaks in a British accent. The co-stars Reynolds and Wither are like the Thin Man only not married. Adds a little humor to the story.",1479772800,,803,4.153846153846154
