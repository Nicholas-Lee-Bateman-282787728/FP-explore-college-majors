8235459,5,B000ZG4KVE,This is an excellent series.  I now have all five and it's a great way to learn about - and hear a complete work in classical music. Recommended.,1444435200,,145,4.178571428571429
8235460,5,B000ZG4KVE,"I absolutely adore Brahms! I could not live a year in my life without his music accompanying the course of events and seasons. I am committed to classical music from the early Baroque (Monteverdi, Cavalli) through the early 21st century (Wolfgang Rihm, Pascal Dusapin, Stockhausen). However, I could happily spend all my listening time with the core repertory of the German-Austrian tradition, of which Brahms is a shining beacon. I have not heard a recording of Brahms's Violin Concerto which did not fill me visionary delight, but this one is first among equals. Gil Shaham, totally committed, performs with the passion and precision that are Brahms's trademarks. And Claudio Abbado (whose illness is sadly obvious) accompanies with his own passion and precision. The prevailing mood is that joy rising out of melancholy which spreads over the audience enveloping them completely. This is music which enriches, restores, deepens, even redeems, and the assembled musicians more than fulfill the potential of such great music. When the concert was over, I played a cd of Brahms's late piano works, what better way to bring such an experience of immanence (or is it transcendence? Your call.) to a mellow conclusion.",1416528000,,1215,5.204081632653061
8235461,5,B000ZG4KVE,"This performance begins with a commentary on the concerto featuring Gil Shaham, the soloist.  Shaham's charming and his love of this masterpiece is inspiring.  The performance was filmed in a grand Italian hall with the Berlin Philharmonic and Claudio Abbado.  I didn't see the date of the performance, but looking at Addado it must have been toward the end of his life; he is so thin and appears rather ill.  Nonetheless, he gives it all and the performance is breathtaking.  Shaham, of course, is beyond brilliant.  Even on a DVD, as well-filmed as it is, the power and magic of these great artists are palpable.  Being someone who generally avoids filmed orchestral performances, this one was a real joy.",1415836800,,707,4.890756302521009
8235462,5,B000ZG4KVE,Very nice compilation of some of Brahm's music.  Very enjoyable to listen to.,1408665600,,77,4.923076923076923
8235463,5,B000ZG4KVE,"This DVD is part of the Discovering Masterpieces of Classical Music series from EuroArts, and consists of a documentary about the creation and building blocks of the piece itself, as well as a performance of the work by Gil Shaham and the Berliner Philharmoniker w/ Claudio Abbado.  The documentary is full of interesting information about Brahms and the special relationship he had with his friend the violinist Joseph Joachim, and features commentary from musicologist Wolfgang Sandberger who runs the Brahms Institute at the Lubeck Academy of Music.  It is fascinating, and more than a little bit awe-inspiring, to see Mr. Shaham discuss some of the finer points of the piece, and then jump right into the bars he is talking about and hear that glorious music come out of his violin as if it is effortless.  We expect nothing less, but it is still amazing to see.

As for the performance itself, it is incredible.  Mr. Abbado allows the orchestra to throb and swell and the interaction with Mr. Shaham is just unbelievable.  I am extremely envious of those who got to hear this performance live at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo.  This is musicianship of the highest order, and the star is the music - an organic, living thing when performed this way.  It is incredible.

If you like the music of Brahms, and appreciate the artistry of Gil Shaham, then buy this disc!  You won't be disappointed.  If you are unfamiliar with either of these two, then buy this disc!  You'll learn something and see what truly great musicians can do.  Highly recommended.",1313280000,2,1554,4.818867924528302
8235464,5,B000ZG4KVE,"This DVD is part of the EuroArts series entitled 'Discovering Masterpieces of Classical Music'. Previous issues have focused on Strauss's  Alpine Symphony, Bart&oacute;k's Concerto for Orchestra, Dvor&aacute;k's New World Symphony, Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto, Schumann's Piano Concerto and Mozart's 'Jupiter' Symphony (No. 41), most of which I have reviewed here at Amazon. This DVD focuses on one of the great violin concertos, Brahms's only work in that genre, here played by violinist Gil Shaham accompanied by Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic in a live performance at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, Italy. This performance is taken from a DVD from the series 'Europa Concerts', a number of concerts by the Berlin Philharmonic played in various theaters around Europe.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Europa-Konzert-From-Palermo/dp/B0007ACVBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Europa Konzert From Palermo</a>&nbsp;I reviewed that concert (which also includes Beethoven's Egmont Overture and Dvor&aacute;k's New World Symphony). In my review I said of Shaham's and Abbado's performance of the concerto 'Gil Shaham, surely one of the handful of really great violinists on the scene, plays the Brahms Violin Concerto. Rarely have I heard such a combination of technical ease and deeply musical expressivity in this thrice-familiar masterpiece. The Adagio is particularly moving. The long opening oboe solo, played by Albrecht Mayer, is meltingly beautiful; Shaham's playing here is ethereally haunting. There is no dearth of violinistic fireworks in the outer movements.' I can add no more than that. It is a luminous performance.

There is a half-hour documentary that precedes the performance in which various people -- Shaham, several musicologists and a narrator -- make comments about the circumstances surrounding the writing of the concerto, paying particular attention to the friendship between Brahms and the great violinist, Joseph Joachim, for whom the concerto was written and who gave the first performance. There is also clearly-stated and enlightening commentary about the structure of the concerto with special emphasis on the melodic and emotional content of the work. Although I have known this concerto for over fifty years, I learned things I had not known before. The documentary is primarily in English, with much commentary from Shaham himself who plays several musical examples, but with some contributions by German-speaking experts. There are excellent subtitles for the few parts that are not in English. (And, of course, if you are, a native German-, French-, Spanish- speaker, there are fine subtitles in your own language.)

This is a fine production which I can wholeheartedly endorse.
