4117772,4,B003F3NE1Q,"Note: I don't know if the show forgot, but Izzy inherited like 8.4 million dollars.  She gave some of it to the clinic, but kept most of it for charity work.  Izzy would not have been left with a $200K bill.  I don't know why the show thinks the viewers would forget that Izzy inherited over 8.4 million.

******************************

I was going to give up Grey's Anatomy on DVD after Season 5 because I thought Iggy and George both died.  Izzy didn't die and I miss her; she was my favorite on the show.  Anyway, this is the season of chaos.  Mercy West has merged with Seattle Grace.  Owen is there with Christina and he has PTSD.  Christina is frustrated because there is no cardio thoraic surgeon to teach her.  Torres and the new doctor are lesbian lovers (I don't see the chemistry, but whatever).  Lexie has turned out to be the best new intern in my opinion.  The other interns for Seattle Grace were clearly cast because they are not good looking and goofy.  The Mercy West interns are the exact opposite, gorgeous and too aggressive.  The show gives me a headache, but I love the medical aspects of the show.

Note: Pompeo must be pregnant.  They made her have liver surgery for her father, yet her father is not shown again and she herself is not seen until later episodes or she is sitting down.",1430092800,,1311,4.4641350210970465

I'm not even talking like a tiny barely noticeable scratch, I mean like WHOA! I double checked my order to confirm I purchased a NEW item and not USED or REFURBED and I did purchase NEW. I decided to see if it would play uninterrupted, and fortunately it did. This 4 star review is more for the manufacturer than the show itself. When people purchase a NEW item, it is expected to not have any defect or blemishes, especially ones that could potentially compromise the intended use of the product.

I crying, jaw dropped, and screamed at my tv scream with all the shootings. When writers take risks like how these writers took risks I believe tv would be great. Not only shooting 4 main characters, but also putting all the main characters in jeopardy is a risk no one usually takes. Shonda Rhimes did it and it was just wow! It was such a hard episode to watch, but I couldn't stop. Not only was the writing superb, but so was the acting. Every single person brought there A game! I'm catching up as I am a few seasons behind, but season 6 as a whole was great. Most shows can't pull a 24 episode with no dull episode or storyline, but they did.",1386806400,,786,4.143790849673203

Now in retirement have time to find out what all of the fuss was about.  And am puzzled.  Grey's Anatomy, is it about a hospital or a highschool? Being old and having a lot of experience in these matters, I must say that this series is a serious slap in the face to all of the people in the medical profession. I realize the paycheck is important, but a lot of the main characters must have had a hard time to keep from gagging when asked to say some of their lines. Have called a halt in the middle of the 6th installment as just cannot take any more creepiness.  So much disrespect for the people saving lives every day. Am glad I did check it out though, as it has made me better informed about the entertainment media and what they are up to.

4118346,5,B003F3NE1Q,"I'm a very, very picky TV viewer. I really am. And I find it difficult to bond with characters, or even come back to a show again and again, and with enthusiasm, but not with Grey's Anatomy.
Every season is excellent. You'll find the most well rounded, lovable, and interesting characters on television. And you'll laugh out-loud as much as you'll cry. This series has been made so superbly, and it's one of the only shows that my husband and I both agree on, and that we both look forward to. There's not a person alive who cannot identify with at least one of these characters, and I love that the writers aren't afraid to encroach on an interesting array of subject matter.

One of TV's finest and most entertaining.",1354579200,,719,4.530769230769231

4118350,5,B003F3NE1Q,I love this episode! Arizona is so loving and supportive. Callie's pain is heartbreaking. The Met/Christina connection is at it's best. And Alex is both his battle scarred best and touchingly vulnerable. Of course classic lines from most of the cast add the very rich icing to the cake.,1350777600,,286,4.857142857142857

It was beautiful to see how each of them mourned George in their own way. I really enjoyed how they tied the character's deep sense of self into the scenes. Not to give anything away about the episode, I feel this was a great introduction to a great season on Grey's. The writing, the acting and the filming is really good this year.

So sometimes I can't watch an entire episode because the disk skips over ""damaged area,"" when though when i look at the DVD there appear to be no visible scratches. Despite this I'm still in love with this series and am thankful I have already seen the episodes and am rewatching them, otherwise I'd be a very unhappy camper.",1338768000,,491,4.590909090909091

Learning about George's death has really spoiled the remainder of that season 5 for me. I live in an isolated location where I very happily don't see any trailers or other television that would have made me aware of the content of this episode.

The best television has to offer, no exaggeration. I was ready to give up on Grey's Anatomy. Then I bought this on sale at Walmart and I couldn't stop watching it.
This season had George's death, the hospital merger with Mercy West, and of course, the many relationships around Seattle Grace. I found the idea of the merger to add a new twist to the show. A lot of the character's true colors started showing. And the new characters introduced this season, while the ""enemies"", were likable.
Overall, I completely recommend this season even if you aren't a fan of Grey's Anatomy.",1309305600,,591,4.747572815533981

Maybe not quite as many tears as season 5, although I reckon the first episode of 6 will make you cry enough for the rest of the episodes!  It's quite funny in places and it's good to see other characters getting a look in as Meredith and Dereks relationship takes a back seat as they start to settle down.  A token appearance by Addison made me happy as she's one of my favourite characters!

4118430,5,B003F3NE1Q,"In 2005, ""Grey's Anatomy"" became a critically acclaimed television series that would become ABC's top rated dramas and winner of two Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.

Created by Shonda Rhimes (""Private Practice""), the drama series revolves around a group of interns and their experience at Seattle Grace Hospital. As well, as a few of the other doctors of the hospital. Throughout the first five seasons, we see these interns become residents and experience relationship problems and also the stress and challenges they face as resident doctors.  The last season was a bit more dramatic as love was lost, love was found and we saw one of the main characters battling cancer, while another dies in a tragic accident.

Season six features a merger between Seattle Grace and Mercy West and this season introduces us to new doctors and characters who will have an impact on the current main characters.

NOTE: On ""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season"", there is an extended episode of the season finale ""Episode 126 - Death and All His Friends"".

VIDEO:

""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 televisions. When it comes to television drama series, ""Grey's Anatomy"" is one of ABC's highly rated dramas that although filmed in a hospital setting.  The cinematography for the final episode was excellent.  For the most part, the series looks good on DVD, nice good closeups and skintones are natural and during low light scenes, I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts. For the most part, the fifth season does look very good on DVD.

It's important to note that since the release of the fifth season of ""Grey's Anatomy"", that season received a Blu-ray release and more than likely, there will be a Blu-ray release for this sixth season.  For those who want better picture quality and lossless audio, I recommend the Blu-ray release.

AUDIO:

As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable, while the music has always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes.  I did notice more surround usage in the final two episodes.  From the sirens, gun shots, crowd ambiance being utilized through the surround channels.

The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

I admit that I was critical and harsh of the fifth season of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and just felt the show was heading downhill through the first half and the season managed to pick up during the second half.  So much was focused on the problems on the set with Katherine Heigl and T.R. Knight.  And eventually, we know how things have ended up in the season finale.

With last season focusing on Izzie's cancer, her relationship with Alex and problems in the relationship between Meredith and Derek and dealing with Callie and Lexie's personal issues... I felt that with the sixth season ""Grey's Anatomy"" is desperately needing to step things up with the writing as I have felt needed to interject some new blood, new energy before the storylines focusing on these characters becomes overly stale.

And sure enough, the writers have achieved that with the sixth season.  The merger between Seattle Grace and Mercy West was probably the best thing to happen with this show because we have new characters.  Also, we have stories focusing on Derek and Richard's troubles, we get to see more of Arizona (especially Arizona and Callie), the introduction of Teddy and most importantly, the introduction to the new residents coming from Mercy West.  These four characters have brought some new life to the series and I was really rooting for them because I can see potential storylines that can come from these new characters.  I felt ""Grey's Anatomy"" had new energy, new life and I'm stoked about the series all over again.

That was until the shocking season finale.

All I can say is... ""Wow!"".  Although we have seen a similar type of storyline on ""ER"" several years ago, it's a big gamble as you don't know who is going to be killed off.  But suffice to say, this season finale was a major success and the writer's have crafted one of the most impressive season finale's in a drama series within the last decade.  A fantastic way to end the season and at the same time, a bit bittersweet as some characters that may have grown on us will not be back due to the tragic season finale.

Needless to say, ""Grey's Anatomy"" writers really did a fantastic job with this season.  I felt the fifth season, although good, was in somewhat of a slump and I have to admit, the season opener of the sixth season, wasn't all that great either.  But as the episodes progressed and seeing how these newer characters were integrated into show, I definitely saw the potential, almost like ""Grey's Anatomy"" reborn and seeing its greatness return to television.

As for this DVD set, there are a good amount of special features including the web episodes of ""Seattle Grace: On Call"", deleted scenes, a featurette on Chandra Wilson as a director and the extended episode of the season finale.

With that being said, there's not much I can say badly about ""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season"".  It was well conceived this season, the acting was very well-done (and I can understand some hardcore fans feeling that their original characters were not utilized as much as previous seasons but with more characters, the series needed new energy and these newer characters provided that) and overall, it was a solid season that literally ended with a bang.

If you are a fan of the series, ""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season"" is definitely recommended!",1285286400,9,7601,4.8752922837100545
4118431,5,B003F3NE1Q,"I bought this for my mother, I honestly don't know how she got into Grey's Anatomy, she recently retired after having worked 3 jobs for the past 20+ years so I guess now she is just enjoying kicking back and one day came across a rerun of the show. Needless to say, she is addicted.  She really seriously loves this show, its all she talks about, she calls me just to tell me that someone went around shooting all the surgeons because his wife died.  She sends me text messages at work telling me that someone ran to stop the procedure on a patient that is allergic to something they were injecting...and as you can see I still have no idea what she is talking about.

But she loves this show, I bought her all of the seasons so that she can catch up, and of course she called me at work asking me if I was going to watch the New Season with her.",1285200000,,846,4.115151515151515

4118433,5,B003F3NE1Q,"In all honesty, the very first episode of this season made me very un-sure how to feel. I was so shocked by what had transpired that I had to convince myself to stick around. Oh gosh, am I glad I did. What an amazing season. The characters have developed so immensely and it is incredibly entertaining to watch. Not to mention, the actors were spot on in their characterizations. Such excellent acting this season. The story lines were interesting, engaging, and really heart wrenching at times.
The season finale was the most intense two-hour television event I had ever watched. The entire time I was on the edge of my seat. I showed it to some people who absolutely loathed the series, and they ended up changing their minds.
This is a must have for anyone who enjoys down right good television.",1284854400,3,798,4.626760563380282

4118435,4,B003F3NE1Q,"First let me start off by saying that I have seen every episode of Grey's Anatomy and Season 6 is by far my favorite.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the last 4-5 unaired scenes in the bonuses section on disk 5 don't work, I tried 3 different players. Anyone else have this problem?",1284508800,,284,4.163636363636364
4118436,5,B003F3NE1Q,"I have been watching Grey's since the beginning, and there are some awesome episodes.  But nothing compares to the finale last season.  It is one gripping two hours of television that you don't want to miss out on.  The season overall is good, and has it's definite highlights; but nothing compares to the season 6 finale. Spoilers ahead...
The season starts with George's death, and later in the season Izzie leaves.  It feels somewhat strange at first, but George was in so little of last season I honestly didn't notice his departure as much as Izzie's.  We are introduced to some new doctors as the merger happens.  They are probably the only thing I didn't like about this season, as I found most of the annoying, with the exception of Dr. Avery.  Alex deals with the loss of Izzie and their impending divorce, Christina and Owen have a relationship hurdle to jump over, Callie and Arizona have a 'baby' of a problem, Derek becomes the new chief and all the hardships that come with that, a blast from the past comes back to haunt the Chief, Bailey gets some love action, Lexie and Mark part ways, Meredith deals with her father and a very significant loss.  If that isn't enough to entice you, then the finale should be.  A gunman is loose in the hospital and no one is safe.  Literally every moment has you on the edge of your seat and in a perpetual state of shock.  Some don't make it out alive, and others will never be the same. When I watched it live I could hardly wait for the commercial breaks to be over.  I never thought any episode would be better that the season 2 finale, but this episode makes that one look like a filler episode.  Overall this was a great season with a season finale to 'die' for! Don't miss the season 7 premiere September 23rd!",1284422400,11,1768,4.453416149068323
4118437,5,B003F3NE1Q,"Even though the season started with a huge blow, (the death of one of the most loved characters, George)and the aftermath of it, this season was still the greatness we have come to love from Grey's. In the course of the sixth season, we lose two of our original interns and yes, it takes a while to grasp this. But we also get a new shipment of residents from another hospital. Five new doctors, five new stories, but they're thrown at us in a negative light, their back stories are withheld and we immediately don't like or want them. One in particular for me (Dr, Avery) earns his right to be there and even flirts with the possibility of becoming a power couple with Dr. Yang, who happens to be my favorite character. The rest of the season throws the characters some curve balls. Karev deals with the loss of Izzie, Cristina and Owen come to some hardships with the introduction of an old Army friend,  Meredith has to deal with her father again, Derek takes the Chief position away from, well, the Chief. If there were any doubt of whether or not we had an interesting season on our hands, the finale comes and blows everyone away. Literally. What a GREAT season finale. Personally, I never thought the 2nd finale (Denny dying, Izzie in her prom dress, Meredith choosing between Derek and the vet, all happening to the soundtrack of Chasing Cars) could be topped. But yes, yes it can and it was. The season closes after an incredibly scary standoff between a shooter and the hospital that left everyone on the edge of their seats. Out of the dust, Cristina and Jackson emerge victorious after having saved the day. Richard reclaims his hospital, some of the staff doesn't make it, and fans become a little more sympathetic toward the ones they didn't like before. Overall, an amazing finale to end a great season.",1284076800,,1818,4.593846153846154
4118438,5,B003F3NE1Q,"I have watched Grey's Anatomy since it's premiere episode of season one. I was immediately drawn in and became a fan overnight. I own every season on DVD, every book, poster, calender, refridgerator magnents and key chains they have put out. To put mildly I am one of the biggest fans of the show. No other show has ever gotten to me the way Greys has. I see myself in Meredith so strongly and I believe that is one of the ways this show has become what it is now, people can relate to the characters in a way other tv shows cant convey. I also work in a Hospital and a lot of the things that go on is so similar to Greys. Not the shooting rampage in the season finale of course but many other things ring true. I highly recommend season 6 as it is just as intense and wonderfully written and acted as the first 5 seasons were. Can't wait for the season 7 premiere September 23rd!

He was the kind of guy who could be calm in an emergency, while at the same time....tug our hearts with his kindness.  This episode was just incredibly sad....hard to imagine G.A. without him.  Everyone I know will miss our favorite tv surgeon......bye Georgie!!!!",1283385600,,423,4.915492957746479
4118440,4,B003F3NE1Q,"I've been a follower of this show since the very beginning, and it's definitely had its ups and downs. Seasons 4 and 5 weren't my favourites, but Season 6 was MUCH more like the Grey's I'd come to know and love. I actually cared about what was happening. Can't wait for next year!",1282262400,18,280,4.30188679245283
4118441,5,B003F3NE1Q,"Excellent preview of Greys Anatomy Season 6 - of course I would have liked to seen more.  I pre-ordered this box set in April for what was then August release, and now I have to wait til September - not happy about that at all.  Callie's reaction to George's passing was a bit surprising and it was a lovely tribute to the type of person her character is, and that George really was HER ""McDreamy"" - even after all of the history.  I was/am so sorry to see George's character written out of the show - I thought he was great - a great balance - funny, smart, sensitive, loving and caring.  But, it's a show and it's his life - he is so talented he's got a lot of acting to do beside Greys.  Just my opinion.",1279756800,,707,4.094202898550725
4118442,5,B003F3NE1Q,"Grey's Anatomy is NOT for the faint of heart. The characters get under your skin and become family. Watching them grow and evolve is like watching your own family grow and evolve. This season was incredible, and I highly recommend it to anyone interesting in some incredible storyline and great acting. Especially the finale... you won't be able to stop talking about it!",1278547200,24,371,4.904761904761905
4118443,4,B003F3NE1Q,"I've watched the whole season on tv and it was just a typical grey's anatomy season. More drama and comedy between the characters, but I see that they have grown a lot since season 1. The only episode that I loved the most was the finale - It was very well acted and intensifying. It was very overwhelming the whole time and I highly recommend that everyone watches it - even the non-grey's fan. Very powerful and moving, and very sucessful. Can't wait for the next season.

This is a good addition to your grey's anatomy collection and I recommend that you buy it.",1277337600,14,565,4.4326923076923075
