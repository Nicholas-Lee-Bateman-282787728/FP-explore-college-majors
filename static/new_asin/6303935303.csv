734176,4,6303935303,"Spencer Tracey continued to deliver a hilarious performance as a father-in-law who shunned his responsibility as a grandfather. The film stroke a deep chord in grandparents-to- be. Fighting over the choice of names, doctors, places to raise the baby. And Spencer Tracey portrayed a loving father, who worried and panicked, while his wife Joan Bennette may get overexcited at first but accepted the new changes with an eager heart. It was an ingenious touch to arrange the baby and grandfather to have a rocky start.

Spencer Tracey was funny and assumed his role effortlessly. The story infused the emotional ups and downs of the expecting Elizabeth Taylor and the not so ready grandparent Spencer Tracey with laughter. The young and radiant Elizabeth Talyor certainly helps. The not so plausible factor would be the unreserved cooperation of the other parents-in-law. Spencer Tracey's narrative was cleverly crafted - what he said was timeless and applied now more than ever.",1152748800,,976,5.2165605095541405
734177,1,6303935303,"I love this movie, but this is the worst quality DVD I have EVER seen. I am SO disappointed. Why is such a terrible version out there to purchase as a ""new"" DVD? It's so clearly a copy of a copy of a copy of the film.",1138579200,3,217,3.6382978723404253
734178,3,6303935303,"Most of the original cast of ""Father of the Bride"" (1950) returns for this cute sequel.  Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett play the parents of Elizabeth Taylor, who married in the prior movie and is now expecting a child.  Bennett reacts with excitement and is prepared for her daughter to move back home so that she can help raise the child.  Tracy, on the other hand, is horrified at the prospect of being a grandfather and has a mid-life crisis of sorts.  The movie did almost as well as the original, finishing as the #11 money-maker of 1951.

With Vincente Minnelli at the helm, you know that the movie can't be bad.  It's cute and the cast is fine.  In addition, at just 82 minutes in length, the movie really flies by quickly; however, it's just too insubstantial and predictable.  I smiled a few times but never really laughed.  Accordingly, whereas ""Father of the Bride"" was nominated for a boatload of Oscars, including Best Picture, ""Father's Little Dividend"" was shut out of the nominations.  Overall, ""Father's Little Dividend"" is a mildly amusing and likeable romp but probably not a must-have for your collection.",1094342400,3,1125,4.782383419689119
734179,3,6303935303,"I'm sure it seemed a good thing to do -- follow up on the success of ""Father of the Bride"" with a chapter two.  There are a few fun moments here and it is nice to see the entire cast reunited, but the sequel lacks the strength of the original.  It's decent but far from memorable.
In this case, the Steve Martin remake, which diverges almost completely from the plot of the original (for good reasons), is more enjoyable.  I found the end of this version, with Stanley misplacing the baby, a bit dark and not treated comically enough.
Many reviewers have lamented the poor sound quality of the DVD.  Well, with a decent sound system it ends up sounding like most VHS copies.  What is more embarrassing, at least on this DVD packaging are errors in the trivia game -- they don't even get Ellie's name right!  Did they even watch this movie?

(1951)
. . .

This sequel to Spencer Tracy's better-known comedy hit, 1949's ""Father Of The Bride,"" is an odd film -- not a great success dramatically, but an amazing document of its time and an unusually serious and explicit examination of what starting a family back in the pre-feminist era of the early 1950s was like... Tracy reprises his role as Elizabeth Taylor's sweet but gruff father, but now instead of facing the challenge of ""giving away"" his daughter, now he's bent out of shape about becoming a grandfather. It makes him feel too old; he's thrown into competition with the other grandparents; his daughter gets overwrought and emotional, and after all that, when the baby is finally born, the little booger cries every time he sees Grandpa!

A lot of this film will be fascinating to our baby-obsessed present-day culture. There's a great scene where, as Tracy comforts his pregnant daughter after all the other grandparents have been too controlling and intrusive, she tells him about her wonderful new, progressive-minded doctor, who turns out to be some kind of kook who advocates that parents (well, mothers) carry their babies around everywhere for the first two years, and he freaks out and goes to the doctor behind her back to give him a piece of his mind: what's completely normal and commonplace now in 2013 was beyond the pale back in '51... You can't carry babies around! That's crazy talk!!  Also surprising is a scene where Tracy's wife scolds him for being so negative after the kids announce their pregnancy -- he complains that they're too young and too naive to have a child, and she reminds him that they had their first child born out wedlock, three months before they got married, and that she had to miss her high school graduation because she was knocked up at the time: not quite the sanitized Ozzie & Harriet world we imagine in the post-WWII era.

Overall, the script is fairly flat, basically a checklist of problems that can confront a young family, viewed through the lens of their parents, and the movie moves from set piece to set piece without building up much actual narrative momentum. Still, it's an interesting snapshot of white American culture at a particular moment in time, and is more frank about a lot of marital issues than one might imagine. Plus, it stars a 20-year old Elizabeth Taylor, and she's wonderful to see onscreen. Other reviewers have dinged this film because of the low-quality remastering and while I watched a different edition, the one I saw was also pretty blurry and muffled -- but I rated it based on the calibre of the film itself, not the technical quality of any particular edition. It's not a great movie, but it's worth checking out from a historical perspective. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1384473600,,2811,4.825726141078838

734430,1,6303935303,"The reviews shown here for ""Father's Little Dividend"" are a prime example of what I dislike about the way Amazon handles reviews.

Most of the reviews say that the picture and sound are horrible, but to which company's DVD does the review refer?

Amazon, please put each review with the product it describes; and reviewers, please take time to note the company whose edition you are reviewing. Some movies that have slipped into public domain have been picked up by many different companies. It would be very helpful for those of us who enjoy reading the reviews to know which company's DVD we're reviewing! Thank you!

The father talks about his life. His mortgage is paid off, what is next? Stanley has plans for a vacation with his wife Elly. They visit their newly married daughter for a family event. Stanley is grumpy (some hidden fault?). The talk tells about the characters. Has life passed him by? Will over-exercise help him? [The talks is supposed to be funny.] Will their daughter and son-in-law move in with them? Or the husband's family? But Buckley got a mortgage for a house in a new development. [How many newlyweds want to live with their in-laws?] Elly and Stanley visit the new house. We see the gifts for the nursery. What will they name the baby? [More comedy.] We see why the young couple don't live with in-laws! How will they raise the baby? The Doctor recommends closeness between mother and child. [Still true today?]

There is a crisis in the middle of the night. They had a fight and Kay left. ""An argument?"" Is there a lack of trust? Will they make up? [Yes, they have to fill up the time for this movie.] A phone call tells Kay is at the hospital. Elly speeds to the hospital. [A car chase to add action.] It's a boy. There are scenes at home. The baby cries when Stanley is near. Elly and Stanley become babysitters. Their lives change. ""Six o'clock!"" Young boys play soccer at the park. Stanley gets involved. Who moved the baby carriage? There is drama here. The name of the baby is Stanley Banks Dunstan.

734596,3,6303935303,"This movie was produced in 1951 after the success of Father of the Bride, also directed by Vincent Minnelli. Stanley Banks (Spencer Tracy) and Ellie Banks (Joan Bennett) are happily married couples; when their daughter Kay Banks (Elizabeth Taylor) marries Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor) and moves out of the house. The family tries to settle down without Kay in the house; but soon the news of Kay becoming a mother hits harder to Stanley and Ellie than Kay. Stan still feels romantic towards his wife but the news of him becoming a grandfather is a little unsettling. In addition, constant meddling of Kay's in-laws, Herb Dunstan (Moroni Olsen) and Doris Dunstan (Billie Burke) in planning the lives of their son and daughter in law, and flaunting the wealth and money is not only annoying but obnoxious to Banks. Ellie banks shows equal interest in decorating the house and helping the young family, but this is a little more than what Kay had bargained for a married life.  The movie revolves around Stanley Banks and the usual changes and adjustments in life after ones daughter gets married and the arrival of new members of the family. This has all the drama of a typical family; Elizabeth Taylor looks adorable, and offers fine performance as the daughter of proud father Stanley banks. Although the first movie (Father of the Bride) was highly touted with nods from Academy during nominating process in the categories of best picture and best actor, this movie was not nominated in any category.

Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

Its not necessary to watch Father of the Bride first, since the very title gives away the plot, but if you like classic movies, feel free to watch it before diving into the sequel, Fathers Little Dividend.

The entire cast returns, giving a repeat performance worthy of Edward Streeters original characters, from the silliest obstacles to Spencer Tracys narration. If ever there was a grumpy actor who could pull of hostility towards impending grandfather-hood, it was Mr. Baked Potato himself, Spencer Tracy. Im not a fan of Spence, but he really is perfectly grumpy in these movies, just as the character warrants.

In this one, Elizabeth Taylors expecting a baby. Father isn't looking forward to the little critter taking over everyones lives, and he tries to combat everyone elses excitement every step of the way. I love these movies; they're so hilariously true to life even now, even though there are dated Honey Im home elements sprinkled along the way. Both Father movies are funny and delightful; pick them up for an old movie marathon over the weekend!

DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, theres one scene in this movie that might be not your friend. Father and daughter sit on a bench swing and talk, and it might make you sick. In other words, Dont Look, Mom!",1500422400,,1360,4.824034334763948
