The graphics aren't very good... you can tell that they have quite a bit of age to them. The orange fella is too bright and hard to focus on. Definitely not like shows now days where everything is clear and crisp. This looks like a child's paint program on a computer.
I would not recommend this to anyone with young children as I worry that watching those graphics are not good for young eyes.",1393804800,,475,4.348314606741573
8356741,5,B0028R1M28,"My son adores these movies.  Loved them at 2 loves them still at almost 5.  Like that there is live animal footage and he's learning something.  These are the only ""cartoons"" he watches at home and he's happy with that!  Wish I could get them on the iPad.",1349049600,,255,4.25
8356742,5,B0028R1M28,Our daughters 2 & 5 will watch these over and over and the information is really good for them. I've learned a bit as well just listening :),1342828800,,140,4.035714285714286
