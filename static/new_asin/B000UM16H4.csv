8213810,5,B000UM16H4,Both the tape and the DVD were in exceptional shape. The tape was in good shape for its age. The picture and sound quality was good. The DVD did not have any scratches on it and there was no freezing or skipping on the DVD throughout the duration of the viewing. A great buy!!!,1416441600,2,277,4.148148148148148
8213811,5,B000UM16H4,"I used to rent this VHS from Blockbuster video all the time. I think if I added up the late fees my poor mom had to pay because of this ridiculous movie I could have bought her a house. Anyways, I'm the first to review this on Amazon and probably anywhere because no sane human on Earth has either:
A: Heard of this movie
B: Gives a damn about it
C: All of the above.

I bought this off of a 3rd party seller from inside my own state who may very well own the copy that I used to rent. Imagine that! I just completely blew my own mind with that idea. Whoa. Anyways, not only did they send me a copy of the film in great condition, but they also went out of their way to transfer it to a DVD and give me a copy on that format too! Now that's service! That's like ordering a dinner set from Crate & Barrell and they toss in a gift certificate to a fancy butcher shop because they feel bad that there is no meat on the plates!

Meat on the plates! What am I babbling about? Trying to write a hundred reviews today has possibly fried my brain. I'm taking a break....",1392940800,4,1062,3.957943925233645
