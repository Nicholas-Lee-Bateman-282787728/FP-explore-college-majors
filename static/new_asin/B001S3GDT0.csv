3783183,1,B001S3GDT0,"You know, I was very excited when I read about the pending release of these movies. I bought a boxed Laserdisc set many years ago for well over $100 so the price here isn't a factor. However, if what people are saying here in their reviews is true, a message needs to be sent to Paramount loud and clear that we won't be duped.

The fact that there are Director's Cuts of these and they aren't going to put them on the Blu-ray release can only mean one thing: that they are going to do another release later that has them. It will be hard to hold out for the proper versions but I'll have to do it. This is unfortunate news indeed. I don't want to buy them twice on Blu-ray.",1236384000,15,674,4.106060606060606

3783185,1,B001S3GDT0,"uhhh... Only directors cuts?  You've got to be kidding Paramount..  I agree with the other reviewers..  Paramount needs to do justice to these classic Trek movies and release the Theatrical & special editions, and clean up the picture & sound.  Just like MGM did with the bond series using the lowry system. ( i think thats how its spelled)  But alas they just want to milk this like it was on DVD.  I've only owned the Vhs of the first 6 because by the time the standard(special edition)  dvd's came out there was a lot of talk of HD.  Now they're giving us this crap? No thanks... i've seen the DVD special editions and those looked pretty bad,  so theres no way im spending my dough on the $20 +(for each) paramount double dip scheme....",1236211200,59,740,4.4222222222222225

3783188,3,B001S3GDT0,"The video and audio of these Blu-ray discs mark a clear improvement over previous DVD releases, but they are problematic and could be better.

First, it should be noted that the theatrical versions of all the films are presented in this Blu-ray release. This means that the previously released Director's Cut version of Trek I with the new special effects is absent, as are the versions of Trek II and VI that contained extra footage. This guarantees that there is going to be another Blu-ray of these films in a few years.

Video:

The video boasts the types of improvements you'd expect from Blu-ray vs DVD: vivid image, few signs of MPEG compression on large screen TVs, etc. As other people have noted, Paramount went overboard on the digital noise reduction. FACT: Film has grain. This is one of the characteristics of film that gives it its unique look and texture. Putting aside the debate of grain vs. no grain vs. some grain, the problem with digital noise reduction, is that by removing film grain, you also strip a layer detail off of the video (the problem is akin to tape hiss reduction with analog audio recordings). The reduced image fidelity from DNR is most notably on actors faces. As a result, the video quality could be a lot better.

Trek II underwent a comprehensive restoration by Lowry Digital. The video is crystal clear -- you can see where the makeup begins and ends on Nimoy's face -- and like the best Blu-rays, the video retains the look of film. Excessive grain that resulted from use of an optical printer for special effects shots (such as Kirk talking to Kahn via the Enterprise view screen) has been reduced without also reducing image fidelity. Please note that the overall look of video is still soft with muted colors, but that's because Trek II was essentially a low budget film. The film stock they used and cinematography were at best serviceable. So don't expect the video to look like film was photographed by Vittorio Storaro. But Lowry has done a fantastic job and it is hard to imagine Trek II looking any better.

Audio:

In all the movies the audio has more presence than previous DVD releases, with the stereo imaging spread out wider. Most notable is that ambient sounds are more audible. As expected, the more recent the film, the better the sound is. The sound on Trek VI is really quite excellent.

Extras:

With the exception of Trek I, all the special features from the previous 2 disc DVD versions has been carried over. Not all of the features from Trek I were brought over because some were specific to the Director's Cut version that is not featured on the Blu-ray.

All the movies feature a new commentary track and a few new featurettes. Frankly, everything that can be said about these films has been said over the last two and three decades. The new extra features are at best filler. With the exception of Trek II, the commentaries are not by the filmmakers, but people who have been involved with other Trek movies or TV shows. This was an interesting idea, but really didn't work out well. Understandably, no one wants to say anything critical of another person's film, and folks rather talk about their own Trek projects. That being said, Ron Moore's commentary on Trek III is pretty entertaining, and he's not afraid to be critical of the film (though I think he goes out of his way to say nice things about it at the same time). The only refreshing thing about the commentaries is that multiple commentators broke the silence on how much they disliked Trek I.

By far the most substantial new special feature is the ""Captain's Summit"" which features a roundtable interview with Shatner, Nimoy, Stewart and Frakes, moderated by Whooppi Goldberg. It's certainly entertaining, but again, doesn't offer new insights. If you're buying this set, you've probably seen many of the interviews these actors have done for other DVD releases, on TV, etc. For instance, we yet again hear that the TNG actors hated their space suits. Kinda problematic is that Shatner and Nimoy dominate the interview, and whenever Stewart and Frakes are trying to make a point, Shatner interrupts them with lame questions. At one point Nimoy nicely tells Shatner to shut up and let Frakes and Stewart talk. I got the idea that Frakes is really the most interesting of the group and I wouldn't mind hearing a one-on-one interview with him. The one noteworthy thing, is that when asked what they were most thankful to Star Trek for, Shatner and Nimoy said financial stability, and Stewart and Frakes said friendship.

Bottom line:

Given that these films are eventually going to be re-released on Blu-ray to contain the extra footage that has been included on previous DVD versions, and that hopefully at that time the video problems will be fixed, I say you're better off renting these titles instead of buying them.",1235260800,5,4854,4.758620689655173

3783239,4,B001S3GDT0,"This review isn't about the technical video quality or film merits (which, in a word, are flippin-awesome).  This is just to let you know that the 2016 release of the Original Motion Picture Collection (6 disc, slim bluray case with cover showing illustrations of the characters on a white background) contains the exact same discs from the 2009 release (7 disc, thick box set with a white cover with blue starfleet badge, containing 6 films each in their own slim case + a 7th Captain's Summit disc) but without the Captain's Summit bonus. Thats why I docked the set 1 star on an otherwise 5 star set.

For those of you keeping score with Paramount/Universal's aggressive sales department, this marks the 3rd re-packaging of the same set. Well, technically the 4th if you count the ridiculous ""Trilogy"" release which only included films 2-3-4. The discs and content are literally identical, down to the ""copyright 2009"" printed on them.

So if you already own one of the previous sets, don't pay any attention to this release. In fact I would say the best release to get (for its packaging alone) would be the 2009 white box with blue star fleet insignia. No only does it give you the extra Captain's Summit disc, but having each film in its own slim case beats juggling and possibly dropping the other discs as you're fighting with the stupid plastic release mechanism which I can't believe disc case manufacturers still haven't been able to get right. For real, this is 1980s technology, and I for one have travelled MILLIONS OF MILES... oh, thousands of miles to find a movie case that works. Wake me when they figure out how to make them out of transparent aluminum, eh?

Anyway, head over to the 'bay and see if you can pick up an old copy of the 2009 release. As of the writing of this review (summer 2017) it looks like people are unloading their 2009 sets cheap, probably seeking to ""upgrade"" to the newest package. I grabbed both the Original and Next Generation sets together for 10 bucks plus shipping.

Another thought I figured I'd plant in your head is that new movies are getting the 4K blu-ray treatment these days, so I predict in about 2 years once Universal has milked this set for all it's worth, we'll hear about a 4K release of all the Trek films. So don't blow the bank on this package; it will neither live long nor prosper \\//",1499212800,,2353,4.606205250596659

3783243,4,B001S3GDT0,"1) ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" the first of the the six movies has undergone alleged digital enhancement coloration involving the Star Fleet uniforms being the wrong color than that in the original movie. the uniforms were light grey in the original and light blue in the newer blue ray version. Other than that flaw there is a second flaw involving the Star Fleet jackets worn in the last scenes meeting Vger / Voyager probe physically. In the original film the jackets were tan and they were changed to yellow. The new yellow jackets did look better to me.
The movie was very enjoyable in script and special effects.
2) ""The Wrath of Kahn"" was done very well except, I didn't want to see the character Kahn's bare chest scenes with his open shirt design. Other than that flaw, I enjoyed the script and special effects. The red jacket uniform looked effeminate like the Canadian Mountie's red jacket uniform
3) ""In Search of Spock"" I enjoyed the script and special effects except for the scene of the pretty Klingon women on the human freighter spaceship being killed by the Klingon bird of prey spaceship's captain, to prevent any possible further intelligence leaks about the Genesis Device that he wanted to confiscate and use as a .weapon against the Federation.
4) ""The Voyage Home"" about saving a pair of Humpback Whales in San Francisco was too goofy for me and gets a thumbs down for script and special effects, The reverse time travel to Earth scene was especially low quality special effects, involving the Enterprise's crew on the confiscated  Klingon bird of prey spaceship of them portrayed as talking white colored statues.
5) ""The Final Frontier"" had a mediocre script about Spock's half brother seeking a Vulcan mythological heaven on another planet but, great special effects.
6) The Undiscovered Country"" I enjoyed the script and special effects involving Kirk and McCoy being framed for murdering the Klingon peace negotiating Chancellor then, sent to a Klingon prison planet colony.

This set, or at least the first movie, is of the original release NOT like the DVD Director's Edition.  Very bad job in what looks like a simple transfer from video to disc.  There were clods of dirt or something on the camera lens in several scenes in the beginning along with color fading, purple faces. Yuck.  I'm so disappointed that I'm forgoing watching the rest of the movies.

However, they're still great movies at a great price, and the picture and sound are better than I would have expected from films of that vintage. If extra features are your thing, you'll find a boatload of them in this set.",1484697600,3,438,4.688311688311688

3783301,2,B001S3GDT0,"This is not a review of the film - I love Star Trek and all things Star Trek - this is a review of the packaging and quality of the extras on  these Blu-Ray discs.

I originally reported a problem with content on the Blu-Ray collection I purchased from Amazon: Celebrating The 50th Anniversary Blu-Ray Star Trek The Original Motion Picture Collection (UPC 32429 23903). This is a revised review (up to 2 stars from 1).

Many of the extras fail to load without restarting (power off/on) my Blu-Ray player. My Oppo BDP 103d Blu-Ray players firmware is up-to-date and there are no issues with viewing the movie or SOME of the extra features. I have not yet attempted to view every possible extra feature (commentary tracks, for example). However I can say with certainty that many of the extras segments will not play without multiple attempts. (I have never had problems with other Blu-Ray discs and this player. This is something new and unique to the Star Trek films).

I also notice that it takes a very long time to load from disc insert to the main menu. Is there something unique about the encryption or Java programming on these discs? Is this a known problem and these movie collections are being sold without testing all of their content? Does the  Celebrating The 50th Anniversary Blu-Ray Star Trek: The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection also contain the same kind of missing content? Who knows? I sent an e-mail to Paramount's customer service, but (of course) never receive a reply.

Paramount could do one thing to improve their Trek content. Turn over the creation, distribution, and mastering of the content to fans who love the series. It really would be that simple.",1483056000,,1689,4.767123287671233

Not to fear! After much Googling and separating out the original 2009 reviews and finding a single, lone review of the 2016 version, I can confirm these films are complete with extras, although the set is missing a bonus disc that was included in the 2009 set. That disc contained ""The Captain's Summit"" which is available in full on YouTube.

So if what you're buying has the lovely painted white cover, then yes, there are mostly the same extras here as on the 2009 non 50th Anniversary set, and the lone exception is easily replaceable.",1479513600,6,800,4.7898550724637685

The pros: the colour is really good and the sound effects stunning.  Sadly......

The cons: The sound effects are so good more often than not you can't hear the dialog. When you can, the quality of the voices is good as well. But as I say, that's not often and at a critical part in Star Trek the Motion Picture, it got so bad I couldn't even follow the plot. Finally gave up and turned it off.

The other thing that's quite odd is the intro. There is more than a minute at the beginning where the music plays and the screen is totally dark. I kept switching players thinking there was something wrong with them. Nope, the movie doesn't actually start until Scene 2. I sure don't remember that from the theatre and maybe they have corrective work they can do on sound (it said it is the theatre version). But I don't and it did not make for a happy viewing experience.

All-in-all I'm very disappointed. I don't normally pay this much for a set of movies and for the price being charged, I expected a really good product.",1466899200,,1249,4.271186440677966

the sacrifice of colleague and friend 'Mr Spock'
His coffin had been ejected from the ship and now lies on the surface of the
newly created planet of 'Genesis'
S.S Enterprise has returned to earth, a alert sounds indicating an intruder has
entered 'Spock's' cabin, when investigated 'Kirk' finds 'Bones' who appears to
be asking for help with 'Spock's' voice.
'Spock's' father has arrived on earth to speak to 'Kirk' wanting to know why his
son was left on Genesis, why wasn't his living soul taken to Vulcan.
The search begins.....
The new planet has aroused the interest of a 'Klingon' officer.....'Kirk's' new
found son 'David' is on 'Genesis' responding to a life-form signature being
detected on the planet's surface.
'David' of course was instrumental in the creation of the 'Genesis' machine that
had created the Planet.
'Kirk' and his crew are on the way, however, the 'Klingons' have got there ahead
of the 'Enterpise' crew.
'Kirk' and his loyal crew are not on a sanctioned mission, in fact, they have been
told soon after their return to Earth that the 'Enterpise' was to be de-commissioned.
However 'Kirk' and his crew members have risked their careers to search for their
friend, it is, for them, an absolute priority that out-weighs the will of the Federation.
A confrontation with the 'Klingons' was not on the agenda however, though perhaps
inevitable.
Another superb Sci-fi adventure with the original cast of the much loved TV series
brought to the big screen in this the third in the series.
For it's time the Special-effects are pretty impressive, again the upgrade to the HD
format for this 1984 Sci-fi adventure is pretty good.

3783399,4,B001S3GDT0,"when you've known about something your whole life, it can be hard to believe it had to scratch & claw it's way into that prominence. i was born in the '70s, so it often feels to me like, say, Shakespeare or The Beatles are phenomena of Nature, created around the same time and by the same forces as the sun and the trees. while i can understand intellectually that this couldn't of been the case, there's still an emotional part of me to which it doesn't ""feel"" right.
in an age when science-fiction owns much of the cinema and/or airwaves, you might never imagine what an uphill battle Star Trek had. limping along for three seasons and qualifying as a ""hit"" only in syndicated reruns, it proved the all-time example of the unorthodox series which needs time to build a fanbase. and even after that was achieved, a hoped-for relaunch had it's own obstacle course to get through. and even when they reached it, said relaunch should of been, by any logical standard, as ignominious a final nail as was ever nailed into a coffin.
Star Trek: The Motion Picture is one of cinema's all-time lines in the sand. on the one hand it offers some breathtaking visual effects that've never been quite duplicated, my favorite being the early scene on Vulcan. to say nothing of it's fair share of good character moments. after all, any quality series depends upon it's characters (even more so than the writing, i sometimes think), and the rich, bristling chemistry established a decade or so before is plenty palpable.
but alas, not even many of the ""Trekkies"" who defend it would likely call it their favorite. the major strike against it is that, said character moments aside, it doesn't really feel much like Star Trek. where the classic series (and the films to come) always complimented it's philosophical lessons with razzle-dazzle fun on the order of Flash Gordon or Star Wars, this film emphasizes the cold emptiness of space akin to (easily the single most overrated science-fiction film of all time) 2001: A Space Odyssey. the warmth of the classic series got lost somewhere, and too much of the film just meanders.
nor does it help matters much that the plot borrows none too subtly from one of the better tv episodes, ""The Changeling,"" in which a probe called Nomad has gotten it wires crossed in the way V'Ger/Voyager has here. it's detractors tend to sum the film up as ""where Nomad has gone before.""
but fortunately the film was enough of a hit to justify a leap of faith on Paramount's part. this time, much more attention would be paid to the established tone and spirit of old.
Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan improves upon it's shaky predecessor by the proverbial leaps an' bounds. so much so, in fact, that the misconception that it was the pinnacle of the film series lingers to this day. you need to bear in mind that people were no doubt awed and impressed that the formula wasn't so stale as it had seemed in the first film after all. it's certainly a Trek milestone, in that it took a beloved but floundering franchise and got it back on track. that much credit is certainly due, but let's not get carried away here.
anyone who's resisted the peer pressure and actually evaluated these films for themselves can tell you that the best of the movies, indeed the pinnacle of all things Trek, is First Contact. this gibberish to the contrary doesn't even make sense: how could Wrath possibly be the greatest Star Trek film ever made when it's NOT EVEN THE BEST OF THE KIRK & SPOCK MOVIES?
not by a long shot!
it certainly has much to recommend it. not least of which numerous good character moments and the ultimate ""death"" of Spock which, by some miracle, is not in the least diluted of poignancy by the fact that everyone knew he'd find a way back even then. but it does have a weakness, indeed the single deadliest weakness such a film could ever contract.
the action-adventure angle of a film is only as good as it's villain, and alas, Khan is NOT a great villain. between the messiah complex, the proclivity for torture, the obsessive vendetta against our hero, and the tendency to throw temper-tantrums when things don't go his way, let's face it, Khan is about as generic, paper-thin, cliche' a villain as you could possibly get. what is he, really, that precedents ranging from The Artful Dodger to Professor Moriarty, from Hitler to Darth Vader, hadn't already been? Khan is strait off the rack, pure an' simple.
what really sucks, though, is that he's a waste of a distinguished great actor. it's a bummer that Ricardo Montalban is reduced to chewing the scenery left and right, but he's given so little to work with that that's pretty much all he can do.
in a technical sense, the film's biggest mistake is Khan's downfall, or lack thereof. sometimes i get kinda sick of villains dying. apart from the obvious cliche aspect, it occurs to me that they might be getting off a little easy. a villain's downfall is most effective, even poetic, when we see them humbled by it. a villain who lives will have days ahead, maybe even a lifetime, to deal with that. but sadly, Khan is given no such moment of contrition, in fact no reaction at all. his ship just explodes with no cutaway into it first. so not only is Khan spared any psychological ramifications of his failure, he may well of died not realizing he had failed!
but i repeat, Khan is the one blemish on an otherwise exemplary film.
Star Trek III: The Search For Spock could've been a bit of a mess, as it represents a lateral shift from space-opera to mythology and mysticism, but somehow it feels natural and seamless. Leonard Nimoy, in his first change to direct a feature film, proves more than qualified to helm this exercise in Vulcan mysticism. one of the most fondly remembered aspects of the series, the love/hate relationship between Spock and McCoy, was never more awkward than when it turned out Spock had implanted his soul into McCoy before ""dying."" seriously, how can you not love McCoy's futile attempt at a neck-pinch, for instance, or crossed-signal lines like ""where's the logic in offerin' me a ride home, you idiot?""
on a more influential note, this film did much to reinvigorate the Klingons. it is here that we first hear bit of the Klingon language, for instance, and first see full Klingon regalia as seen in The Next Generation and beyond. and certainly an actor of Christopher Lloyd's caliber is gonna make for a formidable nemesis. Lloyd takes a character that could easily of been as generic as Khan and doesn't simply make it work, he brings a new sense of identity to the Klingon race itself. (that's certainly as impressive an achievement as his his DeLorean time machine, isn't it?)
also, i much prefer Robin Curtis' Saavik to Kirstie Alley's. even if Curtis hadn't been more believably Vulcan-esque in bearing, even if she hadn't bought a graceful gravity which her predecessor sorely lacked, she's still WAY sexier.
the film worked out well, squelching any doubts anyone might've had about Nimoy's directorial abilities. offered the next one and asked for ""your version of Star Trek,"" Nimoy delivered not simply the very best of the original Enterprise crew's film adventures, but quite possibly the pinnacle of said crew's endeavors in general. rarely has the concept's moral compass and penchant for the philosophical been as poignantly, touchingly delivered as in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.
what with it's premise of recovering the extinct species of humpback whales and it's pointed criticism of a world that would hunt them into extinction, you'd think this film would be somewhat preachy. well, i guess technically it is, but it manages to preach without feeling like it's preaching. contemporary Earth is seen as having wise hearts who see the danger as well as such shortsighted folks as whalers. and while said whalers are the closest thing this film has to a villain, no attempt is made to exaggerate their motives into something more sinister than the fact that this is how they make their living. they simply don't know any better, that's all.
for a nice bonus the film displays - usually in the form of the crew's attempts decipher this unfamiliar culture - a broad sense of humor there hadn't been room for until now. not that the first three films don't have their lighter, whimsical moments, but darker plot elements couldn't help but overshadow them. much as everyone seems to love ""The Trouble With Tribbles,"" it wasn't really until The Voyage Home that Star Trek in general had tried to recapture that giddy spirit. it's something they really should've tried more often.
but giddy or not, we have an important crisis to deal with here. and the seemingly disparate elements don't feel in the least like the tightrope they must've been. every single thing about The Voyage Home works. sci-fi is often at it's best when it has something to say, and while numerous tv episodes meet this criterion, this is really the only Star Trek movie that does.
but alas, that does bring us to what is usually considered the weakest link in this cinematic chain. as directed by William Shatner, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier remains one of the most vulnerable chinks in the armor of all things Trek. it's not quite so horrible as it's been made out to be. like the first film, it's primary saving grace is more than a few good character moments. and it's certainly as workmanlike as a film can get on all the technical fronts.
and besides, let's face it: any film short of Casablanca or The Godfather would've fallen short, had it been the follow-up to The Voyage Home.
what hampers the film is it's singularly ludicrous central plot: the Enterprise is shanghaied by a cult leader of the Jim Jones or David Koresch variety and his followers for a trip to the home of God...which they seem to actually find.
as it happens, this reflects something Gene Roddenberry had been failing miserably to do since the beginning. there were often characters with Godlike powers, Q and the like, and Roddenberry frequently tried to get an episode produced in which God Himself would figure. for obvious reasons, of believability as well as controversy, he was blocked at every turn. the closest he came was an episode of the animated series, ""The Magicks Of Megas-Tu,"" in which the crew meet the Devil. and even then it wasn't really the Devil per se, so much as an old acquaintance of Earth who had inspired storybook depictions of the man downstairs. a William Randolph Heart to Satan's Charles Foster Kane, if you will.
the sheer absurdity of the premise can't help but overshadow the film, but we should at least give Shatner credit for knowing not to do what would've most emphasized said absurdity: ""God"" turns out to in fact be an alien masquerading as The Big Fella. granted, that can't salvage the film completely, but it does keep it from reaching a whole 'nother level of dumb.
(so is Star Trek: The Motion Picture or The Final Frontier the series' low-water mark? for my money, Frontier is the better of the two films, if only because it gets to the point.)
again beating the odds, they got the chance to do another film and the result justified the leap of faith. Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is, next to The Voyage Home, the best of Kirk and Co.'s movie adventures. acknowledging that the aging cast had only so much juice left, they fashioned a resounding finale which enabled them to go out with a bang.
the plot, dealing with the Federation's first attempt to make peace with the Klingons, is a profound and bittersweet commentary on the fact that things change. we see the beginnings of the version of Klingon society represented by Worf on TNG. the film even goes so far as to cast Michael Dorn as one of his ancestors.
due to a Chernobyl-type disaster, the Klingons face extinction and, with few other options, turn to the Federation for help. David Warner, usually one of cinema's most chilling villains, is surprisingly touching as the Klingon ambassador who welcomes this peace. brief as his appearance is, one suspects this rich character more than made up for the flimsy, inconsequential role he'd played in the previous film.
(by an interesting twist of Fate, the film reunited Warner with Nicholas Meyer, director of his finest screen hour, Time After Time.) (in which Warner was Jack The Ripper, no less.)
inevitably, there are those who don't share the ambassador's enthusiasm, and his assassination kicks off a cosmic mystery on the order of The Manchurian Candidate. it's a truly significant final problem to solve, giving the characters ample opportunity to do what they do best. if only everyone's ""last hurrah"" could be such a triumph.
the best series is hands-down the adventures of Picard, Riker, and Data, but it did take the cinematic revival of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy to make The Next Generation a viable possibility. the first two Trek crews are two of the most engagingly charismatic ensembles in television history, so let's give them both their due, huh?
if only there'd never been a Deep Space 9 to spoil that record...",1460073600,,13075,4.735087719298246

3783412,5,B001S3GDT0,"This is all six Star Trek movies (in their theatrical versions) featuring the original cast, packed into one slim case with each blu-ray on its own flap.

Most of the complaints you see here are because these are the exact same blu-rays they've been selling since 2009, packaged into the other Blu-ray collections (like the Stardate Collection). The biggest difference I see here is a.) there is no bonus seventh disk of special features and b.) it's somewhat cheaper than those older collections, probably as a result. If you already own those, there is absolutely no reason to buy this one. I didn't, so this is a great set for me.

The Blu-Rays are good quality and play well; they show off the movies in all their glory. Picture is good, sound is good... I have neither the time nor the interest in making comparisons to the presentations of other releases.

The biggest failings I can see is that... yeah, as a 50th anniversary special, it is a bit of a failing that this set is LESS than the ones that came before. No new features; some features REMOVED. And yes, these are the theatrical versions of the movies, not the director's cuts. Paramount still haven't scanned and remastered those. I'm slightly less bothered by that though.
Star Trek: The Motion Picture's director's cut used new CGI shots rendered at DVD resolution, for that DVD release; then Foundation Imaging went bankrupt and the source files are lost. So, Paramount would have to shell out even MORE money to redo it AGAIN, or have potentially noticeable drops in quality whenever the picture changes to upscaled DVD-resolution inserts.
Star Trek V: The Final Frontier never got a Director's cut. It's the worst of the bunch anyway, though I admit some curiosity about what the final act might have looked like if the production hadn't completely run out of time and money and had to resort to ""California... but pink!"" for the mystical alien planet, and a really abbreviated ending.
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is (apparently) better paced in the theatrical cut than the director's cut.
We're still missing out on expanded versions of the best three movies (2-4), though. It really does seem like Paramount has no intention of releasing those, though.",1456358400,13,2237,4.850785340314136

If one doesn't have these on blu-ray then this set might be nice to have. However, for those waiting for the extended versions one will still have to wait.

The playing times for the movies are as follows: I-131min,II-112min,III-105min,IV-118min,V-106min,VI-113min. Evidently, only the second movie, The Wrath of Khan, was fully restored in high definition, while the others were merely digitally remastered. All of the other films look fine and apparently didn't need any restoration.",1455667200,35,986,4.975757575757576

3783420,4,B001S3GDT0,"I'm an avid Star Trek fan, but don't own physical copies of any of the films. I decided to purchase this when it was launched and I enjoy having all six original films on Blu-Ray. The films themselves look and sound great.

There is a dearth of bonus features, but at this price point (I preordered and received a good deal) I wasn't expecting much. I only wish the director's cut of Wrath of Khan was included.",1455667200,6,411,4.337662337662338

3783424,1,B001S3GDT0,"I was so excited when I got this that instead of going direct to the menu and starting the movie I decide to watch the trailers hoping i would see a new trailer for the up coming movie. That's when I realized I had been duped! The first trailer was for the the new Kahn movie. Which was released several years ago. They did nothing new for the 50th Anniversary. No new content, no new remastering just a repackage blu-Ray set from a few years ago.",1454976000,11,447,4.209302325581396
3783425,5,B001S3GDT0,"This is a great package to replace your old V.H.S's to D.V.D.!!!  I chose this over the Blue Ray option because it was cheaper & still plays in Blue Ray players as well  as D.V.D. players of course allowing everyone in the house hold the opportunity to watch these now classic movies at their leisure.  It is also a great way for younger fans to add this nicely packaged set of great movies to their collection.  growing up in the 70's the T.V. was still regularly airing the rerun's of the original Star Trek series  so this is the Enterprise crew I grew up with.  To me its surprising that it took the success of Star Wars to prompt the production of the big screen version of Star Trek.  But the bonus video offered in this pack explains all that stuff.  Personally I think the picture & sound quality of these films are great!  In the Sci- Fi genre there seems to be a division of fans ""Trekkies"" & ""Star Wars"" fans...I love them both!!!",1454630400,3,941,4.331428571428572

3783435,5,B001S3GDT0,thanks,1453939200,,6,6.0
3783436,5,B001S3GDT0,"This is a fantastic collection.  I'm coming from the original DVD releases of the movies which, except for TMP, were just laserdisc transfers with somewhat crappy video, washed out colors and OK sound.  (though, they were still better than the old VHS tapes)  Those releases also had no special features, except TMP, which was the special Director's Edition and full of features.

As far as I'm concerned, Blu-Ray is the best thing to happen to these films.  Each movie is beautifully remastered in 1080p with wonderful 7.1 audio.  Sure, they're the theatrical cuts, but that doesn't bother me.  I actually didn't see any of these movies in the theater because I was quite young when most of them were released, so it's nice seeing them as audiences saw them in their release years.  The only one where I feel like I'm missing anything is Star Trek VI, since the home video version was always 3 minutes longer than the theatrical cut, but I got over it quickly.  The crisp video, vibrant colors and wonderful sound of the movies more than made up for any disappointment.  I won't go into long reviews of the films themselves, but suffice to say that I'm a Trekkie and these are six of my favorite movies on the planet.  The collection itself comes in a nice, sturdy box that's constructed of thick cardboard, not the usual thin cardboard you tend to get with box sets.  On the front of the box is a nice hologram in the shape of the Starfleet logo that pictures do not do justice.  It also has a plastic cover that goes over it, which has the names of the movies on it.  The movies themselves are in thin cases, which I very much prefer to those fancy (and overrated) fold-out deals.  Each case has wonderful box art, a light image of one of the cast members on the front and info about the movie on the back.  Though, I suspect some of the info is copy and paste, especially given that the Star Trek VI cover lists the length at 113 minutes, which is the previous home video length.  The included theatrical cut runs at 110 minutes.  But, that's a small discrepancy.  The movies are also loaded with special features, which we were missing in the original DVD releases.  I know they were included in later releases, but I can't afford to go buy new versions of movies every time they come out.

All said, this is a fantastic collection. I'm glad I was finally able to make the leap to Blu-Ray for these films, they are worth the price.",1453939200,10,2436,4.490909090909091

3783439,4,B001S3GDT0,"As many others pointed out already, the transfer was great.  The picture was better than the DVD's as was the sound.  The only reason I refuse to give this 5 stars is because its the theatrical version of the films, and for a bluray release not to have the added scenes from Star Trek II: The wrath of Khan, which better explains the plot with the deleted scenes included was a huge mistake.  I really wish they would put out the directors cut of Wrath of Khan on Bluray, as I can't stand watching the theatrical version.",1453852800,,521,4.350515463917525

3783528,4,B001S3GDT0,I've been a Trekkie probably longer than most of the people reading this have been alive best qualityand I had to wait years for them to put this this package together but I'm very happy,1437868800,,186,4.3428571428571425
3783529,4,B001S3GDT0,"This collection is excellently made. The packaging is high quality, and probably won't break unless you attack it with a Bat'leth. Now on to the movies.

Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Also known as The Motionless Picture and The Motion Sickness, this movie is best summed up by the first two minuets. That would be two minuets of excellent score music and a blank black screen. This movie has special effects!! And nothing else!!!! In all seriousness, this seems like a dull 50 minuet episode stretched out to over two hours. The movie basically consists over the occasional plot related scene, the frequent boring non-critical scene, and lot and lots of establishing shots. The most painful moment in the movie is when the Enterprise is first investigating the mystery threatening earth, and it keeps showing shots of the Enterprise flying through blue space clouds!!! Congratulations, you just made an important, tense scene boring! This is easily the worst movie on the collection. The only good things here are good special effects for the time and acceptable acting, just with a horrid script.

The Wrath Of Khan. Easily the best Star Trek movie ever. Enough has been said by others, so I don't have to go into detail. Just know that this movie has it all, great special effects, acting, plot, humor, and terror.

The Search For Spok. In one word: dull. This one feels like a made for TV movie. Acting was acceptable, as were the special effects. Plot had an interesting premise, but was handled all clunky. Nothing really horrid going on here, but nothing great either. I watched it once, and have no real desire to see it again.

The Journey Home. A truly and surprisingly excellent movie. The plot is extremely cheesy, and this works wonders for it, rather than against it. Its funny, its endearing, and its great. There are plot holes, but this is not a particularly serious movie, so they are forgivable. Everyone's acting is great, as is the rest of the movie.

The Final Frontier. Uhhh, this one defies classification. I know that it is bad, but I really cannot think of ways to describe it more. Everything about this one could be either so bad its good, or so bad its horrible. Everyone hears about how bad this one is, but I found it more baffling than outright horrible. The only sure feeling I have for this one is that it is bad.

The Undiscovered Country. Another very good movie. Not as good as 2 or 4, but still good. The plot is fun and engaging, and serves as a perfect bridge to The Next Generation. The acting and special effects are very good for the most part. The only true complaint is about a major plot point.

SPOILER ALERT!!!!!

I cannot comprehend why the federation is involved in the anti-peace conspiracy.

END OF SPOILERS!!!!

I give this collection 4 stars because there are some really excellent movies in here, and some truly horrendous piles of crud in here as well. The good outweighs the bad by a significant margin, however.",1437782400,,2970,4.705202312138728

3783542,5,B001S3GDT0,"I love these movies, and I'm  not even familiar with the show.  One can watch these movies and figure out who is who.  Honestly, I got these because of Seinfeld.  In episode one of season eight there is a running gag of which movie is better in this series, Wrath of Kahn and Search for Spock, in particular.  The jokes were funny, but I wanted to see the movies to better understand the gags.

The widescreen, good, picture, good, features, insightful.  To me, this series has attempted to tackle philosophical concepts by way of believable science fiction.  If you do not like this collection, I would find that offensive and illogical.  But then again, we're all human.",1435968000,,672,4.6752136752136755

It was during TMP when they did the long pans of the Enterprise and she thought it was ultramodern CGI.  I pointed out it was too clear to be CGI, that it was a model.  The remastering of these movies is spectacular, there are colors and details that I didn't remember being there from when I watched them from VHS tapes on an old 15"" CRT tv with bad color.

Oh, and TMP was a movie written just as an excuse to do long pan shots of a ship model btw.",1411084800,,625,3.9206349206349205

Earlier DVD versions, however, featured superior directors cuts of ""Undiscovered Country"" ""Wrath of Khan"" and a vastly improved cut of ""The Motion Picture."" It is my understanding  that those versions were not mastered in HD, which would require Paramount to start from scratch if they want to sell them on Blu-ray. Then again, why can't they? They've meticulously remastered all the seasons of ""The Next Generation,"" which was never mastered on an HD medium to begin with. Why not the whole movie collection?

Even though it was kind of weak, The Search for Spock, was still fun to watch.  The weakest was V, The Final Frontier.  It should have been called All About Shatner. Don't get me wrong though, I am truly and totally enamored with Shatner. From his first appearance on the first episode of the original series he brings every bit of himself and his unique and hilarious sense of humor to the part of Captain Kirk.  The Final Frontier, All About Shatner (no surprise since he directed it), actually does have its endearing moments, though possibly unintended.  Who, knowing these characters as intimately as most of us ""trekkie"" followers do, couldn't be highly entertained and enchanted with the scene with Kirk, Bones and Spock singing ""Michael Row the Boat Ashore"" 'round the campfire?",1404345600,,901,4.818181818181818

Point of order: jury is still out on whether movies 1 and 2 are the extended editions, which means you should still hold on to those dvds as there are extra scenes and BTS material not ported to blu-ray. But that's a small price to pay for pristine 7.1 audio versions of 30 yr old movies. My only problem: watching the classics in their intelligent and action-packed delivery (except for you, #5) makes me dislike the reboots no matter how much lens flare and action.

3783913,3,B001S3GDT0,"This seven-disc blu-ray set can be very tantalizing when you're looking at it. Then you take it out of the gorgeous, space-saving packaging and pop the discs one by one into your blu-ray player and you ask yourself, ""I had all these on DVD, why did I just buy this?""

First the pros. The picture quality is good. Not a tremendous improvement over the DVDs, but still much smoother and the colors are a bit deeper. Most of the top-notch extras from the 2001-2004 series of two-disc collector's edition DVDs are here (though most of TMP's 2001 extras are missing, as are all of the insightful text commentaries by Michael and Denise Okuda), with some fascinating new material on top of that. And the movies all come in slim single cases, taking up far less room than those clunky old DVDs. The best ""new"" material (remember that at this point, this set is about five years old) is ""The Captains' Summit,"" an often hilarious and always riveting roundtable with Shatner, Nimoy, Stewart, and Frakes reminiscing and harrassing each other (all in good fun), joined by host Whoopi Goldberg. All Trek fans should see it.

""Connnnnnnnn! Connnnnnn!"" (Sorry. I had to.) I can understand the desire to release the original theatrical cuts, but who says those cuts are definitive? ""Wrath of Khan"" was obviously a great movie from the beginning, but I find it suffers without some of the content specific to the Director's Cut (particularly in relation to Scott's nephew). The Director's Cut of ""Motion Picture"" is obviously not perfect (you can't unbreak a broken plate), but it was generally better paced and less awkward in some crudely-edited scenes. And has ""The Undiscovered Country"" ever been released on home video in its theatrical version before? Since its first release on VHS it's been three minutes longer. On the 2004 DVD, Nicholas Meyer added two ""scene revisions""--basically character-identifying cutaways that weren't necessary if you were paying attention to the plot--that I definitely don't miss, but surely the original home video version would have been a better option. At the very least, they could have released multiple blu-ray editions as single items--the one thing Paramount should know about ""Trek"" fans by now is that if there's a new edition out, it doesn't matter how much it costs or how poorly it's packaged, we'll buy it.

All in all, these six movies together are still a cornerstone of the Trek fan's video library. But this blu-ray set falls a little short of what we already had in a ""lesser"" format. If you've got a blu-ray player, your DVDs will look a little better in there anyway. So if you're like me, don't bother with the upgrade (but do try to get your hands on the ""Summit"" somehow). If you're not, well, hey, different strokes and all that. Live long and prosper.",1403827200,,2799,4.851464435146443

Before I close I would like to give all a heads up so to speak. Blu-Ray is of course the max in viewing entertainment but there may be something people do not think about and thats the fine print that we over look when buying or renting Blu-ray.
When doing so, make sure the Blu-ray quality is stated on the package somewhere. Blu-Rays can be 1080p, 720p or 480p.
I rented a Blu-ray the other day and it was in 480p. This Star Trek is 1080p so I did all the work for you.  Be as smart as they are, read the whole description on it. Have a nice day and all is excellent on this particular Star Trek collectors set.

I am a firm believer in the every other theory for these movies.  The odd numbered ones all seemed to miss the mark.  And V.  We will pretend that one just didn't happen.  Yeah I know and understand the whole idea of if you travel space long enough you will eventually meet God of some sort.  But this story, the script, the acting, the whole thing just failed in my opinion.  So if I rated the movies independently, I figure the 4 stars I used would be about the average lol.

I - was beautiful and ground breaking for its time, to me is an okay movie and gets boring at some points.
II - KHAAAAAAAAN!  Can't go wrong there
III - okay, can take it or leave it
IV - one of my favorites.  ALWAYS a fan of the fish out of water type of treatment, and this one did it superbly.
V - wretched
VI - my other favorite, great story, great acting, solid effects

What a way to describe a movie/television series. For years I have wanted to own a copy of the movies and finally I was able to purchase a copy for myself to watch whenever I wished too. Upon opening the package, I noticed that the individual cases were slimmer than the normal DVD case, but none the less, this just made the entire series fit within the Larger display box. I have not had a chance to watch ANY of the DVD's, yet, but if a problem arises, I will update this review. Otherwise, the DVD's appear to be in New Condition and the whole package is as described.

The box set is packaged tightly and looks good on a shelf if you're the kind of person who likes displaying your collection.  Overall, the film quality looks AMAZING on Blu-ray, especially the earlier films like The Motion Picture and Wrath of Khan.

Sound is great, but I viewed these discs on a standard audio setup with no surround sound.  Still, everything was crisp and clear and there were no muddy sections in the audio.

My only gripe is that there is a plastic sleeve that fits around the box set itself.  Looks great, but it's slightly too tight.  I've nicked up the corner on the box itself (cardboard) while taking the sleeve on and off.  But the quality of the films is amazing, especially for a Trek fan like me.  If you're a nut about displaying your collection (I'm not) then just take a little care when removing the sleeve, but otherwise it's a fantastic value.

We also ordered a motorcycle helmet shield and it was placed in the same box as the movies.  That was a bit disheartening.  Helmet shields are easily scratched and/or broken.

Normally, I toss the cases of my DVD's and Bluray's. With this, I couldn't. They need their special cases:) If you know the movies, you know what you're getting. I can't say enough about 1, 2 and 6. Those are my favs. 1 was the most sci-fi in my opinion. And I loved the score, as they were traveling through the cloud. 2 is probably everyone's favorite. And I can't fault them with that. It also had some of the earliest CG animation an audience had seen. 6 was just cool. As for the others, meh. The best part in 3 was when they were in the process of stealing the Enterprise. 4 was cool b/c I was a kid and saw it in the theater. And I miss being a kid. 5 was okay just because it was odd. You got a little insight into some of the characters too.

If you're a fan, you probably already have this. If not, it's sort of a must-buy, along with the TNG companion.

As for the bonus disc, obvious shot before HD cameras were around. It's 480p up sampled to 1080p. And it shows. PQ aside, it was fun to watch.",1391385600,,1080,4.084905660377358

The down side is the packaging needs to go back to the drawing board to be re-worked, the plastic sleeve is hard to get off and back on again with the cardboard piece that is with it, and the printing needs to be on the outside of the box and not on the sleeve, also leave the dvd's accessible without taking the sleeve off each time.",1390089600,,385,4.078947368421052

Using Star Trek characters names, the Summit is a 3-part round table discussion where Guinan hosts and interviews Kirk, Spock, Picard and Riker. Yup! Captain's and number 1's from 2 series' and 10 movies, all at the same table. And Whoopi does great job with piercing questions that keep the whole thing fascinating and moving. Even a little TOS/Next Gen rivalry pops up at times. A MUST SEE for every Trek fan.",1390089600,,525,4.706521739130435

3784029,5,B001S3GDT0,"DVD's arrived brand new and in good time. Set includes all six original movies and an extra DVD with Interviews which I didn't find very good as the cast joked for much of the time and didn't seem to recall any content of any Star Trek movies they did. The features on each Movie disk are far better, ranging from Interviews about the Special FX, to Star fleet info about the mission. The features are definitely worth watching in addition to the movies. Paramount actually did a good job with these, except for the harassing commercial messages about the now redundant Blu-Ray format.

Since I have abandoned Blu-Ray and gone back to DVD via an Upscaling DVD player, I only buy DVD now. A lot of ""Plants"" are here on Amazon these days trying to boost failing Blu-Ray sales. Sony has even started to manipulate the numbers of Blu-Ray sales by including a DVD with the Blu-Ray; counting as a 100% Blu-Ray sale even though people are buying it simply because it's the only way to get some DVD's. Sony has even gone as far as to partially lock their Wiki page to prevent actual numbers that reflect things like DVD outselling Blu-Ray 3 to 1.

DVD for me from now on, with my HD TV service. No more worrying about if Sony's DRM servers are down, if I need a Firmware update or what the NSA is accessing on my Blu-Ray player. Blu-Ray is already replaced for may people via Streaming services like Amazon's.",1389744000,2,1401,4.490196078431373

I decided to buy this one so we could watch the old movies, which are my favorite part of Star Trek, and for her to discover some of the old movies (she came into Star Trek with The Next Generation)

I went with the DVD version just for price sake, and knowing that these are old movies, I was afraid that a transfer to Blu Ray may actually look weird. After watching all movies, I really don't care if they are not Blu Ray, they look great and sound great.

The remastering of these movies is pretty well done. The colors look fantastic, very vivid and bright.

The extras are magnificent, specially the Captain's Summit, that special is just amazing and we loved watching it. It was like the best topping ever to a good ice cream.

3784098,4,B001S3GDT0,"Not a very good restoration. Some parts of Star Trek the motion picture show that the master it came from has some wear.
The VHS my mother got back in the 1980's is cleaner as it was transferred from the master soon after the movie left the theaters.
The newer the movie the less wear to the point where the master has not enough wear to show up.
The Captains summit is a nice attention. However it's not so much a captains summit as it is just William Shatner with Leonard Nemoy (Of TOS) and Patrick stewart with Jonathan franks of TNG. None of the other captains however as this box set only represents the movies starting ToS crew so the absence is justified as is the fact that it's whoopi goldberg doing the interviews so she's focused on the people she knew. The star trek she grew up with and the star trek she acted in.",1385078400,2,827,4.273885350318471

I didn't even remember that the ""missing"" scenes were never there in the theatrical cuts.  The director's cuts were much better.  Little innocuous scenes here and there didn't necessarily drive the story, but helped eke out a little more character development which is never a bad thing in Trek films.",1384041600,2,414,4.9

These movies are terrible, and yet, wonderful.  Wrath of Khan holds up surprisingly well - not the effects (look out for the puppet-brain-worms!), but the storyline is nicely put together.  And I totally didn't remember that the fanfare for the first movie later became the theme for Next Generation.

3784128,5,B001S3GDT0,This set will cost a lot more if bought elsewhere. Good there is Amazon that we can depend on. The packaging is very accessible better than other which are bulky.,1383436800,,162,4.433333333333334
3784129,4,B001S3GDT0,"I am really impressed with the Blu-ray quality of these movies. The upgraded (Blu-ray transfer) picture quality is amazing. The detail and space scenes are truly outstanding. And to hear them in Dolby HD sound makes it really feel like I'm flying around right in the Enterprise. And, of course, the movies (most) are really well written and directed. I am a Trekky.

The packaging is nice with each movie in its own slim-line DVD case. They are rather tight in the cardboard box holder...it's like trying to get ketchup out of the bottle.

I wish this set included the Director's Cut and I don't like that there are previews before the movie. Otherwise, along with the extras, this is a 5 star collection.

Overall, for $30.00, I am very happy to have this set in my Blu-ray/DVD library.",1383436800,2,787,4.64748201438849

The bonus features on each film are a real plus and the dvd of Whoopi Goldberg interviewing William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart, and Jonathan Frakes is not to be missed.",1381968000,,346,4.476190476190476

It is a good gift for any Star Trek fan. I bought this for my father on Father's Day, but I get more use out of it because I actually remember that we have the set.
My only complaint is that the fourth movie was not that good. Unless Free Willy was your favorite movie of all time, you will be just fine if you skip the fourth movie.",1381708800,,473,4.1521739130434785

I also purchased the Star Trek Next Generation Motion Picture Collection, and the two newest Star Trek movies, which are actually pre-quels. The newest movies are his favorites, but he has really enjoyed having the entire collection and I'm sure these are movies he will enjoy watching again and again. He's already watched all of them at least twice, some already three times - and we've only had them a few months!

Each DVD is in a slim jewel case & is labelled.  There are no liner notes - do you really need them ?  The box has a lovely emblem as pictured that is actually a 3D lenticular lens - an unexpected & wonderful bonus.  If you are thinking about buying these DVDs, you are already a fan & I don't need to convince you.  I bought this boxed set on the occasion of the NASA announcement that V-ger had indeed left our solar system.

I recall the first movie as a lot more interesting when I was young; this time I will sum it up as a whole lot of watching characters stare at the main view screen as the Enterprise slowly, painfully, crawls through a giant glowy cloud.  I enjoyed Wrath of Khan, especially after watching the ""prequels"" - the old TV episode, and JJ Abrahm's new take in Star Trek Into Darkness.

I will sum it up by saying: At least I bought it on sale as an Amazon Daily Deal; otherwise I might have felt cheated - the movies just weren't as good as I remembered them.",1381190400,,671,4.153846153846154

I am glad to have had the opportunity to upgrade from my VHS set and thank Amazon for making this collection the deal of the day.

Shatner shows different sides of Kirk and you will understand why the Trekkies wanted to know more about him. Leonard Nimoy portrays Science Officer Spock. A Vulcan that knows nothing about humans and understands nothing but pure logic. The words Illogical became synonymous with Spock,with his pointed ears and logic helped Kirk vanquish quite a few enemies.

Speaking of extras, I watched an ILM documentary on the ST III disc and that was a lot of fun.

There's plenty here to geek out with for weeks to come.  I'm watching the movies out of order and I'm saving the best for last (...you know which one that is....).  And when I'm done I can watch them all again with the commentary on :)

I picked up this set as I had never seen all the TOS films in order from start to finish and held a marathon the week after I bought it and loved it!  When you watch them all back to back you really appreciate how they flowed from one film to another in this arc the writers of each film carried across all 6 films.  You won't be disappointed by the quality.",1380585600,,476,4.266666666666667

It is clear, sounds great and high quality. I wasn't too crazy about TOS, but the movies with TOS cast are fantastic and what I imagine the TOS would have been like with a budget. Certainly a great buy for any fan that doesn't already have them.",1378339200,,389,4.416666666666667
3784253,5,B001S3GDT0,These movies are really worth having. I liked each movie for different reasons and thought that 2 - 4 were especially good although I enjoyed each of them very much.,1378252800,,165,4.533333333333333
3784254,3,B001S3GDT0,"I've been a fan since the 80s and have thoroughly enjoyed in their VHS, and DVD formats, which I both bought.  So when the Blu-ray HD version came out,  I knew I'd buy it...eventually.  When it finally came down to the buy-me price, I jumped and ordered it up.

The movies themselves are awesome, sound great in 7.1, great HD graphics and fx.  Awesome all around.  Extras are very worthy.

However, the packaging I'm going to give an ""F"" to.  The sleeve is waaay too tight.  It's a wrestling match to get the individual disks out.  Similarly, the inside paper cover of each of the disks is both cheap and ill-fitting.  On one disk, it's cut so bad, you can't see the title on the spine.  Very disappointing.

If you're going to only watch this set once, it's great.  If you plan on getting frustrated every time you take it out, think twice.  Great movies, spoilt by crappy packaging.

All the best,

I hadn't seen some of the older ones though I watched many Star Trek series on TV and have seen all the more recent Star Trek movies. I like Matrix, X-Men, Star Wars, Star Trek, etc., so if you haven't seen these and like those kinds of films, I highly recommend it. Plus, the price was unbeatable.",1377907200,,661,4.426229508196721

The films in this set are on the list that you must see if you consider yourself a film buff. Get past the Trekkie aspect, the space opera delivery, and look at the films in a technical light and consider them as products of their time; you will get an idea on how big an accomplishment each of them were.

To often people are scared away from good films just by the sheer weight that the die-hard fans criticize them with, but it shouldn't be the reason to like or dislike them. Each film has its own little gem moments of camera work, acting, and special effects that make them a joy to view.

If you want to dig deeper into the worlds of these films, there is a plethora of bonus material that will keep you busy and educate you.

The only objection that I have is that there are several promos at the start of each movie. you can always skip over these but as always I object to having to either watch or skip over promos to watch a movie.  It's just my feeling and others may not have this small gripe.  However the price and the packaging were a good value. I give this box set five stars.,1375833600,,563,4.175925925925926

It really tied a lot of things togethert and you get all the double entendres! If for no other reason, see these movies to really apprecialte how far the movie industry has come with special effects.
I wouldn't have gone out of my way to buy this if it wasn't for the fact that it was a gold-box deal (and my wife is a trekkie - go figure). It's a hard sell at the regular price, so wait for a deal.

I began with Star Trek, the Motion Picture, watching each during my 90-minute sessions on an air circulation machine for my legs. I have lymphedema in both so I need twice-daily treatments. What better way to spend them than watching the Enterprise crew in action. I suppose my favorite is the last one in the package as it is always hilarious to watch and listen to McCoy with his binoculars trained on his captain trying to scale El Capitan. When he, Kirk and Spock are on the ground at the campfire, Kirk and Bones introduce Spock to Row, Row, Row Your Boat. Meanwhile, Bones is cooking up his special beans which means he adds Bourbon to it and serves it to Spock who says it is quite good. The bulk of the movie is a lot more serious, but in the end we are back at the same campground and Spock picks out a tune on his Vulcan instrument, and what should he play but Row, Row, Row Your Boat.

I've had this combo since it was first released as a set on VHS [with a free chest piece insignia]. I've picked up various updates and director's cuts over the years. I REALLY wanted to have one box set. When mine arrived, I was shocked at how dark the reproduction was. Earlier versions had correct lighting, not this one. That was very disappointing. Also, even though it says that these were the original movies, it would have been nice to see the directors cuts as they were much more enjoyable. The added bonus was the disc ""The Captain's Summit"". I'm big on things like this and this is what is missing from the internet based programming.

3784343,4,B001S3GDT0,The only thing that I do not like about the films is that they are not in full screen and maybe that is the only way that they can format it. The movies are great and they are very clear.,1371945600,,187,3.7
3784344,5,B001S3GDT0,"Excellent collection contains the best songs of the artist. Product with graphic refined, perfect fitting, short: flawless. Loved. I recommend. Very good.",1371859200,,154,6.045454545454546

3784347,5,B001S3GDT0,"How could you ask for more than all original series movies on Blu-Ray in one box, for less than the individual movies? I don't know, now to acquire all the original series and ST:TNG TV series on Blu-Ray too.",1371772800,,208,4.358974358974359
3784348,5,B001S3GDT0,"This DVD alone is worth the price--it's fantastic--funny --informative-the movies are not the extended version but after I watched Summit it did not matter LOL I have the extended versions on other DVDs anyway--I got this set for the Summit and it was well worth the money
Shatner is hilarious as usual-Nimoy is  funny and informative--Stewart is funnier than you will expect and Frakes is a riot
Whoopi Goldberg does the interviews and is great",1371686400,,445,4.933333333333334
3784349,3,B001S3GDT0,"The picture quality in some of these is attrocious and distracting, these aren't the special editions transfers that were released on the two disc dvds from years past. These are the theatrical, warts and all versions. So beware!",1371686400,,229,5.052631578947368
3784350,4,B001S3GDT0,"I understand the disappointment expressed by many reviewers. This is not a BlueRay quality you may expect based on other more recent releases, But the overall quality played on BlueRay player is OK and for the special price that is far less that for 6 single DVDs (not even BlueRays) it is a good buy.",1371686400,,301,4.490909090909091

I expected that this would not have the Director's Cut of The Wrath Of Kahn, but I did NOT expect a lessser Undiscovered Country which was lack over 1 minute of crucial informative scenes which were all related to Rene Auberjonis's charector who was cut completely out.

That doesn't mean that the odd numbered ones are bad, though... well... the 5th one is rough (thought it seems to have influenced J.J. Abrams' reboots -- at least the love of lens flares.)

1 is overall boring and ponderous, though the characters bring it to life in spots. 2, 3, and 4 create a very cool trilogy that is the heart of this series. 5 has good ideas but is a cheap-looking misfire. 6 is a great return to form and a nice send off for the original cast.

All the movies look great, except for 5, which is oddly blurry and dull considering they were all given the high def treatment for blu-ray. Maybe it's just the way it was shot?

The extras are amazing, the movies are fun, and if you like STAR TREK at all, I highly recommend this set.",1369526400,,925,4.244318181818182

Favorite line: ""where are the nuclear wessels"" and the strange looks from the 20th century citizens in San Francisco.  These movies are really great and watchable multiple times.  I highly recommend purchasing this set.  They have some nice extras too.  Note that Piccard is only in Captain's Summit with Riker--that was rather interesting.

Seriously, if this really is new to you, I'd definitely recommend this set.  I'd start with movie II, The Wrath of Khan - ties in with the original television series, including Montalban planning Khan - so awesome!!  The first movie is great (to this die hard Trekkie), but it moves at a slower pace, so might be better to watch out of order.

As for the quality of the movies.  The picture quality looked amazing and a significant improvement from my DVDs.  The remastering is probably not as thorough as the work on the Bond films which look perfect, but this is probably as good as you will see the first six films.

These discs are packaged individually in thin plastic cases with minimal exterior design. Not much in the way of inserts. The picture and sound are great quality like you'd expect in any movie in DVD format. I've had these in VHS for years, so it was nice to see a much better picture and hear sound without the analog hum. Definitely recommend.",1368057600,,705,4.30827067669173

I played them all in a marathon viewing and it was very enjoyable to me to see them in sequence all together for the first time. They have all held up very well, both stories and effects. I bought them at a huge discount, thanks Amazon!

NB:
 - I am hearing impaired and prefer English subtitles to view. The subtitles are included on all of these movies! And on all of these the subtitles were complete and were accurate! (For those who don't know, CC is *NOT* subtitling and it usually is way, way off, incomplete, gives strange words and sentence structure, etc., so actual subtitling is indispensable to truly understand. CC is a VERY poor substitute and rarely even adequate.)
 - I prefer the later Director's Cut of Star Trek the Motion Picture version. This collection includes the original theatrical release version.
 - I viewed them on a dvd player and am planning on viewing them again through a BluRay to see how they look. I may now be spoiled by HD as they all seemed slightly fuzzy to me. I was distracted by actually being able to see the moving effects ""boxes"", some kind of a visible distortion surrounding the effects in the Motion Picture.

And just so other customers know, I received this order two days ahead of scheduled delivery which is always nice. But it wasn't packaged properly. The shipping box had a crushed corner, no padding inside the shipping box, so the dvd collection box's corner was also crushed.",1367884800,,1489,4.625

The visuals and sound are superb, and the additional disk with cast interviews and commentaries is a nice bonus. Also the price paid through Amazon was a far better value than anywhere else I looked at.
I would've given it a 5 star rating if the movies had included the deleted scenes found on previous editions.  Even then they are enjoyable as they are in their original theatrical versions. Is definitely a must have set to upgrade your DVD version of it, or even better as a new addition to your collection.",1367884800,,613,4.5225225225225225

With all that, I would say these discs look and sound fantastic.  I've watched four of the six movies and they're all uniformly clear, crisp, bright and colorful.  The detail pops off of the screen.

That is all well and good but if you like to nit-pic the movies and make comments about what is wrong or could be better, forget it.  I know a person who does that and I do not watch movies with that person unless I have too.

I enjoy these movies for what they are, great entertainment for Trekies.  I will say the Blu-ray movies are super and it does make all the difference.  Sit back and enjoy, get into the story and don't get ahead of the plot.  Some of the movies are better than others, but they are are all Star Trek.",1367798400,,651,4.209677419354839

I also have the original series on blu-ray. Even so, I probably would not have purchased this boxed set except for the extremely low sale price. It was sort of an impulse purchase.

As you would expect, the picture and sound quality is better than DVD. My system includes 5.1 surround sound, an HD projector and a big screen.

There are a number of documentary-style extras as I expected. They are in sub-directories in the extensive extra feature section of each disk. I haven't had the time to look at all of them yet, but I have watched all the movies. I haven't seen the ""captain's conference"" disk yet.

The extras also have a running Starfleet Database functio, a kind of running glossary of terms and mini-biographies of characters and events, which can be accessed while watching the movie, but it isn't complete. I remember trying to find the source of the quote ""may fortune favor the foolish"" in the index and it wasn't there. I ended up looking this up on the internet after watching the movie.

Watching these with my son has been a great introduction to older production movies, as pretty much every movie he has seen to date uses all of the new flashy CGI style enhancements, so explaining to him that when Khan puts the parasite into the crew members ears, that is what Special Effects were like back then.

However, starting with movie #2 (Wrath of Kahn) the story picks up, the action picks up and the tempo increases with each movie after that.  My favorite was #4 when they came back to earth through time (in a Klingon ship) and landed in Golden Gate park in the 1970's.  Good humor there.",1367798400,,429,4.271604938271605

3784493,5,B001S3GDT0,"Just got started with this set. Decided to start in the middle, and will have to get to all of them soon.
I'm perfectly fine with the fact that these are all supposed to be the theatrical versions. I like some of the little changes on the previous home releases of these movies, but it's kind of nice to see them make these available in their ""original"" form. I'm sure that if they didn't, some would surely complain, and it'd be kind of sad.
Think about it - the real original Star Wars movies (4-6) are only available on a badly transferred, letterboxed-inside-4:3-Standard-def-DVD, as a bonus disc, on out of print DVDs (circa 2006, which, I do own).

These Star Trek movies are high quality, high definition transfers of 6 classic movies, as they were, ""warts and all,"" and I'm fine with that. Maybe someday, they'll put out a set with ""directors cuts"" etc, and sure, I do see the point some have made about ""why couldn't they have just done seamless branching"" - but - this is still really nice to have the best qualtiy copies of these movies, using as much of a disc as they can, even with a few extras on each one.

Nice set. Well done. Not overdone. Nice simple menus, though I don't understand the promo for the 11th movie on these in the beginning. It's a box set. If anything, they should've put that on the bonus disc, as a bonus trailer or something. No reason for it to be on the main discs. Kind of cheesy. Kind of lame. It's not like most fans haven't heard of this, or wouldn't go see it. Then again, I suppose it doesn't really hurt anything. I do have an individual blu-ray of IV, so I'll have to see if it's also on that too. At least it's not taking up too much space.

Transfer seems nice on III so far. I'm sure the others also look great. Pretty cool to have a good box set of all of these on blu-ray.

Checked one extra on III before starting the movie, and it was really cool to see and hear the stories from some of the folks who worked on these movies. Digital effects are neat at times, sure, but these guys really made some great things happen with the tech they had to work with.
Real models and effects are still great. No matter how great computer graphics get, and no matter how cool some of it really is, the capture of something really tactile and really reacting is ...well... more real... These folks also have another great point - they had a lot of fun doing a lot of this work, and I can really respect the work they did to bring us their efforts.

All in all, this is a good set. If you already have a DVD set, it might not interest you that much. If you don't care about the theatrical versions, it might not matter to you. To me, it just seemed like a fair deal to finally get this collection, and as a long time fan, I am not in the least bit disappointed. I am quite happy to have this set, and to be able to enjoy these classic films once again.",1365638400,,2892,4.212996389891697

My only issue is with my Blu-ray DVD player Samsung HT-C6930W/XAA that is not playing most of these movies, maybe an update is needed in order to play them.

I'm not in it for the content so much (who hasn't seen these films a hundred times each at this point - well I mean II through V) The Captains Summit disc is really nice, I enjoyed that discussion very much. So far, a nice boxed set of the original series films.

I apparently got a bad disc III though. Star Trek III - The Search for Spock doesn't work in my (brand new) Sony Blu-ray player. I'm hoping for an easier solution than returning the whole set for a new one, The disc doesn't appear damaged so I don't know what the problem would be.

Gave 4 starts for meets expectations, with the exception of the bad third disc. Amazon what's the easiest method for getting customer support on a single disc problem like this?",1365292800,,813,4.30718954248366

Admittedly, the first and fifth movies I thought were rather dumb and dull, it just wouldn't be a proper collection without them.  The bonus DVD, 'Captain's Summit' is an interesting addition as it's more of a discussion with the many of the characters from both the original series as well as the Next Generation where they share their thoughts and opinions on not only the movies, but each series and the parts they played in them.

3784503,5,B001S3GDT0,"For fans of the original Star Trek series and the characters that were part of it, this Blu-Ray collection of six movies plus a bonus disk offers unmatched Trekkie immersion.  On the bonus disk, Whoopie Goldberg, who successfully invited herself into the TV series and played the role of the mysterious Guynan, the counselor/bartender in the starship's Ten Forward lounge, spends more than an hour chatting with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Johnathan Frakes and Patrick Stewart.  This bonus disk is a rare opportunity to see the stars all together and out-of-character, speaking candidly about their real-life adventures that resulted from being in the Star Trek series and in the movies.  I found the conversations fascinating.

Often single-title Blu-Ray packages have both a Blu-Ray and standard DVD plus the ability to digitally download the movie onto a portable device.  This collection includes ONLY Blu-Ray disks and no downloads.  Briefly Amazon offered this collection for just $34.99, which worked out to be less than $5 per disk, so I quickly bought this collection for my movie library.

Aside from the compact but attractive packaging, I found the digital reproduction of these movies on a 1080p screen quite satisfying, giving me all of the detail that I could ever want.  Although I don't have a surround sound system, my movie audio does go through a high-quality receiver that feeds two excellent full-range speaker systems.  I found the sound quality as satisfying as the video reproduction.  In summary, if you're a fan of the Star Trek original cast and their six movies and wish to enjoy them with crystal clear video and sound reproduction I don't believe that it will get any better than this for the money.",1365206400,15,1734,5.073943661971831

3784522,3,B001S3GDT0,"I bought this DVD set to replace my old set of VHS tapes of the same movie series. While the picture quality was good, I was very disappointed in the sound quality of the first (oldest movie).. there were 2 or 3 scenes where the background noise of the ship was louder than the dialogue. (not that way on my VHS tapes so I know the movie wasn't intended to be that way). I could deal with that if it was only that one disk. The other 5 movies didn't have that same problem but they DID have spurts of volume blackout.. the sound would go out for one or two words of a sentence at least 2 or 3 times during each disk. Irritating but I can live with that for the price I paid. What set me off enough to write this review was that the last movie, ""Undiscovered Country"" was missing at least 2 scenes (or parts of scenes). The scenes involving the actor Ren Auberjonois were completely cut out!! I tried to Google why this was done but couldn't really find anything that would justify why one of my favorite movies in the series was cut up! I looked back at my VHS and it was not a ""special editorial cut"" or anything either. I had read a couple of reviews before buying this DVD set and saw none that mentioned this outrageous cut job! (There might be some but I missed them) So now i have a DVD  in which my VHS tape is a better viewing of the movie than the DVD copy... that is maddening to me! I'm trying to think if i would still have bought this set if i had known the scenes were cut out...  I don't know... I guess if you don't know about the scenes they don't take away from the movie... but I do so it's bothering me.",1362960000,4,1623,4.052959501557632

I am NOT one of those who goes to conventions and pretends to be ""Marktar from the fifth quadrant of Machupichu heir to Moloran"", but I LOVE Trek over Wars any day of the week.

Yes, he is that hardcore.  If your a fan you must have this collection. I think the Fifth movie was kind of boring but the rest are amazing. I do have to admit that I think the best part of ANY of the movies is in Trek 4 The Voyage Home.

This saga starts a decade after cancellation, but within the fictional time line it's just two and a half years after Kirk's five year mission! Unlike most fans, I like the motion picture! This AI called V'ger heads to earth to find its Creator! This set doesn't have the director's cut! Odd how they updated every episode including the unaired pilot, but they didn't decide to release the director's cut to match everything up! Hopefully the release of the newest film will inspire a release of the director's cut to honor Robert Wise's memory! Other blu rays suffer from this lack of director's cut: Army of Darkness, Lethal Weapon, The Punisher & Live Free or Die Hard!

Wrath of Khan is a sequel to the episode Space Seed from season one! Like The Motion Picture, it's just the theatrical release!

The Search For Spock & The Voyage Home are continuations to Wrath of Khan!

The Final Frontier is my least favorite of this set, yet my least favorite Trek story of all is at the end of season two of next generation! Lots of clips!

The Undiscovered Country is a great ending to this set and leaves it open for Encounter at Farpoint, which opens the first season of Next Generation! Unfortunately, there's no director's cut here either!

Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. They included the theatrical cut. This cut edits out four minutes of scenes. The bulk of that deals with Peter Preston. Don't remember him? He's that cadet that Kirk picks on at the start of the film and the one Scotty brings to the bridge after the first battle with Khan. These scenes explain who he is and why Kirk and Scotty paid so much attention to him. (Still doesn't explain why he took a dying man to the bridge and not sickbay, but maybe he though Kirk was awesome enough to heal the kid through the power of charisma?) I'd suggest finding the Director's Edition of WoK as a supplement to this set, so you get the whole movie. The Director's Edition is also called the TV Cut and is director Nick Myer's preferred version of the movie.

The Motion Picture is also the Theatrical Cut, but other cuts only serve to put ALL the effects shots from the pre-release cut back in, so I don't see the point in complaining about less padding.",1358726400,2,1239,4.406113537117904

3784622,5,B001S3GDT0,Welcome to the world of the original and still best version of the Star Trek universe. I'm glad these movies weren't treated like the original Star Wars trilogy and re-done with CGI images.

The video quality is great on all of the movies, and you get the commentaries from the dvds plus some new ones.  You also get a disc with new material and interviews.  Missing:  The text commentary tracks from the Okudas.  Those were a big part of why I loved the dvds.  The Motion Picture is the theatrical version, not the directors cut.  That means that there are no updated visuals like there are in that version, and a few scenes are cut/different.  So, if you buy this, don't throw away that dvd.  The menus on these discs suck, they are not as clever or beautiful as the ones on the dvd collection from a few years ago.  Every disc has trailers that are near impossible to skip.  You'll get so tired of the trailer for the new JJ Abrams Star Trek movie.  The Wrath of Khan is curiously the directors version that came to dvd, so you get the annoying Preston scene.  Save your old Wrath of Khan dvd (the first one, not the directors edition) if you want the best quality of the theatrical version.",1353974400,,1090,4.336633663366337

Except for 1, the missing scenes are not included even as bonus features. The ""Operation Retrieve"" that was (in)famously removed from the theatrical cut is missing, as is the ""this is not Klingon blood"" and the unmasking of Colonel West scene. In 2, the scenes that reference Peter Preston being Scotty's nephew are gone. The least they could have done was include the scenes as deleted scene bonus features. They advertise having the ""original, theatrical versions"" as if it's a good thing, but it feels like something's missing.

3784665,4,B001S3GDT0,"I will keep this short.

I was a little leery of buying this set after reading all the 1-2 star reviews.  The price was right though so I took a chance.

It turns out that the quality is excellent.  Yes, these are the theatrical versions. If you are looking for some of the extra stuff not in the theatrical release (as many Star Trek Fans may be) then don't buy this set.  Spend more money.  For me though, the cuts that they made for the theatrical release do not stop me from enjoying these movies as I also enjoyed them in the theater.

Why only 4 stars?  It's not quality related since the quality is good.  The 4 stars is only recognizing that some people may be looking for the directors cut.  If I was just rating this for myself I would give it 5 stars.",1344902400,,762,4.157534246575342
3784666,5,B001S3GDT0,"This is a very nice set for both Star Trek fans and Sci Fi fans alike. It is loaded with lots of epic space battles with excellent villains and nefarious aliens; and the picture and sound quality are excellent. Each disk has a fair amount of extras as well including trailers and commentaries and interviews and deleted scenes. The bonus disk The Captain's Summit interviews with William Shatner, Patrick Stewart, Leonard Nimoy, Jonathan Frakes and Whoopi Goldberg was very entertaining as well

Star Trek: The Motion Picture - A powerful gigantic and unknown destructive force named V'Ger is heading it's way towards the Earth and it is up to Captain James T. Kirk and the Enterprise crew to try and stop it. Amazing special effects. The return of the original veteran TV series cast reunites together on the big screen. A fabulous Jerry Goldsmith musical score. A 10 out of 10.

Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan - Ricardo Montalban returns to reprise his role as Khan, a mad genetic super soldier who seeks revenge on Captain Kirk for stranding he and his crew on a desolate planet. An exciting action-packed space adventure with great special effects, and it features one of the most quoted movie lines ever, ""KHAN!"" A 10 out of 10 rating.

Star Trek III: the Search For Spock - Where did Spock go, and who needs to find him, and why? Well, if you haven't seen Star Trek II then I do not want to spoil it for you, but this movie's got space battles with big bad Klingons and more than enough Star Trekking adventure to make for a pretty fun and entertaining threequel. I rate it a solid 9 out of 10.

Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home - Honestly, this is not one of my more favorite movies in the series. Kirk and the crew travel back in time to the 1980's in order to save the whales. That's pretty much it. It has some good fish-out-of-water laughs here and there but it needed more space action scenes for my tastes. I've gotta give it credit for trying to do something different though. A 7 out of 10.

Star Trek V: The Final Frontier - A lot of people seem to not like this entry in the series but I think it's a pretty fun movie and enjoyed it a lot. A Vulcan hijacks the Enterprise to go on a search for the Supreme Being! That's right. Lots of exciting action sequences and pretty nice special effects and great sets make for a good Sci Fi time at the movies. An 8.5 out of 10.

Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country - In a mission to escort a Klingon Chancellor to a Peace Summit meeting between the Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire, sabotage and deception are the order of the day as an attempt by nefarious interests to disrupt the historic event goes into action. This was the final film of the series featuring the original cast members and what a way to go. Features an engaging storyline, fantastic special effects, action sequences aplenty, this movie has it all for both Sci Fi and Star Trek fans alike. A 9.5 out of 10 rating.

All in all this is a great collection for a great price. Scotty, beam this set up.",1344470400,2,3038,4.404634581105169
3784667,4,B001S3GDT0,"Picture and sound quality are good, as to be expected from BD, BUT...

Before you buy this, be aware that these are the THEATRICAL versions of the movies, and NOT the director's cuts.  I was disappointed when I popped in Wrath of Kahn and realized that the scene with Scotty's nephew was missing.  (I was even more upset because I had traded in my director's cut DVD's to replace them with these BD's.)",1344124800,2,402,4.47945205479452
3784668,4,B001S3GDT0,"I not only like to have these extra documentaries for reference, but I'm also a bit OCD and when I upgrade I hate to lose anything from previous formats.  I bought this on sale at Amazon and felt it was worthwhile to go from DVD to BD because of the sale price.

I previously had the box set of Original Trek movies containing these six films in the two-disc versions (Collector's or Director's Editions).  I was very interested to see if the BluRay set had everything from the DVD set.

First, some good news.  Each of the BD versions has at least one (often more) Bonus Features, in HiDef, which were not on the DVD versions.

Next, bad news.  Film I had three BFs on the DVD version which were not included on the BD version.  Also the DVD version was the Extended Cut and the BD was not, nor were there Deleted Scenes on the BD version.  Similar issue for film II -- Director's Cut on DVD but not on BD and no Deleted Scenes (though the BD did have all the BFs from the DVD).

More good news.  Films III through VI were not missing any BFs from the DVDs and they all (IIRC) had Deleted Scenes (though I don't remember the DVD versions being Extended or Director's Cuts anyway).

More bad news.  All of the DVD versions had a Text Commentary track from the Okudas.  This is a version of the film with popup boxes from time to time with tidbits of info.  I like these text commentaries over audio commentaries because you can watch and listen to the film while still getting extra info.  With audio commentaries, you mostly can't hear the film dialog so you either listen to the film with no commentary or you listen to commentary.  All of the DVD versions had this text commentary but none of the BD versions did (that I could find).

So, to sum up -- the BD set has more Bonus Features than the DVD set, but is missing a few BFs and some scenes that were available on the DVD set.  The BD set is also missing the text commentaries from the Okudas.

And so my end rating is four stars.  The film quality itself is good enough to allow for five stars, so any adjustments I make are based on features.  Although I get some extras here not on DVD, I'm missing others, and my OCD won't let me give five stars for not completely superseding the previous format.",1344038400,2,2259,4.278301886792453

3784686,5,B001S3GDT0,"ok completely honest review here.

I only watched one movie from this set so far, that was #6 The Undiscovered Country, which is my favorite of entire series.  Since #6 is the last I expected the quality to be pretty good when transferred to Blu-Ray.  Wow!  I was blown away at how good the picture looked in Blu-Ray.  Actually it looked so good, you could see too much of the actor's make up at times.  My expectations are not high for #1 or #2 but I will update my review.  Still, I am very happy with the purchase.  If you are a regular guy who liked these movies, I think you'll be happy with the set.

Update July 2, 2012:  Star Trek The Movie (#1) was not of Blu Ray quality but I did enjoy it.  The Wrath of Khan (#2) was much better.  I don't think #2 was 1080p but it seemed like it was upscaled by the DVD player.  I was impressed for a 1982 movie.  Again, very happy with the purchase overall.",1339632000,,904,4.091428571428572

I did everything I could to fix it like wiping the disc with a soft cloth and blowing it but nothing helps. I would've given it a five star, but the disc is the issue and I wanna return this product back. So far I only saw Star Trek 1 & 2, but the third didn't do so well.

3784689,4,B001S3GDT0,"The Star Trek 6 pack contains the first six movies, all with (more or less) Kirk, Spock, Scotty and Bones and the crew. The videos are in FABULOUS BluRay high definition/high density HD with Dolby TrueHD lossless 5.1 surround. My machine shows several of these movies process at 6 mb/S Dolby 7.1.

My ONLY regret is that back in the late 70s and early 80s the only folks with big high powered subwoofers were a few thousand very wealthy people in Southern California and New York. The audio tracks, although they are pristine clean, are just a little weak, decibel wise, so you have to crank your system up even if you are running 1500 watts. Also the LFE subwoofer tracks are not full and lively like they are with most of the last ten or fifteen years' movies.

The transfers are well done and Star Trek The Motion Picture is actually darn close to the Director's Cut, as opposed to that terrible hatchet job Robert Wise did when the studio gave him the final cut mere weeks before the premeir of the Movie in Hollywood. The Directors Cut was a fine version, plush with great scenes and panoramic perspectives that were just absent in the original release.

Star Treks II, III and VI are outstanding in most every respect.
Audio, Video, effects, transfer, presentation.
I would give this pack 5 stars, but the shortage of perky audio forces me to give 4 stars for this excellent collection of greats. Every true Trek fan should have this in his/her collection.",1338595200,5,1462,4.615384615384615

3784698,4,B001S3GDT0,"Star Trek is one of those film series that simply must be seen on a format like Blu-ray.  I hesitated on this set, however, after reading all the harsh comments about the picture quality.  I finally purchased it, and I can definitely say that all that criticism was very unwarranted.  These films - all of them - look absolutely outstanding.  Yes, I am aware that all the films except The Wrath of Khan were merely remastered in 1080p and not restored from the original print.  However, that doesn't stop you from being able to see minute details on everything from uniforms and skin tone.  Compared to the DVD set (which itself was pretty impressive), the Blu-rays look significantly better.  The Wrath of Khan, being the only one that was completely restored in 1080p, looks phenomenal.

Another added bonus and improvement over the DVD's is that ALL of the films are now presented in their original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The DVD's were shown in 2.35:1 except for Star Trek IV and Star Trek VI, which were cropped to 2:1.  Seeing Star Trek VI in its full widescreen glory was simply incredible, as Paramount has released horrible cropped widescreen versions of this particular film in the past (remember the original widescreen VHS and DVD where the image was shown in the top of the screen so they could fit the subtitles on the bottom?).  As far as the sound is concerned, we get pristine audio as expected.

Extras are decent, with each film getting several hours of exclusive and previously released content.  A bonus seventh disc, ""The Captain's Summit"" is an interesting 70-minute chat between William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Steward, Jonathan Frakes and Whoopi Goldberg.  I found it to be a pretty welcome addition.

The only negative of this collection is the omission of Director's Cuts on Star Trek: The Motion Picture, The Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country.  As I'm sure most videophiles know, the superb Director's Cut for The Motion Picture couldn't be done without completely re-doing the new special effects, so while it's a bummer that couldn't be done in time for this release, it's somewhat understandable.  However, why they didn't include the longer versions of the other two films is rather puzzling.

In the end, however, this is a set well-worth your time.  Seeing these films in such detail was a joy, and it's pretty great how well the films hold up.  4 Stars.",1332979200,8,2404,4.845588235294118

What really bothered me is they force you to watch that ... jj abrams movie trailer on every single damn disc. What of the fans who do not care to see that and hated the new movie?

Also that movie is so far gone where no man has gone before it should not even be linked to the original star trek series or movies I-VI.

Anyway point is, I was very very dissapointed with the rush job they did on the sound effects and visuals.
Its very buffled, some parts are hard to hear and visually the whole movies look like they were in the dark during most scenes.

I actually prefer the dvd releases.

Just to add to that, the dvd releases had many edits as well from the vhs versions..mainly screen aspect ratios and little touch ups and removing clips. Thats right they removed a lot of clips . Little things you notice having watched the vhs version for so many years before dvd came out and you decided to invest in it.

I'm not some small town hillbilly but I think its not fair to force changes on people. So anyway to conclude here, I bought this box set and did not get past the third movie... the visuals like I said and sound very very off for some reason and also not even that great for blue ray quality.  and yes the jj abrams trailer on every disc really really bothered me.
Glad I kept my dvd's and actually regret donating my vhs so I could compare the screen shots. but dvd is fine I guess.

3784747,3,B001S3GDT0,"(Actually 3.5 stars)

I'm not the type to get bothered by the intricacies of ""absolutely perfect to the last pixel and decibel and must be from the hand of God only"" debates and demands. As long as there are no obvious artifacts, and it looks and sounds nice n' clear, it's good enough for me. If it looks, however slightly, better than the DVD, then it's a welcome bonus. This set has all of those issues taken care of, so there it is -- good picture and sound.

The Next Gen Movie set is more straightforward than this set; in that case, all of the SE DVD extras are transferred, and the movies are simply as is, no ""special editions."" Here, with the original six movies, that doesn't always apply:

1) The first movie is now just the regular extended edition, rather than the still-fascinating Director's Edition from the 2001 SE DVD. Also, none of the major extras from that DVD are on this Blu-Ray. Therefore, assuming you like any version of this first movie, you should keep or buy the DVD version, too.

2) Wrath of Khan's SE DVD was another ""Director's Edition"" and it seems like the Blu-Ray is missing a few of the SE DVD's extras.

3) Undiscovered Country has been reverted back to the regular edition, although the extra minute on the SE DVD is nothing much besides Scooby-Doo-level trype.

There are two commentaries per movie, one old, one new. The new commentaries range from redundant (Nicholas Meyer returns to say mostly the same things as before) to annoying (some time is wasted of Trek 3's new cmtry. rattling on about the new ""Battlestar Galactica"") to generally fine and sometimes fun or informative.

The Captain's summit is okay, as Whoopi Goldberg attempts to interview the actors who played the commanding officers of the two most famous starships Enterprise. A lot of it descends into quirkiness and jokes, but it's all in good fun.

Of the new extras, only three of them really entertained me at all: Trek 6 has a few scenes of the Klingon ""Hamlet"" to watch. Trek 2 has an okay look at Trek movie relics and a discussion with movie 2 and 3 composer James Horner. The ILM documentary is fine, too.

Trek movie rankings, worst to best: V(FF);  IX, X (I,N);  I (TMP);  VI (UC); [XI ('09)]?; VII (Gs); VIII (1C);  II to IV (WK, S4S, VH)

It's a strange irony that the two worst TOS movies -- I and V-- have two of Jerry Goldsmith's best Trek scores. With the last two TNG movies, I and V form what I call the ""really bad existentialist quadrilogy,"" with V (Final Frontier) the worst and The (1st) Motion Picture the best of those four.

The sixth movie is, for me, the start of what I call the ""Passing the Torch"" trilogy, which is filled out by the first (""better"") two TNG movies. Trek 6 is just as informed by the presence of ""The Next Generation"" as it is by contemporary events. Good story, good (and very different for Trek) music score.

Wrath of Khan, Search for Spock, and Voyage Home (2,3,4), the three best Trek movies ever, form a loose ""Genesis/Spock trilogy,"" with the otherwise fairly separate fourth movie bookended by the conclusion of events from the previous films (and a dab of setup for Trek 6, as it turns out), with Spock's search for himself during the movie. Amazing stories, nice visuals, great Horner scores for 2 & 3. Trek 4's score is uninspired, pedestrian, insipid; and some of the movie's humor ages better than the rest.

Most of those reviewers who gave it one star are technically correct when they say that Paramount could have done a better job.  The ""restoration"" of The Wrath of Khan is easily the best looking of the films, and watching it can make you wish that all the films had been restored in the same manner.
That being said, these movies look better than they ever have.  Watch the Klingon ships approach V'Ger in The Motion Picture: Director's Edition DVD on an upconverting player, then replace it with this BluRay version, and I think you will discover that all of the complaints are overblown.

3784805,4,B001S3GDT0,"The Star Trek films have never looked or sounded better than this BluRay release. Paramount/CBS should be proud of what they've done.

Star Trek The Motion Picture, while not being the superior 2000 Robert Wise-supervised director's cut, is still an amazing experience on BluRay. If one divorces oneself from the Star Wars hysteria of the late 70s and watches this movie as its own experience, it actually holds up rather well in its original theatrical version. While there are occasional flaws that would eventually need cleaning up in restoration, the HD picture just sparkles with life I certainly don't remember from the theater. There is detail and color, especially in the visual effects, that render this a hypnotically beautiful film.

STII's restoration is a true eye-opener that demands repeated viewings to appreciate all the colors and textures that never had the opportunity to catch our eyes in previous remasters. The story, of course, is classic, and has never looked or sounded better.

STIII, was a surprise, especially since I had read some reviews saying the picture was squashed with too much DNR. It was bright, colorful and filled with fine detail, and Harve Bennett's script was better than I remember it when I first saw it.

STIV was just as good as STIII's HD master, and of course the story is one of ST's most enjoyable.

STV did not age well at all. The HD remaster revealed the low quality of Bran Ferren's poor visual effects in a way I had never expected, bringing the whole visual experience down two notches. The sound, while powerful, had too much dynamic range, forcing me to do multiple volume adjustments during playback in order to balance dialog with louder action-oriented passages. Even Lord of the Rings, with its ubiquitous battle sequences, had a soundtrack I never had to adjust once in my home viewings. And of course, no amount of remastering can save this horrid script, but I did sit through it all again from start to finish.

STVI was probably one of the best looking and sounding movies of this set. I was very satisfied that they elected to go with the original theatrical version of this film instead of the multiple home video versions released in the past. For one thing, the 2.35:1 framing (over the 1.85:1 of the previous DVD) gave it back the grandeur that it originally had when I saw it on opening night back in December 1991. And the plot was better served by the tighter editing--the extra scenes included on past home video releases were entertaining, but totally unnecessary.

The extra ""Captains' Summit"" was an entertaining conversation. It is worth one view, but probably no more.

This is a fabulous set, which I recommend to both Star Trek fans and general HD movie buffs. I do have to give Paramount extra credit for honoring the history and legacy of these films in their original forms, as we all saw them in our local theaters way back when, unlike a certain media mogul who's initials are G.E.O.R.G.E. L.U.C.A.S.

I've owned multiple versions of these films and the picture quality of these DVDs is far superior. That's obviously most important. However, I was dissapointed these discs didn't include the extended editions of the films. In some stories, like The Wrath of Kahn, you miss an important piece of the back story. I also thought the DVD collection was weak on bonus features. Obviously there is the Bonus Captain's Summit, but as for the actual movies, nothing we haven't seen before, and not much there.

Overall classic stories and great picture quality. If having the extras or extended cuts is a big deal, you may need to look at other editions. If picture is key,you can't beat this set.",1308441600,,803,4.695035460992908

True, I enjoy seeing movies shown as they were shown the first time in the theater, but if a later version of the film is made, and it is better and sometimes longer, it seems that it should be offered with the most modern technology.

3784826,5,B001S3GDT0,"Even though their quality is uneven, the five Star Trek films should be viewed in sequence for a full appreciation of the series.  Star Trek:  The Motion Picture more or less stands on its own.  Rushed by Paramount, Robert Wise delivered a package far less than he knew he was capable of.  This version is the one he would have produced if allowed.  Much better.  The Wrath of Khan gets us fully back on track, as Kirk and friends battle a old nemesis.  The Search for Spock answers the question:  What do you do next when a favorite character was killed off?  The Voyage Home is our favorite, seemingly an environmental commentary (and a pretty good one) that can't disguise a whackingly good story peopled with wonderful characters. Catherine Hicks was/is one of the most underutilized actresses of our times, and her scenes with William Shatner show she can hold her own with the best of them.  The Final Frontier veers off track badly, lurching into metaphysical realms and scattering the pieces into incomprehensibility.  Long before Kirk, Spock, and Sybok meet ""God,"" we've stopped caring.  The Undiscovered Country mostly gets it back, with Christopher Plummer playing a Klingon easily the equal of Christopher Lloyd's Kruge in Search for Spock.  It's a great bridge into the second TV series, in which Klingons serve alongside their former Federation enemies.  The movies are great to watch, and the hardware is good to look at, too, with a handsome presentation case and solid jewel cases.

The remastering of the movies are breathtaking and you never know what you will see.

I bought this collection of big screen Star Trek movies and am glad that I did!  Granted they are standard DVDs and not Blu-Ray, but the movies are there in their entirety and I loved seeing them back-to-back (particularly Star Trek II, III, and IV as they are all tied together and are considered to be a trilogy of sorts).  The central characters in these movies are timeless and iconic in nature, and these movies (along with the 2009 movie by J.J. Abrams) will always be the ones that I remember the most.  The four movies that featured Star Trek: TNG characters were not as well done (the major exception being ""First Contact"", which featured the Borg, the first visit to Earth by Vulcans, and Zefram Cochrane) and are mostly forgettable in nature as they did not feature stories that were as well-tied to that series that these movies are to the original Star Trek series.  I might appear to be biased (and I am), but the cast of the original Star Trek is the one I have grown up with since I was five years old and the series itself was originally aired during the time that we were just beginning to send men into space and to the moon and it made the series that much more interesting to me at that time.  Needless to say, when the first Star Trek movie first premiered in theaters in December of 1979, it was a greatly anticipated event that came to pass after ten years of rumors and speculation concerning a big screen treatment and resurrection of a series that had been cancelled prematurely by NBC, but never truly died in the hearts of its fans.  Again, if you are a true fan of the original Star Trek series, and you loved even just one or two of the movies that were made between 1979 and 1991, you should consider purchasing this collection.

3784858,4,B001S3GDT0,"Okay so i am not going to waste time with extensive reviews of the audio or video quality. i'll just sum up. watching the blu-rays on a high-def set revealed more detail on the films then i noticed before. example : in the voyage home near the beginning when the hijacked bird of prey is still landed on vulcan i can see detailed lines on the ship and clearly make out the people walking around and prepping the ship for take off. visually stunning at a time when big budget CGI shots didn't make or break the movie. it was all about the story and the characters telling it. my positives for the box set are these

-- nice to have the original theatrical cuts of the films. especially The Motion Picture. while the 2 disc directors edition did add a few nice looking CGI shots that i think helped the film i absolutely HATED the remixed audio effects. i am a purist and thought the effects they used in the original cut worked fine and are thankfully used in this version, in all their blairingly loud and drone-voiced splendor.

-- menu design was nice for the discs. easy to find whatever i needed. easy to navigate.

Now the downside...

--- okay so by now we know with the first movie there are 3 different versions of the film. the original theatircal cut, the extended VHS cut and the directors cut. why not do something like they did with i think it was close encounters of the third kind or terminator 2 : judgement day? where they released all 3 versions. (yes there is actually 3 different versions of T2, available on certain versions of the dvd as an easter egg) as other reviewers stated the only movie to get ""the treatment"" (and deservedly so) was the wrath of kahn (which i will get to in a minute) so with a 50GB disc there was plenty of room to fit at least 2 versions of the film. it was explained somewhere on some special feature that the new effects shots created for the directors cut dvd were shot in 480P resolution and they couldn't find a way to transfer them properly to blu-ray. but cummon guys... find a way. i mean sure the cut scenes from the extended VHS were added as special features but i want them back into the movie. kinda feeling gyped on that.

-- same thing with the wrath of kahn. there are 2 versions of the movie. i read someone's review that said the extra few minutes ""dragged it along"". i think that person needs to lay off the romulan ale because those extra few mins explain alot that the theatrical cut kinda left out. why was scotty so visibly upset over the young engineering officer dying? the directors cut tells us that he was his nephew. okay so the other stuff wasn't as informative as that lil tidbt but once you see the full version of the film it is hard to view it any other way, much in the same way most people disreguard the theatrical cut of Aliens in favor of the extended directors cut. it's full, it's complete and it's not included in this set. i dunno what their reasoning is for excluding the directors cut from the boxed set, other then the fact that they are probably gonna roll out another version of the set to try to rake in yet MORE money. and they know full well we will buy it. and YOU know it too.

-- you know i was really young when i saw it but i recall seeing star trek 6 in the theaters and i gotta tell you... near the end when Valeris is revealing her cohorts to capt. kirk by way of vulcan mindmeld i do not recall them flashing back to little pictures of the people she is naming. and again... the whole extended cut thing is missing.

so all in all it's a good set. just wish the studio gave us the right to choose.... then again when you think about it they kinda did. they gave us the right to choose weather or not to buy the next version of the boxed set (when they finally release it. it's comming. you know it is. just wait)

Is that they could have spent a lil extra time to do a set up like they did with the blu ray version of Star Trek (TOS) and had the option to play the theatrical and the extended versions instead of just giving us the theatrical versions. I can't help but think that they are gonna re-release that way some time down the line anyway if the paramount's history with Star Trek is any indicator...

Mini-Movie criticisms. ST 1: Once you're over the initial ""wow, together again"" excitement, it suffered from a desire to whip Star Wars at it's own game (and failed mainly from bad pacing), and borrowed too much from the Original Series theme ""machine in search for its Creator"". ST 2: Best of the bunch, but why couldn't they beam the Genesis device into the Transporter and hold it's pattern?  ST 3: Very UNDERRATED! Kirk deals with so much loss here. FINALLY, it took 3 movies, but we see Kirk fighting in hand-to-hand combat! McCoy's ""link"" to Spock, was a brilliant and poignant touch. Plus Sarek! A focused tribute to the characters, rather than another alien encounter. ST 4. Save the whales? Yes, with a humorous knock on the 20th century. At least this time they filmed in the real outdoors (San Francisco). Then again, the basic premise of an alien probe, associated with Earth's past, and threatening the Earth, rescued by the Enterprise crew, was done in the first movie. ST 5. The weakest, and full of hokum, but not a total wash out. Best scene was the ""share your pain"" of Spock and McCoy. At least this film *attempted* at Star Trek's original theme ""to boldly go where no man/one has gone before"". ST 6: A decent final film. Cold War Ending parable, complete with Chernobyl. Plus two great actors: Christopher Plummer and David Warner! No seeking out new life, but politics centered on a Federation conference. It's also a back story to a Next Generation storyline when the film was initially released.",1282435200,3,1714,4.88659793814433
3784903,1,B001S3GDT0,"I bought this Blue Ray set in great anticipation of the higher definition. The Blue Ray concept is a nice improvement over standard DVD. However, Blue Ray is implemented differently than standard DVD in many ways and differently on each Blue Ray disc. For example, DVD function is left more to the Java Software on the disc rather than the player itself. This allows the manufacturer to maintain greater control over player function.

Now for the problem here. The discs in this set do not implement certain standard disc/player functions like stop and remember position. In other words, if you stop any of these discs and restart, you will be returned to the beginning of the disc, which entails going through the FBI warnings and previews again. You will then need to use the scene function to find your previous position to continue watching the movie where you left off.

If you pause the disc, it will continue where you left off unless the player auto shuts off in 30 minutes and then it is considered a stop function, which requires complete restart of the discs again.

This is not true of all Blue Rays. The Terminator Sarah Conner Chronicles, for example, works correctly, but not this Star Trek Set. It can be very annoying and detract from the movie experience. Personally, I plan to resell this set and return to my standard DVD collection. The difference in resolution just isn't worth the frustration caused by bad software design. Incidentally, Blue ray uses Java; the now defunct HD used a Microsoft software system.",1282003200,22,1533,4.821292775665399
3784904,4,B001S3GDT0,"I love the all of the star trek movies and am generally a huge fan of the entire saga.  However, one thing that I am really disappointed in is that when star trek the motion picture(the first of the original cast films) was on VHS, it was the special longer version aka the extended cut.  I have never heard of the extended cut or longer version of this film being available on dvd or blu ray yet.  In the double disc directors edition of the movie: all of the extra footage that was in the extended cut has been removed from the film and is found in the deleted scenes.  The same thing was done with another movie I loved called ""the lawnmowerman"" - extended cut on VHS and theatrical cut only on dvd.  Has anybody else noticed this and finds it annoying?  In my opinion, it is a sad state of affairs to release a lesser version of any film on dvd or blu ray when there has already been a superior  version of the movie on VHS.  So I am giving this set 4 out of 5 stars because of how awesome star trek truly is.  Live long and Prosper.",1281225600,4,1037,4.094059405940594

In order to make sense of the newest movie your children need to see where it all started. Then they will understand why you rave about the newest actors and just how close they are to their portrayal of the tv series stars. The packaged set is the way to go by far.

Second I have to give Amazon 5 stars for their much improved customer service. I bought the blueray set by mistake. In a matter of seconds I had shipping labels for the return. The credit was issued immediately. The blueray set was returned and I reordered the correct format. The set was at my home in just a few days and I was back to searching the galaxy in no time.

I have been an amazon customer for quite awhile. In the beginning it was not so easy to return, get credit back, heck even to reach a real person for help. I am happy to say this company has my loyalty once again. They have seen the future in gaining good customer service by simply answering the call and doing what they can to insure the customer is satisfied.

I'm off to that star out there to the right...

The seventh disk is all bonus material.

When I read the reviews of this collection I started becoming all confused and turned around by all the Blu Ray talk. Despite what people have said in their reviews, these are standard dvd format, not Blu Ray. Why folks felt compelled to post Blu Ray reviews here, rather than on the ST Blu Ray product I don't understand. You do not need a Blu Ray player to watch these discs. I wanted to make that clear because it's easy to get confused the more reviews here you read. Lot of folks downrated this product seemingly because they couldn't be bothered to read the product description carefully before hitting the buy button.

3784932,3,B001S3GDT0,"I already have all of these on DVD.  But, for myself, I was really looking forward to seeing Star Trek-The Motion Picture: The Director's Cut (STTMP-DC) in Blu-Ray.  So, the set, from that standpoint, is a serious disappointment.  Although, there are a few scenes that in Blu-Ray appear clearer and cleaner than I remember in the theater, this version compared to the STTMP-DC version still disappoints.  Frankly, if I had known at the time that all of these were the theatrical versions, I probably would not have bought the set; regardless the price.  Yes, the picture quality is better overall.  But, frankly, my DVDs looked pretty great on my TV anyway.

When the original STTMP was released in the theaters, I was 22 and must have seen it more than 20 times; even when it was re-released in a double bill with Close Encounters...(those were the days).  I've seen it so many times, I feel I should own stock in it.

The purist are always going to prefer the theatrical version; even though the trip through V'ger's energy field did slow things down quite a bit.  But, that's OK.  Apparently though, I am not a purist.  I find the additional material inserted into this, and the other movies, were virtual revelations and only added to my understanding, enjoyment, and ultimately made the stories more coherent.  In this set, all of that is gone.

The STTMP-DC is suppose to restore Robert Wise's (director of Sound of Music, Andromeda Strain, Day the Earth Stood Still, etc. ) true original vision; no longer being hampered by budgetary demands.  While there are some scenes I believe should have been preserved, it is still an infinitely superior version; far better pacing and additional effects that allows us to take in what previously could only be hinted at.

Some have attacked STTMP and stated that this is the lesser of the six movies (did anybody see #5?).  Less or not, this is as close as one get's to Roddenberry's true vision.  I've actually heard the man in person at those speech/lectures that he would sometimes give around the country.  Star Trek may have started out as ""Gunsmoke"" among the stars, but it apparently became much more for him later on.  For him, Star Trek was about the ""human adventure""; man's exploration of himself and the universe around him.  The other 5 movies were much more ""studio"" formula projects.  Good stories, but I imagine if Roddenberry was calling all of the shots (ie George Lucas), we would have never seen Star Treks #3 and #5.  Think about it, part of the human condition is death, so Spock would have never been resurrected in #3 and according to Star Trek's ""bible"", Spock was an only child, so there goes the story-line for #5.  Like it or not, if people want to know what Star Trek is suppose to be (being true to Roddenberry's vision), STTMP is it; not the other nine movies or the wreck that Abrams created (actually, I have been thinking of a storyline that would restore the original Star Trek's timeline and...bring back peace to our galaxy  ;-)  ).

If you have to have Blu-ray, go ahead.  My suggestion, if you already have them, particularly in their Director's Cuts, don't waste your money.  For those of you wanting the set for the ""round table"" disc, wait.  Netflix will eventually have it so you can rent, or, maybe Amazon will have it in their ""streaming"" catalog.",1267747200,6,3340,4.708620689655173

I'm seeing details that I never knew existed! The colors are crisp and bright. The details are almost too sharp.

And that's my biggest ""issue"" with the video quality. Images are so sharp and clear, that the comparatively poor quality of the FX shots really come out. Likewise, some of the cheesiness of the sets and costumes also comes through. Granted, this is a product of the FX technology and not the BR, so its not a real problem. Overall, this is a good problem.

The real problem is the audio quality. Lots of volume juggling will be required. Otherwise, sounds are also crisp and clear.

3784994,1,B001S3GDT0,"What's wrong with this product?
 so far I watche the motion picture known as star trek 1

and I seen things Missing and missing dialog and content.

If you have it on original and 25th aniv. VHS tape you will see the new boxed set DVD is a butchered messed up redo of the classic movie.

the scene with ilia and sulu and decker ont the bridge is missing. the trasporter scene with kirk asking the crew that beamed up what was the problem down there?

in referance to why Mccoy did not beam up.

to add more insults the audio was changed like when scotty talks to kirk abut the wormhole in the original it is scotty is loud and clear in the new one its low with echo.

the scene with ilea, mccoy, decker and chaple are also different and compaired to the clasic original movie and it is hacked up too.

and so is the scene where kirk is on the bridge and v-ger attacks earth and asks ilea why?

I lay odds- 20-1 that 2-6 are butchered too and 50-50 odds the other box set the next generation motion picture set is  no different.

when it comes to the new original box set for you clasic star trek fans if you have it on Vhs your better off copy it to dvd if you want to save your self money and heart break on movies that were butcherd and hacked up.

now i seen the star trek 3 and noticed the enterprise arival dialog won't play on my dvd but on when played on a portable the Enterprise arival is heard.

now with star trek 6 a part was cut out in the original vhs tape after scotty shoots the Klingon and the body was checked by a star fleet officer and warf the klingon lawyer he says this is not klingon blood then the mask in pulled and col. west was shown to be the sniper that scotty shot adding another member to the plot to keep peace from happening.

and the rescue plan scene also in star trek 6 was removed.
let me explain the missing clip as the three ambassidors are asked to leave 3 starfleet command officers enter adm. carthright  col west and another man and they lay out a rescue plan that is a full scale assult on the klingon home world

the starfleet academy bio's in the bonus sections are not worth the time to watch.",1262736000,7,2141,4.110576923076923

The seventh disk, The Captain Summit, is very interesting and valuable for your collection. I really did enjoy it.

A couple of caveats though. First, the ""primitive"" special effects from the 80s look really awful on high resolution, particularly for the first movie (though I guess die hard trekkers will not mind), as digital images magnify the roughness of the simpler SFx of that time (e.g. the small shuttle going around the docked Enterprise made my children laugh a lot), and second, the digital sound is great, but the volume is so high that sometimes you can hardly listen to the dialogue.

3784998,4,B001S3GDT0,"I would first like to say that I love the Star Trek movies for some of their stories,as they did a remarkable job at returning most of the original crew back to the big screen. I would like to say to all you fellow trekies be prepared for a disappointment in this blu ray dvd box set release. The first two movies Star Trek The Motion Picture and The Wrath of Khan,are Theatrical versions and not the Directors versions. You won't be able to view the additional footage that was cut out, such as the view of Vejur from outer space as the cloud disappears over earth, or the additional footage of Scotty and his first mate as the ship is under attack. One movie which I totally was disappointed with was William Shatner's directorial debut of The Final Frontier movie. I found it had a weak story,lacked adventure,excitement,and could have had some more big stars and enemies from the original series to create a better story. I found the movie to be very cheesie.

As for the quality of the movie transfers there good as could be expected for the age of the material. I do feel that Paramount could have spent a little more time on improving the product before putting it out on shelves. Like any movie company they push the product out there, and next thing they put another box set out there in a year or too with an even better picture, sound quality and extras. Nothing like double dipping.

Paramount has a web site dedicated to Blu Rays. This is where you would register for BD LIVE in order to have access through your Blu Ray player for the added features. After doing some investigating into this site it states that Paramount BD LIVE is only available to US RESIDENTS. Needless to say I contacted my Blu Ray manufacturer they told me to insert an SD CARD into my player. After following my manufactures instructions BD LIVE is working now...!

So for those who have bought Paramount movies, and a warning comes up that you have no internet connection is it's because the SD card is required. BD LIVE will work only after you insert an SD CARD, and is available to us Canadians...!",1262131200,,2090,4.494736842105263

It's all 6 Star Trek Movies with lots of extras on each disk, including commentary. I don't own the DVDs so I don't know if it's all new stuff, but for me it is. The 7th disk (which claims to be new never before seen)is an interview hosted by Whooppie Goldberg with Picard, Riker, Kirk, and Spok (forgive my mis-spelling) I found part 1 a little boring with parts 2 and 3 more humorous.
So for the advid fan you may already own all 6 movies, if you currently own the VHS I'd recommending up grading to this set on Blue-ray. If you have been holding out then this is the set to get.

Star Trek II- Wrong Colors but the grain structure is intact and pleasant to the eyes, and the only reel restoration in the set.  The only film restored from its original negative and not a vaulted print.

Star Trek III a bit bright but otherwise Perfect

Star Trek IV Too Much DVNR again

Star Trek V the best this film has ever looked on DVD

Star Trek VI substandard old transfer from an old HD scan, edge enhancement artifacts and less than sharp image.

Special Features are nothing really.  The Captain's Summit is basically worthless Banter instead of Interesting stories and repetition of what stories these stars have told before.  Nice to see Shatner and Stewart, Nimoy and Frakes on the same stage. None of the special features from the 2 disc sets or special editions have been carried over, no trailers, or old commentaries either or making of and no deleted scenes.

We FINALLY get Trek VI in the proper 2.35:1 ratio.  AND the original cut, as the inserted bits only turn a benign President into a double-dealing creep unworthy of the Federation.  (not to mention the 2-disc ""Director's Cut"" release, which changes even more around, including the mind meld scene to the point the emotive effect is lost.)

We FINALLY get ""The Motion Picture"" in original form, warts and all.  The special DVD release prior to this one has CGI f/x that are rather good, but replacing an understandably repetitive computer voice with this cheap voice and klaxon -- no way was the director involved with that change; it's horrible.  Ditto for hacking up a few scenes that didn't need to be truncated...

""Khan"" definitely shows a proper film cleanup job, even on standard-def.

The other movies look and sound great, especially for being standard-def releases!  These cuts came were minted from the same masters used for the Blu-ray sets, so we won't notice any negative differences, but Blu-ray users will.  Go read their reviews:  Blu-ray users are right in being disappointed in that only ""Khan"" was given the full restoration and the others given half-baked, upconverted ""remastering"" treatment.  (Tangential question:  Did Generation-Y do the work for all of these new releases?  They're all said to be lazy...  Assuming the work was done by Americans, in this global day and age AND where ""'good enough' is good enough"" is just good enough, it can be done by anybody anywhere and if people don't care, a poor quality product is the result.  But that's the gripe for the blu-ray set and not relevant here.  Since the resolution isn't being upconverted, the problems there don't apply.  :-D  )

All in all, this is a fine release for people not desiring to go blu-ray or at least until blu-ray players are affordable and when Paramount can put out all 6 movies in a format that natively makes the best use OF blu-ray, which for now is only ""Khan"" that will.  Even if you've bought all the other sets, these do look and sound better, and were what were shown in the movie theaters to begin with.  Theatrical purists will indeed love this set.",1258675200,20,2182,4.824797843665769
3785015,5,B001S3GDT0,"The Motion Picture had been out of print for quite a while, and I was wondering how and why Paramount would put that out of print, of course they released the Blu-Ray version of this set earlier, which I was kind of upset about because I don't have Blu-Ray, and I wanted these movies really bad on DVD, so a few months ago I bought Star Trek 'The Motion Picture' trilogy, but of course it only had 'The Wrath of Khan' 'The Search for Spock' 'The Voyage Home' and while I knew what movies it had with it, I was disappointed kind of, 'cause I wanted 'The Motion Picture' with it.

Well, finally a few months later, they released the standard definition version, I was very pleased when I had found out they did, it was on the top of my list to get (along with 'The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection, which I bought a few weeks ago), and they did a great job with that one, so I knew this one would be just as good...and it is.

You get all 6 motion pictures of course, as well as a bonus disc 'Captains Summit', which I have not watched yet, I will when I watch all the movies, of which 2 I hadn't seen before 'The Final Frontier' and 'The Undiscovered Country', and I watched them both last night, and I was very happy with them, I find 'The Final Frontier' to be very underrated, and 'The Undiscovered Country' was the perfect way to say goodbye (although in 'Generations' from 'The Next Generation' we saw Captain Kirk, Chekov, and Scotty one final time).

As for 'The Motion Picture' I find this one to be criminally underrated, I think it is a great start for the movie series, I guess I saw more than most other people saw in it, and even after seeing it countless times in my teens, it just never gets old, great underrated movie.

As for the trilogy part 'The Wrath of Khan' 'The Search for Spock' 'The Voyage Home', these were the most successful movies in the series, with good reason, it's just an awesome three part adventure, epic, full of action, great acting of course, and great stories, everything a Star Trek fan could ask for.

I can never get enough of Star Trek...well, aside from 'Deep Space Nine' and 'Enterprise'.

To me, Star Trek is and will always be 'The Original Series' 'The Next Generation' and 'Voyager'.

Bottom line, fans, buy this set, it is well worth the price paid for it, it pays for itself, and if you buy this set (and like it), what Star Trek fan wouldn't? I suggest buying 'The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection' as well, as it's just as nice as this.

3785016,4,B001S3GDT0,"I just got this and haven't finished ST 1 yet but this is what I have noticed.  Some scenes look great while others not so great.  In the beginning where the Enterprise is leaving spacedock there are a few big black spots that appear on the enterprise and I mean BIG.  I can't beleive that these were allowed in the transfer.  Also, when the Entperise has entered V'Ger and Kirk tells Sulu to take them 500 meters above and 200 meters out there are three smaller black spots on all the outside shots of the enterprise in the scene.  When they go to interior shots they look ok.  The other thing I have noticed is that when a character is the main focus visually for a scene, almost everything outside of the focus is highly blurry.  Not sure if this is the same on the VHS and DVD releases.  I'm gonna check this but it is kind of annoying.

As for the movie itself, by not including a lot of the extra scenes the movie seems to jump and not make sense at some points.  Also, the deleted scenes are included as extras but not all the extra scenes from the directors cut made it to the deleted scenes section.

3785019,3,B001S3GDT0,"All of the films should have been expertly restored, possibly with some special effects re-created (to look just like the original only with flaws fixed, see some of the technical issues others reviewers have pointed out), visible make-up could possibly be improved with colour alteration on selected scenes, and much more. The bottom line is Paramount just don't want to spend the money required to do this, so that they can maximise their profits. Just take a look at the excellent restoration job done on Blade Runner, Original film cleaned, scanned at highest possible resolution, each scene carefully looked at and restored, for example one shots shows a hovering police car that previously you could see the wires supporting it, now carefully painted out. Had the same care and attention (and money) been spent on restoring each of the Star Trek films, they would no doubt look a lot better. At least KHAN was restored, but not to the same degree that Blade Runner was.

The Studio may do a restoration at a later date so they can sell it to us all again. Look at the way Paramount has consistantly milked fans of their money with so many different releases of the Star Trek Series and Films, what a contrast to Star Wars, yes there have been a few versions over the years as improvements were made, but on DVD, basically one quality release of each film with plenty of extras at a fair price. Respect to George Lucas for not over milking us of our money. Shame on you Paramount, you are charging enough for the Blu-Rays and you have made huge profits from Star Trek over the years, give a little back by spending the required ammount to do the best possible restorations, you owe it to the film makers and the fans!

3785041,4,B001S3GDT0,"One would be hard pressed to find films that have gotten more treatment on video than the Star Trek franchise.  This review only covers the quality of the Blu-Ray release.  I've written separate reviews of the individual films under their titles.

The image quality of the The Motion Picture is spectacular, easily eclipsing the Director's Edition DVD, which in turn was a vast improvement over the LaserDisk, which was better than any of the VHS versions.  Indeed, this Blu-ray version even looks better than the original theatrical print - which was so rushed into theaters that it wasn't properly color timed.  (Strangely, the Klingon and Vulcan subtitles are not burned into the film as in all previous transfers, but are part of the Blu-Ray subtitles.)  The visual effects are the greatest beneficiary of this improvement, particularly during the V'ger sequences.  But two caveats: the image is now so clear that flaws in the visuals (especially those dealing with compositing) are very obvious.  Also, this is the Theatrical cut, a rush job which suffered from poor pacing, lack of sound effects, and incomplete visual sequences.  The scene near the end where the crew emerges from the Enterprise is painful to watch.  Hopefully, Paramount will pony up the money to have the Director's Cut visuals re-rendered in high definition and make a Blu-ray available of that.  Until then, I'm holding on to my Director's Edition DVD.

The Wrath of Khan is the only film in this set to have been fully restored - and it needed it.  Due to the film's popularity, so many prints were struck that the printing master was damaged.  This, again, is the theatrical cut (except the ""II"" didn't appear in the title when it ran in theaters).  The restoration reveals a lot of detail, such as the fabric in the redesigned uniforms, and set backgrounds.  The color balance has also been improved - it was previously too red tinted.

The Search for Spock looks slightly better than the DVD, but the difference is hardly striking.  Perhaps the fact that the film was less popular than II has resulted in less damage to the master print.

The Voyage Home, the most popular Trek film in real dollars, has looked terrible on home video.  The initial VHS tapes were nearly unwatchable, and even the 1990s Laserdisc used a print that had looked like it was dragged across the floor.  The DVD improved matters and this Blu-Ray is even better.

I don't much care for The Final Frontier, but I watched a few sections of it.  Again, more detail is revealed for good (the early scenes at Yosemite National Park) and ill (some of the optical effects).

This marks the first time The Undiscovered Country has been released on video in the original theatrical cut.  Thus, the film loses the Operation Retrieve subplot and renegade Colonel West character (a sly reference to Lt. Colonel Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety).  I'll be holding onto my regular DVD of this film for those few minutes, cut under pressure from Paramount, which thought the political commentary was too on the nose.  This disc is a case where Blu-ray can reveal too much.  The visual effects look fine, but the improved definition reveals the extent to which the studio was trying to conceal the actors' aging.  This is especially the case with Leonard Nimoy, whose makeup appears to have been applied with a trowel.

There have been complaints about excessive Digital Noise Reduction.  There were some sections where it seems a bit overdone: an establishing shot of the Enterprise inside V-ger, which now looks like a still photo, for example.  But for the most part these films look great.

The sound mix on all films is first rate, with dialogue strongly placed front & center, and proper use of surround.  Unlike previous DVD issues, the films are now available with French and Spanish soundtracks (the latter not too good, according to my spouse, a native Spanish speaker).

The features partly duplicate those from the 2 discs DVD versions, with a few removed and some new features added.  The Starfleet Academy feature is useless and quite annoying.  The Captain's Summit is an enjoyable get together with Shatner, Nimoy, Patrick Stewart and Jonathan Frakes, loosely moderated by Whoopi Goldberg.  Ardent Trek fans will learn nothing new, and even hear Shatner say (for the umpteenth time) that the Enterprise Bridge set was destroyed after each film was complete, and had to be rebuilt for each sequel (not true).  There are also additional commentaries, which run the gamut from amusing (the Okudas, Reeves-Stevens, Dochterman commentary for The Motion Picture and The Final Frontier) to irritating (Manny Coto's contribution to The Wrath of Khan commentary borders on snotty).",1254787200,4,4734,4.951837769328264

I thought this might help, as there is very little info from Amazon on this product. This review is mostly for the content of this STANDARD DEFINITION 7 Disc ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE COLLECTION Box Set released Sept. 22, 2009.

Obviously, these are the 6 Original Paramount films with the Original Series cast.

STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE
THE WRATH OF KHAN
THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK
THE VOYAGE HOME
THE FINAL FRONTIER
and THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY

Every film in this set is the Original Widescreen Theatrical Version. The 7th Bonus Disc is THE CAPTAINS' SUMMIT. A 70 minute round table discussion with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, and host Whoopi Goldberg.

Each Movie Disc includes commentaries, a few short Special Features, and NO theatrical trailers. The Insert Card states: 2 1/2 hours of Special Features. My guess is that they're leftovers from the previous 2 Disc Editions for each film, none of which I've ever owned. So, don't take my word for it. (Anyone that thinks 5 Stars may be too generous for this Edition, I only really care about the films. And, the way they look and sound. SFs are of secondary concern to me.)

Sound for all the films is 5.1 Dolby Digital EX and maintains a good presence. There is NO 2.1 or DTS setting. As usual with big studio blockbusters, music is too far forward in the mix for my taste, and dialogue is at a lower volume. (For optimal home theater playback, your center channel should always be set at a hotter level than your front speakers. Here's a good starting point for louder films: The individual speaker volume levels for my surround receiver go to 12. Please, no Spinal Tap jokes. I usually leave my L/R front speakers at level 4, and make my center channel all-the-way hot at 12. I always leave my rear effects speakers at 8 or 10. My Velodyne subwoofer is usually set at -7 because I have neighbors, and the darn thing really pumps those ultra low earthquake frequencies.)

The transfers look EXCELLENT. I've perused them all, but I have only viewed the FIRST film in its entirety. Very nice. Good color timing. (NOSTALGIA ALERT: I really appreciate the primitive Special Effects, models, matte painting, and miniature photography of this era. With the advent of CG, these kinds of photographic effects are a rarity these days. The wormhole sequence is still awesome, and the VGER probe scene still looks really cool. I can't wait to view the rest of the films. Especially THE WRATH OF KHAN!)

This Box Set is a very handsome Edition. Each Disc comes in an ultra thin slipcase with a different cast member in silver on the cover of each case, with Shatner's photo on the Bonus Disc. (I would have preferred the Original movie poster art for each film, but the design is unique for this Edition.)

The Box has a 3D Trek logo on the front, is only 2"" deep, and doesn't take up much shelf space. The entire Box is covered with a transparent slipcover that is open on the top and bottom. (CAREFUL: The insert card is glued to the outside and the bottom of the Box. If it comes off, the entire Box can fall thru the bottom of the outer slipcover and crash onto the floor. Remove it, put it under the slipcover, or throw it away.)

A very affordable way to own the 6 Original films.

SPOCK LIVES!

3785046,5,B001S3GDT0,"I don't understand why people give this set such low ratings. I have not watch the original set produced back in the days, but after watching the blu-ray set i became a fan all over again! the quality of all these movies gave me the feeling that they were made recently. I really enjoy the set so i really can't understand why others rated in such way, unless they got a different set.
So if you like Star Trek i really recommend this set to you",1253059200,6,445,4.186046511627907
3785047,5,B001S3GDT0,"For the asking price on Amazon, nearly half the original price, this is a huge deal for the sorts of things normally accumulated in Blu Ray collections.

Without reviewing the individual movies (You can see me do that in the DVD versions.  Except ""The Motion Picture"", because quite frankly, the Director's Cut by all accounts was a huge difference and improvement), I'll just say that despite Wrath of Khan being claimed to be the only TRULY digitally remastered and true Blu Ray quality, it actually looks among the worst of them all.  Though that's not saying it looks like trash---it looks incredible, of course.  But compared to the others, ""Wrath of Khan"" has the most visual dirt and detractments.

Some of the others, though, look as though they were remastered from the DVD versions, in that they seem to feel artificially boosted in picture quality.  I think that's only my own opinion, based entirely upon two scenes from ""Search for Spock"" and a few from ""The Final Frontier"", but for the most part, they are all incredible.  And despite what another reviewer says, ""The Voyage Home"" does not look overly muted in color; it's the same as all the others.

All the discs start with the same trailers for Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Season 1 on Blu Ray.  Despite what people say, these were totally skippable for me, just by pressing ""Next"".  I'm on a Sony Blu Ray player, so this may just be something only I am able to do.

The sound quality is mostly great, but I've found for the majority of the films, there's the problem of what I saw prominently in the Star Wars Trilogy DVD release in 2004---the dialogue switches back and forth at times from sounding Stereo to Mono.  This might not affect most people, but due to my highly sensitive hearing, it's rather jarring to hear the traditional Mono track sound of Kirk saying something, then all of a sudden, his next lines are in Stereo, which sounds much closer, clearer, and digital.

I can't really explain it further, but the most precise example of this I can recommend is from the original 2004 DVD of ""Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope""---in the scene where Luke is training with Obi-Wan on the Millenium Falcon, and Han Solo walks in saying they don't have to worry about the Imperial cruisers anymore.  That line is in Mono.  Immediately afterwards, he says ""Don't everybody thank me at once"" which is in Stereo.

Perhaps it's my own opinion after not being badly turned off from ""The Final Frontier"" but the only film which suffers the most is ""The Motion Picture"".  Due to its not being the Director's Cut, the vast majority of the visual effects range from ""Decent for it's time"" to a complete catastrophe.  While the gaseous cloud surrounding V'ger in the opening sequence looked real enough, when the Klingon Birds of Prey flew over them, it completely ruined the effect, due to the ships having VERY THICK black outlines, and scratchiness across the darker portions of it.  The worst, though, would have to be the scene Scotty and Kirk going aboard the Enterprise on a shuttle, and giving us a shot of them from the outside.  Their images look like the front of the shuttle has an old TV on it, broadcasting an image of the two of them, and it looks extremely jarring against the rest of the shot.

As well, the same problems plagueing the Season 1 Blu Rays plague much of the movies---the music and sound effects are loud as hell, and the dialogue is very quiet in comparison.  This reaches its worst peak in ""The Final Frontier"".

Special features abound, including most of those from the 2-disc DVD releases.  Although I'm not sure it would worth replacing the DVDs for an ULTIMATE collector, as I think there may be features discluded from the release, particularly things regarding the ""The Motion Picture"" Director's Cut.",1252886400,,3807,4.690225563909775

3785073,3,B001S3GDT0,"The picture and sound are great (for the most part, though there are black level issues and some more cleaning up that could've been done), but the content isn't only a retread of the DVD releases, they're all the theatrical releases.  For exemple, the Director's Cut of that snoozefest 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is superior to the horrible theatrical release, but it's not included here because Paramount, no doubt, is planning to release directors' cuts and special editions in order to entice fans to shell out more money.  I predict those future BDs will each have customized disk menus, unlike these BDs which have the exact same menu on each disk, and new content.  The only thing new here is the Captains Summit which doesn't even include all the captains of all the shows... where are Janeway and Archer?  (Though it is fun to watch William Shatner in all his manic craziness and hear Patrick Stewart talk about what an ""ass"" he was at the beginning of TNG.)

Yes, I am one of the suckers who bought this BD set, but I've seen the movies so many, many times in all their formats I don't watch them very often anymore, anyway.  It is a shame Paramount hasn't invited any of the original cast members other than William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy to contribute to commentaries; those actors remained in those roles for so long because they, too, had fan followings and I'm sure Uhura's fans or Sulu's fans would have greatley appreciate it.  Perhaps DeForrest Kelley died before they started recording DVD commentaries (though I have a feeling he probably would have been invited to record one or more), but imagine what anecdotes the late James Doohan would have told about his days on the set, stories now lost forever.

Shame on me for not researching this BD set more thoroughly before buying.

3785076,5,B001S3GDT0,"I was skeptical at first, reading all of the pre-release ""reviews"" badmouthing this set, but I am very glad I ordered. The movies look amazing in HD, and it is a real treat to see them in their original theatrical format. I'll write a brief blurb on each below:

Star Trek I - After becoming used to the Director's Edition over the past few years, I was sure I'd be disappointed by the theatrical version, but instead I found it a true masterpiece. To me, this film had the clearest picture, at least until I watched Star Trek VI. Hands down, the sound on this film beat all others easily. The soundtrack with the symphony orchestra and James Horner's score sounds beautiful. Visually I did not miss the Director's Edition updated effects shots at all. In fact, given the choice between the two now, I would prefer the original, as the shots in the Director's Edition can look a little bit overdone when considering the context of when the film was made and the overall style.

Star Trek II - If I had to choose a disappointment with this set, this would be it. I still give the set 5 stars, but unfortunately Wrath of Khan's picture and sound were underwhelming for a blu-ray release. As some critics have suggested, it probably has to do with the restoration of the film and subsequent remastering. While still superior to the dvd release, the image is not as sharp and sound not as powerful as the other films. It's sad to think that the original source must have been that far gone.

Star Trek III - This is probably the least exciting of all the movies, but picture was good and sound just as good as the others, even in the bright, hazy scenes on Vulcan. There was no distortion as there would be on dvd.

Star Trek IV - It was a real treat to see this on blu-ray since this was the first of the Trek movies I saw in the theater. Watching Kirk and co. run amuck in S.F. in high-def in the 80s is a real visual time capsule, and very enjoyable to watch.

Star Trek V - I've always felt this movie got a bum rap. It is cheesey and hokey, and the ""search for god"" actually ties back to a theme in the first movie, but the picture quality was excellent, and sound was especially good. Especially during the Sha Ka Ree scenes with the ""god""-being. It was fun to see the detail in all the scenes, ESPECIALLY in the opening scenes filmed on location in Yosemite. The film is good for a few chuckles and shakes of the head, why not enjoy them in high def?

Star Trek VI - This had the absolute best picture quality. Sound was clear and crisp, though nothing special. This film didn't have the grandeur of some of the earlier ones as far as sound is concerned (Like I, IV or V), so it's not a knock on the quality of the blu-ray, just a fact about the film. I'm guessing this one really shined from a picture perspective owing to its relatively younger age.

All in all, I highly recommend this set. If you enjoy HD movies on blu-ray and are even a casual Trek fan, you will enjoy it!",1248652800,3,2981,4.2935943060498225
3785077,5,B001S3GDT0,"I can't possibly think of much more that can be added that hasn't been said but I will try. Some reviews are almost completely technical-oriented-ignoring what the everyday casual fan/viewer might think. Other reviews are based on what viewers 'think' movies on blu should look like (that they should be completely grain-free) and neglect the techincal aspects...I will try to bridge both together for this review/opinion.

First off, I think the quality of the packaging is very nice. Some people complain about the uniformality of the discs and while the on-screen menus on the discs are all similar they do show the individual title of each film on each disc. However, this is a boxed set so I like how the disc cases and the on-screen menus are uniform (and they don't look cheesy at all IMHO). There is a preview for the new 2009 'Star Trek' and for the TOS coming out on blu on each of the discs but I was able to bypass these right away with my menu buttons on my blu ray remote and go right to the menu.

As for the films themselves...

I am one of those people who grew up watching TOS re-runs on T.V. as a kid and fell in love. When the movies came out on VHS I bought them all, watched them constantly and memorized all the lines. When they came out on DVD I was there buying them all and then again when they had the Special Editions and Director's Cuts. Just as the DVD releases had their own problems, the positives far outweighed the negatives and this is exactly how I end up feeling toward this blu ray release of the first six Trek films.

Before getting too specific I will say that I have been through all six films and I found each to look much, much better than any previous version I have seen to this point. I'm not going to deny there may have been things done to the films to make them more enjoyable to the blu ray viewer who may be more interested in a clear, sleek looking picture, but when I put these discs in I was truly wowed...especially after what I have read in some of the reviews.

The first clarification I will make is that all of these films are shown in HD. Perhaps Paramount should have worded the packaging differently but by now most people understand that all of the films (except TWOK) have been transfered and remastered in HD. TWOK alone was restored and remastered (meaning they went back to do an entirely new transfer from a negative instead of using one that already existed). I could really delve into tech speak at this point in the whole process, but it's already been done so let's talk about how the movies look and sound.

TMP looks (and sounds) just incredible. The difference from the SE DVD to blu is drastic and looks far better than the SE DVD shown in upconverted format. I will admit it almost looks too clear and smooth for the purist (and I understand their complaint) but it's far better than any previous version I have ever seen; it's kind of an 8 steps forward 2 steps back kind of thing but overall I was amazed. As for the complaints about DNR on these films I am not saying it was not used, but as someone who has seen each of these films hundreds of times I found myself seeing far more detail and noticing far more new things and not once noticed anything that was lost as far as detail (and this goes for the entire six films in this set).

Because of the clarity and detail you do notice a lot more 'issues' in TMP that look bad or out of focus but this is the direction and photographic effects of the filming and not the transfer. In addition, some composite shots with special effects in them still look grainy due to the way these were filmed in those days but there isn't much that can be done without damaging the detail of the shot (which tells me they were thoughtful not to over use filters, DNR in the processing of the film for blu). One example in TMP is the scene in which the 'probe' from V'ger comes onto the Enterprise and ends up taking Lt. Ilia. The quality of this scene looks no better than what was on DVD but once the shot is over the amazing blu ray picture comes back once the effects shots are done. This is more distracting than before but all the other parts are so good I am not swayed otherwise.

The only real problem I have seen in TMP are tracking shots of the Enterprise leaving spacedock and a few other exterior shots of the ship-there are these odd, stationary black spots in the picture that look like they must be on the print as they are in the same place on the various 5 or 6 tracking shots of the ship in different places throughout the film.

Yes I understand why people might be mad the Director's Cut is not included, but personally I like the Theatrical version better-heck, I wish the extended cut was included on blu but we do at least get the deleted scenes from that cut on this disc. And, there is the issue of the resolution of the new effects that were added to the DC version not being suitable for blu.

I do wonder why the same people who refuse to purchase this set because they are irritated by the films not being an accurate, true representation as far as being accurate transfers go are not upset about the fact that both visual and audio special effects were cut and added to TMP when they released the Director's Cut. I find this contradictory to be so concerned about preserving the original film so perfectly but feeling it ok to add in special effects, cut scenes and change sound effects years later. All IMHO of course.

TWOK: The beginning of this film does look bad as some have said-it looks no better than an upconverted DVD for the first part of the film.  After the first few minutes though the image becomes much better. There is grain throughout but it seems like a very 'natural' grain. I think this film best represents what the critics on both sides are complaining about: On one hand for the purist this is probably the best, truest transfer of the set with the least amount of DNR/filtering. However, to those who want the clear, grain-free picture this film probably looks the worst of the set (but still much better than any DVD versions). Detail and color are still far superior in every way. So the purists will wish all of the films looked like this one and all of those wanting grain-free images will want it the way TMP looks.

A quick mention about the hue/color timing of TWOK. This is a much 'cooler' look than previous DVDs but after watching TWOK and TSFS back-to-back I find the color hue and timing of TWOK to be much, much more consistant with that of TSFS so I was very pleased. I always thought the early DVD versions of TWOK were much warmer than I remembered the film being.

As for the remaining films I found them similar in quality...kind of between TMP and TWOK. They were not quite as clear as TMP but did not contain as much grain as TWOK. Again, composite shots with effects in them still have some grain and stand out, but every movie in the set is far superior visually to anything I have yet seen. I didn't notice enough difference between III, IV, V and VI other than that III seemed perhaps just a bit sharper than the rest and it was a pleasure to see planet Genesis come alive in sound, color and detail. Some have said that the shots of San Francisco in TVH didn't come alive as much as they had hoped but it was still far, far better than the most recent DVD and I would say was an easily discernable improvement.

The only other main issue I have read and seen is regarding some of the capture photos many have posted up on the web showing what looks to be waxy faces, heavy DNR and filters applied to shots. I have seen these shots and was actually worried and was second guessing buying this set. However, while watching the films I never noticed any scene looking as bad as any of the screen captures show. I'm not saying they are not real captures, but I was simply unable to pick this out or notice this during my viewing the film and I was looking for it in the spots/scenes I have seen these screen captures from. Perhaps on a very large screen it is noticible but on my 32"" LCD I did not notice this (I am only about 5 feet away from the screen so I am still relatively close).

So, from someone who was very hesitant, without reservation I recommend this set. With the quality that I see in these films I was very happy (even excited) seeing and hearing each film. It's a pretty comprehensive set so I would not expect Paramount revisiting these on blu anytime soon. I do understand the complaints from the purists and I began watching these as a skeptic but I was unable to really pick out any noticable issues that have been brought up. Again, 8 steps forward for the detail and picture, 2 steps back for no Director's Cuts (when possible) and for the issues like the purists mention. Compared to the DVDs, this is still a 5-star product.

Hope this helps those sitting on the fence leaning one way or the other.",1248566400,20,8919,4.353577871316897
3785078,3,B001S3GDT0,"I don't have many complaints about the video quality of the HD video transfer, overall it's pretty good.  The film transfer for ""Undiscovered Country"" could have been better, film jitter was easily noticeable.  Some of the older movies don't look too much better than upscaled DVD's, but that probably can't be helped.  In the case of Star Trek III, the HD transfer is so faithful to the original movie that one can easy see the compositing artifacts for some of the special effects, making them even more distracting.  (For example, the clipping boundaries around the Enterprise while it's entering and leaving the space station.)  That being said, it was neat being able to clearly make out fine details for movies which I'd previously only been able to see only  in standard definition.

The main menus are all the same canned 3D animation of the federation insignia, set to theme music from each movie.  Thus, they offer almost no ""flavor"" and are pretty boring.  Most frustrating is that each disc automatically plays a trailer for the new Star Trek movie (not even the ""best"" trailer), followed by another for the HD release of the original series.  I can forgive an automated advertising assault when I buy used DVD's which were probably once rental DVD's.  However, when it's something I purchased new, it feels like a big corporate slap in the face, every time I see it.  It gets old real quick--real classy, Paramount.

I am somebody who almost bought Star Trek - Original series 3 times, one time on DVD (for $90 a season), one time on HD-DVD and one time on BluRAY. I am tired of them milking this.

That being said, I don't believe this set deserves a star only because of the Paramount milking it and most important without seeing it.
I have seen 5 of the 6 movies and they look great. Everybody makes a big thing from the fact that they restored only the Wrath of Khan. Let me tell you this, from the 4 movies I've seen, the Wrath of Khan looks the worst. No joke... Maybe they restored it because it was crappy before... Just look close at the scenes from the container (at the beginning of the movie) with Khan, Checkov and the captain. The transfer is really bad with a lot of optic/lens distortions.

I think this set is good and the only complain is that they did not pack all the Star Trek movies together, including also the ones with Picard.

3785115,5,B001S3GDT0,"I will eventually fill this space in with more-detailed comments, but I have to remark on the issue of the ""restoration"" of ST2.

Paramount made a mistake in announcing that it had been ""restored"". The implication was that all the films needed restoration (to some degree) and the others had not been restored.

The opposite, of course, is true. ST2 was restored because it apparently needed it. It is the (relatively) worst-looking of these films: slightly soft, and with not-quite-right color. It is, nevertheless, really good-looking, and worth the BD transfer.

""Star Trek: the Motion Picture"" needs some defending. It suffers from less-than-snappy dialog, and a groan-inducing ending to a story whose theme has been explored in hundreds of science-fiction works. Yet, it is one of the most-beautiful motion pictures I have ever seen, capturing a real sense of the mystery and wonder of the universe, something rarely seen in SF films. And it has Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent score, a true masterpiece, which both complements and enriches the film.

The deleted bits that appear in the ""Director's Cut"" are included as a supplement. They add nothing to the film, but in a movie so lacking humor, it would be nice to have Ilya's line ""I will not take advantage of sexually immature species"" restored.

I saw ST:tMP in first run, and the Blu-ray transfer is a meaningful improvement on what I saw in the theater. Even if you think you don't like the film, give the Blu-ray a chance. Heck, where else are you going to see Deforest Kelly with a thick, ""I wanna grab it"" beard?",1245715200,2,1577,4.891385767790262

All are the original theatrical releases, and all look good and sound good, especially considering they are all 20+ year old movies (how is that even possible?). If you are a Trek fan this is easily the best looking and sounding release versions of these films you are currently going to find.

The only complaint I have is that they are ONLY the theatrical releases. I would have preferred that they seamlessly branch, ala the remastered Season One Blu-Ray set, between the Director's/Special Edition versions and these theatrical versions. Paramount will just put out that set in another couple of years. Completely understandable from a business point of view, but extremely annoying from a consumer point of view.

They did a great job with this and it deserves nothing less than a 5 Star Rating. If your a Star Trek fan or respect the science fiction classics this is a must have for your collection!,1245283200,2,777,4.0519480519480515

Well, after watching Star Trek the Motion Picture on Blu Ray after a several years' hiatus I can claim to be half right about my thoughts. The movie does lack the general humor that is so important to the flow and chemistry of the characters.. however in place of that you have a movie MUCH more epic and genuinely more grounded than what I remember from here on out.

I think director Robert Wise is more to credit for the true professionalism and less 'camp' than the ensuing sequels.. in many ways this is the true sequel to the series in terms of look; it's quite primitive. Even though exactly 10 years had passed between the series and this movie it looks more like 4 or 5.. and I like that.

It's probably less entertaining on most every level but I was entertained in a few unconventional ways.. like the sets, the story set up, and the transfer. IMO this is a must own movie from a sci fi standpoint if less than a must see from a Star Trek standpoint.

Overall -

8.5 out of 10 for the movie

9.5 out of 10 for the transfer

ST2:

I'm not a huge fan of this movie. Firstly I do not care for the actor playing 'David' and do not believe his performance.. I can't see him as Kirks son for some reason. I've never cared for Kahn's 'Krew'.. the casting seems awkwardly young, plus the 'look' (wardrobe) has never appealed to me. This is a bit too actiony for me, this movie spends too much time for my tastes on either bridges or outward shots of space battles, I prefer the human elements in this series.

I do like the transfer of this movie also, not as consistent as Prt 1 but certainly better than it's ever looked by far. I do think the original cast is in fine form and back to their usual selves but the problem is; aside from Kirk and Spock most have little to do. I must note; I LOVE Montalban, certainly a role for the ages. I actually just prefer watching the series episode 'Space Seed' to this movie.

Overall -

7.5 out of 10 for the movie

8.5 out of 10 for the transfer

I will conclude this review by saying Parts 3 and 4 have the weakest transfer.. Parts 5 and 6 look amazing.. except for some effects shots on 6. Also, going against the grain I really like Part 5 (the movie content). It seems much more character specific than 6.. which may be a better movie, but not a better Star Trek movie IMO.

Please do not let the naysayers sway you.. I sold my first 5 Trek dvds for $48 and got this set of 6 Blu Ray Movies plus the Summit for a song... NO REGRETS. What are you going to do, watch your dvds on your HDTV? Ugh. No Thanks.",1245024000,5,2561,4.157894736842105
3785149,5,B001S3GDT0,I found the Star trek movie collection to be a fantastic buy. They have done a very fine job with the transfer to blu ray. This collection looked 200 times better than I thought it would. Great product.,1245024000,3,202,4.342105263157895
3785150,5,B001S3GDT0,Paramount does a real good job remastering their movies.  This re-release of the class first 5 movies on Bluray is fantastic.  On Bluray you will see new detail you didn't see with basic DVD discs.  The extras is normal nothing spectacular but you shouldnt buy the discs for the extra stuff anyway for me its all about the movie.  Ok the first and third movie are pure garbage I mean we all could have written better movies than the writters for those two movies but the rest is worth the package.,1245024000,,497,4.428571428571429

3785152,4,B001S3GDT0,"Ok I just recieved the boxed set, within 5 days from ordering from Amazon. The packaging is good and a neat litle hologram on the box. Annoyingly the proof of purchase token is on the removable shiny paper backing, well I threw it out, hopefully I'll never need it.

To the meat. Ok so I was excited when this arrived. I'm running this on a fully firmware updated PS3 on a 52"" 1080 Samsung LCD with surround sound.

I watched BD ""The Wrath of Khan"". The sound is really good. Picture, well ok it's clearly HD but not the leap I was expecting. It's not ""Batman Returns"", of course people will say hey it's old. Well I also watched the first Sean Connery BD Bond, ""Dr No"", it looked terrific plus I have both the HD and BD Star Trek Original Series (1) which looks amazing but the HD version had some sound issues.

I then popped in a regular Star Trek DVD for comparison. Honestly maybe I'm missing something it's (the BD version) is just not as good picture wise as I'd expected.

I rely a lot on Amazon reviews, maybe my expectations where too high? But I suspect that with Toshiba paying for the restoration of The Original Series and I guess someone doing the same for Bond, I expected that standard here and it's absent so far. I'll update this as I watch the others. I have no axe to grind and I'm very glad I paid only the $60 or so on Amazon rather than full price. Just a heads up I don't know about some of the reviews, I imagine people want to like this product more, hey I would too.",1244937600,2,1494,4.213286713286713

Amazon had the best price around, although I was disappointed that the price dropped from 79.99 to 69.99 right after the set's official release date.  Was a little concerned about the image quality based on reviews. (Only Wrath of Kahn was fully restored).  I have to disagree with those reviews.  To me, the picture quality of the discs that I have seen so far are all the same.  I did not feel that Wrath of Kahn looked any better than Voyage Home or Undiscovered Country.  I would not hesitate to purchase this set.  Can't wait for the 'TNG' films to come to Blue Ray.",1244592000,,644,4.452991452991453

3785156,4,B001S3GDT0,"I'm a huge Star Trek fan and have been one for eighteen years now. That being said, I actually never owned any of the movies on DVD. I had the first eight movies on VHS but I never got around to buying the films on DVD. By the time I got around to considering buying the set I bought a Playstation 3 and decided to wait until they were released on blu ray.

I'm also a technology buff. I HAVE to have the latest computer, television and video technology. I'm obsessed with being super ""Up to Date"" on that kind of stuff.

So buying the first six movies on Blu Ray was a no brainer to me. I knew the second that I heard the films were going to be released in the Blu-Ray format that I had to buy them. In my mind Star Trek + Blu Ray = the greatest thing ever.
So I was excited about the set but then I read the Amazon.com UK reviews and I had mixed feelings about the release because most of the reviewers said the picture quality wasn't that much better than DVDs. So I thought about the negative reviews a little while and I decided I'd wait until the sets were out here in the States for a couple days before I'd make my purchase. That way I'd have time for a review site or two to post a more thorough review so I wouldn't have to waste my money on something that was considered sub-par if it did indeed turn out being sub-par. So I waited and then I read a couple of rave reviews so I went out and made the purchase and I have to say I am VERY HAPPY with my product so far.

So, to answer your questions, yes the picture is indeed blu ray quality. You put these suckers in your blu ray player and turn on your HDTV and surround sound and you do indeed get the ultimate Star Trek experience. I would even go as to far as to say they look as beautiful as Warner's Blu Ray release of the Batman Anthology. So the movies look and sound great. If you're worried that they'll just look slightly better than DVDs you can put those fears aside. With the exception of Star Trek VI, they all look incredible. Even Star Trek The Motion Picture (the lamest movie in the franchise besides Nemesis and Insurrection) looks incredibly beautiful.
Now you'll notice I said Star Trek VI is the exception. That's true. While it doesn't look like crap necessarily, it more or less just looks like a standard DVD. Nothing overly impressive about it at all. But you know what? For $89 for the whole set, I can live with that. Besides, it's not like Paramount won't release these movies again with additional tweaks. After all, these ARE NOT the Director's Cut versions of the original films so you will have to ""double dip"" sooner or later. And, again, I can live with that because I've been waiting for Star Trek on Blu Ray for quite a while now and am happy to have a ""shelf filler"" set until the definitive editions are released.

So is this the best possible release of the first six movies that we could get on Blu Ray? In terms of the picture and sound quality (with the exception of Star Trek VI) I would have to say yes. Is it the definitive edition to those of you out there who love special features and extras? No. But for what it is and for the low $89 price tag it kicks all kinds of butt and is definitely recommended for the fans out there like myself who don't mind the double dipping.",1244332800,2,3282,4.180094786729858
3785157,4,B001S3GDT0,"I have never before written a review for an item purchased at Amazon, but given the incredible amount of debate about this release, I feel compelled to weigh in. I've had a chance to sample all six films in this set, and I'm absolutely thrilled to be able to upgrade from the DVD versions. The first thing I noticed upon viewing the beginning of STTMP is that the heavy matte lines surrounding the Klingon ships have been removed, making the effect much more natural-looking. In addition, a lot of dirt and grime has obviously been removed, as it has on the other films. The transfers are all clean and sharp; yes, they are somewhat variable, but given the vintage of the films themselves, I think their original look is represented pretty well. DNR doesn't seem excessive to me; some grain was present in all the films, and the transfers all looked very pleasing on my 60-inch Sony. In addition to the generally good job Paramount has done mastering the films for Blu-Ray, I for one think they've also created an excellent package design. The individual thin cases are much preferable to the unwieldy packaging sometimes given multi-disc sets, and the art is tasteful and understated; the box is sturdy, and I like the translucent slipcover. Although I'm sure Paramount will eventually release the director's cuts of TMP, Khan and The Undiscovered Country, I think they deserve a bit of a break from the vehement criticism they've received regarding the presentation of these films. If you're not in love with the director's cuts, this nicely designed set is well worth the upgrade.",1244332800,4,1583,4.845018450184502

Could they look better? Sure, i own other catalog titles that look better, but as someone that loves trek i could not wait and am satisfied with the purchase. I am sure later they will ""double dip"" the movies. Anyway my recommondation is that for the amount of movie and special features you get. It's worth the price of the upgrade.

3785174,4,B001S3GDT0,"I really enjoyed watching the set over the weekend on my 61"" DLP set.  All the complaining by people long before this set was released was much ado about nothing.

In fact, by my eye, the one movie that went through a heavy digital restoring...Star Trek II...looks the worst of the bunch.  Faces are often over-saturated and look colorized.  Some shots are sharp, where others have a softer focus.  You can easily pick out the voice overdubs vs dialogue shot in the scene.  The movie flickers in places the same way it has in every other release.  But most of those examples were really flaws of the original production, so what can you do.

Star Trek VI is just the opposite.  Beautiful, clear, with an awesome soundtrack.  VI was the only movie of the bunch to get a theatrical Dolby Digital 5.1 mix (though it was only used for showcases of the then-new technology).

But for the most part, all six movies look pretty much the way I remember them in their original theatrical runs.  They're not overly sharp and they come from clean sources.  You might see the occasional flaw here and there, but that's what they looked like on the big screen.  Which is how it should be.

If they re-released them again tomorrow with all new digital transferring, I would feel no urge to buy them at all.  I have them the way I want them right now.",1243296000,4,1336,4.481327800829876

There are plenty of extras, I'm sure not every one in existence, but plenty. The picture is so great, like many Blu-rays, you can see the glitches where they super-imposed the Enterprise on the space background.

3785178,4,B001S3GDT0,"I didn't buy this set when it came out because of all the negative reviews posted here, but my friend bought it so I borrowed the set from him and watched all the films and the added bonus material that was made for this Blu-Ray release. After actually watching the films in the set, I believe all the negative reviews are misguided. These versions of the movies surprisingly surpassed my expectations, but there are still a few shortcomings to the set. Here is an overview of my thoughts:

Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Probably the weakest film of the set. Only the theatrical cut is included when there are two other versions I've seen: The remastered Director's Edition and the film with twelve minutes of scenes shot for television in it. I happen to prefer the film with the televised scenes incorporated in, myself. It's the version I grew up on. It's obvious that Paramount rushed this set out to conincide with the new Trek film in theaters rather than giving this film a thorough Blu-Ray treatment. The ideal release would include all the possible versions to choose from. Also, this film has a few grainy scenes that could've been cleaned up more, although this is probably more of a problem with the way the film was originally shot. For the most part, though, the film has been cleaned up considerably and this is the clearest I've ever seen it.

Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan: The set proclaims that this is the only film to receive a true, thorough remastering while the others seemed to have been simply upgraded to Blu-Ray and released without the thorough remaster. Truthfully, I didn't notice any difference between this film and others in the set. ST II looked excellent but so did most of the other films. We only get the theatrical version of this film as well but that's an improvement. The Director's Cut used those damned alternate takes that ruined the movie for me. Good to have the theatrical version back in print.

Star Trek III - The Search For Spock: This is probably the best-looking film of the set visually. I didn't notice a single blemish on the screen while watching this one.

Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home: Another superior release in terms of video and audio quality. A huge improvement over the standard definition DVD version.

Star Trek V - The Final Frontier: Video quality was pretty good. The sound on this one was amazing. A great Blu-Ray to watch with a surround sound system.

Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country: This is the theatrical cut of the film, which excludes the character of Colonel West. Also excluded is the scene where, after Scotty shoots the Klingon assassin out the window, it is revealed that he is actually Colonel West wearing a Klingon mask. My friend saw this in theaters and swears up and down that this scene was in the theatrical version but I'm not sure. Either way, the film doesn't suffer without these scenes. It looks and sounds amazing and it's back in its original aspect ratio.

Bonus Features: There are some nifty new features included with this set. The bonus disc includes a round-table conversation with Shatner, Nimoy, Stewart, Frakes and Whoopi Goldberg. It was pretty entertaining but I don't think it's something to watch more than once or twice. The best bonus feature with this set is on Star Trek II where there is an interview with James Horner on how he came up with the now-classic score for the film. On Star Trek VI is a feature about a theatrical production of the Klingon Hamlet by Shakespeare that is pretty interesting.

The Packaging: It's nice to have these packaged in the standard way most multi-disc boxed sets are coming out these days. The way Paramount released most of the DVD boxed sets for the TV seasons was appalling; they were stuck in cheap plastic trays that were held together by packing tape and it was damned difficult to get the discs out of the holders without snapping the discs in half. I was forced to store them in a CD wallet instead to avoid damage to the discs or packaging. With this set, they're packaged more efficiently and conveniently. The covers of the individual movies each have a picture of a different crew member. This is okay, I guess, but I would've rather had each film's poster like the previous releases had. Also, the discs have a bland gray label on them with lettering identifying what movie you're watching instead of having a nice decorative photo on the label like some of the DVD releases had. This is a sign of how cheap Paramount can be at times.

Overall, this is an above-average set but could've been better. Paramount should've taken their time and put all the different types of releases on each Blu-Ray disc rather than only one version. You know they're going to re-release them again in different versions later. I also wish they would put each of these out individually instead of making them only available in one set. If this were the case, I'd wait on buying The Motion Picture until they come out with the definitive version, but I'd love to own II-VI right away. The set is worthwhile for now, however, and it's nice to see them at a decently low price this time around. Hell, the TV seasons on DVD are still around $50 most places and this is only $75-$90 for six films on Blu-Ray. The set is a good value. Also, the films looked pretty nice on Blu-Ray considering their age. I was pleasently surprised by this.",1243123200,5,5394,4.622129436325679
3785189,5,B001S3GDT0,"To echo some others' thoughts here....great set, great value at Amazon's price.  I've never seen these films look so good on home video.  The Star Trek summit disc is a wonderful extra feature.

The best news of all: we can finally see STAR TREK VI as it was seen in theaters, at the aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  Previous video incarnations of this film were presented at around 1.85:1, including the SD DVD edition.  Unlike the other films in the series, this title was shot in Super 35, which was basically a full-frame format.  Prints could then be generated at any aspect ratio by cropping portions of the full frame.  This provided a high fidelity image, shot with spherical lenses that allowed a greater depth of focus than with anamorphic (Panavision) lenses.  In the old days, it was a great way to ensure that the film would also be compatable with home video's preferred 1.33:1 ratio.  Most filmmakers shot with the ""scope"" aspect ratio of 2.35:1 in mind for their final product.  STAR TREK VI was shown in theaters at 2.35:1 and was meant to be seen at that aspect ratio.

There is very much debatable on its true HD picture for films except Star Trek II.  Since I am but a few of fans of the first film, it was a joy to finally see a much cleaner version of it.  To me the theatrical version is far superior and flows better than the directors cut.  Another good thing is the first film does follow ""To seek out new life forms and new civilizations"" much more than the films to follow than being all out phasers/photon torpedo shootout with familiar Star Trek villains.  It was to follow similar deep sci-fi films like 2001 and Solaris to name a few.  In all a great purchase.  Possibly Paramount can do better.",1243036800,3,742,4.372262773722627

3785193,3,B001S3GDT0,"Having just gone through my set of the Blu-Rays, I'm very happily surprised at the content. The only aspect keeping this from being a 4 or 5 star review is the fact that only the theatrical versions are available.  Blu-Ray is specifically made to hold a great deal more data than any prior video or DVD format. Aside from the issues regarding the new effects of the director's cut of TMP, there's little reason (other than monetary) for Paramount to hold back the extended cuts. Seamless branching, used so successfully on the TOS first season set, would work equally well here.

The Motion Picture is another story, since the new effects were rendered for lower resolution and it will take time and, of course, money to rerender them. We can expect to see a Director's Edition release on BD in the near future, I'm sure. However, this does not excuse the lack of the inclusion of the extended TV cut put out on video.

Having said that, it is an amazing thrill having the theatrical cuts of The Motion Picture, and The Undiscovered Country on disc for the first time ever. TUC was NEVER seen in this version since its original release and until today, I had totally forgotten how good a film it was. Many fans enjoy the additional scenes, but I always felt they brought the film down some. The scenes were obvious and amped up the silliness fact in a film that very much needed to be played straight. The two video versions really brought the maturity level of the story down some notches.

Now, however, we once again see the film as originally released 18 years ago (oh God, it's been that long). Over the years, the film had become less enjoyable and fallen down the ranks in my personal list of favorites. None of the other had, but this one - a film I really loved in the theater - had dropped in favor. Now, having watched it again from beginning to end, I found I loved the film once more. The story is tighter and less obvious. These changes were not major, but they made an impact. This is the best movie for the cast to exit on and is once more a 4 star film to me.

The Motion Picture: it's great to see this movie in this format again, as released without alteration. However, this film is more problematic. The extended version was just a ""longer cut"" with some great scenes added, but none of the fat trimmed (these scenes are included in the extras). The Directors Cut was better paced and more tightly edited and also added some amazing effects to cover some of the less successful work in the picture, but they also lost bits that made the film unique which weren't ""bad."" Since there never actually was a ""perfect"" version of this film, it's vital all three versions should be made available (or maybe someone should redo the DE).

The Wrath of Kahn: again the theatrical cut and, as we all know, this film had the full restoration, presumably because the master elements needed it badly while the other films were fine. I'll comment on picture shortly, but let's just say this is a fantastic presentation of the movie.

Finally The Search for Spock, my favorite Trek film. For those who notice such things, the video versions always screwed up the opening credits. The VHS version had them replaced by ""video graphics"" which looked like a cheap, high school AV squad attempt to make Star Trek movie credits. The wide screen VHS and laserdiscs were much better, givings us the titles seen in the film. However, the DVDs had a ""glitched"" version of the titles, with the timing off badly. It's tough to explain, but if you compare the BD and the DVD opening credits, you'll see them. And since this is my all time favorite Trek film, one I saw in the theater 7 times and memorized with obsessive Trekkie abandon, you can imagine my thrill when I saw the BD version corrected the credits. Ahhhh! :-)

Okay, my impression of the picture quality. There's been a lot said about the excessive digital noise reduction Paramount slathered on the films. I was expecting some bad stuff when I fired up my 52 inch HDTV. You know what I got? An amazing picture - every time. The level of sharpness and clarity to these films is a revelation! I had NEVER seen these films looking so amazingly sharp and detailed. The Wrath of Kahn, which - as noted - got the real restoration, is very nice, but I didn't notice a huge difference between this restoration and the other films. Mostly, I noticed the print was a little darker than prior prints and the other films. The blacks do hold up well on BD, better than on HD-DVD, to my surprise.

I have read that those who watch the movies on HUGE screens will notice the DNR, I have to say that my 52 inch, which I sit 6 to 8 feet away from, does not reveal any obvious dullness. And, really, I would assume the great majority of people don't go much larger than 52 inch (unless you have a mansion and more money than God). Honestly, I have no issues with the picture quality, and can wholeheartedly give the picture a thumbs up.

The sound is also extremely impressive. The dialog is not lost among the music and sound effects, like so many other HD presentations. The muddiness in much of Kahn and The Search for Spock is not as strong, and the music score for the films never sounded so good.

The subtitles for various alien languages are, however, disc generated, not embedded in the films. So the ""species centric"" fonts are lost (and, I guess, really doesn't make these true theatrical cuts). However, they are not obviously bad or ""video titles"" and won't stand out to people not that familiar or who don't care.

To sum up: the only disappointment is in the fact that there's plenty of room for all versions of the films, either side by side or through branching, so (aside from the DE of TMP), there's no reason to have left them out. Having all versions would justify the price tag of this double or triple dip. Especially since you know Paramount will release these again with these versions included.

Otherwise, it's a great set. The theatrical cuts are the versions I fell in love with and it's great to have them back. The picture is outstanding, with refreshing sharpness and clarity, while the sound mix is comfortable and satisfying.

5 stars for the presentation
Subtract 2 stars for leaving out the alternate versions.

For fans of the original cuts, this is an essential set. It's up to you to decide if you want to hold out for the next and probably more complete release of these films.",1243036800,201,6456,4.520137103684662
3785194,3,B001S3GDT0,"Wonderful movies first off. Now that I have watched them all, my one gripe is that much of the restoration in many scenes is centered on the character in focus and sometimes a small area around them, but the remaining area is even worse than a standard dvd. For example you look at the face of Kirk when Spock comes aboard and first appears on the bridge in the first movie and it is clear as is a section to the right of some guy standing in the back, but the rest of the frame is totally blurred, so bad in fact that it is distracting. Otherwise, the restored areas are fantastic and the movies speak for themeselves.",1242864000,,619,4.254237288135593
3785195,4,B001S3GDT0,I have only sampled the movies. The transfer looks fine. I wasn't going to post the review but decided to post one so that it will balance out the 1 star vote from people that did not review the product.,1242864000,2,203,4.1
3785196,4,B001S3GDT0,"This first part of this review is going to highlight one aspect mainly and that is the extra disc included called, ""The Summit"". Epic. It is pure gold. Not only as a fan of Trek, but of those actors and the lifestyle of their world.

With ""The Summit"" we not only get a VERY candid and HONEST Q/A session of Frakes, Shatner, Nimoy and Stewert, we get a glimpse in to their day to day thoughts as actors talking to other actors and as people talking to other people. It's brilliant.

Sections of the round table are down right histerical and some are wholy uncomfortable, but it is a look behind the curtain any fan of the actors presented would kill to see.

Now for the actual films...

Transfers are very well done. The TrueHD sound is impactful. On the earlier films there is sadly some clipping of the levels, but that might have actually been in the original audio masters. The picture is pristine, and transfered with the right gamma corrections. 2:35:1 aspect is soley where Trek should live and it looks huge on a bigscreen.

Note that these are the original theater releases of the films. You will not find the redone ""Motion Picture"" with new VFX in this collection. The rest of the films do not have the extra scenes added from the special editions. Frankly, I'm fine with that. The extras each film had added to it was really best left for the cutting room floor. The movies stand on their own as they were originally released.

But be prepared for a double-dip. I am sure they will release the special editions later. Although the ""Motion Picture"" might be an issue. As the enhanced visual effects that were done for it were not generated at film resolution, but only at television resolution. Paramount did not want to pay for it back when this was done and those digital files from which those enhanced visual effects came from are long gone, as is sadly the Director.

And as for Kahn being the only one to be truely HD in its transfer...well...it does look awesome. Does it look more awesome than the others? On my 32"" 1080p Samsung, not really. On my 110"" LCD projection...yes the other films are softer. But the other films starting with TrekIV used newer film stocks, lighting techniques and lenses and look better to begin with. So they don't suffer as much in a direct comparison to TrekII. Back to back TrekII and TrekIII...again on the 110"" projection...you can see a difference. But it's far from terrible.

LET ME STRESS THE OTHER FILMS LOOK GREAT. They are a tad softer than TrekII but they are in no means ""upscaled"" DVD as some have said in other reviews. That is simply not true. They were transferred in HD but they did not get the full-on film negative rescan like TrekII; is all. They ""look"" very HD, very clear and you can see all the tiny details.

As for the scary comments that the movies look out of focus...heh...folks it's called Panavision lenses. The cinemascope anamorphic lenses they use back in the 70s through late 80s all suffered from very shallow depth-of-field. Look at all those classic films from that era! Alien, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard. All those films have vignette (edge of framing) out of focus and soft. It's just a technical aspect to that style of filming.",1242864000,11,3216,4.588850174216028
3785197,5,B001S3GDT0,"I will admit right out of the blocks that I am a 'newbie' to HD. I waited until the BD / HDDVD war was over and this is my first purchase of BD disks. That said, I read with a LOT of concern reviews posted here by many people who posted reviews prior to release of these; it is odd that reviews are allowed prior to any chance of the reviewer having possession of the item.

Anyway, I received the set a couple days ago and thus far have watched large parts of I, II, and IV. I have to say that I find the quality excellent. I was worried about the DNR issue but for me it is not very noticeable; I have carefully watched for loss of information / facial expression and when I have seen that effect it is apparent it is not from DNR but from soft focus either intentional or accidental in the filmmaking process (one can tell that the focal plane for the original film is not set for sharp facial focus but is focused on nearby objects or another face with lighting and camera setup not giving adequate depth-of-field for sharp focus for both). The visual detail is really stunning. It really took me back to seeing TWOK in the theater years ago with a level of detail that was only barely hinted at on my old VHS copy; better hinted at on LaserDisc, quite viewable on DVD, and now is back. (Yes, Paramount has done well by me)

I respect the opinions of those who honestly AFTER VIEWING THE MOVIES feel there are issues; but please don't avoid the purchase and enjoyment of this great set (at a great price) just because some folks who have never seen them are critical.

A HUGE step up from the dvd set that I also own. The motion picture has never looked so good. This is the oldest of the films and I am very impressed with how good it looks. They all look great.

As far as too much DNR and people looking waxy. Well, they have a ton of make up caked on there faces. These are not the youngest of actors in these movies. People need to know the differance. I still see facial detail, clothing, etc.

Also, people commented on things being out of focus, not sharp. I think the cameras used have a very short focus length. So if someone is not the focus of a scene, they are not in focus. This has nothing to do with the restoration, it was how it was filmed originally.

Over all I am VERY happy with this set and it is a GREAT deal! Well worth the money.",1242777600,5,934,4.010752688172043

I was afraid I would pop this Blu-Ray into my player and be totally disappointed by a lackluster presentation. I've seen the screenshots and I started to worry that I wasted $80. I was wrong.

Before I continue, know I haven't evaluated all six movies in the set. I started with the oldest - Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It was an experience. I said ""Wow"" to my television. I've seen this movie countless times on VHS & DVD - I know this movie and I was immediately impressed by what I was able to see. The V'Ger cloud now has levels of detail that give the image depth - something I'm sure I would have noticed had I been lucky enough to see this one in 35mm on the big screen. Can't say the same for my DVD. I felt like I was watching this flick for the first time.

I can't wait to make it through the rest of the set - with Part II being the crown jewel. If you're on the fence trying to decide whether or not to get this set because you've read it looks horrible - RELAX. It's WAY better than DVD. Will they release special editions later?

3785215,4,B001S3GDT0,"Here we go with the Star Trek 1-6 Motion Picture Collection. (Theatrical Cuts)

Quite frankly, these are the best the movies have ever looked.

Wrath of Kahn has been digitally restored, where they scan the negative frame-by frame and clean it up. The old DVD of this movie was hideous. Brutal grain and damaged film throughout. The clean up on it for the blu-ray is amazing, however there are a few scenes, most notably the botany bay scene which look real soft, perhaps shot that way in the first place, or the original negative was damaged. Great job here despite the rough shooting problems.

Now 1,3-6 have been cleaned up greatly as well, and yes there is a massive amount of grain removal. For darker scenes, like on the planet in ST III this looks completely fine. Also the space scenes look exemplary. I did notice some softening on medium and close up shots of the actors, mainly when Kirk is talking to the other admiral in ST III, just check his collar and you'll understand. However I found this ""noise removal"" to be noticeable in only a few scenes per movie and very minor.

I am viewing the Blu-rays on a BenQ w500 projector on a 110' screen using a PS3, and can say the the whole DNR whoolabaloo is quite overblown.

There is about 2 1/2 hrs of new HD content and new commenataries for every film. For about 11 bucks a disc the set is a very good value.",1242604800,8,1370,4.420634920634921
3785216,5,B001S3GDT0,"I was not a fan of the special editions of any of these movies with the exception of Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  When TMP first hit video, someone decided to slap together an extended cut which inserted an extra 12 minutes of extremely boring a pointless material that was originally dropped for very good reasons.  The director's cut, with a few notable exceptions, took most of this footage back out and got us much closer to the theatrical version.

The director's cut of Wrath of Khan similarly incorporated unnecessary footage that I felt did not add anything to the story.

And then there was the notorious ""Scooby-Doo"" ending tacked onto the home video version of Star Trek VI.

People have said that Paramount is going to double-dip us with the Blu-Ray release and they're probably right.  A year or two from now we will most likely see the special editions of the original six films on blu and this release will fade away.

3785217,4,B001S3GDT0,"I had pre-ordered this item, and then saw some early reviews around the web stating that the video quality wasn't up to snuff. I canceled my order, and put the discs on my Netflix queue instead to evaluate them before purchase.

Well, I re-ordered the set. Let me tell you why.

The Films:

The Trek films, to my mind, are a very good capstone to the Original Series Trek characters' stories. In them, we are presented with a very good ""trilogy"" of sorts, ST2-4, and a few other films that retain the thematic elements of the others whilst enjoying varying quality of story.

The Motion Picture (ST1) is unfairly maligned in my eyes. It very ably presents a story of characters re-uniting after a hiatus, with all the varying emotional consequences of that separation. Grafted to this is a relatively high-concept science fiction tale of an artificial intelligence seeking its creator. If this film had been cut by 20 minutes (very long effects sequences which seem a deliberate paean to Kubrick's ""2001""), people would be hailing it as a masterpiece.

ST2: The Wrath of Khan is, of course, the public's pick as the greatest Trek film. It's hard to argue. A good villain, a deep emotional core, a slam-bang space battle, and some great performances make this a film that doesn't really misfire.

ST3: The Search For Spock is the middle act of a ""trilogy"", and really works in my opinion. It has a lot of action, a good dose of humor, and a lot of heart.

ST4: The Voyage Home is unbridled fun from start to finish. Lighter in tone than the preceding two films, it still captures the emotional core of the story, and brings the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion.

ST5: The Final Frontier is the black sheep of the family. It introduces an unfortunate ""retcon"" character, does some unrealistic things in its quest to reach the ""center of the galaxy,"" and posits an unsatisfying sci-fi story about ""finding god."" The characterizations are still generally good, though, and there are plenty of charming moments for fans.

ST6: The Undiscovered Country is a return to form of sorts, but I think would not be regarded as highly if it had not followed ST5. A cold-war allegory, it has some good action, but suffers from some silly sequences in the middle (a prison planet and a murder mystery spring to mind). It does have Captain Sulu, though, which is hard to dislike.

The Blu-Ray:

Well, first I'll list the negatives:

We are not presented with the ""directors editions"" from the last DVD box set. Thus we miss some new effects shots from ST1, one very good bit of back story from ST2, and a few negligible cuts from the rest of the films (mainly 6).

Digital Noise Reduction has been applied to at least the final 4 films - and the results are not always positive. Grain has been reduced from the films with negative results - some very fine detail (such as fine facial wrinkles) is scrubbed away also. It probably will not be noticeable on displays under 40 inches - and I imagine it would be quite noticeable on front projection screens above 80 inches. I personally noticed it in spots on my 50"" display, especially on Star Trek 4. ST4 comes off by far the worst, with many faces looking waxy - and other scenes being artificially pumped up by edge enhancement to compensate (check out Kirk and Spock walking by the boat dock before Gillian picks them up). I would say ST4 and ST6 suffer the most by the out of control noise reduction. You can really see it when smoke is in a scene - check out the scene in ST6 when Kirk smokes a cigar. As the smoke wafts in front of his face, you can see pores and lines under the eyes that are absent in the very next shot sans smoke. It's that extra little layer of detail we could have had, and it's missing.

The double dip conundrum: we are certain to be presented with a new set, although I will go on record betting it won't be before Xmas 2010, if even that soon. Paramount will be putting out the Abrams film this year, Seasons 2-3 of TOS this year, and the TNG movies probably next year. Surely there will be a complete box set at some point, incorporating the ""directors edition"" footage, but I would guess that this will not be released until the 2nd Abrams film hits theaters. It seems to takes upwards of a year to re-transfer and restore a film, the Directors footage has to be re-shot in 1080p, and logically, Paramount would not cannibalize their current retail SKUs by so quickly re-releasing them. So I would guess 2012 would be the soonest we'd see the ""directors editions"" with new, hopefully less DNR'ed transfers.

All right, now the good news:

These films have never looked this good. NEVER. ST1 is revelatory - there are colors I've never seen, and DNR is not obtrusive at all - fine detail seems quite evident. ST2, which apparently had the latest transfer, does not suffer from excessive DNR. ST3-6 are the films that have the most aggressive noise reduction, but it is only noticeable in select scenes (I am watching on a 50"" 1080p display). For the most part, detail is quite strong (especially for movies shot in the 1980s), color depth blows away the DVDs (you really should compare them - prepare to be dazzled), and sound quality is excellent. The worst looking of these films look as good as the best cable TV HD. The best of them (1 and 2) are competitive with some of the better Blu-Rays on the market now. Just to correct some misinformation from previous reviews, all the films are presented in 1080p. None of them are 1080i, or anything less. Also, all of the films are truly high definition. They are not some sort of pseudo-HD, as one particularly egregious review has claimed.

So it's hit or miss in terms of A/V, but light years ahead of the DVDs. The biggest gains are in color - the DVDs are positively muddy by comparison. ST 1, 2, and 5 generally look pretty good detail-wise. The other films suffer from waxy faces - they have strong mid-range detail (like cloth textures or scenery), but weak fine detail (like facial wrinkles). It is aggravating, because the films look so good in general, that the little details are washed away.

Extras are VERY strong. Each film gets new commentaries, and most retain a second commentary as well. MANY new documentaries supplement the older ones which are retained for this set (I would estimate about 100 minutes per film combining old and new content). ""Library Computer"" offers interactive text data while you watch the films. BD Live functions include the ability to create and take fan quizzes with your remote and internet connection. The one giant new inclusion, ""The Captains Summit,"" is presented on its own disc in full HD quality. This is a 70 minute round table, hosted by Whoopie (Guinan) Goldberg, featuring actors William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart(Picard) and Jonathan Frakes (Riker). Wow! It is oddly titled, and I wish that they had included Kate Mulgrew (Janeway), Scott Bakula (Archer), and Avery Brooks (Sisko). The interview was a bit directionless at times, with Goldberg failing to keep her guests on track. Nonetheless, the actors are generally funny and at times engaging and insightful, and true fans will eat this up.

Atypically for CBS/Paramount, the packaging for this set is very nice. A cardboard box with a plastic slipcover holds the Blu-Ray cases, which are all of the ""slim"" variety. Thus, the set takes up the space of only about 3 regular Blu-Ray cases, despite having seven discs. Separate cases, though, allow you to lend out one disc, and there is never any fumbling around with the elaborate multi-disc cases that often comprise these sets.

******

In summary, it comes down to a value proposition. At Amazon's reduced price, you're getting the theatrical cuts of the films, better than they've ever looked, for $11.65 apiece. I know I've paid more for films I care about a lot less. There probably won't be superior presentations of them for at least 3 years. So for a serious Trekkie, the math is simple. This is a purchase.

For a general sci-fi fan with an HD setup, it's a maybe. If you're the type who's willing to buy ""Chronicles of Riddick"" for $20 just to have something HD to watch with spaceships and explosions, it's hard to see the argument against this set. If you're a new Trek fan who wants to dive in, this value is hard to beat. If you don't care much about Trek, this might be a pass, since intimate knowledge and interest for the characters really helps your enjoyment of the films.

The haters need to calm down. No, this is not a perfect set. But at this price, it is still a very strong value. The missing material is not really integral to enjoying the films (unlike the LOTR set without the Extended Edition material - now THAT is a significant loss). If you want to see the films for the next 3 or 4 years at their best, this is the set to get. Otherwise, you're stuck with the dull, muddy DVD transfers for at least that long. When it comes time for the double-dip in 2012, the only ones that will probably warrant a re-purchase are 1 and 2, since they gained the most from the ""Directors Edition"" material.

I would have rated this 3 stars had it been significantly more expensive, or had significantly fewer extras. But for $11-$13 (depending on the set's price) per movie, I'm willing to take the plunge, come what may. I think this set is a worthwhile purchase at either price point, and I would have placed the order at 79.99 as well.",1242518400,49,9450,4.614651578320429
3785218,5,B001S3GDT0,I certainly agree with the lastest reviews on this page; the set is better than I expected given the harshness of the first wave of reviewers and the nitpicking from the videophiles.

All I can say is, try the set out, its not as bad as most people claim. And most of those people have yet to even see the set on their own TV, much less anyone else's. I've learned in the past to ignore reviews from people that are reviewing a product before it has been released.

3785230,4,B001S3GDT0,"I pre-ordered this set well in advance and started to get very worried about the quality issues reading some of the ""pre-release"" reviews.  I was very relieved when I finally got the set and was able to my own evaluation.  I don't exactly know where a lot of the 1 star reviewers are coming from.  The majority of reviews make this set sound like the video quality is on par with an old VHS or laserdisc release, which is completely not the case.  Let me start out with one thing.  You already LOVE Star Trek if you are buying this set and not the ""Trilogy"" set with Star Trek II, III, and IV which I would recommend to casual Star Trek fans since you get the better movies anyways (with maybe the exception of ST VI).  Just wait and get ST VI as a director's cut.
As pointed out by several other reviewers the stand out movie is Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn.  The digital restoration is beautiful!  Waiting for this set I watched my old DVD copy last week and then the new Blu-ray version when I received it and WOW!!! It looks amazing.  I've never seen this movie look so good or sound so good!
As with the other movies, while they do not look like TWOK, they still look amazing!  The picture quality is very good, excellent contrast on everything but STIII.  But I seem to remember even in the theater this movie looked soft.  STIV has a little more noticable DRC, I think due to the stock used on the film.  I've always thought was a little more grainy due to the fact that the film was shot with a lot of exterior locations using a daylight stock.  I think they did wash some of the grain out with the DRC.  But the quality is still much, much, much better the the DVD release!

1.  The trilogy pack (II, III, and IV) costs LESS THAN HALF of this set.  So this set is overpriced.
2.  Original theatrical prints, really?  So TMP (1979) is its full uncut w/original effects snoozefest?  Is Trek VI both in 2.35:1 ratio and had a lot of chopped footage restored (I saw it three times in two weeks in 1991 and remember a lot of McCoy scenes being removed for the video release)
3.  Why not include the TNG movies as well?  Because the shallow revamp of the Kirk cast has hit the screens and nobody wants to see Picard for the moment? (Kirk in TOS may have been cocky, but he used his wit and wasn't just a vain twit.  Amongst a list of nitpicks so long, even the crass ""Nemesis"" can be forgiven...)
4.  1080i may be pawned off as ""high def"", but most people with 1080p sets and who bought into blu-ray are rightfully expecting 1080p definition.
5.  I'll go along with others' comments about excessive DNR.  Their descriptions have a ring of truth to them (I've used DNR when doing VHS->DVD transfers), and too many people are saying the same things to simply ignore.
6.  Can I mention that the trilogy movie set (II, III, and IV) costs only 25~33% of the 6-movie set?  I already did?  Well, it's such a good reason I felt I had to say it twice.  A literal quadruple-dip.

I will wait for a definitive Blu-ray set and after all 3 tv series are re-released, with the original f/x.  (the special edition f/x, while having better camera angles, have cheap CGI that looks more cartoony than anything.)",1242259200,4,1552,4.404929577464789
3785236,4,B001S3GDT0,"I'm floored by the number of reviews here that give this a 1 star review, and then state that they haven't seen the movies.  If you actually compare the picture quality with these new BDs to previous DVDs, you do see a vast improvement.  Star Trek II, III, and IV have more consistant color and detail then what I saw in the DVDs.  In previous editions of ST III, I always noticed an upped contrast in comparison to II and IV: but in this set, it's in line with all the other movies.  There seems to be a lot of rumors here about what ""Digitally Restored"" is over ""Digitally Remastered"" (as TWOK was the only to get ""Digitally Restored"").  A digital restoration is when it's accessed that there has to be a new edit of the film due to the state of the print (it could be going in and adjusting color levels for consistancy or even digitally painting out blemishes).  It seems Paramount found TWOK to be the only movie in need of a restoration: when you see the other movies on a HDTV, you can easily tell that they are coming from an HD master and not an SD upconversion like some are claiming.  They compare favorably to other blu-ray movies from all the big studios.  I notice some of the HD interviews are the same interviews taken from the special edition DVDs: it's nice to see them in their original HD resolution (where the studio has obviously been gearing up for HD for several years).  Note that there's also some interviews from the special edition DVDs that were shot in SD and have been transfered to this issue (the main one seemed to be ST V).  The only gimmick I find with the movies is the ""new"" 7.1 sound mixes.  I don't see the need in mixing 5.1 to 7.1....but the lossless audio does sound great.  This blu-ray set is a definite improvement over any other issues of the movies.  Issues like DNR or restorations are always subjective; but these transfers are good enough that whenever the movies get a re-issue, I suspect it will be more along the lines of adding more featurettes (or rendering out HD resolutions of the CG shots in the case of TMP).

***Addition****

Since there are still more 1 star reviews, I thought I should address the misinformation about what remastering means in relation to Blu-Ray.  It's impossible for any of these movies to have come from a DV (digital video: SD DVD resolution) because studios have been working in 2k resolutions for awhile.  A 2k file is 2048 pixels wide by X number high (it's a standard that has varying aspects....with some of my 3D files, I work in 2048x2048).  Studios are currently converting to 4k work for new movies and for film restorations of older titles.  So the restoration for TWOK might have been scanned at 4k for the 35mm scenes and 8k for the 70mm VFX.  The other movies could have been scanned a number of years ago, but the studio would still have masters that are at least 2k resolutions.

  Now studios do not author BDs themselves: they go hire companies to do that.  So for a genuine HDTV movie, Blu-Ray title, or DVD title the company is getting a copy of the 2k studio master and then remastering for that particular medium: for Blu-Ray, they rescale and process the image to be 1920x1080 at 24 fps....for HDTV, they rescale to 1920x1080 60I, and for DVD, they rescale to 720x480.  At this stage, the authoring company then adds particular DNR and compression appropriate for for the medium.  When it comes to DNR, some people are more against it then others.  I personally don't feel the DNR is that bad here: there are some scenes in these movies that weren't processed the way I'd like them to....but if they ever do get a remaster, it's going to be at the HD level: the studio master is unadulterated.

To conclude my thoughts....it's a pity that the reviews here are getting dragged down by mis-information.  I gave this set a 4 star review simply because I save 5 stars for the extremely good titles on BD.  If you have a 100"" TV, then maybe you want to wait for another HD remaster with less DNR.  I'm not as anti-DNR as others....but I'd say that it's not as bad as some make it out to be: I still see plenty of grain for appropriate scenes, and there's not huge edge enhancement going on during scenes with too much softfocus.  And for me, the softfocus issues (only in certain scenes) and certain cinematography effects are a lot more glaring then DNR: things that were harder to pick up back when these movies were made, and something that's niether correctable in a transfer and is more clearly evident in HD.  For a 110"" TV DNR issues might be more overwhelming, but for my more modest TV set with great 7.1 sound system, I'd say this is a no brainer purchase for any passing fan of the series.  The movies are marred by some production values that prevent this set from being a ""demo"" set, but I think the transfers do more closely reflect the studio masters.  All of the movies have never looked or sounded as good: they should be stunning for any passing fan of Star Trek.",1242259200,"1,569",4984,4.469613259668508
3785237,1,B001S3GDT0,I'm rating this one start because I hate when studios don't spend the time and money for a proper release. Star Trek is one of those franchises that has been especially abused on DVD. Releasing a blu-ray set with only one one of the films actually in high definition is disgraceful. Give the fans some respect and put the time and effort into quality products!!,1242259200,3,361,4.569230769230769
3785238,5,B001S3GDT0,"One of the most satisfying BD sets I've gotten. And I gottem all. It looks and sounds fantastic. I don't even mind the bird droppings on one shot, that could have used some clearasil; and that's the kind of stuff that the hard core Trekkers have aneurysms about. For me, the set was very satisfying including the box. Restored Khan or DNR'd; all episodes reached the same goal. A great upgrade from DVD and a chance to enjoy the original cuts, which were good enough. I never did get a big charge from the Directors Cut of TMP other than an occasional, 'look at that'. The first one is fresh as always.
There is a great dissent about this set because it has not been 'restored to the max' and there are moments that could use it  BUT... It would be a great mistake to avoid this set in favor of a future upgrade. There will be one; but not as soon as many  think. There was much work done to make all these films look as good as possible for now! And they look and sound 'state of the art' within limitations. Better that most films from this period or later.

3785239,4,B001S3GDT0,"I couldn't wait, so sorry. Unmentioned local retailer was willing to match price.. Whooohooo!  Anyway I will buy from Amazon when I can.

So my theory is this is going to be the only time we will ever be able to buy The Motion Picture in Theatrical Release. It has never been released on DVD and I expect they won't give it any more time or energy. ;-) So far I am watching TMP and noticed CODEC anomalies ""glitches"" every so often. I thought it was my HTPC, so I backed it up, and they occurred in the same spot in the timeline. So I don't know what this is. Please confirm if you see blocks or flashes at specific points. Voice audio is up and down.. Not a good idea at 1 AM. There are occasional spots or dirt... Just says film to me, crystal clear dirt :-)

Definitely HD my friends. The SD content is the ""extras"" or interviews. No need to worry about that. Extensive archive here. If you know nothing about Star Trek now, you will become an expert after watching the whole thing.... Take plenty of caffeine tablets to get through that.

Since I am currently watching TMP while I write this, I will comment on what I see. It's been so long since I have seen the TMP Director's Cut, I completely forgot how much development from this film went towards Then Next Generation. The Engine Room, Hallways, The Music. If you see other correlation's pipe in.

In the end I am looking forward to the rest of the collection, any blu-ray TNG releases, and the Directors Cut, remasters. I hope the codec anomalies is just my system and not the disc.",1242259200,7,1542,4.340277777777778

I am a huge Trekkie (yes, I prefer that term to Trekker) so getting these six films plus a disc featuring a 70 minute roundtable with Shatner, Nimoy, Stewart and Frakes for a mere $80.00.............on Blu ray!.....was a no brainer.

I have sampled all discs and the picture and sound quality are fantastic.  I have no complaints.  In fact, my expectations were surpassed.  Sure, 'Wrath of Khan' was the only film to receive a full restoration.  Not to knock the other films too hard but it's probably the only one that really deserved it.  Are the other films lacking for not receiving the same treatment?  No, not really.

Am I upset about the lack of ""Director's"" or ""Extended"" cuts?  Not at all.  'The Motion Picture' is too long for it's own good anyways and I find the theatrical version has much better pacing.  I grew up watching 'The Wrath of Khan' on VHS so when the 2 disc DVD came out in 2002, that version just didn't seem quite right.  It's not what I had been used to watching for 15 or so years.  The minimal extra footage from 'The Undiscovered Country' can't really be missed either.

For clarity:

1-) All the movies are presented in 1080p high definition.

2-) The bonus features that have been carried over from the 2 disc DVD releases are presented in standard definition.  These features comprise the ""12 Hours Of Previously Released Material"" that is mentioned on the packaging.

3785243,5,B001S3GDT0,"After reading some of the negative reviews i seriously considered not buying this box set. I am an avid Star Trek fan and ended up deciding to buy it. The deciding factor was that I wanted to help promote the franchise.

  Most of the negative reviews were written by people who have not seen this product. When I put the first movie in and saw the picture and heard the audio I was amazed at how awsome it is. You have never seen star trek like this before. If you are a Star Trek fan you owe it to yourself to get these movies! This box set is a tremendous upgrade from the old DVD's. the quality is so much better that it is almost like watching these movies for the first time! Can you tell I that I am excited?

  I don't think that anyone who has actually seen this blu-ray set could give it less than 4 stars. If you are considering buying this box set you should disregaurd all ratings that were posted before the release date. The negative reviews show a great deal of hostility towards paramount which is not productive, nor is it a true indicator of the quality of this great product. If you only look at the reviews that were posted after this set was released you would have a solid 4+ star rating.

It is true that it could be better. As with all things there is always room for improvement. Maybe they could probably improve the video quality a little bit on I,III,IV,V, and VI if they had completely remastered them, which they probably will in the future. They could have also added the directors cuts, which they probably will in the future. They could have released all 10 or 11 movies together in 1 box set, which they probably will in the future. If anything less than the exact perfect box set configuration makes you angry at the manufacturer then by all means wait untill that day comes. Maybe two or three years from now they will put something out there that meets all of your specifications. If you like the original series movies and you want to enjoy them in a whole new way then buy the six movie set with confidence and have a great time watching them today!

GREAT PRODUCT!!!",1242172800,10,2107,4.343511450381679
3785244,3,B001S3GDT0,"Yes, these are remastered in 1080p and not upconverted from an SD source as many pre-release review trolls would have you believe. There is still some debate as to exactly how they were remastered but from what I can gather TWOK got a needed restoration from the camera negative before remastering while the rest were remastered from prints and processed in video. Feel free to correct me as I'm no expert here.

Yes, DNR was applied somewhat too liberally but not to a degree that makes this anything less than a vast improvement over the DVD versions.

So far I've only watched 1, 2, 3 and 6 on my bedrooms 32"" 1080p LCD sitting approx. 5 feet away using a PS3.

TMP looked very good. The dated sfx are more obvious now than ever due to the improved video quality. There could have been more attention paid to cleaning up dust and dirt in some scenes, especially where the Enterprise first leaves spacedock. One scene in particular looked like a bird crapped on the camera. I also had issues with the audio while listening over my HDTV's built in speakers. Dialog was very quiet while music and sound fx were blasting. I was constantly turning it up and down. This only occurred with TMP and I'm sure will be fine when I give it a listen over my 7.1 HT.

TWOK, as mentioned previously, looked pretty rough toward the beginning but improved as it went along. Those camera negatives must have been seriously neglected.

TSFS looked good throughout as did ""Undiscovered Country"".

BD and PQ issues aside I think this set is good especially for @$80.

I've always liked TMP for it's more intelligent avant garde approach in the vein of 2001 rather than try to directly compete with Star Wars. TWOK is and always will be my favorite. The only one I didn't like and in fact hated is ,of course, ""Final Frontier"". It's painful to watch and I was left feeling really embarrassed for all involved. They could have left that one out and no one would have made issue of it.

If a directors cut with full restorations on all the films, is released I'll probably give this as a gift to someone and get it. I may wait for new release pricing to subside though.

LOTR will be getting the same theatrical edition treatment but since there is no debate that the extended versions are the ones to have I urge everyone to avoid that first dip. You can get away with that with Star Trek but not LOTR.",1242172800,6,2382,4.482678983833718
3785245,4,B001S3GDT0,"I've now watched all six films in this set. Overall, I think the picture quality is very good - sharp and cleaned up - and so much better than the DVD versions of the movies.  I also had owned the first seven ST films on DVD, so I have an idea what those versions look like. The Wrath of Khan was restored in Hi-Def; the other films were remastered in Hi-Def.  Audio mixes of all the films are in 7.1 Dolby TrueHD.

I have not watched the DVD and blu ray versions at the same time; that would require a second DVD/Blu ray player hooked up to my system.  I have re-watched the first 30 minutes of ST TMP on DVD and then immediately watched it on blu ray from this box set. I watch these films on a (self calibrated) Sony 40XBR4 using previous gen HDMI Monster cables and last year's Sony BDP-s350 with firmware version 19. I have a 5.1 audio system (Def Tech 800's) powered by a Yamaha RXV-663. I am not an expert in picture quality/audio evaluations.

ST TMP:  The film looks very good.  I recall maybe 3 scenes where dirt or film blemishes appear in TMP.  The picture colors are brighter and more natural looking compared to what I recall from the DVD. In one scene, when the Enterprise is departing space dock, the film dirt is so obvious that one wonders how that was missed during cleanup. Yes, the film looks much cleaner compared to the DVD version.

In several scenes of ST TMP, I noticed the complexions of facial skin are smooth and somewhat wax-like. The PQ looks much sharper than the DVD version. After my second viewing of select scenes of TMP on blu ray and comparing them to scenes on the DVD version, I don't see a real difference of DNR levels between these versions. Perhaps someone with a large screen (wider than 65"") should compare the two and comment on the level of details.

There are a few scenes in TMP where one part of it is sharp and in focus (e.g. Cmd. Decker, who is standing next to Capt. Kirk) while in that same scene, another part is totally out of focus (e.g. the shoulder or arm of Capt. Kirk who is standing next to Cmd. Decker; or, the background of the Bridge, etc.). In other instances, the right/left sides of the scenes look blurry to me. I listened to the commentary track on TMP and learned that the out-of-focus scenes are the results of bi-focal lenses used on the cameras.

ST II: I agree with The Digital Bits concerning ST II.  The PQ and colors are excellent.  In a very early scene, I noticed some film grain and lesser details, but the rest of the film looks fantastic.

ST III: I have watched ST III and it looks almost as good as Wrath of Khan in many scenes. PQ is clear, sharp; color and contrast are very good indeed. Contrasts in these films look different from that in the DVD versions. I don't know if the contrast levels were ""corrected"" to a reference level for HD.

ST V and VI: There are scenes in ST V and ST VI where I do not see excessive DNR at all; in fact, the details on the faces of the characters are sharp and in focus. I find these two movies entertaining, especially in scenes with the central characters.

ST IV: For some reason, this film didn't look quite as sharp, but perhaps the source material is the reason. Like TMP, ST IV has scenes where the right/left sides of the widescreen look out of focus, caused by the camera lenses used. Overall, I am very satisfied with what I have seen and heard in this remastered HD version of ST IV.

The 7.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track sounds fantastic.  For the first time, the dialogue is clear and at a reasonable volume level. When a spacecraft flies by, you can hear it swoosh by you.  The audio mix makes me believe I'm sitting in the Captain's chair! Audio in these films is the best yet available.

Because of my TV size, DNR effect is not very noticeable and not a show stopper for me.  Even if DNR was NOT applied to these films, wouldn't you agree that images lose details when projected onto (or viewed on) a larger screen compared to a smaller one? What about viewing distance? Have you ever sat at the front and back rows of a theater and notice a decrease of details when viewing the film up close?

Is this box set worth the price? Yes! If you can get a decent discount, that would be even better. At the current price on Amazon, however, you should still consider this set, it's that good. If your viewing screen size is greater than 46"", and you are concerned about excessive DNR, then perhaps you should wait (or rent whenever that becomes available). If you have a very nice HD video processor that cleans up/fixes PQ anomalies on your DVD set, then maybe you should stick with your DVDs and wait until the next blu ray release of Star Trek. Let those who demand (and are willing to pay for) PQ perfection wait until another set is released.  Despite some of the DNR and PQ blemish issues, I still highly recommend this box set.

I give 5 plus stars for the many years of fun, inspiring, imaginative entertainment that Star Trek films have provided for me. I love the original TV series and the films with the original casts. I give 4 stars to this box set because it is not the definitive set that Paramount could have (should have?) produced. I think this is the first time in 25 years that I've had the opportunity to re-watch the theatrical versions of ST I TMP, ST II, and ST III. Each blu ray film has 1 or 2 commentaries, 3 or 4 all-new short featurettes in HD, Library Computer, several previously released content in SD, and BD-Live Star Trek IQ.  The bonus disc is a special treat; you will not be disappointed with that content. (Note: The feature about James Doohan is actually in SD, but the written description on the disc indicates HD)

Lastly, go watch the new Star Trek film.  As an old Trek fan since the 1970's, I think the new Trek movie is an excellent, entertaining experience - a blast from the past and future!",1242172800,10,5871,4.352564102564102

I love the director's cuts of the previous set as well as the features. Though I spent more than a hundred dollars for the last set on regular dvd, I would glady pay more for the set on blu-ray....as long as it had ALL the extra features and commentaries.

3785247,2,B001S3GDT0,"Now that I have finally gotten to see the box set for myself, I can contribute to this discussion honestly. I am sad to say that the reports about excessive digital noise reduction are absolutely true. I watched The Motion Picture, Wrath of Khan and sampled the others.

I am very glad to have the original version of The Motion Picture finally, with the original soundtrack. Contrast is generally very good. The colors look vibrant and the picture is clean.  But, it is TOO clean. The picture is heavily scrubbed with digital noise reduction to remove film grain. The problem is that it also removes picture detail and the look and feel of film, which is the whole point of high definition. A film should look like film, not like video. The noise reduction is applied so heavily that clarity changes from shot to shot, depending on how much grain was there. Some shots look almost out of focus. Effects shots with heavy grain become smeared because the processing is so overdone. Faces lose their fine detail and look waxy and unnatural.

I am just shocked that Paramount could be so stupid regarding these films. They know (or should know) that these are highly anticipated by a very discerning fan base. These should be reference quality discs, but they are not. This kind of DNR processing can be done for VHS and maybe DVD, but NOT a high def release. You can't make a film shot on 1980s film stock look like it was shot on 2009 HD video, it doesn't work. Like I said, the colors and contrast look great. A few of the shots in the V'ger interior really pop off the screen. But the image is sterile and has an unnatural quality. In ST III and IV in particular, the actors look like wax mannequins in motion.

The exception is the Wrath of Khan. Although it did not escape the DNR button, it is much lighter. The film has a much more natural and film like appearance. Suprisingly, the color and contrast is not as good, but that is a limitation of the original film stock. Khan is the only film that underwent a full restoration. But restoration is not the issue here. The film elements used for the other transfers are fine. The transfers themselves are actually very good. It is the heavy digital processing done after the fact that is the problem.

How much you notice depends on the size of your monitor. 50"" and up and the waxy faces really stand out. To see what I mean, put on TMP and stand close to your monitor and look at the waxy texture of skin in close ups. Then look at the same thing for Khan. The difference is striking.

The bottom line is that the films don't look bad per se, they just don't look like they should. Many people will be unaware of how much the films were manipulated and how much picture has been scrubbed away. The sad fact is the Paramount obviously just doesn't care about these films or their fans. Star Trek has always been just a cash cow for them. Enough people will buy this set (like me) and they will make their money. Then they can release another blu ray set with the Director's versions and another with properly made transfers of these films and on and on. I didn't own films 3-6, so this isn't a complete waste, but I am sure I will end up buying at least TMP again at some point if they ever get it right. Paramount should fix these and offer replacement discs, but they won't.

UPDATE: For people that don't seem to understand this issue, let me try and clarify. I have seen all of the films and all of the movies are in HD, but were digitally altered. The issue is kind of like colorizing classic black and white films. I am not happy they were digitally tampered with when they would have looked great left alone, with full detail and film grain intact (like Khan was for the most part). Blu ray has the capability to present film very accurately, and this was not done for these discs.

BEWARE: The other movies are NOT new Hi Definition transfers! Digital Noise Reduction was used to reduce the grain. So why buy Blu-Ray copies of old Hi-Def transfers made for DVD releases? You are only going to buy them again when Paramount re-masters them in new transfers!

Some customers may not notice this cheap-out when buying this set. The BIG lettering on the back says ""DIGITALLY REMASTERED WITH BRILLIANT PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY"", but if you look closer you will see the small print says ""The films have been digitally remastered and The Wrath of Khan has been fully restored in high definition picture quality and 7.1 Dolby TrueHD.""

****CLARIFICATION****
Some fans are confused by my review. Let me first say that I am a television engineer, not a novice Blu-Ray owner.  So I want to list some clear facts to help all understand what this set is.

1) Are all of these movies 1080p High Definition video presentations?  YES
2) Do all of these movies have 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Audio?  YES
3) Will all of these movies look better than the older releases?  YES

What is the difference?
Paramount returned to ""Khan""'s original film negatives to make new high definition transfers and restore the movie.  All of the other movies are the 2001 transfers, digitally enhances using DNR technology was the only attempt at restoration.  This is a form of DIGITAL REMASTERING IN HIGH DEFINITION.  And this is the term that confuses the average Blu-Ray collector.  90 percent of the time when a studio claims ""digitally remastered"" on a DVD or Blu-Ray Disc they do NOT mean they went back to the original film negatives to make a new transfer, they just used digital technology to clean up the old transfer.

So why the complaint?
Because we all believe that Paramount will re-release these again, newly ""Restored"" from the original negatives.  If you do not believe that, look back at Paramount's track history of Star Trek releases.",1241568000,308,2063,4.788135593220339

Yes, fans will rush out to buy these movies on BR with the new movie coming out.  Then, in about a year from now, I am sure they will release the directors cuts.

3785255,4,B001S3GDT0,"Got hold of this Box Set on Blu Ray a couple of days ago, first one I played was The Motion Picture, I was prepared for disappointment because it always looks terrible and my previous directors cut dvd was dreadful. However I was impressed with the quality, with the exception of some of the special effects scenes which use third and fourth generation film prints, quality was on a par with the recent Blu Ray james bond releases of Dr No and from Russia with love.

Next up was Wrath of Khan, this is my favourite star trek film as it has the best story, it states on the packaging that this particular movie has undergone extensive restoration so I was expecting even better than the first movie but I was disappointed, the image is by far the worst of the box set, its even worse in a lot of scenes than my unconverted dvd version, I don't know what they've done to this movie but the quality is bad with grain all over the place.

Star trek 3 is on a par with the first movie in terms of quality, so there was no disappointment there, Star Trek 4 is similar but many of the scenes are filmed using various forms of camera filters and the like, so you don't really get to see many clear scenes but this is only down to the quality of the filming techniques used and not the transfer.

Next up Star trek 5 and 6, 5 has some great moments of clarity and again its a good transfer which only dulls in its high def clarity when filters and lighting techniques dull the image, Star Trek 6 is on a similar level to 3 with a good transfer but the story lags a bit and tends to take itself too seriously. The captains Summit is an easy way to pass an hour, you don't really learn anything new except that William shatner has never managed to sit through a complete episode of next generation, that makes two of us.

Overall a decent release, and when you compare it with the likes of Fox's box set of the original planet of the apes movies, or Warners Dirty Harry re-issues on blu ray, you see how good it really is. The only real disappointment is Wrath of khan, ime wondering if they've accidentally lost the negative to this movie or something as the transfer just isn't high def quality, and ime hoping this movie will be remastered again at some point from better source materials.",1241481600,8,2282,4.3

All films are HEAVILY degrained and DNRd (high frequency filtering/""noise reduction""). Almost every fine detail is lost due to this heavy digital processing. Faces look like wax figures from Madame Tussaud's.

The transfers seem to be based on the 2001 remasters. In addition to  that, Star Trek IV, V and VI seem to be old interlaced transfers derived from old 1080i transfers. The degraining on these films is even more obvious and very annoying.

3785258,4,B001S3GDT0,"Firstly we are very fortunate in Australia that we get this set around 2 weeks before the US. The price we pay however is that the set costs nearly double here what it is on Amazon (and that is adjusted for the currency difference). And despite this I am still calling it a worthwhile upgrade
Firstly the good. The movies look about as good as you can reasonably expect. For something that did not go through a Lowry or equivalent frame by frame meticulous restoration this is a good looking set of movies overall (with some reservations as explained below).

As of writing I have only had a chance to fully view the first film and sample parts of II and IV. The Motion Picture was thoroughly impressive. Given low expecations that it was not a restoration like Wrath of Khan I did not expect much. The visuals were thoroughly engaging and the transfer looks like it was done off of a freshly minted print especially for this transfer. There was a visible lack of marks and scratches on the film. Do a compare against the Director's Cut DVD and you'll see a huge number of blemishes on that version. Interestingly the striking visuals of the Theatrical Version were more compelling visually (and more authentic) than the Director's Edition on DVD. For the record I DO NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE but found it compelling viewing until the last act (which becomes a little much). The visual upgrade finally shows what Robert Wise was going for as far as impressive optical effects and these hold up surprisingly well 30 years later. So #1 was a worthwhile watch, prob the most i ever enjoyed this film. The sound was also decent. Not the full range effort of today's best transfers but pleasing enough with generally clear dialogue. I also briefly sampled The Voyage Home and it was generally a pleasing transfer with a solid soundtrack. The upgrade becomes more noticeable if you then compare to the previous DVD editions. You'll find these hard to watch after Blu Ray.
Now for the not so good. Yes, these are theatrical versions and truth be told probably the optimal versions to watch (tighter, less self indulgent and ""original"") but it would be nice to have the choice of the Dir ed or original for completeness. However the most disappointing thing about this set (so far) has been Khan. The packaging notes that this is a fully restored transfer. When putting it in the Blu Ray player I started wondering whether someone substituted the disc on me. From the first half hour or so I watched I noticed the image had a noticeable degradation from the first movie. Likely due to the lower production budget and likely lower quality film stock used. The image had a noticeable lack of sharpness compared to the first film, the sound was rather hollow (seemed like less ADR and more location dialogue, that was at times hard to understand). If this is a restoration I'd hate to see the state of the original elements and I have to wonder whether the restoration work could have been done a lot better. I expected a real showcase for what is considered the best film in the series and so far I was thoroughly underwhelmed. Again it's better than the DVD edition but should be a lot further improved.
The other noticeable thing was the excessive use of video noise reduction or otherwise known as grain removal (esp noticeable on The Voyage Home). The transfer there was generally good, but the grain removal made all the faces look like they were rendered with putty. Unnatural and overly smooth. This made the film less engaging as subtle facial expressions are lost (or rather smeared away). The sound here also lacked the depth you would want to hear from the best High Def transfer.
But, on the whole anyone who likes their Trek should consider picking these up. Even if there is a double, or triple dip coming you can enjoy the films now in the finest quality and technology available today. In our case you pay an arm and a leg for the luxury, but hey...Life is too short. And when they release a superior edition with more compelling content, i'll probably buy it again...and then again a few years later when they come up with something better again. We keep buying new versions of software that are just different enough to warrant a respurchase - why would film be any different?

3785260,5,B001S3GDT0,"Haven't gotten the set yet but I am very much looking foward to this because, simply, the theatrical cuts are the best particularly Star Trek VI - FINALLY in 2:35 to 1 - no more of that 2:20 business.  I saw that film opening night back in '91 and it always played much better than the lame director's cut.  They only cut five minutes out but it is probably some of the dumbest minutes ever in Star Trek.

The additions to Wrath of Khan are not as heinous but they pretty much stink too.

3785261,5,B001S3GDT0,"Since Paramount announced the release of the Original Film Set on Blu-ray, the product has been met with massive criticism, some that praised it and others that did not.  Whether this product is a decent buy is contingent upon certain facts, and for the sake of those who just want to know whether this product is a good buy, consider the following:

FACT 1:  All six films starring Kirk and company are being transferred to Blu-ray!  This fact is a great point for those who love the films and the format.  Others have speculated that the only film that would truly be Blu-ray would be ""The Wraith of Khan,"" but let's be real; That complaint cannot be proven nor denied at this point, so it is not even relevant.  Paramount would face massive lawsuits if they provided customers with less than ""advertised"" product (i.e. recall of ""Jack Ryan Film Collection"")

FACT 2:  The theatrical versions are the ones that will be available in this set (except for maybe one)!  One big disappointment for many is that the director's editions are not going to be part of this set.  So what!  Before anyone's eyes even glanced at the director's editions, anyone who called him or herself a fan loved all or certain favorites of the six films in their original, theatrical presentations.  The theatrical versions are just as good as the director's editions so the quality of the film itself is not marred by that restraint.

FACT 3:  $79.99 is a decent price given what buying all six films individually may cost!  Enough said.

FACT 4:  No one has control over your money and how you spend it but you!  Not to sound preachy, but I for one don't like it when people try to sway me in how I should spend my money, and honestly, most of the negative reviews are aiming to do just that. The whole ""stupid,"" ""fool,"" and ""conned"" attitudes are uncalled for.  So, those of you who are looking to buy this product, remember that you can buy what you want.

I was not expecting much based on all the venom spitting going on here but I am glad you naysayers will be proved wrong.

Paramount could have really dragged this out, by releasing all 6 spread out over time instead of all in one set.  For anyone who got in at $75.99 or $79.99, great deal for Blu-rays at this time.  Only $13.33 a movie!!  Spreading this out with each movie being released separately would have nickel & dimmed us with greater prices per movie.

Note: Theatrical releases of movies are where it's at.  I give you Star Wars for example:  Only the LD definitive collection version is original theater cuts.  To never come out with them on DVD is very annoying.  Yes, I understand folks would like both versions available, but this set has 12 hours of extras & a 7th disc of new material.  Please give it a rest!

Maybe whining takes center stage all too often b/c folks have to be angry to post sometimes.  Also, funny how reviews are posted prior to anyone actually seeing the HD Blu-ray of Star Trek TOS.

---------------------------
Simple if you need to have DC then wait for it.  I don't understand why people are in such a tiff about 9 min of footage.  This is not, I repeat NOT, LOTRs with hours of adds and changes.

DC differences:
The Trek I net 4 min add.
Versions are so different as to make a list nearly impossible.
In general about 4 minutes of footage was cut from the theatrical in the Director's cut. Then about 4 minutes were added to the movie of mostly character bits (Spock crying, Kirk ordering destruct etc.) Some new FX were added to the Dir. cut along with a lot of new sound FX. A longer opening music entre' acte was added and the DC has longer end credits as well. The credits were changed from white lettering to gold. The DC is actually 4 min longer than the theatrical, but seems shorter because the scenes that were cut were mostly non dialogue FX flyby shots and the scenes added in were character driven dialogue stuff.

For Trek II their are 8 changes that amount to 3 min 30 sec.
1. Extension of Kirk/McCoy talking about glasses.
2. Intro of Preston as Scott's nephew in engineering alternate extended take.
3. Extension of Chekov and Carol talking about the order to take Genesis
4. Alternate extended take of carol preparing to hide Genesis from Chekov (Khan)
5. Extension of Spock/McCoy debating Genesis
6. Extension of Preston's death & Kirk/McCoy discussing Khan etc
7. Kirk telling Spock that David is his son in the 'Jeffries' tube.
8. Kirk & Spock telling Saavik about the 'human ego'.

For Trek VI there are 4 changes that amount to 3 min 26 seconds.
1. The Operation Retrieve sequence in the presidents office with Sarek Col West, the CinC & Ad Cartwright
2. Spock, Scott & Valeris in the torbedo storage bay discussing the new Klingon Chancellor.
3. Scott in the dining hall looking at blueprints (no dialogue)
4. The unmasking of the shooter, exposed as Col. West",1240358400,20,3095,4.518850987432675

I have long thought the new version contained many ill-advised and unnecessary cuts, gaudy CGI effects and a heavy-handed audio mix to boot.  Overall, the new version left me with a sour taste in my mouth, and the whole thing came off as being a bit self-indulgent to my tastes.

I'm thrilled to be able to enjoy this 1979 film in it's original form, where at least it actually resembles a film that might have been made in 1979.  Furthermore, I've become a bit tired of this new ""remaster"" process they speak of.  It seems that these days ""remastering"" has more to do with rewriting and re-cutting than a simple clean-up.  Leave these films alone, and accept the fact that they're old.

Blu Ray was meant to be something special but it has become studios way to just release the same films with same process on blu ray.

Thank you for releasing 6 movies at once and not making us wait for 3 years to get the entire collection.  Let's get the final four by the end of the year!

While I'm a big fan of Wise's vision, I can't WAIT to see the version that I haven't seen since ""Sit Long and Prosper"" (give yourself a hand if you remember--and sat through--that).

This release should include both versions (Theatrical and Directors Cut) of each film that are available.  The studio needs to invest a few bucks and give these films a true blu-ray make over.  These films and the characters in them are cultural icons and should be treated as such. Until these films get the proper treatment I'll just stick to my standard DVDs.,1237939200,14,475,4.7682926829268295

The director's edition DVDs of TMP, TWOK and TUC were not the theatrical versions and were never seen in cinemas. Obviously, the high-def presentation will finally meld the best picture quality with the original versions of the movies. I don't see any real issues with that, and if someone really wants to watch the lousy new digital e-Vulcan landscape in TMP, or if they really want to experience Kirk not knowing what a pair of glasses is in TWOK, they can pop in the old DVDs or pay for blu-ray releases of those weak, weak moments when they arrive.

3785294,4,B001S3GDT0,"I personally didn't like the Director's Cuts of the films. I think it took away from the original cut completely.

I didn't like that the tone was different in McCoy's voice when he was explaining the glasses to Kirk in ST2. ""They're for your eyes!"" Really? No way, and Kirk wouldn't know this why? As we've seen in other Star Trek series people do wear glasses sometimes even in the 24th century. This was not in the theatrical cut.

I didn't like when Valeris was explaining who was in the plot to destroy the peace process and they did all the flashes of the people's faces because evidently Nick Meyer doesn't believe that anyone could understand what Valeris was saying. This was not in the Theatrical Cut, it was more dramatic with the camera continuously circling and no breaks in the scene when Valeris and Spock say each persons name.

I think that all the new special effects did not fit in TMP. And why would you cut the ""Get out of here, Bones"" scene at all? Bring on the Blu-Ray releases so I can sell the crappy Director's Cuts.

I'm sure I'm a minority here but I guess I just didn't like the Director's Cuts at all. I gave it 4 stars because they didn't clean up all of the films.",1236643200,10,1196,4.373873873873874

Face it fellow Federation Members until we unite and stop buying these travesties they will keep rolling merrily along picking our pockets as long as they can. A blu-ray release should include everything we deserve as loyal Star Trek customers who have shelled out hundreds if not thousands each over the years and that means re-mastered theatrical and extended releases with all the extras thrown in.

8339418,5,B001S3GDT0,"Kirk, Spock, and McCoy in high definition? Yes please. I have all of the original films on DVD, but I was hoping to upgrade, and stayed away for the longest time because of the price. Then this set came along, and for $25, I was able to buy the original 6 films, and in high definition. Now I can give away my DVDs to some Trek fan who doesn't have access to them, just as someone did for me with their VHS tapes many years ago. I figure pass along the good will, you know?

Now, to the blu-rays themselves: The movies come in a standard multi-disc case, with leaflet disc holders inside. It seems well put together, so I don't fear breaking anything, which is nice.

The movies look terrific. I watched Star Trek V the night they arrived, and it looked SO good, and before you say anything, I *love* Star Trek V. Taking a quick look through them all, the image quality is sharp, clear, and colorful. Everything stands out, and it's like watching them new all over again. For those who might not know, though, there are two things: The Motion Picture is not the Director's Edition, it's the original theatrical. That goes also for Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, which is also the theatrical version, meaning a few scenes are omitted as compared to the DVD versions of these films.

For me, that's a minor quibble, and doesn't affect my overall rating. If you have a blu-ray player, are a Star Trek fan, and are looking to upgrade, this is a solid investment.
