It doesn't have the camp of the original, but it has its own legs....Too bad it is hard to find.",1491782400,,247,4.276595744680851
8134311,5,6303597696,"This is better than the original, and I've watched movies for decades.  Came across this by chance one late evening and was hooked from the start.  It stars the talented and unequaled Redgrave sisters.  Rent it first from your local library if you're not convinced, but you will quickly be ordering it for your own library.  I was actually surprised it was still available but it won't be for long.",1491523200,,398,4.642857142857143
