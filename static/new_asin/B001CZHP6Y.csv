From sharpening, carrying, and various techniques and styles of fighting, this DVD really accomplishes what it set out to do. A lot of people may be swayed away from this product because of Lynn's physical appearance, but don't kid yourself. The guy knows what he is doing, and is surprisingly quick for his size. You can tell a lot of thought has gone into this project. Lynn Thompson and his crew really left no stone unturned when dispensing knowledge about this weapon/tool.",1385769600,5,538,4.858695652173913

8290527,5,B001CZHP6Y,"The Tomahawk is an excellent tool and fighting weapon.  Cold Steel and Lynn Thompson (along with Sifu Ron Balicki and others) teach the Tomahawk like no other.  Lynn Thompson does a tremendous job of stripping away the useless and presents a clear and concise FIGHTING system.  No one is better at presenting a pure fighting system than Lynn and the Cold Steel crew.  Whether you are a seasoned martial artist or a beginner, you will be presented with training principles and drills that will make you a better fighter.  This DVD set not only covers the Tomahawk but other weapons to be used in conjunction with the Tomahawk such as the Bowie and other improvised weapons.  Get this DVD set and some trainers from Cold Steel.  I highly recommend getting the Tomahawk trainer and the Laredo Bowie trainer as well.  Get to it!",1368662400,9,824,4.713286713286713
