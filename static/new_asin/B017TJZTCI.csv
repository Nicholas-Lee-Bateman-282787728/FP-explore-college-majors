8740684,1,B017TJZTCI,Beware: this is the 50's B&W classic with Marie Windsor. misrepresented as a remake. Given the year 2015 and diff. cover art than the original.  prompting me to rent it. Had just watched original and thought I'd give remake a shot. 1st time in 18 years of patronizing Amazon that I have so blatantly been ripped off.,1518998400,,316,4.543859649122807
8740685,5,B017TJZTCI,So fantastically dumb that it is brilliant. NASA ain't got nothing on the tech used to get these travelers to the moon. The science in this SciFi is purely hardcore Hollywood clueless creativity. And the acting...the acting...amazing! Costumes? Stunning! The sets and space scenes? Likewise a pure assault on rational mind. It's a masterpiece of absolute silliness.,1468540800,2,365,5.421052631578948
