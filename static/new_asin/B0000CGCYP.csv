1919204,5,B0000CGCYP,"I bought the region 2 copy off of amazon UK; freaking hilarious stuff.  All the classic moments you've only seen on YouTube are here: the James Bond improv, the ""Dan!"" incident, giving a deceptive tour of Bono's house, etc. Just as the layout of the DVD menus were quirky in the season 1 discs, so it is on this one.  Terrific extra features-- watch for the Anglian Lives special where they feature Alan a few years after he's moved out of the caravan.",1206403200,,452,4.433734939759036

1919206,5,B0000CGCYP,"After losing his chat show, ""Knowing Me, Knowing You,"" Alan Partridge is reduced to working the graveyard shift as a disc jockey at Radio Norwich.  His wife has left him for another man, and he's reduced to living at the three star Linton Travel Tavern.  He's down, but not out.  As he stumbles and bumbles his way through each early morning show, he doesn't give up his dream of returning to the chat show circuit with a second series.  In fact, his dreams of just what he would do to get that show are hilarious, to say the least.

This is the sequel to the uproarious ""Knowing Me, Knowing You.""  Alan is back and is still his usual arrogant, tactless self.  However, there are some differences between these two shows.  The humor in ""I'm Alan Partridge,"" is more deadpan and less outlandish than the humor presented in KMKY.  Also, there is a new cast of characters to enjoy including the patient hotel staff and the ever-vigilant and pliable Lynn, Alan's personal assistant.  Together they weave a fabric of comedy not to be missed.  So if you enjoyed KMKY, you should definitely not miss this one.  Very highly recommended.

1919207,5,B0000CGCYP,"This is an amazing character by Steve Coogan Alan Partridge a selfish self obsessed egotistical T*** at least that's what he comes across as but as we get further through the series we become more and more aware of the strange mind that Alan has.

Every episode from start to finish has you choking from extreme laughter because every word that comes out of the mans mouth is comical genius. Although this will be the only character Steve Coogan is remembered but surely that isn't a bad thing because it is a genius character.

Genius series from start to finish which like i said will have you roaring with laughter.

Buy it you will love it.",1149724800,,644,4.5344827586206895

7999352,5,B0000CGCYP,The second series is as good as the first and includes some of Alan's finest moments. The extras are particularly good - cast commentaries as well as deleted scenes and highlights from his various Comic Relief appearances.,1366416000,,222,5.027027027027027

7999355,4,B0000CGCYP,"The 2nd series of I'm Alan Partridge is a half a notch down from the original series. If for no other reason than that it was made second, so we are already familiar with the mans character and his unusual personality traits.

That said its still a marvellously well written and performed comedy show that is sometimes very funny, and will have you cringing at Alan's antics in places. The standout episode for me is BraveAlan, where he meets a character with similar character traits. Remember the scene in the Car Park where he sees Dan and tries to shout at him to catch his attention. Dan, Dan, Dan! DAN! DAN!! Utterly brilliant.

The extras are well worth seeing, but sadly there is no Steve Coogan on the commentaries, which is a real shame. The first series had Coogan and the commentaries were almost as good as the shows themselves. However the spoof TV interview/documentary is very good and some of the outtakes are worth catching.

So all said and done its not quite the classic that series 1 was, but its close, and I seem to be enjoying it more each time I see it.",1210809600,,1078,4.489795918367347
