8168722,2,B000MGBSNK,"I had hoped that this would be an educational video, but there is no exposition on the mechanics or origins of earthquakes. No maps, no diagrams, no explanations. Nothing. What there is is a handful of firsthand accounts -- from various recent quakes -- about how bad being stuck in the rubble was. These are accompanied by cheap and cheesey camra work meant to simulate an earthquake. What real footage there is seems to be (for the most part) from after-action news footage. There was even some footage of a fire in Kobe, Japan that got run backwards: you could see the smoke being sucked into the flames. There's no education here. The message is ""Earthquakes! They're big, they're scary, and they can happen to you!""",1090540800,,720,4.722222222222222
