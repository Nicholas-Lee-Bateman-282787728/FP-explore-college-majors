Too bad the US version skipped a huge section on India and Versailles under the reign of the sun-king as well as Tavernier's stories. The German and the French ARte versions, not marketed alas, have 25 minutes more (40% longer !!!) of Indian diamond stories and Versailles court reconstruction historical scenes. I'll never understand why the English-speaking audience cannot get this capturing sequence just because that ""americans are not interested by those"" as I was told. Talking with many US friends simply demonstrates just the opposite. And, if we listen carefully to the longer versions, they were recorded mostly in English language and dubbed later in French and German ! This is a very weird decision from NG, as the competitor documentary (The mystery of the Hope diamond) deals significantly with Tavernier travels in India while targeting also the US market.",1375747200,2,961,5.166666666666667
