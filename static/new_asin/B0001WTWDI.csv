2036056,5,B0001WTWDI,"I was at the Toronto Film Festival, and THE STATION AGENT was by far the best film I saw there.  At my screening, we all gave it a standing ovation!  It's so nice to see a movie that feels real--and yet totally interesting.  The performances are great.  Funny, sad.  You love these characters--particularly Peter Dinklage.  He's amazing!  This is a small movie that should be huge.  I highly recommend it!!",1063929600,7,406,4.7

2036076,5,B0001WTWDI,"Finbar McBride is a little person who works repairing model trains in a hobby store.  When his boss and landlord dies suddenly, Finn discovers he has inherited an old train station into which he moves.  His new neighbors are the driver of a food truck, and a preoccupied divorcee who almost accidentally runs him over a couple of times.
Peter Dinklage gives his best performance in this film, ably supported by Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale.  It's poignant, heart-warming and funny in a bittersweet way.  It wone a BAFTA award and was nominated for several SAG awards and other honors.  In my opinion, Dinklage deserved an Oscar for the role.  This is one of my Top 5 favorite films of all time.",1497484800,,703,4.721311475409836

2036092,2,B0001WTWDI,"I didn't care for it. I read all the reviews, I knew it was a Sundance favorite (which, actually, should have served as a warning). I like Dinklage and was looking forward to watching him explore this role. This film was 'built for Sundance' in my opinion. Navel-gazing, shallow, overly contrived and sadly predictable. You never get any closure on the characters, only mis-directed angst. You KNEW there was going to be a self-destructive bar scene. You KNEW there was going to be an overwhelming sense of loss... and as a viewer, I felt the loss was mine. At the end, the overarching expression in the room was ...what the Hell?
No closure... but that's OK, there never seemed a purpose. I enjoyed some of the detail, but lamented so many missing bits. I was distracted from the story line because I lost some continuity. The main character's living arrangement, as presented, left too many questions. What is he doing for water? Is he bathing? Is he eating? How, what? How does he manage to remain shaven and dressed? What is his means of support? Where does he relieve himself? These seem stupid questions but the writer has intentionally contrived the living situation, written in the lack of basic facilities, the lack of water and food and then, after constructing this destitution, makes no effort to show us how the character copes with it. This is completely different form, say, The Terminal, where those questions were answered by the situation. Obviously, the airport has facilities and water, etc. Not here, though, the writer has gone to lengths to construct this isolation and then leaves us to wonder. Why would Joe operate a food truck in THAT location? Because of legacy? the station has clearly ceased to operate as a passenger station. The public no longer passes that way, yet the son continues parking the food truck there because his dad did? The station has CLOSED. Food service trucks DO NOT set up and serve areas where there ARE NO PEOPLE!  This is the vacancy of continuity and logic that Sundance will appreciate in the same way that a blank canvas can be presented as 'art' and certain people will swoon...while the rest of us will just scratch our heads.",1489449600,,2186,4.7678100263852246
2036093,5,B0001WTWDI,"There is surely some ""brand"" name for this type of film but I don't know what it is.  I liked the way the characters were presented and evolved as the story unfolded.  This is one of those ""independent film(s)"" that are so worth watching.",1489276800,,238,4.386363636363637
2036094,5,B0001WTWDI,"Here's another classic movie, so well kept secret with the very talented Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale.  Asmall little movie with a huge impact, emotionally about three lonely people coming together and finding ""friendship"" with each other.  Should have known Peter would go on to better things...Game of Thrones........wow, what a talent.  And, Patricia Clakson is such a talent and has such a lovely figure, why she isn't in more films I do not know.........this film is played over and over in my home.",1488067200,,529,5.127906976744186

2036113,1,B0001WTWDI,This movie was a huge disappointed meant. The ensemble cast worked well together but the storyline was predictable. Technically the editing and camera work were horrible.

2036139,4,B0001WTWDI,"The only reason I'm giving this four stars is, it's not the version with the commentary and extras. The commentary features all the lead actors, giggling joyfully and poking fun at themselves, and - believe me - you'll never watch the movie itself without chorusing ""STELLA!"" again.

Notes on the movie itself - and a SPOILER ALERT. This movie is extremely subtle and riveting. The more times you watch it, the more you'll be surprised.

SPOILER: finally figured out the angry bar scene. The people are NOT making fun of Finn as a dwarf - they're concerned he's socking away too much whisky, too fast. A drinker cheers him as a macho drinker. A couple watches in worry. Even the guys who he had trouble with originally - and are probably feeling ashamed of themselves - note his drinking, and one of them brings him a beer, and pats him on the back. You can almost hear him say, ""Slow down on the whisky, man - have a beer.""

It's that subtle. One of the great movies. Watchable over and over again.",1480464000,,999,4.478021978021978

2036141,4,B0001WTWDI,"If you remember Patricia Clarkson's driving woes in ""Learning to Drive,"" you'll be amused to see her here, early in the movie, twice running Peter Dinklage into the ditch.  This 2003 movie offers some of the same kind of pleasures -- people who are at a loss in their lives beginning, sometimes reluctantly, to move forward into new relationships just at a point where they seem to have taken a self-defeating step backwards.  Dinklage plays Fin (short for Finbar), a dwarf railroad enthusiast from Hoboken who inherits an abandoned station building from a former employer and retreats to it in order to escape being an object of ridicule.  Clarkson is Olivia, the estranged wife of a Princeton academic, who has retreated to a house in the country as she tries to deal with the loss of a child in a freak playground accident.  Bobby Cannavale is Joe, a food-truck operator with a chronically ill father who often requires his attention and who is perhaps sicker than Joe wants to admit.  Both Olivia and Fin are patrons of Joe's truck, and Joe is a pro-active agent in establishing and maintaining relationships, even if his constant chatter and kvetching gets irritating at times, to Fin especially.  The young Michelle Williams (as a librarian) and Raven Goodwin as Cleo, a middle school student who wants to get Fin to talk to her class about trains, both put pressure on Fin particularly to re-engage with world, and as a result (without giving too much away), Fin is able to help Olivia at a critical time.

Tom McCarthy's writing shows a nice ear for the different manners of the main characters, his pacing is economical -- a tidy 90 minutes -- and Oliver Bokelberg's cinematography, both in the indoor locations and in the outdoor locations in which the railway line seems as natural and picturesque as the New Jersey countryside itself, is unshowily effective -- the compositions are unpretentious pleasures for the eye.  The acting is just fine -- this was Peter Dinklage's first major role, and he's very appealing, and Clarkson is a wonderfully natural actress who carries a kind of glamour very quietly.  Cannavale has perhaps the most familiar kind of role, but it's what the emotional dynamic of the movie needs.  Sentimental? Sure.  But the movie is open-ended and doesn't over-promise for its protagonists.  I found it very enjoyable.",1478736000,,2352,4.896725440806045

A poignant exploration of typical human beings, some of whom struggle every day to maintain hope and dignity.

Let alone himself, his dad with medical problems, and i think a car. He couldn't pick a worst location throwing darts at a map. The woman is somewhat believable but not combined with those two. Maybe the point is these people are broken for different reasons. Maybe im taking living life semi-funtional for granted.

2036265,3,B0001WTWDI,"The characters are interesting, the acting is ok and the setting is nice.  But the story line?  There isn't much to discuss about that.  It is an illogical short and shallow tale about 3 quirky people with their own set of problems whose lives connect when one of them inherits a deserted train station.  That's it.  Some humor...not much actually.  Almost zero romance.  In the middle of the movie, you may think it is about to take off and become interesting, but it isn't.  I've seen silent movies which communicated their story much better.  It seemed like the writers didn't want the characters to speak much.  As for the ending...I've been trying hard this morning to say something good or pithy or insightful about it.  I can't, however.  It just stops.  It is like 3 kids got tired of playing with each other and went home.",1470182400,,831,4.609589041095891
2036266,5,B0001WTWDI,"Just a nice film with a nice story. No evil, no really bad elements, a few conflicts, but all in all, the characters are developed so well, each has their own inner conflicts, but three unlikely characters all come together and develop relationships that are charming, complex, yet so simple at the same time. I've had a copy of this movie for years and had never wanted to commit the time. I came across it on Amazon Prime video on my Roku, and I made the commitment. Happy, kind, simple yet complex, Joe is hilarious, Fin is deep and it's so easy to sympathize with him and all he must go through on a daily basis. And the only thing that bothered me is the character played by Patricia Clarkson. She played Olivia and the role was just a bit over-acted. Here she is driving like a maniac multiple times in one scene, running around braless and brainless, no idea where anything is, all flighty, just a bit annoying to be honest. I like her as an actress, but this role was on that ws just not so believable. More so annoying. She's an artist who takes pills, she's weak, has dealt with tragedy, she's supposedly so cool and so laid back , but the blink of an eye she does a 180. I dunno, Finbar and Joe were so well developed, both performances were great and Patricia Clarkson was a great actor. I just really dislike many thing about that particular role. Sorry Patty, it's not you, it's me. But no question, I loved the movie!",1470182400,,1432,4.367041198501872

I loved the direct innocence of the little girl (played by Raven Goodwin, who was about eleven at the time), although innocent questions can be as uncomfortable as ignorant, mean-spirited comments and questions.

It's a great story about the human need for social interactions: how strangers who are thrown together bond and become friends. It's an uplifting experience to watch.",1469577600,,656,4.954545454545454

Sleep aid rating: five stars.  I fell asleep to this film at least seven times before I got through it.  As someone who watches movies to help me fall asleep, this is a good thing.

Although it's praised very heavily for being so much like real life, and in many ways this is accurate, I found that it was a little unrealistic.  Finn wants to be left alone, and repeatedly rejects the people who want to befriend him.  They are determined to be his friends, though, and they keep on persisting until he finally lets them in.  In real life, though, being strongly introverted usually turns other people away.  Nobody will force a friendship on another person.  That said, it's not a bad idea to be persistent in trying to befriend someone.  This film highlights the fact that people need human connections, and that there's no reason to isolate yourself from others.",1469232000,,960,4.7926829268292686

2036362,5,B0001WTWDI,"WOW! What a gem! This movie is quiet and unassuming, yet very powerful. ALL of the performances (Dinklage, Canavale, Clarkson) are spot on. This always feels like a slice of like where we are the voyeurs, not like a movie where you are acutely aware of the trappings.

It's a simple story about a man named Finn who happens to be a dwarf, and wants to live out his quiet life without getting too close to anyone. Every day people make fun of him or react in ways that are less than polite.
He meets Joe, a loquacious and bubbly guy who for his faults, at least sees Finn as a man (not just a dwarf). Their paths intersect with Olivia (Clarkson) who is a fragile soul herself having lost her son before the movie starts (hence it's not really a spoiler, lol!) and is in rocky condition.

It's a story of how we need each other. ""What are we here for, if not to help each other?"" ~ G. Elliot",1467849600,,889,4.192982456140351

Peter Dinklage, the small guy,Patricia Clarkson the painter and the new face Bobby Cannavale were perfectly matched together.
At the beginning Patricia was kind of over acting with driving her car like crazy -not once but twice- almost hit the Peter. I almost thought the movie will be sucks.
But as time goes by I felt the warm heart-the relationship between the three people made me want to see them forever.
When the movie was finished, I almost felt like missing them already.
Peter, because he is a dwarf, he was always sad, Patricia, her son passed away and trouble with her ex-housband, Blbby needed a new friend. They got together and that is the happiest moment. And that moment even made us happy too. And that is the main point of this movie.

2036482,5,B0001WTWDI,"This is a terrific movie, and for all the right reasons.

It is first and foremost a minimalist taleone that tells its story with a smallest amount of dialogue, action, setting  you name it. Shots take place with hardly a word, and end before they seem to begin. Yet this is not any Ingrid Bergman movie where characters stare at one another with baleful, meaningful looks  no, this movie works with an understatement of words, but not of meaningful activity.

THE STATION AGENT is Finbar McBride and he is played by the talented Peter Dinklage of GAMES OF THRONE, and though much is made of his being a little person, the part could almost be written for any person with a noteworthy reason for wishing society would leave him alone. Dinklages face is SO expressive, so wounded by the manner in which society manhandles its own curiosity, that his desire to be alone never has to be explained any further  and it isnt, not once.

No, TSA tells its story in great part due to its bevy of interesting characters. They are each different, each with their own tale that really could have managed a movie of their own. Patricia Clarksons Olivia Harris is a mess of a person, waylaid by a pending divorce caused by the death of her son, who is muddling through life and making a wreck of everything. There is the cute librarian, stuck with a big-mouthed deadbeat boyfriend; there is the elementary schoolchild who sees him first as a human being with a fascinating hobby, and asks him simply, What grade are you in?

But the movie really belongs to Bobby Cannavale, a man whose in-your-face charismatic friendliness is so charming and disarming that he could have made Winnie the Poohs Eeyore giggle.  He is all heart, and his earnest desire to draw Fin into his life, to simply befriend a man who is so exotically different from anyone he has ever known that it is almost impossible to dislike him.

THE STATION AGENT won not only vast praise from critics (and a 95% FRESH rating from Rotten Tomatoes), it has the offbeat charm of, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benny-and-Joon/dp/B000053VAZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benny and Joon</a>, though decidedly darker in its comic tone. It is a film that really put both Peter Dinklage and Bobby Cannavale on the map, exposure-wise. But more than its awards, it is a movie that is both fascinating and endearing, a movie that will end much too soon, but carry on in your heart and mind.",1452988800,,2476,4.862232779097387

2036488,5,B0001WTWDI,"This is such a quiet, small film that delivers such a powerful message.

So much to love about this film, especially the 3 main characters.  Bobby Cannavale (as Joe), Patricia Clarkson (as Olivia) and particularly Peter Dinklage (as Fin) are really exceptional.  And please don't overlook Raven Goodwin (as Cleo) who, with her few scenes, makes quite an impression.

And for a film that becomes a statement on the beauty and importance of friendship, it's so interesting that 2 of the 3 main characters are dragged into it kicking and screaming the whole time.  So cool.

So much great dialogue, but one of my favorite exchanges is this:

Fin: ""You promised you wouldn't talk (during lunch), Joe.""
Joe: ""I haven't said anything for 20 minutes.""
Fin: (looks at his watch) ""Nine.""
Joe: ""You timed me?""
Fin: ""Mm hmm.""
Joe: ""That's cold, bro.""

2036490,2,B0001WTWDI,"I saw this today n' I wanted to like it, but didn't.

Someone from the NY Times mentions that it was 'hilarious'. How? It was honestly not a comedy in the least. Maybe some people are mean and just thought it was funny because of Mr. Dinklage's (Fin's) short-height?

There was one smile from me from one moment Fin said something, but that was it. This movie's just about a lonely man and is quite depressing. People make fun of him and he's become someone who wants to be left alone with his interest in trains. Eventually, he opens-up a little bit. Now, when I read in the writeup that he ""...discovers his isolated depot is more like Grand Central Station"", that's what I wanted: encounters with a lot of goofy characters and how this person became more interested in people. He really just interacts with four people n' nothing was funny.

And what's up with Fin not even asking Olivia what the heck he did for her to suddenly just be mean to him? It all took place after she spoke to the man she was separated from, and we know what she's upset about later, but she really laid it into Fin before (yelling at him to go away and saying how she's not his mother or girlfriend). I guess he's a shy-guy who's been hurt before, but ... man, say SOMETHING! In the end, we have not details about why he's as he is (using short words...wanting to be alone...not accepting rides, etc.)

Oh, and the three main-folks smoke marijuana. Did something hilarious then? Nope. Fin mentions of how horses are also cool when they are watching a video of chasing a train they made. Wow.

This was just about a beginning of some friendships and there was not much happening. ""Pieces Of April"", which also stars Patricia Clarkson, is equally pretty-dull and absent of much of a story, but it was more appealing.

So, Peter Dinklage's acting was fine and the lovely Michelle Williams brightened this mess up, but this surely wasn't up to the level of the praise-quotes on the package (a ""real treasure"" according to Ebert & Roeper; ""movie you want to share with others"" from NY Times; a ""breath of fresh air"" according to someone named Leonard Maltin).",1448755200,,2135,4.532467532467533

2036524,5,B0001WTWDI,"A prepossessing but reclusive character, Finbar McBride ( Peter Dinklage), in the frame of a little person, is a magnet for people ; some with good intentions, some with bad. For a long-standing loner, this poses some problems. Fin inherits a train depot in a small town in New Jersey and makes it his home.  Gregarious, affable Joe (Bobby Cannavale), his first acquaintance, runs a little food truck outside Fin's front door.  Olivia ( Patricia Clarkson), his second, presents as more than a little distracted,  repeatedly running him off the road with her car (he walking), as if trying to set a record for the greatest number of pitches of a person into a ditch in the shortest time span. A light and easy humor brightens this story of separateness and connectedness.  Both strangers are insistent on befriending Fin.  In a very small town, likely inhabited by fewer commanding personalities, Fin's barriers pose no obstacle for them. Fin loves trains. He loves to see them, delights in the flickering lights and shadows they cast. His pleasure is to walk their tracks, clock them, watch movies about them and , ultimately,  shoot his own trainchasers. Cleo (Raven Goodwin), an inquisitive and friendly young girl, convinces a very reluctant Fin to share some of his knowledge about trains with her classmates.  He fares well. He shows patience with the curiosity of young children.  By contrast, a bar scene, in which he is alone, reminds us of the cruelty directed at the different one.  Olivia, Fin, and Joe become a cohesive team. Their life stories are eventually shared and, more and more, they become each other's buddies and protectors. The capture, from wonderfully diverse perspectives, of Fin walking the track alone, or as part of a pair, or as one of three in single file is pure choreography. Fin is seen standing atop a rail car, his head framed by the lush green canopy of tall trees  The cinematography is outstanding.  A train passes in full representational glory;  then in another scene it moves by as a reflection on a wall, having the feel and tempo of an early motion picture.  That we are social animals is prominent here, that we suffer wounds that may cause us to isolate is also true,  and the final piece may well be that the longing for that human connection often prevails, as it does in this simple and profound story.  A Sundance winner, this film is brilliantly acted, skillfully written and directed by Thomas McCarthy.  Highly recommend.",1445731200,4,2475,4.843230403800475

Fin is shy and wants to be alone. And being a dwarf doesn't help. Olivia is an artist with her own personal problems. Joe is like a puppy dog: he so wants to be friends with Fin and Olivia.

It had everything - the irritated introvert (I can relate), the ""friend"" that follows you like a lost puppy, an artist, a house by the water's edge and some train chasing. It was awesome. There's no real action in this movie, it is a very relaxed look into the lives of three ""bored"" people coming to gather to form friendships and that's it. It probably makes for a slow movie for many, but I was completely into it. What a gem. Totally worth the time watching. I highly recommend.",1436832000,,545,4.300970873786408

It's difficult to describe, so I'm not going to bother - and it's better not to know too much, just let it reel you in. It's worth your time. Be aware there's no shooting, killing, special effects.

2036663,5,B0001WTWDI,"I am an avid movie buff, especially the older films from the 40s to 60's -- with a smattering of movies in between those years and present day.
I am not into modern or trendy kinds of movies, but am drawn to unique movies that can take a story idea and not need special effects or big names to carry the film and be a good one at that.

This is one of those movies that is a gem in a different box. I rarely give out 5 stars, but I have to do it for this film. I have watched this movie at LEAST a dozen times and still do not get tired of it. In fact, even though I will watch it online with Amazon Prime....I bought the DVD of it so I can watch it without having to turn the computer on.

Peter Dinklage really does an excellent job showcasing the non-stop problems with life ... with a unique life interest in trains and inheriting an abandoned little train station in the middle of nowhere ... as a dwarf with all of the abuse he has to take from insensitive people on a regular basis.
He just wants to be left alone...and even in a tiny town that can't happen.

People may see this as a slow-moving story, and I think that was done on purpose.

Finally, this is a film that you should get all of your snacks and drinks set up so you can watch it undisturbed.

Again, a gem....and worth 5 stars!",1435190400,,1299,4.01937984496124

2036677,5,B0001WTWDI,"I happened to find this movie on Netflix when looking for movies that Peter Dinklage is in. I didn't know if it was going to be any good and I'm SO glad I hit play! The movie was amazing, Peter Dinklage gave a wonderful performance, as he does in every thing I have ever seen him in. I have not seen Patricia Clarkson before but she was very real and believeable in her portrayal of a woman who is dealing with her sons loss and her husband divorcing her. The scene where Dinklage and Clarkson meet is hysterical and it gets the ball rolling. Bobby Canavale is the happy go lucky food truck owner who drags Dinklage out of his shell and gets him engaged in living a life surrounded by friends. This movie has its darker side and it deals with all the ranges of emotions. It will leave you with a smile and I hope, like me, you will fall in love with this movie and watch it over and over for many years to come!",1434240000,6,911,4.123595505617978

Peter Dinklage (who has New Jersey family connections) is masterful.  The supporting cast is top-notch, led by Patricia Clarkson. Excellent work.  Several story lines (Dinklage the dwarf loner, Clarkson the bereaved mom, Cannavale the fun-loving, but responsible son) merge into one pleasant Summer movie...filmed in that mecca of Summer movies: New Jersey.  Dinklage and Clarkson want to be left alone, Cannavale is the conversational counterpoint, and their solitude is nicely resolved by sharing their lives.",1433548800,2,673,5.261682242990654

This is a film about hope, especially for anyone who feels marginalized, is weird (like who isn't in some way?)  but okay with living in the moment, and is open to letting others into one's space.

As someone who lived in West Milford/Newfoundland NJ for many years, it is wonderful to see how our old train station was used as a centerpiece for such a unique and wonderful story!  The fact that the film makers also managed to include truly local elements (the hot dog truck and Good To Go Deli down the road in Rockaway, for example) made it all the more special.  I recommend this film to anyone who wants a change from the standard formula films that dominate our cinemas, and to anyone who wants to see some of Peter Dinklage's film work before Game of Thrones.

It's true it's not exactly loaded with action, but any time Peter Dinklage spoke, you paid attention! It's a little sad that they call this Patricia Clarkson's movie, because it's really Peter Dinklage's. Who would ever have thought that a dwarf would star in a movie? It must have been hard to market that way. But he is a small person with a large presence--thoughtful, complicated, introspective. I loved the interplay among the three leads and the slow burn as they build a friendship.

W films like this there is almost ALWAYS a scene that mis- or backfires. But here,there really isn't one. What it would usually be is --

PLOT REVEAL

-- either the scene where we find out what happened to her son, or the scene when we find out her ex- is having another child. But here those scenes work -- and the scene where Clarkson and Dinklage kiss, he doesn't make the most of it, and he and we know he never will...

A really nice film.

2037006,5,B0001WTWDI,"""The Station Agent"" is an offbeat and engaging tale of three rather unique individuals whose lives intersect at an abandoned train depot in rural New Jersey.

Peter Dinklage plays Finbar, who works in a model train store owned by his friend Henry Styles (Paul Benjamin). After Henry suddenly dies, Finbar inherits from him an abandoned train station near the town of Newfoundland, NJ. Finbar decides to move to New Jersey and live at the station where he arouses the curiosity of Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale), who runs a roadside coffee wagon and forces himself into Finbar's life with relentless cheerfulness. Finbar also makes the acquaintance of Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), who is going through a divorce and is in mourning for the death of her child.

All three of the principle cast members deliver sincere and natural performances. Peter Dinklage gives a charismatic and restrained portrayal that allows his silence to speak volumes. In contrast, Bobby Cannavale is highly amusing as the chatty and extroverted Joe, while Patricia Clarkson brings out unexpected layers of depth in her performance as Olivia.

""The Station Agent"" is sometimes dark and uncomfortable and not a conventional Hollywood feel-good slice of life movie, but it ultimately proves to be an uplifting experience and one that will leave you with a smile on your face.",1423440000,15,1351,5.159817351598173

If the message is that we, as humans, all have issues and could be more supportive then why trip over your liberalism of highlighting the ""eccentric""?

2037234,4,B0001WTWDI,"Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson, and Paul Benjamin are a cast of unlikely characters thrown together in this small New Jersey town. I love that Dinklage has been fortunate enough to get rolls that are truly 3 dementional characters and not only centered around a comedy of his physical differences. His character in this roll is deffinanly shaped by societies reaction to him as a little person...but it's very central to the story as it has made his character somewhat of an introvert and unable to easily form strong bonds with people. Clarkson's character is a bit of a clumsey artist type at first, but we slowly learn she is dealing with a tragic situation in her life which also makes her want to retreat from people. Benjamin plays Joe....a young guy full of life and energy who is so board in this little town he is starved for the company of anyone! Joe who is dealing with an ageing father (which is why I suspect he is still in this small town) basically forces his way into the lives of these two damaged souls, creating this small circle of 3 hesitant friends.",1415059200,,1075,4.604166666666667

I knew the lead actor would keep her interested (I've seen the reality shows my wife watches).
The movie was pretty funny, (and had it's sad parts too) I actually enjoyed it a lot. More that most chick-flicks. My wife did too.
Normally, my movie choices trigger some kind of Candy-Crush impulse.. But not this one. She watched it all.

Keep your lady happy, watch this one with her! :)

2037582,5,B0001WTWDI,"Offbeat and both sad and funny, The Station Agent is a surprise and a wonderful one.  ""Fin,"" a dwarf, is self-possessed and after losing his best and possibly only friend to a sudden death, uninterested in other people whose reactions to him have left him with scars, leaves the city and partially walks to a small town in Newfoundland, N.J.  Here, he moves into an abandoned train station which he has inherited from his former friend.  This arrangement suits him just fine, because trains are what Fin lives for in all their forms such as actual trains, models, books and so on.  The story moves along as ""Joe"" who runs a food truck, pulls into the property the train station sits on.  Joe is a gregarious type who is clearly fascinated with Fin, but in a disarming way.  Since hardly anyone stops at the food trunk where it sits daily, Joe has oodles of time to kill and attaches himself to Fin who is finally aware that his rebuffs go unheeded and that he may as well give in.  Then, there is Olivia who lives in the town in a gorgeous second home on a lake, an apparent artist, who has left her husband.  She is a careless driver who meets Fin, by literally running him off the road he is walking on (twice!) as he goes to the local convenience store for provisions.  Olivia starts out as quirky but her real life and her memories of her dead child start to take a toll on her. These three, plus a spunky young African-American girl, ""Cleo"" and ""Emily,"" the librarian make up the bulk of a cast of people who are brought together by Fin's unassuming arrival in town.  It is a tale that explores loneliness and friendship and the realization that life is better with the latter.",1409097600,,1682,4.431818181818182

2037900,4,B0001WTWDI,"I love when a movie makes me want to write a review; when it can force a flood of emotions through me all at once. When this happens, I know I've just enjoyed a film. The Station Agent is that kind of film. Released in 2003, the movie Written and Directed by Thomas McCarthy (2012, Meet the Parents, Up) is impressive. I was touched. So many aspects of the story really hit me hard. At only 89 minutes, I admit I was sad to see it end.

The movie stars Peter Dinklage. I have been a long time fan of Dinklage, since long before Game of Thrones. I feel like Dinklage is finally earning the respect deserved as an amazing actor if only thanks to the HBO series. stationagent

The synopsis on IMDB reads: When his only friend dies, a man born with dwarfism moves to rural New Jersey to live a life of solitude, only to meet a chatty hot dog vendor and a woman dealing with her own personal loss. This is more of a simple log line. It does not convey the heartfelt scenes and simple dialogue that builds the story and just moves the plot constantly forward.

Fin McBride, portrayed by Peter Dinklage, is something of a boring man. As a dwarf, he seems accustomed to ogling stares, childish taunts and strangers taking his photograph. While he does his best to ignore the obscene behavior of others, there is no way it does not eat away at him. No way it does not slowly destroy his soul. When his employer dies, he learns he has been left a small piece of property and decides to move into an old train station in an attempt to hide from everyone, from life.

Unfortunately, (or fortunately), his ""neighbor,"" Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale), runs an hot dog stand next door. Overly friendly, and chatty, we learn that he lives life to the fullest while dealing with a sick and elderly father.

PeterDinklageThe amazing Patricia Clarkson plays Olivia Harris; a married woman who is dealing with the recent death of a child. Rightfully so, her absent-minded behavior is nearly aloof as she tries to piece together puzzles about life that just won't fit anymore.

It may not seem it, but all three suffer from a need for seclusion, as well as for a chance or opportunity to figure out what life is all about. With no easy answers, with no real definition as to why or how, what or what for . . . the three bond as friends, as foes, as people. Their complex backgrounds are clear and apparent and depressing.

The relationships feel right. Genuine. The minor characters are strong, and just interesting enough to make the entire cast complete, full.

With completely compelling characters and an amazing story line, McCarthy 's has shared with everyone a movie that should NOT be missed. The Station Agent is heartfelt and inspirational. It is one of those rare films that long after it is over, you know will not forget it.  Ever.

2037902,3,B0001WTWDI,"The Station Agent could best be described as a film that offers one a look at the lives of three people struggling to deal with personal challenges. The film was listed as a comedy, but I would not call it a comedy.  My biggest problem with the film lies in how it ties together the lives of the three main characters. This seems to have been staged very artificially. However, the lead character does offer us a different perspective than most ""slice of life"" type films.",1405382400,,472,4.488372093023256

2037915,4,B0001WTWDI,"A charming movie that brings three unique individuals, Finbar, Joe, and Olivia together in a way that we can appreciate. Not unique in themselves, but in what life has brought them. Each struggles with their situation, and somehow develop a quirky, yet caring relationship with each other. To complicate matters, Finbar and Olivia try to cope with the personal suffering from events and factors that they cannot control.

The film is further enriched with two endearing, supporting characters whose stories we only glimpse in passing. The young schoolgirl Cleo, who like Finbar, loves trains and by her sheer force of will, becomes his friend.  And the local librarian Emily, who first frustrates Finbar and then develops a unique, endearing relationship after revealing her personal problem.

The screenplay is very impressive for such a small, yet appealing story. The characters are not endearing initially, but they grow on you. Each performer was impressive in their own way, especially Peter Dinkage in his role as Finbar.  The cinematography was especially delightful, with the rural scenery and camera angles visually appealing.  And the train chasing scene was fun, though way to short.

2038000,5,B0001WTWDI,"In an age of mindless entertainment for the masses this film stands out as an example of what can be done without special effects, huge budgets and big names. This is a film for a thinking person and it is one of the best examples of good character development I've ever seen. There are no car chases, gunfights, nudity or explosions; so if you need those things to be entertained, pick something else. If you enjoy a morality play that's deep but not dark, you may want to watch this one.
The main character is very secure in who he is. Even though he is a loner in some sense, he interacts with those around him. At first those interactions are forced upon him but later he seeks out that human interaction from those will become his friends. His strength of character quietly and slowly lifts up those around him. In the process, his life becomes better. He's not the conductor, he's ""The Station Agent"".",1404604800,,907,4.503030303030303

2038004,4,B0001WTWDI,"This timeless film shows the humanity of people dealing with their struggles, the desperation of the moments when needs clash and the genuine goodness in the soul of everyone.  The Station Agent is a character study that tells a simple story yet manages to still pop visually.

2038011,4,B0001WTWDI,"I did not know what to expect when I started this one. But, the rating for me, would have been five stars if it wasn't for some what I thought were unnecessary scenes. Watching the female lead sitting in front of her mirror in her underwear did not add to her character or motivations whatsoever. Other than that I found it to be enjoyable, a little SLICE OF LIFE type of film.  If you are looking for Hollywood action, Victoria's Secret models, magazine hunks,  sex, blood, fantasy superheroes or characters, forget it!!!  This was a pleasant reprieve from all of that.  It made me want more, at the end, wanted to see these peoples continuing stories.....Just a nice pleasant film,  that I  will enjoy watching over.",1404259200,,718,4.658730158730159

2038029,4,B0001WTWDI,"Three characters cross paths in this quirky story about a reclusive man named Fin who inherits a train depot property and sets out to live there, presumably because he has nowhere else to go after the death of his friend and owner of the model train store where they both worked. After he arrives at the depot, he meets two locals who add comedy and drama to this story. The three become friends and the film looks into how the two locals are drawn to the mysterious Fin and his world of trains. The film moves slowly and quietly drawing you into the small-town story of these ordinary but extraordinary people. I found my self laughing during very subtle, oddly humorous scenes that just snuck up on me. The actors do a great job in this peek into the lives of three very different characters. I enjoyed it very much.",1404000000,,818,4.46

The cast is good and the acting is great but the story itself is very slow. When we got to the end of it we sat there wondering why we watched the entire thing but at the same time we were glad we did. I know that doesn't make sense but that is how we felt.
It is basically the story of three lonely people that develop a friendship with each other, but it wasn't until the end of the movie that we were able to determine what it was about.
Did we enjoy it? Yes....and no!
Do we recommend it? Yes....and no!",1404000000,,598,3.950413223140496

I apparently got it mixed up with another movie and thought it was going to be a taut political thriller from Brazil (???) --- totally wrong. Instead, it's a simple story of a man (Peter Dinkelage from ""Game Of Thrones"") who gets the opportunity to to get away from the world that has taunted him all his life, but instead, finds acceptance that he'd never experienced before.  Also featuring Bobby Cannale (""Boardwalk Empire"") and the always wonderful Patricia Clarkson. Don't wait to see it like I did --- watch it today!",1403827200,,720,4.373134328358209

Lessons gleaned by watching these masterful actors play out an excellent story.  Not forced morals or ham-handed beliefs shoved onto us.  Instead, you pull meaning into your own life after watching this film.  The way you do after finishing a well-written novel.

Perhaps the main character wanted to live that sort of life, but instead due to others, he begins to see his own song.  Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson, and Bobby Cannavale bring to life the story of three people each  living their own lives brought together by chance circumstances. While the main character is, yes, a Dwarf, the story does not center on his disability but his desire for isolation from being hurt as a result of it. Many of us can identify with this desire for all of us have been deeply hurt at one time or another.

2038129,5,B0001WTWDI,"This is one of my favorite indie films of all time. You would think that the story of a quiet introverted man would drag, but this movie never does. Long before ""Game of Thrones,"" Peter Dinklage was doing brilliant stuff here, and Patricia Clarkson is wonderful as usual. Even if the premise doesn't appeal to you on the surface, give this film your attention. It won't let go.",1402185600,,377,4.5588235294117645
2038130,4,B0001WTWDI,Some quirky characters who obviously cared for each other. Slow moving with an underlying message to take people as they are. Well acted and all together enjoyable.

2038131,4,B0001WTWDI,"I struggled writing this review (preceding 5 words were written as an afterthought) - This movie was very slow and not a lot happened in it, however, for some reason I liked it.  I think had it not been for the character Joe I wouldn't have liked it but he had this optimistic happy personality whereas Olivia was sad and Finn preferred few words and keeping to himself because of him being a dwarf (his words) and the way people would react to him.  There wasn't much storyline, just the day to day struggles of these three people and their interaction with each other ultimately making their lives happier.",1402099200,,608,4.568807339449541

2038133,5,B0001WTWDI,"The best kind of movie is the one that explores relationships. You know, without blowing up things or utilizing fantastic technology that won't exist for another ten decades. The kind of relationships that make you think, ""Hm. I could totally see myself in that situation. With those people.""

Even when the setting is a s***ty little New Jersey town where no one lives. Because the portrayal of the characters is realistic without looking like something you see everyday. If you wanted everyday, all you'd have to do is keep doing what you're doing or go to the Wal-mart, or to church, or to your job. This film puts the characters in an unusual circumstance, bringing three people who otherwise would not have come together as friends, and all because one of them inherited a piece of crap property that, so far, no one cared about or even noticed.",1402012800,,850,4.743243243243243

No car chases with fiery wrecks, no explosions or comic book type heroism.  Story probably gets a B, Acting gets an A+ however. The cast are magic together, even if we don't know how they all came to be.  Already find myself rambling.

It is skillfully understated. The writing, the acting and the cinematography were superb.  There were painfully human scenes, and joyful ones.  I can see where some might say it doesn't really resolve. But it does, in the best way it could have.

We turn more and more to amazon prime, hunting for good drama, comedy, and non-fiction offerings. What a nice surprise when we chose The Station Agent one evening this week. It had won at Sundance, so we decided to try it.

It is a beautiful movie that mixes humor and sadder emotions, quirky people and charming setting. Reminded me a little of Big Fish, though not as ""magical."" Could not have asked for improvement. Really enjoyed it.",1401494400,,606,4.716981132075472

Let's you feel the moments of quietude that surround the characters and influence their desire as strangers to be kind and get to know one another.  There is no one else around and each of them carries a loneliness of their own which brings them to together as well as helps them understand when to persist and breakdown the barriers they erect when they are in fresh pain.

However, the story is kind of boring. I am not quite sure what the story is trying to convey, love? friendship? the miserable life as being a dwarf? It seems like there is not such a single point that the story is trying to emphasize. throughout the entire movie, I can feel loneliness deep in each character's soul. Olivia, a divorced lady living alone; Joe, a talkative guy actively trying to make friend with Fin ( probably Fin is the only one he can talk to); Fin, a reserved guy who is the best friend with loneliness. Unlike some metropolis cities like New York, they are ordinary people living in a small town, I can imagine and understand how peaceful and serene the life would be there, though I would definitely feel lonely as a 20+ girl from a crowded big city in China. If I watched this movie when I was still in China, I would definitely be looking forward to the peaceful and wonderful life there in the movie.

2038295,5,B0001WTWDI,"first rate acting. peter dinklage (from game of thrones) is perfect. he has quickly become one of my favorite actors. I hope he continues to find parts of this quality. a small but insightful film about the human heart, and the power of friendship. dinklage plays a lonely man who because of his size (he thinks) has few friends. when his one true friend dies , leaving him a small piece of property in NJ, an old abandoned train station, he goes there to claim his property and moves in. he and his friend had worked at a train model store. we see dinklage's character trying to avoid human contact, essentially a loner, and the impact some more outgoing people in his new environment (all with their own problems) have on his life. this is not a Debbie downer melodramatic film. it rings true all the way around, and is an uplifting story about being drawn out of one's shell and finding friendship, and the importance of friendship. wonderfully done, a real treasure.",1400803200,,970,4.61271676300578

It's a story of real life friendships, very heartwarming yet sometimes bothersome.",1400716800,,345,4.766666666666667
2038323,5,B0001WTWDI,"Have you ever had a daydream about becoming a hermit?  If so you may find a kindred spirit in the Station Agent's main character, Finbar McBride, played by the talented Peter Dinklage.  Finbar's goal of becoming a recluse is not successful,however, and this may be the main charm of this movie.  Finbar, who just wants to be left alone has to contend with others who intrude upon his self-induced isolation. Enter Joe Oramus,(played by Bobby Cannavale) and Olivia Harris (played by Patricia Clarkson).  This quirky trio seems to share few commonalities.  Joe is the extroverted and devoted son who takes over his dad's hot dog/coffee food truck while his father is ill.  Olivia is a shy artist who is dealing with the death of her young son and the demise of her marriage.  And Finbar is  a train enthusiast who has just lost one of his only friends who has left him an old train depot in the middle of Nowhere New Jersey.  Despite their superficial differences, each character attempts to deal with emotions such as anger, grief, and pain by shutting out the world in their own way. Yet the desire for human connection wins out in the end.  The desire to share both the joys and sorrows in life is what unites these individuals in a strong and loyal friendship.  Their initial tenuous and awkward attempts at connection might make us cringe.  It takes a very patient movie viewer to see the story to the ""end"" where the characters don't have to work so hard at either actively avoiding or initiating human contact.

I found the vicarious journey towards connectedness to be well worth it.  In fact, I can easily say that The Station Agent is my new favorite movie.

This is a film that you may have missed when it first came out (2003) but maybe you heard about it recently due to Peter Dinklage's rise to fame from his portrayal of  Tyrion Lannister in the HBO series Game of Thrones, which earned him both an  Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Supporting Actor in 2011.  In fact I was one those people who had never heard of The Station Agent until this year (2014).  I first heard about this film from reading a recent Esquire interview with Peter Dinklage. During the interview Dinklage talks about a random but poignant moment when a clearly distraught woman recognizes him on the street.  She tells him that her boyfriend, who had died that very day, was a huge fan of Dinklage and that The Station Agent had been one of his favorite movies.  The woman took this remarkable chance meeting as some sort of special sign.  Dinklage seemed to think so too and described the event as meaningful.  Intrigued by this interview, I decided that I had to see The Station Agent for myself.

For those who said that The Station Agent was not what they expected, I can understand this sentiment.  You really don't know what kind of movie this is until you are well into it.  And for some, it seems that even ten minutes of viewing the movie was enough to call it quits.  This clearly is not a movie to suit everyone's tastes.  While I generally don't like when reviewers categorize people who like or don't like a particular film, I will say that it probably helps if you are an introvert to easily appreciate The Station Agent.  But by no means is introversion a prerequisite for liking or even loving this very unique gem of a film.  Whether you are an introvert or extrovert, the need to be alone with your anger, grief, or pain, is something most of us can relate to and comprehend.

The criticism that this movie is ""boring"" or that ""nothing happens"" seems to be the consensus of those who gave this film one or two stars.  The fact that there are so many negative reviews, essentially saying the same thing, seems to illustrate the dichotomous nature of movie goers.  There are people who are going to ""get"" this type of film and those who have no patience for it.  Some reviewers who gave 1-2 stars actually apologized saying in effect, ""I really wanted to like this movie but I just didn't.""  Perhaps expectations get in the way of enjoyment of such a film.

One of the expectations generating disappointment was that some thought this would be a laugh out loud comedy.  Maybe, at best, The Station Agent could be described as a dark comedy.  The humor was there but it was very refined and subtle. Some people wanted more action.  Although a lot happens in this film as far as personal growth and change, no, there is not much action packed drama.  Yet the lack of action was a plus for me.  The slowness of the film forced me to slow down as well.  It was only then that I could appreciate the specialness of waiting for a train or even the beauty of what we consider to be awkward silences.  And too, there were those who called this a depressing film.  I can understand how that description could be derived yet having watched the entire movie, I felt the opposite of depressed.  I felt inspired. There was growth for each of the characters, however slow it seemed to happen. The Station Agent seems to be one of those movies that you either love or hate.

And too I think a lot of people might get caught up in the fact that the main character is a little person.  While this fact is addressed in The Station Agent, and sometimes quite profoundly (the bar scene where he stands on the counter), it is not the central theme of the movie.  Finbar hold's his own, if you will.  The viewer is not guided to self-indulge in pity or in lofty admiration for Finbar but rather, to see him as a regular guy who happens to have dwarfism.

Overall I was entranced by the beauty of this film.  It speaks to anyone who has aspired to become a hermit, but underneath, really wishes for companionship.  Sitting on a porch, taking in the fresh air, and sharing a laugh.  These are the moments that friends cherish.  If you give it a chance, this is the film to remind you.",1400630400,,5863,4.491493383742911

He doesn't disappoint in this fine story of a quiet, shy man who just wants to left alone so he can watch and study trains. That's not going to happen due to the people he meets in Newfoundland Pennsylvania; chief among them Joe played by Bobby Cannavale and Olivia played by Patricia Clarkson. They are excellent, especially Cannavale who I think almost steals the movie. However he can't completely steal it because Dinklage displays all of his acting skills in his scenes and he carries the movie. The movie was written and directed by Thomas McCarthy.

Seems to me to comment on our society's alienation of those who are different, but more importantly, makes it so obvious that those who may be different in some way still are human and share the same desires and cares that most of us share.  To be a friend, to need a friend, and to be seen as important in the eyes of others, and to be seen as a whole person who wants to be respected and needed and have those emotions returned, as well.

2038444,4,B0001WTWDI,"This is what I would call a speed-of-life drama. It moves day by day, experience by experience. Are you the audience that wants to see what happens in the lives of four small-town New Jersey residents? Watch on.
One of the major themes explored by the characters - Peter Dinklage as Fin and Patricia Clarkson as Olivia - is how Fin experiences life as a dwarf. His portrayal is fantastic, gifted even; his facial expressions progress with the movie and tell the story at least as well as the dialogue. Moreso, I'm confident in saying.

Our culture needs outsider stories more than ever. Almost all of us are outsiders compared to some fictional ideal. But there's a classic writers' rule - show, don't tell. So when Fin tells about getting treated differently because he's a dwarf, it draws attention to the fact that this movie's entire success DEPENDS on the fact that he is a dwarf So yes, he does. But leave it as a plotline, for Fin, not as a life story for Peter. Strike that line from the record, and it's a great film.",1399507200,,1026,4.516129032258065

2038447,5,B0001WTWDI,"The story of the Station Agent is not overly complicated, and I won't ruin it through exposition here.  I will  recommend the film highly and try to justify the recommendation without spoilers.  If you are really worried about it, just go watch the movie and stop reading now. . . it's the best advice I can give.

Thematically the film deals with isolation from the lives of the people around you for three main characters with divergent reasons for finding themselves removed from the company of others.

Don't expect a thrill a minute, fast paced film, but rather a thoughtful story played out with just as much non-verbal emotional content as well-crafted dialogue.  Peter Dinklage is excellent in a role that, ironically, depends entirely on his physical presence as a little person, but offers him a chance to connect with the viewer as so much more than that.  His talent as an actor is quite apparent from the film (and he was recognized with several award wins and nominations) and I felt that the character of Finn gave some real insight into what it is like for someone four-feet five-inches tall on a daily basis without exploiting that premise in any way (as is often the case in the media).

Patricia Clarkson also offers a superb performance and she is a personal favorite of mine.  Her appearance in several episodes of Frasier and Six Feet Under and her role in the Green Mile are excellent, but in this movie she really gets the screen time that she deserves, and the result is a film with great spirit, some funny moments and a realistic quality that seems unspoiled by larger studio productions' need to end in utter triumph or dismal trajedy.  This film is more of a character study where the progression of the characters is more subtle and relatable.

Please watch this movie.",1399507200,,1799,4.715654952076678
2038448,5,B0001WTWDI,I thought the movie was excellent. It was like looking back at the past. People can be  cruel while others show their love and caring. We all had or have dreams of other things and sometimes learn to share them. Strangers becoming friends.,1399507200,,239,4.558139534883721

2038583,3,B0001WTWDI,"Overall, it was a good use of my time.  Very relaxing movie, well paced, not overly dramatic.  Matter of fact, almost perfect in its simplicity.  Had I known that going in it would have rated higher. But the lack of anything that really happens and then it ends just leaves you wondering what the point was.  Patricia Clarkson was the only reason I watched the film and she did not dissapoint.  Also, all star cast getting thier feet wet was pretty cool to watch.",1398816000,,463,4.464285714285714
2038584,4,B0001WTWDI,If 3 opposites can attract and repel - here they are. What an interesting collection of personalities and troubles. Each character had something important to share with us about life not to mention all we learned about trains! A real treat.,1398816000,,240,4.878048780487805
2038585,4,B0001WTWDI,Good movie. A little strange anti-climatic ending. but good just the same. I would recommend it for a happy day not sad day.,1398816000,,124,4.434782608695652
2038586,5,B0001WTWDI,"Sensitive, psychologically astute film that allows for some thought.  One can extrapolate from the themes presented, but also watch on a purely superficial level and enjoy it immensely.",1398816000,,185,5.607142857142857

I enjoyed nearly everything about the movie, especially Fin's progress toward fully joining in with humanity, despite humanity's largely terrible behavior toward him.  Dinklage is able to convey a world of expression through his eyes.  Clarkson is just brittle enough to express her character's heartbreak.  Cannavale is the guy I wish had been my older brother's best friend, and Goodwin is totally believable as a child who accepts easily what is difficult for adults.  I was also especially glad to find that Newfoundland, New Jersey, is a real place.",1398729600,,627,5.048543689320389

The main character is grumpy and basically rude.  Perhaps this movie gets better the longer you watch it, but it sure lacks interest in the first 15 minutes in my opinion.",1398729600,,332,4.39344262295082

2038610,5,B0001WTWDI,"I appreciated how the three main characters were able to connect with one another, almost against all odds.  Two of the characters were so withdrawn from the world due to their own painful backgrounds and one just wanted friendship and was lonely.

2038613,4,B0001WTWDI,"While there are deeper and perhaps darker ways to treat the themes woven into the film, as they are expressed there is plenty to resonate with.  The prejudice, discrimination and resulting angst suffered by little people is not overblown, yet manages to hold the viewer's interest.  Along with a cast of characters who  have unique personal idiosyncrasies of their own, as well challenging personal issues the film there is lots to engage the viewer.",1398643200,,450,5.054054054054054

2038615,1,B0001WTWDI,They call this a comedy? No. A movie with no plot and it ends with a giant flop. Don't waste your time on this one,1398643200,,114,3.6
2038616,4,B0001WTWDI,I liked this movie. I liked the comraderie that presented itself among these three people who were each into different things and had different interest but they came together and their characters play well off of each other.,1398643200,,225,4.947368421052632

2038643,4,B0001WTWDI,I think if is a very good independent movie. The actors played their characters really well. The movie is combination of drama and comedy and definitely about friendship and companionship.,1398556800,,188,5.3
2038644,4,B0001WTWDI,A well acted and tightly written little film. Nice tempo and some funny moments in this odd drama of discovery.,1398556800,,111,4.6
2038645,4,B0001WTWDI,It was a really different kind of movie than what we're used to. I think it's one of those movies that has a lot of layers and you need to watch it a couple of times.,1398556800,,166,3.638888888888889

2038647,5,B0001WTWDI,"I got lost in the revery of this film and then all of a sudden it was over.  I felt disappointed because I wanted it to continue, to see how the characters faired in the next moment.  Peter Dinklage is terrific in the film - he IS the station agent, though Amazon doesn't even list him under main or supporting characters!  He plays a loner, a person who avoids other people because of the ridicule they typically heap on him for his size.  He hesitantly befriends two other main characters - an artist who is alone, trying to heal from the death of her child, and a garrulous young man who parks his food truck all day at an abandoned train depot in the middle of nowhere.

This is a slow, quiet, deep character study of three decent and caring people who have chosen or are forced by circumstances to live on the fringes of society.  It is also a comment on the isolation and the comradeship that we all experience.  Highly recommended.",1398556800,,938,4.38728323699422
2038648,4,B0001WTWDI,This show kind of plods along. Despite that I couldn't stop watching. There are many good situations that happen in the lives of the 3 main characters. The difficult challenges they face are dealt with positively. The friendship they grow feels good.,1398556800,,250,4.976190476190476

2038661,4,B0001WTWDI,"In the comments offered as you open this video, it is offered as a comedy, but it is a serious presentation of people dealing with the pain of everyday life.  Although it is an excellent movie, I saw nothing funny about the events.  While it is true most of these are comedy actors, the seriousness of the story line creates very moving and deeply emotional involvement among people that would normally never have a meaningful word to speak to each other.",1398556800,,455,4.604938271604938

Not that it picked up a bunch then, it's when you finally started connecting with the characters and enjoy their dynamics.

I think I laughed once during this movie and spent the rest of the movie wondering...where are the funny parts? I would consider this a drama - and a very dry one at that. It has a few redeeming qualities but don't waste your time on it. I have no idea how this got a 7.8 on IMDB. Don't waste your time.",1398297600,3,416,4.024096385542169

2038757,3,B0001WTWDI,I chose to give this movie five stars because of its poignant portrayal of friendships between a woman and two men. It was a sweet and real story of how strangers met and friendships grew.  My husband and I enjoyed it for the second time.,1398124800,,238,4.288888888888889

2038775,4,B0001WTWDI,"I was attracted to this movie by two of my favorites, Peter Dinklage and Patricia Clarkson. The story was simple a man inherits a train depot and goes there to live a quiet life. He is drawn into the lives of a very loud and funny food truck man played perfectly by Bobby Cannavale, a grieving mother played beautifully by Patricia Clarkson and a young librarian played by Michelle Williams. Although he treats all of them with a quiet detachment at first, then gradually comes out of his shell and joins them on their journey through the ups and downs of life.

We did not expect a lot from it when we decided to view it, but it grew on us as we watched.  Most ordinary people can relate to the characters, although I doubt that the upper class, the one-percenters, will have much in common with them.  The actors, whom we had never seen before so far as we know, did a great job, better than we expected.

There is a certain bittersweet tinge to the film, but ultimately it is uplifting.",1397952000,,560,4.407766990291262

The idea was very good and unique. The actors were superb in getting down their parts.  All in all, it did keep me engaged.  But when the story was getting interesting finally, the writers jumped right into typical Hollywood romantic comedy formula (no this isn't a romantic comedy really...but when you watch it...you'll probably get what I mean).

There's little comedy here, outside the fine performance of Bobby Cannavale, who plays an average Joe with more sensitivity than one typically finds in Average Joes). The movie progresses slowly as an emotionally devastated woman (Patricia Clarkson) befriends a dwarf (Peter Dinklage). Dinklage, having spent much of his life harassed, humiliated, or angry at having been born little in a big world, slowly works his way out of his emotional bunker to help Clarkson deal with grief.

Peter Dinklage rocks, as usual (Tyrion Lannister in ""Game of Thrones""). Without spoiling much it can be said that the viewer gets a peek into an intimate story of a lonely man finding friendship in unusual circumstances. I found this movie refreshing, among the shallow blockbuster releases that dominate our cinematography.

2038973,4,B0001WTWDI,"Although the story is brief and uncomplicated, the characters -- in particular, Dinklage's Fin -- are nuanced and engaging. Fin obviously harbors anger over his stature. This anger leads him to shut himself from the world and shun other people. But, little by little, he opens up to two very different individuals -- one a divorcee who recently lost her young child, and the other a dutiful son uprooted from Manhattan. These characters form an unlikely trio, but it maintains believability -- if for no other reason than the sheer improbability of it all (i.e. truth is stranger than fiction).

The movie has it's sorrowful moments. It is difficult not to pity Fin for his self-imposed isolation at times. And the divorcee's anguish over her son's death strikes an emotional chord. But the whole picture still manages to render the audience hopeful.

And despite the fact the movie ends rather quickly, it satisfies all the needs of the sympathetic viewer. There are no cliff hangers or serious unresolved issues. Everything just fades out peacefully.

Good flick. I'd recommend it.",1397260800,,1083,5.039106145251397

Bobby Canavale is charming as the gregarious, confident (and tall) foil to Peter Dinglage's brooding, introverted Finn. This story of ""unlikely friendships"" boasts detailed character development and subtle, nuanced perfomances by the stellar cast. The heavier subject matter is punctuated liberally with intelligent humor and even a few laugh-out-loud moments. The story stayed with me for many years after seeing the film in the theater - and is one I like to re-visit on DVD every few years. It is a ""must see"" for fans of independent films who desire intelligent dialogue and deep character development.

***

This is an independent film.  Not to imply quality, or lack of quality just throwing out a heads up to those who have a preference one way or the other.

That being said, if the phrase independent film does not bring to mind any preconceptions for you, then I highly recommend giving this film a try. I *really* want to hold back from an actual review here, as I feel that this is one of those films that needs to be seen before being too polluted by opinions of others, but Ill go ahead and lay out a few ambiguous personal views anyway:  its entertaining, paced well and has about the best casting I could imagine for the story being told even though the story at its core isn't anything all that original (but jaded happens for anyone who watches too many movies, I suppose).

The only caveat emptor I feel should be mentioned is that (as the tile implies or, might come to imply in a few more words) while not specifically a railroad film, trains do play a role more akin to character than backdrop.  Those who like them will smile, but I don't believe any but die-hard anti-railroad groups will find their inclusion overbearing.",1397174400,,1519,4.5625

In this almost perfect movie (hard to find any fault), Peter Dinklage more than adequately (rather, exceptionally) fills the big shoes of the protaganist, Finbar McBride, bringing into full relief the problems that must be confronted and overcome by anyone who stands out as being different in our society. With great dignity and courage, Finbar walks the right-of-way of our social biases and preconceptions and offers a self-contained, yet strong jaw, to anyone that might doubt his relevance as a whole and feeling human being

But Dinklage is only one third of the dynamic and capable triumverate of actors who together, weld this movie into a seamless and memorable, ensemble production.

Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale both join Mr. Dinklage in wonderful performances, portraying Olivia Harris and Joe Oramas, both of whom, like Finbar, walk the rails of their own personal social integration and acceptance problems.

Of the three, the binding character of the film, Finn, who has just inherited an defunct train station, seems to have his act together and sort of knows what he wants from life, except for the tiny fact that he's a dwarf which continues to interfere with his desire for solitude. The other two characters are a woman painter who's sort of lost as a result of a tragic accident, and a young man that sells coffee and sandwiches from lunch truck parked along side the defunct train station when he's not looking after his sickly father. The three meet and start to form a close friendship of support for each other.  ...Not sure why the movie is called a comedy; I didn't laugh once during the entire movie.",1396742400,,867,4.666666666666667

All he wants is to be left alone but then comes loudmouth Joe, played by Bobby Cannavale  who sets up his fathers food truck in the parking lot of the station. And then comes Olivia, played by Patricia Clarkson, to make the trio of misfits into an ensemble of unforgettable characters, each working out their misfit life, until in the end they realize they are perfect for each other.",1396742400,,637,4.678571428571429

2039269,4,B0001WTWDI,I enjoyed this quirky movie. It is charming and fun peopled with believable but unusual characters I could care about. No gratuitous sex or violence. Watch it before you go to bed for sweet dreams rather than the ones coming from all the crime drama and nightly news. This movie is not without depth or life issues. It's more about character than plot and it is highly recommended.,1396742400,,381,4.617647058823529

2039271,5,B0001WTWDI,"I can't believe it's taken me ten years (the movie came out in 2003!!!) to see this movie! Peter Dinklage (recently of Game of Thrones fame) plays a solitary soul as a result of his dwarfism...he keeps to himself and goes to his secluded job each day with predictable results. He's in control of his existence. He ""ignores"" the jibes he gets from strangers because of his size, so when he inherits a plot of land from his deceased employer that is quite separated from most of humanity, he jumps at the chance to pursue his solitary existence.

Friendships are unexpectedly thrust upon him, and the movie explores the ups and downs of caring, commitment, and self-worth...not only for Finn (Dinklage), but for his new-found friends.

One of my new favorites.",1396656000,,758,4.778625954198473

2039275,3,B0001WTWDI,A pretty good indie film (whatever that means) with some really good acting. Peter Dinklage is typically great in this.

2039323,4,B0001WTWDI,"Slowed paced but found the main character Peter Dinklage (Finn) to be engaging and interesting right from the beginning, and is able to hold my interest through the entire film.  In the film Finn says that he doesn't understand why people are so interested in him, because he is not that smart or interesting.  Actually the opposite is true, he is an intelligent and interesting person, not because of his size, but because that is part of who he is.  That just kind of comes across.

I am glad that Finn was able to over come his challenges and decides to connect rather than continue to try to keep himself isolated from others.

One thing that I found a little unlike real life, people don't usually just walk up and start telling you their past or huge issues right out of the blue.  But for the purposes of this movie, it was okay.

2039345,3,B0001WTWDI,This little guy is weired little station agent and he attracts similar kind and he moves to a new town. Sort of love thing. Only interesting because the agent is so unique among the society. Silent type of guy. I doubt I will see it again but it is ineresting srory and hard to foget.,1396569600,,284,4.181818181818182

2039347,3,B0001WTWDI,If I had it to watch over again I wouldn't but I'm not upset that I wasted my time with it. Mostly I enjoyed watching Bobby Cannavale. I always find him so charming and his character in this movie was so open you couldn't help but love him.,1396483200,,240,4.020833333333333
2039368,5,B0001WTWDI,"it moves slowly and has good character development except for the librarian's relationship with the station agent. Scenes were probably cut that explained further but otherwise, the character arcs were okay but I kept wondering how a man living in a place without water or electric took a bath, brushed his teeth, laundered his clothes, etc. Suspension of reality is difficult in a film structured as character studies in an uninviting environment.",1396483200,,448,5.236111111111111

2039371,3,B0001WTWDI,Not an exciting or funny movie.  Not much plot.  Kept us interested in the developing relationships.  Needed something more yes.,1396396800,,128,5.3

2039375,3,B0001WTWDI,"It's an interesting character study of three people.  They are all either dysfunctional, damaged or limited by family constraints.  Over time they learn how to co-exist together in a more healthy manner.  What I thought was interesting to see was what a 'little person's' daily reality looks like and how painful it can be.  I thought all of the actors did a great job in playing their character and you could feel their pain.  Many of the scenes with very little dialogue were the most painful to watch because the characters were stuck with their own reality and you could tell it was crushing them.  When they finally are able to accept one another for what they are, push themselves beyond the boundaries that are stifling their growth a peaceful truce is reached.  I enjoyed the movie.",1396396800,,790,4.7226277372262775

2039388,3,B0001WTWDI,entertaining and interesting but a little slow at times. The characters were diverse and interesting which made the movie worth the watch,1396396800,,137,5.2727272727272725
2039389,5,B0001WTWDI,This was a very interesting movie as seen through the eyes of a dwarf. Most of us seldom experience life in this way. Good acting all around.,1396396800,,141,4.2592592592592595
2039390,4,B0001WTWDI,"This is a very rewarding movie. It gives a character portrait of a dwarf without being preachy. (The actor playing the dwarf went on to fame in ""Game of Thrones"".) The setting, a small town in New Jersey, has real weight, the houses and the bar and the railroad memorable, and the actors, many of them quite well known, inhabit their roles. No one is a stereotype. The plot meanders, which is better than if it were about someone who had fallen, dusted himself off, and triumphed. The movie doesn't try to accomplish too much, and so accomplishes a lot. I particularly liked the hot dog cart because it was so shabby that it reminded me of places I have been or passed up. This is what Hollywood does so well when it foregoes a big budget and focuses on visualizing a story and an atmosphere.",1396396800,,792,4.431506849315069
2039391,5,B0001WTWDI,"Very nice and realistic. That reality suffered by those minorities who suffer exclusion from the standardized roles for the majority of society. Excellent conclusion that meets the acceptance of three different status, without proposing solutions and especially refraining from judgments.

2039397,1,B0001WTWDI,"To say this movie moved slowly would be a disservice to the term.  Snails and turtles are light speed compared to this cinematic disaster.  To even begin to say there is a story revolving around this film is a stretch as the dialogue is so empty and rudderless.  The only suspense in this movie comes in wondering when it will (God willing) end.  We spent 2 nights watching this movie (could not get through it on one) and came away feeling like we had been completely taken.  Those who are rating this film highly have to be on the production staff.

If you are mad at someone, recommend they watch this movie.  You will more than get back at them...",1396396800,,651,4.375

2039423,2,B0001WTWDI,The description said it was a comedy.  I didn't think there was anything funny in it .  It was sad,1396396800,,98,3.85

He found something more important in the end...friendship. Ever since seeing him (Peter Dinklage) on Elf and now on Game of Thrones, I've realized that he is a really great actor and seems to be able to play any part. I think anyone would enjoy this movie.",1396310400,,423,4.578947368421052

2039440,5,B0001WTWDI,Superb movie that should be watched with family.  The movie teaches all that it is what is in ones heart what counts.  It is not ones size that we should be concerned with.  True honest giving frienship is special as it creates a magnificent bond that can help overcame many challenges.  Enjoyment at times can came from the simplicity of being true to one self.  It is not what we accumulate what makes us successful rather is those we have the pribiledge of calling friends.  The movie in its simplicity explores simple humanity interaction and enjoyment.,1396310400,,557,4.75

I really wanted to give this movie five stars but the ending was just so abrupt that it's all I can think about.

2039476,4,B0001WTWDI,"But fun, overall.

Excellent casting of actors for particular roles here and an array of emotions are felt by the viewer. Very amusing in some manners and equally sad - regarding the truth of human nature, too.

It was incredibly introspective and although you will not find but one scene that moves very quickly, the feeling for these folks is gripping. It kept my interest through out.

Basically the story of a young man wanting to live a life of solitude when his friend and boss dies and leaves him an old railroad station and some land in a small quiet town.  After arriving he meets and reluctantly becomes friends with a small but very different group of people, including a woman in mourning who is separated from her husband, a young man (very friendly and surprisingly sweet) who runs a food truck that sets up beside the station, a very young girl and a pregnant librarian.  Touching, smart, surprising.  I want to be their friend and genuinely wish to see them succeed.  We see their highs and their lows.  I recommended this movie to my friends, and family.  No big star names, No violence, no nudity, nothing offensive, almost a rarity these days.  (And my movie genre is usually horror/suspense)",1396137600,,937,4.658536585365853

2039561,5,B0001WTWDI,"Some singers are said to be so talented that they could sing the phonebook and the audience would be mesmerized.  As our screen gem begins we are treated to the exact opposite in which the excitement of a massive billowing steam engine piercing the mountain tunnel is demonstrably rendered less interesting than that of watching Jell-O gel. And we are instantly mesmerized.  Every once in a very rare while a film is birthed onto the internet that while a box office failure ten years ago seems today timeless in its spirit and quirky enough to seem almost real.  In those intersections of the uncomfortable embarrassment of self recognition and the sad enormity of the average life playing out its boring self is the hope that lays silent and buried in every human that you do, in fact, matter in spite of your attempts to pretend you dont.  Such is the world of The Station Agent which is cinema speak for Small Stones Make Big Ripples.
Some movies have heart; this film has a heart, a soul and a mind and a style that reminds me of a calm surface on a giant sea as the flotsam begins rotating imperceptibly at first and then picks up speed until it becomes a whorl sucking everything into its reality and there you find yourself facing the Kraken of your existence all while smiling.
There is no real way to describe this movie because theres no way a movie about guys who like trains is really about guys who like trains.  Youll have to determine for yourself what this movie is.

We thoroughly enjoyed it, admit that at first it was a bit sluggish - but the pace works in the long run.
Characters are indeed characters and I really appreciated the entire movie. Not a dud in the bunch - hope to see more of the star, he's darn good and not at all hard on the eyes.  It just was a movie that made me feel - think - laugh - and yes, a few tears rolled. This ensemble was so well layered and quirky - people are quirky and if they deny it, run.
Differences are necessary to make this world turn and until we all learn to coexist with some sort of acceptance of each other, the whole ball is going to fall flat.

His co-stars are as quirky as he is and it makes for a fun and interesting film, not your typical fare from Hollywood. The director and screen writer did an excellent job with the characters keeping the viewer wondering where  this is going. There are several obvious flaws too. For example, one character is a hot dog vendor whose truck is kept at the abandoned station. Why there? Who knows. There are no customers except for the other co-star and a couple of losers who stop by once. Yet the man seems to have plenty of money, can't figure out how he really makes a living, but who cares, the film is fun anyway.",1395878400,,785,4.376712328767123

Laying it out here, it doesn't seem to add up. And on the screen it doesn't seem to add up either, except it really does. That that makes for a strange little movie. Not the best I've ever seen, not even in the top 20. But way far from the worst. Strangely intriguing and attractive yet not 100% satisfying.",1395705600,,664,4.732758620689655

The movie showed how they each filled a gap and provided support to one another, how their relationships were tried through trials, but how they came together again.  The young man reached out to both the dwarf and then to the woman to establish an unlikely friendship that survived the test.  The woman then reached out to the dwarf.  After parting ways, it was the dwarf who reached out to the woman in her need and then to the man who responded to the request to help the woman.

2039755,5,B0001WTWDI,"I think Hollywood is underestimating the American public by not utilizing the talents of Peter Dinklage. He has talent, good looks and a voice that seems to resonate in your torso.
Yes, I loved this film and I loved everyone in it. It was a fortunate accident that I watched it as I had the misunderstanding that it was a British movie, which I would usually pick over an American movie. British films are usually a sure-thing for me whereas great American films are a little sparse.
Patricia Clarkson: Never saw her on TV but have enjoyed her performance in every movie I've seen her in. You can read what's going on in her face when she is not speaking. You can turn down the volume while watching this movie and you would still understand everything that is going on.
Bobby Cannavale: Everything, I've enjoyed everything I have ever seen him in. He's a feel-good actor, often reminding you of that great buddy you always enjoy being around. I haven't seen him in the two television shows listed in his credits but I can see him in a good Ephron-style romance. He has leading-man qualities I haven't seen utilized, yet.
Every non-principal character was very natural and believable on screen. No one was ""acting.""
But, Mr. Dinklage ... I want to see him in leading roles on the screen and I would pay handsomely to catch him on stage. He has Shakespearian qualities and what you see in his eyes and hear in that resonant voice ... he's quality and should be handed quality scripts.
All that said, you need to be in the right mood to view this film. It's slightly ""Baghdad-Cafe""-artsy. It has that warm independent film feel. Those who have ever lived in small towns might appreciate the familiarity of the town's residents. We all know someone like every person in this movie.

Superbly understated acting by Peter Dinklage and Patricia Clarkson provided the perfect foil for Bobby Cannavale's outsize personality to round out this oddly derived trio.

I went to rate it, saw all the rave reviews, noticed that it won at the Sundance Film Festival, and decided to give it another chance. Trying to watch this movie was like trying to snorkle through a trough of crap with a one-inch hose. It must have been a painfully disappointing festival for this film to win. I went back to ""most popular"" on Amazon Prime, and noticed that Pee Wee's Big Adventure is near the top of the list when sorting by ""most popular."" Good grief, Charlie Brown!

2039839,5,B0001WTWDI,"Finnbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a dwarf who is willed an abandoned railroad station in tiny Newfoundland, New Jersey by his late boss. Having endured countless taunts because of his stature, Finn wants nothing more than to live out his life as a hermit in this isolated location in the hills of rural northern New Jersey, where he can indulge his passion for trains. However, such is not to be. He has barely arrived when he encounters Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), a recently-separated woman who is still grieving over the son she lost a couple years earlier and who, as an artist, has immersed herself in her painting to cover up the hurt. Although Finn tries hard to stay by himself, Olivia doesn't let this happen. Neither does Joe (Bobby Cannavale), the hot-dog vendor who sets up shop every day just outside the station. Little by little, these three, despite their different interests, become entwined with each other. Through this, each of these three people grow in self-awareness and character. This is definitely a movie worth watching.",1395446400,,1049,4.965909090909091

2039843,4,B0001WTWDI,"Regardless of  how independent we want to be or how stoic we want to appear we all need someone in our lives to just be there. Through happenstance the three characters find their lives becoming intertwined as each one was missing the integrity of true friendship/relationship (and not in a sexual way). It is the small things, showing kindness, small gifts, a listening ear, without judgement, that impacts others lives. One does not end the movie with hands raised and shouting, ""Yes,"" but with a much more reflective, ""they needed each other.""
Definitely worth the four stars as the characters were so relatable as many are a reflection of those in our own lives - the good, the bad, and the ugly.

That is not to be, however, as Joe (managing a food truck yards away from the depot), and Olivia, with major heartbreak having lost her son, barge into his life, giving all three an odd, but fulfilling friendship.  This film manages to build these characters into people you care about and want to see together.

It could be the very strong acting, and also knowing the back story about how the van, the house, the paintings were borrowed, and how a school was converted to look like a waiting room of a hospital. In other words it is one of those great films on a tight budget that was obviously a labor of love for everyone involved. I told one of my friend to watch it, and to this day she cannot understand the appeal it has for me. I explained it has no deep and profound meaning other than maybe that no man is an island.

2040116,5,B0001WTWDI,"Here's a brief quiz to help you decide whether this movie will be to your liking:
Which Jim Carrey movie appeals to you more: Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls or Man on the Moon?
If you prefer Ace Ventura and never even heard of Man on the Moon (biopic about quirky comedian Andy Kaufman), then The Station Agent is probably not your style. That's a generalization, of course, but some of the reviews I've read about The Station Agent have been unfairly negative based seemingly on the viewers' expectations. If you go into it looking for a quiet, in depth character study about human beings trying to find where they fit in the world, you have come to the right place. But viewers looking for fart jokes will be bitterly disappointed. (note: Jim Carrey is not in this movie, but those 2 disparate films in his repertoire seemed an apt comparison to the differing comedic styles.)

There are enough plot synopses around that other reviewers have done better than I could, so I won't put you through reading yet another. Suffice it to say that if you are ready to snuggle up for the evening and watch 3 people muddle through the awkward beginnings of friendship, saddled with their past experiences and heartaches, this movie will reward you with great performances and an honest, clear-eyed view of their lives.",1395100800,,1309,4.716157205240175
2040117,2,B0001WTWDI,Slow moving. Too many questions. Who bought anything at the hot dog stand on that deserted road?  How did Finn support himself without his job?  Did he ever get electric it water?  Why would anyone take such abuse from Finn and still try to he his friend ?  He was an angry person which could be understandable yet I know many disabled people who don't take their anger out on the world.  Seemed like the plot jumped around too much. Undeveloped characters like the library girl. What was the purpose of even having her in the story?  The most like able believable people were the hot dog stand man and the little black girl.,1395100800,,625,4.43859649122807

2040119,5,B0001WTWDI,"Although I had watched the movie previously a few years ago, I decided to watch it again recently.  I liked it even more the second time around.  The movie, about a dwarf who has only one person he can call a friend, inherits an abandoned railroad station house and soon finds himself surrounded by people drawn to him first out of curiousity, then by something deeper.  The main character, Fin, finds his life changing, at first, against his will, then by choice.  Viewers are pulled along for the ride, mesmerized by the timing, not too fast, not too slow.

His life is routine, comfortable, predictable and yet vaguely empty.  The inheritance of a half acre with a caboose, a passenger train car and a train station look more like a refuge from the loss of his work companion-friend than a move in his life.  His being a dwarf is not a big issue except when confronted by ignorance and macho immaturity.  The inanity and pain of living is clear from his two new found companions.  But it goes nowhere. There is no resolution, just more clarity as to their pain. They are left rocking on a porch overlooking a lake, each in their own isolation.

The setting (small town in New Jersey in late Spring?) felt like I could step into it, it felt that realistic . The characters were like you and me and people you'd encounter in real life as opposed to what movies and T.V. usually presents. There is a place of course for the usual run of the mill movie idea of people and relationships and then there is something better. This movie is the latter.
The friendships developed naturally albeit begrudgingly and I'm glad that they did so. I was cheering inwardly for these characters to become friends. Their friendships took some rough turns and there were moments when I thought tragedy would strike.

In this movie, you get a growing friendship between three people, each of whom are in a lonely situation for different reasons.  This is a good movie to watch to grow as a person because you grow in your understanding of the pain and loneliness of a person, one who grows up and stays at home to take care of his father, a second who survives the death of a young child and subsequent, related divorce, and a third who is a dwarf.  The movie is sweet in many ways.

After the shop owner drops from a heart attack Finn inherits an old abandoned railroad agent building in rural New Jersey. It is there that he meets colorful characters each with their own unique flaws. You learn that it is tough being a dwarf in a tall world.

The pace of the movie seemed to match the characters, a lot of friends just being together and not really feeling like they had to ""do"" something.

2040197,5,B0001WTWDI,"This is one of those movies I was surprised to find myself watching, not my typical weekend flick...more on the serious side with a dash of humor tossed in. But it was very good and I couldn't stop watching. Starts slow, not a ton of dialog, more emotion through motion. Worth watching.",1394841600,,286,4.519230769230769
2040198,5,B0001WTWDI,"This is a wonderful movie. I watch it every couple of years, always finding some little gem of movement or expression previously missed.",1394841600,,136,4.956521739130435
2040199,4,B0001WTWDI,"I normally don't watch movies that may be depressing or that have uncomfortable subject matter.  Many times a movie will be described as a comedy and turn out to be anything but.  The Station Agent was a perfect balance of comedy and drama though, and I enjoyed it very much!  Thoughtfully written and acted from start to finish, you won't be disappointed in this satisfying, delightful story which left me with a smile on my face and warmth in my heart.",1394841600,,454,4.580246913580247
2040200,4,B0001WTWDI,The most enjoyable aspect of this film is the portrayal of how we approach other humans that are different and what that speaks about our own character.  Fin did a stunning job of dealing with the variety of people he encounters.,1394841600,,229,4.585365853658536

2040202,4,B0001WTWDI,I liked the overall story. a little slow moving at times. It is a movie that makes you think about how people are judged,1394755200,,120,4.041666666666667
2040203,4,B0001WTWDI,Sweet and touching. I enjoyed the development of all three characters during the movie. Also I never realized that train chasing was an activity! All round lovely movie about friendship.,1394755200,,186,5.233333333333333
2040214,4,B0001WTWDI,"Different storyline, that is why I said ""peculiar"", lot of hard work at the start to get characters interacting, not much resolution at the end, just slice of life but you do get to care about some of the people in it.",1394755200,,218,4.214285714285714
2040215,1,B0001WTWDI,"Really the strangest movie I have ever watched. Think I must have blanked out or went to sleep because something, no, a lot was missing in this movie. Served no purpose but to waste precious time. Really time I can never get back!",1394755200,,230,4.372093023255814
2040216,5,B0001WTWDI,This is a great film. Three unlikely people cross paths.  Great acting. Keeps your attention the whole time. Highly recommended.,1394755200,,128,5.4

2040218,4,B0001WTWDI,"The cover picture gave me no hint as to how I might enjoy this movie but I took a chance and am glad I did.  Three very different characters pulled me into the story and held me there.

Makes me want to go find a trestle somewhere and sit back.  That's all - just sitting back.",1394668800,,277,3.9107142857142856

2040220,4,B0001WTWDI,"genuine people with genuine issues. funny, heartfelt. Contrasting personalities that are put in the same environment and find strong threads of friendship to pull them through their issues.",1394668800,,189,5.785714285714286
2040221,3,B0001WTWDI,"They made a mundane movie about nothing other than ordinary life in a small town, but somehow it's good, and people can relate to it.",1394668800,,133,4.36
2040222,5,B0001WTWDI,Love the way this movie moves through the plot to get how misfits get to be friends. It is a fun movie to watch.,1394582400,,112,3.7083333333333335
2040223,5,B0001WTWDI,"This was a movie that grows on you.  It is very Indie, or quiet in style.  There is a lot of NO talking.  The actors actually act.  Very good vibes even though no-so-nice events happen.  I knew nothing about it going into it, and was totally sucked inside.  Very neat.",1394582400,,268,4.26
2040242,3,B0001WTWDI,It was a charming movie.  Slow awkward start to the movie which then turned into a lovely movie about the human condition.  Loved Joe!,1394582400,,134,4.541666666666667
2040243,4,B0001WTWDI,"It was a nice surprise. Somewhat unusual topic, funny and sad at the same time.
We liked it and recommend it to anyone who wants something different from the usual Hollywood movie.",1394582400,,180,4.65625
2040244,2,B0001WTWDI,I was watching with 2 other people and we turned it off after 20 minutes. A surprise given the favorable reviews.,1394582400,,113,4.428571428571429
2040245,3,B0001WTWDI,"Just a look into the lives of these ordinary people. No excitement, no interesting plot, no fun or funny dialogue. Just a nice little independent film. I was not bored at any time and kind of enjoyed the film.",1394582400,,209,4.384615384615385
2040246,2,B0001WTWDI,The movie moved slowly and did not hold my attention.  The acting was excellent but I bailed out at about the half way point.  I was bored.,1394582400,,139,4.111111111111111
2040247,3,B0001WTWDI,"This movie shows the struggles of someone outcast by society because of who they are. In this case, a dwarf man moving to a new town.",1394582400,,133,4.153846153846154
2040248,5,B0001WTWDI,Great movie.  No bells and whistles just interesting characters and human emotion.  Will make you laugh and cry. Beautiful scenery too.,1394582400,,135,5.380952380952381
2040249,5,B0001WTWDI,I watched because it looked interesting. I am very happy that I did. IO would recommend this to any one over? 18 or so. The few words that may bother some are what you hear every day and is what makes the movie so great.,1394582400,,220,3.911111111111111
2040250,3,B0001WTWDI,I watched this movie due to the high ranking but this was about a bunch of losers learning to get along with each other and no one else.,1394582400,,136,3.892857142857143
2040251,5,B0001WTWDI,"What a delight! I discovered this while browsing, never heard of it before but judging from the other reviews it looked good. Boy, what a surprise! In spite of its obvious low-budget origins, everything about this movie is top-notch. The acting is good, the story is good, the characters are 3 dimensional and top it off that it's a ""feel good movie"". I was left thinking about it for a very long time afterward and recommended it to friends. I only give 5 stars to movies I love enough to see again and this is one of them.",1394582400,,524,4.357142857142857
2040272,5,B0001WTWDI,Great characters and a refreshing story line. I love quirky films like this one. Patricia Clarkson is always great. Try it!,1394582400,,123,4.904761904761905
2040273,3,B0001WTWDI,This is an odd little film. The actors were very good . Peter Dinklage is a very good actor his affect throughout the movie was amazing. I am sure he didn't smile once.,1394582400,,168,4.121212121212121
2040274,3,B0001WTWDI,It took a bit of time to get into the movie but it was interesting to see the characters develop.,1394582400,,97,3.9
2040275,5,B0001WTWDI,I enjoyed the acting.  The three characters drew you in to their lives.  Just an enjoyable movie for the family.,1394582400,,112,4.55
2040276,4,B0001WTWDI,"Great character study for all three principle actors. Subtle humor very effective in contrast to sadness and loneliness felt among these people. I especially liked the way Fin ever so gradually began to open up to the possibility of friendship with the most unlikely of prospects.
Recommend this movie to all ages",1394582400,,313,5.038461538461538
2040277,2,B0001WTWDI,"This was a slow movie that didn't give enough background about the characters. I thought it was also listed under comedy, it is not a comedy",1394582400,,140,4.423076923076923
2040278,4,B0001WTWDI,"Wonderful observation on the dynamics of friendships. They can appear when least expected, and end the same way. Worth a view.",1394582400,,126,5.0476190476190474

2040280,5,B0001WTWDI,"Different, moving and well acted. I really liked it and will probably watch it again.  I very highly recommend it.",1394496000,,114,4.7
2040281,2,B0001WTWDI,"Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible movie but it went nowhere. I imagine the writer had in mind a story about how 3 different people from 3 different backgrounds could become friends. The story shows that very well. But friends at what?

Three interesting characters are put before you and they become friends with the up's and down's friends have. The problem is there is nothing for these friends to do as in accomplish. You sit there and watch three friends get on with, well, being friends.",1394496000,,498,4.595505617977528
2040292,4,B0001WTWDI,"I love Patricia Clarkson as an actor; she never fails to deliver. Peter Dinklage was incredible, and Cannavale was surprisingly spot-on for his role - although why he is the only listed actor for the movie is a complete mystery. I looked at a lot of reviews and it appears that you will view this movie in relationship to your own life; in other words, you cannot help but project yourself into it and experience it as if it were first-hand. (For instance, some thought the movie mean and some thought it warm and gentle - same movie...) This is one mark of a great movie. Also it is a ""I never thought about that"" movie in many ways. It is slow-paced but never drags; understated but never obscure. It is a snippet from the lives of some very unique characters; however there is no final resolution to the relationships.
Comment on reviews: Amazon usually does an OK job of a capsulized review to qualify the films a little for you. This was one of their worst efforts - I watch on Roku and a review precedes the film - there was NO review, no hint of the subject, tone, setting or anything - they simply listed the actors... completely not helpful; thanks to all the other reviewers for trumping Amazon's attempt.",1394496000,,1215,4.4774774774774775
2040293,1,B0001WTWDI,Simply depressing and most boring movie i have ever seen. I will not recommend it ever to anyone. Simply Ridiculous,1394409600,2,115,4.8
2040294,5,B0001WTWDI,"This is one of my favorite movies. The characters are deeply developed, causing you to fall in love with each of their lonely, quirky selves.",1394409600,,141,4.68
2040295,4,B0001WTWDI,"I liked this movie when I seen it on IFC, and still do.  It has a good cast and some funny moments in it along with a little drama, but over all I think its a good movie.",1394409600,,170,3.473684210526316
2040296,4,B0001WTWDI,"Watched this because I think Peter Dinklage is so enjoyable in Game of Thrones, and the other characters in this ultimately stole our hearts.  Fell in love with Bobby Cannavale's character, laughed but felt deep empathy for him.  Patricia Clarkson is always someone interesting to be around.  Enjoyed seeing the Finn character go from flat to engaged in life and the company of good friends.  Nice little surprise of a movie.",1394409600,,425,4.943661971830986
2040297,1,B0001WTWDI,I must admit I escaped out of this movie after the first 10 minutes. It failed to capture my attention for it lacked interest. Just seemed like a nonsensical diatribe of chit chat.,1394409600,,180,4.484848484848484
2040298,4,B0001WTWDI,It was a conforting movie and showed the many problems a short person has in this society.  Friendships is a great thing today!,1394409600,,127,4.521739130434782
2040299,5,B0001WTWDI,Really was a great movie.  A very interesting and entertaining story with great acting.  I highly recommend the movie to anyone wanting to enjoy a not well known picture.,1394409600,,170,4.827586206896552
2040300,4,B0001WTWDI,Liked this movie a lot. Would watch it again. It was uplifting bit also very sad. A good mature audience movie.,1394409600,,111,4.333333333333333
2040301,5,B0001WTWDI,The main character finds that there are many people who will see past his exterior and really like the person within.,1394323200,,117,4.619047619047619
2040312,2,B0001WTWDI,This was too slow moving for my tastes. The character development took quite a while and the plot... well slow. It just wasn't for me.,1394323200,,134,4.4
2040313,2,B0001WTWDI,"Slow moving
fair character study only merit for this movie..made it to the end but barely..take a chance if you wish.",1394323200,,117,4.619047619047619
2040314,3,B0001WTWDI,Not funny at all. Pretty depressing. People were not very nice to each other. But I sort of enjoyed it.,1394323200,2,103,4.2
2040315,5,B0001WTWDI,"This was a wonderful movie about 3 people who lived nearly like hermits, and didn't want to be bothered by others, who found out that being happy meant being bothered by others...",1394236800,,179,4.625
2040316,4,B0001WTWDI,I was eventually hooked as I saw a seemingly predictable movie that turned into a delight.  The movie is great to see while sitting next to a friend.,1394236800,,149,4.321428571428571
2040317,5,B0001WTWDI,"I really liked this movie, it was a real movie, seams the director was very humanistic with his characters. They seemed like someone you knew, very realistic. Great Movie!",1394236800,,171,4.931034482758621
2040318,5,B0001WTWDI,"This is a film worth seeing more than once.  This is my second or third time since it came out 11years ago!  It just hits me in the solar plexus for the unique interplay of characters.  Joe is endearing,  The is so heart-rending and endearing you just have to love that li'l guy!  And the Lady won my heart for her zaniness and candor.  Tough all three are survivors and more than survivors~ Overcomers in world that sometimes seems cruel who grew up feeling estranged from is for other reasons!  Reminds me of that old Tex Ritter Song, ""Froggy went a Courting""!  Just lookin' fer a home, just lookin' for a home!",1394236800,,613,4.410714285714286
2040319,5,B0001WTWDI,It was a good story.. it kept my interest through the whole heart warming story about many interesting friendly relationship s,1394236800,,126,5.0476190476190474
2040320,4,B0001WTWDI,Each character faces a different life challenge. Great movie! Plenty of laughs with other emotions mixed in. Worth the watch for sure!,1394236800,,134,5.136363636363637
2040321,4,B0001WTWDI,"I liked this movie enough to recommend it to friends and family.  It's a great movie to lose yourself in for a few hours without the commitment of a heavy plot, confusing characters or violence.

If I walked into a room on a Sunday afternoon and this was playing, I would sit down and watch it again. It's that kind of film.

This is one of those rare films about ordinary life, ordinary struggles, ordinary messy friendships, but also fun, quirky and engaging. I'm glad to see it here on Prime. I will probably watch it again this week.",1394236800,,537,4.404040404040404

2040333,2,B0001WTWDI,"Quirky, relationship movie with little substance other than the dwarf dealing with his lot in life, and two secondary characters dealing with their lives.",1394236800,,154,5.458333333333333
2040334,5,B0001WTWDI,"I won't add to the reviews detailing the plot but will say that this film is a quiet, quirky slice of life for each character. It is such a satisfying depiction of what friendship and common interests can bring. It reminds me of films that were successful in the age before action flicks took over the screen; good story, good casting and good message.  Highly recommended.",1394150400,,373,4.651515151515151
2040335,4,B0001WTWDI,Kept my interest. Very enjoyable story line and good acting. I would highly recommend to everyone and all age groups,1394150400,,116,4.85

2040337,3,B0001WTWDI,"Going to side with another reviewer on its a pointless flick. Slow moving and developing movie about a male dwarf. Tells of how life is tough for him, but also shows how life isn't all its cracked up to be for ""regular folks"". Watch and forget. 2.5 stars.",1394064000,,255,4.333333333333333
2040338,2,B0001WTWDI,"The wife and I watched it, and agreed...how the heck did this have such good ratings, it was not a good movie.  Its the kind of movie that hipster film fest folks love because of some bull crap.",1394064000,,194,4.105263157894737
2040339,4,B0001WTWDI,I enjoyed the great performance.  They felt like real people not over blown egos I wanted to keep following them. It would have made a good series,1394064000,,146,4.407407407407407
2040340,4,B0001WTWDI,"This is a quirky and unique movie, but one that I enjoyed. The acting is solid, and the cinematography is great. The plot is unusual and refreshing. And it makes a social statement against stereotypes of dwarfs.",1394064000,,211,4.72972972972973
2040341,1,B0001WTWDI,"This movie was a total waste of time. No plot, weak acting, weird ending. I would not recommend to anyone. Pull this one off",1394064000,2,124,4.208333333333333
2040352,5,B0001WTWDI,I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie.  My girlfriend tells me that I'm terrible at picking out movies to watch.  Not this time.  I finally picked a winner!,1394064000,,164,4.586206896551724

2040354,4,B0001WTWDI,"I love just about any movie with Patrician Clarkson in it. She just has a way about here that just draws you into her character and into the story.
This is a character based story and is character driven more then plot driven.
My only pet peeve with this movie and a lot of independent films like it is that there is no close to the movie. These movies leave you a bit unsatisfied with their open ending.
But I really enjoyed hanging with the three main characters b/c you almost felt like you were there with them. They break through the fourth wall.",1393977600,,551,4.3076923076923075

2040359,5,B0001WTWDI,This film about a friendship that develops between three lonely people (actually four if you count the little girl or five if you count the librarian too) is just so pitch perfect. I've watch it many times and in spite of the pain some of them are going through it is a story of hope and the joy of letting other people into your life. It also makes me want to move into an old train station too.,1393891200,2,396,4.089743589743589

2040372,5,B0001WTWDI,"One of my all-time favorites.  An awesome character-driven film with the great Peter Dinklage and a host of other wonderful actors.  The story is moving and surprising and the characters, even minor ones, are fully realized.

If you're all about action, this might be too slow for you but, if you like dialogue and human interaction then you'll love this film.",1392768000,,360,4.868852459016393

2040375,5,B0001WTWDI,"This one will steal your heart.  A simple look at life from three non-mainstream characters, all with crosses to bear like the rest of us.  They match up and, like a good Hemingway book, follow a plot that develops because of who they are.  Watch it more than once!

He moves into an abandoned train station, ready to spend the rest of his life alone, but slowly forms friendships with a grieving woman (Patricia Clarkson), an outgoing hot dog man (Bobby Cannavale), and a young librarian (Michelle Williams).

What a wonderful movie this is! The story is heartwarming and the strong cast is excellent in well-developed roles. Fin's evolution from morose loner to affable pal is realistic and touching and I enjoyed every bit of his journey (except for the unnecessary profanity, for which I deleted one star).

Highly recommended for those who enjoy character-driven, quirky indie films, for train fans, and for  anyone who has ever felt completely alone and hopeless.",1383955200,,821,5.066666666666666

2040401,5,B0001WTWDI,"My gf turned me on to this indie gem from 2003 recently so i'm writing this review to hopefully pay that gift forward!  Peter Dinklage is engaging in his performance of Fin, a man stinging from an apparent lifetime of teasing and bullying, although the majority of his responses amount to monosyllabic utterances.  On the other hand, Bobby Cannavale's character, Joe, is a motormouth Puerto Rican who requires the constant companionship of Fin to take his mind off his ailing father.  The two meet and befriend Clarkson's character who carries some deep pain of her own.  Some of the most beautiful moments of the film occur as the three friends try to balance passions and pain with the desire to connect with other people, although not everyone moves at the same pace...

Give this film a shot.  It's well worth the few bucks.",1383264000,,828,4.755244755244755

When his friend and train shop owner dies, he's out of a job, but he does inherit a home in the form of an old train station in rural New Jersey.  Used to being taunted for being different, he has shut himself off from the world and adopted a taciturn demeanor.  His life is about to change, however.  Fin may go there resisting, but friendship and human connection are powerful things, and soon he's swept along.  Superb acting all around.",1381795200,,493,4.49438202247191

2040420,4,B0001WTWDI,"This was a very sweet movie. I recommend this if you like a slow and deliberate character development arc. Not a lot happens and it starts very slow, but the slow and steady increase in complexity with Finn meeting his new neighbors and then developing relationships with them is satisfying and uncrowded. The relaxed pace gives your mind space to appreciate Finn's perspective - slow, simple, deliberate, full of heart, disenfranchised, dignified if not a bit aloof. It helps you break through your own discriminations to see the world through Finn's discerning eyes. It's almost as if the slow development of the plot line gives you time to appreciate the nuances of the ""right of way"" which is really a good metaphor for the inherent human dignity which Finn fights for throughout. Lovely movie...beautiful rich set pieces",1376956800,,825,5.029197080291971

We grow weary of the synopsis writers tagging something a comedy that is not. There were some wry moments but it was really an examination of two damaged introverts and one extrovert. And the ending felt as though the screenwriter had reached the maximum number of pages for a full length film and stopped.

Written and produced with its three principal actors in mind, The Station Agent tells a universal tale of everyday discrimination and everyday feelings surrounding a disused station and its new owner. Told with integrity and wit you fall in love with the characters and their rleationships and really don't want the story to end.

Peter Dinklage is superb as are his cohorts. Watch out also for the quirky and very original musical score.

Horror, especially, is the genre in which I will watch almost anything.  Have seen the ""Alien"" series countless times and worship ""The Walking Dead.""  So, for me to watch an Indie film which is entirely dialogue and character building, that is a rarity.

The first time I saw ""The Station Agent,"" shockingly and surprisingly, I liked it.  A lot.

By the end of the 2nd time I watched, it was literally in my top 10 films of all time.

The story is sweet, the dialogue, although slow -- it's meant to be slow -- is funny, and the characters absolutely adorable.  All three of them.

What is truly special about this film is how they each are going through their sh*t in their lives, and yet their mutual friendships are both comforting and real.

2040533,5,B0001WTWDI,"'The Station Agent ' is the kind of superb film you want to share with everyone! It is a slow feel good film with no real direction nor any real ending.

Fin, a four foot five inch small person, played by Peter Dinklage, has inherited an outpost dilapidated train Agent's Station in the wilds of New Jersey. This is a small desolate town, and the train station is right up Fin's alley. He is a man turned into himself, it appears after much teasing and bullying as a child and as an adult, he prefers time to himself. He has turned into a loner for self preservation.  He finds this agent station fits him well. And, then, comes along Joe, played by Bobby Cannavale, a high strung, talkative, Cuban who is running his dad's food truck. He parks the truck near Fin's new home, so coffee is readily available.  Fin is run into, literally, by Olivia, played by Patricia Clarkson.. She is an artist, mourning her lost marriage and her dead son. These three people come together, unusual friends, but each of them have a need that the other seems to fill. Fast friends they become after several stops and go. Chole, a young black girl is attracted to Fin, and he feels comfortable with her. Fin takes daily walks to learn about the town and to follow the trains, his obsession. Soon, his friends are walking with him. Through trials and tribulations, this film fills a need within all of us. The acting is superb, the filming lovely and the storyline, so important in this day and age of estrangement from each other.

Highly Recommended. Walk don't run to see this film.  prisrob 09-07-12

Of course you do! The man who threw that challenge in the movie ""Elf,"" is Peter Dinklage, and in ""The Station Agent,"" he takes center stage. The story might be quite obvious, yet in the end, there is dignity, respect, and happy tears.

Fin is a simple man, he's undersized, and quite frankly, he lives his own life, without a lot of outsiders invading it. When his best friend and boss/co-worker suddenly passes away, Fin is given a gift.

You see, Fin does have a passion for trains, and his buddy gives him a train station that is in the middle of nowhere. That's perfect, because that means no company whatsoever, no people, no distractions, just Fin and himself. Right? Well, um, not exactly. Fin soon discovers that he has the most unexpected company that he couldn't possibly want to deal with! This was supposed to be his quiet time, and he's being disturbed with all these stupid people! Or are they stupid people? Fin soon discovers, despite his insecurity and vulnerability towards the rest of the human race, that there are people out there who have their hurts and challenges in life as well.

This is so incredible, yet it is so simple. Have we forgotten how to treat people? Some of us have, and it really pisses me off sometimes! We treat people like garbage when they don't fit our standards, and we point fingers. This says you can learn to love again, and learn to put up with certain annoyances. And it packs a punch with such dignity, it'll blow your mind! If not? I guess I wouldn't expect that from everybody. But I loved it!",1333670400,4,1709,4.542207792207792

My admiration for it grows and I now laugh out loud when one character merely gives another a blank look; the revelation of character is pure joy to me.

Patricia Clarkson, Bobby Cannavale and especially Peter Dinklage are excellent, Michele Williams, what a treat, all fully complemented by brilliantly spare writing and very good direction.

I find Finbar McBride's fascination with trains very touching; the issues of great power under control (timetables, schedules, traveling along set tracks..) that trains represent, I imagine, might be very sympathetic to a dwarf in a chaotic and aggressive world... anyway, that's just a sample of what I mulled over once this movie was over, which is one of the joys of great art.",1319414400,2,844,4.767123287671233

I've watched it a half-dozen times since, and it never ceases to charm me.  I don't have children, but if you do, it's a family-friendly film that I believe would be a wonderful aid in their character development, as they'll see someone who is very different from themselves - a dwarf - is, in reality no different than anyone else.

However, even for her, this was a let-down. Dinklage is fantastic in every scene, but the plot and other characters just aren't interesting enough to make for a full length film. Joe the Hot Dog vendor is funny and enjoyable to watch, but his character wasn't really believable (others have pointed out the complete lack of profit in selling $1 coffees and hot dogs in an area with what seems to be a population of 20 people). The artist love interest was quite a bit too old for Dinklage unless they were going for a May-December romance which is never addressed. Also, there just didn't seem to be anything extraordinary about her to make Dinklage endure her coldness, abuse, etc., or at least there wasn't for us when we were viewing the film. I think that the actors did the best they could with the script and the pacing, but the film is the classic ""Indie"" type where, while the characters are well crafted, there just isn't that much in terms of plot to hold the viewer's interest. If you are a Dinklage fan, you might want to watch this for no other reason than to enjoy his talent, but if you are looking for more in terms of story and such, you might want to just go and watch ""Game of Thrones.""

2040558,3,B0001WTWDI,"While Peter Dinklage does an excellent job acting in the role of Finnbar McBride, a dwarf who is fascinated with trains, some unlikely events in the film detract. When Finn is leaving Hoboken to go to Newfoundland, 35 niles away, he walks along the busy NJ Transit tracks. A true railfan would not trespass like that and no tracks go directly from Hoboken to Newfoundland. While it would be possible to go through Hawthorne, NJ to get to the Susquehanna tracks that lead to Newfoundland, it would not be a route that someone could walk without getting arrested. Once he gets to Newfoundland, his interactions with Joe and Olivia are credible and his resistance to appear in front of Cleo's school class is understandable. After Finn gets drunk in the bar and is walking home on the tracks, he is run over by a train but survives, another unlikely event. If Finn had simply taken a bus from Hoboken (or the Port Authority bus terminal in NY) to Newfoundland, this film would have had a better beginning. Despite his determination to live in isolation, Finn discovers that people will not let this happen. Patricia Clarkson portrays her role of Olivia well and she helps this movie to the three stars. Bobby Cannavale is credible as Joe Oramas. If you are a railfan and looking for some train photos, there are a few of NJ Transit trains in the beginning of the film and Susquehanna RR trains in Newfoundland but they are brief.

2040564,4,B0001WTWDI,"Thomas McCarthy's 2003 drama, ""The Station Agent"", is a film decidedly not for everyone. A dwarf (played by Peter Dinklage, a real-life little person), inherits a train depot out in the boonies from his deceased boss (they had both worked in a small shop that sold and repaired model trains) and promptly moves into the depot to get away from all the stares and other nonsense people like him have to deal with on a daily basis.

The rest of the movie is basically Fin (Fin McBride is the character's name) dealing with the fact that no one leaves him alone once he moves into the remote depot in the wilds of New Jersey... not the guy who runs the coffee truck (played by Bobby Cannivale), who inexplicably sets up every morning in the deserted area near Fin's new residence, or the somewhat distracted artist covered with paint spatters (Patricia Clarkson) who seemingly is the coffee truck's only customer. They're both fascinated with Fin, first because of his dwarfism but later because he demonstrates (despite his efforts to be left alone) that he's an interesting guy, and kind of nice to be around. Soon, they (and a couple of others) don't even notice he's a dwarf and just want to get a little of his attention. You see, they're all misfits, too, if not in an immediately recognizable way like Fin.

Like I said, it's not a complicated, densely plotted movie, and many will likely cop a ""what's the point?"" attitude. But, if you can enjoy watching everybody becoming a little richer and perhaps happier from their new associations with each other (even Fin), this might be worth your time. In my view, ""The Station Agent"" is offbeat, funny, not too serious (though there are some serious moments), and overall a warm, resonant hour and a half or so.

I never got a chance to finish the film, having always been called away or on the go somewhere. I just naturally assumed that this was going to be some dark & overly depressing art flick that I'd regret watching. I was completely wrong.

The film follows the character of Fin, a man with dwarfism who prefers to spend most of his time alone. He inherits a train depot in the middle of nowhere from his deceased boss, assuming that nobody will bother him & that he'll be able to enjoy his trains in peace. Once he gets there he discovers that a well-meaning snack truck operator parks his truck outside the train depot & is intent on befriending Fin. Fin also meets the clumsy artist Olivia, who is depressed over the loss of her son years before.

I just loved this movie. There's so much to look at in this film & there's so many different ways people could interpret actions made by it's characters. I just really can't say enough good things about this film. Both my mother & I were skeptical that we'd like it, but by the end of the film both of us were saying that we wanted to buy the DVD.

If you like action flicks or are looking for something with tons of romance, sex or intrigue, this isn't the film for you. This is very much a slice of life movie. There's no big message in the film, nor is there any touchy feely ""the more you know"". Finbar doesn't teach the town how to appreciate people with dwarfism, nor is there any point in the film where he has this big triumph over adversity. It's just a film about a group of people befriending each other.

2040584,4,B0001WTWDI,"I picked up this movie on DVD a while ago as it had good reviews and was very cheap (it's currently about 4 on Amazon.co.uk), but I'd never gotten round to watching it. When I heard that its director, Tom McCarthy, and one of its stars, Peter Dinklage, had been signed up for HBO's adaption of George RR Martin's novel A Game of Thrones, it seemed like a good time to give it a go.

The plot is reasonably straightforward. Dinklage plays Fin, a young man suffering from dwarfism. Tired of having people comment on his height, Fin is a withdrawn man who seeks solace in his hobby of studying trains and his job working in a model train shop with his friend Henry. When Henry dies unexpectedly, Fin inherits a piece of property, an old train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey, and moves in, hoping to continue his life of solitude.

Fin soon finds himself uncomfortably drawn into the lives of several other people. Joe is a garrulous, friendly guy running the local ice cream van on behalf of his father, who is ill. A local woman, Olivia, almost accidentally runs Fin over and in her attempts to make amends they form an interesting friendship. A somewhat less-developed storyline sees Fin attract the attention of Emily, the local young librarian, who is having her own problems.

The Station Agent is a curious movie, which for most of its length seems to be heading down the 'heartwarming relationship drama' route before the director suddenly veers away from the threat of cliche city into a new and more interesting direction. It's a short movie (only 90 minutes) but it has a laidback pace, focusing on the characters, dialogue and their slowly building relationships in a well-developed manner. As well as Dinklage in an outstanding role, Patricia Clarkson as Olivia and Bobby Cannavale give excellent performances as Patricia and Joe, the former playing a badly damaged character and the latter being that slightly overbearing, slightly too friendly type of person I think most people have met at some point in their lives. Michelle Williams has a much slighter role as Emily but makes the most of her scenes.

The late-stage shift in the narrative is an interesting move. Without giving away spoilers, the way that McCarthy avoids corny resolutions to the character arcs and deftly subverts expectations of a neat ending is well-done. He doesn't go bonkers and kill everyone or turn one of the characters into a psychopath, but he also doesn't go down the totally corny route either. It's a thought-provoking way of concluding the film that works well, although it took me a while to get into its headspace.

The Station Agent (****) is a quiet, funny, entertaining and occasionally emotionally intense movie that is well worth a watch. As a piece of character drama, it is a rousing success and fills me with great hope for the HBO project.",1242000000,2,2850,4.796334012219959

One feels like one really knows the characters by the end, and it's one of those movies that when it ended, I said, ""Already?!"" It's one of those movies that you don't want to end - you want to stay with the characters longer, because they feel like your good friends.",1241395200,,520,4.427083333333333

He inherits a train station, and goes there to live alone, and to be left alone, and peruse his train enthusiasm to the fullest, alone.

Well, two people enter his life:  One is Joe, a young man of Cuban extraction, taking care of his father's caf on wheels business [a van].  He latches onto Fin to relieve his own loneliness. The other is Olivia, a woman failing to deal with death of her boy and is now estranged from her husband.  Oh, she almost runs Fin over while he's walking to the local store, and then again, when he's headed back.  What a way to begin life in a new home, right?

So, emotional wreckage and a quest for companionship are forced into Fin's life.  ""The Station Agent"" offers humor, tragedy, fulfillment and love when all a guy wanted was to be left alone.",1240185600,2,1031,4.46524064171123

In New Jersey, Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a four-foot-tall lonely man who chooses to live the life of a hermit in an abandoned train yard following the death of his friend. While he is there, he unexpectedly meets and befriends a couple of fellow loners. Troubled Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) is an artist devastated by the loss of her son and separation from her husband, while carefree and friendly Joe (Bobby Cannavale) runs a hot dog stand. The three unlikely friends each deal with their urge to connect compared with their individual need for isolation. Also starring Raven Goodwin, Paul Benjamin, and Michelle Williams. The Station Agent won the Audience award at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival",1238803200,,903,5.094594594594595
2040588,5,B0001WTWDI,"It's a fantasy, a character study, and a sweet story. It's funny and touching and quirky. It's improbable but, repeating, it's a fantasy. It's fiction that is wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed. I loved it and my family loved it and we loved how we felt after watching it. Good movie.

This is one of those movies that the artsy fartsy set really like, maybe because there is a vertically-challenged gentleman in it. Who knows. For those of you who like movies with real plots and things like that, look elsewhere. This is one of those movies that feels like it was done by your brother in some film school project and really isn't much of a movie. I love trains, so at least there were trains, but other than that, I can't get my two hours back from sitting through this.",1225756800,,571,4.39622641509434
2040590,5,B0001WTWDI,"Tom McCarthy has crafted a film of utmost sensitivity, insight and relevance. Aside from his witty script and insightful direction, the real power is created by the flawless performance of Peter Dinklage, a character of strong principle, suspicious of strangers. Along come the delightful  characters that melt his cold, empty heart, and make him alive again. Even though the excellent Patricia Clarkson got the best reviews, I thought Bobby Cannavale was the most alive, delightful character, a despairing individual, looking for a real friend. Michelle Williams, too, is so complete, sweetness personified. I can't blab away the plot, but how these characters come together and learn to love and overcome their angst is a credit to fine acting, direction and a very clever script. A small world is created that totally envelops the viewer, and the viewer actually cares. I waited too long to watch this film. Not many DVD extras, besides some deleted scenes, which, I think, ALL should've been left in. Highly recommended.",1223942400,2,1024,5.206060606060606
2040591,5,B0001WTWDI,"`The Station Agent' is one of those rare movies that lingers through your memory long after having watched it.  Not since `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lars-and-the-Real-Girl/dp/B0014D5RBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lars and the Real Girl</a>' have I felt this way about a quirky independent film where you fall in love with the characters and marvel at the warmth and eccentricity they elicit.

The movie starts with Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage, `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Bruges/dp/B0018BD9DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Bruges</a>') a dwarf (at least that's the term he prefers, so I'll go along with him) who works as a fix-it man at a used goods store.  Despite the tool man position, he's sharply dressed with a collared shirt and tie.  His moves are mundane, and the store's atmosphere is serene and quiet.  The deliberations of his life are similar.  He goes shopping.  He lives alone.  He doesn't have any companionship, and whatever entertainment he ekes out is spent by himself.  Then the owner of the shop (Paul Benjamin) dies.

Soon Finbar learns that he's inherited a train station depot from his deceased employer.  The shop is sold with its merchandise, so he pursues his newfound possession, nestled in a sleepy New Jersey neighborhood where much renovation is needed .

He's able to live in the station depot where in former times the thriving railroad stop provided a barber shop and a familiar store with convenience items.  (Although the trains that go through every night make sleep difficult.) Within a few yards of him is Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale, `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romance-Cigarettes/dp/B0010DM3R4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romance & Cigarettes</a>') a Latino who runs his ailing father's hot dog and coffee vending stand from a trailer.  Joey is gregarious and friendly with his new neighbor.  His overtures, however, fall flat on the taciturn Finbar whose silence speaks volumes about the ordeals he endures about his height.

The two get caught up as a threesome when a separated housewife, Olivia Harris  (Patricia Clarkson `Lars and the Real Girl') nearly runs Finbar over on the road juggling with the distracted driver syndrome we're all used to.  Trying to make it up to him, Olivia  finds a social context in which all three can get involved together.  Finbar finally opens up.  Eventually, they each have something to give one another, and the tripod becomes more complete with four when Finbar becomes infatuated with the local librarian (Michelle Williams) and extends to five when Cleo (Raven Goodwin), a curious and precocious African-American girl, shares his company and fascination about trains.

The differences between the three characters is so clever, yet uncanny, you can hardly believe how well their chemistry works together.  Whether gathering at Olivia's house and art gallery, going train chasing with two amateur filmmakers whose heights are at a great distance, or just sharing a meal, the movie gels with unusual sparkle and grace.

The film demonstrates that in the midst of the usual hustle and bustle a dwarf will especially be treated like he's invisible target and in the way.  But they all have hurdles to leap over.  In Olivia's split marriage arrangement some past secrets come creeping back into her life, and Joey's outgoing vivacity has little time and space when caring for a sick father.

Colorful, charming, and engaging `The Station Agent' is one of those gems that make you wish independent movies were always this good.

The movie starts off slow and lets you get to know each character slowly.  As you begin to meet them you start likeing them for their faults and flaws.  The movie is about the good in everyone and slowing down to actually walk in someone elses shoes.  People are not perfect and this movie takes you through the beauty of seeing that in others and accepting people for who they are.  I can't give this a high enough rating.

I found this film slowly lulling me into sleep.

The film is unrealistic and the performances are alright, but it's hard to believe this film. It lacks authenticity.

Bobby Cannavale, Patricia Clarkson, and (especially) Peter Dinklage all give truly powerful performances; they take Joe McCarthy's natural dialogue and bring it to life in a refreshing and poignant way.

Track it down and rent it if you are skeptical, and I'll admit, it may not be a movie that appeals to everyone; but you owe it to yourself to at least give it a shot.  This is a gorgeous independent film that runs circles around anything Hollywood has ever produced.",1200355200,,664,4.53781512605042
2040606,1,B0001WTWDI,"Real quick, I want to say that the 'one' star I'm giving this film goes WHOLE heartedly to Peter Dinklage.  In my opinion, he's like the 3M Company, in that he might not create the scene, but he sure does make the scene better.

Virtually everything in the movie that he does, I get.  And I get the whole 'I want to be left alone' thing that he does throughout the movie.  What I don't get, is why the people around him can't respect that.  All that seems to go on with the two other main characters is that they want to ingratiate themselves on him, and for what purpose I'd like to know?

And the thing with the hotdog vendor, you mean to tell me that he's from Manhattan, where there's probably a million people wandering the streets, and he's going to set up shop at a nowhere spot in the middle of nowhere?  How's he supposed to make money? Come on!

And that's another problem with the screenplay.  I mean, is the Peter Dinklage character supposed to be independently weatlthy or something?  How does he get his money for stuff--like the coffee and ALL those cigarettes?

And how does the Bobby Cannavale character suppose to live in Manhattan (of all places) if he can't even sell enough coffee to fill his gas tank?

This movie, I don't know?  It left a lot of questions for me.  I couldn't even get into the Patricia Clarkson character very much.  I mean, I know she's hurting because she lost her son.  But, I think it was the way the movie presented this plight.  I mean, it's kinda hard to feel anything, when we (the audience) didn't have the chance to know her son too.  (I mean, it's just the way things should be presented in a movie--so you get to feel for and grow with the characters.)  I can't see where this was done right with this movie.

All in all, I hate it when filmmakers go about making these 'quirky' little movies that don't really say very much and don't do very much.  I mean, remember when a 'quirky' movie was something like that gem of a movie:  Harold & Maude.  Or maybe even the original version of Sweet November?  Now that's the kind of quirk that I can get into--quirk with a point.  Quirk with great story telling.  I don't know what the Station Agent was trying to tell?

Either way, if you want to see Peter Dinklage in something good, then PLEASE check out his performance in Season 4 of Nip/Tuck.  In my opinion, he made the WHOLE season.  Peter Dinklage is what great acting is all about.  Can't wait to see what he does next!!!",1199923200,8,2475,4.3406113537117905
2040607,5,B0001WTWDI,"I saw this film several times on IFC and was taken with its quietness as well as its point of view.  For those who say the film is dull and lacking a plot, I say that they missed the film's point. This is a film whose plot envelops the viewer as opposed to develops; the viewer has to trust the story.  Its strength is in its subtlety.

And there are good reasons to trust the film.  The acting is superb as is the cast. The direction plays up the film's inherent strengths without overpowering it. One Amazon reviewer referred to this film as a compelling character study and I wholeheartedly agree.

The film is a quiet character study.  Those who confuse ""quiet"" with ""boring"" miss so much.  There is a world of difference between them.  ""The Station Agent"" is quiet, compelling, and a treat to watch.",1199577600,4,804,4.458904109589041

2040621,5,B0001WTWDI,"I'm picky and usually unwilling to try new things.  So when I had to watch this movie for a film class, I--with a deep sigh--went out to Blockbuster and rented the movie, put it in my DVD player--adding one more sigh, in case the point hasn't been made--and began to watch the movie, ready to take notes on all the technical aspects and whatnot.  I was so engrossed in the film by the time ten minutes had passed that I was ready to abandon my assignment (the note taking) and simply enjoy the movie.

It would be easy to say that the every day struggles of a dwarf, or any `little person' for that matter, makes up the drama in ""The Station Agent.""  There certainly would be enough evidence to back it up: Kids make fun of Finn (the main character, who happens to be a dwarf), adults--sometimes--do not notice him, and when they do, they often embarrass him; they take pictures of him and even heckle him the same way that children do.  However, when one looks deeper into the movie, they can see that the movie makes a statement on communication:  No one knows how to properly communicate with Finn--or other people like him--properly, which has convinced him to become a withdrawn person.

I'm certainly not going to give anything away, but I'll tell you this.  Two characters are introduced into Finn's life that cause... maybe FORCE is a better term...him to open up, to show them who he truly is.  It makes for a funny, touching, and inspiring drama.  The writing and the direction is top notch, each line and each shot conscious of the theme of the film and furthering what can only be described as an intense character study of Finn and the people who surround him.

For anyone wanting an enjoyable movie with a very tight story, centered not on action or melodrama, but a subtle look into the life of a man named Finn McBride, I recommend this film.  I not only enjoyed it, but I also took something out of it:  I'm going to be more open-minded with my choices in the future, because I wound up being very glad that I had experienced this movie.

2040622,5,B0001WTWDI,"Peter Dinklage, as Finnbar McBride, is outstanding in this movie. I enjoyed him in the TV Series ""Threshold"" and was sorely disappointed in it's cancellation. I was pleasantly surprised when I ran across his performance in this movie. If you enjoy excellent movies about unusual people becoming friends, then this should be up your alley. I haven't seen one this good since ""Tell Me You Love Me, Junie Moon"". Thank God at least this one is on DVD. This will appeal to most people, but especially to any that enjoy indie movies. The movie starts with two men working at a train hobby shop. One dies and leaves the other a small rural train station.

All the hobby shops assets are liquidated so he must move to the station agent office at the train station. The Station Agents office may be small and old, but it has character. Just like four new townspeople he meets. A gregarious hot dog vendor introduces himself on Finnbar's arrival to his new home. Once he thinks Finn is attractive to the ladies, he won't leave him alone. Soon after he meets a mature married woman that has lost a son and has a rocky marriage and likes to paint faces without eyes. Then a pregnant librarian and a grade schooler that wants him to be her show and tell. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family.

Clarkson and Carnavale are delightful as Fin's new friends, yet the movie is unimaginable without Dinklage's touching turn as a defensive man whose passion for trains helps stanch the pain of having lost his truest friend. Funny and deceptively simple, ""Agent"" is the kind of smart, refreshingly understated indie I wish we'd see more of from the Sundance crowd.",1185753600,3,595,5.696629213483146

  The story revolves around the lonely Fin, the lonely Joe who operates a hot dog truck, the lonely Olivia grieving over her lost child and marriage and Emily, the librarian, who is lonely in a different way.

  It's a stark little film, filled with fine performances. I really can't say more without giving away more of the story than should be given away. See it for yourself if you want a walk through the lonely side of life. Don't fear: the movie isn't depressing. In its own way, it is kind of uplifting as these lost souls come together.

2040627,5,B0001WTWDI,"Well, I couldn't but write about this one. Though probably just another regular Amazon purchaser, I'm not a habitual writer of reviews except i personally feel a movie/ CD is exceptional (good or otherwise). This one really deserves a mention and boy! it also merits all the accolades it received (22 worldwide award wins in total), not that awards always translate to mean quality but when one them is a BAFTA award then it's got to be worthy, yep! the Bafta is indeed a much more credible 'seal of quality'.

I really have to recommend this movie as it just completely 'hits the spot' and there were loads of times that we spontaneously burst out in uncontrollable fits of roaring laughter probably upsetting the (by now frustrated) neighbours. As with the general synopsis and personal opinions all of which i agree with e.g one from top reviewer Joseph H (somewhere above), it's a movie about a (possibly taunted by the mainstream world & subsequently tired) deeply reclusive, train/ railway lover, Fin (Peter Dinklage, someone i feel should be taken seriously as an actor) and his journey to and stay in New Jersey, all as a result of his dead employer's surprise estate bequeathal ... he eventually turns out to be the star of this NJ outback with all those that really got to know him being genuinely drawn to him, his mental wisdom & courage and not out of pity/ amusement because of his dwarfism. It's one of those movies that remind or make us come to realize that spending time with, getting to know and understanding people & things can really change our sometimes bigoted, tainted outlook and approaches.

The movie is a drama/ comedy and one that MAKES ALL THE SENSE in the world, I think it's one that anybody or family should/ could watch on a day when there's time to catch a movie. Every character in the movie contributes at least one very funny scene, starting from the young, persistent, 'free spirit' black girl, right down to the library attendant, phew!!! I laughed pretty much all the way through it and that's hardly something one sees in many drama movies, some comedies might achieve this with that odd bit of the producer's or script writer's (just for kicks) senseless scenery here and there.

Two of my funniest scenes remain 'Post-drinking, morning after' scenes, the first of which was when Olivia (Patricia Clarkson the Emmy winning, Oscar and Screen Actors' Guild nominee) overslept at Fin's house and the coffee/ hotdog dude Joe (Emmy winning, Will & Grace actor Bobby Cannavale) saw her leaving the house and the second scene was the reverse, when Fin and the coffee dude overslept at Olivia's and someone saw them. Some other more thoughtful, more sobering scenes include when Fin gets drunk in the bar and eventually crashes out seemingly paralyzed on the rail tracks which (being a true train lover) apparently was his routine daily way back home, with that oncoming train, Gosh!!! The scene then leads to one with the discovery of Olivia's unconscious body on the floor.

 All round good acting and I have to make a mention of the commendable child actress Raven Goodwin, who even by her pre-teen years had already been recognized with a Screen Actors' Guild and also the Black reel award nominations. Bobby Cannavale aka Joe, is extremely hillarious in most parts and i'm still laughing even as i write this.

Considering the movie's current going price even here on Amazon (approx $10 or 5), it's indeed a bargain for that much needed stress detox.",1180224000,3,3491,4.800332778702163

If you love movies for their complex and real characters, this is a movie for you.  If you love movies for action, climax, and drastic twists only, don't bother.  This simple and unique movie demonstrates that not all movies have to have a loud and explosive or dramatic climax to be intriguing.

The three main characters are all somewhat displaced, with Fin, the ""little person,"" inheriting a train station in the middle of nowhere; Olivia staying at a ""get-away"" home purchased by her husband before he ""got away"" and still grieving the sudden death of her young son; and Joe, the chatty hot-dog vendor who loves to talk and cook, who has returned to care for his ailing father and run his vending truck. These three characters apparently have little in common but a need to care and be cared for. Fin wants isolation, but the quirky characters in his midst won't allow that. He feels like a freak because of his size, but that goes away when he is spending time with his new friends. The tenuous bonds break, leaving the three characters with a terrible sense of loss that almost becomes tragic for two of them. Love truly triumphs in this film (not the romantic kind of love), and you know by the end that they will be okay. Beautifully written and acted, this film is a joy to behold.

You get to know the three characters so well that it's sad to not see how the rest of the story is going to go.  Of course it's also wonderful because you leave talking about these people as if they were friends.  No sequel is needed or wanted.

Yes every once in a while Hollywood produces a movie that allows characters to be interesting not because of a car chase, a gun fight or a sex scene.  Instead the beauty of 'The Station Agent' is these three characters are interesting because they are real.  These people have flaws and yet these flaws are not overplayed.  These people are fun and know how to laugh.  They also have hard times too.  It's all part of their story and all part of life.

This is a movie where dialogue - and sometimes communication without the limitations of words - carries the story and keeps our interest.  If you are a fan of good movies, this is the one to watch.",1173312000,3,997,4.24468085106383

If you're the type of person that gravitates towards movies in which the protagonists land on an asteroid to blow it up and save Earth from sure destruction, well, 'The Station Agent' is probably not your cup of tea.  If, however, you appreciate a movie with sneaky charm, sparse but meaningful dialogue, and personal interactions that seem pulled from real life, not scripted, then you're going to enjoy this film a lot.

Patricia Clarkson is always excellent.  While I think 'Pieces of April' is her masterpiece (and I'm not alone), she's in top form here.  Peter Dinklage deserves kudos, too.  Film buffs remember Dinklage's scene-stealing debut in 'Living in Oblivion.'  If you've seen Dinklage out of character on TV, you've seen what a lively, chatty guy he can be.  So, his turn here as an introspective man of few words represents a nice stretch of acting.  My top praise goes to Bobby Cannavale.  He's such an engaging screen presence.  His 'likability' quotient is off the charts.  The second you see Cannavale, a smile will start to form on your lips.  He's a joy to watch.  Check him out in the US remake of 'Shall We Dance?' in which he effortlessly steals scene after scene from Richard Gere.",1172880000,4,1250,4.780373831775701

Such is this movie.

A very quiet movie that reminds you that less is not more and more is not less. But less than too much is good for you, I the world and even All Gore...

If it's too quiet for you, forgive me. I really got carried away with the movie aftertaste.

2040646,5,B0001WTWDI,"We've had this movie for the last month, always putting off watching it for one reason or another. It is a very understated movie, with much of the action never commented on directly in the movie, but left up for the viewer to figure out. The plot is simple: Finbar McBride is a dwarf who loses his job when his best friend and boss suddenly dies, leaving him with a train depot in his will. Moving out to the small town where the depot is, all he wants to do is be left alone, but a combination of the Joe, the local Cuban hot dog vendor, and Olivia, a frazzled young mother who is grieving for the loss of her son, forces him to confront his new community, just as they are forced to confront him. Much of the humor comes from Joe, who forces himself into Fin's life, as well as the attempts by Olivia to try to make up for her first impression on Fin.

What's best about this movie is that it gives the actor who plays Fin the ability to show the viewer what it must feel like to be a dwarf, the constant stares and rude comments. But his portrayal isn't meant to invoke sympathy so much as understanding, an understanding that he's come to accept that as his fate, just as much as anyone with any sensitivity should decry it.

There's not a conclusion, per se, but there is a resolution, one that affirms the lives of the characters in the story inasmuch as you can see that they learned something from each other. It's like a small version (no pun intended) of The Breakfast Club or The Big Chill, and I'd recommend it.",1162684800,3,1524,4.251724137931035

It tells a story of 3 individuals bonding for no other reason than necessity of human spirit, one (Finn)is on an introspective search dealing with a change  in his life and the loss of a friend, (Olivia) is also dealing with loss and change and is trying to escape her reality and (Joe)happens to be at the right place at the right time and really has nothing better to do than make friends and bring the 3 together...the film shows the inner sensitivity we all have as well as the need to escape from what hurts us, combined with that is the innocence that we are all capable of tapping into when we realize life is what it is...you'll watch it again and again on rainy days or nights you're not quite sure what you're in the mood for...it's a keeper!

2040648,5,B0001WTWDI,"Taken out of context, the premise for THE STATION AGENT could be the set-up for a great joke:  a dwarf who used to be a train engineer and worked at a model train store inherits an old train station near Newfoundland, New Jersey and decides to live a life of solitude and makes it his permanent residence but a pesty Cuban hot-dog vendor and a beautiful female artist won't let him live in peace.  It sounds like a comedy, but THE STATION AGENT isn't a comedy.  Instead, it's a smart and slightly quirky drama written and directed by Thomas McCarthy about community and fellowship.

Fin McBride is a train lover who works in a model railroad shop in Hoboken, New Jersey.  One day his boss (and only real friend) dies.  In his will he leaves Fin the deed and title to an abandoned train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey.  Fin has had enough of being looked down upon by humanity and decides to begin a new life and moves into the station as his new home.  His desire for solitude is broken soon after arriving by Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) a Cuban-American who's running his father's hot dog while his dad recovers from illness.  Besides Joe, there's also Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), an eccentric and needy, but beautiful artist who has been separated from her husband ever since the accidental death of their son.  Joe just wants a friend and he really likes the new guy and Olivia just needs the companionship of people in general, feeling that their presence shields her from her own suffering.

None of these individuals are perfect, but as the movie progresses we are given a glimpse into the nature of grace and beauty and importance of community.  After hears of being ostracized by most in society, Finn felt he could do life on his own, but he really couldn't.  No man is an island.  Joe is a lonely guy looking for some adventure, a break from the monotony that his duty as a loyal son has brought him and he gains that through his friendship with Fin.  Olivia is a woman with some very deep emotional and psychological problems.  She is afraid to face those problems, but is able to do so through her friendship with Fin and Joe.

THE STATION AGENT is a small, brilliant film.  The acting is of Oscar quality (though the movie was largely ignored) and the performances are superb.  After watching the film, one is left with a feeling of longing to have friends such as these.  There's not much of a plot and the movie is more of a snapshot of the lives of these characters upon their first interactions.  The pace of the movie moves along like the third bowl of porridge that Goldilocks tries: not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Not everyone will enjoy watching THE STATION AGENT. It's not a movie that includes lots of action, car chases, explosions, or nudity.  Instead, it is a drama full of characterization and emotion illustrating a deep understanding of what it means to be alive.",1158796800,6,2915,4.565384615384615

As Finn, a dwarf who has just inherited an abandoned train station in Newfoundland, NJ, Dinklage carries the story on his small but exceptionally sturdy back, never begging the audience's sympathy but conveying worlds of anger, hurt, bewilderment and amusement in his dark eyes.  (His rumbly, seductive voice doesn't hurt either.)  As a local resident with a tragic past, Patricia Clarkson adds to her litany of complex women characters (and provides some of the film's biggest laughs when behind the wheel of her SUV), with stellar support from a garrulous Bobby Cannavale and a luminous Michelle Williams.

Peter Dinklage is a marvel in this, his first big lead role, as his character Fin McBride slowly comes to terms with life, death, loneliness, and the true meaning of friendship. Director Thomas McCarthy lets his story unfold in due time, and allows each actor live and breathe their characters. The supporting cast, led by Bobby Cannavale as the super-chatty hot-dog/coffee cart jockey Joe and Patricia Clarkson as the depressed artist Olivia, is absolutely top-notch. Without sounding pretentious - The Station Agent is great cinema.

2040663,5,B0001WTWDI,"Dinklage is spectacular in this film. It's a pity that the roles in Hollywood for small people are so limited (and ordinarily so stupid: elves, munchkins, jesters.)--Dinklage outshines most of his contemproraries and this is likely to be one of the few big, serious roles he will ever be given. (Maybe CG will get to the point where films will incorporate special effects that are the reverse of the ""hobbitizing"" done in the LOTR movies--turning Dinklage into a Cary Grant!)This film has a great set of oddball supporting characters, too: an overly needy hotdog seller, a spaced-out artist mourning the death of her son, a train-loving elementary school kid, and a very young (and newly pregnant) librarian ""hottie."" Dinklage plays the irritable Fin, who has inherited a decaying train station in rural New Jersey from a friend. Fin plans to move to the out-of-the-way spot and live in complete isolation. He soon runs into a wacky cast of characters (in some cases literally; Olivia, the artist, runs him off the road twice in one day) who won't leave him alone. Each has their own emotional baggage and their own peculiar hurts and disabilities. Against all odds, the motley crew become friends. The plot summaries for this film make it sound like a sapfest, but this movie is far from it. It is sort of ""touching,"" but in a of burr-like sort of way: prickly, a bit odd, and it sticks with you for a long time after.",1150848000,3,1419,4.748987854251012

2040665,4,B0001WTWDI,"Fin(Peter Dinklage) works and lives in a hobby train shop where he apparently pays his rent by repairing and making model trains. It is no secret that he is afflicted with dwarfism and the fact that he works on miniature trains as opposed to the regular-sized is no coincidence. When the owner of the shop suddenly dies, Fin finds out that he was willed an old train depot in rural Newfoundland, New Jersey. Fin doesn't have many possessions and doesn't know how to drive, so he simply ""walks the right of way"" to his new home where he can be away from other humans.

  The charm of this film is not in the typical Hollywood ""victim becomes hero"" plot, but the fact that people are just people and everyone has their own problems. When Fin reluctantly meets other people in the rural town, MOST of them don't seem to care one way or the other what his stature is. Fin seems to almost search for a reason not to care about these people, but inevitably he cannot avoid true friendship without pretense.

  Some of the things you will not see in this movie are what make it outstanding. There is no great struggle with an evil force, no gratuitous nudity, violence, language(the ""f"" word is used as just another adjective because that's how a young guy from New Jersey talks), or heroism by the lead character. Whenever Fin encounters some passing ridicule by either kids or ""adults"" he doesn't give it a second thought because he's heard it all before.

  Fin simply wants to be alone and discovers that he can be alone as long as he can share his loneliness with others. The closing scene is especially effective because it leaves you wanting more, which I think might have been intentional because the characters seemed at that point to be feeling the same way as the audience. They wanted more out of each other, but the credits rolled.",1146441600,3,1837,4.5592705167173255

While there, he is befriended by an outgoing Cuban coffee stand owner (Bobby Cannavale) and a troubled artist with a dark past (Patricia Richardson).  Together, they bond and embark on an unlikely friendship.

2040670,4,B0001WTWDI,"After his best friend dies a young man inherits a deserted railroad station in rural New Jersey.  Although he makes it abundantly clear he craves isolation, a three-way friendship soon develops between him, a troubled local artist and an outgoing Cuban lunch wagon owner.

  Peter Dinklage plays the taciturn young man in THE STATION AGENT, a charming, big-splash indy production from 2003.  Bobby Cannavale and Patricia Clarkson form the other sides of the rather unlikely triangle.  Nothing much happens in this movie - Finbar, the Dinklage character, is a train fanatic who wears an old railroad watch and spends many an afternoon watching trains pass by.  Joe (Cannavale) is like a big puppy dog, eager to break through the fence Finbar has build around himself.  Olivia (Clarkson) just happens to, er, run into Finbar a time or two and, like Joe, finds herself drawn to him.

 THE STATION AGENT is character driven, and the strong performances by the three stars compensate for a lack of plot or major emotional peaks.  There's almost too much subtextual stuff going on here, though.  For instance, Dinklage is a dwarf, or afflicted with dwarfism, or whatever the correct term is nowadays, and I think we're supposed to realize that fact contributed to his decision to turn hermit after his best friend dies.  `I think' is the operative phrase here.  I think the outgoing Joe is attracted to Fin because `there aren't many cool people around.'  I think Olivia... well, I haven't quite figured her out yet, but Clarkson makes of her such an appealing and interesting character, a flighty core personality further distracted by a loss the movie slowly reveals, that I stopped worrying about it.

  There's a nice commentary track with the three stars and director Thomas McCarthy.  There may be a few too many sentences opening with ""I love it when you did..."" but a tight crew makes good movies, and THE STATION AGENT is a very good movie indeed.",1143331200,,1950,4.890243902439025

Not only does he experience the loss of his friend, but Finbar seems to be having an existential crisis, which makes for vulnerability.  Ask anyone who has lived in isolation for a length of time: this predicament is unnatural for the human animal.

Enter other lonely hearts, the son of an invalid, hawking hotdogs, Bobby Cannavale, Mr. Bilingual.  Enter a divorced artist with a recently deceased son, Patricia Clarkson.  Clarkson proves herself incapable of driving her SUV which gives us some chuckles when little Finbar must avoid catastrophe.

2040682,5,B0001WTWDI,"The Station Agent is not a seriously involved movie that will leave you at the edge of your seat.  It is not your typical Hollywood slam bam and gratituitous violence and sex.  It is rather a simple excursion to our fears, our human conditions, our grasping for acceptance, our attempts at emotional stability, our belief in what's fundamentally proper, and most importantly, its an illusion of life brought to film by such talented actors.  Dinkladge and Clarkson gave remarkable performances in such a low-key movie, probably no one has ever heard of.  The movie paces itself in a slow monotonous, if somewhat unbelievably naive, manner.  The ending itself was somewhat trite and abruptly non-alarming, but in the end, we all understand what great pleasure it was to actually experience an hour and a half minutes of all these emotional rollercoaster rolled up into a heartfelt dramatic performance.

To call this movie boring would be one thing.  To call this movie a call to our heart strings would be more appropriate.  Try it and experience it yourself.  A truly amazing movie without all the pretentiousness and high-budget expectations.",1139184000,,1144,5.074866310160428
2040683,4,B0001WTWDI,"It was in my heart to embrace this movie. ""Quirky"" always attracts my attention. I had read the good reviews that hailed it as one of the best movies of the year. I've enjoyed Patricia Clarkson's previous work and have chuckled at Bobby Cannavale in the two or three things I have seen him in. I even passed some time with a student on his way back to Oxford who gushed over this movie.

And yet ...

The three leads are a compelling bunch. Writer/dirctor Tom McCarthy has gifted actor Peter Dinklage with a wonderful role that was neither sentimental nor condescending. Although the character is a dwarf, with very little tinkering his role could have been played by any actor. Dinklage offers up an ""everyman"" that has either chosen social isolation - or had it thrust upon him.

Clarkson's performance is understatedly sexy, simple and selfless (pardon the alliteration). Her grieving artist is so casually presented (no Streep histrionics) that I could not help but feel as though I were observing a friend on home video, rather than watching an ""ACTOR"" crafting a character for the camera. Thus, it was disappointing to see her character do something so theatrical and contrived that it reminded me that I was watching a performance. (I won't even mention the misconceived outburst thrust upon Dinklage's character.)

Cannavale is saddled an underwritten role. He is his usual charismatic self, but his character - basically an amiable ""puppy"" yapping at the heels of the two other characters - has no depth for him to explore. While not the most compelling, his character is the most likeable.  (I kept asking myself, what attracts his happy-go-lucky character to these other two wet rags?)

These are three charming characters in search of a plotline. There is no story arc for any of the characters. Their motivations are muddled. Nothing happens. There is no resolution - it just stops as though they ran out of film. Admittedly, there are a couple of dramatic events, but they seem more like dramatic devices rather than illumination of the characters. Granted, real life is often full of the meaningless and mundane - but is reading train catalogs enough to propel a movie?

The commentary provided by the director and three principals offers the inside scoop on making a low-budget film and is giggly and self-laudatory  enough to reveal that this was a pet project on which all had a good time.

I wanted to be ""cool"" enough to love this indy movie - I am just not sure that this movie delivered on its end of the deal. Ultimately I decided to give it four stars rather than three because, even with its limited story appeal, the characters in this movie are more compelling than those who populate movies with 50 times the budget of this thinly-plotted film.",1138579200,2,2772,4.80672268907563

Finbar McBride, the Station Agent, is a dwarf who is more than tired of the attention he draws. Peter Dinklage landed several choice roles after this performance and he deserved them, his performance is amazing.

The pace of Station Agent is slow, it winds leisurely like a lumbering commuter train. Finbar's anger is given plenty of time to smolder before he explodes. By the time he does you are rooting for him, you care about him, you would forgive him anything. Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale are equally engaging and sympathetic.

The movie revolves around Fin (Peter Dinklage), who has retired from active service and by happenstance inherited  (from a close friend) a railway depot in remote Newfoundland. Fin runs into a an extrovert Joe (Bobby Cannavale) who reluctantly runs a mobile coffee & snack shop. Fin has a strange friend in the form of Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) who is going through an on-the-brink marriage. The trio become good friends: Fin reserved most of the times, Olivia quirky and Joe hilariously talkative. Fin has a passion for trains and loves watching trains steaming on track trains. Olivia gifts a video-camera to Fin. Fin and Joe team up to become train chasers, recording chugging trains.
The friendship slowly takes deep roots. Olivia starts getting anxiety pangs because of her breaking marriage and wards of Fin to get into a depressed seclusion. Fin attempts to help Olivia, but she closes the door on her time and again. The friendship gets strained, but doesn't break. The watchful and caring Fin distances himself from Olivia, but keeps a careful watch. One day, he finds an unconscious Olivia (she attempted suicide) and rushes her to the hospital to the hospital. Olivia survives and their friendship resurrects strong as ever.

In one of scenes, Fin is walking along the road and almost gets run over by Olivia who was fiddling with her cell phone. Hilariously, the very next day Olivia almost runs over Fin again (this time she spills coffee all over herself and veers of course).

Not once is his character being exploited or exaggerated, rather, this film tells his story in an honest and heartfelt manner and he truly gives a remarkable performance....hitting a direct bullseye. The setting of this film is also unique, and will leave an impression in the viewer's mind forever.

The rest of the cast are good, sometimes very good, and provide very sturdy support, but this is a film to see due to Dinkage in an impressive role, and the actual story it tells.

Writer/director Tom McCarthy does a rare thing in modern film-making.  He respects both his audience and his characters enough not to tell the whole story.  When Olivia asks Fin not to stare, when Joe says grace in the most reverently irreverant way, when Fin demands that the crowd ""take a look!""; there are rivers of backstory to all these characters.

However, two new friends - the lonely Olivia (struggling with the death of her son and the dissolution of her marriage) and goofy Joe (who runs a hotdog stand near the depot and seems desperate for companionship) - seem to have other plans. It doesn't sound like much to hang a movie on, but I thought this was a great character-driven film. The performances turned in by all of the primary actors - Peter Dinklage as Finn, Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, and Bobby Cannavale as Joe - were exceptional. At first, I had a hard time warming up to Finn. However, the viewer quickly realizes that Finn has developed a tough hide in order to better endure the cruelties of being a dwarf. By the end of the movie, Dinklage allowed the character to soften a bit, and he ended up winning me over. Cannavale had some masterful scenes. He does such a good job of playing the well-meaning but somewhat annoying sidekick that it is difficult not to fall in love with him immediately. Clarkson, who seems at first a ditzy artist, quickly turns such pigeonholing on its ear, displaying remarkable depth when discussing her dead son and her failing marriage.

All in all, I thought this was a great movie about what it is to be someone who both craves isolation and companionship.",1125878400,3,1624,4.6

2040707,5,B0001WTWDI,"A moving,humorous, and never boring slice of life. It has been a long time since I saw a film so well structured and well written. The main protaganist is a man whose past is a veiled mystery and whose current life is opened to the viewer in an unaffecting and honest way. A train ""buff"" who happens to be a dwarf moves to a small deserted railroad depot building he inherits. The Cuban operator of a food vending truck, the emotionally fragile artist(a hilarious first meeting) compromise the main triangle of relationships. This viewer developed an immediate rapport with these three characters. The fact of the main characters dwarfism never seems to bother the small triangle of amity that develops. This film made me want to know all about these characters...to care about them...a rare feat in alot of films these days. I especially liked the Cuban-American young guy who provides so much humor and warmth throughout this film.....he seems like an ordinary working-class guy anyone could be friends with if they tried...perhaps they do not try because of his heritage....how elated he is when Fin(Finbar) moves into the nearby train depot....he works his way into Fins' life in a clever, humorous, and loving way. The character of Olivia...is more complex....an artist seperated from her husband....has a deep emotional hurt inside....waiting for someone to help release it....I am sure she is taken aback at how this emotional burden is somewhat lifted and eased by her two new friends. I laughed and cried and enjoyed myself immensely watching this film. Its subtle touches of humor, the unusual messages of writing on signs in the cameras' view,the addressing of Finbars' dwarfism in both cruel and gentle ways.....Finbars voice....great voice...wonderful actor. I highly recommend this film.....for everyone....some swearing may bother parents of young children..but this is a small masterpiece to be savored.",1119916800,4,1919,5.213592233009709
2040708,4,B0001WTWDI,"""The Station Agent"" is yet another film that I was curious about partly because of its New Jersey locale. Early on in the story we move from Hoboken to the more rural Newfoundland (pronounced NewFOUNDland), when the main character (Fin) inherits the train depot where he plans to live in solitude. Alas, it is not meant to be, as he can't avoid running into others, or rather, as is the case with Olivia, they can't seem to avoid running into him, (almost) literally. There is also Joe, who parks his Dad's mobile hot dog/coffee stand near the depot every day, despite it being a less than ideal place to draw customers, since trains no longer stop here. Nevertheless Fin as ""The Station Agent"", might have known that he would encounter others with varying degrees of baggage. He carries his own baggage too, as he is a man of quiet dignity who is tired of his stature as a dwarf making him an easy target for ridicule. Then there is the young local librarian, with her share of issues as well, in addition to a grammar school student who would like Fin to speak to her class about trains.

While at first it appears that these characters have nothing in common, it soon becomes clear that in addition to their own individual demons and travails, they are all genuine and basically good-natured. The movie's conclusion has a sort of ""we may as well chill out and make the best of it"" feel to it, which is sufficiently satisfactory.

Not being much of a TV viewer, I'm not familiar with any of these actors, but I think they all do a fine job. If you enjoy character-driven (as opposed to plot-driven) pieces, I can easily recommend ""The Station Agent"".",1119052800,6,1652,4.558922558922559
2040709,4,B0001WTWDI,"Directed by Tom McCarthy, The Station Agent stars Peter Dinklage as Fin, a dwarf that moves to New Jersey after his boss dies of what we presume is a heart attack. Dinklage is joined by Joe (Bobby Cannavale) the hot dog and coffee vendor and artist Olivia (Patricia Clarkson). It is in Newfoundland, NJ that Fin inherits an abandoned train depot and begins to build relations with the quirkie town people. If you watch close you can catch Michelle Williamns (from tv--Dawson's Creek) as the librarian.

  The Station Agent is subtle writing and dialogue that flows smoothly from the well polished actors. Dinklage is impressive in this role as his brooding face coveys the pain and alienation he feels from his height and how people treat him. Clarkson is wonderful as usual with a stunning portrayal of a mother who has a deep loss and is unable to move on with her life; while Cannavale conveys his own lonliness and worry over the health of his sick father. The script and director move all characters into emotional development and you can see how each grows and comes to grips with his or her own pain. The Station Agent definately moves at a slower pace but this is necessary to facilitate the emotional connections that must be made between individuals, which is especially true for Fin who finds himself so isolated. The movie also highlights the fscination with trains and will be an interest to many train collectors out there. A movie worth renting and watching with friends, the Station Agent is a train trip you will want to take again and again.",1118102400,4,1559,4.724264705882353
2040710,5,B0001WTWDI,"I have to put this movie in the top 3 of my all time favorites. I have watched this movie at least 5 or 6 times and I still think that it is one of the best movies ever made.

The friendship that these 3 characters developed was so uplifting and realistic. I can't quite find the words to describe just how I feel about this movie. All I can say is ""it is well worth spending the time and/or the money to see/purchase this movie.""",1115251200,4,430,4.0
2040721,4,B0001WTWDI,"Writer/director Tom McCarthy has made a most unique character study in 2003's ""The Station Agent"". It's a very quiet, episodic film, only 88 minutes long, but surprisingly assured and often compelling for a first-time filmmaker. It all centers on a dwarf named Fin, who seems rather indifferent about his life, especially after his boss dies and leaves him a train station in the outer reaches of New Jersey. Not so coincidentally, his passion is trains, and he just wants to be left alone to ""walk the right of way"" on the tracks. Of course, he keeps meeting up with people who are drawn to him. The two most prominent are Joe, a boisterous Cuban-American from Manhattan taking care of his ailing father's hot dog stand, and Olivia, a manic-depressive artist caught between her anguish over her son's death and her anger over her separation. There's also a shy little girl named Cleo and a young, friendly librarian, Emily. All of them look beyond Fin's diminutive stature and initial poker-faced demeanor to find him someone worthwhile to know. Consequently the movie feels more like a fable than a realistic portrait of discrimination and isolation. But the approach makes sense since we come to care about Fin's situation in spite of the fanciful fact that he doesn't seem to have any financial worries.

It all sounds like the makings of a life-affirming TV-movie, but the methodical pacing and superlative acting transcend the more predictable aspects of the script. Peter Dinklage captures all the emotions that seep out of Fin after a lifetime of relative solitude and pained ridicule. Initially, you wonder why everyone wants to be his friend given his outward surliness, but he conveys the soulfulness that makes this particular plot contrivance believable. TV staple Bobby Cannavale makes Joe so likable with his high energy that you overlook his character's otherwise annoying neediness, and Patricia Clarkson gives her typically stellar performance as Olivia, her barbed intelligence intact, even as her character seems to descend into what appears to be an irretrievably depressive state. The seemingly effortless bonding that occurs among this trio provides the film's chief pleasure. On the sidelines, there are nice, affecting turns by a better-than-expected Michelle Williams as Emily and Raven Goodwin as Cleo. Unfortunately there are also some melodramatic flourishes, such as Fin's drunken assertion at the bar, his hurtful rejection by Olivia and the appearance of Emily's white-trash boyfriend, that don't seem to serve much purpose beyond confirming the fact that Fin needs love and friends. But these scenes don't detract from the obvious affection which McCarthy has for his characters, especially Fin.

For a film made on the cheap (less than $500K in twenty days), it has a surprising cinematic feel with all the well-composed train shots, credit going to Oliver Bokelberg's expert camerawork. The DVD package has a nice audio commentary track by McCarthy and his three main actors with Cannavale providing particularly amusing anecdotes. There are five deleted scenes, three that provide more context to the relationship between Fin and his boss and the last one is I believe an alternate ending with the appearance of Joe's much-talked about father. Well worth viewing.",1115164800,4,3299,5.222641509433962

I watched it based on quite a few positive recommendations and I have never felt so betrayed. I have no problem with movies that are low on plot but character-driven but you have to create interesting characters. What's more, I don't think any of the reviewers noticed that the characters in this waste of time are just one-dimensional steroetypes (unbalanced woman with issues, bitter short-guy and annoying, prying neighbour).
""Oh my, how could these three misfits ever become friends? They are obviously so different fom one another... Oh my, they did become friends despite their obvious differences!!""
CRAP
This movie tries so hard to be a quirky independent film it forgets to deal with things such as character development, plot or dialogue. A chimp could have wrote a more thoughtful script.

Finbar inherits an abandoned train depot when his friend Henry, the owner of the model train store where Finbar works, dies.  He goes there to live away from people but ends up gradually befriending several inhabitants of the small community around his depot.  Writer-director Thomas McCarthy and Dinklage do a very good job of portraying Finbar's fear of making himself vulnerable to the kinds of rejection and insult he has endured in the past without resorting to sentimentality.  At times, I almost wished for a little more sentiment, but Finbar is far too dignified to give in to easy emotion.  This is a very quiet film about good people with big problems who learn that there's nothing better than a friend to share some time with to make one's burdens seem lighter.

This movie truly seeks to include such a person even when that person is unwilling at first.  The only real criticism that this movie can take is that it doesn't really care about telling a story and yet there are things filling up the time called subplots and none of these things actually come to fruition and results in an unsatisfying ending, but that's not to say that this film doesn't have it's merits, it does.  While being very welcoming it doesn't contain much dialogue.  The dialogue that it contains is very short and brief.  I'm not sure if that's the influence of the main character, or simply because the screenwriter is ADD.  Ultimately, none of this matters because the film is really about the main character and showing his situation.  As that, it succeeds very well and it doesn't attempt to be charming at all, which is a positive.  It also features a performance by Michelle Williams that's a small supporting role, but it lets her put down the glam card and just look like an ordinary  and natually beautiful woman, which is nice.  Her romance with Dinklage (the main character) is very cute as well.",1112313600,2,1333,4.4937759336099585

Peter Dinklage plays Finnbar McBride, a dwarf who has a passion for trains and inherits an abandoned train depot, where he intends to live in solitude, that is until well meaning neighbors and townsfolk (Bobby Cannavale as Joe the hot dog vendor and Patricia Clarkson as local artist Olivia) insist on including Finn in their activities.

2040728,4,B0001WTWDI,"I'm really on the fence with this film. I know that it's very highly regarded by the film industry, and that it won a BAFTA award. Obviously, there are people ""in the know"" who think it's terrific. It's one of those ""nothing really happens"" movies, instead being a character piece with human emotion. The problem I have with it is that it doesn't really delve into its characters as much as I feel it should have, and the emotion that's displayed - with one notable exception - is extremely minimal.

The story centers around a dwarf (Fin) who inherits half an acre of land, on which is a home and a train depot. Fin is a train enthusiast, and instead of moving into the home, he takes up residence in the train depot. That's a quiet, telling aspect of his personality, and I enjoyed that glimpse into what makes him tick. However, it was what followed that has me on the fence. Beyond that slight ""tell"", and his repeated insistence to be left alone even when some very kind people who accept him for exactly who he is are trying to befriend him, we don't learn very much about his character at all. He definitely grows as a character, and that's absolutely essential for a book or a movie, but the reasons for his growth are unclear: unless it was simply the slow breaking down of his walls by a congenial vendor (Joe) who runs a hot dog/coffee/maybe ice cream stand out of a small trailer right outside of the depot, and a woman (Olivia) who - in two absolutely hysterical moments that left me in stitches - nearly ran him off the road while paying no attention to her driving.

Joe, Olivia, and Fin all become good friends - but I really didn't know why. The vendor seemed desperate for friends, and that was easy enough to understand. We met some of his so-called friends, and they were horrendous individuals who made fun of Fin. If I had been in that exact situation, I might have handled it by breaking their noses (although I doubt it). However, it did me that angry and I exclaimed that I *would* have broken their noses. Anyway, that's hardly material.

Earlier in the film there were also some very sad and angering moments when kids, as well as adults, made fun of Fin either in whispers or directly out loud so that he could hear. Trying to put myself into the mind of a dwarf who has likely spent most of his life being mocked and made fun, it's a little more understandable as to why he wants to be left alone. However, before his friend died and he inherited the land, he did have a group of friends who were all train enthusiasts. So he wasn't completely cut off from the world.

All of these characters are immensely likeable, and the actors put in excellent performances. But like I said, I'm on the fence. I can appreciate movies that tell you more about characters by what is unsaid as opposed to what is said, but I just felt that more should have been said - and I'm not talking monologues here, I just wanted to hear a little more about what Fin felt. There was a perfect opportunity to tell those of us who are ""tall"" exactly what it feels like to be a dwarf, and I felt that the film - while definitely showing us uncomfortable moments in his life - fell short on that. For example - when the group of kids made fun of him, how *exactly* did he feel? All we saw was a blank expression on his face, which did imply that he has learned to simply ignore these taunts, but I wanted more.

Still, I did like the film, mostly because, as I said, the characters are very likeable and the performances were top notch.

All of my reservations aside, I would still recommend this.",1107648000,3,3597,4.3692077727952165

A short ways into the movie, his boss dies and leaves him an abandoned train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey. He packs up his meager belongings and sets out for this remote country place where he can at least be left alone.

When he arrives at the station he finds that it is right next to the still-active railroad tracks. It is run down and it only has a couch to sleep on, no phone, nor any other utilities. He seems satisfied that he can live his life of train watching in solitude. But the first morning, he is awakened by Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a sociable young man whose hot-dog truck is parked right next to the depot. Joe is very persistent in wanting to be Fin's friend and he never seems to stop talking. Another would be friend is Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), who he meets because she nearly runs over him twice in the same day with her car.

Fin does all he can to avoid these new acquaintances by taking long walks on the railroad right-of-way and checking the timing of the trains at a bridge. But they manage to wear him down. They learn a little bit more about each other every time and learn to respect each other's privacy as well.

This film shows us how important friendship is and how it grows. That you should not judge people by how they look, but what they do. And that no one really wants to be a loner.

2040743,4,B0001WTWDI,"Thomas McCarthy's ""The Station Agent"" is a joyous and wondrous tale of three rather unique and quirky individuals whose lives intersect at an abandoned train depot in rural New Jersey.

When a dwarf named Fin inherits the station from a business partner, he moves there, hoping to find a place where he will finally be free from all the prying eyes, pointing fingers and knowing smiles he's been subjected to all his life.  However, Fin finds that, even in isolation, it's not always easy to be alone.  As soon as he takes up residence in his new abode, he meets up with Olivia and Joe, two people with whom he seems to have little in common, but with whom he manages to forge a lasting friendship.  Olivia is a struggling artist who lost her young son two years earlier in a freak accident.  Grief-stricken and trying to put the pieces of her life back together, Olivia experiences major mood swings that make it hard for others to get close to her, no matter how hard they try.  Fin, likewise, is a shy, taciturn young man who has pretty much given up the possibility that he will ever be able to have a ""normal"" relationship with other people (let alone women). Thus, he turns inward, throwing up barriers in an effort to keep people out of his life, hoping that, by doing so, he will avoid getting hurt any further.  Joe, on the other hand, is a garrulous young Cuban who runs a hot dog stand right outside Fin's station, a man who chatters on endlessly about any subject and sees nothing wrong with forcing himself into Fin's life, blithely unaware that his company is the last thing Fin wants.  Yet, Joe is so openhearted and good-natured that even Fin, though desperately craving privacy and silence, hasn't the heart to dampen the young man's desire for companionship and friendship.  Somehow, through the trials and tribulations of daily living, these three strangers develop a bond of friendship, love and mutual support.

The set-up for ""The Station Agent"" could have led to any number of serious pitfalls, given its potential for unbridled quirkiness and feel-good sentimentality  However, McCarthy has managed to walk that fine line between preciousness and charm, contrivance and originality, calculation and spontaneity.  He has fashioned an adroit screenplay filled with likable characters, rueful humor, clever one-liners and restrained slapstick.  The film is less concerned with storyline and plot than it is with tone, mood and character interaction.  Throughout the film, we seem to be eavesdropping on the lives of these people, understanding that we will never fully know all the life experiences that have gone into making them the people they are today, but happy to spend just this little bit of time with them anyway.

""The Station Agent"" is a masterpiece of fine acting, with Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale delivering pitch-perfect, bell-ringing performances.  As the reticent dwarf, Dinklage is particularly brilliant at creating a character out of little more than body language and facial expressions.

A story of lonely people who find out it is easier to be lonely with other people...The story of Finibar Mcbride (Peter Dinklage), a dwarf, is presented in short scenes, revealing his story without using many words, just bringing small details which make up his life story. One of the opening scenes shows Finn working at the ""Golden Spike"", a train repair store. A child walks in and is surprised to see the short Finn. His surprised reaction is only the first of many reactions to be revealed to the viewers and there comes a point when these reactions are hard on the viewer just as they are on Finn and one can understand his need to build a ""protective shield"" against the world .

The store owner, who by small gestures is understood to be protective towards Finn is part of the secluded secure world Finn has created for himself. Not a lot of talk (one of the ""deleted scenes"" shows a lunch scene where each one sits alone and reads his newspaper), mutual love for trains and a regular fixed day pattern. This pattern is shattered when the store owner dies and leaves Finn a train station in the New Jersey rural area. This is the beginning of a new life for Finn who unwillingly finds himself dragged to a new friendship with two characters. Olivia Harris (the great Patricia Clarkson with whom I fell in love in ""Pieces of April""), a woman trying to overcome a loss and Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) a young talkative character whose coffee stand is just near Finn's new house. The building of the relationship and eventually a small change in Finn is brought about by small details and touching moments.

My ""movie experience"" was profoundly enriched by the additions part of the DVD which really gives you a better understanding of the movie and the characters. Sort of a further layer of understanding.  I really enjoyed the deleted scenes part, amongst which I would like to mention a scene which is a different ending for the movie. This beautiful scene shows Joe and Olivia sitting reading next to Finn's house (Finn is missing from this scene) and discussing Finn's purchase of a mobile phone and Joe's father which has returned to work. This scene is done in the same style of the real ending scene (giving some optimistic hope for the future) but also showing a glimpse of Olivia's better mental state (she is going to have her brother and his kids for the weekend). These deleted scenes were a real pleasure to watch. Another feature which I immensely enjoyed is a viewing of the movie with the comments of the director and the three main characters. First of all I liked to hear the conversation between the actors and to be a participant to their private jokes . This discussion is especially entertaining as the good chemistry amongst the three is very evident and includes Patricia's clarkson giggles and laughs and a very large part of the internal ""behind the scenes atmosphere"" which I believe is typical of a low budget movie such as this one. The team discusses a lot of ""on the spot"" decisions, changes and additions due to technical problems. It was interesting to hear about the enormous help received from friends (who did their parts for free, so I understand) and to see the point of view of those from within (the director for example was very concerned that the letter received by Finn did not resemble a real bill).  I think I could really understand how the parts were really shaped up by the characters. I was also touched by their comments or silence, such as the director telling us how Patricia Clarkson was glad to end her scenes ""inside the house"", as they were so intense.",1100476800,3,3839,4.626099706744868

This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, and I can't really explain why.  Fin's character, while aloof at first, becomes extremely endearing, and I found myself drawn to all three main characters in different ways.

This movie stars Peter Dinklage as a dwarf named Finn, who inherits an abandoned train depot in a small New Jersey town where he befriends/acquaints two other locals, Joe and Olivia.  Joe, played by Bobby Canavale is the comic relief character of the year in the way that he lazily maintains his hot dog and coffee stand outside of the depot while constantly trying to befriend Finn.  Finn, however, through years of being self-conscious of his appearance wants nothing more than to be left alone.  The film provides a wonderful portrayal of loners, and how they never are truly just that.  The film also contains one of the most abrupt endings of the year, and as a sucker for wanting all the pieces tied up, was unsatisfying.

The story is very straight forward, with an opening about Finn's life in Hoboken at a train shop and subsequent move to rural New Jersey where he rapidly meets Clarkson's Olivia and Cannavale's Joe. Together the three navigate each other into their lives, in what amounts to a stirring and heartfelt story of friendship and peace. This is a very soothing, moving film.

The extras on the DVD are minimal. Several deleted scenes and commentaries by director McCarthy, Dinklage and Cannavale. The film itself is the best part.",1099267200,,687,4.965217391304348

What I liked most about this movie were how the different characters interact with Finn (Excellently played by Peter Dinklage). For example, parts where Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) and Emily (Michelle Williams) say things like ""you don't have to say anything, or we can eat quietly,"" help show their empathy with Finn's need for peace quiet.  That same empathy helps them see him as a person, and ask him about his interests and where he's from.  This contrasts with Joe's or the little girl's treatment of Finn. Overall, a very charming film with well-filmed scenery.",1099094400,3,650,5.05607476635514

The story examines the ebb and flow of friendship - how we let our guards down, and then put them back up, then let them down again.  And the steadfast presence of friends through these struggles.

2040765,4,B0001WTWDI,"Tom McCarthy's THE STATION AGENT is about a man who likes trains far more than he likes people. He just wants to sit and read, walk along the train tracks watching locomotives pass and keep to himself. He doesn't think there's really much particularly interesting about his manner, and he doesn't really have much need for friends or attention.

But Fin was born a dwarf, which is likely what motivates him to remain isolated and what motivates gawkers, jarringly rude people and sentimental souls to take an interest.

At the beginning of THE STATION AGENT, we see Fin, brilliantly played by the talented and actually quite handsome Peter Dinklage, go about his life amongst a rude population until his sole friend in the world dies. Though Fin is sad, of course, he inherits land with an old, isolated train depot on it - and he ventures to it so that he can finally live without bother from other people.

But like it does with all of us sometimes, the world will just not leave Fin alone - no matter how much he craves silence and isolation.

Fate, I guess, knows that Fin needs people, needs friendships, needs ties to the outside world, so it provides him with new friends Joe and Olivia, played by Bobby Cannavale and the always-excellent Patricia Clarkson. Joe runs his father's catering van that he parks everyday outside the train station, even though it barely gets any traffic and Joe himself cannot stand being alone because he can't stop talking. Olivia is a perpetually distracted artist who lives in a nearby house and comes by Joe's stand and the station everyday because they're her only real connection to the outside world.

Because they ask Fin more about his interests and his life than about his condition, he finds himself opening up to them.

Through Joe and Olivia, who is masking some very real problems of her own, Fin is able to change his life. Somewhat. And the story of these friendships and these unique characters are what give THE STATION AGENT its considerable charm.

I identified with Fin's character personally because I was born with a disability as well. With a disability, you find sometimes that you want people to acknowledge your differences, and other times you'd rather be accepted and not stared at. THE STATION AGENT gives Fin distinct moments when he attempts to either thwart attention or grab it, not sure of how he himself feels toward what makes him physically different. It's a smart film that can do that, that can allow a character to both embrace and fight against adversity at the same time.

Because that compromise is difficult in life, the film ends on an ambivalent note, but with one of hope, and I found that fitting.

I recommend it because it knows what its character is going through, knows why he's going through it and knows that there are no easy answers to his situation.

It also knows that sometimes you just shouldn't be alone.",1098057600,23,2902,4.7287128712871285

the characters he encounters and they're situations. Oh yeah and

Finn is a dwarf. In fact that seems to be the whole point of the film. A could chunk of this movie is Finn walking around railroad

tracks,Finn walking home and Finn writing things down. He's oooh

so quiet around alot of loud aquintances. Well quietness for it's

own sake doesn't necessarily make for a brilliant movie but the

people who made 'The Station Agent' certainly think it does. So

2040767,5,B0001WTWDI,"Arriving under the dwarfing shadow of the big-budget epics like Matrix: Revolutions, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, sometimes there comes a film that is so refreshingly short, sweet, and simple that it has the power to, well, move you.

And yes, I use the word ""dwarf"" deliberately.  He's not a midget.

I'll confess, when I saw that the main character in this independent film was of hobbit-like proportions, I feared for the soul of the movie-making world.  I expected Wizard of Oz comical, or Lord of the Rings fantasy.  Or, and I prayed fervently this wouldn't happen, a sermon.  But instead what I got was a miniature enlightenment and some very fine low-budget entertainment.

Sweeping the big three at the Sundance Film Festival (Best Film, Best Director, Best Performance) The Station Agent is set in a rural New Jersey town and involves the lives of three desperately different people finding out what it means to interact with each other.  It's touching, painful, hilarious, and most of all, it's real.  The film is soaked from start to finish with the kind of rich characterization you might expect from a P.T. Anderson picture.  Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a dwarf who, moving to a new community after inheriting property from a deceased friend, deals with the aloneness and self-pity that comes with being a small man in a big world.  Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) is his hot-dog selling, fast-talking, inhibition-free neighbor whose personality is so overbearingly friendly he can't make friends.  And Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson) is a divorced painter struggling with depression rooted in her child's death.

Writer-Director Thomas McCarthy explores themes of loneliness, friendship, and all the humor and tragedy that come between with such honesty that you frequently find yourself laughing and crying in the very same instant.  It doesn't sugarcoat the pain of relationships, it doesn't make the every-day moments melodramatic, and it doesn't preach... too much.

This isn't the film for the part of you that wants an ending with an overwhelmingly passionate romance, a sweeping death scene, or a sense of resolution.  The characters are much the same as when the film started, and though their problems are not fully solved, they are in the process of discovering people outside of themselves.",1096502400,3,2384,5.089974293059126
2040768,5,B0001WTWDI,"I saw this great film the other day.  A complex film that works on so many different levels.  Its about loss and redemption.  Its about a dwarf named Fin who undergoes a personal transformation from a angry, bitter, withdrawn, hard, cold man at the beginning into a warm and caring gentleman by the end.  With the help of four well-drawn characters that befriend Fin.  There's Joe (an outgoing chatterbox who operates a coffee stand/truck).  Then there's Olivia (a painter and a mother who had lost her son and separated from her husband).  There's also Cleo (a little black girl who shares an interest in trains).  Also there's Emily (young, naive librarian with an abusive redneck boyfriend).  These characters, in effect, reveal Fin to be something entirely different from what we initially see.  They chip and chisel, and peel back Fin's cold, hard exterior shell to show Fin's real, true character.  The true character that would have been had he not endured such a tough, painful life as a dwarf.  Ironically, Fin makes more friends in this remote, rural town than he ever did living in the big city.  The loneliness of the big city.  This is a deep film with a lot of powerful things to say and lessons to be learned if you look closely.  Now I know why this was a Sundance darling.

Well, I could really relate to the upbeat Cuban guy from Manhattan stuck in the sticks with two people who want to be hermits (a midget with a train obsession, and a woman depressed at the loss of her son). I just wish I had as much energy as he does. I would have dumped papas snack truck and been on the next train back to the city. The acting and directing are excellent.

If there was an Academy Award for ensemble acting these folks deserve one. Low keyed, unforced, this is what acting and directing is about, these people know their craft.

Fin is played intensely and to perfection, and Olivia is a rather daffy artist with very real demons that rend the heart. Joe, however, steals the show. The outgoing one of the bunch, he practically forces the other two into the friendship, and his charisma, kind heart, and spastic personality are a delight to watch. Watch for Bob Cannavale (I think I spelled that last name right) in the future, because he is pretty amazing.

From beginning to end, we are invited into Fin's dark world of always being the sideshow, Olivia's tortured mind, and Joe's lonliness and openness. Their interaction is realistically portrayed, the friendships are beautifully drawn for the audience, and even the ending is perfect, because it is what friends do.

2040788,4,B0001WTWDI,"The Station Agent (Tom McCarthy, 2003)

It says something about the state of filmmaking and popular culture in America that The Station Agent won or was nominated for thirty-one awards at various places, including winning the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, the Audience award at Sundance (where it was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize), and three Independent Spirit Awards, but between the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, The Station Agent was nominated for, and won, zero. Perhaps someone at the Academy needs to put their ear a little closer to the ground, because all those other film societies really knew what they were doing here.

The Station Agent is the story of Finbar McBride (indie favorite Peter Dinklage, of Safe Men and Living in Oblivion fame), a train enthusiast from north Jersey. Upon the death of his best friend Henry (Do the Right Thing's Paul Benjamin), he inherits an old train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey. After the will's executor tells him there's nothing for miles around there, Fin moves down and sets up shop. He didn't however, count on the local hot dog stand setting up in his parking lot, run by the garrulous Joe (100 Centre St.'s Bobby Cannavale), eccentric artist Olivia (three-time-Best-Actress-award-winning Patricia Clarkson, recently in Wendigo, Far from Heaven, and The Safety of Objects), lonely town librarian Emily (Dawson's Creek alum Michelle Williams), or inquisitive schoolgirl Clea (Raven Goodwin of Lovely and Amazing, in her second screen appearance), all of whom latch onto Fin in different ways, and for different reasons. How's a guy to be left alone?

This whole cast is simply tremendous, but it is Clarkson who truly shines. She always brings a touch of greatness to everything she touches. Goodwin proves herself a capahle enough actress at playing herself; hopefully we will soon have her in a role where she can show her talent. Cannavale and Dinklage make great foils for one another, and their energy does a good deal to move the story along. Put all of this together with the simplest of stories, how people interact, and you could end up with something stolid and motionless (like The Big Chill), or you could end up with something brilliant (like The Breakfast Club). The Station Agent falls, without a single toe over the line, on the side of brilliance. It takes a while to get going; twenty of the film's eighty-nine minutes are setup (and more was planned, judging by the deleted scenes, most of which are pieces of Fin and Henry's interaction; they're wonderful disembodied pieces, but would have dragged out an already-too-long beginning).

The Station Agent, however, turned out to be a pleasant surprise; its characters are real, complex and original people and the interaction between them interesting, realistic and not at all sentimentalized.
Peter Dinklage has the starring role as Finbar, a dwarf who inherits an old railroad station house that he moves into. He  soon meets Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a gregarious food vendor and Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), a troubled artist. Both of these people impose themselves on the reclusive Finbar; Joe's meal truck is parked right across from his new home, and Olivia almost runs him over. Finbar is a truly well developed character. Marginalized from society, he takes refuge in his passion for trains. His plight of being treated as an oddity is made clear without making him an object of pity. Only with great reluctance does he gradually open up to his new friends. Joe and Olivia, however, have their own troubles and the relationship among the three is not always smooth.
The Station Agent explores what can happen when people who have little in common are brought together by circumstances. Finbar, Olivia and Joe interact  mainly because they find themselves in physical proximity to each other; as events in their lives unfold, their tenuous bond is almost broken. One problem that low budget films often have is a feeling of claustrophobia, as there are only a handful of characters. The Station Agent almost falls into this category (with these three people running into each other everywhere they go), but fortunately there are a few good supporting characters to fill out the landscape; a librarian who finds Finbar attractive, Olivia's ex-husband and a young girl who shares Finbar's fascination with trains.
The Station Agent, written and directed by Thomas McCarthy, is slow-paced and character-driven. I highly recommend it to fans of good, original independent films.",1087689600,7,2136,5.1
2040807,5,B0001WTWDI,"MOVIE: This film is probably the best film I've ever seen. With movies these days it is so difficult to find a true film. A film not a movie. The Station Agent tells the story of a dwarf named Finn. He worked at a train model store and was close friends with the owner. When the owner dies he leaves Finn his old station house, and with no home or family this is where Finn lives. All his life Finn has to deal with the bitter remarks people make at him and the beating of society has left Finn isolated and alone. All he wants is to be left alone. While at his new found house in Newfoundland, New Jersey, catchy symbolism isn't it, he meets a hot dog stand guy named Joe and a middle aged woman named Olivia. They slowly become friends and share the fact that each of them are struggling with their lives in some aspect. Each of them discover that being with each other is a lot more rewarding than being isolated from the brutality of life. The movie is also filled with rich symbolism and each shot is framed with so much meaning. The town as mentioned before is called Newfoundland, New Jersey. Finn being a train enthusiast works out for the symbolism especially the scenes of him walking the train tracks. Trains have a structured path, only one way to go. Finn has limited himself to this ""one path"" way of life and with his new found friendships he starts to create his own path instead of letting society move him. This film is not only a comic gem but it is emotionally powerful. First time writer and director Tom McCarthy has proven himself to be a great filmmaker with his first film, a rarity now days. This small film has such a powerful effect on the audience that you will be thinking about it long after you see it. After I watched it on DVD I said the same thing to myself that I said after seeing it in the theater, ""man, what a great film"". People who limit themselves to movies like The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars have my pity because they will never know what they are missing. I guarantee that this movie will move you emotionally and will be an experience you will never forget.

VIDEO: The DVD has a very decent picture, and in order to get the full effect of the vibrant shots and the train track scenes it is best to watch on a HD Widescreen tv. Even though the acting is what made the film, the cinematography was also exceptional.

AUDIO: Basic 5.1 Audio mix that does the job. This is a character-based movie and really doesn't require a heavy based sound mix.

PACKAGING / EXTRAS: The DVD comes in the standard Armaray case with no insert.  The only extras are deleted scenes and a commentary by McCarthy. Miramax has also thrown in a bunch of trailers for their other movies like Cold Mountain, City of God, The Barbarian Invasions, and some others.  Being a small movie that probably many average movie goers never heard of, it was expected to have a bare-bones release on DVD. I really feel bad that movies like this never get to see a wide release or a large amount of interest because these are the movies that film was invented for.

2040808,4,B0001WTWDI,"""The Station Agent"" is a quiet, quirky little character drama set in the rural town of Newfoundland, New Jersey. Fin McBride (Peter Dinklage) is an ordinary man who can't seem to escape the constant attention of strangers because he is a dwarf. When he inherits an abandoned train station, complete with station agent's building, in this remote New Jersey town, he jumps at the chance to become a recluse. Upon moving into the station, he discovers that it is not as out of the way as he might have hoped. A very friendly coffee and hot dog vendor named Joe (Bobby Cannavale) sets up shop practically on his doorstep every day. Though he might try, Fin can't avoid Joe or Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), an accident-prone artist who lives nearby.

""The Station Agent"" is about three people who at first glance might appear to have nothing in common beyond a coffee stand. But these people are interesting, and it's interesting to watch them develop a friendship, sometimes in spite of themselves. Thomas McCarthy has written a fine character piece and directed an attractive film, but these characters could have easily been two-dimensional without superb performances from the actors. Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson, and Bobby Cannavale have made the recluse, the grieving woman, and the motor-mouth interesting individuals who are full of life. They're people whom we might not mind running into if we were passing through their neck of the woods, which is a great achievement for a writer or casting director. ""The Station Agent "" presents the vitality in life's hardships and the value of unlikely friendships without being overbearing.

The DVD: Bonus features include deleted scenes and an audio commentary by writer/director Thomas McCarthy and actors Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson, and Bobby Cannavale. The commentary is very conversational and pretty constant, without many breaks when nothing is said. The participants talk about their experiences filming the movie and, in doing so, convey a lot of affection for the project.",1087603200,3,2046,5.1782477341389725

2040810,5,B0001WTWDI,"THE STATION AGENT is a miniature masterpiece.  Director Tom McCarthy has achieved on a small budget, rapid sequence filming, and no frills media use, a film that proves that this art form is alive and well right here in the US.  The story is simple but cogent:  Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a dwarf who has been working as a model train maker for an African American store owner Henry Styles (Paul Benjamin), one of the few people that treats him without prejudice. Their relationship is gentle but supportive. Henry literally drops dead and Fin discovers he is the sole heir in Henry's will: Fin now owns a dilapidated train depot in Newfoundland, NJ.  Having nowhere else to go, Fin moves into his new home, seeking solitude from the world of ignorantly derisive people.  But parked in front of his space is a Hot Dog and Coffee wagon operated  by garrulous Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a warmly friendly guy who wants to hangout with Fin.  Fin also encounters the slightly flighty artist Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) who after two 'accidental encounters' on the highway seeks out Fin also.  In his attempt to foster anonymity Fin avoids these new would-be friends, spends time at the local library reading about his passion - trains - and encounters the fragile librarian Emily (Michelle Williams) who also finds him strangely attractive.  Another ""invader"" into his space is a young African American girl Cleo (Raven Goodwin) who simply wants to understand Fin's life and plight.  The story is simply the communication that grows among these disparate people, each needy, each with occult compassion trying to surface.  This interaction is all there is to the 88-minute film, but in its brevity and spare dialogue we are drawn into the lives of these fragile folk to the point that saying goodbye to them at the end is heartrending.  What a cast!  Dinklage, Clarkson, Cannavale, and Williams are as fine as they come, creating as much character with body language and lingering looks than with verbiage.  An absolutely first rate film in every aspect.",1087344000,6,2053,4.930232558139535
2040826,5,B0001WTWDI,"This is truly a wonderful film and easily the best of 2003!
  Last summer was a pretty dismal one for me, film-wise. It seems I was seeing one bad film after another, culminating in the ghastly ""THE HULK"".
  Then last fall I saw John Sayles' latest film ""CASA DE LOS BABYS"" and this magical work of art and felt refreshed. These two films convinced me that there were filmmakers out there still interested in telling good stories filled with wonderful and interesting human beings.
  I won't dwell too much on the story but let you discover it for yourself. Just let me say that its about a young man named Fin who is a dwarf. He has withdrawn from the cruel world that has taunted and mad fun of him all his life and has turned his passion to trains. This film beautifully depicts his meeting with a number of fellow humans also cast adrift and alone in their lives.
  This is a film you simply must see if you haven't yet. And this DVD presentation is a good place to discover it. The anamorphic widescreen picture is clear and sharp and the soundtrack is quite pleasing to the ear. The extras are a few deleted scenes ( mostly from the films beginning ) and a commentary track with the brillant writer/ director Tom McCarthy and his three leading players, Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale that is not as informative or insightful as one might like. McCarthy did not talk at all about the genesis of the film, where he got the idea, etc. And none of the actors talked about their wonderful characters or what attracted them to the film. Still, it is good to listen to once if only to see this great film again!
  Today, the word ""masterpiece"" or ""classic"" are thrown around too easily ( it seems every film that comes out is a masterpiece or an instant classic, if you believe the hype ), but this is one film that I can truthfully and with full confidence say is a masterpiece and destined to become a classic!
  Please, if you haven't seen it, see it, I know that if you love great films, you'll love this! And if you have seen it and love it, you've probably already bought this DVD and don't need my recommendation. But I will shout it to the rooftops for all to hear- THIS FILM IS A TREASURE! - George Bauch.",1087171200,4,2236,4.387409200968523
2040827,5,B0001WTWDI,"I just saw a screener of this film the other night, and I have to say, it is one of the best films of the year! I loved it! Peter Dinklage deserved an Oscar nomination, if not the Oscar itself! His performance was so real, and it connected with you on a certain level, and you just knew how this character felt. Everyone else in the cast was awesome as well. Patricia Clarkson was hilarious and moving, as was Bobby Cannavale who plays the extremely hyper and energetic Joe.
All in all, I think that Thomas McCarthy has given us a treasure. It's one of those films like LOST IN TRANSLATION, where you just come away from it feeling so effected by it that you want to watch it all over again to get that same feeling. The scenery and use of atmosphere helps to give you the feel of this film, and it will stick with you soon after the film is over. The score by Stephen Trask is also a plus. I loved it, and I hope its on a CD somewhere.

2040830,5,B0001WTWDI,"I do not damn with faint praise when calling this a ""small"" film, nor when doing so is any offense intended to Peter Dinklage who plays the role of Finbar McBride, the central character. After the death of his employer and friend who owns a store offering model railroads and various accessories, McBride learns that he has inherited from him an abandoned train station and sets out on foot to begin a new life there. Only four-foot tall, by now he has endured all of the hurtful jokes and taunts about dwarfs, ""Munchkins,"" etc. He seeks solitude in what seems to be an eminently appropriate residence, given his passion for railroading in all shapes and sizes. McBride arrives and establishes residence, determined to have minimal contact with others who live in the town nearby. Unexpectedly and at first reluctantly, he becomes friends with Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) and then Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), both of whom sense within McBride a stature belied by his diminutive body. This is a ""small"" film in the sense that under Thomas McCarthy's brilliant direction, it is fully developed within quite limited parameters. (I am reminded of the fact that the greatest athletes ""play within themselves."") I can think of nothing to delete from this film, nor of anything to add. Also, to their credit,  McCarthy and his cast resist every opportunity to sentimentalize (thereby trivialize) any of the lead characters' weaknesses as well as strengths. Finbar, Olivia, and Joe struggle (with mixed success) in their relationships with each other. Their behavior is not always admirable. But separately and together, they celebrate the nature of humanity, whatever the shape and form of it may prove to be.",1077753600,81,1710,5.0638297872340425

As a testament to vagrant, ephemeral human connection, it conveys a bittersweet sort of joy that is rarely seen in conventional movies these days. Writer-director McCarthy (on my most watched list from now on) takes us through this gentle story almost effortlessly, highlighting the little quirks in each character's personality without remotely turning them into offbeat rural stereotypes.

I wasn't sure what to expect but, after reading several reviews, wanted to see it. It was absolutely incredible, and the other 500 or so folks who ventured out on a cold and snowy Friday afternoon to see a cinema society screening seemed to enjoy it as well. The surroundings and the receptive audience only made the movie that much better.
It's hard to describe the movie to friends...a movie about a dwarf who likes trains and inherits an abandoned depot. I simply tell them that it is about so much more than trains. But there are those ""been there, done that"" moments to which railfans will relate: screening home movies of trains in a dark room filled with railfans, and chasing trains (although I have never had as much fun as the characters had in this movie). I will let others talk about all of the other plot points, etc. If you are a train fan, see it...you will see yourself (and, oh, the thought of owning a depot and cars next to a track). If you are a movie fan, see it...it is a tremendous production. If you have a pulse, see it...it is a moving, touching, wonderful, funny, sparkling movie. Make your friend see it. I did, and they loved it (one even ended up at a complex which was also showing porn movies, but that didn't deter them from enjoying the movie).

2040833,5,B0001WTWDI,"The Station Agent is one of those movies that begins slowly but then grabs the viewer and doesn't let go.  More than anything it teaches viewers that ""families"" come in all sorts and types.
Finn, a dwarf played by Peter Dinklage, works for a store, which specializes in toy trains and their repair.  He is also a member of a train club, which chases trains and videotapes their train rides, or chases.  Sullen and withdrawn Finn inherits a piece of land in New Jersey with a depot on the grounds when his boss dies. Retreating to the depot, he finds a brash, loud and outgoing young man, Joe played by Booby Cannevale who is working at his father roadside coffee stand. Joe tried to reach out to Finn and slowly immerses himself in Finn's life, walking the train tracks with him and filming a train as they ride along in his car. Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, an artist who is separated from her husband and grieving for her young son who was killed, plays the third member of this unlikely trio. The three of them slowly become friends and one can't help but get the feeling that these are real people rather than actors playing roles. How they reach out to one another and form their ties is the basis for this movie and one well worth seeing.  While Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannevale are well suited for their roles, the movie ultimately belongs to Finn as he comes to terms with his size and desires.

On this journey, they learn about the social pitfalls of love and romance, and the price each has to pay for their own shortcomings. ""The Station Agent"" does well in utilizing its main theme in acting as a magnet in drawing its audience closer together, therefore tying any probable ""loose ends"" (to which there are few) together, looming large in the attention-getting factor. In totality, this is a motion picture that blends uplifting theatrics and climactic dramatics together quite flawlessly, and will definitely leave a positively lingering effect on its audiences.

Due to his ""freakish"" appearence he has developed a hard outer shell and simply wants to be left alone. However, because of circumstance and proximity he is befriended by two locals equally as lonely. As the companionship slowly developes each character becomes more and more real.

It leaves the viewer with the the obvious question, why are we so put-off by appearenece and people who are different and why can't we get passed it? I spoke with a guy after the movie let out about the film. He told me it was unrealistic that two ""normal"" characters would go out of their way to befriend a dwarf.

2040847,4,B0001WTWDI,"It becomes apparent early on that ""The Station Agent"" is not your usual film. It sets a slow, methodical pace which will not satisfy the typical multi-plex audiences. It presents characters without offering a lot of explanation for them. You are required to pay attention to how they act in order to find out who they are. There are no long, informative, tell-all speeches by these people, the kind that you would find in a more mainstream movie. And, somewhat surprisingly, there is no real resolution to the three main lives that the film touches upon. And yet, somehow it all works.
Peter Dinklage plays the lead role in ""The Station Agent"". He is Finbar McBride, a solitary man who works with an older black gentleman named Henry in a Main Street-style shop which sells & repairs model trains. Henry and Fin are train enthusiasts, and even watch home movies other people have made that are nothing more than different camera angles of trains. When Henry dies suddenly, Fin discovers that his friend has bequeathed him a half-acre of land in Newfoundland, New Jersey. On the land is an old train depot, where the station agent used to reside. Here is where Fin decides he will go and live, and it is where the main point of the movie begins.
Across the tracks from the train depot is Joe, an obviously lonely young man who runs a portable coffee and hot dog stand. He quickly rushes to befriend Fin, but finds it at first to be of some difficulty. Fin, you see, is a dwarf, and has put up a protective barrier to shield himself from what can often be an unkind and unthinking humanity. When Joe invites Fin to the local tavern, the dwarf refuses. We later find out why. Though Fin tries to separate himself from people, he is only human, and therefore becomes resentful of his home-made prison of loneliness. This leads to him eventually accepting Joe's goofy version of friendship. The third lonely person added to the mix is Olivia, a forty-something woman who has recently lost her child through death, and her husband through mutual separation. Olivia is not only lonely, but also fragile and unstable. Together these three lost souls attempt to bolster each other through simple companionship. Sometimes it works, while other times it doesn't. Add into the mix two more lonely people: a young librarian woman who takes a physical interest in Fin, and a little girl named Cleo who likes to hang out with Fin and old abandoned trains more than with kids her own age, and you have a movie full of disheartened, dejected characters.
But ""The Station Agent"" is certainly a unique film. It moves at its own pace, and tells its story through what the characters say, rather than what they explain. Have you ever noticed that, in most movies, if a character has some deep, dark pain in their life, there will inevitably come a scene (or perhaps multiple scenes) where the character will unload and explain everything that's going on with them? They will provide life history, present angst, and maybe even future worries. Not so with ""The Station Agent"". You'd just better pay attention to what these people say, as unimportant as it sometimes may sound, and as infrequently as it may come, if you want to grasp what's really going on with them and what their roles are within the film. This is not a movie for relaxing and letting your mind glaze over. This is a movie which treats the viewer with respect. It assumes you are intelligent and alert. And I appreciate that. My only real complaint with the film is that there are still some unanswered questions that the writer/director could have taken some time in answering, although I suppose they are not super-vital to the story.
The acting job by the three leads - Peter Dinklage as Fin, Bobby Cannavale as Joe, and Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, is realistic and superb. These definitely feel like characters, not actors. If the locations used for Newfoundland, New Jersey are not real, then they sure did a good job making them seem as if they were. There is such a flavor of truth to the whole film that it can only help propel it to a higher level of entertainment. And a special mention should be made for Stephen Trask, incidental music composer. His work here fits in perfectly with the mood of the movie.
""The Station Agent"" is not your typical movie-going experience, but that is a good thing. It is a slowly unfolding film about lonely people who find each other and do what they can to help themselves through the kind of companionship that only humanity can provide, in its unique, quirky way. It doesn't explain, it simply 'is'. The characters seem like real people, and we find that they are easy to relate to. Already you have the pieces in place for a great movie. And ""The Station Agent"" does not fail in that regard.",1070841600,9,4787,4.659574468085107
2040848,5,B0001WTWDI,"Fin (Peter Dinklage) wants to be left alone. He works in a Model Train Shop, where he is not likely to be seen. His major passion and love is Trains: loves the romance of them, their ability to take you away from it all, the bigness and solidity of them. Because of his size, Fin has had a troubled life and he avoids people like the plague so as not to be wounded. He has one friend, a fellow Train Shop worker who dies one day and leaves Fin a Train Station House and an acre of surrounding land. And Fin goes there to live out his life as far away from those who have hurt him his entire life. But he didn't count on Joe (handsome, robust, smack-talking but lovable Bobby Carnavale), a snack truck vendor or Olivia (lithe, sensitive, barely able to keep it together Patricia Clarkson), a neighbor who is trying to get over the loss of her son and a divorce.
The dynamics of these three is interestingly askew in that Fin, wary and committed to the notion that he will always be alone and without friends, is actively pursued by Joe for that very thing: friendship. And Olivia, having literally run Fin off a road twice, seeks Fin's forgiveness at first, then ultimately his friendship. It's like the old adage: when you want it, you can't get it and when you don't, it's there for the taking.
""The Station Agent"" is a gentle, quiet film. One that concentrates on the small wonders and circumstances of a life lived in a solitary manner. It's about what happens when you finally find people who look beyond what there is to see on the outside and seek out the very core of your being and more importantly, find it in all its brilliance and resonant splendor.",1070064000,,1660,4.392857142857143
2040849,5,B0001WTWDI,"I just came back from seeing ""The Station Agent"". I thought it was a wonderful film. After seeing ""Mystic River"" last month, ""The Station Agent"" is a wonderful antidote to the heavy drama of the Dennis Lehane novel. Peter Dinklage as Finn is worthy of an Oscar nod. It was so refreshing to see a dwarf be portrayed as a human being as opposed to a cartoonish stereotype. Here the viewer sees a man who is only 4 feet, 5 inches tall isolate himself emotionally from society because all his life he had been teased and taunted by people. Finn is forced to interact with his new neighbors in Newfoundland, NJ. Bobby Cannavale as the annoyingly nosy hot dog/coffee vendor Joe and Patricia Clarkson as the grieving Olivia Harris also gave excellent, if not convincing peformances in the film. Joe reminded me how annoying I used to be as a teenager by following other people around. As annoying and nosy Joe was, he had a good heart. He wasn't as obnoxious as tv's Steve Urkel. Patricia Clarkson was wonderful as Olivia Harris. I really enjoyed the scenes when she first encountered Finn in the beginning of the film. Those were hilarious. One of my favorite scenes in the film was when Finn was in the bar getting drunk. I loved how the cinematography was shot from Finn's drunken perspective. Although her presence in the film was albeit brief, former Dawson's Creek star Michelle Williams also performed well. I always did think that she was the talented actor of all the Dawson's Creek cast. Her character's interaction with Finn was sweet. Without giving out anything, I didn't expect for the film to end the way that it did. Not that it is a bad thing, I was just surprised. Some people might be put off by that but I liked being surprised and it pretty much wrapped things up within 90 minutes. ""The Station Agent"" is a character-driven movie. I really enjoy movies like ""The Station Agent"" than the garbage that is currently being churned out at the moment by Hollywood. Human drama makes for a more interesting movie than all the special effects in Hollywood. ""The Station Agent"" is definitely another favorite film of mine I have seen this year.",1069459200,2,2150,4.660526315789474

Finnbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is the central character and is extremely powerful but quite - he is a dwarf and gets ridiculed left and right but still does not loose his composure (except for once) when he goes to the local bar and gets drunk. But then every human being has his or her weaknesses. Finn loves train and details of train - his dream comes true when he goes for train chasing with his friend Joe (the hot dog vendor). Life is difficult for him but he accepts it in its ways and in his way - rather than fighting it head on, he used diplomacy and works around the difficulties. Thomas McCarthy has done an wonderful job of mixing the characters with the environment even though they all stand out odd. Olivia the local artist who is also suffering from a lose of a son becomes friends with Finn and Joe and in the process befriends her already estranged husband. Just one point - I think the photography - especially the canvas selection and the light effects could have been little better. Still this is one of the year's best movies.",1069459200,2,1241,4.423580786026201
2040851,5,B0001WTWDI,"Tom McCarthy's ""The Station Agent"" is the sort of movie that--if it even gets made in America--seldom makes it past the festival circuit to a wider audience. That ""The Station Agent"" did so is an unexpected and delightful surprise. This gentle, poignant film--which unfolds like a perfectly wrought short story--tells the tale of Fin (Peter Dinklage), a four-foot five-inch, thirtysomething guy who works in a model train store and has a lifelong fascination with trains. Used to the mockery of those around him, he lives devoid of human contact other than his sympathetic boss and a few fellow train enthusiasts. When his boss dies, he leaves Fin a decrepit train depot in a rural part of New Jersey; Fin, having no other place that will take him in, goes to the depot to live. There, almost against his will, he begins to establish contact with a few of the local residents, including two who in their own ways are as lonely as Fin: Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a convivial, motormouth hot dog vendor saddled with a chronically ill father, and Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), an eccentric artist grieving over the loss of her small son and her bitter estrangement from her husband. How Fin, Joe and Olivia slowly, clumsily discover their common bonds forms the main story of ""The Station Agent."" It's scarcely an earth-shattering story, and the low budget is always evident; yet ""The Station Agent"" never puts a foot wrong. The story and dialogue continually offer small, revealing surprises about the characters, and the performances of Dinklage, Clarkson and Cannavale are exquisitely natural and unaffected. ""The Station Agent"" is a movie most people will probably never hear of, but those who see it will cherish it.",1067990400,133,1712,4.989510489510489
2040852,5,B0001WTWDI,"A man born with dwarfism (Peter Dinklage) retreats from society and becomes a loner. He has a fascination for trains and after he inherits an abandoned train depot in New Jersey, he's forced to come to terms with his shy nature, and in the process meets up with two other like-minded loners, an artist (Patricia Clarkson) struggling with the death of her son, and a friendly hot dog vendor (Bobby Cannavale) who hungers to share his love of food. What makes THE STATION AGENT a better-than-average film is that the three characters are portrayed in such a realistic and complex manner. Each character has rough edges as they constantly deal with their problems. While Cannavale's character is the least developed of the three he does succeed in adding much laughter to the plot. His interactions with the other two characters are well written and funny. Watching this film was a real treat. Enjoy!",1067817600,3,897,4.869281045751634
2040853,5,B0001WTWDI,"Several lonely characters in a small non descript New Jersey town do not make for a major Hollywood drama. But this ""small movie"" is very human and manages to sustain your involvement without the usual gratuitous doses of fight or flesh. Finnbar, the main character, is a midget who inherits a disused smalltown train station when his boss dies. He converts this to his new home next to the tracks where trains no longer stop. Initially trying to shun contact with others, his life becomes slowly woven with other characters in this little New Jersey town of Newfoundland. There is Joe, the hot dog/coffee stand vendor, who continually receives calls from his ill father; Olivia, the artist haunted by the accidental death of her young son, which has estranged her from the husband from whom she has now seperated; a pretty young local town librarian who admires the midget's striking facial features; and a young black schoogirl who keeps popping in and out from seemingly nowhere, seeking to get Finnbar to overcome his reluctance to make a presentation on trains to her grade school class. What binds Finnbarr to Joe and Olivia is their common sense of intense loneliness, for which the abandoned silent tracks provide an unmistkable metaphor. Several superbly shot scenes and some wonderful dialogue are what keeps you hooked throughout this movie in addition to some very fine acting. You almost begin feeling after a while that you are next to the same railway tracks or in the same living room as the three main characters. I only wished, when it was over, that this type of movie were more the norm. Please see this movie!",1066435200,24,1630,4.845878136200717
2040854,5,B0001WTWDI,"Not many films have a dwarf as the main character--especially one whose fascination is trains.  Finnbar McBride, played by actor Peter Dinklage, is such a man and has immersed himself in trains as, we understand with the progression of this great film, a retreat from the world of normal humans who too often delight in ridiculing him for his stature.
If this were a film characterized by stereotype and lack of imagination and intelligence, Finn would emerge as the valiant hero, fighting the odds that Mother Nature dealt him.  But, luckily, it is not. Filmmaker (writer-director) Thomas McCarthy is much too smart and sensitive to do something stupid like that. Finn is very quiet, but has his weaknesses, shown in a great scene at the local bar in tiny Newfoundland, New Jersey where Finn's been left an old train depot by his recently deceased former boss.
In the bar, he proceeds to get truly drunk and confronts the inner demon of his enormous frustration at his dwarfism by standing on the bar and taunting everyone else to look at him.  He's a fully rounded person--he shuns human company but when it's foisted upon him--by garrulous young Joe, the hot dog vendor, and by Olivia, the klutzy but beautiful local artist--he does respond.  He does laugh with his new friends, he does understand that others may have pain, maybe even deeper than his.
This is one of the year's best films because it dares to raise a true, deep, and honest voice amidst the glitzy schlock that Hollywood still cranks out to rake in the millions.  This is a film that should not be missed for its depth of characterization and emotion, its courage, its honesty, sensitivity, and above all, its deep understanding of what being human really means.
Very highly recommended.",1064793600,300,1757,4.823920265780731
2040855,4,B0001WTWDI,"THE STATION AGENT is a film not easily categorized: part comedy, part drama, entirely quirky.
Peter Dinklage is Fin McBride, a train lover who works in a model railroad shop in Hoboken. One day, his aging boss drops dead, bequeathing to his employee an abandoned train depot in the backwater, New Jersey burg of Newfoundland. Fin simply walks to his new holding by following the tracks. He's never learned to drive, you see, because he's only 4'5"" tall - born with dwarfism.
Once established in his odd residence, Fin's desire is for asocial solitude - a response to the frequent ridicule visited upon him by humans of normal stature. To achieve this self-protective shell, Fin verges on being antisocial. But, to his dismay, he soon finds that other needy humans gravitate to him. First, there's the lonely and chatty hot-dog vendor, Joe (Bobby Cannavale), who's only in town to run his ailing Dad's roach coach, which he parks every day outside Fin's front door. Then there's the artist Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), separated from her husband by the death of her young son a couple years previous, an event for which she bitterly blames herself, the kid having tumbled from some monkey bars in the brief moment that she wasn't looking. Finally, there's the young and pretty local librarian (Michelle Williams), shabbily treated by her jerk boyfriend, and a young Black girl (Raven Goodwin), who pops in and out of the story from nowhere and whose chief purpose in the plot is to persuade Fin to talk to her school classmates about trains, something he's loathe to do because children have been major tormentors.
I can't help but think there may have been one or two too many characters in THE STATION AGENT. At one point, Olivia's need for social isolation exceeds that of Fin's. The two revolve around each other like a double-star, and the changes each effects in the other is the true core of the story. The persona of Joe is nonetheless endearing, although understanding his role as an ostensible adult may be hard to picture unless one sees him as essentially a little kid at heart.
Early on, there's an amusing sequence involving film shot by a ""train chaser"", which gives new meaning to the concept of ""home movies"" and compels the real-life audience to marvel at the eccentricity of some obsessions.
Thirty minutes before viewing this film, I'd finished watching THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS, an emotionally intense film on a profound subject. THE STATION AGENT, a comparative lightweight in content, perhaps suffers in its close proximity to the former. However, the latter does illustrate some truths; it's difficult for Man, an inherently social animal, to become an island, and that same Man can be thoughtlessly cruel towards the physically challenged.
Shot in a mere 20 days in rural NJ, THE STATION AGENT is a beguiling, well-acted, lushly photographed film worth a look if you can find it in the local art house to which its release will likely be exiled. Interestingly enough, the late 19th century train depot had been totally refurbished, and had to be re-dilapidated, so to speak, for the needs of the production.
Note: This film was seen at a pre-release screening sponsored by the distributor, Miramax.",1064102400,37,3220,4.931860036832412
