8307797,3,B001H4N6CW,"This was a bit of a surprise with Robert Ryan and Anthony Quinn, two excellent actors, teamed together as girl chasing, hard drinking, deep diving salvage diving pals in the Caribbean.  Not the kind of movie you would usually see them in.  Pretty standard plot, two fun good guys find out about a million dollars of gold, one goes astray for awhile and then they come back together and stop the bad guys.  A regular storyline used many times and probably would rate two stars if it wasn't for the caliber of talent in the film.  All do a good job, but again held back by the plot.  Enjoyable and good escapism piece.  Fine way to pass some time, worth a watch.",1426118400,,660,4.368852459016393
8307798,4,B001H4N6CW,"Two salvage divers (Robert Ryan, Anthony Quinn) arrive in Jamaica at the behest of an insurance company who hope to locate a ship that was lost in a hurricane ..... and carrying over a million dollars in gold! What, at first, seems a simple salvage job turns into a tale of greed, double crosses, romance and voodoo. Although directed by Budd Boetticher, don't expect much. This isn't one of his complex, layered westerns with Randolph Scott but an uncomplicated exotic Saturday matinee Technicolor adventure. It's the kind of movie where you can only pay half attention to and still get everything that's going on. Ryan seems adrift here, he's the kind of actor who needs a part with some teeth. As a generic action hero, he seems uncomfortable and it shows. Quinn fares better as Ryan's hard drinking, two fisted, skirt chasing partner. For a film shot on the Universal backlot, the Universal art department does a decent job of turning it into the Caribbean. With Mala Powers and Suzan Ball as the romantic interest of Ryan and Quinn respectively. Also with Woody Strode, George Mathews, Karel Stepanek, Hilo Hattie and Lalo Rios.

The Koch Media DVD via Germany is a nice transfer with muted colors. Soundtrack is in both English or German. The German subtitles are easily disabled.",1373846400,,1286,4.872146118721461
