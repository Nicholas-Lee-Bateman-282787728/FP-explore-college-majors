2625949,4,B000H4JH4Y,"I agree with another reviewer that they are packing in many new characters.  Personally, I like Sauders very much, and I'm glad to see him in the field, instead of cooped up in the lab.  Sofia is another good character, although her ""departure"" was so little mentioned, it was odd hearing of her ""return.""

I don't care for what they're doing with Grissom and Sidle, however.  In so many episodes he made it clear that he wasn't interested in her romantically.  At the end of ""Butterflied"" he goes into quite a bit of detail as to WHY he can't be with her.  He is still her supervisor, he writes her performance reviews, dictates her raises and (to some extent) controls her career.  That's a relationship that usually prohibits any romantic connections!  Ah, but this is television, not the real world....

This sudden capitulation to his emotions is hard to fathom.  What changed to make him throw aside his reservations?  Are we now to be burdened with seeing Grissom's ""mid-life crisis?""  He has always been portrayed as devoted to the truth, and in holding others to his high ethical standards.  Now, suddenly, all bets are off and his own behavior is questionable, to say the least.

I think they've made a mistake in this plot line.  We'll see where it goes, but if Ecklie gets wind of their affair, he could cause serious problems for them both!  He's been itching to fire Sara for 3 years!",1159228800,5,1398,4.644897959183673
2625950,5,B000H4JH4Y,"CSI is great and Downloading was very easy.  This is my fourth video, and I've only had problems with one, and Amazon quickly walked me through fixing it.  Gotta agree with A. Huck on the DSL, though.  While it's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great.",1158796800,3,272,4.510204081632653
2625951,4,B000H4JH4Y,"Just got done watching the show and it was awesome. Of course I had to download the tool, how else do you get started? Once it downloaded it worked very well and the video was right there to watch when I was ready. Note to self get cable, DSL is a slow download but it worked great and the picture quality was awesome. No commercials!

I didn't have any troubles installing it on my computer and the help tool walked me through it.",1158710400,4,431,4.192771084337349
2625952,3,B000H4JH4Y,"I found Season 6 of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation to be subpar.

I think this season was marred by several problems.

First, it's becoming apparent that there are too many characters on the show. In recent seasons, Greg Sanders, Hodges, and Sophia have been added to the regular cast. This made this season's shows look more like exercises in stuffing as many characters into one episode as possible. I spent many times counting how many scenes Warrick had compared to Nick during this season.

Second, trying to fit all the actors into the show practically eliminated any character development this season.

Third, many of the episodes, especially the one about a cult, were not top-notch. They looked like a good first draft of a CSI episode but didn't have the complexity of the earlier cases.

Fourth, some of the episodes went for laughs and light-heartedness too often. The one exception is the wedding episode, which was absolutely hilarious.

All in all, I'd recommend the earlier seasons of CSI over this one.",1158537600,15,1019,4.9298245614035086
2625953,3,B000H4JH4Y,"The 6th season was a good season but it seems to lack the character development that other seasons had. The cases were also not as exciting as previous seasons. There are still plenty of good episodes in season 6 but unless the next season has better episodes, CSI could have hit its peak and it shows in this season.",1157587200,4,317,4.389830508474576
2625954,5,B000H4JH4Y,"I am a little biased when it come to CSI. OK Maybe addicted is a better word when it come to CSI for me.  With each season getting better. My favorite episode for season 6 was ""Gum Drops"".  This cast rocks on this show and ""Gum Drops"" was George Eads (Nick) best so far.",1156118400,8,270,3.9814814814814814
2625955,5,B000H4JH4Y,"Each season seems to get better and better.  I don't know how it keeps getting more and more adictive, but they keep the story lines fresh and interesting and there is just the right mix of crime investigating and insights into the characters lives.
In the first episode, we learn that Warrick got married due to the realisation that life is so short (after what happend to Nick in season 5 finale).  This is also the first episode where we see all the team back together.  You also start to see how Nick's kidnapping has really affected him - in particular how freaked out he got when he finds a beatle crawling up his arm and in a following episode how he's a little reluctant to enter an underground bunker.
Poppin Tags was one of the best episodes in this season.  Obie Trice featured in it (uncredited as the singer) and was good, but it was a change of pace for the show.  Also I loved Gum Drops where a little girl left behind clues after being kidnapped and that helped get her found alive.  Very clever writing happening.
This is a fantastic season, and with a detectives life in the balance at the series finale, it will definately keep you wondering.  And we are left to wonder what to make of Sara coming out of the shower in a robe and moving close to Grissom who is in a chair in a bedroom, while smiling seductively to him.  Have they just slept together?  She tells him that she's not ready to say goodbye and they look at each other like they've just begun a new relationship.  I cannot wait not only for the next season to begin, but to get this season on dvd.  It's brilliant and one of their best seasons to date.",1155168000,8,1633,4.321311475409836

2626115,5,B000H4JH4Y,"When I started watching CSI Las Vegas, I had doubts about whether I would like this series; I loved CSI NY where I just happen to
reside but  I don't have much interest in visiting Las Vegas and can't imagine how I could like the place.  I don't gamble, drink or like
night clubs though I might be interested in the Eiffel tower and the Venice sets.  But I have been to the REAL Eiffel tower, a sight to
behold, and the city Venice doesn't really interest me as far as visiting it.  Still, they look fabulous in the city of L.V. and if I ever go
there, those would be the first thing I would visit.  But this series really has turned me on; I never expected that Las Vegas would have
much crime; it is a relatively small city compared with NY or Chicago.  But behold, I am hooked  on it, and being retired, I sit home
and watch these episodes one after another.  I bought seasons 1 thru 13 (14 too  expensive right now) from Amazon and am
impressed both by the good story telling, fine musical background (Important for setting the mood) and an amazingly outstanding
cast and absolutely first rate photography.  There are some very somber and sometimes tear jerking moments and have some
similarities to CASTLE and BONES programs but with less humor.  Still, the human relationships between the characters and
the rest are really well done;  I think W. Peterson is outstanding as the Boss with the sexy Cathy and Sarah playing along really
well.  Since the first season there has been a bit more suggested romance and humor added to the series; note the story about
the werewolves and then there is the one I really like titled ""RASHAMAMA"" about rather nasty mother who gets her comeuppance!!  There is so much going on, so many plots and subplots that one cannot begin to describe much.  But CSI series are probably the most imaginative  (and sometimes gruesome!).  I wish they would bring CSI NY back.  Poor Cathy seems to
have no luck with men, first her ex Hubby is murdered, Her father murdered just as she was beginning to understand him and
then this other  CSI guy from NJ (figures!!) who she seemed to like until he got murdered.  I hope she finds someone while she
is still hot.  Sarah seems to have something going with Petersen (Grissom) maybe.  Still with all the mayhem going on in L.V. I
wonder how safe the  city is.  NY looks safe compared to L.V.  Good going, producer guys (and gals)!!  This shows make such
dopey shows as Rizzo & Isles or Cold Justice look pathetic.  So enjoy!!!  And guess what?? No Dr Sweets!!",1403827200,2,2532,4.481400437636761

Be sure and watch all the episodes she and Grissom appear in: ""Slaves of Las Vegas"",
""Lady Heather's Box"", ""Pirates of the Third Reich"", ""The Good, the Bad and the Dominatrix""

2626146,1,B000H4JH4Y,"The fully reunited team is back together working the trailer park fire in BODIES IN MOTION complete with a slow motion stroll into the parking lot. Later Grissom receives a package containing the tape Nick recorded his testament to his parents, Cisco & Grissom. 0n the other cassette, Walter Gordon's statement to the kidnapped C.S.I. is heard, but then on further playback, Gordon is heard conversing with a woman suggesting Gordon had an accomplice. Grissom orders Archie to stay silent on the tape. The team back together, another clue into Nick's kidnapping & what do we get? NOTHING!

ROOM SERVICE had cases involving victims of divergent social classes, struggling immigrant hotel worker Samay Tao & rich actor Julian Harper. The episode begins with the slow, haunting cover of TEARS FOR FEARS MAD WORLD by Gary Jules. The song creates a funeral dirge for both men. Samay Tao was murdered in cold blood, Harper on the other hand was the victim of his own vices, auto-erotic asphyxiation, drugs & wanton sexual perversion. The poor, the rich, the struggling, the well-to-do. The class dichotomy. NOTHING!

SECRETS & FLIES-Grissom gains some character development in his quest to disprove the entomological findings of friend & former colleague Mark Thayer. Grissom is brought in by Ecklie & McKeen because the murder victim was McKeen's goddaughter making the case personal. Grissom using his expertise as an entomologist to disprove Thayer's testimony & it is that testimony that gets the killer convicted & Thayer arrested on charges of evidence tampering & obstruction of justice. In this very episode we are introduced to new DNA technician Wendy Simms(Liz Vassey in her debut). The B-plot is convincing for it involves surrogacy, Catherine's support of stem-cell research & pro-choice activism. NOTHING!

STILL LIFE-the return of Kelly Gordon & the continuance of the Kelly/Nick dynamic. No commentary from George Eads or Aimee Graham which brings us to DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL, the direct sequel to GRAVE DANGER & what tied up the loose ends in the Gordon case discovered in BODIES IN MOTION. The victim is Walter Gordon's attorney, discovered the accomplice heard on the tape Grissom kept under wraps. Kelly Gordon is a suspect, but cleared then nailed because the attorney had stolen the inheritance Walter Gordon bequeathed to Kelly. Nick also discovers the tape. DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL was the final chapter in the Nick Stokes kidnapping storyline & what was covered in that episode? NOTHING! John Saxon was interviewed for the Season 5 DVD Special Feature C.S.I. TARANTINO STYLE but Walter Gordon ends up killing himself to take Nick's whereabouts to the grave. Kelly Gordon on the other hand became a recurring character. No commentary or interview on the Season 6 Special Features from Aimee Graham who like Saxon was brought into GRAVE DANGER from a past working relationship with Tarantino.

KISS KISS, BYE BYE-the Special Guest Star turn of 0scar winner Faye Dunaway as Las Vegas scion Lois 0'Neill. Also the only episode with Catherine's parents, Sam Braun & Lily Flynn together. Braun's first time seen on the show since GRAVE DANGER, with his relationship with Catherine still colored by the events of INSIDE THE BOX. Braun & Lily have rekindled their romance. Character development on a large scale, but it is the casting of Faye Dunaway that garners the most note but no commentary from Faye Dunaway or interviews. NOTHING! This furthers the precednt of BIG NAME, no DVD notice.

PIRATES OF THE THIRD REICH-the return of Lady Heather, also the first Lady Heather episode written by the man who created the character in Season 2's SLAVE OF LAS VEGAS, the much slighted Jerry Stahl. The victim is Lady Heather's daughter Zoe Kessler. The episode deals with themes of Nazism, medical experimentation, the twists & turns of the Lady Heather/Grissom relationship. No commentary from Melinda Clarke, William Peteron & Jerry Stahl.

As was the case of UNFRIENDLY SKIES(Season 1) & ANATOMY OF A LYE from Season 2, the DVD ignores a ripped from the headlines episode revisited in I LIKE TO WATCH. Based on the case of fake New York fireman & rapist Peter Braunstein who was convicted & sent to prison in 2005 for his crimes, this episode got the shaft as it did Its predecessors. The events of the real life case on which the episode was based, still fresh in the media's mind. A real life case in the largest city in the United States of America. Braunstein became the subject of an episode of I (ALMOST) GOT AWAY WITH IT! This is taken from the Wikipedia article on Braunstein, In popular culture This case was the inspiration for episode 19 of the 6th season of the CBS television show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation entitled I Like to Watch, which aired March 9, 2006. In this episode, a serial rapist poses as a firefighter, setting small blazes to gain entry to apartments, where he drugs women and sexually assaults them, focusing mainly on their feet. Ripped from the headlines episodes by their very nature warrant commentary.

SPELLBOUND-the return of Lori & Anna Leah from Season 1's EVALUATION DAY. Shonda Farr & Keri Lynn Pratt were back as the crazy girls who get caught up in other peoples crimes. Greg's fascination with the occult. Lori & Anna Leah were never expected to be seen again but Jacqualine Hoyt in her writing debut worked a masterstroke. NOTHING!

RASHOMAMA-a cleverly scripted classic that showed the same case from the perspectives of Nick, Greg, David, Grissom & Sara. Witty, full of gallows humor, the brief scenes in sepia tone & black & white made for a different kind of episode. NOTHING!

BANG BANG & WAY TO GO-well I will just copy & paste from my earlier post on the subjugation of Paul Guilfoyle.......0f all the actors that have suffered from the lack of or misplacement of commentary, it's Paul Guilfoyle. He first got screwed on ELLIE(Season 2). The very first episode focused on Brass included commentary from Gary DOurdan & Anthony Zuiker. Left out, the 2 MOST IMPORTANT ACTORS IN THAT EPISODE, Paul Guilfoyle & Nicki Lyn Aycox. We meet Ellie, we also learn Ellie is not Brass's biological child. Very little Grissom, very little Catherine, BUT A LOT OF BRASS. Then HOLLYWOOD BRASS became another snub. Brass puts his career on the line to rescue Ellie who has now sunk into prostitution. Brass has no reason to care 1 way or another about Ellie, but he STILL remains her father. We learn the identity of Ellie's real father-disgraced Newark, New Jersey detective Mike 0'Toole. He still cares & fights overwhelming odds to save her. Then Season 6 rolls around, BANG BANG, when Brass in an effort to save the life of a hostage, is shot in the line of duty. These events dovetail into the season finale WAY TO GO, with Grissom as holder of Brass's medical power of attorney, has to debate whether or not to pull the plug. Brass is in critical condition, the odds, not in his favor. Grissom calls Ellie to have her return to the city to be by her father's side. BANG BANG also featured writing from creator Zuiker who had not written for the show since cowriting GRAVE DANGER at the end of Season 5. WAY TO GO had the entire team rallying around Brass, their sole focus being his life, their friend, their family. The DVD producers decided this compelling storyline was undeserving even though WAY TO GO ended with the burgeoning romance between Grissom & Sara. Who doesn't agree that Brass has had very little attention paid to him? Guilfoyle, Teal Redmann & Jerry Stahl who wrote WAY TO GO should have all been in a studio recording their comments, but the DVD producers seem to have no regard for character development.

The former brought Anthony Zuiker back to writing for C.S.I. since the frequently aforementioned GRAVE DANGER, the latter by the repeatedly ignored Jerry Stahl. 0n the both episodes commentary was warranted from Guilfoyle, Redmann, Stahl, Zuiker & Carol Mendolsohn. Both times, NOTHING!!!!!",1365724800,,7966,4.915985130111524

Back home, I used to watch episode by episode, and not even everything...so I missed a lot and really wanted to have all of them together, now that I do, I'm glad.
However, I couldn't imagine such a famous serie wouldn't have any subtitles in English or in Spanish. And it only offers two audio languages options: in Enlgish and in Spanish. I mean back in a lot of non-English or non-Spanish countries they watch CSI Vegas doubled in their own language. I would have expected it to have at least a French Option audio language + all three subtitles, but I was very disappointed when I found out that there is not any subtitle unless you watched with a TV that has captioned option, too bad!
Apart from that, the overall quantity of the serie is great, and I hope they will add in the future more languages and subtitles, because I believe that a TV serie with that reputation should allow anyone around the world to watch it! I received my shipment on time and in very good condition!

All I can say is that my favorite characters are even better this time around, with more emotional storylines and personal issues to deal with. My favorite episdoes, by far, of Season 6 are ""Gum Drops,"" dealing with the disappearance of a family of four, and ""Pirates of the Third Reich,"" which deals with the horrendous murder of Lady Heather's daughter.

This season, more than any other before it (with, perhaps, the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/C-S-I-Crime-Scene-Investigation-The-Complete-Fifth-Season/dp/B000B8IA08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">C.S.I.

I realize not everyone will have this type of reaction, but I do want to stress that Season 6 seemed to really pull on the heartstrings.

2626284,5,B000H4JH4Y,"I have always love C.S.I. Scene Investigation (the original, Las Vegas team) since I watched the DVD of season 1 a few years ago. As I live in Austria and all English programmes are dubbed in German (I can't understand a damn thing!), I had to watch DVDs to keep up with USA TV shows.

For me, no other TV series can compare to the original CSI series. I've seen spin-offs (CSI Miami & CSI NY), copy-cats TV series (Navy CSI, Coldcase, Numbers, etc.) and still CSI Crime Scene Investigation beats them all.  All the casts are excellent actors/actress and none of them ever tried to overwhelm the story with their own oversized egos (like that stupid vain guy with sunglasses on CSI Miami) despite 6 seasons of TV fame.

I like Grissom the best of all, because of his quirky love for bugs and insects, for his intelligence and professionalism, his obvious affection & subtle love for all his team members and his great one-liners in the beginning of every episode, before the song comes on. His one-liners are always spot-on and funny.

I find the 6th Season as interesting as always - all the bloody, disgusting, gruesome, funny, weird, and sad cases. Dwelling a bit into the private lives of the CSI teams also helped to strengthen the stories and characters, made me symphatize with them more, making them more human. By the time I reached the last episode where I saw Grissom and Sara got together, I was stunned. I am happy that they finally got together, but I wonder if their romance will complicate the storylines in the 7th Season.

But one can feel the troubles the writers have to go through to get a fresh approach to an old problem: the stand-alone episodes. The nature of the series demands that a problem must be solved in one or two episodes, and we go along with that. But the nice thing about CSI was that the writers could insert here and there items that showed you the characters were not only real but also growing. And that is what I'm missing somewhat in the 6th series; they stand still. They do their job, and quite well, but they're getting a bit mellow. Gosh, even Ecklie turns out to be human. I'm missing somewhat the conflicting stuff our own lives are built upon. But the acting and the scenery is still superb, and a a whole the series are still Quality TV, somethinh sorely missed in most of the other (crime) series.",1173916800,,906,4.366863905325443

2626354,4,B000H4JH4Y,"Seven years ago, ""CSI"" was ahead of its time. Seven years ago, ""CSI"" was revolutionary for its study of a science most thought of as gibberish. The risk CBS took by placing it on air, in a coveted time slot, was groundbreaking, and even more so by the positive response they were given. Now, nestled in the comforts of a soundstage on the Universal Lot, it appears the Powers That Be have become complacent, lazy, and smug. They have a phenomenon on their hands, and they no longer feel the need to take risks; instead they have let their success go to their heads, as well as their pocketbooks. However, that is a review best left for the release of the Season Seven DVDs, because I am sad to say, ""CSI"" in its seventh season has jumped the shark, which can only mean that season Six was the last of the Great ""CSI"" Seasons.

""CSI"" Season Six started off strong, promising a lot even within the opening shot of the premiere-- when the entire team joins back together and proudly saunters side by side on their way to a new investigation. All of the original stars of the show are back, as well, which is unheard of for such a long running serialized one-hour drama on network television. And this season provided an insight into the characters that never was before: sure, we knew all about Catherine's screwed up family-- a deadbeat (turned just plain dead) ex-husband, a daughter headed for trouble, a mobster/murderer father-- but now we learn about the others, each one back with a slightly new and possibly improved outlook after one of their own (Nick) almost lost his life in the previous year's season finale. We finally hear Catherine admit her attraction to Warrick outloud; Warrick has made the insanely impromptu decision to marry a woman no one even seemed to know he was dating; Nick, someone who connected as emotionally to his cases as Sara, actually has to be pulled back emotionally by Sara when he starts to look at a victim as not just a body; and Grissom not only beds Lady Heather but also finally gives into seasons of Sara's whiny advances.

The storylines also got kicked up a notch, with ""Dog Eat Dog"" looking at competitive eating and a genetic disease called Prader-Willi Syndrome; ""Pirates of the Third Reich"" dealing with Nazi mentality; and ""The Unusual Suspect,"" which is the ultimate in sibling bonds when a twelve year old genius claims she is actually responsible when her average brother is on trial for murdering a meanspirited but popular classmate. But the clear stand out episode(s) are the two-story arc ""A Bullet Runs Through It"" Parts 1 and 2, which open with the most expensive teaser in television, in which three police cars chase and then take part in a shootout with four suspects in a lower class area in Las Vegas. Needless to say, race, inter-squad politics, and the media are all issues tackled here, when the CSIs are forced to investigate two of their own in the fatal shooting of a rookie uniformed officer who was caught in the crossfire. This episode also brings Hodges into the field for the first (and only) time, which is an obvious laughable moment.

Season Six is not innocent of dabbling in gimmicks and kitsche, though. Some episodes preach more than the typical Gris-isms (one-liners), but still do it subtley (""Room Service,"" for example, which shows that no matter how much you have in life, you're all the same in death). It also takes a page out of ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent""'s book in the episode ""Killer,"" in which we watch the crime happen and know who the perpetrator is from minute one of the show. And in ""Rashomama"" (yes, a concept stolen from a classic film), we see the crime scene multiple times, told through the eyes of the individual investigator telling his or her side, therefore giving the crime multiple personalities, so to speak.

Season Six is not the best season by any means, but it still sticks close enough to the original formula that made it the most successful show on Thursday nights, on CBS, week after week. It has not grown stale: it continues to challenge its viewers, as well as shock them (and of course, make them squeal, as the special effects become more gruesome with time), and it never disappoints.",1165968000,4,4212,4.672506738544475
2626355,5,B000H4JH4Y,"CSI Las Vegas is the show that yields the true goods and its two spin-offs have not even come close to mirroring the quality of this stellar show. Season 5 was a good season (oh, heck... all of them were great...) but Season 6 was the one with the stories that seemed to affect our favorite CSI's more than before. Nick is still recovering from his tramatic expierience being burried alive and nearly eatedn alive by bugs and throughout the first half of this season, you see the effects it all has on him. His ordeal gets tied up midaway in ""Daddy's Little Girl"" which also features an intriguing investigation of a young woman who seems to have really bad luck with men... as in they either die or flee...

Warick gets married and in ""Bodies in Motion"" what viewers suspected for a while comes into fruitation as Catherine reveals that she has fantasized about him and his marraige makes that ""fantasy"" null and void.

Catherine gets a little closer to her ""father"" even when he becomes a suspect in a bizarre mob-like murder investigation in ""Kiss-Kiss, Bye-Bye"" which also features a lavish performance by the stunning Faye Dunaway.

Grissom gets a blast from the past when a DOA turns out to be the estranged daughter of none-other-than Lady Heather in ""Pirates of the Third Reich"" and has more hard impacting moment with her before the episode ends.

Sara shines in all the episodes because she has always been so knowledgable and smart but she gets a moment to oppose Nick in ""Gum Drops"" when he insists that a possible victim could still be alive and Sara inists that his own kidnapping expierience may be impairing his judgement. It is one of the finer episodes of this season... and it has some pretty neat twists.

The two part ""A Bullet Runs Trhough It"" stood out the most for me because it is one of the most heartbreaking episodes I've seen in a while. Sophia and Brass are being investigated for the possible ""friendly fire"" death of one of their own and the conclusion to this stunner brought me to tears and made me feel a whole different degree of respect for bith Sophia nad Brass.

""Still Life"" is another episode that hits close and hits hard. A mother believes her son has been kidnapped and when he turns up in another ""loving"" family... of course it would not be CSI if there weren't a few boggeling twists...

The emotional ""Up In Smoke"" was another stunner complete with several twists throughout... as the CSI's investigate a charred body in a chimney only to be informed by Catherine and Warick that the tenant was being investigated for the disapearance of a teenage girl nearly a year earlier. Catherine (who has always been my favorite CSI) takes this case personal as she seriously believes that this man murdered that girl.

""Rashomama"" finds the CSI's investigating a murdered ""mother-in-law"" wat a wedding and what makes this episode shine is the different takes on what happened after Nicks car (and the evidence) is stolen. Seeing Sara's view on marraige is pretty funny... and sequence when they try to think back is hilarious as the scen seems to mesh with their views of marraige. Who knew Nick was so romantic?

Of course, the season finale ""Way To Go"" is another shocked as one of their own is in a life or death struggle after being shot during a hostage situation. It is a touching episode and another one that had me on the verge of tears. I really got a better feel for Brass and Grissom's friendship in this one.

So... great season... lots of good stories and this DVD set is loaded with interesting extras. Even after six seasons this show is still as potent to me and I hope it has the steam to continue on for a little bit longer. If you own the other seasons, this is certainly a plus to have with your collection. I am not at all disapointed with this purchase.",1164067200,7,3814,4.5791788856304985
2626356,5,B000H4JH4Y,"This hit series sixth season will probably be most remembered for its cliffhanging sequence in which we find out just how close Grissom is to one of his staff members.  Hints are evidenced throughout the season so it's not really a surprise, but effective.

William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger seem to be less visible during this season, leaving much of the work to the talented co-stars:  George Eades, Gary Dourban(whose character ties the knot); Jorja Fox, Louise Lombard, Paul Guilfoyle (exceptionally good this season); Eric Szmanda and Robert David Hall.  There are some clever stories this season including takes on werewolves, eating disorders, gang killings, etc.  There are also some nice guest turns from Oscar winner Faye Dunaway, Veronica Cartwright and Currie Graham.  The background on forensics continues to be fascinating and even though GRAY'S ANATOMY is getting more viewers this season, there's still millions of folks still fascinated with Grissom's Gang.",1163721600,9,979,5.407894736842105

Grissom and Sara are together....FINALLY!!! It took them six years to reveal their feelings for eachother. I mean come on, they have been flirting with eachother since the first season. All in all, the season had really good episodes. Some of my faves were: Gum Drops, Still Life, The Unusual Suspect, Rashomama(Very Funny), Time of Your Death, Bang Bang, and Way To Go. The whole season was great and I'm so getting it on DVD. I already have seasons 1-5 on DVD and I love them. You MUST watch the show if you haven't yet.",1162598400,5,685,4.276923076923077
2626358,5,B000H4JH4Y,"The sixth season of C.S.I. (six seasons already?) finds the Jerry Bruckheimer-fueled train still rolling.  As the season opens, Grissom (William Petersen) and Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) are back in charge of the forensic teams, as this season delves a little bit more into the personal lives of the team.  Warrick (Gary Dourdan) got quietly married (much to the dismay of Catherine), Nick (George Eads) is still recovering and still haunted from his traumatizing event in the previous season's finale, and Sara (Jorja Fox) has a clue about her past revealed.  The bloody cases of the season involve such cases including a whacked out cult, a dead movie star, and the assorted murdered strippers, husbands, wives, etc.  It's amazing that a prime time ratings darling like C.S.I. still manages to seem innovative, even though there are so many spin-offs and immitators flooding prime time using the formula that this show helped set up (the grizzled, veteran leader, the hunky ethnic guy, the nerdy, young genius, the hot girl in tight clothing, etc.).  By season's end, Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) is in critical condition, and Grissom is given a hard choice to make.  By the final frame of the season finale, you may be a bit stunned, which sets up the current seventh season.  All in all, C.S.I. still manages to pack a punch, and it still tops the immitators in every way, shape, or form.",1162598400,17,1388,4.931330472103005
2626359,5,B000H4JH4Y,"CSI - The Original is still, in my opinion, the #1 Ensemble-cast drama on network TV. Yes, other shows are VERY good, but Vegas, baby; that old girl still turns ya on!

Understand, I'm talking here from the viewpoint of a former TV production specialist, a former police officer, and a hard-core TV watcher. If you add in the fact that I'm a Trekker with NO love for Paramount, and you may see that I'm trying my best to objective here, when I'd really LOVE to lambaste Paramount.

But I can't.

Jerry Bruckheimer has assembled a prduction team that knows where to speed things up, where to slow them down, and where to just let everything develop at a natural pace. They grabbed the best actors for the roles they could find, and keep digging up outrageously entertaining scripts. And then throwing in every plot twist they can get away with.

Several reviewers here have raised the questions of Grissom/Sidle/Heather, Sofia Curtis, and of old lady Catherine Willows. Let's look at each one individually.

The Triangle: Gil and Sara have known each other from 'way back', as it were; apparently (we never get the whole story on it) they either worked together before Vegas, or Grissom knew her from seminars, etc., and when Griggs got nailed in the pilot, Gil called Sara and screamed for help. While their relationship has no business expanding into romance - or even casual sex - while he is her supervisor, it IS understandable. Still, that's an unprofessional affair in all senses of the word, and ONE of them should know better. This establishes a good source of dramatic tension for the series, even though it is highly unrealistic. Lady Heather adds more than a touch of spice to things with her intellect, her profession, and that fantastic figure - even better than Marg's which is saying something.

Sofia Curtis: Sofia adds a necessary bit of soloist action to the Sheriff's Department, by way of a former CSI who is now back in harness as a detective; a female Brass, in effect. In fact, the two of them are an excellent team, providing counterfoils for the Scientist vs. beat cop POV, with one on each side of the coin. Again, excellent dramatic operations, but this time, without the loss of professional realism.

Catherine Willows: So what's wrong with a self-made man who just happens to be one of the best-looking women of ANY age on TV? Yeah, at late-30's - plus, Marg Helgenberger is NOT America's gift to MISS America - although, if anyone besides ME remembers her from China Beach, we could debate that one all night -and I'll take either side of the debate! She still looks good enough for the requisite cleavage-shot each week, and is an accomplished-enough actress to carry the brainy-scientist-with-a-bod schtick. Portraying the character as a former exotic dancer/stripper who got a break and got the Hell out of that racket shows that if you've got the brains, the drive, and the chutzpah, you can still make it in America, is another feel-good shot.

The only down side to the series, in MY opinion, is that it confers a 'magic bullet' aura to Forensics that isn't QUITE accurate, yet. In time, with more fully-funded and fully-database-loaded information, things such as DNA testing, tire prints, shoe prints, AFIS (Automated Fingerprint Identification System, if I'm correct), NCIC (National Criminal Information Center, an FBI project that's over 35 years old and still incomplete, according to most FBI types), and other computerized forensic databases, will make a good Forensics Crime Lab almost foolproof. But for now, there is still just leeway in the system for a slick crook to get away with it. And, as long as TV's Shark is still correct - it isn't about Justice, it's about what 12 people believe - the defense and the prosecution will still have their work cut out for them.

But this is still a GREAT series.",1162512000,4,3853,4.808157099697885

I buy the DVD sets and enjoy them tremendously.  However, there are
two trends I see developing that I don't care for---one, there is
too much Catherine.  We know everything about her kid, her dead
husband, her crook father, etc., and she's really an annoying character.
She makes nasty comments about everyone; she's always being insubordinate;
she goes out with men half her age (let's quit trying to make
her seem like a young chick when she isn't, especially wearing those
skin tight jeans), she is very arrogant, and even though she continually
screws up (loses her camera; blows up the lab in a previous season,
accuses people before she has all the evidence), they made her a
supervisor.  Also, the plot line with Grissom and Sara, while
predictable, is not the greatest.  I think Grissom would be
better off paired with Lady Heather.  There's an idea!  Let's see more
of Lady Heather.  Still, even with the annoying overabundance of the
least likable character (Catherine), the show is one of the best, if not
THE best, on TV (up there with Without a Trace, NCIS and Numbers).  Keep 'em coming!",1159833600,9,1172,4.738916256157635
