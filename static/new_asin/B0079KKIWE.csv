8512887,5,B0079KKIWE,"I was thrilled to finally collect this entire series, as previously I had only been able to find eight episodes released on VHS in the 1990s. Marius Goring is a fun and multi-layered Sir Percy (he also played the character on the radio), and Pat Troughton (better known for his stint as the Second Doctor in Doctor Who) is absolutely delightful as Tony. While some episodes have not aged well in content -- one notorious episode features Goring in yellowface -- overall, the series is very enjoyable. It's interesting to watch these stage-trained actors transition to early television, as the blocking and shot framing is clearly based on stage presentation. Spotting early television appearances by actors like Christopher Lee and Peter O'Toole is an added bonus.

The video quality is better than I expected for a series of this age, though one or two episodes were transferred from 16mm film and do have a grainier texture. The sound is a little fuzzy or uneven in places -- again, to be expected for a 1950s series -- but is better than some other surviving programs. The packaging is minimal, but the reverse of the cover insert includes a full episode list with titles and summaries.",1457308800,,1189,4.828431372549019
