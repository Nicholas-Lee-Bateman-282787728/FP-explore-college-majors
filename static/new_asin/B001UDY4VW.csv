The editing is so bizarre in the beginning, choppy and strange lenses that never appear later in the film, that I thought it would be more stylized as a whole. It's just incredibly disjointed as a film. It seems to me as though the filmmaker wasn't sure what kind of movie he wanted to make. The acting is subpar, at best, but to be fair, the material they were given is strained. Michael Rady is far too good for this place. RUN, MICHAEL. RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN. He is, miraculously, able to make a one dimensional character have many sides. Overall, the film tries to make a statement, but it's muddied as to what that statement is. Unless you're a fan of one of the actors, you can pass.",1470268800,,780,4.3493150684931505
8343355,5,B001UDY4VW,"First off, I came upon this movie because I was searching for movies with Emily Grace in them.  Emily is an up-and-coming star, I believe.  What I got when I began watching this movie was a true masterpiece that grabs you from the very beginning.  I love it because it doesn't tie all of the characters together until about 2/3 of the way through the movie.  When it does though, it's explosive!  And the best thing is that it made so much sense to me when comparing it to my life, in that, so many times in my life I have known someone who has known someone who has known someone.  It is like the branches on a tree.  You may think that you are a branch that is singular and exclusive, but you are still connected to the trunk of that tree, and boy, does that trunk have many other branches!  Watch this powerful movie and you will understand.  There are so many other facets that I could comment on that are in this movie, but I will leave you with that.  This is a ""thinking-person's"" movie, so be prepared to watch it twice to pick up on all the subtleties and nuances, but it will definitely be time well spent.",1291852800,,1116,4.221698113207547
8343356,1,B001UDY4VW,"Not at all original, funny, or interesting. This movie tries so very hard (to the point where it is obvious) to be ""adult"" and handle an array of topics about sex and love. BORING! I've seen better films on LIFETIME, especially that one movie with Fred Savage beating women! In Search of is literally worse than television drama, there is NOTHING racy, over the top, or jaw dropping about this movie except for the smugness that seeps through! This film was a waste of time and somebody's money. Not bad for a community college class project, but other than that, about as intriguing as a monkey throwing feces at the camera! Actually that would have been preferred over the waste of celluloid that, In Search Of, is. If you are over 65, conservative, have lots of cats, love Jesus, don't know a thing about sex, and bored, this movie is for you.",1255564800,,846,4.572368421052632
8343357,5,B001UDY4VW,"This movie was purchased based off an actress that was in another movie I had. I didn't expect too much. But was I wrong or what? It was a very sexual movie I must say and it brings across some positive messages. However, it also brings across some humor in very creative ways, in my opinion. You gotta learn how to see the laughter in it, possibly for some. But I recommend it to those older people who want to see a little different of a movie. I enjoyed it very much.",1244419200,2,470,4.119565217391305
