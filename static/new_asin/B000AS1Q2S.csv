2390883,5,B000AS1Q2S,"In all my years of singing, I have never learned so much in so little time as I did with Renee's vocal class DVD.  Her breathing techniques are unique and contrary to everything I have been taught in the past and they work miracles!!  I am so thrilled to learn such great ""secrets"" and every so often I get the DVD out again for a refresher.  The breathing technique not only lends for a more controlled and effortless vocal performance but also helps to control those performance nerves that strike all of us at some point in our careers.  Another fantastic aspect of this DVD is the section devoted to ""singing with emotion"" and phrasing techniques.  This DVD is a sure bet and is guaranteed to exceed your expectations and take you to the next level no matter where you are starting out!!",1124668800,2,791,4.503496503496503
2390884,5,B000AS1Q2S,"I purchased this DVD a few weeks ago and have been thoroughly amazed at how helpful and effective the teaching methods are.  What has helped me the most is the breathing technique.  My voice is clearer and easier to control.  I'm able to reach notes that I thought were out of my range.  You can watch this DVD over and over and still learn something new to help you improve your singing.  This product is a very professional and valuable tool for singers.  I have been very pleased with my purchase and recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in learning more about how to sing their best.

2390885,4,B000AS1Q2S,"Renee goes straight to the point.  From breathing to interpretation techniques in one entertaining master class.  The footage is not very recent, but it is the information it brings that counts.",1185062400,,194,5.225806451612903
2390886,5,B000AS1Q2S,"I have taken voice lessons from a few different teachers over the years, and you would easily spend the amount of the DVD on just 1 lesson.  You won't find a more economical way to get your vocal lessons.",1149897600,,204,4.230769230769231
2390887,5,B000AS1Q2S,"We would just like to say that the Vocal Master Class was Both very edjucational,and fun. We had the chance to meet with other great people who are interested in the same things we are. This makes conversation alot easier. It was also great to see so many people attend the Master Class. We give The Master Class 5 stars. Anyone who is interested in a music career should attend the Master Class,Regardless of age and/or vocal level.

2390888,5,B000AS1Q2S,"The techniques are amazing, the secrets like phrasing and support have helped me immensely.

Since I bought this Renee Grant-Williams DVD and now have been implementing and using the valuable tips in my singing...

my phone has been ringing off the hook!

It really works.

I have been getting more singing gigs than ever before.

The changes are really subtle and take a little bit of thought, but the tweaking to my singing has been simple and SO WORTH IT!

Renee Grant-Williams is the vocal coach to the stars, and I can see why.  She is awesome in this DVD and I would recommend it to anyone who makes a living singing and wants to make more money!",1125100800,6,652,4.47457627118644
2390889,5,B000AS1Q2S,"It's a great DVD. Renee shares many different ways to improve you singing, with very simple techniques.  I saw an improvement after my very first ""lesson,"" and the best part is others saw it too.  It's a DVD you can watch a dozen different times and learn something new every time. I get to use the same techniques the stars use, and the most amazing thing about it is I have to opportunity to lean them form the comfort of my own living room.  I think that it is a must for singers.",1125014400,3,483,4.172043010752688
2390890,5,B000AS1Q2S,"The Vocal Master Class DVD is a wealth of information for any singer.  This DVD gives you fundamental yet ""critical"" information and tips on how find your voice and make it stand out above the rest.  While music and singing are my passion, I am also a successful business person.  My business success is in large part due to the fact that I seek out the counsel and advice from those who have a proven track record.  I figured if the likes of Tim McGraw and Faith Hill put their trust in Renee I had better take a close look at it.  I bought the DVD and have been absolutely thrilled with the results.  For the price you simply can't go wrong!",1124755200,4,643,4.229508196721311
2390891,5,B000AS1Q2S,"This DVD completely opened my eyes to new vocal techniques that have made a HUGE difference in my singing.  I learned a lot about passive breathing, which has worked wonders in my music; phrasing, and support.  I have sat through other seminars and walked out with a few new tips, but Renee Grant-Williams Vocal Masters Class DVD gave me more than a few things to think about and incorporate into my singing.  YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY IF YOU BUY THIS!!!  I have watched my copy numerous times and it continues to be valuable.  It is a treasure, really... Renee Grant-Williams is a Vocal Coach to some of Nashville's biggest stars, and you can have her in your living room!  Can't beat that!",1124755200,2,687,4.544715447154472
2390892,5,B000AS1Q2S,This DVD has some of the best tips you can get to improve your singing voice. I heard improvement in my voice after the first hour of applying some of the techniques she talks about on the video. No wonder she is credited with training some of the biggest names in the music bizz how to sing!,1124755200,,292,4.140350877192983
2390893,5,B000AS1Q2S,I received the the DVD and have found the information extremely helpful.  The DVD was not only filled with information I was able to put to use immediately...but Rene's humorous anecdotes  and insider stories made it fun to watch as well.,1124668800,,238,4.780487804878049
8079264,1,B000AS1Q2S,"I really don't get where all these ""rave reviews"" are coming from. I have never had lessons, nor sung in choir, and I bought this thinking I could learn to sing. First off, it looks like it was filmed in the 1980s...I couldn't stop laughing at the funny hair/clothing styles and outdated makeup on the women in the audience. Secondly, she spent sooooo much time talking about consonants. Ok, I get it, but is it really worth spending half an hour talking about it? I almost fell asleep. I was really looking for something that I could practice along with. The only good thing I learned was the ""turkey baster"" analogy. Other than that, she spent a whole lot of time bragging about all the ppl she's worked with. I def don't think this was worth $60",1311379200,5,748,4.467153284671533
8079265,3,B000AS1Q2S,"The dvd offers some good reminders about breathing technique, support, resonance and the importance of consonants. I wouldnt recommend it to people looking for a dvd to sing along with, there is little actual singing. Its not earth shattering, but still useful. There are other dvds out there that will give you quality instruction and more of it, for the same price.",1277164800,2,367,4.935483870967742
8079266,5,B000AS1Q2S,"This DVD is a singer's dream come true!  Boy, she has a lot to say!  If you are pursuing a singing career or even just singing as a hobby, this will give you the edge you need to be a cut above the rest!  I saw (well, heard) an immediate change.  The DVD teaches techniques that either a seasoned performer, or a singer in the beginner stages, can greatly benefit from.  I loved the writing it is witty and clever, which keeps you engaged and able to really apply what she teaches.  She really makes you understand what makes a difference in your singing and performance.  I had several `Aha!' moments!  Out of all the vocal coaches I've worked with, none of them have taught Renee's consonant technique.  It can help a wide range of vocal/singing problems, and I believe every singer on the planet would be significantly improved by applying her techniques.",1221523200,,858,4.555555555555555
8079267,5,B000AS1Q2S,"If you want to improve your singing but can't afford lessons, give this a try. It is excellent information and Renee is really engaging. Easy to follow with lots of visuals on how to perform exercises correctly. This video is about technique and breathing - how you sing is up to you. But if you practice the techniques shown, your singing will definitely improve - I know mine has!

Thanks Renee, for a great video. It was worth the price (which was high, on my budget!)",1215561600,,471,4.476744186046512
8079268,1,B000AS1Q2S,"Horrible, talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk. where the hell is the singing ? she clearly did a good job getting people to leave 5 star rating to boost it up. this DVD feels like an episode of Oprah !!!!!!
Is there any DVD out there that teaches actual singing, right from the moment it starts without talking about who taught who, bla bla bla bla bla bla bla.....a DVD that teaches singing to a student who is STANDING UP, not sitting with a note pad !!!!!where the hell is the singing ?????",1212278400,19,502,4.239583333333333
8079269,5,B000AS1Q2S,"Oh my gosh....this dvd is awesome!!  I called to get an appointment with this lady and she is over $200 an hour.  Name a celebrity, and they have had private sessions with Renee.  I can't believe her dvd is so packed full of information and less than $100.  It is a must-have for anyone serious about their singing.  I will definitely be buying more for Christmas gifts.",1192492800,,370,4.462686567164179
8079270,5,B000AS1Q2S,"I'm so happy I found this great DVD, it's exactly what I needed.  The DVD is made for singers with a wide range of experience.  Ms. Grant Williams is clear and concise and has a way of making you feel you are actually attending the Master Class.

The breathing techniques may take a while to learn but most of the others were rather easy to grasp.  What helps is that she  spends more time going through the exercises that need more attention to make sure you have time to understand and apply the idea.  Then if it's something you don't have to practice she just tells you like it is, and moves on.

As far as I'm concerned this is the one and only program a singer needs to get started.",1190851200,3,688,4.206106870229007
8079271,5,B000AS1Q2S,"I really don't understand the negative remarks this product has received here.  I'm absolutely thrilled with the DVD.  Production quality may be a little uneven, but you won't find information like this anywhere else.  I highly suggest you check this product out; this stuff really works!  Renee's techniques are subtle, but are really what separate an average singer from a GREAT singer.  The listener won't necessarily know WHAT you're doing differently, but they will know you're doing something, and they'll sit up and take notice.  I've gotten so many compliments since I began using these techniques!",1188518400,2,606,5.260416666666667
8079272,5,B000AS1Q2S,"At first I wasn't sure this was going to help me out, my problem has always been that people tell me I don't have good inuniciation when I sing.  After watching it several times I must of got it because my band tells me they can actually understand what I'm saying.  Wayd Johnson, Tulsa OK",1186444800,5,289,4.236363636363636
8079273,2,B000AS1Q2S,"We learn a lot about breathing.  I'm a complete novice and have never taken choir and have never sung in public.  However, I like to sing-a-long to opera (at home when no one is listening.) I bought this DVD because I wanted to have some official training before joining the choir at church.  My husband thinks I can sing--but then so do all of those parents of the deluisonal folks trying out for American Idol, right?  I expected voice exercises and actual INSTRUCTION -- But that didn't happen.  Instead, it is full of self-promotion and name dropping of famous clients. I found a much better DVD --the Berkley Method, at a local music store and I recommend it.",1185148800,42,664,4.593220338983051
