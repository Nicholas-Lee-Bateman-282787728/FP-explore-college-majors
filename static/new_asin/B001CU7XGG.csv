8289826,5,B001CU7XGG,"""Perils in Paradise"" introduces viewers to a technique unknown to most (rebuilding beaches), as well as covering a difficult house-moving task in Hawaii.

The beach rebuilding effort involves a Florida town whose 8.5 mile beach was decimated by Hurricane Ivan.  The rebuilding effort is essential to protecting the town from the next hurricane season and restoring its tourist trade.  The task was accomplished for $10 million moving the equivalent of 150,000 truckloads of sand from 75 feet below the surface four miles offshore onto the beach, and then grading it.  Six months 24/7 dredging using a hopper dredge built in 1987 was required; this was preceded by a six months search for an acceptable borrow site.

One thousand horsepower motors pump sand and water up from the bottom through 150' arms lowered to the bottom; the arms have high pressure jets to loosen sand so that it can be pumped to the surface into the dredger's tank.  Thirty-five minutes are required to fill the hopper (contains about 300 truck-load equivalents); the dredger then heads to a pipe connection located one mile offshore where it pumps slurried sand to the beach using a 4,400 horsepower pump.

Pumping out the sand requires about 30 minutes; bulldozer crews then have about two hours to move the sand around and reposition the inlet pipe, as needed.  The task is made more difficult by the wet sand's quicksand characteristics (until it dries out), and the effects of salt and sand on the bulldozers.

""Perils in Paradise"" then turns to Hawaii where the task is to move a 1920s sugar plantation house 58 miles at night over a narrow road.  Viewers gain an appreciation of the difficulty of lifting and moving such a large load, as well as the equipment involved.",1224028800,,1750,4.901694915254238
