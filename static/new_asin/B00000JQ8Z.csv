7913205,5,B00000JQ8Z,"I have always been fascinated over the raw power of the tiger for most of my life. My fascination was stronger for the tiger over the lion. I guess because the tiger is more mysterious and less known. The tiger is the largest, and the most powerful of all the big cats. Hidden World of the Bengal Tiger is very fascinating and will keep the viewer fixed to the television.",1314748800,,372,4.328571428571428
7913206,3,B00000JQ8Z,"I've been to Kanha, else this video wouldn't have particularly interested me: but as a souvenir, it's fine.
Could do with more of a ""storyline"" (e.g. Lions & Hyenas, Mortal enemies) but as a ""general"" film of tigers it's ok.",1009411200,,224,4.625
7913207,4,B00000JQ8Z,"This video is a perfect compliment to ""Land of the Tiger"", which due to a broader scope only touched on the fact that a mother tiger's greatest danger is a male tiger who is not her cubs' father.
We watch  with forest rangers as Lakshmi raises her triplets to sub-adult.  Then,  ominously, the remains of the triplets' father are found - he had been  patrolling territory overlapping Laksmi's and had been killed by another  male.
Then, one shattering day, the rangers find Lakshmi wounded,  presumably at the hands of the stranger male.  As this was natural and not  the work of man (i.e., poachers), they do not intervene.  She then  disappears, and tension rises as time goes by with no sign of her.  Is  Lakshmi alive?  What of the cubs, the hotheaded boys and their more  competent sister?  I'm not telling - watch and find out!  Another gem in  NG's cap.",963619200,4,860,4.589403973509934
