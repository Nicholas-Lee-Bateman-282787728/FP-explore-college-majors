I have been on the hunt for this style ""cartoon"". The stories and plots are simple, but meticulously Executed. Light hearted fun caused by a wily ladybug who likes to get a rise out of her fellow insects. I'll let my daughter watch this forever.

Only available in region 2 and 4, I think.... Play it on the computer if your DVD player isn't multi region.

I would pay cash money for region 1....",1390780800,,495,4.417582417582418
8407236,4,B003W2949G,As  we live in Australia we could not view this until we purchased a new DVD player & had it taken to  Panasonic agents to have it made region free. It would have been easier if it had already been made region free.,1355443200,,215,3.9767441860465116
8407237,5,B003W2949G,"As with all the best Animation, this collection of  short stories will appeal to anyone from 3 to 90!

All of the animation is of insects including flies (usually with spiders trying to trap them), very cheeky Ladybirds racing just about any winged insect (the sound effects are hilarious- the bee's sound like a group of high power Harley-Davison motor bikes!

There are also the very hard working army ants and catapillars with huge appetites.

The series has been used for ""Fill in"" time between programmes by the ABC (Australia) for over a year now. Glad to see it's available to purchase.

I cannot recommend this highly enough. If you like any of the Pixar films, you'll love this.",1287792000,7,687,4.739495798319328
