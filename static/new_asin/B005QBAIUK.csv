4858132,4,B005QBAIUK,"As one of the historians for Paramount Ranch, a historic movie ranch that is now a National Park, part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, I've waited a long time for this movie to be commercially available. Paramount built two very impressive large scale sets representing San Francisco during two different time periods for this movie at the Paramount Ranch. (They are since long gone.) I'm hoping that someday the movie can be restored close to its original running time. It's a shame that they didn't include the really great behind the scenes film footage shot of the making of the movie at the big Paramount Ranch sets that exists. Such a fascinating behind the scenes look at the filming of the movie would have made excellent bonus material. Maybe someday.",1456876800,3,784,4.902255639097745

4858135,4,B005QBAIUK,"Over a 42 year High School teaching career I found this to be valuable resource when studying both US History and Western History.  It was most valuable when combined with primary source material.  I am very glad to have been able to obtain a DVD copy of a West which is no more.

4858136,4,B005QBAIUK,"I've been looking for a good transfer of this classic, big budget Joel McCrea Western for years, with only my DVD-R copy off satellite sufficing. This present issue is a decent one, made from (probably) 16-mm film. It's entirely watchable and acceptable, if not up to the rigid standards of a major entertainment company. Certainly, the film is one of the better Westerns produced in the 1930s. It's a sprawling epic, covering the founding of the Wells Fargo company, continuing on through the War Between the States, and concluding after the war. Outstanding cast, with a special nod to Johnny Mack Brown, who heroically leads a Confederate patrol (and loses his life) during the war sequences. As usual, McCrea stands out---an underrated actor, despite such films as this one, Union Pacific, Palm Beach Story, Sullivan's Travels, Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent, and, in a glorious tribute to the old West (w/Randolph Scott), Ride the High Country.",1362182400,10,952,5.188311688311688

8483090,4,B005QBAIUK,"Bought this movie because it purportedly contained extensive footage of Columbia State Historic Park in California Gold Rush country (but, ironically, shot on a specially constructed set nearby).  Apparently, 18 minutes was cut from movie after its debut in 1930s.  Yep, every minute of the film on the cutting room floor was Columbia.  Very disappointed.  Otherwise, this was a surprisingly big budget, large-scale production largely devoid of historical fact or period correctness.  But, it was nevertheless fun to watch.  Then again, you never could go wrong with Joel McCrea.",1501286400,,579,5.449438202247191
