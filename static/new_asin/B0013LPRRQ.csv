8251777,2,B0013LPRRQ,"There is hardly someone who does not know Jack Lemmon, or who does not bump into one of his movies, sooner or later. If someone should, though, have a urge of knowing him, I'd say they would rather rent one of the above mentioned movies, than buy this DVD.

I suppose this product has Jack Lemmon's fans as target.
Well, for someone who loves him as an actor and would have liked to know a little bit more about him, both as an actor and as a man, well, it is rather disappointing.
As much as the man is brilliant, forceful, quick and capable to squeeze a smile or a tear from even the most hardheaded guy on earth, as dull, weak, slow, and soulless this product is.
Sorry.",1224115200,14,673,4.217054263565892
