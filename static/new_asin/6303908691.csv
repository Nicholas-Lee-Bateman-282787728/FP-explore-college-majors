7855541,4,6303908691,"""The Lady's Not for Burning"" is set in a room in the house of Hebble Tyson, Mayor of the small market-town of Cool Clary, more or less or exactly in the year 1400. The story involves Thomas Mendip, a discharged soldier, and Jennet Jordemayne, daughter of a recently deceased alchemist. The disappearance of Matthew Skips has the town in an uproar and although Thomas claims credit for the deep and demands to be hung, Jennet is accused of witchcraft and may well be burned at the stake. He wants to die, but no one will kill him, while her life is in danger and she wants to live. Of course, the pair will fall in love, in dialogue that represents the most dazzling verbal invention since Shakespeare. Particularly enjoyable is Jennet's soliloquy on how her father managed to turn lead into gold.
I have always thought of ""The Lady's Not for Burning"" as the best Shakepeare play not written by Shakespeare ever since I caught the 1974 PBS production starring Richard Chamberlain and Eileen Atkins as Thomas and Jennet.  Of course, that version of Christopher Fry's play is no longer available, but you can pick up this 1987 version with Kenneth Branagh and Cherie Lungh.  In terms of the performances, I too have a preference for the earlier version, but in terms of the actual script, I have to give this version the nod.  You see, Fry never stopped tinkering with this play, and there are some significant and notable improvements in the second act scene between Thomas and Jennet.  Ironically, I had ordered this film to show my students after we had performed the play and we were all stunned to see that Fry had fixed the ""problem"" we felt we had with the second act.  Of course I could not show them the play before they performed it because it would skew their interpretations, but that should not have prevented me from viewing the tape.  Sigh.  Watch the video, but also make a point of reading the play.",1032825600,18,1913,4.608823529411764
7855542,2,6303908691,"Compared to my memory of the 1974 version with Richard Chamberlain, something illusive was missing from this performance. I wish someone had the 1974 version so I could determine whether the difference is due to Chamberlain's perfomance, Branugh's performance, changes to the script, or my memory.
Update ten years later : I finally FOUND a copy of the Chamberlain performance on tape and it was better than i remembered it. It was definately Chamberlain's performance, but also Eileen Atkins and ALL the other players. Somebody should put a version on DVD.",1005696000,8,557,5.131868131868132
