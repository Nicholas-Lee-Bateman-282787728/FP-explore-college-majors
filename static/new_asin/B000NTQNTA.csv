8181363,3,B000NTQNTA,"This entire DVD did not contain any how-to or how I do it instruction, but was just him ""speed drawing"" while he rambled over it. ""I already have the vision for this in my head"" while he drew. Even describing his drawing strategies while he worked out this vision would have been much more helpful. This is not the first Gnomon DVD where this has been the case....some are OUTSTANDING, like the ones with Syd Mead...someone who knows his craft so well he can explain his process clearly, intelligently and not hyper sped up so you can apply his strategies to your own works. The Gnomon DVDs seem to be hit or miss, but for the price of them....they should be more hit than miss. Also, he opened this intro in a gas mask and full costume...kinda cool, except that he kept his gloves on and the same gas masky weird voice while he drew. Perhaps he is disfigured or this is just his Schtick, but it was weird, creepy even. You may not think so, but I thought it was worth mentioning.",1387065600,2,980,4.360655737704918
