8090323,1,B000BP4PW8,Amazon should really pull these.  I was lucky that the dude that sold me mine took it back (I think he was afraid that I was going to rat him out).  DON'T buy these... the new boxed set is much better and not much more expensive.,1199577600,2,229,3.9565217391304346
8090324,1,B000BP4PW8,This is a bootleg.  The pictures are scanned and poorly reprinted.  Save your dollars.,1158883200,2,86,5.071428571428571
8090325,5,B000BP4PW8,"This is the China official release Version, not a bootleg or illegal copy! It is in english with chinese subbing, just have to turn the subbing off before the show starts.  Great for the price, but you don't get the Sentinals.  You do get the collectrs box and a 25th anv. keychain with the UNSpacey logo.",1157673600,4,305,4.428571428571429
8090326,1,B000BP4PW8,"This set is NOT an official release of Robotech, this is a Hong Kong Bootleg set.  Don't waste your time or money, get the official sets from ADV.  I can't believe how many of these anime bootleg sets are showing up on amazon these days.",1135209600,4,237,4.2444444444444445
