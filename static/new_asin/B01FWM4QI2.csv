7752012,5,B01FWM4QI2,"The filmmaker, facing financial hardship and fearing possible homelessness, decides to face his fear and take a roadtrip ($?) to explore homelessness in different cities across America.  He interviews an interesting mix of homeless people, all of whom seem to express themselves well and who have good reasons for being without a home and with little to no money.  My heart went out to many of them.  Some I would have invited into my home without hesitation based on the way their stories were presented.  The film goes far to humanize homelessness and erase the societal stigma that keeps many from personally reaching out to help.  I was glad to see advocates for the homeless interviewed also and the many cities trying new methods of dealing with the problem.  One city, Portland, OR, is mentioned, and having visited recently, I was informed by my host that the mayor is giving great leeway about not enforcing laws against the homeless given the current economic situation in the US.  I wish to thank the filmmaker for taking the time out of his financially stressful life to make and share this film with all of us.",1477526400,3,1123,4.787564766839378

7752017,3,B01FWM4QI2,"Working for a local non-profit in GA we deal with homeless that mostly have mental and addiction problems. This film-maker's perspective tries to differentiate between the crazy homeless and ones who are not. To be honest-many of the people he interviewed were bordering on the line of insanity. If most of them stay on the streets,then they, too will have serious mental issues. Overall I thought it was a good movie-would love to see  those people he interviewed in a year.",1470960000,4,475,4.864197530864198
7752018,1,B01FWM4QI2,"The stories were great but for some reason the guy's attempt to pretend to be homeless bothered me. No one, unless you have been, will ever understand what it is to be homeless and pretending like you can is ridiculous.",1470441600,5,219,4.5

8761655,5,B01FWM4QI2,"Wow. Just wow. This guy is something else to go in to the trenches like this.  This should speak to everyone with a roof, a toilet, a sense of safety while sleeping... talk about humble pie. My heart breaks but my resolve to do better as a human being and help somehow has been sparked. My faith in humanity hasn't died yet. Thanks to the movie creator!",1522022400,,353,4.268656716417911
8761656,1,B01FWM4QI2,This movie is nothing but excuses and that proves my theory that we should just kill the homeless.,1514246400,,98,4.5
8761657,2,B01FWM4QI2,"Choosing to ride around in your own car, crashing with friends, and taking a photograph in front of a dumpster,.does not a homeless person make. This is condescending and MEAN - this guy chooses to ACT homeless to suck stories out of sad people. Why? So he can sell it as a movie! This guy is SCUM. He's got a nicer car than I do, but chooses to act homeless. It truly is insulting.",1496016000,,382,4.175675675675675

8761660,5,B01FWM4QI2,Glen gives a lot of information about the non chronic homeless--those who are on the edge of homelessness. The interviews with those folks and with the agencies serving them were excellent.,1484956800,,189,5.129032258064516
8761661,5,B01FWM4QI2,"Yhomless gave an in depth look at the homeless population, which is very diverse.  Glen interviewed folks who have no home and folks and organizations who are helping people without homes.  In addition, he does this while living out of his car as a man without a home and shares his feelings and travails.",1482192000,,305,4.62962962962963
8761662,5,B01FWM4QI2,". The maker of this documentary gave a multifaceted perspective on homelessness, not only through the interviews with the homeless population and the homeless advocates but also through his personal  experiences of being homeless as he traveled from city to city. His personal experiences allowed me to vicariously experience this with him? This  is an insightful, sensitive and thought provoking documentary which changed my perspective of homelessness.",1482019200,,454,5.7611940298507465

8761664,4,B01FWM4QI2,"This has really been a great journey, and I understand all the back-lash, it reminds me back in 2007 when I was walking with my now ex-husband, and we were in Boston, and he was sickened by a homeless person, when I reached out and handed him money.  Never in a million years would I of thought that by 2011, a year after the divorce, I would become homeless.  And still in a way am.  I have my mother to live with, in a room, yes.  Not one week goes by though that I am not reminded by her newly found boyfriend, that this is not your home.  I was such a success story.  In the Air Force by 17, College, etc.  Owned my own home.  The pain I needed to endure is beyond compare, until I listen to these stories, and I know ""We are not alone!"".  I want to make homeless an asset, a commodity, like I learned in college, as if you want to build this hotel, well fine 7-10 rooms support the community.  No Not Communist, no not Christian, just human, let us just start there!  A few weeks ago, my ex screamed at me on the phone and stated what are you a heroin addict?  It is wrong and it hurts, We are Proud humans, I served my country, and no We have a Fiat System of finances and this is the outcry of it's failure!  I found when he on this video was being about his journey, dude to go from talking to some level of Directors to how you pee in a cup PLEASE that was WEIRD!  Thank you for getting the message out, a bit off the cuff, just well deserved and what great folks you got to speak to!  May this inspire me and a lot of folks to CHANGE things!",1479340800,,1551,3.958064516129032
