Es un gusto tambien verte por video, tus imagenes son fantasticas, las ediciones son esxelentes. Solo quiero decirte: Don't Stop... y Que siga la tradicion... por siempre.

1389703,4,B000053GTH,"Gloria on stage is always fantastic. Flashy colors, pounding rhythms - all the things you expect fron Gloria on stage. For those who have avoided her Spanish albums, you are missing some of her best. Also some numbers have been done by her in English, and so are recognizable. A real treat for all fans.",1151971200,,303,4.527272727272727

1389705,4,B000053GTH,"I have the Atlantis concert DVD.  It is great.
I thought I might like this DVD too.  So I read the reviews on this site.
Unlike one of the other reviewers who said the sound quality was poor I found it to be exceptional.  I am talking about the Dolby 5.1 track.  This DVD really makes use of the back speakers!
One or more reviewers said the volume was low.  I found the volume level to be perfect on 12 of 13 songs.  Only one needed a boost of 2 clicks on my remote--it was one of the concert videos.
The other reviews said the image quality was outstanding.  I found the image quality was outstanding on about 2/3 of the DVD.  Other segments were sort of hazy.  But I think the haziness was intended.  It looks like it was to create a dream-like effect.  I think I'd prefer all of it to be nice and sharp though.  That being said, I am not disappointed with how it was done.
Like one of the other reviewers, I agree having both English and Spanish subtitles is a terrific idea.  I can sort of follow the Spanish subtitles (maybe 30-50% of it) since I know some Portuguese.
Four of the songs from the Atlantis DVD reappear on this DVD.  Three of them have entirely different imagery to go with them so that is quite enjoyable.  One is identical to what's on the Atlantis DVD, but at least I get those great subtitles!
Overall, I am very happy with this DVD.",1041292800,5,1358,4.209302325581396
1389706,4,B000053GTH,"Anyone who loves Gloria Estefan will want this DVD. It is a collection of some of her best songs from her Spanish language CD's and others. Some are concert clips, others are music videos. Some of my favorites include ""No Me Dejes de Querer"" featuring some great looking Cuban men and some really hot moves. ""Oye"" is a great dance stage clip. T""res Deseos"" features a carnival scene which is very cute. The highlights are perhaps her duet with Alejandro Fernandez, very romantic and gorgeous (She doesn't look like she's acting here, and who could blame her?!); and Con Los Anos Que me Quedan, a very beautiful black and white 40's montage. This song is truly beautiful and moving, and this treatment is very touching.
In between each item is some ""behind the scenes"" footage. A lot of people are finding this annoying, but I think it's fun.
Now the downside. From a directorial point of view the use of slow motion and jerky camera movements is overdone. Sometimes it looks like the motion is running too slow. I was wondering if something was wrong with the DVD. I do not to make too much of this, the quality is by no means terrible, but the sharpness, color and clarity of the DVD could be better.
Nevertheless, I enjoy this DVD immensely. Gloria is one of my favorite artists, whom I respect enormously for her promotion of Latin music, language and culture. Never marketed as a mere sex symbol or ""babe"", she is very beautiful and enjoyable to watch. With husband Emilio and the best musicians, arrangers around, she has created a musical product which I think will stand the test of time. Moreover, she seems to surround herself with the most beautiful men everywhere she goes!",1040947200,3,1684,4.673400673400673
1389707,5,B000053GTH,"I am reallly fond of this DVD. Most DVD's you never play after you've seen it once. But this one keeps on entertaining because the sunny, happy and inspiring latin music combined with the beautifull colorfull and tastefull images makes it very addictive. It makes you want to go to Cuba or Miami directly, so be warned!
I am a fan of Gloria ever since Mi Tierra. The sweet velvet voice of Gloria sounds incredible with the Spanish sentences. I didn't understand a word of it.. until I bought this DVD. It's really fun singing the songs with spanish subtitles (Karaoke!!) and then change to english subtitles to see the meaning of the words. It's a great way in learning Spanish. ""Oye mi corpe pide salsa!!!""
I must admit that the first time I saw the DVD it was a bit disappointing because I expected all live Spanish live performances like Que siga la tradicion. But after seeing it for the 2nd time and 3rd and 4th I think this concept is more entertaining. The videoclips are a true masterpiece with hot people, beautifull ladies with sweat all over their body and wearing summerdresses while dancing sensual salsa. Or Cuban culture with old men in a white suite and hat performing. Or cuban people dancing in a nightclub. But I want more live performances because what I saw on this DVD makes me want more!!!
Even if you're not a fan of Gloria you must have respect for her comeback after the busaccident. When she sings English it's okay. It's pop and the ballads are for many people nice. But the way she makes the latin music living is really outstanding. Latin music makes me happy, but this DVD combines beautifull images with this happy and danceable music. It really gives an extra dimension to the latin music. Therefore: a must for every latin (music)lovers!!!",1015718400,,1773,4.631746031746032
1389708,3,B000053GTH,Something went wrong with the sound volume on this DVD. I can produce better sound on my PC. GLORIA !!! Aren't you ashamed? It REALLY spoils the fun. If you're a fan and gonna buy this DVD anyway prepare to crank volume to the max level.,1014854400,2,237,4.173913043478261
1389709,2,B000053GTH,"What a disappointment, I have been looking for good artisits' concert & music video performances, with great audio (DS 5.1 or DTS), to play as entertainment on my 160"" (diag.) front projection system. The room is 40' long. The audio is Yamaha DSP (RX-V3000), nine speakers (L, R, LFE; FE-L, FE-C, FE-R; RS-L, RS-C, RS-R).
I like Gloria Estefan. I have 4 of her CDs, and prefer her music in Spanish. I was excited to add this video to my 150 DVD collection.
After watching the DVD's 13 videos with connecting material, I am completely disappointed. I'll likely just sell the video on Amazon used.
(1) More than half of the videos on this DVD have very poor Dolby Surround 5.1, worthless: no imaging, non-dynamic, very flat, very unrealistic, very unsatisfactory. I tried every Yamaha DSP mode, including no effects and standard modes, all to no avail, nothing sounded even tolerable. Actually, the ""standard"" 2-channel Dolby Surround audio is listenable, although pretty ""flat"", especially in such a large-screen system. If a DVD is going to have premium audio (D5.1 or DTS) it should be engineered to high quality, unfortunately this isn't. (Maybe 5 or 6 six of the videos have adequate or good sound engineering on this DVD).
(2) The mini-documentary ""connecting"" footage (with minimal dialogue) between the videos is extremely annoying, offers no value/excitement, is of very low production quality (like a Hi-8 camcorder) with ... audio, and each time destroys any continuity between the videos. It makes it impossible for the viewer to become immersed in the musical experience, as one would expect in a concert video, or a music video collection.
If you really, really love Gloria, and are going to watch this DVD on your normal 35"" television, with 3-channel (or 2ch) audio, then it might be considered ""ok"". The mini-doc footage is still annoying and will prevent you from ever playing the DVD end-to-end as background entertainment for a group/party.
I'm very disappointed. I hope someday Gloria Estefan have a worthwhile DS 5.1 or DTS concert video, with high production value and without the documentary bits stuck inbetween songs. (I do appreciate docu content, as long as it's separately watchable).
(FYI, for comparison, try Luis Miguel ""Vivo"" DTS concert video. It's incredible ... the production, performance, the audio engineering, everything. Completely outstanding.)",999216000,9,2384,5.162790697674419
1389710,5,B000053GTH,"First of all, this DVD includes many videos that you can't see in MTV (at least not here in Europe)... so I was really excited when I saw videos first time watching this DVD, including Cuba Libre, Santo Santo & En El Jardin. Usually I don't buy musicvideo DVDs, because MTV plays the same videos all the time... this DVD really offers something new.
Secondly, how often you can say that the bonus footage is really interesting? Well, this DVD shows that the bonus stuff between the videos can be exciting! It includes footage from Gloria's Millennium Spectacular Concert, her ""Alma Caribena"" concert in Atlantis, backstage footage from studios, photoshoots... yeah! Incredible!
The quality of this DVD is really good. Picture is clear, the menus are very welldone, and the cover picture... well, that's incredible! The only negative thing I have about this DVD is that it doesn't include ""Como Me Duele Perderte"" video, and I can't understand why. But this DVD really is worth the money it costs. If you like latin music and Gloria, this DVD is really made for you... buy it, you won't regret it!
PS. Remember to watch the hottest supersexy ""Oye"" video over and over again!",997747200,3,1173,4.811881188118812
1389711,5,B000053GTH,"I was soo happy to find this video. From her older temas in Spanish, Abriendo Puertas, Tres Deseos to her latest. I was never able to see those videos for my favorite songs, i was so excited to see them and keep them. Including the duets w/ So pra and Alejandro Ferndandez. Could it get any better...???? I love the cuts in between the videos. They are pretty interesting. Definentely a video to add to your collection.",990057600,3,419,4.454545454545454
