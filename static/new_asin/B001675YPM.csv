8261491,4,B001675YPM,"This collection isn't cheap, and it includes less than half of de Antonio's lifetime output (he directed 11 documentaries between 1964 and 1989), but it's about all you can currently get through commercial channels (other than 1972's ""Painters Painting,"" which is also a must-own). The term `radical' gets thrown around a lot in relation to de Antonio, and it adorns this box set, but I've always thought of him more as a believer in the system and a foe to those who would use it to their own ends. Either way, `visionary' is also used often, and definitely applies, as de Antonio was at the forefront of a mid-60's wave of documentary filmmakers who redefined the form. This set includes a nice selection of works from across his career, along with copious liner notes, and the print qualities are strong (if not always in the most appropriate aspect ratio). Definitely worth the price if you're a student of politically-oriented nonfiction film, or if you just enjoy seeing the work of great and underappreciated artists.",1281657600,,1024,4.890804597701149
8261492,4,B001675YPM,A note regarding aspect ratio: Millhouse: A White Comedy is presented in 16:9 rather than 1.33:1 aspect ratio in this set.,1271721600,2,122,4.857142857142857
8261493,5,B001675YPM,"I was first introduced to de Antonio's films in the early '90s, when I was lucky enough to catch ""Milhouse: A White Comedy,"" on CBC television's The Passionate Eye.

My next encounter with de Antonio was his 1964 film, ""Point Of Order,"" which just bowled me over.

Thus began my search for virtually every film de Antonio made. This remarkable collection of four de Antonio films gets you almost half the way there. Included in this set are: (1) Millhouse: A White Comedy (1971); (2) The Year Of The Pig (1968); (3) Underground (1976); and, (4) Hoover And I (1989). In my opinion, de Antonio's true gift was his ability to tell a compelling story through great film editing.

If you're a fan of left-of-center political documentaries, I cannot recommend this collection too highly.",1265500800,4,781,4.813432835820896
