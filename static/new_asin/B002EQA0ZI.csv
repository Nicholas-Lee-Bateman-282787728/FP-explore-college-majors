""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media.""  Please people, research what you are purchasing so you know what you are getting.  Don't buy it and give it a average to below average review when 2 minutes of research would probably disuade you from buying the item in the first place.

Average fights for the hardcore fan.",1261872000,,461,4.884615384615385
8368181,3,B002EQA0ZI,"I got three of this HDNet Fights dvds, all were in poor video condition. The dvd looks like a bootleg and the video looks like one. None of the matches are worth viewing twice. No big knock outs or subs. Checked out the main event on youtube. I have seen a lot better from Melendez and Thomson on other matches.

TO: TROY,(SECOND REVIEW) I give three stars due to the fights not being so good. Even though it was recorded on a DVR system dose not mean the picture needed to be in such bad condition. I have bought movies from amazon which were stated to be recorded from a DVR, which looked a lot better than this tape. Even if the picture was in HD, would not make this any more than three stars.",1255564800,3,697,4.162962962962963
