8464652,2,B005BYBZG8,"I knew this had a low rating, but bought it only because  my niece has a small speaking part.  This story is presented in a bizarre way.  It's generally a short story about Marlon Brando's son, and he often goes into telling stories about his dad.  The portion about the son is utterly boring unless you like seeing his freaky drug-impaired friends who can't understand what they're hearing and frequently interrupt the big story by screaming and pulling out guns because they say they can't believe it.  I hope there's basic truth about Marlon Brando, and if so, then this movie has value for telling us how the guy rose to stardom, then ruined his life.  HOWEVER, While watching this, I had IMDB.com showing Marlon Brando's movie history on my phone and some things don't match.  Marlon Brando was already famous before this movie says he was.",1480809600,,845,4.707482993197279

8464654,5,B005BYBZG8,Ricco Chapa deserves an oscar. However I know that he won't be nominated. Its a great film but way to P.C. incorrect. Very Intense movie the acid scene alone is worth seeing the film for.,1328054400,,187,4.371428571428571
8464655,1,B005BYBZG8,"I saw a title called ""Brando Unauthoriezed"". The description read ""delves into the career of Marlon Brando."" What would you think that you're about to see? Me, too! Well, it's not! It's a cheesy C movie (I gave it ten minutes to change my mind) and not at all what it presented itself to be. If you're looking for a Brando bio, don't look here!",1327276800,,344,4.3076923076923075
