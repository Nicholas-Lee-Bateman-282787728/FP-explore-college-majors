8224737,5,B000WP09PY,"I am not sure what the other reviews are talking about. Did we see the same show?  Of course it's from 2008, says so in the product description. Of course it's about the history of aliens, says so in the title. Folks this stuff is fascinating and the History Channel did an excellent job of producing it. It is the precursor to the more recent and equally intriguing series ""Ancient Aliens"".  Whether you believe it or not, the evidence they examine really makes one consider the possibility. And that is what it intends to do.

You won't find a more well-made introduction into the subject of ancient aliens. It provides a broad stroke, touching on the several, central pieces of controversy and purported evidence that other shows then examine in greater detail. Watch this and you will be filled with a sense of wonder, can be conversant on the topic, and can pick up in the middle of other series without feeling lost.

This is also great entertainment and makes a terrific addition to your DVD library. Highly recommended.",1349481600,3,1027,4.720670391061453
8224738,1,B000WP09PY,"There was a previously released documentary, under the A&E label, titled ""UFO's-The First Encounters""(still available) which is the exact same documentary with one notable difference. Leonard Nimoy narrates the A&E version while the History Channel version (Ancient Aliens) is narrated by someone else (I believe it's the same person who does many History channel docs). Given the choice I'll take the Leonard Nimoy version everytime. Add the confusion with the triple use of the title ""Ancient Aliens"" for 3 completely different History Channel DVD's and this becomes an entirely useless release.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancient-Mysteries-UFOs-The-First-Encounters/dp/B0007ZENWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancient Mysteries: UFOs - The First Encounters</a>",1294704000,15,808,7.09
8224739,3,B000WP09PY,"One of the things that makes life so wonderful is the human mind. And it's ability to ponder questions such as those presented in this documentary. Did ancient aliens visit the earth during biblical--even PRE-biblical times? Why is it that every culture seems to have drawings or stories of saucer shaped objects being viewed in the skies? You cannot say that it was thanks to the media or conversations about the phenomena--because neither television, radio, or telephones existed at the time. There certainly are some very valid points made in this (and similar) documentaries on the subject, and this reviewer happens to believe that 'Ancient Astronauts' DID indeed visit our planet...and continue to do so. This doc is a bit older--it is NOT the 2009 program recently aired on The History Channel. That dvd IS now also available for those interested. Though not as terribly dated as 'Chariots Of The Gods' (which explored this subject matter well over 20 years ago), it does not have the 'slick look' and production values of the aforementioned (2009) doc of the same name. One reviewer (Mr. Mingo) mentions the lack of female and other 'ethnic' (I hope that term is not offensive to some) interviewees...but my question to him is--So WHAT? Does everyone nowadays have to be a 'Politically Correct' EXTREMIST??? Should we stop watching some of the films produced in the 50's, 60's, and 70's just because the majority of the cast were caucasion? I can totally appreciate the wide variety of nationalities when it comes to today's productions. It certainly adds to the realism. But to bring up a point such as this (no females or non-caucasions in the production) in a review is just downright SILLY and smacks of self-righteousness. The bottom line is this is an intelligent, well-done, thought provoking doc. Whether or not aliens visited (or continue to visit) our planet is for YOU to decide!",1249862400,17,1898,4.971698113207547
8224740,1,B000WP09PY,"Hello.

Listen. you probably saw a show called ""Ancient Aliens"" on The History Channel recently and thought it was cool, so you wanted to buy the DVD. Well, I was the same way. BUT, this isn't it! I bought this DVD and it's OLD. It just has the same name as the other one that was more recent. The one you want is also called ""Ancient Aliens"" but it hasn't come out yet. Check the History Channels website and do a search there. The cover you want has a silver UFO and a crop circle animal looking thing. I just want to save people from doing what I did.",1239235200,150,554,4.08256880733945
