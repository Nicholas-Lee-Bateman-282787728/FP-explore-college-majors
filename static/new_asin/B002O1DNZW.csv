8375809,3,B002O1DNZW,"One of these cases pertains to a man who got on a gay chat line and then had supposed ""gay panic"" when the gay man on the other line touched him.  Men who seduce gay men just to beat them up are called ""rough trade.""  It's a bit of an old term, but the tragedy occurs to this day.  This man was not ""on the down low.""  He purposely killed a man for close to nothing and now has to pay with life in prison.  This is different from the episode where the man flipped out when his sex partner turned out to be HIV-positive.  This was more conniving.  I hope this episode can teach men to not play the rough trade role at all; go get a legitimate job, darnit!",1465516800,,654,3.946564885496183
