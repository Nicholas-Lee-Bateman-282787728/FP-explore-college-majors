7564695,5,B0196M706E,"LIKE this series so much, I bought this season as a gift for my sis.

Tom Select as a primary cast member portraying the NYPD Commissioner, Frank Reagan, in the CBS drama, Blue Bloods casts a positive image of the NY police department  police personnel in general  but including episodes of corruption and skull doggrel, especially when his father, Henry Reagan portrayed by Len Cariou, rehashes his memories of the ""Good 'Ole Days' Around the family Sunday dinner, somewhat of a family tradition of the Reagan family and shades of Boston Legal's balcony scene.

An actor/actress is excellent when they elicit an emotional response from me and both Bridget Moynahan, Reagan's lawyer daughter, whom I dislike as an uppity by-the-books bore,  and Sami Gayle, who plays his granddaughter, a holier-than-thou teenager.

Will Estes, the youngest son shows potential and could eventually replace Selleck as commissioner. He has a ways to go, but the seven year program doesn't seem to be winding down in either good episodes or public approval so the audience will just have to be patient for Jamie Reagan to come into his own.

The ""bad"" boy brother, Danny Reagan, played by Donnie Wahlberg and married to Linda Reagan, played by Amy Carlson sit at Sunday's table with their two sons, Tony Terraciano as Jack Reagan and Andrew Terracing playing Sean Reagan. BB audience has watched these two brothers grow up on the show.

My least favorite character on the show is Maria Baetz played by Marisa Ramirez. She is Danny Reagan's partner. Not sure why, she just does not resinate with me. Perhaps her twangy NY accent? But that is perfect for her role.

As with most of Tom Selleck's projects, there is intrigue, mystery, family, good fun, thought provoking lines, but minus the blood & guts scenes the American audience is plummeted with by Hollywood. Good family viewing with older kids.

Good writing. Good scripts. Good casting and acting.

RECOMMEND the Blue Bloods series.",1505433600,3,1969,4.972560975609756

8744180,5,B0196M706E,"There is no better tv or movie drama for its multidimensional characters  and non- predictable storylines.  Charming breakthroughs in personalized jargon usage , fast break dialogue and surprising cinematic switches from one point of view to the opposite. Keeps the viewer alert to a diversity present in every viewpoint. I watch it to try and catch the undercurrents I missed the first time. Beautiful piece of work. Seamless texture of character/living settings/mesh of action and heart lines. This is award winning material that continues to entertain and inform over and over. distance",1535587200,,589,5.391304347826087
