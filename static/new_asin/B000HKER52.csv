2638554,5,B000HKER52,"If you love the campy fun, 80s fashions, big hair and outrageous stories of Dynasty, you'll love this 22 part series.

This show picks up seven years in story from the original mini-series.

The stunningly gorgeous Peta Toppano is RTE's evil Jilly, tossing out snide remarks while destroying lives, plotting to take over a family dynasty and seeking revenge on the also beautiful Stephanie Harper (Rebecca Gilling) - who is struggling to keep her family and business all together at any cost.

Backstabbing, murder attempts, greed, revenge, long lost children, love affairs, company takeovers, it is all here and great fun to watch.

This is a great example of the 80s primetime soap and I cannot believe it did not gain a following and ended after this first series.

Catch it if you can.",1239667200,,789,4.858208955223881

2638556,5,B000HKER52,"Return to eden was the australia answer to dynasty. Premiered as mini series and continued with this first and only season return to eden gives what it promises. Power, love, hate, corruption, money, beautiful actors, exactly what dynasty did.
 Unfortunately the show was canselled after the end of the first season which presented here in all it's glory.
 You are a dynasty fan ?
 Get this.",1182297600,5,391,4.893939393939394

8140131,5,B000HKER52,"I saw this on television and taped it on VHS and I have watched it so much that my VHS tapes are showing ware and tare.  I have been looking for a copy(ies)of this since that time, several years in fact.  It is great that this is now available and even in DVD no less.  Thanks to whomever is responsible.

Later:  I did like this but thought this was the 3-day mini series that this 'soap' was a continuation of.  I would still like the part that started it all.",1322870400,,462,4.0777777777777775
