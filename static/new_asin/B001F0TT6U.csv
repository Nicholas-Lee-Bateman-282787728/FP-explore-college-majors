8300288,5,B001F0TT6U,The fight between Tank and Oleg is absolutely CLASSIC. Probably the best fight for that time and it was a war!!!,1406678400,,112,4.380952380952381
8300289,4,B001F0TT6U,This is a very good collection for big UFC fans. There are some very big fights in this collection such as the 1st superfight between Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie. This is a must have set for UFC fans.,1341446400,,202,4.205128205128205
8300290,5,B001F0TT6U,"This was a Christmas gift and I believe by December 28th we had watched the entire box set. The rounds go quick, it's brutal and the match-ups seem unfair at times but that's what makes it good. Great collection to own, highly recommend to any UFC fan. It's really entertaining and we're looking to buy the next box set.",1294099200,,320,4.440677966101695
8300291,5,B001F0TT6U,"This is the real deal UFC.  This (and especially 1-4) was when there were no rules, no gloves, and no rounds.  The fighters back in the early UFCs were better than those now, they were trained to win fights, not to survive rounds.  Not to mention the rounds, rules, and gloves change the outcome of matches.  There were also no weight classes, so the competition was really about who the best fighters were.",1262476800,2,407,4.534246575342466
