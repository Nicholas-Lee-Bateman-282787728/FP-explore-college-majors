8755608,5,B01DDK5L02,"I have to give this one 5 stars!  All kids love Cat in the Hat; he's silly, inquisitive, and always up for an adventure!  But PARENTS are going to be delighted right along, as your whole family learns (let's be honest, Mom and Dad pick up some new things too!) all about different kinds of weather.

This DVD was a great value at 90 minutes; we chose to break it into thirds so we could do related crafts and activities I had found to accompany the new things we were learning!  It held my 3 year olds attention and my 6 year old able to pick up and retain a lot more than I expected!  We talked about the specifics as we crafted and did activities so I'm sure that helped reinforce the important info.

Their favorites were the song about all of the colors of the rainbow, learning how puddles go up to the sky and come down again later (water cycle), and learning all about strider bugs that can walk on water!  They were very interested in where we could get those special shoes that Nick and Sally had for ""walking"" across the water lol!

As a Mom, I just want my kids to love LEARNING and the relaxed, fun approach to this video was just another tool for me to use in our learning journey.  I also find it so amusing that I forget Martin Short is the voice of the Cat because well, he just embodies it!  I love the fish and Nick and Sally are sweet, curious, good natured characters. My kids continue to be delighted by Thing 1 and Thing 2.  A super endearing cast of characters and a real winner on this one as far as the content.",1467244800,2,1536,4.172881355932203

This 90 minute DVD is filled with seven adventures that are all about the weather which effects everyone, every day. I love that it has fun activities for children to do in between the episodes. It easily keeps you focused while teaching you about the weather in a fun and entertaining way.
Dr. Seuss is loved by all children around the world and this DVD is voiced in many different languages.  What started out as silly childrens book is something that children worldwide now share.

Sometime science can be boring, confusing and seem like a whole different language but now we have The Cat in the Hat making science and weather concepts easy to understand and remember. Learning can be fun and exciting when watching animations that make it easy to remember. I recently interviewed Julie Stall, the producer of this series and she understands what makes children laugh and smile and has done an amazing job bringing Dr. Seuss books to life in over 60 animated episodes.

Martin Short is the cats meow. He is the voice of The Cat in the Hat and has been in this role for over six years. His ability as a great character actor who can do many voices makes him a perfect fit for this role. I had the pleasure of meeting him in person a short time ago and found him very pleasant, easy to talk to and extremely funny.

Im so impressed by Alexa Torrington who voices Sally, the cute adorable little girl who goes off on learning adventures with the Cat. She has played the same character for over six years and is now a young adult, yet her voice sounds the same as when she started as a young girl. Sally is kind hearted, curious, and clever and loves learning. She is endearing and cute to watch.

Jacob Ewaniuk voices Nick, the little boy who follows the Cat. He has also kept his voice consistent to his character. Nick is inquisitive, humorous and compelling to watch.

I love to learn and this DVD taught me lots of lessons such as how clouds are formed, how wind power works, what the water cycle is and much more. One of the most intriguing lessons on this DVD is Chasing Rainbows because you get to learn two lessons in one. I love rainbows and this entire lesson is all about rainbows and has a catchy song that is still stuck in my head. I learned all about the colors of the rainbow and where they come from.

Of course there is also the Fish voiced by Rob Tinkler. I adore Fish. Fish asks great question that make you think. He should hide the answers and make finding them a little trickier, although they are perfect hiding places for younger children. Then we have the cutest thing ever - Thing One and Thing Two. They always seem to be helpful and ready for The Cat in the Hats whistle to lend a helping hand. All three of these characters add a little something to this series and they are all adorable, quirky, humorous sidekicks for The Cat in the Hat.

I recommend this series to ages 3 to 12. Younger kids will love the animation. Older kids will have science lessons reinforced and fun, cute cartoons to watch. I rate this 5 out of 5 Thinga-ma-jigger red and white top-hat stars.
