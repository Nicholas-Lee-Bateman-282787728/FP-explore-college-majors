7980748,2,B0000897CI,"This seemed like it would be a mix between ""Boyz N Da Hood"" and ""Traffic.""  Instead, it was kinda a romantic film.  This could have asked interesting questions about when Californians meet Floridians, or how Mexican-Americans and Cuban-Americans interconnect.  Instead, it was just full of capricious happenings.  The straight male main characters are puerile.  They do a lot of pot, farting, and masturbating humor.  The female characters can only have simplistic conversations.  This is an obvious sign of sexism in the script-writing process.  The women are constantly bikini-clad, doing nothing besides being eye candy.  There is a gender-deviant, masochistic gay male concierge in this film.  It's an obvious rip off of a character in ""Fear of a Black Hat"" and it's just as obnoxious and homophobic.  Finally, there are two models who do nothing for the plot.  They are meant to be elitist and yet they act and speak just as ""ghetto"" as any other character.  Like the other female parts, their roles are shallow and obviously a sign of sexiam.
This movie was so silly and pointless I almost don't have the energy to hate it.",1048118400,5,1129,4.973262032085562
