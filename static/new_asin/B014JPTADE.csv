8730997,5,B014JPTADE,"We loved this film -- such a delightful romantic comedy. I would love to buy this on DVD with English subtitles. There are English subtitles in a existence -- we saw the film this weekend at that  French Film Festival in Richmond, Va. Can't we please have a region 1 version with English subtitles?",1459728000,5,298,4.518518518518518
