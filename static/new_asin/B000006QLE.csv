1196390,5,B000006QLE,"This documentery is a wonderful telling of the story of Bilmore, George Washington Vanderbilt's wonderful French Chteau estate.
First telling a brief summery of the family's wealth, this video leaves no detail untold. Did you know Biltmore is five times the size of Central Park? or Vanderbilt was single when Bilmore was constructed? That and many other amazing facts are included in this video. Many of the 255 rooms within Biltmore, are explored in breathtakingly sweeping images, including Mr. Vanderbilt's bedroom, Mr. Vadebilt's bedroom, the Great Hall, the Winter Garden, and many other beautiful rooms.
This video shows, with exquisite detail, the construction of not only Biltmore House, and the entire estate, but also Biltmore Village, the homes that were built for the estate's workers, which is today one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in our nation!
Extesive histories of both Richard Morris Hunt, the estate's architect and Fredrick Law Olmsted, the estate's landscape designer are included.
It is quite obvoius absolutly no expense was spared with Biltmore. Also, much of Vanderbilt's collection, still in Biltmore, is featured in this video.
Included, in all their glory, are Biltmore's many gardens, still maintained by the talented staff. Particually lovely is the Walled Garden, to the north of the house, with it's enormous (nothing in Bilmore is normal size!) Conservatory, housing plants from all over the world!
Be warned, once you view this video, you will want to visit Biltmore Estate. But to visit Biltmore, to suspend onself in this world of weath, privilage, and bygone slendor, is a wonderfully magical experiance that should not be missed!
You will want to visit Biltmore if you buy this video, and if you visit Biltmore, you will want this video to relive the experiance!
It's a simply wonderful video, and an amazing home, America's Largest Home, Biltmore Estate!",1003190400,9,1902,5.259868421052632
1196391,4,B000006QLE,"The video provides a historical perspective of George Vanderbilt's lifestyle during the guilded age beginning with the creation of the family's wealth by his grandfather.  The creation of Biltmore Estate is explored through references to the homes of his parents, his travels throughout Europe and the Vanderbilt relationships to Richard Morris Hunt and Frederick Law Olmsted.
The documentary provides a glimpse into the the treasures contained within the home.  The main rooms within Biltmore, which cannot be photographed without the permission of the estate, are presented in the video.  The gardens and surrounding moutains are also presented in the documentary.
The presentation does not feature all of the rooms that are available with a general admission to the estate and is limited in providing behind the scenes photography of additional rooms that may also be seen with special tour packages.  The video presentation does not expose rooms that are currently not available to public viewing or the restoration processes that are constantly being provided.
The video presentation has limited footage of the gardens and greenhouse.  The many gardens within the estate are well worth visiting while the greenhouse is a masterpiece within itself.
The video presentation is a glimpse into an estate that holds too many treasures to be viewed within the limited time period of approximately 50 minutes.  The video presentation does provide a historical prespective for Biltmore Estate and features the major rooms of interest that are contained within the estate.",1001462400,8,1567,5.42798353909465

1196395,4,B000006QLE,"I went to Biltmore a month or so ago, and was fascinated by the place. I looked everywhere I could online forba copy of this, but no websites have it for streaming. Gives you some cool history of the family and such, but not as much of the house as I'd hoped. It's cool, but I was expecting more content with some sort of virtual tour.",1420848000,,335,4.090909090909091
1196396,5,B000006QLE,a  great  view  of  a  great  house....thanks,1416873600,,45,4.714285714285714
1196397,5,B000006QLE,Great!  Biltmore was an interesting man.,1409184000,,40,5.666666666666667
1196398,4,B000006QLE,It does a very good job of highlighting an absolutely beautiful stunning estate. Watch the movie and you will definitely want to visit Biltmore...,1406678400,,146,5.125
1196399,5,B000006QLE,"I miss this series.  The stories were fascinating, the visuals were stunning and most of them introduced viewers to places they could actually visit.  I went to Asheville to see Biltmore but found the city to be just as worthy.  The program actually shows most of the views you would see on a tour, providing an excellent reminder to those who can't return often.  Just seeing it is breathtaking.  Knowing all the intrigue behind the building of this welcoming estate makes it even better.  I'll watch it over and over.",1399939200,2,519,4.711111111111111

1196401,5,B000006QLE,"This was a great preparation to our trip to the Biltmore Estate. If you visit, be sure to take several of the extra tours. The Estate is definitely more than a one day experience.",1389916800,,179,4.294117647058823
1196402,5,B000006QLE,I visited and toured the Biltmore Estate and wanted to find something that would continue to bring it back for me.  This video is very well done.  It highlighted a number of things that I did not pick up on in the self guided tour.  Highly recommended for anyone who has visited or wants to visit Biltmore.,1374105600,,306,4.333333333333333
1196403,3,B000006QLE,I have been to the Biltmore Mansion and have read a few books that are recently published so I was a little disappointed that this was a documentary from 1995. A lot of the pictures were ones I have already seen but in general for someone who has never been it will be a good introduction into the beauty of the house and its surroundings.,1364256000,,339,4.230769230769231
1196404,4,B000006QLE,"A really good program although the product description is misleading. It says you get to see rooms not open to the public and there was only one room they showed that I haven't seen on the general tours. So if you're hoping for a true behind the scenes tour of all those tantalizing off limit rooms like I was, you're in for a huge disappointment. That said, it is an excellent documentary that gives a bevy of general information on the history of Biltmore, its construction, and its gardens, and a glimpse of some of the main rooms you'd see on a house tour. Absolutely worth watching, although I probably wouldn't have bought it had I known it didn't have what I looking for. However, now that the money is spent, I'm not sorry I own it.",1363046400,3,740,4.408759124087592
1196405,3,B000006QLE,i had just gone to the biltmore and wanted more info. This was ok but it didn't really cover enough. rent or borrow from a friend,1362182400,,129,4.0
1196406,5,B000006QLE,"An excellent photoplay of one of the great American landmarks. The only thing better than seeing this video is actually being on the premises of the estate in person, which I was 6 years ago. The Biltmore Estate makes the Hearst Castle look like a cottage. Eat your heart out, William Randolph.",1354838400,3,294,4.673076923076923
1196407,4,B000006QLE,This video was good enough.  The story and all were fantastic.  Great information.  I wish it went a little more into detail about the construction of the house and the conversion of the dairy farm into what is now the winery but it was pretty informative regardless.  The only major drawback that keeps it from being a 5 is that I couldn't get it to play on my DVD player.  It kept locking up at the start.  I actually had to play it on my PS2 and it worked fine.,1231977600,4,464,4.1
1196408,5,B000006QLE,"I know of no other property that has had so much influence in setting a standard in the United States as Biltmore. After George Washington Vanderbild build it, raise the bar to all others, so after Biltmore, dozens of fine hotels had taken the name. The castle itself -because it is a castle as impressing as, let's say, Azay le Rideau, Chenonnceaux or other beauties of Loira valley, is incredibly beautiful, surrounded by hundreds of thousands acres of the most beatiful woods, all made to match the castle, by Richard Morris Hunt (who designed the castle), and Frederick Law Olmstead (who designed the landscape). Biltmore is one man's dream made real.",1202947200,6,655,4.90990990990991
1196409,5,B000006QLE,"I visited Biltmore several years ago.  It brings back great memories.  It took 5 years and an army of men to build.
This DVD gives lots of information about the house itself, the man who built it, and the era in which it was built.
In addition, it shows some of the rooms,
the gardens (which are extensive), and art collections.  The dining hall is 70 feet high; heated by a six-foot+ tall, 3-hearth fireplace (at least 18 foot wide).
It had all the modern conveniences for the time, such as refrigeration, electricity, centralized communications, (etc). I would love to visit at Christmas time; I understand the decorations are stunning over the holidays.",1185753600,17,656,4.787610619469026
1196410,5,B000006QLE,I've been fascinated by the Biltmore Estate ever since I first saw it in movies as a kid.  I've visited there twice and was blown away both times.  No other home in the nation can match Biltmore for its scope and detail.  This video elegantly captures the Estate from the mansion to the grounds and everywhere in between.  It's beautifully shot and also shares the full history of this greatest of America's Castles.,1179100800,26,416,4.657534246575342
1196411,4,B000006QLE,"I enjoyed the film. The narrators are good. You get to meet the guy who currently owns the castle...the grandson of the builder. If you plan on actually visiing the castle, this would be a good way to preview it before you go. A&E did a good job of producing and editing this piece. I doubt that it covers ALL the rooms on the tour, but it seems to at least hit the highlights.",1152057600,14,377,4.108108108108108

It's incredible in this day and age that A & E can't see their way clear to add subtitles to DVD's.  This is our last purchase.  And even though it does say ""no subtitle""s somewhere on the packaging - it was not clear when we bought this product on line.
