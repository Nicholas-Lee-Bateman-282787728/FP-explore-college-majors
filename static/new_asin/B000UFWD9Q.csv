Due to hard times the families cross paths resulting tin the son of the Greek family Tony Petrakis (Robert Wagner) and the WASP daughter Gwyneth Rhys (Terry Moore) falling in love their parents' chagrin. To really stir thing up Arnold Dix (Peter Graves) who also has eyes for Gwyneth is unscrupulous and does nefarious acts agent the Greeks.

I know you have herd the story before and probably saw Romeo and Juliet or ""Westside Story"". However, the story and actors make it worth revisiting.

The film has been remastered and looks great on large screen height definition televisions. The music of Bernard Hermann works as a subtle character its self adds to the mood and not overwhelming the story or dialog.

Gilbert Roland is the proud Greek patriarch that makes a sort of John Wayne entrance at the beginning of the movie. Richard Boone, a very diverse actor plays the girls father.

This is the first underwater adventure shot in CinemaScope.

8213173,5,B000UFWD9Q,"The simple yet brilliantly visual BENEATH THE 12-MILE REEF filmed in Cinemascope has now become a classic for its beautiful cinematography accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's equally beautiful score often times psychological as it explores the dichotomy of nature's beauty and the lurking dangers that are often present. A very young Robert Wagner and Terry Moore provide the love interest, each coming from two rival families, in this tale of the sponge business in Tarpon Springs, Florida. Gilbert Roland as Wagner's father brings a vibrant and worldly sense of realism to this film full of bravado and restraint wisdom that permeates the simple yet effective storyline. This is a very entertaining film and works on several levels.",1337904000,7,732,5.318965517241379
