381505,3,6301928156,"Plot, drama, suspense, character development -- this western has them all, to reasonable measure.  It seems awfully like other HBO movies I have seen.  If you like westerns, this may be a candidate for an evening's entertainment.  If you like exceptional westerns, try ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", ""A Big Hand for the Little Lady"", ""El Mariachi"", ""Stagecoach"" or the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns.",1062806400,19,408,5.246153846153846
381506,5,6301928156,"Noble Adams (Kris Kristofferson) is a retired tracker.  He runs a ranch and has a wife.  He wants nothing to do with his former life.  An old friend is calling in a favor and Noble must return to the hunt one last time.  Noble's son Tom (Mark Moses) has just graduated from college and has come to tell Noble that he will be living in the east and practicing law.  When he finds his dad is going on a track, he headstrongly joins the chase.  They will be tracking Red Jack Stilwell (Scott Wilson), a self professed Morman Avenging Angel that just broke out of prison and has been on a violent rampage.  He is travelling with a kidnapped women and child.
Noble doesn't really want his son along.  He doesn't think the boy can handle the brutality of the land and is worried about the brutality that his son may see in him.  Noble Adams is not just any tracker, he's the best tracker ever.  The law's avenger, the army refers to him as Nemisis (The God of Vengeance).  Even the indians fear him.  So Noble, the aging sheriff and Tom Adams, the eastern college boy set out to hunt down the ruthless Red Jack Stillwell and his gang.
Far from a typical father son bonding movie, Tom sees Noble as a cruel, harsh and exceptionally unforgiving man.  But he comes to understand that the land has made him that way.  Tom turns out to be just as hard but not quite as cold blooded as his father.  Hard men in a hard land, doing a hard job.
This unhearalded HBO production stands up as one of the great westerns of all time.  More people need to see this movie.  It is a classic with no shortage of action or suspense.  Although filmed a number of years ago, HBO would do well to provide us with a sequel of equal caliber.
Watch it and enjoy.",1030233600,209,1731,4.257668711656442

381871,4,6301928156,"This is another one of those good ""little films"" that has somehow slipped under the radar. Though made in 1988, HBO waited until 2001 to issue it on DVD.

The simple and unfussy script by Kevin Jarre (""Tombstone"") is complemented by John Guillermin's simple and unfussy direction. * The dramatic center of the story is not so much Adams' and Crawford's search for a group of killers, as it is the internal conflict of Adams' son Tom, an Eastern-educated lawyer. Tom has been so thoroughly ""civilized"" that he can only shoot in immediate self-defense. He cannot kill in revenge. ** When he repeatedly fails to kill people he ""should"" kill, the story's tragic ending is inevitable.

Highly recommended, an unknown film to share with friends.

* It's a surprise his direction is as good as it is, as Guillermin has been associated with some big-budget stinkers.

** There's heavy irony here, as the men being tracked are Danites who have no such compunction. Their leader is ""Red Jack"" Stillman, Red Jack being one of the names for Jack the Ripper.",1364256000,,1045,4.788888888888889

Special effects, etc. just don't work with that genre, but hollywood just isn't interested in making anything they don't need computer graphics, blow 'em up, big action scenes, etc.  Somebody out there realized it when they made this movie.  Us baby boomers are a large market and were brought up on westerns shown on tv and the big screen.  Kris Kristofferson is great, as usual, but so was the rest of the cast.  The storyline was great.

Story of a Tracker that comes out of retirement as a favor to an old friend to track down a band of ruthless killers. Kristofferson's character's is, ""The Tracker"". His son, a visiting newly graduated attorney visiting from back east joins the manhunt but has allot to learn about his father and the men their chasing.
Fair story, less than good acting. Attention to detail by director and film editor was terrible. ( HBO's budget must have been minuscule for this one.) Several scenes have Contrails in them; Also, tire tracks during horse chase scenes are readily visible in several scenes.
The acting by the BAD GUYS and the BOUNTY HUNTERS help carry an otherwise 2 star movie.
The ending is more in the tradition of ""Old School"" westerns which is a GOOD thing !

382011,5,6301928156,"I'm a fan of good westerns.  This is a good one.  Kris Kristofferson plays a retired Tracker (Noble Adams) who is coaxed out of retirement by his friend Marshall Crawford (played by David Huddleston) to track Jack Stillwell and his 'gang' of 4 who broke out of Yuma prison and went on a killing spree.  The movie explores not only how bad some men in the west can be, but show's how they sometimes got that way.  Noble's son Tom (Mark Moses) has just returned home from his Eastern college.  Tom's Mother (Noble's first wife) died when Tom as a child, and now Noble has remarried and is living and ranching in an isolated area of New Mexico.  The Tracker does a great job building characters from conversations and actions as the movie progresses and that's really one of the things I liked most about this movie.  By the time the movie is over, you feel like you really know Noble, his son Tom, and Jack Stillwell because they reveal who and what they are by actions and conversation, not by flashbacks or narrations.  This may well be one of the best Kris Kristofferson movies he ever made.  The script is tight, the action and acting very well done and the story is more than good guys fighting bad guys.  Noble Adams character is both hard and gentle, brash and caring, bold and humble and Kristofferson pulls it off beautifully.  Supporting cast for the most part do and excellent job.

382092,5,6301928156,"One of the greatest westerns I have watched.  Of course I think Kris Kristofferson rates one of the greatest. I don't like sad ending movies but I am so glad I didn't miss this one.  Noble Adams (Kris) was one of the best trackers of his time. He showed no mercy to the killers he tracted and he knew if he wasn't hard they would surley kill him.  But on his gentle loving side he send his son Tom Adams (Mark Moses) to get an education so people would look up to him and he could walk proud. Noble  now felt no one would ever feel Tom was unfortunate. Mark did a great job of acting and sure gave the movie some suprises of what a college student could learn along with book learning.  I recommend this DVD highly
I will watch it again and again.

382093,3,6301928156,"I remember this movie from my days watching cable TV movies.  I love westerns, not enough made nowadays.  Good story, solid movie, but limited appeal.",1192579200,,150,4.96
382094,2,6301928156,"A pretty lame western from all aspects. Weak story line, poor character development and the acting (if one can call it that)was almost non-existant. The movie was filmed in beautiful locations however, the director was not even interested enough in the project to shoot in locations void of jet trails in the sky.

If you like westerns like I do, I would not watch this one more than once. I was very relieved when it ended, so relieved I skipped the credits at the end.",1137110400,7,470,4.529411764705882
382095,4,6301928156,"Westerns seem uniquely well suited for the presentation of (near) epic morality tales.  Even when made for television they lend themselves to the Big Issues.  Beautifully filmed in New Mexico, THE TRACKER is a 1988 HBO production that touches on the stuff with deep roots - need and obligation, trust and home.  Mostly, though, it about vengeance and the fine line between the Good and the Bad.

 The Bad is ably portrayed by Scott Wilson, who's probably best remembered as Robert Blake's killing-spree partner in In Cold Blood.  Wilson plays fervent Danite and general sicko Jack `Red Jack' Stillwell. The legendary Danites, as the movie explains, were a perverted branch of Mormons who cleansed the Earth by indiscriminate murder. When Red Jack and gang invade New Mexico Federal Marshal Lane Crawford (David Huddleston) is called on to track them down, dead or alive.  But Crawford isn't as young as he used to be, and he needs help.  He calls on old friend and renowned tracker Noble Adams (Kris Kristofferson - `even the Apaches were afraid of Adams.')  Although inwardly reluctant, Adams agrees to track down the bad guys.  Even more reluctant is he to allow his half-son Tom (Mark Moses) to tag along, but the young man is set on it.  And so it is three hunting six - four bad guys and two female hostages.

  Although Kristofferson sometimes comes across a little detached he doesn't do anything here to embarrass Kevin Jarre's smart script or John Guillermin's taut direction.  Noble Adams is more complex than Kristofferson plays him.  He's a reluctant avenger, a brutal killer when the situation demands it, a man who sends his son off to college and learns that his return home may not be permanent.  It's the type of character western fans like to cheer for, one that's best developed by an actor who can play all the angles.  We cheer for Adams, alright, but we're a lot more interested when Wilson's Red Jack is on the screen.  All that doesn't make THE TRACKER any less a very good western, nor one that I wouldn't hesitate to heartily endorse.",1130025600,48,2060,4.768361581920904

7817247,3,6301928156,g  Kris Kristofferson is very good in this. I think as a matter of fact.  This is the best movie I have seen with him.  Although I always think of him first as a songwriter.  Before even being a singer or a actor.  He plays a tracker going after a gang who escaped from prison.  And went on a killing spree and took a young girl hostage.  I wasn't expecting what happened in the end.  And Scott Wilson is also very good as the crazy leader of the gang.  And it's been a long time since I watched this.  I need to watch it again.,1523923200,,528,3.942857142857143

Kris Kristofferson is at his best in this film and wonderful interaction between his character and the guy who plays his son.  You can definitely tell how comfortable Kris Kristofferson is in the saddle in this movie the way he rides that horse in a chase scene.  Very good story and at times on the edge of your seat suspense.  I was very surprised by the sad ending though.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a very good entertaining western.",1470182400,,590,4.27027027027027
