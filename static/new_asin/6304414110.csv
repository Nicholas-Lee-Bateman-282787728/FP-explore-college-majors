883829,5,6304414110,"Do you ever pick up one of those movies at the video store and say, ""Wow, this is going to be so terrible that I just have to see it!""  Well, I do, and that's exactly what I said about  ""Curdled"".  I was so wrong - this film is fantastic! Originally a short film, Curdled struck Tarentino like lightning and he promptly urged (forced) Braddock to make it into a feature length movie.  I would not ordinarily apply such a clich phrase as ""wickedly funny"" to anything, but that is exactly what this film noir is.  Gabrielle (magnificently performed by Angela Jones) is teetering on the brink of an obsession with serial killers.  Her consuming desire to understand the mind of a murderer motivates her to land a job with a post-murder cleaning service.  Her new occupation allows her the opportunity to get closer to the crimes than she had anticipated.  This film is out of this world, if you don't mind the sight of blood and laughing at crazy people, that is.  I giggle sadistically to myself even now at the thought of it.  Oh yeah, William Baldwin is in it.",1010102400,11,1060,4.473958333333333
883830,4,6304414110,"If you enjoy quirky dark humor, disdain media's macabre  obsession with murder and mayhem but find it all rather fascinating despite yourself, and don't get queezy at the sight of blood - lots of it,  then this movie delivers.  William Baldwin, a bit creepy anyway, is a particularly creepy serial killer.  Angela Jones' innocent, wide-eyed ghoulish lust and studiousness over accounts of gruesome murders is hypnotizing.  And when the movie has ended and is rewinding itself, Angela's character should have assuaged any guilt you may harbor over your own small weakness for watching films like this or reading about grisly goings-ons.",980035200,6,635,5.247524752475248

883832,4,6304414110,"I have recommended this Quirky Little Thriller to Many-a-friend and they told me they turned it off after the first half an hour because ""It Was Too Boring."" But I'm telling Everybody, Stick With It, the last 40 Minutes are truly Inspired Cinema. The Film on a whole is Startlingly Original, daringingly dark and.. Great Entertainment. It gets four stars instead of five as the start IS a little slow-going, (which is probably why it fell into Obscurity) But it's still an All-round Great Film.
PS: Quinten Tarantino Executive Produced this film, and there is a reference to Seth And Richard Gecko from ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". Kelly Preston makes a Cameo in Both Films.",977011200,5,668,4.817391304347826
883833,5,6304414110,"""Curdled"" stars Angela Jones (as Gabriela, who keeps a scrapbook of newspaper stories about grisly murder) and William Baldwin (as Paul Guell, the Blue Blood killer, who beheads Miami socialites). Quentin Tarantino produced the movie, and it's got a ""Pulp Fiction"" feel to it, but it's also got Gabriela &#8211 A woman who turns heads and makes her gruesome obsession seem like a sweet pastime. We're glad for Gabriela when she finds her perfect job. Hired by a forensic cleaning service, she mops up after violent crime. One evening, Gabriela returns to the scene of an especially bloody murder and retraces the events of the crime, when suddenly she stumbles into the Blue Blood killer himself. Naturally, the two of them tango.",965692800,2,730,4.991803278688525
883834,5,6304414110,This movie makes all other dark comedy's small in comparision.  Acting and a rare script came together for a spectacular movie.  There is no doubt that sometimes they do make original movies... Like this one!,922147200,,208,4.914285714285715
883955,5,6304414110,"This movie has an exciting plot with a serial killer on the loose.  It has all the things you want in a Tarantino film including a well written plot, twisted comedy and lots of blood.  The ending is sensational.  Don't overlook this film like I almost did.  This film will become one of your favorites to sit beside Pulp Fiction and Four Rooms.",1359849600,2,344,4.412698412698413
883956,4,6304414110,"Loved the movie, very unique story line.  Not a usual type of murder movie. It gave me a job line I wish I would have known about when I was young.  Passed it on to many of my friends,the music gives it a flare of fun.",1326326400,,218,3.717391304347826
883957,5,6304414110,Wore out the VHS years ago. Really creepy funny. A great movie to pop in the DVD when people are over and bored to tears cause they have seen everything thats out there.,1291161600,,169,4.151515151515151
883958,5,6304414110,IMHO this is one of the most under-appreciated movies of all time.  Seemingly noone has heard of it.  The plot is similar to Dexter in that the young lady is fascinated with killers and death. So she goes to work for a crime scene cleanup company where everyone thinks she's a freak.  But she is so childlike and innocent in her curiosity that the movie takes on a HYSTERICAL morbidity!  This is truly a funny movie with a well-chosen cast.  Definitely worth the purchase.  And if you don't like it- you can always give it away!  :),1289779200,,532,4.422680412371134
883959,5,6304414110,"I had seen the movies several years ago and was told it was no longer in print - I loved it, simple, yet keeps your interest. Just wish I could find the CD Slash did for the background music.",1254009600,,191,3.923076923076923
883960,5,6304414110,Loved this movie because it is so bizarre with a charming Latin flair.  You must have a slightly morbid sense of humor to enjoy!!!,1131062400,2,130,4.416666666666667
883961,5,6304414110,"Angela Jones is terrific as the big-eyed, gum popping Gabriela who's been obsessed with bizarre deaths since she was a skinny little gum-popping girl.  Now an adult, she still collects articles about grisly deaths and decides to work for a ""cleaning company"" in order to get an insight and thrill cleaning up after murders and messy deaths.  She's terrific with her slightly prim flowered dresses and fascinated nodding as she listens to gory details.  Billy Baldwin is funny and charming as the boyishly handsome serial killer who first woos, then stabs his rich victims.  Daisy Fuentes and Mel Gorham, a terrific and underused actress (Smoke and Blue in the Face--Oggy's girlfriend), have bits as Gabriela's coworkers.

This is a dark, dark comedy.  Not because it's ironic or mean spirited in the way that Friends and Neighbors is or In the Company of Men, but because of the plot and subject matter; you find yourself liking the killer and laughing about people dying and Gabriela's slightly fetishized fascination.  I think the film's a gem, but, there you go.  There was one point in the film where, though amused, I was slightly queasy.  If you are squeamish and don't think there could ever be anything remotely funny about serial killers, then I'd skip this one.  If you collect Dia de los Muertos figurines and think the macabre is interesting and entertaining, then you might agree with Gabriela--death can be funny, creepy, absurd and interesting. This is one of the films on my ""enjoys dark comedies"" meter, along with The Last Seduction and Goodbye Lover.

If you do get it, don't forget to watch through the credits--funny bit at the end that I missed the first time. And if you aren't a huge Tarantino fan, don't be put off by his introduction to the film, credit where credit is do--the guy was instrumental in getting the film made and you can always fastforward.",1121731200,13,1881,4.846875
883962,5,6304414110,"Ive been waiting for this to hit dvd for awhile,Ever since I watched the vhs I was hooked. This thing aint for everyone thats for sure. You gotta have a dark sense of humor or just hang it up and watch something else. The dvd is fully loaded. It has:the short film it was based on,deleted scenes,commentary,plus a gallery,tv ads,a kelly preston tv show,plus alot more.its a shame there aren't more people who know about this great flick.",1083369600,3,437,4.615384615384615
883963,5,6304414110,"This is the same fun, quirky black comedy that all the other reviews mention. Thankfully, the DVD is letterboxed, and has truly extensive special features; among them:
* Commentary by the director and producer (co-writers Reb Braddock and John Maass),
* a making-of featurette complete with brief interviews with cast and crew,
* the 30 minute short film that caught Quentin Tarantino's attention at a film festival in Italy,
* the even shorter 'Baby Curdled' - a film school directing project by John Maass,
* an extensive photo gallery mostly consisisting of candid shots of the cast and crew,
* deleted scenes and an alternate ending,
* the original theatrical trailer,
* by far the coolest interactive menu - watch for the fly!
* the commercials and made-for-tv movie that are seen in the film,
* the 'dance of death' rehearsal - you have got to see this!
* probably more than I'm not recalling
Most features have an introduction/explanation by director Reb Braddock.",1078704000,20,971,4.926829268292683
883964,2,6304414110,"This is a Tarantino movie. He didn't write or direct it, but executive-produced it. Surely must have been a blooper, because although it wallows in blood (don't all of his endeavours, predictably?) and scrambles to put a ""just kidding"" face on its darker impluses (don't all of his endeavours, again?), it never quite manages to emerge as a coherent or compelling film.
Angela Jones (the taxi driver in Pulp Fiction if you recall) is a Columbian in California smitten with murders. She takes up a job as a cleaning maid, not your ordinary maid but with a niche-business company that cleans up messes on crime scenes. On one of those scenes, she meets up with a real psychopath killer -- played with as straight a face as possible by Billy Baldwin -- who likes to hack women for dessert.
Intriguing pretext. Unfortunately, the actual movie while neat in bits and parts, is overall quite a boring fare. Jones, the ever so murky maid, has a grating type of naivette about her which is funny probably to people who like to see their women cutesy and hyper-melodramatic, but is annoying to me.
Not sure why this dud was produced. But sounds like with the likes of Kill Bill Quentin may well be developing a real taste for such gore which, if unsuccessful, can be shrugged off under the garb of ""oh, it was a black comedy"" or a spoof or some such weak-kneed toss-off.

7871905,5,6304414110,"This movie is often laughed at or harshly critiqued but I think of it not as a horror film, but as a dark comedy. Some if it is ridiculous, but putting yourself in this naive sick woman's head is fun for me.",1446076800,,207,3.9523809523809526
7871906,5,6304414110,I saw this movie along time ago and liked it's different story lline.  I love the music soundtrack too.  She played the taxi driver in pulp fiction and the character is the same too.,1428364800,,182,4.323529411764706
7871907,5,6304414110,"This truly is ""something different,"" to use Monty Python's segue. It's witty, bizarre, enthralling - and features a real individualist as its lead character. You won't have met anyone like Gabriela before. As one co-worker says of her, she is sort of oddly child-like. But while she has maintained a child's capacity to become utterly fascinated by some seemingly incidental question, the particular subject of her fascination reflects anything but what we regard as childish innocence.

Her fascination results in an unusual scene of dueling obsessions that will keep you guessing. Can this unlikely young woman hold her own against the most ruthless of homicidal maniacs? Who will win, and what will be the prize for winning - besides life itself?

The answer might not be strictly anatomically correct, but it's gory good fun.

What's more, this movie made me aware of a lucrative job opportunity. I've recommended ""Curdled"" to out-of-work acquaintances seeking extremely high-paying jobs that don't require much specific training. Although a few later movies, such as ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" featured  crime scene clean-up as a career path - this is the original and best training film on the subject. So if you aren't a gore-hound, but can stand the gore, this is the film to get you started.",1421280000,,1294,5.147619047619048

7871911,5,6304414110,"If you like DEXTER, this film is for you. Completed in the mid 90's, it may have even been a partial inspiration for the ShowTime series. William Baldwin is the perfect mix of sexy and evil, and Angela Jones is adorably weird and scary. The music, including Slash playing Spanish guitar, is lively and enhances the experience of the film. Watch it more than once.....it gets better with each viewing! I'm sorry I waited so long to purchase this very entertaining film! I also purchased the CD for the instrumental version of Obsession Confession, performed by the very talented Slash.",1376265600,,584,4.85
