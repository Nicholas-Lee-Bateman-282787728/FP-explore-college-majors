The oratorio is sung in German, but there are subtitles, to give you some idea of the action on the stage.  But to give you a better idea of the story, Id advise looking up Christmas Oratorio in Wikipedia.
 The ballet is strictly modern dance.  It starts out slowly for the first 5 minutes with no music as everyman emerges from the crowd with his small Christmas tree.  But then it livens up, with many interesting steps.  The dancing is excellent, and I found it very enjoyable.  For those religiously inclined and with a taste for dance, watching it during the Christmas season might be quite significant; and a respite from the endless series of Nutcrackers.
 But it is long, 1:23 + 1:14 hours on two discs.  It couldn't hold my attention for the full performance; and perhaps you might want to watch it in two halves, or even four quarters.  This performance was played to a live audience;  I imagine that there must have been an intermission half way through.  (Bachs Christmas Oratorio was first performed in 1763-64, and was sung and played over the 6 feast days of Christmas (12/25, 12/26, 12/27, 1/1, 1/2, and 1/6) with about 25 minutes per section.)",1470873600,4,1308,4.709251101321586

That was my first exposure to seeing Bach music opened up in this way, and Im pleased to see it again in John Neumeier and the Hamburg Ballets Christmas Oratorio. Bachs music is strong and can successfully flourish in some amazing places.

The choreographer Kim Brandstrup said in a recent Gramophone feature that big symphonic works like Beethoven symphonies are difficult to choreograph: the sound world can be so big that it dwarfs the human scale. That doesnt seem to be an impediment with Bach, as is clear in this splendid project. We perform to Bachs music, for a few hours unifying individuals of many different cultural and religious backgrounds. Neumeier says. For me the basic human values expressed through the choreography are always the most important thing.  I have very little knowledge of dance, but the movements devised by Neumeier to interpret and explain the universal humanity of Bachs music seemed both natural and powerful. Afraid at first that the joy and exultation of the opening Jauchzet frohlocket might turn into a kitschy Solid Gold Dancers do Bach! thing, I was pleased to see the universal/human element coming foreword at once. Luckily, the excellence of the dancers is matched by the musicians: the Choir of the Hamburgischen Staatsoper and the Philharmonisches Staatsorchester Hamburg, under Alessandro de Marchi. Watching this over the holidays this year was a moving experience; I look forward to seeing it again many Christmases in the future.",1452211200,5,1758,5.186619718309859
