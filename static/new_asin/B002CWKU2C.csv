3907218,4,B002CWKU2C,"Great double-feature.  Great price, great fun.  Perfect movies for a rainy day, with nothing to do.  Jim Brown kicking major butt, and bedding beautiful babes.  Both movies have basically the same plot:  People close to Slaughter(Brown), get killed by the syndicate, and ex green-beret Jim Brown must take it to the mob with guns, knives, fists, etc.  Check out Jonny Carson's old side-kick, Ed McMahon in Slaughter's big rip-off, as a whiny mob boss.  Throw these DVD's in, check your brain at the door, and enjoy!!",1384819200,3,516,4.930232558139535
3907219,5,B002CWKU2C,"Yes, another film from the 70s series that has great theme for its time. Great for the avid collector of this genre.",1370044800,,116,4.318181818181818
3907220,5,B002CWKU2C,"Jim Brown in ""Slaughter"" is Great! Great fast paced non-stop action flick! A truly forgotten gem! I am more amazed how the follow up though ""Slaughters Big rip off"" is pretty bad! I mean it's watchable but the first one is excellent with a strong cast. The sequel had Ed McMahon and seemed more comical and slow paced. For the price, you cannot go wrong with this double DVD set!",1366588800,2,379,4.428571428571429
3907221,5,B002CWKU2C,This is an excellent DVD set of these two Blaxploitation classics. You can never go wrong with Jim Brown! These two movies are among my favorite Drive-In/Grindhouse collections!,1365638400,,177,5.357142857142857
3907222,5,B002CWKU2C,"Where have all the good times gone?  They are right here in this awesome Jim Brown double feature.  The head shot alone in Slaughter's Big Ripoff and several other gore scenes alone are well worth the price.  Both movies are fast paced and full of Saturday Afternoon Double Feature exploits and action.  Return to a simpler time when movies had but one purpose, to entertain.",1364083200,2,375,4.723076923076923
3907223,5,B002CWKU2C,as a child and living in a strict home where going to the movies was tabo i am thankful to amazon.com for finding such great individuals who buy and sell such products. now i am just about to complete my blackexploitation movies library. these two movies were great,1276387200,3,265,4.541666666666667
3907224,4,B002CWKU2C,"I happened to catch Slaughter's Big Ripoff on cable late one night and I was pleasently surprised.  I've always been a fan of the genre, although none will ever top Pam Grier's Coffy, and I was happy with this purchase.  Jim Brown will always be the face of the Cleveland Browns, but once upon a time he dabbled in some acting (see The Dirty Dozen).  He tears through the bad guys and ladies with equal measure, and Stella Stevens is excellent as the woman always there with a smile and warm bed.  These are two pretty good movies and they come on two discs, it's not two movies compressed onto one DVD.  Enjoy.",1273276800,10,611,4.371681415929204

3907229,4,B002CWKU2C,"""Slaughter"" and ""Slaughter's Big Rip-Off"" were two action films starring former Cleveland Browns football legend Jim Brown.  Released during the so-called ""blaxploitation"" trend of the early 1970s, the films were designed to showcase Brown as a leading man, competitive with other action stars of the era like Clint Eastwood or Lee Marvin.  Budget-wise, these films were modestly produced, most prolifically by the now-defunct American International Films (Orion Pictures, and later MGM/UA eventually acquired the catalog rights- the films languished for years outside of syndication and in obscurity with bad VHS prints by low-rent distributors and foreign imports).

MGM cleans up the original films quite a bit, and they can be viewed in widescreen.  Bonus materials are limited, but viewers can see the original trailers.

The plots are standard for the time-period:  The mono-monikered Slaughter (his first name is never revealed) is a retired soldier, a Green Beret most recently having served in Vietnam.  In the first film, Slaughter's parents-- his father was hinted to be a non-gangster employee of a Mob numbers operation, is killed in a car bomb.  Slaughter then vows vengeance, aggressively tracking down the Mob boss who ordered the hit.  Along the way, Slaughter runs afoul of U.S. Treasury Agents who conscript him to be a consultant in tracking down the gangsters to an unidentified South American country.  It is there where the main action picks up, and Brown becomes ""black Bond"", alternately having cordial discussions with-- then deadly shootouts with-- his quarry (yes, there is a casino sequence.) The love interest here is Stella Stevens, a stunning Southern beauty who was a veteran of assorted 1960s-era dramas.
The second film, "".... Big Rip-Off"" covers familiar territory, only the initial victim is a buddy of Slaughter who apparently catches some bullets meant for the hero.  Seems like the Mob folks from the first film-- rather, higher-ups in the organization who weren't on hand to get killed by Slaughter in the first film-- have put out a revenge hit on him.  The syndicate consigliere of this film is iconic ""Tonight Show"" announcer Ed McMahon, who plays against his wholesome image here as a ruthless crime lord.  Hilarious bit parts are helmed by Scatman Crothers and Dick Anthony Williams as a numbers man and a pimp, respectively.  Black-action genre veteran Gloria Hendry is the love interest.  ""Rip-Off"" is almost as good as the first, though it lacks the international backdrop.

Early 1970s social politics (black civil rights, class mobility, women's rights) heavily inform these movies.  Both films are chock-full of macho men, sexy woman, jive talk, and politically incorrect ethnic jabs.  They are solid examples of well-executed B-movies.  Worth picking up, especially for the bargain price.",1417046400,3,2841,5.315436241610739
