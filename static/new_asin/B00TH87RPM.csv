7009626,5,B00TH87RPM,My favorite band. This one is more electric than accustic. A nice difference. Sad to say without T-Bone...,1429056000,2,106,4.944444444444445

7009628,5,B00TH87RPM,Wish I could give it an 11 to cancel out the person that gave 1 star..there is no excuse for that. It was AWESOME.,1428883200,3,114,3.7916666666666665
7009629,5,B00TH87RPM,Went and saw them last year at the Mountain Winery and this is about the same set list. It makes a great souvenir. Sound and video are excellent. First time I saw them is a little club in San Francisco the Old Waldorf. They seem to age like fine wine. Always a good show. Glad they finally put out a blu ray. Enjoy!,1428624000,3,315,4.015873015873016
7009630,5,B00TH87RPM,"My hometown guys (well they grew up in suburban Philly) have travelled the world in the 42 years since they released the Whole Oats album but, surprisingly, they never played in Ireland  at least not until last July (2014) when that made up for it by performing at a club in Dublin. And the full concert  including TWO encores (that add 27 more minutes to the basic concert  for a total of 97 minutes) was captured in HD video and was released this month by Eagle Rock in two different physical packages: a single Bluray disc or a combo DVD plus two audio CDs. Both contain the same bonus features.

All (well practically all) of their hits are here, starting off with Maneater and ending with a version of I Cant Go For That (No Can Do), that seems to go on forever (with band solos and having the audience singing along). The set list is really a retrospective of their albums (Daryl announces the album from which each song was taken before they play it). The musicians in the band have been with these guys for a long time particularly Charlie DeChant who adds the sax and flute notes so integral to the H&O sound (and has been with them since they formed their backing band in 1976).

The camera work is great as is the sound. Even if you are sitting, your feet will be tapping along to H&Os white soul sound.

The DVD includes two bonus interviews with Daryl and John. The first discusses the musicians in there band (some of who gravitated to H&O from the Average White Band. It runs seven minutes. The second (also seven minutes) talks about why they finally came to Dublin and how the crowd reacted. The first interview adds info, while Im not sure the second one does. Theres not a lot of H&O on home video and  this one is fairly current, having only been recorded within the last nine months.

The packaging is in the same type (and size) as a CD-digipak and there is a an 8- page booklet of credits, photos and a two-page essay inserted in one of the slots.

H&O fans will enjoy this a lot  especially the solo breaks  and I can highly recommend it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7009633,5,B00TH87RPM,"I am stilling smiling at seeing the Boys doing their thing for the first time ever in Dublin. This DVD is from July 2014 the show is all early Daryl & John. Even Mr. Casual Charlie DeChant brought a smile to my face. The song list is early Hall & Oates from the 70s and 80s. For a long long time fan of Boys this is pure joy!

7009635,5,B00TH87RPM,"I have followed and attended many concerts of Hall and Oates through the last 4 decades. They have the ability to express in their music the ""Philly R & B"" roots that brought them into their musical careers. The Live in Dublin  DVD is A MUST HAVE !

It gave me the chills watching it many times and even though Hall & Oates are in the twilight of their career, they are still making incredible music, surrounded by an incredible band of musicians and the singing is still out of this world!  I am just happy that they released this Live in Dublin because I will now do my best to catch them in concert, the first since I saw them in 1983 on the H20 Tour at Pine Knob (Detroit area).",1464566400,,575,4.098214285714286

The DVD sounds great, but the CDs were recorded too loud, but that is nothing new since no one seems to care about good dynamic range anymore.  A great jam on ""I Can't Go For That"" and a good mix of their hits. 4 stars only because the CDs are too loud.",1436313600,,342,4.0

7009711,4,B00TH87RPM,"I had heard a recent interview with Hall and Oates on the Howard Stern show. They spoke of this concert DVD they had recorded in Dublin, Ireland. I am more of a hard rock guy, but I thought I would purchase the DVD for my wife and I watch and reminisce of the late 70's and 80's.

The Blu-ray has very high quality video, but the audio level of the introduction portion of the disk is off. The audio level is way too high and is distorted, do not turn on your surround sound system until you are past this section of the disk. I have played the disk on two different machines and experienced the same issue.

The concert footage is very good. It is easy to tell that Hall and Oates enjoy their music. I was able to revisit some of my younger years as I watched and listened to the Blu-ray disk.

I recommend this Blu-ray / DVD to anyone who wants to remember their  life from yesteryear. The songs will definitely take you back and the disk is well put together other than the problem with the audio level at the introduction / set-up screen.

I would give the disk a five star rating, but honestly the audio problem at the introduction screen should have been caught prior to final release.",1430611200,15,1191,4.275555555555556
