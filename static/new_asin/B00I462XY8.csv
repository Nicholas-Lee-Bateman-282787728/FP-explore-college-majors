6249469,4,B00I462XY8,"3 1/2 to 4 STARS -- FILLED WITH SYMBOLISM, THOUGHT, AND LIFE MESSAGES .... IF A LITTLE TOO CONVOLUTED AT TIMES

NOTE: There is a fair amount of division regarding this anime (and it is different). I have attempted to describe it for both those who will like the show and those who will not. Please accept this attempt to help both sides and allow each individual decide for themselves.  There are many legitimate ways to view this anime.

I like a complex anime that has a lot more effort and thought put into it. This excellent but imperfect example definitely fits into that category and I can appreciate it for the areas where it succeeds. Some viewers simply won't connect with it and their concerns are valid. It is filled with imagery and symbolism borrowed from other religions simply as a creative device. The religions in this anime are definitely their own, but are meant as a homily and analogy for world religions in general. That sounds ambitious and that is definitely what this anime is. This story attempts to craft a purpose for life echoed by religion, and yet contrasting religion. It is well meaning, but a little cheesy at the end.

THE PLOT: This is hard to define in this case, but I will keep it relatively simple. When people die, their lives are condensed into a book that is more like a stone tablet (it is extracted from their chest). It is read by touching it and seeing the story of that person's life through visions. These books are collected from deceased persons and stored in the Bantorra Library. The Bantorra Library is protected by what they call Armed Librarians who all have individual powers and fighting skills. Bantorra is also somewhat like it's own country or city state and is led by the current Acting Director Hamyuts Meseta. The actual Director, named Ruruta Coozancoona, lies at the heart of the library and factors more into the later part of the story. Meanwhile, Hamyuts Meseta runs the Armed Librarians and is secretly committing atrocities to accomplish her aims. She works for good, but seems to have an evil side. She also cannot be killed save by one person which we are never quite sure of through most of the story. Contrasting this all is an evil organization, the cult like Shindeki Church, which is fighting against the Armed Librarians using tactics that include biological weapons and human bombs. The human bombs are people called MEATS who have been conditioned to believe they are not human and carry a bomb device in their chest. It is revealed to the viewer that both the leadership of the Armed Librarians - and the Shindeki Church are protecting many of the same secrets from the rest of the world. What are these secrets? What is the origin of the Shindeki Church and why does it fight against the Librarians? Who will ultimately be the savior of the world that is created over and over due to the mistakes of man? Who can kill Hamyuts Meseta? What is the Heaven? This convoluted tail is somewhat put back together again in the end if you stick with it.

THE GOOD: Many characters are very compelling and interesting. The relationships at times are beautiful as well. Plenty of good messages are projected in the different chapters, though they can be contrasted with the bad. The worlds they create are many layered as are the storylines. The animation is beautiful in that it creates nice scenes, beautiful architecture and attractive, compelling characters. It can be a little simplistic in drawing the minute details like facial features though.

THE LESS GOOD: The story tries to be so complex that the tangents don't come back together well sometimes. Characters that seem very important early on are merely side dressing for illustrating points while other characters seemingly unimportant emerge later to have significant roles. Lets call it - too many red herrings. You will have to mentally earmark the fire hose of characters, devices, organizations etc... just to keep track of them. The naming is alien in that it doesn't seem to correspond to any one specific language - English - Japanese - Italian - Egyptian or other. Names seem picked with random syllables that are reminiscent of languages we understand, but don't register well. This makes it all the more difficult to keep track. The ""chapters"" of this book, that the viewer is actually participating in, flip around so much that the threads linking them are not always well defined, leaving the viewer backtracking to mentally put it together.

For those who just want to sit back and be entertained, this is probably not a good anime. If you are willing to put concerted effort into paying attention and enjoy intelligent anime, this may be for you. I don't know if the payoff is equal to the effort, but I still think this is an excellent anime. I suggest a rental, but you will have to watch the whole thing. It's impossible to draw any conclusions off just a few episodes.",1404432000,,4921,4.748538011695906
8639107,3,B00I462XY8,"After hearing nothing but praise from fans of the series, I finally decided to give The Book of Bantorra a try and was literally stunned by what I saw,...

though not in a positive way.

To begin with The Book of Bantorra is literally set in a completely different world; when someone dies their soul doesnt go to Heaven or Hell, it comes back as a book, a book that reveals their innermost thoughts and can be read by anyone.  Protecting these priceless treasures is the organization known as the Armed Librarians, and this is their story.

Would that it made any sort of sense.

The problems begin with the books themselves.  All sorts of interesting possibilities come to mind, the series suggests some, others will occur to you, but all that is shown is reading memories.  Frankly, I just expected more from the concept than convenient flashbacks.

Second, are the Armed Librarians themselves.  Their powers are wildly different and astonishingly unique, as are their personalities, ranging from noble idealist and sweet and gentle encourager to vicious and psychotic lunatic.  Unfortunately, it is never clear how these wildly different people can even hold a conversation with each other, much less loyally support each other and work together, and this gets to the heart of the problem: the lack of time.  There are only 27 half hour episodes, and most of them appear to take place at a dead run.  Viewers are encouraged to rewatch the show because so many secrets are revealed the first time through, but I honestly don't think it will help much because most of them aren't much explained.

Finally, we come to the biggest problem: this may be the stupidest religion Ive ever heard of.  Three gods made out of one (make note of that) are trying to get imperfect, idiotic humans to grasp even a clue; they are currently on their 694th attempt (insert gales of hopeless, helpless laughter here).  Gee, do you think they MIGHT be starting to go through the motions a bit here in discouragement?  Such at least is suggested by their conscious attempt to destroy this 694th world (Did they succeed the first 693 times, or is this the first time they gave up and tried destruction?)  Unfortunately, this time they failed, losing to Ruruta Coozancoota, who in victory proceeds to bollix things up spectacularly, making such a gargantuan mess that it falls to the dead characters we know in the current age (and there are a lot of them by now) to straighten the idiot out (without regaining their lives, of course).  Seriously, this is it?  A world in which the best and the brightest, the noblest and the kindest, live miserably and pointlessly with nothing to hope for but a sorrowful yet meaningful death that opens a path to a small ray of hope in the world?

Compared to this even godless Atheism is triumphantly hopeful or maybe Christianity.

I could not help but notice the three gods out of one pattern, a crazy idea pretty much unique to Christianity, and I started doing some comparisons.  In the Bible three gods in one: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, decided to create a world and create humanity, despite knowing with absolute certainty ahead of time that wed screw it up, but They had a different cockamamie fallback plan.  Instead of try, try, trying again (for the 694th time!) like in The Book of Bantorra, They came up with this ahead of that first and only attempt: at a certain time the second god, God the Son, would arrange to be born as a human, to live the perfect life that we are all capable of, to teach us His lessons, and then at the end to die innocently from the most horrific execution possible, personally experiencing all of the agony, and then rising from the dead to offer us the Deal: accept His death as payment for our sins.  Now, you still have to make a leap of faith, but at least this religion isn't a farce, a parody, a joke like that in The Book of Bantorra, and if it turns out to be true, what God could possibly love His creation more?",1527638400,,3995,4.618104667609618

8639109,3,B00I462XY8,"This DVD may not be for everyone. Very complex story with rough & tumble episodes. One of those lengthy fables that you might have to ""re-watch"" one or twice to grasp all of the details of story. Characters are interesting, but don't get too attached to them, as they kill off most of them as the story winds down. Good graphics with several ""star"" voice over actors playing key roles. Not for anyone under 16.",1461974400,,410,4.48

8639113,4,B00I462XY8,"My thanks for the comment from A. J. Abadsafian bringing out that this is a product review and not a seller or shipping review as I had posted it. I apologize for the slip up. As for the product review, the discs and case are normal and average. They come packaged as most anime Blu-ray titles, and with both subtitles and dubbed versions. This anime quality is about average which in my book gets it 4 stars. I subtract one star because the plot gets erratic. The story line wanders around a lot, and due to that I have yet to finish watching the series. For a series of this size that says a lot, since I bought this back in March of 2015 that puts it over the 4 month mark and counting. I can knock out 26 episodes in 2 weekends easy. The episodes are pretty disturbing and the little regard for life may be one reason that I am really only able to take a couple of episodes a week. I may change my mind on this review as I get closer to the end, but I don't see going back up to 4 stars yet.",1429660800,,995,4.005025125628141
