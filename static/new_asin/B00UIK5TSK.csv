8706967,3,B00UIK5TSK,"Poor production quality, poor color etc.
Only Robert Newton saved it. I am a Newton fan, especially Blackbeard.
Also, Long John Silver and Long John Silver Returns to Treasure Island are THE SAME MOVIE.
Don't get ripped off, buy one or the other.",1493078400,,246,4.744186046511628
8706968,4,B00UIK5TSK,"Enjoyable movie.  Long John Silver played by Robert Newton is a classic.  Robert Newton is the most convinceable pirate and makes this movie.  He has very shifty eyes, changes his story to fit the circumstances - favorable to him, and plays a great scoundrel/hero character!",1483747200,,274,5.044444444444444
