6155024,3,B00HDKYEY8,"The Immigrant is a very interesting storyline but it failed to thrill the audiences with the kind of gravity it should have. You see, the characters played by the protagonist and even the supporting actor are such where you are made to feel ""something is coming"" and there will be something that will change the course of their personalities. This is largely a film about the struggles of a woman in desperate times, in a new country and so forward. However, while the acting was tolerable, the plot was good, the characters and the direction didn't allow them to move the audiences enough to make this memorable. Even an hour into the film the protagonist will seem ""new"" to you. Phoenix's character has moods as though a desperate attempt has been made to make him as indecipherable as he was in say THE MASTER. By the end, I had given up any hope of an upheaval of sorts. Do you read how my review is? Yes, this is what THE IMMIGRANT deserves. Watch if you are as curious as me about Joaquin Phoenix. For a better Marion Cotillard film, watch RUST AND BONE.",1404172800,6,1060,4.4974093264248705
6155025,4,B00HDKYEY8,"""Low Life"" and ""The Nightingale"" were the working titles of director and writer James Gray's 2013 film ""The Immigrant"", which tells a hard story of life of immigrants to America in 1921. With the film's emphasis on New York City street life and on the efforts of a beautiful young woman to survive, both working titles are appropriate for the film, separately or together. The film showed at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and received a nomination for the highest award, the Palme D'Or, but is only now coming to theaters. The slow, introspective character of this film makes a large popular success unlikely.

The film begins and ends at Ellis Island. The primary character, Ewa Cybulski, (Marion Cottilard) has fled Poland with her sister, Magda, in search of a new, better life in America. At Ellis Island, Magda is quarantined for lung disease, and Ewa is about to be deported over rumors that she has proved to be a loose woman on board the ship. Ewa, a Catholic, is rescued from deportation at the last moment by a debonair Jewish man, Bruno Weiss, (Joaquin Phoenix) who offers her a place to stay and a job as a seamstress.  The job soon deteriorates into work in a chorus line in which the women show themselves and, more importantly, engage in prostitution. Ewa seethes with anger but accepts her lot as a prostitute to earn the money to rescue her sister. She dislikes Bruno, a mean, despicable pimp yet strangely vulnerable and in love with her. When Eva again faces deportation at Ellis Island, she meets a cheap magician and comedian, Orlando the Magician/Emil (Jeremy Renner) who also happens to be  Bruno's cousin.  In an ironic, raw story, the two men compete for Ewa's affections. Ewa tries to keep focused on her life and on her goals for her sister while despising herself for her degrading circumstances, some of which she has brought upon herself. In a climactic moment of the film, Ewa goes to confession in an effort to gain forgiveness, catharsis, and a new start.

This film is a beautifully done period piece with scenes of New York slums in the Five Points area, tawdry clubs, and vulgar people. Much of the film is shot in sepia browns and grays. The movie also features large sweeping shots of Ellis Island and shows the processes the newcomers to the United States endured. Marion Cottilard plays her role with beautiful restraint and with body language, especially with the fire in her eyes. Each of the three primary characters, Ewa, Bruno, and Emil, are complex, multi-dimensional figures developed from the inside.  The passion in the film is captured by the operatic score, including a cameo impersonation of the great Caruso. The plot is cumbersome and full of coincidence.  It develops slowly.

In the character of Ewa, the movie emphasizes the sometimes elusive character of the American dream, as she is forced to sell her body to survive in a strange land under bad circumstances. But the film also emphasizes hope and staying true to one's goals in the middle of adversity. Each of the characters in the film have their sympathetic sides, even the dastardly pimp.

This is a thoughtful, beautiful film. It will appeal to viewers who enjoyed films such as ""Once upon a time in America"", ""The Gangs of New York"", or ""Mean Streets"".  In its own unique way, the film captures the fascination the immigrant experience and the streets of New York continue to exert on many Americans.

6155026,4,B00HDKYEY8,"""The Immigrant"" (2013 release; 95 min.) brings the story of a young Polish woman, Ewa (played by Marion Cotillard), who arrives with her sickly sister at Ellis Island in January, 1921. With her sister quarantined, Ewa is about to be deported herself, until at the last minute she gets rescued, on account of her good looks and English language capabilities, by Bruno Weiss (played by Joaquin Phoenix). Weiss is running a vaudeville show/cabaret of sorts and before long, Ewa is forced to participate (and worse). In a parallel story line, we get to know Orlando the magician (played by Jeremy Renner), who also has his eyes on beautiful Ewa. To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: I had not heard of this movie, despite its star power, and noticed it when I was in Belgium for a family visit last Fall. Given the stellar cast and the topic (being a legal immigrant into the US myself), I had no hesitation about seeing this. Great acting performances indeed abound (Cotillard seems well on her way to becoming a Hollywood regular), but it turns out this movie is a lavish production with a seriously flawed script. There are plot holes the size of Manhattan, which you can gloss over if you are in a kind mood. A plus point is surely the gorgeous way in which the movie is photographed. Completely aside, contrary to what is listed on IMDb and on other information sites (like the Belgian movie theater's site), the running time of the movie is not 120 min., in fact it's not anywhere close and it is more something like 95 min., at least the version that I saw in Belgium last November.

Bottom line: this movie is worth checking out for the acting performances but I don't know that I can recommend you go spend money on this in the theater. The movie is being released in US theaters this very weekend, but if I were you, I'd probably wait for the DVD/Blu-ray or Video on Demand release of ""The Immigrant"".",1400803200,15,2029,4.586776859504132

6155028,5,B00HDKYEY8,I found this movie very moving. My Polish and Italian grandparents came through Ellis Island and this movie echoed some of what they described. James Gray's narrative in the extras about his writing this movie based on his Jewish family's stories amplifies on immigrants experiences. Anyone who has family members who emigrated in the early 1900's will appreciate the strength and determination that gave their children a better life.  My Polish grandmother once described running from Russian Cossacks and there is a scene in the movie where a scene is recreated of A similar incident. The scene gave me chills because the portrayal of terror allowed me to experience in some small way what it must have been like!,1464048000,,715,5.008403361344538

6155034,4,B00HDKYEY8,"Did not really hold my interest. I had expected it to be more pronounced. The female lead is beautiful, and her soulful eyes are quite haunting; but the film, overall, did not meet my expectations. I really wanted to see the male lead in an excellent role, for he has been criticized publicly for years, although I saw him in a period performance with Russell Crowe, in which he was superb in his role. Wish I could give this movie five stars, but I simply cannot. I recommend it for a rainy afternoon, when perhaps the viewer wants a more relaxing film. Certainly, there was action in this film and some violence (violence I can do without), but some of the story lines did not seem realistic to me. As a friend once told me, after I had expected a film to be truly realistic, ""It is only a movie."" Still, I expected a little more from this film than I received. I do not regret watching it, but I would not care to see it again. That is how I measure the success of a film: that I would love to watch it again. For example, I've seen GOND WITH THE WIND more than 60 times. After that many viewings over the years, I stopped counting.

Joaquin Phoenix always mesmerizes - he just interprets a character his own way, fascinating actor, unique.  Marion Cotillard probably should have been nominated for an Oscar for this performance. Why the producers (??) or studio that made it failed to market and promote it correctly is beyond me. Fine, complicated characters in no-win situations; difficult issues that still need to be addressed in the America of 2015 - immigration laws, the vulnerability of refugees, the motives of people who take advantage of those refugees (including using them for the sex trade) - these are all things that still trouble us and that need addressing. I found the moral issues to be well handled, complex, not approached in a shallow way. And the sets and lighting and costumes - absolutely beautiful, delicate, somber, golden. Maybe not a perfect movie, but how many movies are perfect? And just in terms of whether it's worth renting and watching - wow, absolutely!",1421452800,2,1129,5.037433155080214
6155069,5,B00HDKYEY8,"Sometimes you start watching a movie and you are instantly transported to another time, another place, and you just know that the film is doing its job.  Youre invested.  Other times, you put on a film and you're brought to another time and place in relation to your own life.  Youre given this nostalgic feeling that coats the way you embrace the film.  It touches you because it causes you to remember fonder times.  Still, other times, you put on a film and it transports you to another time and place with regard to cinema itself.  It recalls a past era of filmmaking, a time when films were crafted differently.

The Immigrant kind of does all three of those things.

For me, The Immigrant reminds me very much of a period film made in the 80s.  There is this overcoat of steamy, almost palpable sensuality that reminds me a lot of the soap operatic tones of many 80s films.  It isn't theatrical, but then again most of those films weren't either.  They were suppressed in a way, and yet they exuded this cinematic sweat, if you can call it that.  The cinematography, use of light and color (all that yellow and orange) also call to mind the 80s.  There is a musky vibrancy, an almost muted light that actually glistens on every frame.  There is no denying that the film takes place in the 20s, for the world, that time, is captured with such authenticity, and yet the filmmaking feels like an homage to a much later time, when filmmaking was beginning to shift.

Growing up in the 80s, early 90s, I found myself recalling those night, nestled on the couch with my older sisters, as we secretly took in all those films my parents deemed too heavy for us.  I felt myself overcome by that warmth, that nostalgia.

The Immigrant tells a story of a young polish woman, Ewa, trapped by circumstance as she enters American with her sick sister.  Her sister, detained at Ellis Island due to her assumed illness, is scared and alone.  Ewa attempts to leave herself, but due to a rumor about her conduct aboard the ship, she is deemed a woman of loose morals and sentenced to deportation.  That is when she meets Bruno, a seemingly kind hearted man who strikes a deal to get Ewa released into America.  He then offers her a place to live and a job as a seamstress.  Ewa is initially weary, but she begins to trust Bruno.  Then things change.  Brunos intentions become clear as it is made known the truth about his business, the girls he orders around and the jobs they perform.  Ewa doesnt want any part of this world, but she has her sister to think about, and soon she is coerced into a life of prostitution.

While The Immigrant could have easily been nothing more than a scenario type film (one of those movies that tells a simple story, nothing more), it truly proves to be so much more than that.  While telling a story about a womans struggle to establish a life for herself and save the one she loves most, her sister, the film also delves into some weighty ideas on love, loyalty and obsession.  I was truly intrigued by the development of Bruno, a man who seems like a sly and manipulative man and yet his character arc towards the end, his selflessness, really created such complex layers.  This was not an easy character, not an easy feeling, and I applaud James Gray (who wrote and directed this film) for not shooting for a lazy stereotype.  Bruno does some awful things, but Gray erases all black and white from this film and simply gives us a lot ofgrey.

The film is technically perfect, but not in a way that feels stale or too clinical.  There is no coldness here.  The film, from start to finish, is laced with this undeniable warmth.  You can feel the emotion exuding from every character, every situation, every frame.  The performances are stellar here.  Renner, who has a supporting role as a traveling magician with a sordid past and eyes for Ewa, is convincing and engaging.  He has a tricky and almost thankless role, one that could have become a gimmick, and yet he sells his scenes and even creates an edge of mystery that leaves the audience guessing as to his real intentions as well.  But really, this is all about Joaquin Phoenix (who is really establishing a revitalized career for himself) and Marion Cotillard (not only the best working actress, but easily the most interesting and varied).  These two are sensational here.  Phoenix has a lot more at stake, for his characters arc would not work without a richly developed performance, and he sells it and then some.  Still, Cotillard simply IS Ewa.  She melts into every frame, embracing this character and transcending the screen.  Her eyes milk out every ounce of backstory, but in such a reflective and progressive way.  You never once detect an actress here, for she is simply an impoverished immigrant grounded by her dire circumstance.

Honestly, this is one of the very best films Ive seen this year; a true triumph of technical, emotional and artistic filmmaking.  This is a film with a beating heart and a warm soul, a film that reminds us all why filmmaking is all about storytelling, and how sitting down to watch a good movie can feel so much like reading a good book.",1421020800,2,5163,4.5630434782608695

The two are about to be deported when Ewa runs into a white knight Bruno Weiss (Joaquim Phoenix) offering her home and security, while arranging for Magda to be hospitalized. The offer turns out to be double-edged, as Ewa is unwillingly forced into prostitution. Bruno has an unhealthy obsession with her, as does his cousin Emil (Jeremy Renner), and the two end up in a fatal confrontation.

Such is the plot-line of James Gray's lushly photographed and scrupulously staged melodrama that works hard to recreate the atmosphere of early Twenties New York in the throes of Prohibition, when everyone, it seems, has their price - the police, the bourgeoisie, members of the prison services. Bruno thrives in this kind of environment - a would-be impresario working at what he describes as a ""theater"" but is in truth a burlesque with a brothel attached, he takes pleasure in presenting his ""girls"" in a variety of grotesque pageants. As a well-brought up Catholic girl Magda cannot and will not accept what she is asked to do, even though she knows this is the only way for her to raise money to pay for her sister's hospital care.

The plot unfolds at a snail's pace, concentrating more on Bruno's degenerating state of mind as his obsession with Magda becomes more and more unhealthy. In the end he keeps her as a physical and emotional prisoner; even when she does try to escape him, he keeps coming back unexpectedly. Joachim Phoenix registers his state of mind through a range of facial expressions, coupled with outstanding eye-work, as he looks wildly round to see if anyone is trying to steal Magda from him.

In contrast Cotillard and Renner offer low-key characterizations; they are much more concerned with the day-to-day business of survival in an amoral world. Cotillard's countenance seldom changes; she has encased herself in a protective emotional shell and refuses to emerge from it until the every end when she is restored to her sister. Emil (who performs under the moniker Orlando the magician) has a specialty act where is quite literally disappears onstage; this serves as a suitable visual metaphor for a world where the dispossessed quite literally disappear from public view into dark tunnels and seedy tenement- blocks.

While THE IMMIGRANT might not have too much to say about human relationships, it deserves praise for the way it shows the protagonists struggling to survive in post-World War One America, a time that historians tell us was perceived by the bourgeois as one of freedom and hedonism (fueled by the bootleggers), but was certainly not the same for those existing further down the social scale.",1469059200,,2796,4.993562231759657
8631686,4,B00HDKYEY8,"The Immigrant is an unabashedly old-fashioned melodrama. It is also an excellent movie. Even the look of the film (the cinematography, the scenography) has the feeling of a 1930's movie. The three main actors, Marion Cotillard, Joaquin Phoenix and Jeremy Renner are very good in their roles. Although after having seen so many movies with Joaquin Phoenix interpreting people with different kinds of mental diseases, I wonder if he can really do anything else. Very impressive work by James Gray, the director.",1466208000,,509,5.219512195121951
