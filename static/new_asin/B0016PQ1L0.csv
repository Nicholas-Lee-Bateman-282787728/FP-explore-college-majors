8264029,5,B0016PQ1L0,"I first saw this video 15 years ago when I was going through a transition phase of my life which started as a result of an injury.  As I was just starting to push through the ""doom and gloom"" and take on new challenges, I found this video by chance.  I was powerfully affected by its imagery and message.  I watched it over and over, and really clicked with the symbol and image of the magestic bald eagle.  To this day, the Eagle evokes in me an image of character, perserverence, courage, fortitude, strength and nobility that I aspire to in my life's roles.  This video wonderfully depicts these timeless, universal themes that add purpose and meaning to our lives.  I have shared this video with many through the years.  I find that most people are ""wowed"" by it, and inspired to different degrees depending upon where they are in their own life journey.",1325548800,,858,4.532467532467533

You should be ashamed of yourself if this crap inspired you to do anything in life.  Useless video garbage, 18,000,000 thumbs down.",1306454400,,325,4.785714285714286
