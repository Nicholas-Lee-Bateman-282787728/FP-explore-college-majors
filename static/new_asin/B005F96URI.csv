4673004,5,B005F96URI,"Honestly, The main reason I bought Bunraku was to support my favorite Japanese musician, GACKT who stars as Yoshi in Bunraku. I didn't hold out much hope for the rest of the movie based on critic reviews.

But I sat down and watched it, and honestly, I really really liked it. Not to say the movie isn't flawed. the beginning is a bit campy and confusing. I didn't know where they were going with anything until almost 15 minutes in. The way they introduced and built the characters up could have been done much better.

However, once you got passed the corny introductions to the characters, and figured out what the heck was going on... the rest fell into place nicely.

Josh Hartnett filled the role of ""The Drifter"" very well. he brought a bit of realism to what could best be described as a comic book character. There were moments where he made you laugh, like a scene where he has to use a trapeze. I really enjoyed the fight scenes with ""The Drifter"". They were exciting... Josh Hartnett was right on in his interpretation of the character.

I think Woody Harrelson did a great job as the bartender. He seemed to fit the role perfectly, and I'm not talking about his bartending stint on 'Cheers'. (I was too little to really appreciate his time on that show - lol). what I liked about Harrelson in this movie... He has this sort of wisdom in his eye, and cunningly knowing smile. He really stuck out to me in this movie. I have to say, I have a new found respect for Harrelson as an actor after this role.

Gackt surprised me. I'm a big fan of his music, and I liked him in Furin Kazan (a Japanese Samurai period piece)... however, I didn't know how he would handle the transition to and English speaking Hollywood movie. Surprisingly, his acting is very good. he wasn't over the top nor was he too understated. He made the character realistic and likable. You would never guess by watching this movie that this was his first Hollywood movie, or that he didn't have a large list of acting credits under his belt. There were a few times I had to remind myself that I was watching GACKT, because he brings you into his character. He really did a great job.

There were a few things I didn't like, or at least, that disappointed me a bit. Nicola (the main baddie played brilliantly by Ron Perlman) and Alexandra (played also brilliantly by Demi Moore) were not properly utilized in the movie. There was so much that could have been done with both characters... I feel there were missed opportunities. Especially when we learn WHO Alexandra has a history with, and considering Nicola is the most feared, and most dangerous man that few dare stand up to him... once you see the movie, you'll spot a few places where the opportunities were missed... So I won't go into it further as to not spoil you.

So all in all, this was an excellent movie. Yes there are some flaws, but none that seriously effect the watch-ability of this movie. I would say this is going to be a fan classic fairly quickly. if you like Samurai movies or Westerns, or if you liked Sin City... I think you'll like this movie. Its the kind of movie you can appreciate more the second and third time around. I'd say it's definitely worth the purchase.",1320969600,6,3223,4.47108843537415
4673005,1,B005F96URI,"I sat through this at a film festival last year and everyone in the audience I spoke with afterward agreed that this may be the one of the worst films of all time.  It is boring, moronic, and clueless.  The only thing it has going for it is a nice visual flair... which gets you through about ten minutes.  Everyone involved in the making of this atrocity should be ashamed.  I can only believe the good reviews on here are from plants... and I don't mean studio plants, I mean potted plants, because even studio shills have standards.",1320710400,5,535,4.428571428571429
4673006,4,B005F96URI,"This appears to be another take on genre-crossing in a genre-style movie.  Previous examples include the wildly successful Sin City movies, popular western splices like The Good The Bad and The Weird and The Warrior's Way, and the stillborn Sucker Punch.  But all these movies were well-advertised and wide theatrical releases (in Asia, at least, for The Good The Bad and The Weird).  Should I approach this lack of advertising as a snake's rattle and keep my expectations low?  When I stumbled across this I thought ""This movie features Josh Hartnett, Demi Moore, Ron Perlman, Woody Harrelson and Kevin McKidd, and I had never heard of it or saw a trailer.  How does that happen?  Is this a weird little gem waiting to be discovered, or an utter Sucker Punch tragedy?""

 The opening credits are cleverly presented during an animated story background.  The style was much like that of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One or Hellboy 2: The Golden Army.  When moviemakers really care about a movie, they make an effort to have the opening credits ""affect"" the viewer somehow.  Even if it's only music over a black screen, moods are set and pace is foreshadowed.  I've commented on the great opening credits of The Good The Bad and The Weird, and that movie was awesome.  This made for a promising start.

 In this perhaps futuristic world guns have somehow been banned, making way for a resurgence in swordsmanship and a feudal yakuza-esque gang culture.  A young, Doc Holidayish brawler (Hartnett) and a swordless samurai team up to exact their revenge against the ruthless king of the hill, ""The Woodsman"" (Perlman).  To do so, they must kill their way through leagues of henchman and his nine right hand men, one of which is played by a sleek Kevin McKidd.

This film is VERY stylistic.  The effects and music smack of Scott Pilgrim versus The World with comic book stylings of villainy and storyline much like Kill Bill.  The combat follows suit, with choreography focusing more on a dance-like technical precision than producing a realistic fight.  It's more like theater than cinema.  In fact, the set designers erected intentionally artificial-looking structures in order to unsubtly accent this feeling.  Sets and wardrobe contain elements of the present, the future, the old west, and the early 1900's.  Many theatrical devices are employed as well.  All of this synergistically produces an other-worldly feel.

The style of this movie is rare and difficult to execute.  The fights are fun, the scenes are clever, and (with the exception of Demi Moore's role) the characters were interesting.  If you are careful about your expectations, this movie could be a great pick for you.",1320537600,31,2696,4.944320712694878
4673007,5,B005F96URI,"Watched ""Bunraku"" last night. I think it is awesomer than awesome! The animation is stunning, and combined with live action, is pretty incredible. Yeah, I know there are lots of movies that do that, but the art style and the physical sets are beautiful. I've read some really negative reviews for this film, and I don't think they get it! It's a ""graphic novel"" style movie, but the best one I've seen. You could pause on any frame of the film, and it looks like a graphic novel. The lighting and art direction are spectacular. It's like ""live"" Anime! So ignore the reviews, and watch the film!",1320537600,5,594,4.5607476635514015
4673008,5,B005F96URI,"Don't worry about the plot- it's the same plot of most of the Westerns, space operas, and other action films ever made. The narrator breaks that 4th wall for you immediately, so you can focus on the stagecraft.  And it's glorious- the origami meets art deco sets that shift and fold, the references to old video games, the acrobatic fight scenes...and so much more.  It calls for multiple viewings to process even half of it. Next time I watch it I'll be trying to concentrate on what's going on in the fight scenes around the combatants, and then I'll watch again to focus on the anime-like aspects.  This movie is going straight to cult status.  My only disappointment was Josh Hartnett's acting.  There was room in the role for an Eastwood-like ambivalence, but Hartnett's drifter doesn't have that depth.",1320451200,4,808,4.784172661870503
4673009,5,B005F96URI,"Everything just works right with this movie.
The actors all work in there indivisible roles perfectly.
The choreography and action sequences are well done and cool.
The cinematography is unique and original and well thought out.
It's great you should watch it now.",1319846400,2,264,5.162790697674419
4673010,4,B005F96URI,"Just your basic noir, German Expressionist, samurai comicbook-come-to-life kind of movie - but absolutely incredible. If there ever was a wall between live action and animated movies, it's gone now. Clever animated interludes separate each big sequence from the next, but the artwork stays on in the skies and backgrounds of the live action. Even the supposedly photographic sequences have been color-shifted and manipulated into brilliant hues and moody darks - eye-popping chromatics keep the viewer visually entertained to the end. Then, there are visual references to more classic films than I can hope to name, including an apparent reference to Dr. Strangelove on one motorcycle's license plate. But, if you're looking for action, wonderfully choreographed comedic fight scenes approach Jackie Chan's best.

Plot? Motivation? Characterization? Well, not so much, but let's not dwell on that. The visual spectacle makes this worthwhile.

4673011,3,B005F96URI,"First off all let me get a pet peeve about how this movie is presented out of the way. Now this is presented as a western/Martial Arts science fiction film, well there is nothing science fiction about this movie, it seams the term science fiction is slapped on anything a little out of the ordinary these days. Bunraku takes place in a world where guns have been outlawed so everyone fights with swords, knives and fists, this is a interesting premise that set the movie up for some great fight scenes but it do not make it science fiction.

Bunrako is a stylized movie that tried to me a mix of a comic book in movie format and a homage to German Expressionism, now this sounds like a odd mix but it works quite well, the visuals of this movie is stunning and it frames the story very well, or to put it in another way had it not been for the stylized atmosphere and visuals this movie would have been rather dull, as it is however Bunrako takes you on a joyride which is pure goodness for the eyes.

The plot of Bunrako is something like this, two men, a drifter and a Japanese Martial Artist comes to a small town that is terrorized by a gang leader named The Woodcutter and his nine killers. Soon our two heroes join up with a local bartender and go after the Woodcutter and his organization for various personal reasons. The plot of this movie is pretty thin and it really fails to capture much interest for me, however the characters and the nicely choreographed fight scenes more than makes up for it. Now let us be honest, this is not a movie you watch if you want a deep and involving storyline, this is the kind of movie you put on when you just want to be entertained by mindless action and people chopping one another's heads off, and this movie give you moping drifters with a sad past, heroic Martial Artists, pretty women, cookie cutter evil villains and enough action to fill all the needs of a popcorn, pizza and a movie night with your friends.

Now one problem I have with this movie is that at times it try so hard to be edgy that it get silly. I get for example that in a movie like this acting have to be over the top, that is part of the style, however there is a fine line where being stylized end and being annoying stars and this movie is over that line a few times. I do however love the details in this film, everything is focused on making it feel like a comic book come to life, from the subtitles when the characters speaks Japanese looking like comic book text boxes to the characters appearances, and the movie even hits at computer games as well with a chase scene having pinball sounds and the whole taking down the killers ones by one and having them crossed of the list and slowing working towards the Woodcutter as the main boss, Bunrako is one geeky little gift box.

I recommend this movie as a rent, the thin story and the fact that the movie drags on that story for nearly two hours without enough material is a ptoblem and also unless you like the style of the movie it falls flat as that is all it got, for those reasons I recommend rent over buy unless you can get it cheap. I however think Bunrako is worth at least being watched once.",1317513600,10,3181,4.27906976744186
4673012,4,B005F96URI,"""Revenge is an act of style."" When a man (Hartnett) bent on revenge come to a city he finds what he is looking for. He begins fighting his way through nine very different and very deadly assassins on his way to the one he want. This is another movie that really surprised me as to how good it was. Having never seen a preview or even really heard about it I had no idea what to expect. While the movie is not that original it takes from many different types of movies and blends them together in a very interesting and exciting way. Some aspects have been taken from ""Scott Pilgrim vs The World"", ""Kill Bill"" and ""Sin City"" just to name a few. This is more like ""Sin City"" then the others in the style that it uses and the ""comic-booky"" feel that it has. The fighting is great, and is refreshing to see an action movie that doesn't rely on guns to make it fun. The cast is great and the movie is very fun, very much worth your time. The only thing that bothered me is that it didn't need to be two hours long. They could have cut at least 15-20 min out and had it move at a more exciting pace. Other then that I really enjoyed this. Overall, a very entertaining way to spend your time and money. I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I don't think so *Also try - Sin City & Tekken",1316649600,9,1281,4.023529411764706

4673021,2,B005F96URI,"I found this bluray for a buck. It looked interesting and had a great cast. Unfortunately the only good acting came from Mckidd. The movie was actually quite boring and I thought about hitting the stop button a few times but it was late and I decided to watch it through to the end just so I could put it on the shelf of watched films to forget about (It's kind of like reading a boring book to help you fall asleed...I slept good after watching this). It's an obvious ripoff of sin city just not in the same league. This movie is rated R but the movie is pretty tame and lackluster with not much gore at all.

Final thought:
They could have saved some money and put this Gackt person in dual roles as the samurai and in demi moore's role as well (Dude looks like a lady).",1470182400,,772,4.1466666666666665

That's not the question to ask here, because aside from mixing genres there is a crazy quilt of styles and homages, from Sin City to stage plays, that make trying to keep track of genres a fools game in the face of everything else going on.
Are there faults? Certainly. Ron Perlman, admirable as he is, can do little with his dialogue, which makes Star Wars seem deep and flowing by comparison. Josh Hartnett was not cut from stoic leading man cloth. And  certainly, the whole thing is carrying at least 20 minutes to much.

Very film noir in nature, the constant narration and background music becomes tiresome. Combining that with the visual look, which is a mix between a comic book and the Bunraku Japanese puppet theater style where this film gets its title from, turns things into a monotonous piece of work. The action contains some promise with the choreography and the bloody violence, for the most part, is held in check; although there is enough to warrant an R rating. Similarly with the film's tone, the performances by the likes of Josh Hartnett, Woody Harrelson, Gackt, and Ron Perlman are all colorless and dry. Kevin McKidd tends to standout from the rest with some spark in his character.

4673118,5,B005F96URI,"I have been meaning to write this review for sometimes now after purchasing this DVD.
I would advise you to do this when first watching this movie

Just watch and enjoy the ride!  Don't nitpick!

Each of the characters I enjoyed during the movie as they come into this odd fantasy
futuristic world where weapons are outlawed.

We meet the Drifter who has an agenda to seek out the great killer Nicola the Woodcutter.
He works by himself and with his wits and fists.

Another also seeks Nicola - the samurai named Yoshi, a slightly nave man who believes
in a sacred code of honor while trying to help his uncle and cousin.

These two meet at a bar where a man named the Bartender asks them to team up to
defeat Nicola.  The bartender is a mysterious quirky man who has a history with
Nicola and seeks to save his town from him.

Nicola is a dangerous man in his own right with his band of nine killers, but now many
years later since establishing his reign, seek to settle down and focus on his legacy.

His woman Alexandra, a fierce woman in her own right, has a secret and seeks to
make a decision on her future.  It would have been interesting to do more with
this character and maybe see her fight.  We do however get a glimpse into her past.

Each of the killers are interesting with what screen time they each have.  (There is
one scene where I thought that the Joker had come out to play - you'll find it!  :)

But Killer #2 has a particular finesse to him - seemingly harmless at first - just a fop
or dandy until he kills. . .

Then it all comes together in an awesome showdown that you just have to see.
Also it would have been interesting to have the cousin Mimoko fight, but seeing
the uncle fight was cool!

4673151,4,B005F96URI,"Bunraku(released Sept/10)stars Josh Hartnett as The Drifter,Woody Harrelson as a Bartender,Gackt as Yoshi,a swordsman from Japan, Kevin McKidd as Killer No. 2,Ron Perlman as Nicola ""the Woodcutter"",Demi Moore as Alexandra,and many others. It is a talented cast in one heck of a stylized film that is allegorical and cliched to the max. But the film knows its allegorical properties and cliches and confronts and embraces them every step of the way. Bunraku of course is an ancient form of Japanese puppetry,and there is much of its essence in this movie also.
The story is one set in a future where anything that shoots a bullet is outlawed. Man has reverted to using swords,axes and other such instruments to kill his fellow man with. Perlman is Nicola,the most powerful man east of the Atlantic. He has a total of nine underlings who do his dirty work for him,McKidd being his #2 man. Nicola also has a courtesan in the form of Moore,who long ago became his own when she had the life of her then lover,Harrelson,spared in exchange for a life time of servitude to him. Harrelson is a bartender now.
Into this climate walks a drifter/loner in the form of Hartnett,and a Japanese swordsman(Gackt)called Yoshi. Both are unknown to each other at first,but both have one thing in common and that is to kill Perlman. Both of their fathers were murdered by Perlman years before. Separately they have little luck infiltrating Nicola's rank and file. When they meet at Harrelson's bar they set upon each other. There is no clear winner except their common purpose,and they vow to work together.
Through alot of trials and tribulations Harrelson eventually introduces them to a secret but ever growing and training army. Its' leader reveals a secret entrance into Perlman's domain. Hartnett and Gackt make their way through some tough challenges until Gackt confronts Nicola's#2,and Hartnett goes on to challenge the top dog. When the dust finally settles and honours are avenged,both men part company and go their separate ways.
As I watched this film I had to make a list of some of the movies that sprang to mind that may have had some influence upon its makers:Batman(the TV show),The Good,The Bad,The Ugly,High Noon,West Side Story,5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.,The Last Samurai,Crouching Tiger-Hidden Dragon,Cool World,anything by Cirque Du Soleil,to name but a few. The Japanese swordsman is named after a Nintendo video game character,of which you will hear such related sounds when the bad guys go down. Hartnett of course is reminiscent of the man with no name Eastwood made popular,and Hartnett stays at the High Noon hotel. Like the Dr Seuss movie ""5,0000 Fingers..."",most buildings are just vague representations invoking a dream like quality in the film. Many of the blows on bodies are accompanied with an emphasis in music at the exact moment,harkening back to Batman;the only difference being there are no ""Pows"" or ""Bams"" on screen. All Japanese spoken is accompanied by English translation vis a vis comic book word balloons. Entire city buildings unfold before us like an opening three dimensional picture book. Some of the choreographed fight sequences are a cross between a Cirque Du Soleil performance and West Side Story. Throw into this every Hong Kong film you may have ever heard about or seen and you will begin to get a glimpse of what this film involves. It is an ultimate film of redemption and revenge and the classic good versus evil dynamic. The major actors of Perlman,Gackt,Hartnett,Harrelson,Moore and McKidd do a bang up job in their respective roles. I can't imagine being the director and having to explain to each actor what their next scene would be about on this baby. There is alot going on and there isn't. This is not a perfect movie by any stretch,but I can dig what the director,producers and writers had in mind and were trying to accomplish in this very ambitious movie. And I would be remiss if I didn't mentioned the constantly changing and always impressive CGI effects.
Technically the movie is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette and cast interviews.
All in all a very ambitious and stylistic film. The acting is solid in this cliche ridden flick that embraces those very things that would doom other films very quickly. It is filled with a myriad of movie and television influences and its allegorical nature will not please everyone. While I found it to be less than perfect,it was quirky and differently entertaining none the less. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1355184000,,4530,4.938401048492792

4673155,3,B005F96URI,"This movie began its journey slowly, making it through production but having a time of getting distribution. When it finally did, the anticipation was high. It looked so good.

Unfortunately, the execution couldn't entirely live up to the anticipation. I won't say this is a bad movie. It was entertaining, had some nice lines and okay fight sequences. The real appeal is in watching the execution of a very eclectic and risky style of filmmaking. In attempting to pay homage while also reinterpreting the artistic and narrative style of bunraku puppetry, the filmmaker created an ambitious project. I've read complaints from viewers about the sparse, flat backgrounds of this film. I thought, given the style they attempt to emulate, they were wonderful. The pop-up book approach to transitions was executed with grace. The color palate of the film, while a bit too dichotomous for my tastes, is sharp and functional as it represents the two opposing forces (oppression and rebellion) and opposing styles of the main characters (old west and samurai).

While the inconsistent nods to classic American musical cinema puts some people off, I found it entertaining. I don't feel it was used in sufficient amounts though. It needed to be played up more, like Kung Fu Hustle, or down into a subtle nuance of Killer #2's fighting style. As it stands, it feels uneven, most likely due to its uneven application throught the film. It is either in your face or not there at all.

I enjoyed the acting, simplistic as it was. I don't believe that Josh Hartnett's approach to the cowboy needed a dynamic drama to him, nor did Ron Perlman's Woodcutter. I will say, however, that Woodcutter had my favorite scene in the film when he philosophizes about the need for a costume with Killer #2. The only character I felt was superfluous to the film was Demi Moore's whore, whose connection to the other characters felt forced in an effort to make THEM, not HER, feel like a more complete character.

My biggest complaint about this movie is the pacing. It starts off quickly, slows down a lot, take a long time to tell you what you really need to know, then speeds up again at the very end. In the middle, there are moments where it feels like it is moving, but it isn't. I spent more time than I like glaring at my BD-player's counter and wondering why it wasn't further along in the film. This pacing problem needed to be solved in two ways, streamlining the script and editing the film.

Overall, the film doesn't come across as amateurish or mundane, but neither does it approach the sublime art/action film many of us had hoped it would be. The filmmaker, Guy Moshe, is new to the game and his status as neophyte is obvious. However, one could also see his shortcomings as momentary setbacks in what could be a great career. After all, how many novice filmmakers come up with an idea this ambitious or execute it with such style?

I recommend this film to anyone who loves experimentation in filmmaking. This experiment is not a total failure, nor is it a complete success. Some people will like it more than others. It certainly seems to polarize reviewers on other websites. This is definitely a film that I would say you need to see on your own, regardless of your tastes. There are a ton of reviews but don't let them dictate your decision to view this film. Make your own judgement.",1346284800,4,3376,4.703891708967851
4673156,3,B005F96URI,"In a violent, dystopic, gun-free world two strangers arrive in a crime-ridden city looking for revenge. One is a nameless drifter, the strong, silent type who wields his fists like bullets. The other is a young samurai, concerned with honor above all. With the help of an insurgent bartender the two strangers join forces to take down a shadowy crime lord and his group of 9 deadly killers.

As you can probably tell by the description, this movie holds to every western/samurai/revenge flick clich you can think of, but it does it with style.

The heavily stylized visuals and sound effects are the stars of this film. The movie opens up with a Japanese puppet show (bunraku) which sets up the world and gives background for the lack of guns. The movie, which was filmed entirely on a sound stage, is full of elaborate sets that look like they came straight out of a pop-up book. The visual style is quite gorgeous. The fight scenes (of which there are many) are choreographed almost like a dance. Every move is planned and graceful. This especially applies to Kevin McKidd's Killer #2 who looks like a cross between Alex DeLarge and Gene Kelly.

The cinematography provides even more visual flare. Rather than cut from one location to another, the camera races over the landscape, the city being constructed along the way as it arrives at its destination. I really enjoyed this technique, which reminded me of Moulin Rouge's camera trekking through the streets of Paris. One scene that particularly stood out for me was The Drifter infiltrating a multi-level prison. He travels from level to level, knocking out guards as he goes in one continuous tracking shot that was reminiscent of an old Donkey Kong game. I do love a good long tracking shot.

The story plays out in a very predictable way. There are no surprises or shocking twists, this is a by-the-book revenge tale.

The acting in the movie is solid. Josh Hartnett seems born to play these mysterious stranger roles - he's got the look and the voice and I even believed all his fight scenes. Japanese superstar Gackt played his samurai role well. Woody Harrelson was right at home playing a bartender and provided most of the movie's laughs. Ron Perlman has the size and intimidation factor down pat. Kevin McKidd had the most interesting role to work with and performed admirably.

The weakest part of the movie was Demi Moore's character, Alexandra, the crime lord's woman. It wasn't the acting, that was fine, but the character itself was poorly thought out and completely superfluous. She  attempts to bring some emotional depth to a couple of the male characters but it really doesn't work. She's brought in, given a couple scenes then disappears without any resolution to the plot-lines she introduced. This attempt at story-telling adds nothing and actually gets in the way of the movie. The whole character could have (and should have) been cut out. This would have had the added benefit of cutting the film's slightly bloated running time (118 minutes) down to something more reasonable.

Your enjoyment of Bunraku will depend on your expectations. If you're expecting fresh story-telling and well developed characters you will be sorely disappointed. I appreciate it for what it is: a good old-fashioned beat'em up with an exciting new visual style. What the movie lacks in depth it more than makes up for in entertainment value.",1345852800,,3400,4.880415944540728
4673157,3,B005F96URI,"This is set somewhen in a dystopian future. In a world where guns have been outlawed, a mysterious cowboy (Josh Hartnett) with unknown purpose drifts into a lawless town. In an era that claims the sword as the weapon of choice, the samurai Yoshi (Gackt) is tasked with an errand of honor and arrives at that same godforsaken place. Both parties end up at the Horseless Horseman Saloon where the canny Bartender (Woody Harrelson) plies his trade, dispensing equal doses of whiskey and advice. The samurai Yoshi and Hartnett's stranger - who packs no heat and makes do with his lightning-quick fists - have beef with the town's badass gang lord Nicola the Woodcutter (Ron Perlman).

Nicola the Woodcutter commands a horde of red-shirted henchmen, as well as a cadre of elite bodyguards and enforcers designated as Killers #2 thru #10, with these death dealers always vying against each other to rise up in numerical rank. Nicola is, of course, Killer #1. Nicola is so arrogant he allows the townspeople constant opportunity to challenge his proxy in death duels for town supremacy. His proxy, the anonymous Killer #2 (Kevin McKidd), may look like a dandy, but he regularly takes on twenty opponents at the same time and effortlessly carves them up. Killer #2, elegant and graceful, comes off like a sadistic John Steed or - and how's this imagery? - a murderous Fred Astaire.

1972's RED SUN, which featured Charles Bronson and Toshir Mifune, did it already and probably did it better, the mashing up of the samurai film and the spaghetti western. But BUNRAKU also introduces a sci-fi element, although that's more relegated to the backdrop, there just to establish the premise.

Bunraku, defined, is a form of traditional Japanese puppet theatre. Accordingly, whereas RED SUN had down-to-earth grit, this film espouses a deliberately staged and artificial look, borrowing some from the highly stylized sensibility of SIN CITY, or as the Bartender is won't to label SIN CITY's genre: ""pop up funnies."" It is technically superb and visually tremendous, but don't be surprised should you sense an emptiness in the narrative. None of the characters felt real. The cowboy stranger gets the archetypal treatment but isn't given much depth or dimension. The cowboy specializes in launching mighty haymakers and the samurai seeks the perfection of jin, the toughest of the Bushido codes to master - and those seem to count heavily as the primary character notes. Near the end, though, the samurai does undergo a fairly fundamental shift in his warrior's credo; it's the only way he could've bested his opponent. The exaggerated dialogue doesn't help things. But I did like Faith No More's frontman Mike Patton's voiceover narration. Patton, leisurely and pseudo-philosophical in his musings, sets the tone early on.

I also think it's cool that Josh Hartnett visually channels Kurt Russell circa TOMBSTONE. It lends him a harder, more weathered look.

Demi Moore is here, playing Ron Perlman's reluctant lady, but she's not the reason to see this bizarre hybrid film. Instead, see BUNRAKU for the colorful visuals, the heightened sensibility, those off-kilter beats, and the boffo, over-the-top action scenes. The samurai Yoshi also has a cousin who is really cute, even if when she tries to use martial arts, she just ends up looking silly.

And, as always, it's never good to be a Red Shirt.

3.5 out of 5 stars for BUNRAKU.

4673158,1,B005F96URI,"This movie has earned a place of honor in my lists of movies.  It did to me what no other movie has done in over 20 years:  it made me not finish it.  I have seen plenty of bad movies (Avatar, Order, Practical Magic) but with those I was at least able to sit through them in their entirety (I think I deserve an award for sitting through ""Avatar"", but that's just me).  This one I couldn't.

Set in a post-apocalyptic world where guns are banned, Drifter (is that his name or were the writers just unable to think of one?) and non-violent samurai Yoshi (yeah, wrap your head around that one, but don't worry, his vow lasts less than 5 minutes) show up in a town run by a crime boss named Nicola (Ron Perlman, looking like he wandered in from one of those Geico caveman commercials), but for what reason I don't know.  As far as I can tell, Drifter is just looking for a game of cards (which is banned) and Yoshi is on a mission from his father to get...something.

The supporting cast is just as boring.  There's also Woody Harrelson as The Bartender (an odd name, ""The""; did his parents hate him or were they just lazy?), the one local willing to help them, although it's in the form of cryptic riddles and pop-up books.  There's a girl involved as well, Nicola's beautiful but unwilling girlfriend (she joined him to save her true love's life; I have an idea who the true love is, but I didn't stick around to find out. I wonder if they get back together?).  Enough, enough, ENOUGH ALREADY!  I'M CALLING THE CLICH POLICE!

I'm wondering if the writers purposely set out to throw every action movie clich they could think of into this and then really REALLY hoped their paper-maiche sets would somehow distract us.  Would it have killed them to give us characters who weren't as thin as the paper they used for their sets?  Give me something, ANYTHING to make me care about any of the people in this, is that too much to ask?  For the makers of this film, it clearly was.",1340668800,3,1972,4.3497267759562845

4673160,2,B005F96URI,"Guy Moshe's ""Bunraku"" is a genre-bending amalgamation of Western movie and graphic novel (and a bit of bunraku, Japanese traditional puppet theater). The film's visuals are highly stylized with bright colors and dark shadows all over, but the film lacks story to tell and action to show. This is a typical case of ""style over substance,"" which in itself is not a bad thing, but with the running time that exceeds two hours, production design alone is not enough to keep us interested in the film's thin story.

The concept is intriguing. In a post-apocalyptic dystopian city where no guns are allowed, Josh Hartnett's ""Drifter"" meets a samurai ""Yoshi"" played by Japanese pop culture icon Gackt at the saloon run by the Bartender (Woody Harrelson). After their initial confrontation, the two strangers learn that what they want is ultimately the same.

However, ""Bunraku"" takes too much time before letting us know where it is going. There are so many fight scenes, but with choreography not so original, the film's action, which should have been one of the film's assets, soon starts to get repetitious and tiresome. Most characters are forgettable (Ron Perlman is wasted; Demi Moore's role is pointless) and acting passable at best. The only exception is ""Killer No. 2"" played by Kevin McKidd. He is not boring.

Watching ""Bunraku"" is after all watching its designs. And like ""Dick Tracy"" made about 20 years ago, it shows that production design is something that is necessary but not sufficient for filmmaking.",1331683200,2,1512,5.01593625498008
4673161,3,B005F96URI,"Started out rather disappointing, as it was beginning to look like a musical and rather hokey, but I stuck with it and the story developed and the singing and dancing around stopped, so I could take it a little more seriously.

The visuals were stunning, and the fight scenes were very great. I think you have to be in a mood for this type of movie, though.

I would say it has the feel of sin city if I were to compare it to anything else... but more cartoonish, and silly.",1330646400,2,474,4.197802197802198

This is a very interesting martial arts type movie involving a mixed nationality of characters, and is filmed much like as if it were a play.  There are also some periodic elements in this movie that would likely appease gamers, comic book lovers, and western lovers as well.  I found this to be an all around entertaining movie, and I would say it's definitely worth a watch, if not a purchase.  I for one will be picking this up on Blu-Ray at some point.",1329609600,,557,4.54
4673163,3,B005F96URI,"Can style triumph over substance?  Well...no, it can't.  But it can make a jolly good effort, as BUNRAKU goes to show.  The film follows a nameless drifter (Josh Hartnett) and Yoshi (Gackt) as they seek to dethrone the tyrant Nicola (Ron Perlman), who oversees a post-apocalyptic town with barely-constrained fury.  Their story is told by our Narrator, singer Mike Patton doing his best David Carradine. And a simple story it is: Yoshi seeks honor, the drifter's motives remained unknown until the end, and on the way they find out that they are stronger together, and that they are fighting for a cause other than their own.  Story doesn't matter here: what's important to writer/director Guy Moshe is style, the fight scenes arranged like dance numbers, the use of color and imagery and music and shadow.  Moshe has truly created a film to be SEEN, as obvious as that may sound.

The problem is, it's not quite a successful experiment.  Sure, the film is enjoyable, edgy, and not quite like anything else you've seen.  But it's still a bit too derivative of its influences.  Plus, the two leads are unfortunately miscast: Hartnett isn't emotive enough, and Gackt is too much so.  Oddly, both actors truly come alive in the fight sequences: they bring a level of physicality to their roles that is enrapturing.  Watching them fight remains a highlight of the film, especially their scene against each other, where they learn their respective strengths and weaknesses.  (Kudos to Hartnett, for actually coming off as a tough guy...when he doesn't have to speak, at least.)

The supporting cast is rounded out well (with the exception of Demi Moore, who is wasted here; her role is unnecessary to the plot, and she knows it).  Ron Perlman gives one of his better performances lately; he is utterly intimidating in what little screen time he has.  Woody Harrelson provides some comic relief; he doesn't even bother acting, really--this is probably one of his worst performances of late--but he knows how to twist his face at the right moment.  He's along for the indie cred, but at least he's honest about it (and hilarious).  The true standout of the film, cast-wise, is Kevin McKidd as Killer No. 2, Nicola's chief lieutenant.  He's suave and deadly, with just enough rugged Scottish fury to make him come off as truly unstable, even when he's dispassionately staving off an entire army single-handedly.  It's rare that you find a villain so deliciously charming.

Ultimately, BUNRAKU is a film for people interested in artsy action films; it's not as successful as, say, KUNG FU HUSTLE, but it gets credit for effort, and it's certainly interesting to watch.  Few films has such an interesting premise, or so such promise; unfortunately, that means its failure is all the more noticeable, but with a film such as this, you take the good with the bad, and just have a good time.",1328227200,,2878,4.86652977412731

4673165,5,B005F96URI,"I had never heard anything about this when I watched it. I just saw it had Woody Harrelson and Ron Pearlman in it and figured I'd give it a shot. From the first 10 seconds I could tell this was my kind of movie. It starts off very strange with a kind of dark humor intro that sets the tone for the whole movie. The movie is set up more like a Broadway play than a Hollywood action flick, but unlike some other movies I've seen like that, this one works very well. Most of the acting in this is phenomenal, and it maintains it's humor through the tongue-in-cheek performances of the stars. Josh Hartnett does an awesome job of carrying the film as the lead, and Woody Harrelson is fantastic as always. Despite never having heard of it, I was surprised by how awesome this movie really was. I don't know anything about how it was released, but this should have been a major blockbuster. It reminded me of Sin City but with more heart and structure. It takes a combination of many genre's of film and adds that to a combination of many ages-old stories of revenge, redemption, courage, etc. and combines them all beautifully. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of movies that do not adhere to the norm, or anyone who is a fan of Woody Harrelson, as he can seem to do no wrong lately.",1327536000,,1298,4.302040816326531
4673166,4,B005F96URI,"I originally got this just because GACKT was in it. But really, all the leading roles are an amazing cast. Who'd waste time arguing that each of these actors haven't been great?! Well, anyone can say what they want, I guess. But truth be told, they made a quite enjoyable film out of what might have been less that that for me.
Sorry. I'm just not into the vengeance genre. (And this is obviously not the biggest budget film). But I thoroughly enjoyed the fantasy aspect about it. Very comic-book like. Very colorful. The fight scenes are obviously rehearsed and at times looks more like dancing or play fighting. For me, it's reminiscent of the Adam West Batman series hinted with bits of Sin City or something. But maybe that's just my oddball comparison.
Many of the costumes seem to be a spin off of Dick Tracy meets The Wiz. Not a bad thing. Just makes it a little more fantasy-like.
As for GACKT, Josh and Woody, they were without question the best actors in this film. Ultimately, they are the reason I keep watching again and again. They keep it interesting and will help to draw you in to the story a bit. At least, it's their characters that the the story follows most.
Even in the end, the characters backgrounds are still somewhat vague. It could be that it leaves it open for individual interpretation. But really, it's slightly unsettling to not have a more definite idea about the history of each character. As for Josh's character, I think it remains that his name is never even announced (hence, the 'nameless drifter'). Maybe it's supposed to add/keep the mystery?
The story itself is pretty good. At least, there IS a plot and a somewhat grand finale. Sometimes its a bit cheesy, repetitious or has way too much dialogue. (just like my review? haha) Not really gory, but there's bloody scenes that make me go 'dang!'
Overall, nice action film for movie night in with popcorn.",1327363200,,1894,4.623145400593472

Set in a near but not futuristic future where weapons are outlawed and the races mix freely in style and culture, this movie follows the path of two men in their quest for vengeance, guided by a third man who knows better, and those whom they confront, a list of killers, each with his own style.  Mixing both live action and animation, the movie mashes up everything in every aspect of the film.  Filming uses multiple styles; sometimes the camera moves, sometimes it stays the same; some scenes are shot from above, some from below, some in perspective.  The storytelling involves flashbacks, parallel story-lines, and occasional diversions as comedy, suspense, drama and great dialogue are mixed together.  Overall, a great film.",1326585600,,862,5.0
4673169,4,B005F96URI,"Don't know where it came from. Don't remember a theatrical release. But this is so far out of left field I wonder how the cast was assembled and how it ever got the green light.

""Bunraku"" is a real wild ride. Take a little ""Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"", throw in a bit of ""Caligari"" and a sprinkling of ""Sin City"" and you're close to the look and feel of this.

Here's the scoop. It's post apocalypse. The society is rebuilt but there are no guns. All fighting is done with hand held weapons. The ""haves"" still have and the ""have nots"" still have not. It's a skewed society. Ron Perlman is Killer #1 and he has 9 other acolytes behind him. He rules this particular city. Yoshi arrives in town to retrieve a medallion take from his father after he died at the hands of a bad guy. Josh Hartnett wants to release the town from Perlman's iron grip. Turns out both men are after the same guy.

This is a very stylish movie. None of the sets is something you'd find in a ""normal"" movie. There are very few right angles and no natural lighting. Everything is very German Expressionistic. Wild color schemes and weird set designs prevail. Even the script and acting are very stylized. The music is pretty wild as is the action. It almost looks like a live graphic novel.

This is not a great movie but I have to applaud it for its sheer audacity. There are some problems here. The script is nowhere near involved enough for the 2 hour plus running time. There are also too many fight scenes. They are generally well choreographed but, after the 5th or 6th fight, it all gets a bit tired. The acting is decent. Hartnett, Perlman and Woody Harrelson all do decent jobs. Gackt, as Yoshi is good. He has a great face for the camera and wears a sense of weariness about him. Demi Moore is also good in a role that is woefully small. That being said, this should still be seen. Movies like this don't come around often so, even with its shortcomings, it deserves the viewership to insure movies like this continue to get made. If you want a wild ride, this should do you just fine.",1326326400,,2064,4.353246753246753
4673170,3,B005F96URI,"Set in a time in the future that we are told is... some time in the future; we are faced with a world where man has been so inhuman to man that all firearms are banned! They are allowed to walk around with all forms of medieval stuff though, so all violent types need not fear.

Thrown into this heady mix of a world with neither calendars nor guns come three unsuspecting heroes. One, a drifter (Josh Hartnett), two a barman (Woody Harrelson) and the third a lone young Samurai - Gackt (well there is always one isn't there). They coalesce (meet) in `Little Westworld' a place that is ruled by a ruthless tyrannical man in a large hat and cloak - Nicola (Ron Perlman). He uses his army of red besuited henchman to maintain a gang warfare rule, that includes extortion, prostitution, corrupt police and sushi!

All three have reasons to want things to end, be it honour, lost love or something more intangible like revenge. They alone must fight the nasty Ron Perlman and Killer No 2 (Kevin McKidd). What is unleashed is an homage to so many things I was a bit confused, the only thread that runs through everything is the fighting - and if that is your bag you will be far from disappointed.

This film oozes style, it starts off being like a sixties re booted `Batman' and then goes all `Sin City', and every set is framed and shot like a graphic novel work of pop art. All the cars are classics even though this is the future, from a Fiat 500 to a Bentley hearse that is doubling up as a taxi and I am sure I spotted a Simca in the mix too. There is also oodles of Japanese influences and a particular preference for red in nigh on every shot. The dialogue though intermittent is sparse and to the point, not overly polished, but still contrived enough to have more than a nod to the noir classics.  The plot unfolds quite predictably, the only shocks come from the violence, which is so stylised and choreographed that the blood comes across as not that authentic either.

That said this is a sumptuous production that cares more about style than the vehicle it uses to get the message across, and that is the only real criticism, there is humour, there is pathos, though only a veneer and there is a love interest that is left hanging, but there is a load of fighting. If you like action films with more than a leaning to the oriental then this will rock your world; if you like a more original plot then you will probably only remember this for the high production values. I did like the style but felt it lacked substance - hence my rating. There are good performances from  all concerned and director Guy Moshe should be proud of what he has created, it is the script that has let this down, but it is far from being a bad film, it just is not a great one.",1326153600,3,2764,4.336557059961315

4673172,4,B005F96URI,"It was fun to watch. The story's not that deep, no, but so what. Most movies nowadays are unoriginal. Bad guy/warlord comes to power and needs to be taken down. What's original is how they get there and the style at which it's done. Bunraku is like a Japanese manga come to life. Unlike the live action movies and series made from manga and their subsequent animes, Bunraku doesn't attempt to place the characters in the context of normal life in regular surroundings. Instead it draws you into it's world using animation, creative yet sparse sets, paralleled bright and drab colors, good lighting, and great camera angles. Oh and the occasional pop-up book character adds to the feel as well. For some reason I see Josh Hartnet's name and think 'oh this is gonna be awful' and almost always have to eat my words. I don't know what I have against him, but I need to get over it. He was good and a little sexy. As was Gackt as Yoshi, the samurai who only wanted to retrieve a medallion. Gackt was so good I forgot he was Gackt and if you know anything about him, you know he's a character unto himself. Thus, seeing Yoshi and not Gackt is no small fete. Woody Harrelson was good, but the scene stealing Kevin McKidd was better. I kept expecting McKidd's Killer #2 to have a dance scene a la Kung Fu Hustle. Killer #2 has style and rhythm to spare. I can't say enough good things. Good cast. Good production. Good movie. 4.5 stars",1325548800,,1428,4.433460076045628
4673173,5,B005F96URI,"Bunraku is awesome. I loved how all of the settings looked like pages out of a pop-up book. :) It's like the Sin City movie had a love child with the Scott Pilgrim movie.  The action was good. I was actually on the edge of my seat to find out if the main characters would live or die in the final battle. And there were certain scenes where so much was going on that I really want to watch the whole movie a second time (like tomorrow) so I can pay attention to some of the background stuff that I think I missed while I was paying attention to the foreground stuff. I know it got kind of crappy reviews, but I loved it!
  Bunraku = 5 stars, in my book.

The plot wasn't the most complex, but the acting was good and the battle scenes were cool.  If you like ""typical"" movies and only typical movies, then Bunraku is not for you.  But if you want your senses to be engaged and the creative part of your brain to be stimulated from start to finish, then you should definitely check out this movie.

Josh Hartnett, Gackt, and Woody Harrelson made for a fun trio.  And Gackt really is evolving as an actor.  I enjoyed him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moon-Child/dp/B0001WTWII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moon Child</a>, but I think that he dug deeper for this role.

Parental advisory--possible spoilers ahead (I tried not to give anything away, though):

As for sex, violence, etc...There is no nudity or sex in the movie at all.  There is a bit of dialogue that implies the duties of a concubine, but not graphically or in any real detail whatsoever.  The characters do drop several F-bombs.  There aren't any really scary or frightening scenes, at least not any that I think anyone would find frightening. Two of the main characters and several minor characters are seen smoking throughout most of the movie.  Most of the characters are seen drinking alcohol at some point.  One of the characters visits an absinthe den and is served a glass of absinthe, but is not seen drinking it; it is implied, however, that the character had been there for a while and was already somewhat intoxicated.  There is a lot of violence in the movie because there are a great many fight scenes.  However, there are no guns in the entire movie.  The characters fight using martial arts, brass knuckles, swords, axes, knives, sticks, spears, arrows, bats, etc.  There is not a whole lot of gore, though.  There are a few instances where deaths are slightly graphic.  Several characters get their throats slit, a couple get hit with an axe (one in the head), a few are impaled by swords/spears, and one character is stabbed in the eye.  The blood and gore was not over the top, but I don't think it was too mild, either...just right in my opinion.  :)

4673175,4,B005F96URI,"[Review based on the theatrical release.] This is an fascinatingly stylized film that is as much about filmmaking itself as it is about its mythological, Joseph Campbell-esque plot. I was originally interested in it because of the involvement of Japanese singer/auteur Gackt, whose staged works I greatly admire. However, when I read the mainstream reviews, I went into the theater thinking than the film would be a disaster or even worse, a ""so bad it's bad"" bore.

Nothing could be further from the truth. I found the film engaging from beginning to end, with more visual information packed into the theatrically lit and staged frames than could possibly be absorbed in a single viewing. During the showing I didn't look at my watch once and I am not easily amused.

This film deserves to advance to ""cult classic"" status and is a film that deserves to be added to future film school curricula because of its success in using many of the devices of filmmaking and theater to create a visually consistent, entirely artificial world. I usually rent instead of buying, but this film is worth more than one watch, just to absorb more of the kaleidoscopic visuals.

If you love the ""production design"" aspect of filmmaking, this is a five-star movie. If you mostly care about story and a novel plotline, then call it 2  stars because there is little new in the plot. If you like a mythological story that is told in a way you have never seen before, then Bunraku is a solid four stars.",1322438400,7,1482,4.710424710424711

He starred alongside another popular japanese singer (Hyde) in Moon Child, and has been acting in a television series in japan.

Thanks to that I was already excited about this movie. It didn't disappoint me. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this movie is very much my style. Interesting story, characters, and some good actors help make this movie awesome. It mixes several different things together giving it an interesting feel. The pop-up like animation scenes are well done and one of my favorite things about the movie. Of course, I love the fighting as well.

(Spaghetti western & samurai mix) fun fact: the old Spaghetti westerns were actually re-adaptations of Japanese samurai shows. Remade as westerns to the T. So much so that the people looked alike and the lines were the exact same.

One day a drifter comes to town...known as ""The Drifter."" He looks like Leonardo DiCaprio and wants to get into a high stakes card game. The sets has that surreal CG look that we originally saw in ""Dick Tracy."" The scenes are all done on a stage.

In a subplot, another stranger named Yoshi (Gackt Camui) comes to town. He is looking to avenge his father by taking back a golden dragon talisman. Both men have the ability to fight multiple trained fighters at one time without breaking a sweat. They bump heads at the Horseless Horseman and decide to join forces against Nicola and his red suit fighters as a cowboy without a gun and samurai without a sword.

The film is something Quinton Tarantino might have done growing up watching ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World."" It has cartoon segments, numbers dropping down by people, extreme amount of fighting, and quirky humor. Woody Harrelson provides us with philosophy and pop-up books. If you like weird action films and Scott Pilgrim type of movie, this one will blow you away. The dialouge is filled with symbolism, metaphors, and double entendres.

Your initial reaction is like finding an exotic food in a five star restaurant that you're suspicious and wary of trying; because of it's name, where it comes from and the way it looks.

Viewing Guide:
The movie is a collage of the following: pop art (Warhol style); origami; Expressionistic art; stage musical; Italian western spaghetti meets Japanese samurai similar to the TV series ""Zatoichi"" - the blind amna, bakuto, warrior; high end graphic comic books of the Japanese manga style. The Art Deco backgrounds contribute a flat contrast to the vibrantly colorful foreground characters; a lot like Asian stage puppetry. There seems to be stylistic elements from movies such as Kill Bill and ""Dark City"" with it's background buildings that grow in two dimensional form as you watch.

Very novel use of props such as the get-away car that would make a MINI-Cooper look like a limousine and projectors that were actually old, turn of the century, carbon arc magic lanterns. The dialogue contains burlesque, parody, bombast, conceit phrasing such as: ""An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth will forever make better grammatical balance than turning the other cheek.""

Storyline is fairly typical good vs. evil martial arts; cinematography, CGI, set design, directing were great (quite novel/creative); acting was good for all except that Moore was just a forgettable neutral figure piece and Harrelson was miscast, just reading a few lines in his usual way while offering nothing magical in his critical moderating role - he just didn't seem to fit.",1320969600,2,1666,4.942857142857143
