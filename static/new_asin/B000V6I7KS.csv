The Songs are very deep and poetic. Enrique's songs are quite sad (Agarrate a mi Maria).His younger brother Alvaro Urquijo, took over after his death in 1999 (he was 39 years old). It is priced at $21.00 (a little steep). It is acoustic, guitars, piano,bass, drums, accompanied by an orchestra string section. VERY WELL DONE.It is in spanish the band being  from Madrid.  Their lead guitarist,Ramon Arroyo is outstanding and their sound is incredible. Too bad this band's music is not easelly available to the large USA hispanic market and Central and South American markets which are huge. They formed in the 80s and in 2010 celebrated their 30th anniversary. Look for them. They are GOOD.",1286150400,,848,4.964788732394366
