2783525,4,B000NVI2C4,"Okay. First, I'm a big fan of Dr. Who. Almost a ""fanboy."" And Tom Baker is my favorite actor in the role, including the two ""new"" Doctors (who are both excellent as well). So you'd think I'd give Tom Baker's debut episode five stars.

Alas, no. Why? Because this ""Pertwee-style"" episode isn't a particularly good Pertwee episode, let alone one of the Baker greats. It is marred by its obvious ""homage"" (you might say ""rip-off"") of King Kong, worse-than-usual special effects (and I find the cheesy all-video effects of ""classic"" Who charming for the most part), and cartoon characterizations by the Brigadier (Nicholas Courtney, who is usually much better than this), Prof. Kettlewell (Edward Burnham), and an OTT performance by Patricia Maynard as Hilda Winters, head both of the think-tank and of the neo-fascist SRS.

The SRS (Scientific Reform Society) is a potentially crackerjack idea -- a bunch of scientists who decide that they know better how the world should be run and they use their technological prowess to achieve it. But idea is wasted in making them just your typical power-mad bunch (""Your own clothing, for example, do you think it is entirely suitable?""). The idea of a bunch of misguided scientists seeking a rational utopia is a good one, but these guys are just another bunch of cartoon villains.

Plus the robot design, while not much sillier than any other Doctor Who monster, is ruined for me by the 1/4 inch tubes that connect his huge hands to his huge arms. A child could snap them!

Now, after this, you might be wondering why I give it four stars instead of one! First, all ""classic"" Who has a basic cheapness and silliness that comes from the show's incredibly low budget. The show is meant as a children's show, but the writing and acting usually make it stand up well to much more ""adult"" shows. Part of my praise comes from this ""charity"" the show automatically gets. The rest comes from being Tom Baker's debut story. Even though the plot is weak and the characters less interesting than most Who scripts, there is some great dialogue, especially between the Doctor and both the Brigadier and Harry Sullivan.

The next three years of Who are probably the best the show ever had and that is part of why this is four, not five stars -- the best is just around the corner...",1179878400,16,2307,4.7288557213930345

It's was this four-part adventure by Terrance Dicks that would marked the beginning of the Tom Baker Era.

This tale is a bit clunky and is definetly a weird call back to the themes represented in King Kong although here ""kong"" or the ""robot"" speaks to the audience. If you enjoy King Kong this tale is for you but regardless it's not bad. As I said not the worst regeneration story although it's definitely not THE best",1423267200,,436,4.395061728395062
2783548,4,B000NVI2C4,"This story arc of Doctor Who remains one of my favorites for a fairly simple reason: it was the first time I had ever seen the show. I must have been eight or nine when Oregon Public Broadcasting started broadcasting Doctor Who, starting with the Tom Baker episodes. Instead of showing them serially, as they were shown in Britain, OPB played an entire arc at one time - pretty much the same experience as watching this on DVD after all these years.

While this isn't the best example of a Doctor Who story arc (the following story, ""The Ark in Space"",  is fantastic), it has a lot of great moments and characters. Whether it is the truly incredible head of mad-scientist-hair on Edward Burnham (""Professor Kettlewell') or the absolutely over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek performance by Patricia Maynard (""Miss Winters"") this arc has a lot of fun elements that makes it very re-watchable.
Being the first appearance of Tom Baker as the Doctor, the writers and producers hadn't totally fleshed out his character and he comes off more delightfully manic than he does later in the series. From his series of costume changes (Viking, harlequin,etc.) as he tries to determine his new look to his frenzied jogging and karate chopping, you can tell that all involved wanted to make sure that this was a break from the past. However, at the same time, there are some fun nods to former times as the Doctor tools around in the vintage yellow car that the Jon Pertwee version used for much of his run in the title role.

As is the case with many adventures, this one is filled with some silly special effects and laugh-out-loud moments (such as the robot tripping over himself). Ultimately, though, the strength of this episode is in the characters, the  performances by the guest stars, and how Tom Baker truly becomes the best Doctor ever in such a short period of time.",1423267200,,1858,4.743034055727554

2783560,4,B000NVI2C4,"This serial's big purpose was to introduce the fourth Doctor and transition into his own stories. For the most part, this serial succeeds admirably on both counts. Tom Baker brings a ton of quirkiness to the role, particularly in Episode 1 with his tying up of Harry Sullivan and how he chooses his iconic outfit. There's plenty of laughs in the first episode. However, the Doctor was equally capable of getting serious as he did in Episode 3 when Warrant Officer Benton allowed Sarah Jane to do something that put her in very serious risk.

The plot was decent with a robot forced to kill contrary to programming, and I have to give the story points for a clever twist in Episode 3 that I didn't see coming. Episode 4 had some silly contrived stuff such as the villains not having bothered to find out how much food they had to survive a nuclear holocaust and how the robot grew to giant size at the end.

Still, the flaws couldn't ruin a very solid beginning for the fourth doctor and an always enjoyable performance by Elizabeth Sladen.",1402444800,,1039,4.550802139037433

When I started watching DrWho Tom Baker was my Doctor.  At first I did not like the 3rd doctor (Jon Pertwee) however now he is one of the old time doctor who that I do like to watch. Each and every episode that Tom Baker has played in as the Doctor I have enjoyed.  And was very happy to see that Tom Baker played a part in the new series of DrWho as well.

Tom is such a good actor.

Tom Baker will always be #1 for me even though I have other doctors that I enjoy as well.  All of the doctors in the new series I have enjoyed watching so far.  However if they ever make DrWho regenerate into a woman the show will be over for me.  You cannot change sex by regenerating you just become younger again.

2783572,5,B000NVI2C4,"""Robot"" does have some of the worst special effects imaginable, even by Dr. Who standards.  That was the conclusion I reached after having viewed this installment in the very late 70s on Public Television in the near aftermath of having seen the visually superiors ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" at the movie theater.  You know, kind of akin to going to a Barry Manilow concert where the opening acts are The Ramones and The Clash.  However, I lived in a rural setting where cable television was not available (it wasn't until the 1990s that rural cable came into existence in my neck of the woods), and so I basically had the choice, after school, of the four TV affiliates of:  ABC, NBC, CBS, and PBS.  Since the three major networks invariably had some lame talk show going on (cough - Donahue - cough), a stupid ""After School Special"" (check out the episode featuring the Love Boat guy where he is trying to stop his kid from ""turning punk"", if ""punk"" meant combing one's hair into the air ala Robert Smith), or some game show that would bore even a great grandmother.  The very fact that something was on the air that interested me in the slightest was a miracle, and so began my fascination with Dr. Who.  This was the very first episode of Dr. Who I ever saw (the Kansas PBS affiliate, KWCH, played the BBC series literally in a row years after the fact); only appropriate since it was also Tom Baker's first appearance as the Doctor.  I wasn't cultured until this point, but after initially smirking at the laughter-inducing special effects in ""Robot"" (who himself looked like some beer bellied chap in tin foil leggings walking like a duck), I began to recognize the brilliance in the writing, acting, dialogue, and comedy.  By the third episode of ""Robot,"" I was hooked.  At the time, I didn't even know Dr. Who was a series; I thought it was some mini-series that PBS decided to air instead of their normal ""Electric Company"" (which, I will say, was an excellent children's show) fare.  But low and behold, after ""Robot"" ended, ""The Ark in Space"" continued, and I realized that this was a full fledged tv series, much to my excitement.  So, to make a long story short (though that ship has already sailed), this installment moved me.  ""Robot"" will always be special to me.  Watching this DVD brought back so many memories for me.  But also, the special features make this DVD one that you cannot pass up:  A documentary on Tom Baker taking over the role of Dr. Who, A mini-documentary on the origination of the opening show's sequence during the Baker years (the never ending tunnel with that great music), and the producer/actor/actress commentary which features Tom Baker himself.

2783581,5,B000NVI2C4,"While The Eleventh Hour is a close bloody second, for my money ROBOT (Yeah I like all caps for this title) is hands down the best Post-Regeneration episode. It effectively starts the New Doctor running, and presents him with all the defining traits that tell the audience what we will inevitably come to love about him. What is equally astonishing about ROBOT is that the story is remarkably involving and (model tanks aside) the execution of this story is consistently thrilling. Whether it be the poignantly written title character and his beautifully tragic bond with Sarah Jane (always perfect Elisabeth Sladen) or the alluringly devious villainess Miss Winters who is hell bent to create an intellectually fascist societyusing the unfortunate ROBOT as a pawn. This story also effectively serves as a fantastic bridge from the Pertwee era into the Baker era by involving UNIT, and the reliably stalwart Brigadier. You think it's going to be the same old adventures until the final few minutes when you realize that this new Doctor is not going to be tied down by red tape.

While Baker's predecessors all did marvellous jobs in putting their own stamp on the character, Baker really was the first one to give the character such a significant change in personality that it would forever put a stamp on every other actor to follow. While Baker's successors have done wonderful things with The Doctor's alien eccentricity, Baker really was the one to pioneer the trait in the character. The Doctor's back and forth with Harry (A wonderful old-fashioned companion played by the late, great Ian Marter) is a scene of electrifying spontaneity, and never loses anything from either time or repitition. It single-handedly declared to the audience, that major changes were afoot.

While later Doctors fared better than others in establishing themselves in the role, ROBOT was truly an force of nature that I'm sure Who fans were not expecting when it originally aired, and it never stops being enjoyable to this very day.",1351814400,,2016,5.014925373134329

ROBOT
Story # 75
Season 12's First Story
Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker Era, First Season 1974
Sixth Classic Sarah Jane Smith Story

OVERALL RATING 7/10
While it may not be a masterpiece story such as PYRAMIDS OF MARS or GENESIS OF THE DALEKS, ROBOT rates right at the the top of WHO stories with heart, as it is one of the most charming WHO stories.  It is fun, fast-paced colorful and unique, and while it is aimed more at children than normal for the Letts-Dicks-Holmes production era, ROBOT does not disappoint the adult audience.  ROBOT introduces the Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker, and is the beginning of one of the finest TARDIS teams in WHO history: Sarah Jane, Harry Sullivan and the Fourth Doctor.  ROBOT is the final WHO story produced by Barry Letts, and is the penultimate story of the UNIT team that had existed since the Second Doctor time of Patrick Troughton. A LOT going on for such a simple story that so charms the viewer.

Essential viewing for SARAH JANE ADVENTURES fans, and veteran Whovians as well.  Probably not the best story to introduce an unfamiliar person to WHO as the TARDIS is sidelined for the entire story.  The uniqueness of ROBOT along with its interesting, fast paced story will charm the viewer into overlooking its minor glitches.

STORY & SCRIPT 10/10
Excellent script and story by Terrance Dicks. ROBOT is a very unique Fourth Doctor story, in that it balances the excitment of the new, eccentric, larger-than-life Fourth Doctor with the comfortable familiar feel of a UNIT family tale from the Third Doctor's time.  The unique circumstances surrounding ROBOT give the story a wonderful, genuine charm. While ROBOT has its flaws, and is far from perfect as detailed below, the story is perfectly charming!  ROBOT is a WHO story in a class by itself in that regard.

ACTING 10/10
Superb across the board.  Elisabeth Sladen again absolutely glows as Sarah Jane, and she is the anchor of ROBOT, providing a solid reliable foundation that aids Tom Baker in quickly finding his feet.  Tom Baker is amazing in that he IS the Fourth Doctor from first screen appearance, and it is immediately apparent that the program will never be the same again, because THE Doctor has arrived. In ROBOT Part 2, during the questioning of Professor Kettlewell by Sarah, the Doctor and Brig, carefully watch the eye contact and reaction between Elisabeth Sladen and Tom Baker to see the beginning magic of the Sladen/Baker pairing.  Ian Marter's ""Lt. Harry Sullivan"" also grabs the viewer from scene one, with Harry and the Doctor providing some of the funniest moments ever in Doctor Who. When Sarah, Harry and the Fourth Doctor all enter the TARDIS at the end of ROBOT, one cannot help but feel that this will be THE Doctor Who TARDIS team.

In the guest cast, everyone shines. Patricia Maynard, in an unusually strong female role as ""Miss Winters"", is a superb villain, and ROBOT would not have been half the story it was without her.  Alec Linsted, in a great performance, genuinely creeps up the screen as the snide, oily, subserviant Arnold Jellicoe, assistant to Miss Winters. Edward Burnham brings absolute conviction and believability to the role of brilliant-but-eccentric, wild-haired Professor Kettlewell. Michael Kilgarriff, hidden under the excellent robot costume, incredibly manages to get across an emotional attachment to Sarah Jane, that is believable, even coming from a man-made machine.

The UNIT regulars, the Brigadier and newly promoted Warrent Officer Benton, (Nicholas Courtney and John Levene) shine in providing ROBOT with the familiar, comfortable Third Doctor feel that gives this story so much of its unique charm, and both give fine performances. ROBOT is a good story for UNIT, and the organization overall looks better and more professional in this story, compared to some of the earlier UNIT stories, even if the action is a bit more juvenile than normal for a story of this era.

PRODUCTION QUALITY 8/10
Excellent production quality overall, as was normal for the Barry Letts team. The entirely-shot-on-video story is as sharp, clear and colorful as if it were filmed only last week. Christopher Barry's direction is excellent, creative and even inspired.  The rope-skipping scene and the Fourth Doctor's costume-decision scene were all ideas of Director Barry's, for example, and were not in the script!

It is noticeable in ROBOT production that the story is aimed more at the younger members of the WHO audience than had been normal in the Jon Pertwee Third Doctor era.  This is most obvious in the action scenes involving UNIT.  Although there is much firing and other weapons action, it is bloodless and seems more game-like and not-so-real, and the stunt-work more aimed at a children's audience than an adult one.

So, even though this is one of the original UNIT team's better stories, ROBOT does keep UNIT activity aimed at a younger age group.  While the targeting of a story toward the younger audience would normally pull down production quality a bit, in the case of ROBOT, it is actually a major part of what gives the story its unique charm, making ROBOT a story in a class all by itself.

SPECIAL EFFECTS 6/10
The CSO-aided special effects are actually VERY good overall and hold up fairly well in this modern CGI age.  There are CSO glitches as the Robot grows enormous in size, and the ""toy doll"" Sarah Jane used in the ""King Kong"" scene DOES NOT look good at all, even for the time.

Also, the armoured vehicle special effect, using a toy tank, is very obvious.  Luckily the sharp, colorful video is well synchronized to the CSO, and that helps to keep the special effects at least a bit above average, even with the three glaring problems mentioned.

STORY IMPORTANCE 10/10
ROBOT is:
(A)The first WHO story to be shot entirely on video for both studio and location scenes;
(B)the first story of Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor;
(C)the first appearance and story of Ian Marter's ""Lt Harry Sullivan"";
(D)the last WHO story produced by Barry Letts.
(E)the next-to-last appearance of the UNIT team of Brig, Benton and company that had existed since Patrick Troughton's Second Doctor era.
(F)the first ""Sarah, Harry and Fourth Doctor"" story in a 6-story arc; a very special story arc, as three of these stories are in the top 28 WHO stories of all time as tabulated in the Doctor Who Magazine # 413 ""Mighty 200"" list.

ROBOT clearly, is a story extremely important and significant in Doctor Who history.

DVD EXTRAS 9/10
Extras are excellent as usual for Classic WHO DVD releases.  The documentary ARE FRIENDS ELECTRIC? is comprehensive, informative and entertaining, and it is particularly fascinating to hear Terrance Dicks describe how he picked up on Tom Baker's eccentric character, and wrote it into ROBOT!

The unmoderated commentary by Barry Letts, Terrance Dicks, Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen is superb and an absolute joy to listen to as the four of them work so well together. Both it and the excellent onscreen text commentary by Richard Molesworth are much too good to miss.

2783584,4,B000NVI2C4,"Robot is a regenereation story.  Tom Baker is the iconic Doctor, arguely the best and most well known Doctor.  Added to this is the presence of the late Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane and Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Leftwich-Stewart, the Doctor eases into what is probably the most well written and executed era in the series.  Gone are the gadjets and James Bond like persona of the Third Doctor played by the late Jon Pertwee, Baker's Doctor is playful at times and very tough at others.  Baker would go on to play the Doctor for seven years, twice as long as any of the previous actors in the role and those since he left the part.  In a sense, the series declined ever so gradually after Baker's departure from the role until its end in the late 1980's  Robot is a fun story in the King Kong mode and when it ends, the Doctor, Sarah Jane and Harry are off on further adventures in time and space.

2783585,4,B000NVI2C4,"The only DOCTOR WHO stories I remember vividly seeing as a child were the ones that had Tom Baker.  At the time I didn't know who he was or really anything about DOCTOR WHO. Years later I caught an episode of DOCTOR WHO on PBS and it had a completely different Doctor. It wasn't the same show and I never watched another episode of DOCTOR WHO until the new series began broadcasting on the Sci-Fi Channel.

I recently began catching up on old DOCTOR WHO episodes and decided to go back and watch the first story where Tom Baker appeared as the Doctor.  That episode is ""Robot"".

""Robot"" begins where the previous episode ended.  The Third Doctor has been ""mortally injured"" and is regenerating into his newest form.  That form turns out to be a much younger, jubilant, and whimsical Doctor in the form of Tom Baker.  The Brigadier (Nicholas Courtney) has medical doctor Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter) perform some basic tests and observations to make sure everything's alright.  Meanwhile, several high security locations that hold classified information or materials have been broken into.  Reports claim that a giant robot is behind the crimes, so they are connected, but no one can figure out exactly who's responsible and why they are doing it.  No one would suspect that a group of fascist scientists is behind it all.

""Robot"" is a tie-in episode that brings together two completely different versions of DOCTOR WHO.  All of the action of the story takes place on Earth and the heavy involvement of UNIT all harkens to the preceding John Pertwee adventures as the Doctor.  Meanwhile, the Doctor's playful antics, the interesting use of his scarf, the witty wordplay, and longing to take a trip at the end of the episode hint at how different the Fourth Doctor is from his previous incarnations.
The plot of the story is a mish-mash between Frankenstein and King Kong.

Overall, ""Robot"" is a typical classic DOCTOR WHO episode complete with cheesy special effects.  However, with the arrival of Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor, ""Robot"" foreshadows a different type of DOCTOR WHO that is to come; one that will not be bound on Earth.

Extras on the DVD include a commentary with Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, Terrance Dicks, and Barry Letts; a featurette entitled ""Are Friends Electric?"" about the changing of the show that began in 1974 with the beginning of Tom Baker's years as the Doctor; a short segment from a British tv show called BLUE PETER that was filmed on the set of this story of DOCTOR WHO; a featurette entitled ""The Tunnel Effect"" with Barnard Lodge, the man who developed the title sequences for the first four DOCTOR WHO incarnations, including the ""time tunnel"" concept that was used throughout the Tom Baker years and has now been revived with the new DOCTOR WHO series; and production notes.",1291334400,,2812,4.8029045643153525
2783586,5,B000NVI2C4,"- The new Doctor, gazing at his new reflection: ""As for the physiognomy... well, nothing's perfect. I've to take the rough with the smooth. Mind you, I think the nose is a definite improvement. As for the ears, well, I'm not too sure.""

With the excellence of the latest crop of actors to play the Doctor (Eccleston, Tennant), Tom Baker is now sometimes overlooked. Whowouldathunkit? Was not that long ago when Tom Baker was regarded as the Doctor of choice by near everyone. Moppet-coiffed and mischievous and damn eccentric, Tom Baker sauntered in back in 1974 and instantly owned the series. To this day, he's still my favorite Doctor. But we won't talk about his passing resemblance to Harpo Marx, yeah?

Jon Pertwee bows out in episode #74 (""Planet of the Spiders""), his Doctor mortally weakened and in need of regeneration. Episode #75 (""Robot"") kicks off a four-part story arc and introduces the fourth Doctor who barely has time to settle in before he's asked to help investigate a rash of strange robberies, all having to do with a secret weapon - a disintegrator gun, to be exact. The Doctor soon stumbles onto an evil organization intent on topsy-turvying the status quo in favor of a scientific new world order.

""Robot"" isn't the most epic of the Doctor's adventures, but it's still very much fun. Tom Baker, from the get-go, injects fresh energy and a charming quirkiness. I right away took to him and liked him even better when, early on, he unexpectedly began doing calisthenics. And he made me want to invest in scarves so lengthy they could span the space-time continuum. As you can intuit from the episode's title, there's a robot in the house, and it's a murderous one, although it's suspected that it may be working against its protocol. It's hard to take the killer robot seriously, though, crafted cheesily as it was in the 1970s and, by comparison, making Robbie the Robot seem sleek and cutting edge. However, a cool thing is the parallel drawn to the Frankenstein monster and there's even a bit of that King Kong flavor. Don't be surprised should you end up sympathizing with this killer robot. A part of it recognizes that the brutal acts it's being forced to carry out conflict with its prime directive, which is to never do harm to humanity. There's a really poignant moment when this metal construct, tortured killer robot that it is, seeks out its maker, Professor Kettlewell, and pleads for his help.

This was during an era when the Doctor worked in closer tandem with the global security organization UNIT (United Nations Intelligence Taskforce), for which the Doctor often acted as scientific adviser. This means that UNIT's Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart was very much front and center, and that's a good thing. I always thought that Nicholas Courtney, with his commanding, no-nonsense presence and his innate Britishness, added something to the tale. And he always did make a terrific foil for the Doctor. And as companions to the Doctor go, the ever inquisitive journalist Sarah Jane Smith ranks as one of the most memorable. Sarah Jane was well thought of enough that she was even given her own series some short years ago. It's a good series, too. Oh, and fellow companion Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter), who was described as a Bulldog Drummond sort by the show's creators, makes his debut.

The DVD's very good special features: audio commentary by Elisabeth Sladen, writer Terrance Dicks, producer Barry Letts, and the always entertaining Tom Baker; the 39-minute-long documentary ""Are Friends Electric?"" which goes into Tom Baker's introduction as the Doctor and what went into the making of the new Doctor's first story arc; ""The Tunnel Effect"" (14 minutes) - graphic designer Bernard Lodge, who designed the show's first five title sequences, details the techniques behind the Tom Baker Doctor's tunnel vortex title sequence; a two-minute clip of ""Blue Peter"" - a popular BBC children's television program - staged on the set of the ""Robot"" episode; a photo gallery; view the Radio Times listings in PDF format (a DVD-ROM feature); and an option to view pop-up info text whilst watching the episodes (for Doctor Who fans, this is a treasure chest of fun facts).

Why the 5 star rating? This isn't the best Doctor Who story in the series, and yet I liked it quite a bit, liked it for the near soulful automaton, for Sarah Jane and the Brigadier and for the likable Harry Sullivan. But, more than those, this is where Tom Baker makes his debut, and, in terms of relevance, of historical context concerning this series, that's worth all the stars I can give the thing. I still look at him as the best Doctor. Tom Baker, with his off-left-field, larger-than-life interpretation, played the peculiar Time Lord from 1974 to 1981, and so far has held the longest running stint as the Doctor. And yet his scarf was even longer than that.",1272412800,2,4869,4.867310012062726

2783588,3,B000NVI2C4,"I have been a fan of Dr Who since I first happened upon it on a Saturday morning television. Tom Baker was already the Doctor and no one else fascinated or charmed me in that role like he did and continues to. That being said, this is one of the worst episodes I have seen. It was the first Tom Baker episode and they had not yet figured out exactly who the new character was yet. The robot was pretty silly looking, but an excellent piece of work considering the time period and budget constraints they were under. The story just doesn't work if you are over the age of 14. The extras on the DVD however are great. The interviews with Tom Baker were worth the price of the DVD to me.

2783591,4,B000NVI2C4,"This story is a great example of a typical Doctor Who story.  It really does feel like it was written for Jon Pertwee, but this makes sense because this is Tom Baker's first appearance.  Tom playing Jon's role makes the transition feel smoother, in spite of the fact that through most of the first part of the story the new Doctor seems to be confused by his transition.

One reviewer suggested that this was a homage to ""King Kong"", but I feel that it was more like ""Frankenstein"", and ""I, Robot"".  The story is a good one, an artificial life form (the robot) is created with Asimov's limitations put in place.  Right after it was activated (""born""), its prime directives are put in direct conflict with its primary orders.  The result is confusion, chaos, and, due to the immensity of the robot's intellect, and due to the combined intellects and ambitions of its creators, the world is put into danger.

This idea is amplified when the robot was made to grow larger.  I am not sure why this was necessary.  It is fun, in a way, but the special effects become bad at this point.  The story-line would have been stale if it were not for the actors which includes UNIT, the Brigadier, the evil-scientist, and the robot.  I am not sure how they pulled it off, but they did.  Tom Baker (Doctor Who) and Elizabeth Sladen (Sarah Jane Smith, his ""sidekick"") were both very entertaining.  The story is loaded with good quips and distractions, some of them very humorous.

I liked this story mostly because it seemed to take Doctor Who out of the past, old-style science fiction, into the present.  Everything seems to ""wake up"", it was like opening the shades on the windows.  Doctor Who becomes more colorful, more exciting, more interesting from this point on. I think too that this story might have been a message, from the show to the audience, as to what they should expect things to be like in Doctor Who stories from now on.",1215820800,,1925,4.568513119533527

2783597,5,B000NVI2C4,"I met Doctor Who, so to speak, in 1978 when I began reading the issue of books being published in America.  More precisely when I read an advertising booklet with Harlan Ellison's introduction and several excerpts from the first 2 books.  Harlan sounded pompous, I scoffed, but I read, and I loved.  From the books you don't get the idea that there are different actors playing the role, and that it was taken from a TV series.  Well, I was 12 at the time, too.

Then I accidentally overheard a friend's mother say she saw 'Doctor Who' on WHYY the other night in late May 1979.  I flipped out.  She probably thought I was insane as I came alive and grilled her about the details of when it was on.  And what I saw the next Friday night as episode 2 of 'Robot'.  It was hard to see the Doctor as a 40 year old kook speaking obtusely and stalking about like an eccentric maniac, but it took very little time to enjoy it.  In 1979 this TV series trounced everything America was doing on television with sci-fi, and by gar it still does (aside from the visual effects).

'Robot' is a little rough, but give it some slack - everything was changing: main actor, script editor, producer, supporting characters, writing direction, technical staff, etc.  As Dicks and Holmes shook hands on script, Letts and Hinchcliffe were handing baton in producing, while Baker stormed in and used both hands to grip the wheel of character.  And the show has all the efforts and intentions of the two best Doctor Who crews as they transferred creative power over 4 episodes.  You get the Letts-Dicks UNIT-Invasion type story with the Holmes-Hinchcliffe motives of greed, idealism and ruthless disregard for life.  Harry is a bit backwater and useless, added in case a frail actor became the Doctor, but he became a memorable companion though only in 7 stories.  Everything in the show is memorable, though, from Sarah, the doctor, the amazing Robot outfit, the goofy King Kong type situation.  It's definitely not the best story, but it has a quaint charm that isn't as embarrassing as many other Who stories.

Tom's Doctor must have been a splash of cold water over the audiences of Britain as he took the role away from the crotchety, kindly, and pompous older characterizations and did a kind of distrait, insane, genius Troughton-esque portrayal.  It's obvious why the series picked up ratings when Baker debuted from his acting alone, but also the scripts and technical efforts.

The DVD is really good.  The commentary is wonderful, and Letts-Dicks-Sladen-Baker are fun to listen to as they all have quite different personalities and rolls in the making of the story.  I wish they had Hinchcliffe in there to make it a rabble.  Commentaries from Dicks through Hinchcliffe are always fun because there was a lot of life and joy in upper ranks of the show's production at that time.  The documentary 'Are Friends Electric' is very nice, with interviews by almost everyone still alive from the show, and how they related to the show, actors, and script at the time.  Some great old script read footage was used, showing Dicks, Holmes, Baker, Marter, Christopher barry, and others hashing through before shooting began.  There is a long awaited, but truly awful, documentary about how the title sequence was made.  I am aware of how film works, and how they did post and compositing in those days, and I came away none the wiser as to how that sequence worked.  I wish they broke it down and showed examples of how it was all put together, a stage at a time.  I thought they used a reflective cone mirror at times over some airbrushed art to create the basic tunnel effect, thus the dark/matted center of screen.  But aside from that, it's a great bargain for fans of the series, and a good show for anyone who likes fun sci-fi and can look beyond effects.",1191024000,3,3836,4.665178571428571
2783598,3,B000NVI2C4,"Having watched Doctor Who since the 70's, Tom Baker is my all-time favorite Doctor (though Christopher Eccleston runs a close second)!  That said, I found this episode a bit clumsy in that Tom had not the chance to build into it his own persona.  We do begin to see a tiny bit of his style come into play toward the end of the third and in the fourth parts; however, he still uses the little yellow car for ""earthly transportation,"" and this is ill-fitting of Tom Baker (it vanishes later in his tenure).

Overall, the episode itself is not terribly dynamic.  Furthermore, while some of the Doctor Who episodes carry well through the years, this one does not.  The clumsy robot shows it's technological age (this episode is from the 70's), and the tank scene is so cheesy because the tank is so very obviously a toy replica filmed ""large"" in the foreground.  Granted, these are some of the features we love about Doctor Who, but it is not well done in this episode.  It is for these reasons I gave this episode three stars.  Never fear though, things improve with time and future episodes!",1190073600,3,1089,4.5487179487179485

But the story is still a King Kong wanna be and yet another UNIT story.

What I like about this DVD are the features including the documentary about Baker's introduction as well as the development of the opening theme credits.  The release of this DVD nearly completes the release of Baker's first season.  I'm still waiting for ""Revenge of the Cybermen"" to complete it.  Hopefully someday soon....",1189900800,,690,4.756302521008403
2783600,5,B000NVI2C4,"I cannot objectively review ""Robot"", because every line of dialogue from Part One has been burned into my memory since I was 11 years old.  I came down with the flu one Tuesday morning in January the night after this story first aired on my PBS affiliate (following the much grimmer ""Caves of Androzani"").  Home sick from school, I watched the episode four consecutive times.  Even now, 22 and a half years later, Tom Baker's clowning around in the opening minutes never fails to make me smile.

""Robot"" has always been regarded as a lightweight story, for several reasons.  First, there's the context.  It's a UNIT story sandwiched in between between several post-UNIT Jon Pertwee stories and the gothic horror that followed from producer Phillip Hinchcliffe.  Coming behind ""Invasion of the Dinosaurs"" and ""Planet of the Spiders"", it's got a much higher comedy quotient that earlier and later stories didn't attempt.  On the other side of ""Robot"" came a dozen classics running from ""The Ark In Space"" all the way down to ""Horror of Fang Rock"", all of which make this story look like an episode of the Teletubbies aired against the movie ""28 Days Later..."".

What also harms ""Robot"" is what's right up there on screen.  Producer Barry Letts, in his final outing as producer, had the sense to videotape this entire story so that the inevitable chromakey woes that dogged ""Dinosaurs"" wouldn't sink the giant robot.  Unfortunately, it didn't work.  The robot costume is huge and wobbly, and videotape chromakey doesn't look any better than film chromakey.  The robot's ankles disappear as it grows large.  A toy tank placed in the foreground for context, looks exactly like a toy tank.  Barry would have loved the CGI revolution that allowed for much better results in all-chromakey stories like this past season's ""Gridlock"".  Unfortunately, he retired 25 years too early.  ""Robot"" looks badly dated and no DVD restoration can save that.

So what's right about ""Robot""?  Just about everything else.  Tom Baker is a breath of fresh air in this story and would remain so for years.  He hits every mood except dark and foreboding, and that's just in the first 15 minutes.  Physical comedy bits such as the costume changes and the jump-rope skipping and the legs up on the desk bit have aged pretty well.  Of course it helps that there's a solid supporting cast in Nicholas Courtney, Lis Sladen and Ian Marter.

The story is not deep, but Terrance Dicks writes it tightly.  He's always been a good storyteller, even when writing derivative fifth-generation sequels for the BBC ""Doctor Who"" books a few years ago.  ""Robot"" comes from his prime.  Here we have absent-minded professors, fascist scientists and a tortured robot with a crush on a journalist, and Terrance writes it as if it were ""Casablanca"".  And, for the reocrd, Terrance actually did write ""Casablanca"" 20 years later, for the BBC books.  It's a book called ""Casastrophea"", which features the third Doctor, the Draconians, and Humphrey Bogart.

The DVD presentation of ""Robot"" is solid.  The commentary booth is quite crowded, with Baker, Sladen, Letts and Dicks talking over each other for all four episodes.  The reminiscences come pretty fast, faster than even the strictly-average text commentary (from Richard Molesworth this time) can keep up.  The 38-minute making-of documentary repeats a lot of ground from both the audio and text commentaries; the shorter featurette on the history of ""Doctor Who"" opening titles is more likly to stay with you the next morning.

The easiest comparison to draw is between ""Robot"" and ""Rose"", which opened the new ""Doctor Who"" series in 2005.  It's a fast, light-hearted premiere with little to recommend it after the technically far superior next episode (""The Ark In Space"", ""The End of the World"")... except that it's funny and not too long, and that first impression of Baker, or of Eccleston, is charming enough to last a long time and to forgive a lot of missteps later on.  Mind you, I think the nose is a definite improvement.",1188172800,,4036,4.945022288261516
2783601,5,B000NVI2C4,"Among hundreds of fine ""Doctor Who"" storylines spanning decades, ""Robot"" will always hold a special place in my heart. Discovering this show as a younger teenager and remaining an avid fan throughout the days of my youth, I watched again and again as the saga of the Doctor started right here with an earthbound adventure involving a ruthlessly manipulated and rather tragic robot almost straight out of the novels of Asimov I was then reading. On and on the tales would unfold over the weeks as the Doctor faced other perhaps more exotic foes, finally defending his homeworld from a Sontaran takeover, and then it all started back again with ""Robot""--but then kept going this time further on past ""the Invasion of Time"" until the fourth Doctor's curtain call in ""Logopolis"" and then sure enough ""Robot"" again. Third time around my local PBS station had enlarged upon its licenses and so continued on past ""Logopolis"" with the fifth and sixth Doctors and then all the way back to the third (and then came ""Robot"" yet again, this time in a new light and context), and my knowledge as a dedicated fan had likewise expanded and so I gradually became aware of my favorite show's pre-1974 history. But for the longest time Tom Baker was THE doctor and it all started here with ""Robot""--and for an even longer time it was if nothing else the originary point of ""Doctor Who"" as I knew it.

So it's almost futile to evaluate this story in the cold withering light of adult reason. Watching it just brings out the kid in me. Okay, it's not perfect, I admit. It follows the traces of some of its influences a wee bit too closely while underexploiting its one rather original idea, a scientific society bent on forcibly ordering our lives according to their ideals of reason, something along the lines of Plato's philosopher kings from ""The Republic"" but brought up to the Cold War present of the story. Upon reflection, too, their actions throughout the plotline don't quite make good sense: using a robot, the very pinnacle of human technological development, to steal the schematics and parts to make a disintegrator gun  (instead of just using their scientific know-how to make their own) and then using this gun merely to crack open a safe and steal the computer codes for the world's nukes (couldn't they just hack into the world's defense systems a la ""Wargames""?): Each segment of their plan is implausibly a major case of overkill as well as a showcase of inefficiency. Besides that, ""Robot"" has the distinguished honor of including not one but two of the most pitifully unconvincing special effects in Doctor Who history (and as any dedicated fan'll know, that's saying a lot), in both cases to realize scenes that ultimately could've been excised from the plot without harming it, too. And so on and so forth.

But you know what? Nyah nyah, so what! I'm giving it five stars anyway, so there! Which isn't completely arbitrary, after all, it must be said. ""Robot"" also has a lot of very good strong points. It's a well-paced, solid science fiction adventure in many ways, with moments of real suspense and any number of clever touches: the first-person perspective as you witness the robot's crimes through his own eyes/monitors/whatnot are particularly effective, and this eponymous robot is very memorable as a tortured and vulnerable soul in a metallic frame too powerful for its own good. His relationship with the Doctor's companion Sarah Jane is moving and handled just about right throughout, the pathos lingering in your mind long after the DVD is back in its case. Many of the supporting cast members are quite memorable as well, especially the robot's inventor, Professor Kettlewell, a character who seems to have walked straight out of the math & science department of any university I've ever known of.

Most memorable of all though is of course Tom Baker as the Doctor. As John Liosatos has so perceptively pointed out in another review here, ""Robot"" is very much a story in the style and mood of Baker's predecessor, a transition of sorts. And yet it's disarming--almost eerie--how very much Tom Baker's take on the character of the fourth Doctor bursts forth in full form, in all its wacky and eccentric glory, right here even in the first of the story's four episodes. Some actors take a while to ease into this role, some longer than others, and we always let them off the hook in this regard if their characters aren't so well defined at first. But the very first scene you see the fourth Doctor conscious, it's already undeniably him and no other. And quite simply, he's superb, and it's easy to see why he was voted most popular Doctor year after year, ceding that honor only recently to the Doctor's current tenth incarnation fresher in the memories of the show's newfound fans. Well, since my early days when he was the ONLY Doctor a lot has changed, I've seen nine other fine actors play the role before and after in their own magnificent fashions and I've thought highly of them all, and yet when it comes right down to it I have to admit that in this household anyway the crazy one with the trademark scarf whom my Dad used to call ""Harpo Marx in Space"" is still tops--and ""Robot"" still marks his illustrious entrance.",1188000000,,5242,4.757142857142857
2783602,4,B000NVI2C4,"Released in August 2007, BBC DVD offers a pair of stories from the classic Doctor Who archives that represent both a new dawn and the final end for the original show, which ran from November 1963 to December 1989. Robot was broadcast just days before the start of 1974, heralding the arrival of Tom Baker in the role of the intrepid Time Lord, launching what would come to be seen as the golden age of the iconic series, whereas Survival, from December 1989, represents the final end to the show and a 16 year hiatus for the Gallifreyan's TV adventures.

It was more than just the arrival of Tom Baker as the 4th Doctor that represented the new beginning at the start of season 12. Behind the scenes, Producer Barry Letts and Script Editor Terrance Dicks were both handing over the reigns of the show they'd overseen since 1969. Dicks had already passed on the editorship to Robert Holmes, but penned Robot at his own insistence, marking it the first ever solo script he'd contributed to show he'd been involved with since 1968. Letts was in the producer's chair for the final time, being closely shadowed by his successor, Philip Hinchcliffe. Also fading out were the Earth bound stories featuring the UNIT team, with this being the penultimate adventure for the Brigadier, the long suffering foil to both the Troughton and Pertwee Doctors. His sidekick Benton would also be making only rare appearances in the future, although this story did introduce a new UNIT character, Harry Sullivan, played so brilliantly by Ian Marter, who would join Elisabeth Sladen's Sarah-Jane Smith as the Doctor's traveling companion for the entire season. So many changes and yet this story is still so familiar with the ground that had been set for Earth bound stories for the past five or six years. Indeed, it's very much part of the Pertwee era of story telling and very unlike most of what came after it. It's a simple story, but it works well and certainly leaves the viewers intrigued as to who the new Doctor might be.

By the time Survival hit the screens 15 years later; most viewers were simply intrigued as to how the show continued to survive at all. It had been slowly dying for quite some time and although it had survived one cancellation in 1985, its expiration was never really far away. Ghost Light was in fact the last story recorded, but Survival became the last transmitted. Not that many were aware of that at the time and it was only much later that it became clear the programme was not coming back.

Part of the reason for its demise is clearly seen in this story itself, a 3 part adventure written by TV newcomer Rona Munro. Munro went on to became a much acclaimed script writer, but within the ""grand master plan"" of script editor Andrew Cartmell's vision for the show, the scripts being produced were far to confusing and impossible for viewers to follow. Plus, Sylvester McCoy was proving to be a remarkably unpopular 7th Doctor, with ratings plummeting. McCoy does indeed seem way out of his depth and his almost unintelligible dialogue and extremely strange annunciation was as confusing to the viewers as the storylines themselves. What exactly is going on in Survival is anyone's guess!

Regardless of the story quality, which is largely subjective, what usually makes the Doctor Who DVDs so worth the money are the extras that the restoration team pulls together for each release. However, not for the first time, they've really over-egged the pudding on the Survival issue and stretched some very thin ideas to two discs and a much higher retail price. For such a short story, this seems particularly unfair on the fans willing to make the purchase. There are two fairly lengthy documentaries about the making of this short story and another looking at what ""might have been"" had there been another year of the show. Sylvester, together with his companion Ace, Sophie Aldred, and Cartmell figure prominently in all the documentaries, so their commentary for the episodes themselves becomes completely redundant as it's all said elsewhere. One neat idea is that episode 3 also carries an alternative commentary from some competition winning fans. There's also some frankly weird programming for children and a video piece featuring Anthony Ainley as The Master included, both of which are just plain annoying and seem to be there to pad the discs rather than to entertain.

The Robot extras are much more interesting, but again disappointing. So much of what Tom Baker, Barry Letts, Terrance Dicks and Elisabeth Sladen say in the commentary is again repeated elsewhere on the disc and indeed they've said it all before on many other DVD releases. There's a repeat inclusion of an excerpt from Blue Peter too. At the time the show was being made, a documentary crew were following the team, but only some limited, silent excerpts from that are used here, most of which, again, have been used on earlier DVD releases. It's entertaining what's here; it's just getting a bit tired and repetitive. Hopefully this is just a blip and future DVD's featuring the good Doctor will restore the normally very high standards and the repetition can be avoided, especially since it's repetitive in the case of Survival only to fill the space and justify cost.

Any fan will want to have these discs without question, even it it's just to have the immaculately restored picture and sound of the original stories. Casual viewers may perhaps want to save their pennies.",1187481600,,5470,4.832443970117396
2783603,5,B000NVI2C4,"Cool Doctor Who story and cool DVD.I just got done watching the DVD release of Robot and I was realy impressed. Robot looks better then ever on DVD.Also included on the DVD is a nice making of Robot including interviews with Tom Baker and others. As for the story I have always enjoyed watching Robot,this is Tom Bakers debut story and it's realy good. And unlike some other debut Doctors we get right into the story instead of having the first part of the story with The Doctor recovering from his regenaration, the 4th Doctor recovers quickly and is ready for action within 10 mins of part 1. Well anyways the BBC has done a great job with Robot on DVD.I'm sure my copy of Robot will be in my DVD player alot.",1187222400,,711,4.353383458646617
2783604,5,B000NVI2C4,"Strange title, don't you think? PLUS ONE. What could I be referring to?  While this is Tom Baker's debut story, it contains all the elements of a Jon Pertwee story. Thus, the Pertwee era is extended by one story.  This was done to ease the transition into a new Doctor, so the audience can accept Tom Baker.  And except him they did. He became the longest-running, most beloved Doctor of them all.  It all starts with Robot in what is a pretty good effort from all involved.

However, let's not forget the previous Doctor Who era, the Pertwee UNIT years, arguably the best era in Doctor Who history.  Robot harkens back to the Pertwee years. An earth-based setting, a radical organization blackmailing the powers that be with atomic war to dominate the world, a sympathetic ""mad"" scientist/villain whose good intentions are misused, UNIT.  Those of us who are fans of the UNIT days will note that Robot represents one of the last times UNIT plays a major role in Doctor Who.  They won't be seen again until next season's Terror of The Zygons. Robot also introduces a new companion, Harry Sullivan, played by Ian Marter, who would go on to play a major role in Doctor Who after leaving the show, penning many novelizations of Who stories.  However, as far as the television show is concerned, Harry was short-lived, as the producers originally intended for a much older actor to replace Pertwee. And Harry was brought in to handle the any physical deeds the role demanded, much like Ian Chesterton did during the William Hartnell era.  When the part was offered to a relatively young man, Tom Baker, Harry became superfluous and was rendered useless, and basically is reduced to comic relief and someone for Sarah to threaten every time he calls her ""old girl"".

The title character Robot is very well realized, save for the normal CSO problems the production team experienced during the 70s.  But isn't that part of the charm of classic Doctor Who?  In addition, the often-mocked blatant toy tank which shows up in front of the bunker can be overlooked with a little imagination. I've always said if you want Star Wars-type effects, go watch Star Wars. Somehow, I doubt classic Doctor Who would be the same with modern effects.  You only need to look at the new series for proof of that.

Tom Baker really doesn't begin his typical run of stories until the next, story, Ark In Space. Robot offers us a chance to remember the Pertwee years, as it is a Third Doctor story with the Fourth in the lead.",1185667200,2,2498,4.671232876712328
2783605,4,B000NVI2C4,"Historically the regeneration episodes can be weak storied venues, only serving the introduction of a new actor to the role of the 700+ Timelord. Unfortunately, ""Robot"" is no different there, the story is ultimately a twist on King Kong (you'll likely see that referenced alot from the rest of the reviewers, it is pretty clear, in the final act the sympathic Robot iconically holds Sarah like Faye Wray.

Baker is brillant as the 4th Doctor, from the first mutterings post regeneration to the manic technobabble, contradictory disapproval and dependence of/on the millitary. This is one of the last true UNIT stories, a safety net for whomever took over for Jon Pertwee's Earth Bound 3rd Doctor. The Brig. and crew would return as a team to face the ""Terror of the Zygons"" and ""Android Invasion"" though. He relationship with Sarah and the freshly introduced Doctor Harry Sullivan are compelling, so much so that the Sarah Jane Smith character is returning yet again in Fall '07 (following a successful solo New Year Special  and her appearance on the second season of the new Dr. Who).

Overall, still a pleasure to watch.

2783606,4,B000NVI2C4,"while a pretty good start(considering 1974 had some grey Jon Pertwee epsiosdes as well) it is very lacking in some of the passion and intrigue(for lack of a better word) in the following stories, Ark in Space, hitherto.  don't listen to the amazon post of ""1975"" on EVERY ting.  this was released in 1974 and it was the last of that season.

8181551,5,B000NVI2C4,"Definitely one of, if not The most auspicious debut of a television character!
Tom Baker perfectly defines his Doctor admirably in this, his first adventure titled Robot, and pop culture would forever be changed.
His genius and enthusiasm are off the wall authentic. Fascinating performance.
The story itself is rather simple but the characters are fairly sophisticated. The way they go about things is interesting.
The King Kong homage is very obvious but not plagiarist.
A wonderful effort by all, very professional, whimsical and stylish.

Are Friends Electric? is the friendliest documentary I have seen for the fourth Doctor, extremely well done. Intimate and informative.
It runs only about 38 minutes, a bit too short.
It is so wonderful to hear Mr. Baker's honest comments regarding his life's work, very enlightening.

Are Friends Electric is also the title for one of my favorite songs by Gary Numan, a Futurist masterpiece. I'm surprised there is no connection with this documentary.

I purchased this release (and many others) in its PAL Region 2 format because it sells for around $8 NEW while the NTSC Region 1 version sells for about $40 USED!
I can't get my PAL Doctor Who discs to look the same as their NTSC counterparts, the live video segments look  more like film. This is not a bad thing, it helps to soften the harsh blue screen work. Both versions of all releases seem identical but special features and easter eggs are sometimes presented in a different order.
I really enjoy collecting the British discs, I have easily saved hundreds of dollars by doing so.
