8706348,5,B00UGQ31X6,"One of the best TV series on the planet. Wish they could have continued it, but at least they gave us some closure with Serenity. Highly recommended.",1497052800,,149,4.555555555555555
8706349,5,B00UGQ31X6,"one of my alltime favorite TV series, especially of the sf variety. Intelligent, thoughtful, not trying to out-fx the last episode (or other series), just right.

They covered a LOT of ground in only fourteen episodes. One wonders how much else they could have gone into if the series had been in a better timespace (Fox, a year after 9/11, when most Americans just wanted to blow up bad guys, not delve into the lives of the LOSERS of a war) and had been given the time and backing to keep going.

So that's why I would LOVE to see a reboot of the series. Not because of any weaknesses of the original (though like every series, there was a clunker episode or two), but just to see the full story play out (and continue) in a more conducive environment. It was, ironically, hindered by being on a major network (ratings NOW!!!) and a feature film (explosions NOW!!! Zombies!!!). Everything that was rushed and stereotyped about the Serenity movie would be WONDERFUL played out over a full season or two, with plenty of time to give the characters room to breathe.",1494028800,2,1064,4.56544502617801

8706351,5,B00UGQ31X6,"Good Heavens!  Are you reading this review because you haven't seen the entire Firefly series yet?

Or the follow on film Serenity?

I strongly urge you to correct this unfortunate oversight forthwith!

No, no, don't thank me.  Just get on with it.  Tempus Fugit!",1490572800,5,263,4.863636363636363
8706352,4,B00UGQ31X6,"Kinda like the rebellious, yet humorous spirit pervading the first seasons. I expect it to slowly -- or not -- fade away with time, but it feels good while it lasts. Nathan Fillion (What! Is he related to a former French Prime Minister?) is as good as in Castle and the supporting actors do a fine job in terms of credibility. Enjoy it while the script writer(s) still have some inspiration.",1485648000,2,391,4.52112676056338
