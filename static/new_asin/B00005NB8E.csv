7946620,5,B00005NB8E,One of Pink Amota's prettiest story. A high quality anime that actually  makes sense in the givin amount of time.  Features the voice of the ever so  popular Megumi Hayashibara whom also did voice for Lina Inverse from  Slayers.  A Boy is blessed with a family sword that has the power to open  the demon and human world.  His job along with the caretaker of the sword  is to banish the stay demons that roam in the human world.  Extra interview  of the voice cast is a great bonus. Extremely halarious to see how the  voice actors do their job while having fun ^_^.,965952000,4,566,4.346153846153846
