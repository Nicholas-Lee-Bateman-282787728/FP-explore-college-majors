5901267,5,B00EBJ64GA,"This is basically the same program as the Instant Video Francis: The Pope from the New World. The subtitling is more accurate and better captures what is being said. It is a great program. Francis is a very inspiring person. The video really captures who he is, where he came from and it really gives you a sense of  how he might transform the Catholic Church. Highly recommended to anyone  who wants to learn more about Pope Francis.",1387152000,2,434,4.551282051282051
5901268,2,B00EBJ64GA,"This movie was a little swayed to the ""left"" in its presentation of the Pope.  Although my leanings are also to the ""left"", I didn't think it was a comprehensive representation.  I also purchased another movie entitled, ""Francis:  The Pope from the New World (2013)"".  I liked this other movie better and thought it was more balanced and accurate.",1386288000,4,347,4.830508474576271

8603606,3,B00EBJ64GA,since I am not catholic but just wanted to learn alittle about Pope Francis. Instead of making several dvd's they should have made one dvd that would go into more detail about his life and his contribution to the vatican. But a good introduction to him,1428451200,,252,4.5

8603611,5,B00EBJ64GA,"This 54-minute (not 60 minutes, despite what the DVD jacket says) documentary on Pope Francis is a co-production of the Argentinian Catholic Church. Although there is a Spanish-language version of this DVD, this disc features only English-subtitled Spanish as a language option, and there is only a ""play"" option on the main menu. Unlike 'Who is Pope Francis?"" and ""Francis: The Pope from the New World,"" this film (titled ""Pope Francis: A Pope For Everyone"") features extensive footage of Pope Francis during his tenure as cardinal-archbishop of Buenos Aires, and it's some very impressive stuff (including his homily after a 2012 accident in a popular Buenos Aires disco killed more than 100 people) that I haven't seen anywhere else. Likewise, the vast majority of interviewees are Argentinian priests and laypeople (as well as Rabbi Abraham Skorka) who know Francis personally. The few non-Argentinian interviewees include the well-chosen Jesuit Fathers Antonio Spadaro -- who conducted the famous August 2013 interview published in ""America"" magazine in the U.S. -- and Federico Lombardi the Vatican spokesman. These elements of the film are impressive.

Unlike the other documentaries available on the English-speaking market, this film exclusively uses subtitles (rather than dubbing) for non-English speakers. So the film consists of an endless stream of subtitles (not a single person here speaks English, but always Spanish or Italian) punctuated by an occasional English narration. The subtitling is not a bad thing in itself, but most of the people in this film speak very rapidly, and the subtitles move so quickly that it gave me a headache at times. Sometimes I missed what a speaker was saying because I glanced for a split second at the blurb identifying him or her. The film begins with a breathless, too-rapid narration of the pope's childhood and background (dispensed with in what feels like 5-7 minutes) before giving us some footage of the papal inauguration and then plunging us into a long series of archival footage and interviews based in Argentina.

Much of the material here is compelling and insightful, but the Knights of Columbus-produced ""Francis: The Pope From the New World"" gives you the same thing with judicious amounts of English dubbing to make it easier to understand rapid speakers. The ""Who is Pope Francis?"" DVD released in the U.S. Ignatius Press, despite some poor pronunciations in its English narration and dubbing, is also better than this film at giving a simple overview of the pope's career. This DVD tends to be talky and repetitive, emphasizing the themes of Francis' preaching and personality, and lacking a central narrative focus. His concern for the poor and marginalized, and his willingness to reach out to all people, are the main focus here. But this information is conveyed in a rambling and circular fashion. The disc is probably more palatable for native Spanish speakers who don't need to follow the subtitles.

Nevertheless, you'll enjoy this film if you like Pope Francis, particularly the warm insights of the interviewees and the extensive footage of Cardinal Bergoglio washing feet on Holy Thursday and speaking out in the streets of Buenos Aires. So although I prefer other documentaries on Pope Francis, and will not keep this one in my personal library, I recommend it for anyone who wants a little more of Francis. It presents Francis as the pope of the poor through his own words, particularly in its extensive footage of him preaching as archbishop, and through the comments of several Argentinians who know him pretty well.",1392076800,5,3601,5.173241852487135
8603612,5,B00EBJ64GA,"This video gives insights into the first Pope from the Americas, his faith, humility, passion, personality.  Viewers can learn of Pope Francis' earlier life as Jorge Mario Bergoglio and be inspired by his life of serving the poor and marginalized and meeting the challenges of our times.",1390003200,,287,5.1063829787234045
