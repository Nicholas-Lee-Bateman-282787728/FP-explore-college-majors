6263866,5,B00IHA2RRO,"Not all online shows are created equal, and ever since day one the Game Chasers have always delivered a solidly consistent show. Their mission: to find all the wonderful games that defined our childhood. The leading players, Billy and Jay are constantly faced with all the challenges that come with retro game hunting. Watch as they attempt to achieve game chasing greatness while using a combination of talent, experience, and charm. All while avoiding territory that is filled with resellers, competing game hunters, and Pat Contri.",1392508800,3,534,5.22093023255814
6263867,5,B00IHA2RRO,"When I first popped in the DVDs I thought I had been ripped off because there were ugly people on my TV screen and I did not understand why. But then I did some research and discovered that these people are, in fact, the Game Chasers. I thought the Game Chasers were supposed to be sexy. Well after a few alcoholic beverages they are indeed quite sexy. But seriously this is a very professional package. You get a cardboard digibook style box (not sure the proper term for this style of case but it fits). The inside is plastic and the two discs are easy to remove and insert and won't flop around or come loose. I've had so many studio DVDs where the cases were just awful or the tabs holding the discs easily broke. The artwork on the box is also outstanding as is the graphical design throughout. This is also true with the program itself. The menus are all creative with 8-bit caricatures of the protagonists and their sidekicks. There's hidden stuff in the menus as well but there's an easy way to find it which I WON'T TELL YOU. As for the show itself it's great fun to watch and you really get in to what these guys find and how they come across it. Yeah, it's low-brow stuff some times but that just makes it better. And be sure to check out the episode which is included here that's not available anywhere else. As you're watching you'll think it was edited by God Hisself. Or if you don't believe in God you'll think it was edited by Carl Sagan or maybe Neil deGrasse Tyson or at the very least Bill Nye the Science Guy. It's a good episode and feels like a full, real deal one. The commentaries are also great. I am writing way too much just be sure to get this.",1392508800,7,1673,4.264150943396227
6263868,5,B00IHA2RRO,"Such an awesome DVD here, hours of fun and entertainment from season 1 of The Game Chasers.

The series follows Billy and Jay in their search for rare and obscure retro video games.

Contents include the first season of 10 episodes plus 2 other episodes, 2 animated cartoon episodes, heaps of outtakes and deleted scenes, heaps of interviews and more!

It's something that is well worth your money and will look good in your video game collection even! Can't recommend it enough!",1392508800,6,479,4.817073170731708
6263869,5,B00IHA2RRO,"I think it's awesome. But then again I made it so maybe Im a little bias. Woot. Yeah. yolo. I did NOT just say yolo....

Get it up 6 inches, get it in 6 inches. But I digress.

and remember kids, please don't jar.",1392508800,5,213,3.8181818181818183
6263870,5,B00IHA2RRO,"Ive been a fan of the game chasers on youtube since the forth episode, Billy and Jay's personality shines through the episodes, as does their passion for finding old games.

What is it? Its basically american pickers but with old video games, you get a lot of content in these discs, the quality is high and its amazing really what one guy can produce at home these days, you would not be surprised to one day see this on the history channel.

To summarise, Im looking forward to the subsequent seasons coming out on DVD (or bluray hopefully!)",1392508800,4,543,4.530612244897959

8642091,5,B00IHA2RRO,"Lots of extras and fun features make the dvds worthwhile. BUT...at the time of this review someone is selling the set for 89.99. Buy for 15.00 straight from the game chasers' website.

89.99 is asking too much.

edit: although the game chasers' website doesn't have season 1 listed anymore I saw a comment by billy that said he was ordering more and would hopefully have them by oct.",1434672000,,394,4.695652173913044
8642092,5,B00IHA2RRO,"This is hands down one of the best shows out there related to retro video games. Shady Jay and Billy Chaser scour flea markets, pawn shops, second hand stores and craigslist in search of sweet video game deals. With their trusty cameramen, Melvor and Dodongo, they showcase the art of the deal and the thrill of the hunt. The episodes on this DVD are not without hilarious robot dancing and catching each other slipping. That's just the way game chasing go! Highly recommended!",1392508800,,477,4.759036144578313
8642093,5,B00IHA2RRO,It was so much fun watching all the extended episode on the dvd set. It was a great buy for sure!,1392508800,,97,3.6666666666666665
8642094,5,B00IHA2RRO,"Today, the internet is full of videos about collecting and playing retro video games. The Game Chasers manages to stand out above others with it's excellent production values and hilarious commentary. Armed with cameras, they hit up tons of garage sales, flea markets, craigslist ads, and more. The show provides great insight into how to collect video games, as well as some great information about the actual game. Highly recommended, you will watch this over and over again.",1392508800,,477,5.128205128205129
8642095,5,B00IHA2RRO,"First of all, let me point out that I barely play video games and do not  collect them at all. That being said, this series is fun for so many different reasons than just video games. Unlike most ""picker/hunter/chaser"" shows, there are no staged conflicts, planted ""finds"" or any of the other obvious tricks that those major network shows try to fool you with. It's just a bunch of dudes who act on camera just like they do off camera. I am lucky to live in Dallas and have met The Game Chasers on several occasions and they are genuine people. As far as the quality of the DVD goes, it is top notch and on par with any release by a major network. buy it now before you have to pay $100 on e-bay for it!!!!!!!",1392508800,,709,4.175182481751825
8642096,5,B00IHA2RRO,"For those of you not familiar with The Game Chasers, the series is a YouTube original that follows two men (and multiple guests) around the state of Texas (and often other parts of the United States) as they search for rare and retro video games. As they make their way to various flea markets, thrift stores, antique shops, and game conventions they share their unique finds and words of wisdom, often intermixed with crude humor, the passing of gas, and acts of kindness/friendship. As you watch the series you begin to develop an attachment to the protagonists, Billy and Jay, as they are salt of the Earth people engaging in a hobby that is picking up in popularity. Whether you are curious about the hobby or are a 20-something who is fulfilling his/her childhood dreams of owning all of those video games you couldn't have, you will find some relevancy and a lot of value in the content of these DVDs.

The series continues to run on YouTube, and the DVD in question is a culmination of their videos from the first season. While the series airs primarily on YouTube the quality of production far exceeds the guerrilla-style filming often present on the popular video-sharing website. The video quality is impressive, transitions and cutaways are well done, green screen is used appropriately, and the audio/background music is nicely done. Billy, who does the majority of the editing, puts quite a bit of time into ensuring that the show is well done. Technical aspects aside the content is very engaging and would not be out of place on popular cable TV networks airing shows such as ""Storage Wars,"" ""American Pickers,"" or ""Pawn Stars."" Having said this the characters in the series do NOT take themselves too seriously, keeping the content humble and fun to watch. The show, subjectively speaking, is a far more authentic narrative than the aforementioned cable series.

The DVD itself builds upon the quality of production that the show prides itself on. The packaging is of high quality and there are many ""Easter eggs"" in the packaging itself, including the background of the inserts, the discs themselves, etc. Having originally pre-ordered the DVD I was pleasantly surprised to see neat surprises that exceeded my expectations. The DVDs themselves have been remastered and feature additional content, audio commentary, and much more, giving the viewer a unique experience that justifies the investment beyond enjoying the series on YouTube.

Billy and Jay have taken part in every step that went into the production of the DVD, with the exception of the physical printing and pressing of the DVDs and packaging itself; they wanted to keep the quality of this part of the package professional and it really shows. Having said that, the cover art, inserts, DVD art, title screen, chapter selection screen, etc., was all completely done by hand (or through a computer) by Billy and Jay. The product is a labor of love and it really shows.

Subjectively speaking the entire package is an impressive demonstration of two individuals expressing their passion through media. Objectively speaking the DVD is a solid product, from the packaging to the DVD-exclusive content, and the actual show itself. For the money you will not be disappointed in this package, as you will learn more about the hobby of game collecting and feel like you made a few friends along the way.",1392508800,,3376,4.9488536155202825

In this movie they are chasing games. In Texas. Big state. They meet people, wax a snatchie, visit flea markets and stuff.
The plot of the movie is -wait, what? This is a web series? Really? But it looks so professional! Oh ok... they are THAT good?
So it's well worth the money! And it's funny, entertaining and educating too! And all the hidden extras! Awesome!
