5553038,4,B00B2BUZ7O,"I just finished this workout and wanted to give my immediate impressions of it.

First major impression: thumbs up!

I did the entire workout, which clocked in at 40:09. This is billed as a 30-minute workout with a separate 5-minute active warm up and a separate 10-minute toning/yoga stretch. Since I played it all, I'm not sure which section came up short.

The colors are nice and light - white and light blue - with soft music. Ivy is entirely pleasant and very, very fit.

This is a solid intermediate workout with virtually no impact. It does, however, have a strong yoga influence, and Ivy is obviously trained as she has a perfect down dog split and beautiful back extension in Locust and reverse plank. The only ""impact"" is when you hop from a down dog into chair; there are other points at which she also hops from down dog into various moves, as well, but you can easily just step forward if you're not used to doing this move.

I used five-pound dumbbells and an 8-pound weight in lieu of a kettlebell, which worked perfectly. You also need a chair (I used my wooden Firm stool).

This workout is pretty much nonstop, and I worked up a nice sweat doing it. She moves quickly from move to move, and you never do too many of any one thing. I really liked the Bear Crawl, where you literally crawl back and forth from a down dog and back several times. I also liked the various no-impact cardio moves. There is a nice little challenging section of planks interspersed with Locust/back extensions. There are also what Anna Benson called Hemispheres, where you lean over, place your hands flat on a chair, and lift one leg up, out to the side, tap down, and come back again.

You move from weight work to unweighted work throughout, and from standing to the floor and back again, several times. It's truly a fusion-feeling workout. I am not even sure how to classify it; it's strength oriented with a cardio effect.

Although I'm doing 99 percent streaming workouts now, this is the first dvd workout I've liked in a long time. I could see myself doing this once a week.

My only caveat is that Ivy cues on the move rather than before it, so I missed some reps. This is not a deal breaker for me.

Overall I'm very happy I bought this! :)",1359504000,26,2245,4.453658536585366

5553040,5,B00B2BUZ7O,"this video is very low impact...I have MS and chose it because of the reviews...I like the format of the video very much- she does a great job! the disease as it is, I wore out quickly but will get to it after taking a brief interlude)! still love the dvd:)!",1393113600,,258,4.078431372549019
5553041,5,B00B2BUZ7O,"This really is a nice workout with no impact, but it has intensity. It uses a variety of moves and styles and has a nice stretch at the end.

5553042,5,B00B2BUZ7O,Ivy now has a big fan.  She has inspired me to eat clean and taught me so much through her book.  Everyone should get this book if you are interested in investing in your health and the overall quality of your life.,1379980800,,215,4.095238095238095
5553043,4,B00B2BUZ7O,This is a little tough...lol! I worked up a good sweat doing this. The video is very doable but there are a couple of moves that were challenging for me. I pushed through BUT I DO NOT think this is for beginners at all. When I think of Beginners I think of Leslie Sansone and Richard Simmons. This is far from that level to me...I'm just sayinnnn! Great workout though! I like her fresh style!,1379030400,,393,4.253333333333333
5553044,5,B00B2BUZ7O,"I am a mom of 4 kids (including a set of 4 year old twins) so I am very busy.  I literally own at least 50 workout DVD's and I am always looking for something new.  So despite all my DVD options this is the one that I always seem to return to and use most often.  It is fast paced and challenging, but easy to follow for a beginner.  She uses ""real world"" movements working the muscles you need to strengthen for a busy mom, like putting something heavy on a top shelf.  She managed to use a lot of movements that I have not seen before so you are working your muscles in a very unique and interesting way.  Some DVD's I have tried have great exercises but the host is either very boring, hard to follow, or SO upbeat its obnoxious.  Ivy was perfect!  The studio was well lit, and beautiful. The music was motivating but not so loud I could not hear the cues, and I feel energized when I am finished.  It is a perfect mix of weights, K-bell, and yoga.  She also has you do some stretching in between sets which I liked.  If you want a great overall total body workout in 30 min you can't go wrong with this DVD!  You are doing exercises for tight, toned, lean muscles (not bulky, you will be getting smaller not bigger) plus cardio, and all in 30 min.  There is no set up, no special equipment.  I do this first thing in the morning in my pajamas, no shoes required!  I keep my weights by the TV and use my couch instead of a chair.  I usually do this before the kids wakeup but it is something you could do with the kids running around in the same room.  Some k-bell DVD's I own could actually be really dangerous if my kids got in the way.  I really tired hard to find something wrong with it so my review seemed more balanced and thoughtful but I honestly couldn't!!!  It was great, I  REALLY LOVE THIS DVD!!!!!",1378684800,3,1814,4.113960113960114
5553045,4,B00B2BUZ7O,"This is a great low-impact conditioning workout. Ivy does move a bit fast from one move to the next, but after doing the dvd just a few times you are able to anticipate what's coming. The workout covers all the major muscle groups, keeps a steady high-heart rate and includes some really unique moves that I haven't seen before (Bear Crawls, anyone?)",1377734400,,350,4.661290322580645

5553047,4,B00B2BUZ7O,"I have never done a Kettlebell workout, and I was excited to try this one.  It was a great challenge.  I enjoyed the pacing and exercises, and I look forward to getting stronger and keeping up with the instructor.  It is a nice change of pace from a typical dumbbell workout.  I like that it was a whole body workout, only one half hour, and incorporated the floor and chair.  I would recommend this DVD.",1368403200,3,404,4.333333333333333
5553048,2,B00B2BUZ7O,"I so badly wanted to like this DVD, but I just don't.  Ivy is sweet & seems to know her stuff, but this is the most disjointed workout I've ever done. Pickup your weights, put down your weights, sit down, stand up, on you knees, stand up again, weights, no weights, up, down, etc, etc.  It's exhausting just trying to keep up with all the up & down, back & forth. I'm not sure what all of the rapid changes are supposed to accomplish. Also, Ivy is not very good at queuing in advance, so I missed the first two or three reps of nearly every move.",1368057600,7,546,4.093457943925234
5553057,5,B00B2BUZ7O,"I like doing workout videos rather than going to the gym, and I like variety. So every once in awhile I pick up a new DVD. The no impact label is what attracted me, because I like my yoga tapes, and weight workouts that aren't fast and furious (depending on my mood).

Well.

I did this workout and the next day my muscles told me that I had gotten a GREAT workout. I couldn't do all of it...the full pushups and the side planks. But I'm okay with modifying things as I work up to them.

I also read another reviewer that said they used a weight (mine was an 8 lb one) instead of a kettle bell and that worked fine. It did. So if you don't have a kettle bell, you can still do the workout.

Bottom line is that I love having this DVD as part of my selection! Glad I purchased it.",1367366400,,779,3.9743589743589745
5553058,5,B00B2BUZ7O,"Love the yoga inspired workout!!!!

5553059,4,B00B2BUZ7O,"I had never heard of fitness instructor Ivy Ingram Larson prior to trying this DVD.  Although she could easily pass for a college student, she mentions in her Introduction that she is a 36-year old mom.  Even more remarkably, Larson was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in her early 20s, and when making this DVD, she was still in recovery from major surgery that left her unable to walk for SIX months.  Therefore, she set about designing a workout that would be accessible to those with health limitations and would have NO impact.  Larson also notes that her three background exercisers are all her best friends, and they each have their own fitness challenges (e.g., one is pregnant, one has had knee surgeries).  One background exerciser shows modifications for many of the exercises during the workout.

The Main Menu of this DVD offers the following options:  Introduction - Play All - Warm Up - 30 Minute Solution - Stretch and Firm - For Best Results - About Ivy.  The fact that this routine is repeatedly billed as a 30 minute workout is unfortunately rather misleading.  The Warm-Up is 5 minutes long, the ""30 Minute Solution,"" or main body of the workout, is 27 minutes long, and the Stretch and Firm is 8.5 minutes--so, if you do just the Warm-Up/main portion, it is 33 minutes, and if you do the ENTIRE workout, it is even longer at 41.5 minutes.  This workout requires a variety of equipment, including a kettlebell, dumbbells, and a chair.  For intermediates, Larson recommends a 5-8 pound kettlebell and 3-5 pound dumbbells.

The Warm-Up starts with Around the Worlds, a reach up overhead and down to the side, performing several in each direction.  Larson then quickly comes into a forward bend (my hamstrings definitely did NOT feel ready for this) and then moves into plank, bending and straightening the legs.  Jumping forward, she keeps up the pace with fast-moving standing exercises such as pulsing chair pose, side bends, squat to side leg lift, squat to standing star, and pulsing side-to-side squat.

The main workout starts with picking up the kettlebell for diagonal overhead reaches from side-to-side.  This is followed by one-armed kettlebell swings (which Larson does by pushing her hips forward beyond perpendicular, which I do not believe is correct), and a fast-paced deadlift-like move where the kettlebell starts at the chest and then reaches towards the floor.  Then its down to the mat for push-ups, a one-legged bridge, a crunch with dumbbell overhead press, and two kneeling moves, pelvic rotations (a.k.a. ""knee dancing"") and a pelvic raise with weighted overhead pull-down (using dumbbells).

Going back to the kettlebell, Larson stands in a wide plie and performs an upright row.  This is followed by a little cardio break:  rapid speed bag to either side and then rapid cross of the arms in front.  Next, it's back to the kettlebell, this time holding it in one hand for an overhead press while performing a side lift with the opposite leg.  (Note:  Larson holds the ball of the kettlebell here, not the handle.)  Larson then repeats the previous deadlift-like move, this time bringing the arms from overhead and then down to the floor.

Now it's time to go back to the mat, for for a ""bear walk"" (simply a crawl forward and back) and then bridges with both feet on the chair.  This is followed by a plank series that involves alternating between elbow plank, superman, and a flutter three times.  Returning to a standing plie, Larson performs what she calls a ""high pull,"" really a two-handed press overhead.  This is followed by pulsing squats and then a punch break.  Next, you'll place your hands on the chair for semi-circle leg lifts out to either side.  You'll then sit on the chair for a combination anterior delt raise, stand, overhead press, and squat back to the chair to repeat.  Larson concludes with additional mat work.  First, she sits in a c-curve position and tosses one dumbbell from hand to hand as she twists from side-to-side.  Next, she holds the kettlebell for a half getup-type move, then performs hip raises and mermaids (oblique crunches) all on the same side before repeating these three moves on the other side.

The final segment, Stretch and Firm, combines yoga postures with more traditional stretches; as with the rest of the workout, all of the movements flow from one to the other.  Larson starts by going from warrior 2 to reverse warrior to side stretch, repeating this series several times.  She performs a shoulder stretch in the center and then repeats the series on the other side.  Next comes down dog with a knee in and chair pose adding a twist.  She concludes on the floor with seated forward bend.

Although I did enjoy the variety of movements in this workout, I had a few problems with it as well.  I generally consider myself in the high intermediate range for strength workouts, and I found Larson's weights recommendations to be WAY off for me.  The second time I did the workout, I found I needed to have at least two sets of dumbbells available (8# and 10#) and the ONLY time I used my kettlebell (12kg, or about 26#) was for the swings, as it just didn't seem to work well for the other movements.  Taking the time to find the right weight was difficult, however, as Larson moves SO fast that there is virtually no time for setup between the moves; I had to pause the DVD many times when doing this workout.  She also provides virtually no form pointers throughout the entire workout.  Also, as I noted above, I really didn't feel sufficiently prepared by her warm-up moves, and I think that in order to use the main portion of this workout, I am going to need to do my own warm-up.

Despite the flaws of this routine, I still gave the DVD 4 stars because I liked Larson, and I think she created a unique workout here.  I would be interested in future efforts from her--hopefully, she will slow things down just a little bit and make it easier for viewers to follow along.  In the meantime, I would definitely recommend this DVD for experienced exercisers ONLY, as I think beginners would be completely frustrated by Larson's quick pace and lack of detailed instruction.",1366502400,8,6170,4.77191328934967
5553060,4,B00B2BUZ7O,"This isn't my standard style of workout, but the reviews were good and I have been looking for more fusion style low impact workouts.  I was surprised how much I really like this.  In 30 minutes she really packs in a lot of exercises, I definitely work up a good sweat, and there is no impact at all.  I find the workout flies by, and it really works well for early morning workouts, as it's not too hard, but challenging. I like the mix of weights, kettlebells and non weighted moves.  I like Ivy, her personality and instruction is good.  I would definitely buy another workout from her.",1364947200,,589,4.416666666666667
5553061,5,B00B2BUZ7O,"This workout is great! I have been doing it for a couple of weeks now 3 times a week. The first time i did it it was hard to keep up because I didn't know the moves. She goes from one excercise right into another. I have never done a yoga class in my life and I found it to be really great! I would highly reccomend doing the warm up and the stretch afterwards. One time I was in the middle of excersising and I got an important phone call and I couldn't finish, my leg muscles were so sore for 2 days from not doing the final yoga stretch. I also bought the Clean Cuisine book with this DVD and I make a green smoothie after my workouts. They are fantastic! I have made a few changes of the amount of ingrediants to to suit my tastes. There is a lot of great info in the book. I will not be adapting everything in the book to my life but I have made a few easy changes. Having 3 kids to feed this would be a stretch for them. I have been doing Jillian's Shred DVD for the last 3 years and i got really bored with it and needed a change. This workout is great and I actually look forward to doing it after I drop my kids off at school! For this workout I use 4 lb weights and a 10 lb kettlebell, you will also need a sturdy chair & a yoga mat for this dvd.",1363737600,,1256,3.8160919540229883
5553062,5,B00B2BUZ7O,"I have been using this workout every other day for 5 weeks now, and I can tell a difference in my functional strength!  I like that the workout is quick paced and that it includes cardio, strength training, yoga and stretching.  Sometimes it's hard for me to hear Ivy, but I've done the workout enough now that I know what to do with each exercise.",1363651200,,348,4.338461538461538
5553063,5,B00B2BUZ7O,"This is the first workout DVD i've purchased that left me feeling like I could really accomplish this and was not dreading the next workout.  Today was my first time using this DVD and I cannot tell you the last time I sweat this much!  I feel energized and ready for the next workout.  I really like that the set and music was kept simple and REAL.  Most programs give me low back pain and have alot of high impact moves that put strain on my knees and back, but this fitness routine did not give me any joint pain.  The moves are fluid and engage the entire body all at once, without wearing you completely out; it really is a full body workout.  There is alot of inspiration from yoga and pilates, which I love also.  Thanks Ivy for a great workout!",1363564800,,752,4.216783216783217
5553064,5,B00B2BUZ7O,"I bought this directly from Ivy's website because it seemed to fit what I was looking for - 30min, total body, strength/cardio, and most of all low impact. I'm very happy I bought this as it accomplishes everything I was looking for. Plus I got a good sweat out of it. That's always a good thing!

Some caveats. The workout kind of moves from move to move, for example kettlebell to dumbbell to unweighted cardio moves with no apparent choreography so this might bother some people who like sequences that flow well together. I didn't mind this at all and in fact found the variety interesting. I don't think I'll be bored with this DVD as with some others where I know which moves will come after (I hate the moves that build on top of each other or too much take it from the top type sequences). I can see myself doing this one regularly.

And you will definitely see results if you use a sufficiently heavy weight. I only used 5 lbs and that made it an intermediate level workout so you can always lower or increase the weight to fit your fitness level. There's no tricky moves - all very simple, easy to learn - like I said no choreography.",1360108800,2,1144,4.366197183098592

A lot of workouts are SO intense they're overwhelming and I get discouraged thinking ""I'll never be able to do that!!""  Not with this one, it is very intense, but at the same time doable. I love that there's nothing in this workout that makes my knees hurt.  It's no impact, but high intensity.  LOVE it!",1360022400,7,533,4.247524752475248

I finally have found a workout that I really know that I can do all the time and not get bored! Ivy is so inspiring and very motivating! I was sore, in a god way after the first workout but also felt very energized! Thank you, Ivy for the Clean Cuisine Book and the DVD. These are both truly Life Transforming tools for so many of us and very unique!

8561353,3,B00B2BUZ7O,"I wanted to like this one, but there are a lot of flaws with it, and there are better DVDs out there.

I agree with what other two and three star reviews have said:  Ivy is sincere in her delivery, but her cuing isn't the best; it's a bit disjointed with it's get up, get down, pick up weights, set down weights, etc.; it's a nice workout for 30 minutes, but there are weaknesses in it that will make me turn to other DVDs in the future.  Ivy sometimes shows modifications, but not always.  Her pacing can be a bit frantic, but if you do this DVD multiple times, you'll probably get into the rhythm.

Music:  Eh, it's okay. Not the best, not the worst.

Set:  It's a very pleasing set, with nice lighting that's bright but not too bright.  The floor is a light wood floor, again, pleasing. There are light blues and greens in the set, with light blue Lululemon mats being used by the exercisers.  The white curtains and objects in the background are nice, not stark

Exercise:  The whirlybird arm movements are lame. I can't imagine they get the heart rate up, as she said. Also, she shows upright rows, which can be really bad for people with shoulder injuries. She jumps into the warmup, but it's a nice warmup. Her cool-down stretching segment with yoga moves is also nice.

I would recommend this to someone who is familiar enough with exercise to modify if needed. I wouldn't recommend this to beginning exercisers because some of the moves need modification if you have shoulder, hip or knee issues.  Also, some of the moves could tweak your back if you don't know much about exercising with weights.  Intermediate and advanced exercisers might like it for a light day.

I like that Ivy shared her health history. It makes her more relateable.

If she makes another DVD, I would try it.",1463529600,,1792,4.498452012383901
8561354,4,B00B2BUZ7O,"A mix of yoga, pilates and active movements, this is a surprisingly good workout despite the ""no impact"" title. This is one of those DVDs that I can convince myself to do even if I don't feel like working out. For one thing, you don't have to wear shoes or have much of anything except a yoga mat and a kettlebell; it starts with a good warm-up and the motions are easy to master but do provide a good full-body stretch and strengthen session. My only negative is that the yoga portion at the end feels rushed; I usually do it at my own pace, though.",1453075200,,550,4.19811320754717
8561355,3,B00B2BUZ7O,"Ivy is like-able and seems knowledgeable, but she whips through this workout, and even after doing it many times, it's still too fast a pace for my liking.  I get that she was trying to make it a 30 minute workout (which, by the way, it isn't if you include the warm up and cool down), but you just want to tell her to take a breath.  It's not the best cuing.  If she weren't so frantic, I think she'd have done a better job leading the workout.",1450310400,,445,4.034090909090909
8561356,4,B00B2BUZ7O,"This is probably not for everyone, but it's perfect for someone like me, who at 43 is just returning to this kind of exercise after a long hiatus and has a handful of physical limitations. Also, if you live in an apartment with downstairs neighbors and so can't jump around a lot (as I did when I bought this), this is great. I've got a background in yoga and pilates, so some of the moves here are familiar and I know how to do them right.  I thought I was in decent shape (lots of biking and walking over the last years) but I struggled to keep up with this video the first few times I did it. Now, after doing it sporadically for a few months and regularly (3 times a week) for a month or so, I'm already starting to see some little changes in my body. I'm already more flexible, feel a bit firmer in my core, am starting to see a bit more definition in my abs, and I'm  a little bit stronger ( I was able to increase the dumbbell and the kettlebell weights). I like to do this in the morning, because I feel so good afterwards and the feelings lasts all day.

I feel like this video will work for me for a while, because I can keep increasing the weights as I get stronger. And there are always ways to make bodyweight exercise more intense. Though I also feel like I'm using this video to get fit, and once I am feeling more fit I'll probably move on to something more intense. Doing the kettlebell exercises here has me interested in more advanced kettlebell work, so this might be the gateway to that.

For newer exercisers or people without experience with yoga/pilates: There's not a lot of instruction on proper form or technique, or breathing, so I don't think (as others have said) that it's great for people without some background in some of the styles of movements she's doing.  I don't think you're likely to injure yourself, but you may not get the most out of some of the postures and movements. Also, there's a fair amount of shoulder work here. If you have shoulder issues, you  might need to make some substitutions.",1449014400,,2037,4.319371727748691

I ordered this DVD because I was looking for something that was low impact.  I do the video 2 to 3 times a week and it has really helped me tone up. The exercises reach muscles I haven't used in quite a while.  :)  I know some people don't like that she jumps from activity to activity but I actually really like that.

Its fabulous because its not too easy, not too hard. Doable. You'll feel it the next day, but you feel good. I have done the 30 minute main workout and the yoga cool down. I Love them both. I haven't done the warm up. I prefer to do my own. She does move fast, but I like that. Once you've done the DVD a few times you don't need instructions anymore. She doesn't go on and on or yell at you. She's likeable. Its fast becoming one of my favorite workout DVDs, and I've done a lot of them;-)",1419206400,,732,3.945945945945946
8561360,2,B00B2BUZ7O,"I ordered this DVD after reading about Ivy's inspirational spirit and the way she faced her health challenges. I also liked the fact that this was a barefoot workout and designed to be low-impact and easy on the joints.

With her sweet demeanor, Ivy seems like the girl next door. And her physique is admirable - toned and muscular. But, her teaching style didn't click with me.

I used to teach pilates and fitness classes, so I understand and appreciate the effort it takes to choreograph routines for class. However, I felt that this workout jumped from one type of exercise to another without any type of natural flow. For instance, we were doing planks on a mat and then suddenly we were jumping up and doing boxing moves.

I also prefer workouts without too many different types of equipment, and for this one you need a mat, a set of weights, a kettlebell and a chair. Again, constantly switching from one type of equipment to another seemed disjointed to me.

Because of all of the constant changing of positions and equipment, I felt distracted. I couldn't get in the zone, so I didn't feel like I got a good workout.

I did enjoy the cool down, though. It contained many yoga moves and was very fluid.

If you are looking for low-impact workouts that are fluid and challenging, check out anything from Jessica Smith. I always break a sweat whenever I do a workout of hers.",1402531200,4,1382,4.574898785425101

I've done the workout twice, and for a newbie like me, it is a bit difficult, but I found I can keep up with it about 80% of the time (I'm working on 100%!).  My body feels sore (in a good way) ALL OVER (abs, arms, legs, etc.).  Prior to this, I was doing about 40 minutes of resistance training and then 40 minutes on the elliptical.  This workout is 40 minutes total (including the warm up and stretching afterward), which saves me time overall, and DEFINITELY giving me a better workout than I was getting (as indicated by the sore muscles, and sweaty body!).  Plus you need very little equipment, and can pretty easily do it on the road (I travel quite a bit).

I also highly recommend the Clean Cuisine book.  Ivy and her husband back up all of their recommendations with solid science, and I've already dropped a few pounds.  Before this, I was doing a low-carb type diet, which did work to lose weight, but is clearly not as healthy as this program, plus it got boring, unlike the Clean Cuisine program.

I noticed some of the reviewers didn't like the ""disjointedness"" of the workout.  As Ivy explains in her book, ""mixing up"" the routine like this is key to having a successful workout regime, and makes for better fat burning and toning.  I can tell it's already working, and I really appreciate that the workout is completely low impact, because I have some hip and knee alignment issues.  Really there's nothing in the market like this that I'm aware of.  It is an awesome fitness DVD.",1400371200,,1691,4.416129032258064
