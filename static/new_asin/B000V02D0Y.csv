Two... You like comics, anime, and freaky s*** video production?  You must have this.

I am going to stop counting...
The most important reason for having this heirloom piece of TV history, Mad Phat Hip Hop stars (read the cred's fam')  creepy old Kung Fu films, trippy editing... AND most importantly.... CLASSIC HIP HOP!  The kind of music that only lives deep in the NYC H.H. web'iverse.  This s*** does not exist any more!  THE Voice and Music CAST IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!

This is a true collectible.  Buy it if you can.  It's worth more than what it is listed at!",1361923200,,712,4.6
8216084,3,B000V02D0Y,"I bought this dvd set because I watched a couple of episodes on MTV a couple of times but never really got to see the whole series. The TV series was hilarious to watch, I loved it so much that I decided to buy it to watch at home.

I liked a couple of the episodes like the ones where the old blind guy beats up all the younger people with his stick and how he trains his student in his karate style. The other episodes were not as good as the episodes with the old guy however and commercials are included on the DVD's like the ones that they put in movie theaters when your waiting for the previews before the movies. There are also a couple of music videos and movie previews included on the DVD's. I find this to be extremely annoying, I did not BUY DVD's to watch commercials, ads, and previews for other stuff. I do not care for the music videos, movie previews, or commercials that are included on the DVD's and feel they take away from the viewers enjoyment of the series.

There are also a couple of parts where they show you a couple mini episodes consisting of the main scenes from each episode but they don't include the full episodes until much later in the other DVD's, another waste of time, why would they show you all the main scenes for something before you watch it?

I gave it 3/5 stars, it had alot of potential but the way they set it up ruined what could have been a great comedy release.",1271203200,4,1412,4.202952029520295
8216085,4,B000V02D0Y,"Don't be tricked by the way they are spelling it, it's pronounced differently. A great series too watch. Kung fu, dubbed by rapper, flavored by gamers. A comical way of watching previous world renowned Martial Artist movies. Always a great hit at any party or even if you want to watch it yourself. It's 30 fun, packed in an episode. 2 episodes per DVD, and there's 5 of them. I discovered the series when it was running on MMUSA (now FUSE) and wanted to see it again. As said back when it ran they added on the DVD some commercials which was first kind of annoying (you can skip them over) but once watched having a little comical flashback of how bad games looked just like 4 years ago. The commercials feature Videogames, Anime, and Muic (full fledged rap videos from around the world). This is not for the true East or Westcoaster (and even the dirty south). You will see other sides of the world of rap.
If you like either one of these: Rap (Hip-Hop), Kung-Fu, Videogames then this is the series for you. If you don't like ANY of the above, don't buy the product. I just wish they would've had another season.",1237161600,2,1114,4.412621359223301
