8170963,5,B0009YVDBC,"Movies and television series about espionage tend to glamorize the intelligence profession.  ""The Sandbaggers"" is that rare television series that goes in the other direction.  The Sandbaggers are a special section within Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), run by Neil Burnside, who is himself a former sandbagger, and who spends his days wrestling the bureaucracy while nourishing a special relationship with his CIA counterpart.

Sandbaggers are used as problem solvers by the Foreign Office.  Burnside, who is haunted by the agents he's lost or seen killed, is often reluctant to commit his agents on some higher-up's whim or chance for promotion.  At the same time, he understands the zero sum nature of the intelligence business, and can be as ruthless as anyone if necessary.

The episodes are wonderfully entertaining and tense, as bureaucratic wrangles and double-dealing inside and outside the government are the order of the day.  Season One has seven well-done episodes, the cast is very solid, and the dialogue is first rate.  The show is also a time capsule of late 1970's fashion and technology.  Well recommended as good entertainment.",1524182400,,1160,5.329670329670329
