8500176,1,B006KJGNZQ,"My daughter begged for a Hello Kitty dvd after seeing one at her preschool.  I put her off for a long time, then got one called ""Hello Kitty eats her Vegetables.""  It wasn't too bad; bit preachy for my taste, and definitely made from the perspective of a different, more guilt-oriented culture.  So, after that one, I thought I'd try this one.  Lordy!  What a mistake!  I went online, researched, and discovered that there are several Hello Kitty dvds produced from a variety of makers.  They are all extremely different.  To my taste, this isn't fit to show a child.  It's sappy, stupid, and scary in really weird ways.  The animation is completely low-rent, unimaginative, and downright stupid.  The characters talk so fast and with such annoying voices, that it's how I imagine an acid-trip would be. I have banned it from my household.",1350604800,9,839,4.756944444444445
