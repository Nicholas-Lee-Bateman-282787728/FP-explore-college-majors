8600454,3,B00000FZMI,"The cast list for this performance includes Garbis Boyagian as Rigoletto, Alida Ferrarini as Gilda, Vincenzo Bello as The Duke of Mantua, Antonio Zerbini as Sparafucile, Franca Mattuicci as Maddelena, and Orazio Mori as  Monterone with Donato Renzetti conducting.  It is dated 1981 and under the  direction for television of Brian Large.  It is very interesting to see the  production in the Arena.  The singers are not household names and they do  their share of scooping and swooping, but all give committed performances  and the drama holds together darn well which is why I give it 3 stars, not  2.  Although the sleeve says 60 minutes, it is a complete performance  except that Bello does not take the Act 2 cabaletta Possente Amor.  However, there are not any noticible splices either.  In all, I enjoyed  this performance more than I expected.  But, don't expect Pavarotti - he is  not there!",963446400,4,899,4.8933333333333335
