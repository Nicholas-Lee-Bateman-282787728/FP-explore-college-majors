2631202,5,B000H8RVSO,"I've been enjoying yoga instructor Barbara Benagh's other recent DVD release, Yoga for Stress Relief, so I decided to take a look at this one as well.  This DVD, released by Body+Soul magazine, is intended for those new to yoga.  There are a total of 5 shorter (<30 minutes), targeted routines which provide detailed instruction in basic yoga postures.  These sequences allow the beginning yoga practitioner to build a solid foundation by learning proper alignment and taking the time to focus on form.  In the second part of the DVD, Barbara combines the targeted practices to form five extended routines.  These longer (30-70 minutes) practices utilize mostly the same footage (warm-up and relaxation sequences are added) to provide a more comprehensive, in-depth yoga experience.  Barbara uses a yoga mat and occasionally makes use of a blanket as well.

A breakdown of the DVD is listed below; I've first listed the main menu items and then have broken down the two submenus, ""Getting Started"" and ""As You Progress."" The times for each practice are given as they appear on-screen, but I've added adjusted times in parentheses based on my own review. I've also included brief summaries of the composition of each segment; these summaries are meant to provide an overview rather than to be all-inclusive.

Getting Started:  Targeted Routines
* Backbends, 10m (22.5)- locust, seated backbend/shoulder stretch, cobra, bow; slow but building intensity

* Strength and Balance, 20m (20.5) - teaches
""core strength breathing"" used with boat prep work, half boat, modified side plank, and plank pose; finish in child's pose
* Sun Salutations, 20m (22) - very slow flow; begins with 2 sun breaths, 2 half salutes, and then a total of only 2 rounds of sun salutations, the first more modified than the second

As You Progress:  Extended Routines
There are three new sequences included in the below practices.  The first is Breathing and Centering (12.5 minutes), which includes breathing deep and centering the mind while lying on your back, breathing in rhythm with pulling the knees in and out, and breathing during a simple lying twist (revolved stomach pose).  The second is a Restorative sequence 11.5 minutes) made up of three separate segments:  supported reclined cobbler's pose, upper back opener reclining over bolster, and legs up the wall pose.  Finally, there is a 5.5 closing Relaxation sequence.
* Basics:  Wonderful Place to Start, 70m (68.5) - Breathing and Centering (12.5), Standing Poses (22.5), Seated Hip Openers (28), and Relaxation (5.5)

* Rejuvenate:  When You Need to Catch Your Breath, 30m (30) - Breathing and Centering (12.5), Restorative (11.5), Relaxation (5.5)
* Quieting:  Great for the Evening, 55m (56) - Standing Poses (22.5), Seated Hip Openers (28), Relaxation (5.5)

Overall, this is an extremely well-done DVD.  Although it's definitely appropriate for those new to yoga, I'm not sure if I'd recommend it as a very first yoga video; because Barbara is practicing alone (on a beautiful beach at Half Moon Bay Resort in Antigua), she is unable to show modifications, although she certainly does offer plenty of suggestions for going at your own pace.  I am not new to yoga myself:  I started dabbling about 6 years ago, have been practicing regularly for the past 3, and would rate myself at about an intermediate level.  While Barbara's detailed teaching certainly provides me with an excellent opportunity to achieve a greater level of proficiency, I do find that the practices move a bit slow for where I am at present.  In addition, given that I usually have less than an hour at a time to devote to yoga, I'm not sure I'll get much use from the extended sequences.  Regardless, I can see myself mixing and matching to create my own practices, and thus I believe that most beginning and intermediate yogis will be able to find value in this excellent video.",1169424000,"1,402",4897,5.10288582183187
2631203,5,B000H8RVSO,"I am a little confused by the folks who say that there isn't enough instruction and that there are not enough cautions at the beginning of the program.  If you watch the first section, you get a clear overview of ways to focus, and the instructor says very clearly that as a beginner, a person should only challenge themselves as far as they feel a stretch, but that this should not be painful, and that beginners should not expect to be able to fully achieve the poses yet.  Furthermore, as you watch, she continually suggests modifications for beginners, and gives instructions that are so clear and explicit that yesterday I found myself altering the position of my big toe.  It is THAT clear.

I love the short workouts that isolate areas to strengthen as supplements to the longer workouts.  As a beginner, having those short chunks has really helped me, and with several weeks of this program, and doing the backbend segment every other day, I have noticed that my lower back doesn't hurt in the morning anymore.  I can't wait for the evening each day so that I can go home and do my yoga!  I tried taking yoga classes at my gym, and disliked how fast and advanced the programs were.  This really is perfect for beginners!",1168992000,975,1228,4.575342465753424
2631204,5,B000H8RVSO,"I received a few DVDs as gifts.  I had never done yoga before and this was a great introduction to getting started. The instruction was very clear, and I especially liked that I could do short routines or long routines.  Also the setting was very beautiful and added to the overall positive experience.",1168560000,35,302,4.679245283018868
2631205,4,B000H8RVSO,"As a yoga teacher, I'm always interested in videos/dvds to recommend to beginner students.  I borrowed this dvd from a friend and thought it was very useful and informative for a beginner.  The instruction is clear and very slow.  I especially liked how the practice was broken down into smaller sections so a practitioner can do as little or as much of the sequence as they like.  I would recommend this video to an absolute beginner or to some one who's looking for a very slow quiet home practice.

Enjoy & Namaste.",1166400000,110,518,4.586956521739131
2631206,5,B000H8RVSO,I absolutely love this DVD. I highly recommend it not just for beginners but for  anyone who enjoys yoga.  There are eight complete routines and they are just fabulous.  The instructions are so clear and the DVD was filmed in Antigua so it is just beautiful.,1166054400,30,258,4.565217391304348
2631207,5,B000H8RVSO,I had never done Yoga before and I was afraid to go to the gym and look like an idiot. I picked up this DVD and it is awesome.  There are a ton of workouts and I haven't even gotten to all the routines yet. I'm never going to get bored and I even think at some point I will do a class at the gym. Definitely a good one.,1163548800,440,319,3.557142857142857

2631216,1,B000H8RVSO,"I watched this tape for about 15 minutes and turned it off.  I purchased as it said for beginners but she seemed intent on showing her flexibility....something I couldn't even begin to do as a true beginner and found it discouraging rather than inspiring.  Seated, reaching around her back and grabbing her other thigh, to me, is not a beginners technique.  The first exercise she filmed, she had her back to the camera and it was difficult to even tell what she was doing.  Thank you.",1522195200,3,485,4.604651162790698

2631218,5,B000H8RVSO,"I've always been intimidated by yoga... until now!  The instructor made me feel totally comfortable and ""okay"" with a simply approach, wonderful breathing instructions with constant affirmation by my just beginning!!  I've never worked out a day in my life.  At 50+ years young I'm feeling stiff and with just three of the beginner sessions i could already feel my muscles loosening and back extending.  My knees and back are in bad shape so I ordered a 4"" gym mat to go under my yoga mat which helps also.  I also like this dvd because you can customize your workout before going into the more 60-70 minute advanced workouts.  This instructor tells you not to rush; sometimes it takes a year to really get the hang of it. Whew!  No pressure at all.  If you've never done yoga and want to get into shape while gaining strength, endurance, increased joint movement, etc I highly recommend this DVD!",1521417600,,897,4.6687898089171975

Having used the DVD several times a week for the past year, I can see my improvement, and can actually do some of the ""impossible"" ones, which is a great confidence builder.

It was also quite hard when you're in a pose like downward facing dog trying to crank your head back up to look at the TV to see what she's doing. Without a base knowledge of poses just listening to her describe what to do didn't quite cut it.",1490745600,4,532,3.889908256880734

2631305,5,B000H8RVSO,"My wife and I started doing yoga at home together after she spent New Years Day at the hospital ER with a very painful herniated disk.  We have been using this DVD and Barbara's other DVD for those over 50 and they're both excellent.  We are beginners and this has given us a solid foundation of the basics of yoga.  We like that there is a variety of different routines, and that several are just 20 or 25 minutes which is sometimes all the time we have.  I'm not always up for a one hour workout.  Barbara has a very pleasant voice and her instruction is good.  These have more a ""zen"" feel to them, which is something we love.
Since we started these two DVDs, we've been to an organized class and felt like we were prepared.

2631317,4,B000H8RVSO,"I did yoga a few years ago but fell out of practice. While I have the knowledge, I'm more out of shape and flexibility than I was when first did yoga. I think this is pretty good for beginners. Some of the moves I wouldn't call a beginners move, that said though it is OK not to push into that move. When getting into the move, if I could only go to the first step I would just hold it. The instructor may go further but the great thing about yoga is you can adjust to your level.

She does give a small intro for you to watch. I would watch it if you've never done yoga. Compared to other yoga videos (including youtube), she does give much more instruction on alignment.

I really like that she has several different length if videos. If I'm in the mood to workout for an hr or more I can. If I'm tired and don't have time, there are short 20 minute videos I can do.

The moves she does go over have way different names than I'm used to. I like that she uses English names versus the traditional names (They've always confused me).

Something to remember is it takes time to get to the video version. I could barely hold some stances when I first began, but they have gotten easier with time and patience. I may be young but I have crappy joints from injuries. I also have a desk job that does the help. Work at your level.

Buying a block and strap is very helpful. You can also use a military belt if you don't have too much money. That's what I used before I had the money to get a strap.",1485907200,5,1493,4.0646258503401365

Just enough that I feel wonderful and stretched out after following the beginner segments. I have not even ventured to the more advanced tracks, I am so happy with the beginner ones.
The instructions are very clear, and if you put a full length mirror in the room where you practice, you can easily see how your pose looks  compared to the DVD and adjust accordingly.

You would think someone claiming to teach beginners would realize that you need to explain things better, especially when the viewer isn't consistently staring at the screen.

If you are intermediate to advanced, I probably not recommend this because of exactly what I just said. When you already know how to do the poses, you don't want to spend a lot of time hearing the instructor go on and on about foot placement and degrees and angles.

2631395,5,B000H8RVSO,"I have exercised since I was 29 years old, faithfully. I've done everything you can imagine. At 57 my body was screaming, ""Enough with the jumping and running already!"" I wanted a Yoga DVD with a woman about my age and found Barbara! Outstanding DVD. I love performing slow moves with her and wow, I am taller when I walk and am toned. I have been using this one DVD for almost six months and won't be ready, as she mentions on the DVD, for another until probably a year of which I'm only buying Barbara Benagh's DVDs.",1465603200,2,518,4.295918367346939
2631396,3,B000H8RVSO,"I wanted a DVD that was kind of like going to yoga class at the gym, but at home. This DVD is not really like that. This is like slow, on the beach, choppy.. not really what I was looking for.",1465516800,,192,3.707317073170732

2631398,3,B000H8RVSO,"Admittedly I've only done 2 of the routines and give FIVE STARS for the de-stressing 30 minute routine.  I dropped off 2 stars because I did the standing poses one and managed to strain my calf muscle.  The instructor encourages you to stretch and twist more and more without too many cautionary warnings for us true beginners.  I think this would be a great DVD to get if you've been to yoga classes and now want to do it yourself.  But, if you are a real newbie, never having done it, being shown a stretch where the woman can wrap her arm behind her back to grab her thigh is not true beginner material.  It was a little too ambitious.  Once healed, I'll try some of the other routines and very much will do the de-stressing one but I have 3-4 weeks in an air cast to heal this calf tear (which. to be fair, the doctor said could have happened while walking due to a tight Achilles, although I've done a LOT of walking and had no issue....).  I've done other work out DVDs and this is the first injury.",1465084800,4,1005,4.230366492146596

2631416,1,B000H8RVSO,"I just watched the brief video sample of this DVD; it's not for beginners.  First, there's a complete forward bend which is an intermediate pose and which must be completely avoided by anyone with a disc problem, followed by a pose held for more than 30 seconds which could result in serious injury to the knees of anyone who isn't extremely flexible.  This is a common problem with supposedly ""beginner"" DVDs; it's a beginner DVD for teachers who have been doing yoga for years, but not for many others.  Even the pose on the cover of the DVD isn't a beginner pose except for those who are very flexible.

The backdrop of film location is beautiful. The woman explaining and demonstrating the yoga poses has a calming presence.

I know I'm getting a great workout based on how I feel the following day with sore muscles, but I don't feel like I'm working out while following this. I feel calm and like I got a great stretch.

Not a bad yoga dvd, but you have to watch the whole routine before you do it with her, which doubles the time it takes.

After I did a little more with yoga that I was able to keep up a little better with this video. It is well worth the purchase still and is a great starting point even if you learn one and then pause to practice that one.

I have only done a couple of the sections, but have found it to be extremely relaxing.  It is a lot of stretching and teaching yourself to relax through breathing techniques.  It is great for lowering blood pressure after a very trying shift at work.  Clears your mind and relaxes your body so you can let go of your day and sleep.",1443484800,2,440,4.329268292682927

2631508,5,B000H8RVSO,"I am starting to practice yoga as a 40something. I took a summer yoga class in college and tried to follow a dvd for beginners a few years ago to get back into it, but that only had one long routine on it and I found it difficult to fit it into my busy schedule. The Barbara Benagh DVD has annoying loud music on the ""menu"" page, but since I fast forward to that and then click on the routine I want it is not an issue (I noticed some people complaining about the music and was concerned it would be an issue on the routines, but it is not). I find her example and description of how to move through the poses easy to follow, including instructions for what to do when you are less flexible (something I sadly need!).

So far I have done all the Getting Started routines at least once; the longer routines I am not quite ready to do. The getting started routines are mostly about 20 minutes, one is 10 minutes, and some are 30. This is a good length for someone coming to yoga and needing to build flexibility and strength, plus, it fits into my crazy schedule well. The first two routines are a series of poses edited together with a pan to the ocean in between, but the bulk of the Getting Started section has videos that were shot and edited together to move from one pose to the other with guidance.

It might seem fast at first, but just persist and you will get quicker and smoother at following from pose to pose. This is a good beginner's DVD set.",1442188800,5,1455,4.192857142857143

I admit that I am out of shape at the moment, but I want to tell you that this is a GOOD video. She has beginner routines and advanced routines. I decided to start at the beginning and do them in order. The first two routines were pretty much about stretching and relaxing. I fell asleep after the first one because I was so relaxed. Then came the standing poses. I had to do it three times before I could do it all the way through - and then the next day I was sore. It's really good. She talks you through each move, and it goes slowly, so that you know you're doing it right. I feel like I made a really good choice for building a good yoga foundation. I haven't had a chance the last few days to continue, but I feel myself looking forward to each routine. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to start off slow and really learn it.",1437523200,19,986,4.140625

She would get into a decent pose and then ""here we go"" back to downward dog.  I was afraid of the prolonged head below the heart pose.

A lot of other videos were difficult to follow and didn't allow time to figure out what you were doing, or didn't explain what it was, so I had to keep looking at the TV to make sure I understood what the next position really was.

Very good cuing from the teacher.",1394323200,,207,4.421052631578948
2631804,2,B000H8RVSO,Really not for beginners - she moved to quickly - trying to watch and do the exercise at the same time was difficult.  I have other yoga tapes I enjoy much more.,1394323200,,161,4.03125

2631808,4,B000H8RVSO,"I think I did it once and I enjoyed it, but haven't been disciplined to do it on a regular basis.  Would like to, though, because I think it will help me with my back and neck discomfort.",1394323200,,187,3.9210526315789473
2631809,5,B000H8RVSO,I am very pleased with this DVD. I bought it because my doctor wants me doing yoga to strengthen my back. A family member recommended it to me.,1394236800,,143,4.142857142857143
2631810,5,B000H8RVSO,Used this frequently before switching to Pilates. It is an excellent routine and just perfect time wise and challenge wise. I still use it from time to time but find Pilates more suitable for me.,1394150400,,195,4.6
2631811,5,B000H8RVSO,"This is actually a great value for the money - I've only worked through the first two routines, and I feel like it's the perfect intro to yoga. I'm getting a workout, and learning breathing techniques, but don't feel overwhelmed.",1394064000,,229,4.75
2631812,4,B000H8RVSO,"This is a good yoga DVD for starters. I enjoy it, and it leaves you feeling relaxed afterwards. I do recommend purchasing a yoga matt to go along with this.",1393804800,,156,4.233333333333333

2631816,4,B000H8RVSO,"I like the yoga cd,but i haven't used it alot,but i like the way she encourages you to ease into the moves,not so much focus on getting the move just right as she is with the breathing and being comfortable,i,m still  learning and have to go slow,but i would reccomend",1392681600,,268,4.36
2631817,5,B000H8RVSO,A great way to start or end your day. Barbara explains everything very well and has some great exercises.. Glad I bought it.,1392681600,,124,4.434782608695652

2631820,5,B000H8RVSO,"I just decided to take up yoga and start at home so I don't completely embarrass myself in a studio (just yet!)

This DVD is really easy to follow, well timed out, and has great instructions! It challenges me and also helps me relax. After I work on the segments on this DVD, I'll have to buy some of Barbara's other ones!",1392422400,,322,4.193548387096774

2631822,5,B000H8RVSO,"I have never tried yoga before, but have always wanted to. I have a joint disorder and I was always scared to take a class with people watching me having to make modifications. I am so glad I got this DVD, not only because I can do it at home, but because the moves are very easy for me to modify. I also love how she emphasizes that yoga is not just about the pose, it is about your breathing and focus. Hearing that makes me feel okay with the fact that I can't do all the poses the way they are demonstrated. After my first time trying it, I did the ""End of Day"" routine. It was more relaxing than Valium! I highly recommend this to anyone interested in starting yoga.",1392076800,,671,4.090909090909091
2631823,5,B000H8RVSO,Oh what a great DVD I have another yoga dvd but this one is so much better not only does it have more segments but she explains the postures so well especially for someone like me who is not that proficient at it and her voice is so calming and soothing.,1391817600,,254,4.0
2631824,5,B000H8RVSO,"The instructor goes slow, explains thing well, and I am enjoying it very much.  I was  surprised that I would love doing this so much.  I can already see some results, each time I do the program, It is easier.  Thank you so much.",1391817600,,229,4.136363636363637
2631825,4,B000H8RVSO,This was a great place for me to start my Yoga experience. It was easy to follow and I saw almost immediate results.,1391817600,,116,4.086956521739131
2631826,5,B000H8RVSO,Many practice sessions and easy to follow.  Picked a different one of seven each day for the whole month of January.  And There are advanced sessions I will try in a few months.  Very happy with the video and the work I've been able to do.,1391212800,,239,4.1521739130434785
2631827,5,B000H8RVSO,"I really like the way that the routines are arranged. There are wake up routines, wind down routines and longer routines for when you have improved. If you have ever taken a dance class this DVD will not be hard to follow. If you have never done any type of movement class this video may not be for you.",1391212800,,303,4.1525423728813555
2631828,5,B000H8RVSO,This is a great DVD for beginners. There are many routines some including a little more advanced routines for as you progress. It is also nice that they all vary in length from 10 min hip openers to 70 min routines. They can be done alone or put together in any way you wish to create new routines. This keeps the video from getting old or boring fast. Also the instructors voice is not annoying as some others can be and the relaxing ocean setting is great. The instructor is easy to follow. I highly recommend this DVD. I will be looking for others by Barbara Benagh.,1391040000,2,569,4.327102803738318

2631830,5,B000H8RVSO,"This is just the type of DVD I needed to learn the basic poses (before attempting to do it in a group setting). The instructor moves through each pose slowly, so I am easily able to keep up. I just wish the video incorporated the use of yoga tools (i.e., yoga bricks, strap, etc) to show pose variations that can be substituted until a person becomes more advanced.",1390953600,,365,4.382352941176471
2631831,2,B000H8RVSO,"The dvd itself would be great if it didn't constantly frezze or just skip ahead all of a sudden, the material is excellent though if I could follow I would give a higher rating.",1390435200,,177,4.235294117647059
2631832,3,B000H8RVSO,"I've taken a few yoga classes.  I usually don't go back, because I'm not flexible enough (five back surgeries) to keep up with the class and the teachers don't seem to want to modify anything.  So I thought I'd try this.

It's not bad.  I enjoyed the breathing techniques and the instructor takes the right amount of time on each pose which seems to be a complaint among many yoga dvds.  Still though, some of the poses are impossible for beginners.  I would like to see an instructor actually working with an inflexible person to show what the modified poses really look like.  On a few of them, I just sat and watched because I couldn't do them and didn't know how to modify and still be in good form.",1390348800,2,703,4.361538461538461
2631833,1,B000H8RVSO,"This is so slow and so boring. This isn't for beginners, this is for someone who needs a guided meditation.
I've taken many beginners yoga classes and they move at a way faster pace.
The ladies voice just lingers... which makes it even worse. Couldn't relax into the positions... her voice was
so annoying.
Wouldn't recommend.
Course, I've yet to find a yoga video I would.
I've tried them all. And I'm beginning to think the only way to get a great yoga experience is by going to a studio.",1390262400,,490,4.455555555555556
2631834,5,B000H8RVSO,"My wife and I have little to no yoga experience.

The videos are clear and well produced. You can tell the instructor has a lot of experience as she will make a comment during a position and her advice will be super relevant.

Are we doing the poses 100% correctly, probably not. For our purposes being 90% for $8 instead of $50 a class is a great place to start.

Also, the first intro is a light stretch/meditation and is really relaxing.",1390262400,,440,4.341463414634147
2631835,5,B000H8RVSO,"I checked the reviews on this DVD and I felt that this would be a great way to start doing yoga. The reviews were right. I have used this DVD over and over and it is great! The DVD was still in its package and I had no problems using it on my laptop while I was in school.
Even though it's been over a year since I started using this video, I still use a specific yoga pose to help with my back pain. This is truly an amazing video. I would even recommend this to an expert.",1389830400,,474,3.797979797979798
2631836,4,B000H8RVSO,Great yoga choices for beginners and those with limited mobility to start.  Happy to say that our family members love it!,1389830400,,121,4.761904761904762
2631837,5,B000H8RVSO,"This DVD begins with a menu of several different routines, including an entire section of short beginner mini routines. They are labeled according to the types of exercises they contain. The instructor's voice is soothing and the routines move slowly enough to follow easily. I am usually sore the next day, but it's a more gentle soreness than a hit-by-a-truck pain. (I prefer the slower, more soothing routines, though, so another participant's experience may differ.)

The end-of-day-unwind types of routines are excellent for evening use and leave me feeling refreshed and relaxed. The number of routines on the DVD make this a great investment because it's easy to practice a variety of routines each week. I'm really happy with this purchase and recommend this DVD to anyone interested in trying yoga. I've seen great success in reducing hip, neck and low back pain due to regular yoga practice.",1389744000,,901,5.087837837837838

This was perfect. Some of the other yoga DVDs were better at showing you what the basic poses were but this one is the best at actually providing routines for a beginner to practice yoga to. I especially like that there's more than one routine so that you can either do one per day or mix and match a variety.
If you're primarily looking for a weight loss yoga DVD, this probably isn't for you. Like others have said, the instructor does go slowly. That's nice for learning and stress relief but not for burning calories. But, if you're looking to ease into a yoga practice, this is almost as good as taking a beginner's class at a studio.",1385510400,5,800,4.167741935483871

What I love about this DVD is that Barbara is fantastic about telling you the various ways you can do a pose depending on your level of ability.  If I can't turn all the way, or get my head to the ground she is great at providing and explaining the alternative approaches that work better for me.  Also, after following her guidance to relax specific muscle groups, and then immediately experiencing the result she describes make me feel confident in her knowledge, and the fact that my chances of injury are decreased.

LOTS on this DVD!!!  great to have in the collection.",1381536000,,392,3.9240506329113924
2631881,1,B000H8RVSO,Pretty annoyed that I couldn't even watch the DVD as it would work in Australia. Why not put a warning up before purchase. I then had to go through the whole process of selecting and waiting for delivery of another product. And what a waste. Brand new DVD in the trash.,1381363200,,269,4.294117647058823

2631883,5,B000H8RVSO,"I am 77 years old and have been a yoga student for many years.  However, I was suffering from severe sciatica when I bought this DVD.  I found it very helpful for my general health.
What I like about it:
First, there are short routines focusing on general areas, such as ""Sun Salutations"" or ""Seated Hip Openers"".  Beginners start with these shorter routines, then can go on to various longer routines.
Second, Barbara Benagh gives variations to work with, depending upon your strength and flexibility.
Third, she is slow and walks you through the poses making suggestions as she goes along.
Fourth, I feel this is an excellent DVD for beginning students AND older students.

I highly recommend this DVD.",1381104000,4,704,4.841666666666667

2631885,5,B000H8RVSO,I always wanted to get into yoga just never had the motivation. I saw this DVD and decided what the hell in gonna order it because it was cheap. Well I love it,1380672000,,159,3.8484848484848486
2631886,5,B000H8RVSO,"Until this video, my first and only experience with yoga had been the P90X yoga workout. Talk about jumping into the deep end! After leaving that series on the shelf for over a year, I decided to start over and approach yoga the right way by beginning with the basics. This video is PERFECT. As other reviewers have described, there are short targeted segments (10-30 min) in which one can learn and practice various poses, including correct positions, postures, alignment, breathing, etc., and longer workout segments (30+ min) that combine the basics and kick it up a notch. The instructor, Barbara Benagh, has a calm, relaxed voice and provides instruction that is easy to follow. She also provides various ways to do each pose depending on one's level of flexibility. After three weeks of practicing the targeted segments three or four times per week, I already feel improvement in my flexibility and strength, which demonstrates that even beginners can experience the benefits of yoga -- one does not have to be advanced to notice a positive difference. I am excited to progress through the DVD and move on to the ""next level""!",1380585600,,1132,4.901041666666667

I need a solid 60-90 minutes of yoga, not 60 minutes of lying down and stretching. Also, this really doesn't cut it compared to the awesome tutorials I found in Youtube.

2631898,1,B000H8RVSO,"I bought this thinking it would be a great product to get back into yoga slowly. I'm not super-old, but old enough I can't just jump right in. I will give this DVD credit for that--there is absolutely NO jumping in. However, this is glorified, very slow, pretty worthless stretching. I can do that without a guided video. Try another beginning one if you want to get back into Yoga or pick it up. This is only good if you are genuinely unable to even so much as tied your shoelaces",1378339200,7,481,4.2967032967032965

2631903,5,B000H8RVSO,This is a great DVD for those just starting out.  Your body needs time to adjust to muscle usage.  It also has a basic beginners and then a step up from that.  Good video.  I recommend this video to those who aspire to begin Yoga!,1377475200,,230,4.044444444444444

I started looking on Amazon for yoga dvd's so I could do Yoga in the comfort of my home and came across this one. I find the instuctor is very calming and explains the moves very well along with a demonstration. There is alot on this DVD I was amazed. I'm glad I chose it. You won't do the whole DVD at one shot it's just to much.
I love how the DVD is set up by segments. It's very helpful in the fact you can choose what mood you're in and how much you want to stretch or do more of a relaxation type thing. It definately has alot of variety. Excellent DVD for the one who wants to try Yoga for the first time ......or like me who just would like to enjoy at home.",1373414400,3,742,3.8562091503267975

Totally convienant! This film has me wanting to do Yoga more often because the workouts are timed and they vary so I know I have this much time to do this part and I'm not so hesitant to do it because of time constraint. Customers should know that it doesn't matter how far advanced or not far advanced you are in Yoga, this dvd is for you.

I think that being 25, maybe it is more for an older agegroup, and i would say that it is definately more of a relaxation yoga, than a yoga for workinging out. I definately appreciate the soothingness of Barbara Benagh's voice and the slow steady movements, but it just wasn't for me.

(It's also much better than one of the video-based yoga apps I have on my iPhone.)  Barbara Benagh is a great teacher who patiently walks you through each movement, explaining what to do based on your level of flexibility.  At first it seems deceptively simple, but many of the routines can be quite challenging.  I also appreciate the modular format of the DVD, where the longer routines combine the shorter ones that you work on first.  The shorter routines are also perfect for when I am pressed for time.

I did feel better, and will continue to use this. It is a little weirdly formatted though. It's like they taped a bunch of different poses, then added them together to make a sequence, so it threw me off a few times. I didn't always know what position to start in, or how to properly move into another position because it was cut off on some parts. I got used to it after the second time, and by the third and fourth times, it didn't bother me anymore.",1366243200,,624,4.208333333333333

This is not an insult; I simply felt that I (late 20s) was not the target audience for this video. The quality of the product itself is fine, it just was not a good fit for me at all.

I took a yoga class once with a friend of mine who does yoga all the time & I was completely lost & in a ton of pain after. This video is slower, she encourages you to go at your own pace. It's also very relaxing & great for unwinding at the end of the day. I would recommend doing it in a quiet environment, in my case after my toddler is sleeping! :)",1365638400,,453,3.778947368421053

I found the instructor's introduction at the beginning very useful for getting oriented, and her careful explanation of the poses, positioning and breathing throughout were clear and easy to follow. I have been using the DVD everyday for about three weeks, now, and I love how slow this is. I have plenty of time to find the pose and settle in, getting deeper and more comfortable before moving on. The bite-sized chunks of poses that make up the first half of the DVD are puh-lenty for a beginner like me to use to get started. I'm looking forward to taking on the more complex routines that make up the second half of the course. The instructor's voice is very pleasant, and you sure can't beat the venue. I'm very glad I found this!",1363737600,3,804,4.590277777777778

2631970,3,B000H8RVSO,This video is very intent on perfecting positioning of yoga poses. It places a lot of emphasis on getting your body in the correct alignment. I think for someone beginning it is good if you are most interested in learning to do the positions perfectly and not just to pop in a DVD to have a relaxing yoga workout. It would take a few times just watching and not practicing yoga with this video before you would be able to do the moves with her.,1363392000,,444,4.235294117647059

I really enjoy yoga and haven't been able to find a class or tv show to follow along with.  My son got me this for Christmas and it's the best present I've gotten in a long time.  The scenary is beautiful, the instructor narrates over her routine and is very clear about the moves you're doing, how to modify and always reminds you about your breathing.  There are various routines within this DVD, you can do as many or as few as you'd like.  You can pick your own routine and then when you get better - she has a few more challenging routines to try.  You work at your own pace - she's not a fanatic about form and focuses more on your ability to do the moves to get the most out of it.  I'm already more flexible and that is exactly what I was hoping for.  A really great DVD!",1362960000,2,998,4.108247422680412

I have made it through the introduction, interviews and five of the routines so far, and am pleased with the voice and sound quality and how the steps are demonstrated.  My only difficulty is in transitioning between steps quickly enough.  That will become easier as I become more familiar with the routines.  I think it is important to point out that some of the steps, though simple, are hard to do initially especially if flexibility is an issue.  I  found it helpful to simply watch the routines first to get a better understanding of what to expect.",1362182400,,722,4.515384615384615

This DVD takes you through most of the classical yoga poses one by one, with Barbara, the instructor demonstrating them in their ideal form, allowing you to learn to do them the right way instead of hurriedly copying what your neighbor is doing when taking a yoga class. The instructor has a very calm, serene approach, and the oceanside setting certainly augments that serenity!

I WAS WRONG!! This DVD broke me down like and ice cube in hot water.  Yoga is hard, yoga is very hard & did I mention yoga is hard.

My flexibility begins and ends at being able to reach behind my head to toss a handful of change into the basket at the toll booth.  The thought of yoga brings to mind bored, soy latte-sipping, tofu-eating women sitting around a loft studio in the trendy part of town, unrolling mats onto a hardwood floor before practicing their Downward Dog.

Whatever that is.

Yoga is supposed to promote health, flexibility, circulation, longevity, sex life, memory and cooking skills.  Heck, it probably even makes you smell better, I don't know.  But my wife does.  She swears by it and she tells me that this video is exactly what she was looking for, and getting it made her extremely happy.  And when mama's happy, everyone's happy.

2632025,4,B000H8RVSO,"I am not one of those people who want to ""breathe from my heart"", and this video spokesperson definitely loves that.  But what she does is to walk you slowly through basic yoga.  She helps you to understand that more isn't necessarily better and she helps you to improve.  I'm really happy with this video, her language, the way she shows you the best way to move on and the way she seems to know how to correct you even if she cannot see you.  I have tried all the routines and I appreciate all that she does.",1353024000,7,510,4.173469387755102

I have had Barbara's DVD for about six months now, and now that my library is larger, I can TRULY appreciate how superior her instruction is for complete beginners. Her voice is very soothing and the instrucion is very detailed and constant - you're always correcting your form. Poses are held for minutes at a time, which allows you to truly correct yourself. This is also what distinguishes this DVD from others - they rush you through poses a bit too quickly, and for a beginner it's a huge disservice. No matter how many other DVDs I try, I keep coming back to this one to remind myself how to do things correctly.",1353024000,,699,4.46875

2632031,4,B000H8RVSO,"For the price I paid (less than $9) it's a great value. I have taken around 10 classes along with a 2-day weekend class going over yoga basics and several hours worth of actual yoga with some lecture material and journals on the experience, information, physical activity history, stress level, etc. This makes for a great supplement but does not take the place of a good class. I personally cannot do all of the poses and so like a couple of different yoga instructors I had suggested, do what you can and focus on the breath. For some poses that were just painful due to an arm injury I went back to child's pose (you could use any relaxing pose and focus on breath and feeling your body) so it was still useful. I felt there was definitely enough time to get into the pose for someone who is at an inflexible starting point. There were also modifications mentioned and shown for as you advance or modifications to make the pose more comfortable.

Good value but unless you're new to yoga, it seems like you may get bored. However, it is for beginners and as such it is very appropriate and does the job.",1350259200,,1106,4.421568627450981

But if you want to properly learn yoga in the privacy of your own home and have enough routines to actually feel it in the morning, this is the video for you. It's slow enough for the newbie to keep up with the poses properly - focusing on your breath and your alignment. I've participated in a variety of yoga classes and watched many videos. To me, this is the best one for anyone new to Yoga or to anyone returning to Yoga. I love the instructor's voice and the filming location is amazing. I use this every day instead of lifting weights or doing traditional muscle toning exercises. In addition to running or walking 30 minutes every day, this will definitely help you lose weight while creating definition as well as improve balance of body and mind. However, if you are looking for something more challenging, then look into Vinyasa Flow DVDs. But if you've never done yoga, this is definitely your first stop.",1350172800,2,1001,4.535911602209945

I am also on the road 90 percent of the year so even if I did have access, I would be a very poor class attending person. I play a lot of sports and am a biker and runner but felt a need to exercise in a different way - something to supplement my rather harsh physical activities.

After reading the many fine reviews on this tape and searching and searching and reading and reading, I took a chance and bought this tape. I must say that I have been delighted. As a beginner I did not want to hurt myself and I wanted to learn everything right. This tape has done the job for me.

I suppose the most important thing though is that this product has given me a very strong basic foundation on which to build. I have now purchased additional and more advanced DVDs and I have found that I am quite able to absorb and perform so much better than had I not used this one to begin with.

Great to do with young kids (my son loves it) and I almost fell asleep after the 1st portion it most definately does relax.

2632058,5,B000H8RVSO,In February I started very seriously doing Yoga and Pilates and am surprised how well this time around I am enjoying it and am able to perform all the moves. This DVD is very well done and has lots of workouts so it is great value for the money as well as a wonderful introduction to Yoga by a wonderful calm and very soothing voiced instructor.  The background is a beautiful beach scene with the soothing sounds of the sea and waves.  This is great for the mind and body and after doing research I am surprised that Yoga is so beneficial to the mind and body and now I am seeing and feeling the difference.  I am surprisingly much more toned in places that were hard to reach before as in inner thighs and just under the butt etc.  I have always exercised but the yoga seems to streamline my bodys instead of bulk it and I like this very much.  I feel very calm and not much upsets me and I am happier so these things seem much more pronounced lately so I figure that it is the yoga. Barbara lets us know that we are not expected to be able to do all the moves and may need to modify so I don't understand people say she does not give good instructions because she does and this is a very well done dvd.

2632060,5,B000H8RVSO,"Having never had a Yoga class in my life and having never seen, much less bought a Yoga tape or DVD in my life I began my search.  Yogo was recommended to my by my physicians and physical therapists some time ago and after much putting it off, decided to do something about it.  One of the DVDs recommend to me was the one being reviewed here.  You can imagine my surprise and absolute confusion when I read the many reviews here.  Some said it was not for the beginner, others said it was for the beginner. Some said it was too fast, others too slow.  Some said the instructions were great while other said they were horrid...and on and on and on and on.  It was like three or four different programs were being discussed.

Well I read the review here by Beth Cholette.  This reviewer has never led me astray before so I figured that I would go ahead and give it a shot based on her extremely detailed review and description of the product.  Reading her words made the DVD sound precisely what I was looking for.  It was.

Thank you Beth!

I am an older male with hip, back and neck problems which have not responded to injections, physical therapy or medications.  This is horrid as I had reached a point where the pain and stiffness was interfering with my life.  I lead a rather active life for my age and I am not inclined to change my living habits all that much as I pretty well enjoy my life the way it is...or was, in this case.

I have been working with this program for four weeks now and I can already tell a difference in my movements and the pain is becoming less and less as each day goes by.  I found this type to be absolutely perfect for my needs.  I found the instructions to be extremely specific and had no problems following them.

Now after almost seven decades there is no way in the world I could perform all of the positions described in this DVD right from the start.  To be honest, I would have hurt myself had I tried.  The instructor on the DVD though have plenty of methods to adjust each and ever move to your specific requirements.  All it required on the users part was a bit of common sense.  I found the pace to be perfect for my needs.

Now this is not a work-out program.  It is a set of precise positions at first; focusing of breathing of course, and then presents workouts ranging from 10 to 50 minutes.  I found I could sort of pick and choose what appealed to me on a daily basis.  I liked the fact that Barbara Benagh was not yakking constantly while she was herself performing each stance...her voice was in the background.

If you are considering purchasing this tape I strongly suggest you read Beth Cholette's review.  She has told us what is on the DVD so much better than I would ever be able to do. I have found that each of her statements and observations to be completely spot on.

Will this be the last Yoga DVD I purchase?  Goodness no!  I have already bought another.  I have found that I actually like this stuff!

2632073,3,B000H8RVSO,this dvd is a bit on the slow side. The hip openers section is the best but I needed something more challenging. Not for young and/or fit individuals that's new to yoga. Best for the not so flexible people,1322352000,,205,4.282051282051282
2632074,5,B000H8RVSO,"Beautifully filmed adjacent to the ocean, with peaceful wave sounds throughout the work out.  There are so many routines on this DVD I defy anybody to be dissatisfied with it.

2632075,5,B000H8RVSO,"Barbara Benagh provides viewers with an invigorating, easy to follow introduction to yoga. Throughout the video, she emphasises that you must not worry about being just like her or any other yogi out there. You must always understand that you're only just beginning a wonderful journey that takes time to adjust to.

As an individual with absolutely no yoga experience, she has allowed me to step into the world of yoga with tremendous ease. Her DVD contains an introduction to Yoga, a wealth of introductory knowledge and more advanced routines for you to follow when comfortable. Whether your goal is to start your day off right, relax from a hard day's work or build strength, she has a routine for you to enjoy.

I highly recommend this DVD if you are new and interested in yoga. My only suggestion is that you purchase a yoga mat if you do not have one. You will need it.",1321920000,,876,4.608974358974359
2632076,5,B000H8RVSO,I workout regularly but am new to Yoga.  I'm very happy with this DVD.  As a beginner I really like the variety of routines and that several of them are under half an hour long.  It works in great with the time I can set aside to exercise without having to decide between doing a yoga routine or another workout.  I can do them both.,1320624000,,333,4.076923076923077

2632078,5,B000H8RVSO,Great video for beginners.  The instructions are easy to follow and detailed; the instructor's voice is very relaxing.  I imagine a more advanced yoga practitioner could easily modify to get an even more challenging workout.,1319068800,,224,5.371428571428571
2632079,3,B000H8RVSO,"I just started practicing with this DVD about 3 days ago, and my initial impression is this:

The interview portion is very encouraging and supportive, but could have been much better spent imparting practical information to the beginner.  Yoga is an ancient practice....the body is a verb, not a noun...  OK, but what are these ""sit bones"" the instructor keeps mentioning during the Sun Salutations?  I have no idea.

Also, the camera work could be a little more helpful. During some of the faster moving poses, it would really help to see close-ups of how the instructor's hands and feet are placed. There's none of this so far, but you do get these weird close-ups of her torso and camera-pans out to the ocean behind her.  If I'm looking at the video, it's not for the scenery.

The instructor also wears loose-fitting pants, so it's very difficult to see if her knee is touching the mat during certain poses or the overall rotation/position of her legs.

Again, I've only just started with the DVD and my opinion may change with more practice.  On the other hand, I'm worried that I may not be getting the fundamentals straight because of details like this.  I will update my review if my opinion changes.",1318809600,4,1210,4.691943127962086
2632080,3,B000H8RVSO,The scenery is very beautiful. But the segment for the core is not for beginners. Some of the poses are very difficult for someone needing to build core strength. No alternative options were given.,1318723200,,197,4.823529411764706

I don't know if it's just me being out of shape or what, but this is supposed to be a beginner's set.

The beginning stuff seems like meditation with stretching,  concentrating on the breath and such.  It was definitely relaxing although she seems to use props a lot which kind of annoyed me.  I didn't want to run around looking for blankets or pillows to use for stretch moves.  I'm not sure how common it is to use stuff like that though for Yoga,  might be the norm.  I don't have any reason to not recommend this, but I'm not a yoga pro, this is really my first time doing it.",1316304000,2,644,4.308333333333334

The instructor goes through each pose slowly and provides a lot of clear instructions, with lots of reminders about proper alignment and to focus on the breath. The instructor also has a practical, down-to-earth style. Altogether there are 12 different routines, which are organized under ""getting started/targeted routines"" (20-30 minutes each) and ""as you progress/extended routines"" (30-70 minutes each). Using the main menu you can easily choose which routine(s) you want to do. I'm in good shape, but do not have a lot flexibility.

Overall I found the instruction clear and easy to follow and the path of the teaching made it easy to learn how to do yoga.

2632100,5,B000H8RVSO,"I just ordered this over a week ago and have been practicing every night since then. I started off listening to the Introduction, then I began with Targeted Routines. My hips tend to be very tight since I do a lot of running, I just did a Half Marathon and my hips were clicking a lot. This yoga video has routines targeted for specific areas; hips, standing positions, back stretches, standing poses, seated poses, etc,. I found the Hip Opener routine to be particularly helpful in releasing muscle tension! Since then I started some progressive routines, all of which offer a less demanding option if you're not flexible enough to handle the full position. I sleep better, my breathing is more controlled and even throughout my workday and I find myself sitting straighter as well. There are varying routines lengths ranging from 45-70 minutes as well as an evening routine (55) specifically designed to help release the stress of the day and ease your mind. I'll admit, I was never a yoga advocate before-hand. I took a few classes at my gym and always left feeling like I'd done nothing to improve my health or muscles. That is not the case in this instance! The instructor has a slow melodic voice allowing me to stay relaxed, behind her are the beautiful waves of Antigua and fortunately, the rush of the ocean is audible! Each movement is thoroughly described before she makes it allowing us to keep pace with her (which I am particularly thankful for! Never liked scrambling to catch up having to halve my reps or position hold time to get in sync). I'd highly recommend this video! For those of you who are worrying about hearing some whacky nonsense, she keeps that to a minimum and focuses on the movements and stretching.

There are two routines that are focused on breathing, while later on she introduces you to other things to do. As she mentions in the interview and as the instructions say, there are different things that you may find easier or harder to work with and you should start with the one or two that you are most comfortable with after viewing them. The breathing and hip openers were the ones I started with, and as I learned, was able to get better at the other items.",1289001600,,552,4.3173076923076925

She moves at a pace that is easy to follow, not too quickly, and she does not push you too far or hard.  The majority of the things on this can be done by pretty much anyone and I had no issues being able to do them.  I noticed some people mention it may be too slow, or that some things are clips, but to me it was not an issue.  In fact the vast majority of the items play straight through and transition from one to the next with no noticable delay.

It was a perfect selection for me and have been using it almost daily now for months and couldn't be more pleased.",1288656000,4,735,3.9060402684563758
2632138,1,B000H8RVSO,"I have recently become interested in yoga, so I was looking for a good dvd to get me started.  I purchased Rodney Yee's ""yoga for beginners"" (which I love) and this one by Barbara Benagh.  I could do all of the poses in the different work outs, but she holds them much longer than a beginner would possibly have the strength to hold them.  I am in my twenties and live an active lifestyle and I can't hold the poses even half as long as she does.  You can literally do the poses with her while fast forwarding the dvd.

One thing that does concern me, is that many of the transitions between poses I don't feel like I can safely do.  For example, when transitioning between standing forward bend and mountain pose she has you put your arms above your head and stand up.  This puts a lot of stress on my lower back.  It is possible that I do not understand how to do the movement correctly or that I am not yet strong enough in the lower back to perform the transition.  Instead of risking injury I have chosen to modify many of the movements.

I was not impressed with the quality of the dvd.  It seems like she performed her workout once then voiced over it.  One thing that is particularly bothersome is that the long workouts are actually pieces of the shorter work outs played one after the other.  You can hear the player searching for the next spot to continue playing from in the middle of the workout.

Overall I was not impressed with this dvd and have stopped using it.",1288569600,59,1479,4.292418772563177

I enjoy using videos to workout with and have many.  I have been doing yoga but wanted to implement the pilates back into my life.  I am so glad that I started with this one.  The pace is a nice easy pace and the exercises are easy to follow.  Any new beginner will have no problem following this line up.

I was very positively surprised. The instruction is competent, detailed and to the point. There are no hollow pep-talks, fake smiles or catchy slogans - instead Ms. Benagh clearly tells you what to do with your muscles and joints and with your breathing in order to achieve the desired effects of the Yoga exercises. There are a variety of programs with different goals and levels of difficulty.

Barbara Benagh explains what to do while doing the exercises herself, on a platform overlooking a nice beach. What contributes to the relaxation experienced while following her instructions quite a bit is her peaceful, calming voice.

While the other DVD I have is more targeted to specific health issues and can be used for beginners and also for people who have been practicing longer, this is more general instruction to get you started and bring you long.

The first main yoga section to use is one where you can learn various poses in routines that are round 20 minutes which focus on breathing, standing, strength and hips and then has another section with more moves with workouts that are longer and has some more material.

The second yoga section adds more material and provides longer workouts to add to your yoga with routines range from 30 minutes to an hour, so there is a lot to work with.

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars, because as with any exercise DVD, you have no idea if you're doing the pose correctly or incorrectly. I will admit after doing the DVD a handful of times and then going to a yoga class, I did realize I was doing some of the poses incorrectly.

2632165,5,B000H8RVSO,"I decided to buy a yoga DVD after taking a yoga class and becoming distressed at how weak and stiff I was.  I bought this DVD because of the many positive reviews.

The DVD is good for absolute beginners.  It's challenging, but not discouragingly so.  You can do it even if you're not strong and not flexible.  I like the fact that there are different sequences, one as short as 10 minutes, so that I can mix it up a little and don't get really bored.  Also, I can squeeze a sequence in even if I have very little time.  I especially like the backbends one.

Barbara's voice is calming and her directions are very good.  Sometimes it seems like she's there in the room, since her comments always seem to be on target.  She's not there to dazzle you with her agility or to shame you into injuring yourself, but to teach you how to do the poses properly.  She gives adequate time to transition from pose to pose.  She gives alternatives for those who are more and less capable.

So far, I have only done one sequence in the Extended Routines section of the DVD.  I don't recall which one, but I admit I was a little disappointed; it was longer, but not harder than the ones in the Getting Started section.  However, some of the other ones may be much harder.

I don't think this will be the only DVD I ever use, but most likely, no DVD could play that role.  If I lived near Barbara, I would not hesitate to study with her. Since that's not possible and since I do get bored (I've been using the DVD every morning for weeks now), I will probably soon purchase something that has even more targeted sequences (for arms, glutes, abs, or even another strength one that's just different).  However, I think it's excellent for encouraging someone who may be apprehensive and/or at a very beginning stage while still teaching ""real"" yoga.",1276560000,4,1830,4.411940298507463

She was right on with her words.  Barbara is a very good instructor that makes the yoga easy to do as a beginner.  The workouts range in time and difficulty with the starting ones that are easy and to guide breathing, which consist of some shorter segments.

Later on the items are more difficult.  The Energizing and Strength routines, for instance, have Sun Salutations, Standing Poses and Bends (depending on which ones you do) in longer sections, though Barbara does add some relaxation moves at the very end when you are done working through the other parts of the workout.

The video transitions in from a shot of the beach to a woman who goes through the pose. The pose is slower than yoga normally is, the description of the pose is  very delayed (the audio starts description and half way through description the person starts the pose). Once the pose is complete the video transitions out via a shot of the beach and we come back in for the next pose which doesn't transition well with the pose you just completed.
For example, I tried one routine and I was up for one pose, sitting for the next, up for the next pose, sitting for the next and there is NO transition between poses. It's not like going from downward facing dog to upward facing dog where it's one continual movement..... it's start from a standing poistion 'do downward facing dog' then stand....then the next pose, go into 'upward facing dog' and stand....it's terrible.
Yoga is about the continual flow of energy throughout the moves. not, one move you're done, now then next move you're done..and so on. .

And she is.  She really teaches well and understands beginners in her instruction and cues.  She aso allows you to use things to help yourself, such as books (yoga blocks) and belts (either as a standard belt or yoga belt) and a couple of other things.  Some other DVDs did not have these and it made it more difficult to work with.

Then I realized that I needed to find something a little more elementary and investigated, ordered this DVD and hoped I was on the right track.

The DVD came, I popped it in and found that it was great for me.  She is clear about what the poses consist of and many times, as long as you are listening well, you don't need to constantly look at the screen.  I like the 20 minute segments as someone who is just beginning, the variety is great, and I really enjoy knowing that I have a long ways to go because there are more challenging parts of the DVD to build up to!

2632183,5,B000H8RVSO,"I have to say that I love this DVD.  Like many others who have reviewed Yoga for Beginners I have done Yoga at the gym.  Sometimes I still do.  But this DVD really helps me remember what Yoga is supposed to be.  Now I am not criticizing those that use it as such, but Yoga is not just a workout.  It is about balance, calm, breath and being in the moment.  It is about appreciating your body where it is and striving to reach farther.  This DVD provides both short and long routines and lets you take your time so that you can really feel the poses.  When I reach for this DVD, and I have been reaching for it everyday, it is never because I have to exercise but because I want to.

So if you want a sweaty, heavy breathing, working out type of program...well this isn't for you.  But if you want a DVD that is going to leave you feeling calm, balanced, standing tall and, best of all, relaxed then get this DVD as fast as you can.

2632184,1,B000H8RVSO,"The pace of the workouts was slower than slow.  Her directions lagged behind the video which was confusing in the begginning.  Transitions from one portion of the workout to another were abrupt and the editting was poor.  She is not graceful in her movements which did not inspire me much. It advertises a wide variety of workouts but in fact, most are targetted to specific body areas and are very brief.  The two longer workouts are almost the same except for the addition of a few more challenging poses in one.  I am very disappointed with this purchase.",1271289600,41,558,4.653061224489796

I ordered two Beginner yoga DVD's and this one is by far my favorite!  Barbara is wonderful and so easy to follow; she mentions modifications for poses that not everyone may be able to do and encourages you through each series.  The DVD has seperate 10-30 minute pose series' as well as longer, more in depth routines.  The menu is extrememly easy to follow and use.  I would CERTAINLY reccomend this to anyone new to yoga that does not want to spend the money at a studio; I think I will use this DVD for a long time and hope to order some of Barbra's more advanced DVD's when that time comes!
PS- the DVD is set on a serene beach with beautiful sands and waters, my kind of place for the concentration yogo involves!  :)",1270598400,,844,4.343949044585988

She really understands how to convey information and make the yoga approachable.  Some really good exercises including breathing exercises that I find very relaxing and were things I could do from the start and also other things to really stretch your body, which is the real reason I decided to do yoga.  I find I do not have to do as much stretching before exercising with other things, like jogging, because it has helped make me limber.  (Though of course stretching before other exercises is a good idea.)",1269820800,,664,4.601694915254237
2632187,2,B000H8RVSO,"This is not a DVD for beginners.  There is not enough explanation regarding how to breathe and the importance of it and how to appropriately stretch to avoid injury.  In my opinion a newcomer to yoga will be lost with this DVD as the instructor doesn't explain enough about the poses, how to do them, alternatives for the less flexible and strong and transitioning through poses.  I took yoga classes a few years ago, but stopped due to illness and started again on my own for the last 3 months.  I've regained strength and flexibility, but I could not do the majority of the poses on this DVD and certainly not for the length of time the instructor holds them.  This DVD is for individuals who know yoga and have the strength and flexibility to do more strenuous poses.

I also recommend Larry Payne's The Classic Beginner's Program for Men & Women from Samata International.

2632190,2,B000H8RVSO,"I just got this dvd after reading great reviews. I watched all of it (most in fast forward because she is so slow) and I have to say I am not impressed. Although she takes the time to explain breathing and technique, there is really only one long routine and then edited and labeld with different titles. So when you click on the ""rejuvinating"" part it is a 20 minute clip of the long routine. Also, 2/3 of the video are breathing exercises (which I think are good) but way excessive. Then there is way too much laying on your back stretching with little yoga poses.

Some of the women from my churh (most over 45) and I did a few of these routines together before we all decided that is more for meditaion and less 'yoga'. I do agree that this is a good video for beginers #someone who has never even heard of yoga, but it doesn't offer enough yoga. If you enjoy doing different poses #not just lying on the ground stretching# then I do not suggest this video. I mean even the senior citizens from church were left wanting more.

My suggestion is to buy a video (used is possible# of basic poses in step by step form. Do that a few times until you have the poses down. Then get an intermediate video and do the routines that you feel comfortable with. At least that way you are getting a good strength and flexibility work out routine.",1268352000,30,1336,4.2976190476190474

2632193,3,B000H8RVSO,"I went to my first yoga class while visiting NYC and enjoyed it so much that the very same day I ordered this video and AM/PM Yoga For Beginners, bought a yoga belt and mat.  I live in an isolated area with no access to classes or other practicers and based on reviews and ""Beginner"" in the titles, I thought this would be the best for me.  The class I went to in NYC was intense, I was sweating by the end and felt incredible for the rest of the day and a similar glow stayed with me for several days.  I've done this video more than once and thought it was kind of boring and not challenging at all.  Some of the descriptions could have been better and the quality of the video as a teaching tool is low.  Sometimes there are shadows when she's on the floor and it's difficult to see if she's lifting herself up, a lot of transitions are bad - suddenly she's in a new pose and most importantly: there should be multiple shots and multiple frames at once so you can see what the teacher is doing from multiple angles - this way you know what you're doing is correct.  When I first started to do this video, there was a lot of stopping and going, since I'm new to it and I wanted to get the basics right.  At the same time, I was looking for something that was at least a little physically challenging - like the class I went to in NYC and this was not challenging... but it WAS comforting to my body (and maybe Barbara's constant patient comments and alternatives if you aren't flexible has me thinking I'm much better than I am).  I DID enjoy this video and wouldn't return it, I think it's a valuable assess to a beginners collection, however if I'd been able to rent it first, then I would've gone with something else to purchase.  So now I've ordered Yoga Shakta and Shiva Rea: Daily Energy, which I'm hoping will be more challenging.",1267401600,4,1839,4.231428571428571

There are many instances in which you cannot tell if you should be breathing in or out, and if you glimpse the video, you will see the instructor doing something that she isn't describing yet.

I like how it has about 8 20 minute sessions in just the beginner part too. So far I've only done a few but I haven't had to go into crazy positions or anything yet. In terms of the look and feel of the video, its oki. It plays a waves ocean sound and uses a woman's voice for instruction. It's pleasant to listen to, and the setting the instructor is in is calm looking (on a beach in front of waves). My first yoga video, but it so far works for me.",1266796800,,627,4.105691056910569

The directions are so good.  After the first couple times of doing a routine I don't even have to look at the tv.  You can get it right just by listening and doing what she says.

2632202,2,B000H8RVSO,"I'm giving this DVD two stars because what is missing outweighs what is in it.

Pros
 - slow, smooth pace
 - gentle, calm narrative

Cons
 - no separate discussion of breathing: techniques, principles, types
 - no section demonstrating each of the basic poses used in the DVD

In regard to the cons, Barbara will will mention focusing on breathing or using a specific breathing technique, but there isn't more of an explanation of how or what you should be doing. The same thing for the basic poses. Barbara will occasionally mention the name of the pose that she is leading us into, but without a clear reference of what that pose is or what it looks like, it's hard to know if I am doing the pose right or even have the correct pose to the name she is using.

The DVD could be great if there were more instruction on the basics of breathing and poses.",1264636800,14,853,4.388535031847134

Also, she does a great job encouraging you to focus on breathing, which is so imporant for beginners. I also love that the 'learning' section has five 20-minute sections to focus on certain poses. This fits my schedule perfectly in the morning. She doesn't hold poses too long, and takes everything at a great pace.

2632205,5,B000H8RVSO,"Appreciate all the detail from prior reviewers.  Spent a lot of time reading reviews of all ""beginner"" yoga DVDs.  Glad this was the one I chose.  Recovering from pulling lower back muscle & needed to expand from couple stretching exercises from Doctor. I watched thru entire DVD as suggested & you need to as well.  Parts were hard to just sit thru & watch, but fast forward came in handy for parts of the process.  Appreciated ability to pick & choose which beginner sections I wanted to do (differing lengths), can't do all of them in 1 day; able to choose couple of different program lengths to suit schedule & could focus right now on lower back.  Looking foward to expanding to do the rest of the beginner sections and move on to the next level exercises - would be further along, but I gotta get my back muscles strong again.  Nice menu set up & easier to follow than I expected.  I can see where 1 reviewer was a bit impatient, one of the initial 30 min programs seems to be best done after a long day at work because basically relaxation, but it does teach breathing very well.  I'll be able to take that lesson into all my exercising, not just yoga.  Glad I chose this one to start, never done Yoga before & sure miss my regular exercising at least 1 hour 5x/week combining powerwalking, bicycling, Kathy Smith/Karen Voight/few other DVDs.  So easy to gain weight.  At least I feel like I'm doing something effective with these yoga exercises.  I don't feel tired when done, actually feel like I've exerted myself without worrying about slight strain in my back from the twists, it goes away in just a few minutes and has gotten less ""strained"" as I continue.  Been at it 2 weeks now.

There are times when you can't even see the TV to see what it being done and you have to stop, look, listen and then get into the pose only to have her move on to something else.

I have been using this DVD for 4 months now 3 days a week.  I am more flexible now than I was 15 years ago.  If you like this DVD, you will like her DVD for Stress relief and for AM/PM.  These are for beginners too, and will give you more routines to mix up your yoga time.

Note:  just when you think you should move onto harder routines, start paying attention to all the narration from Benagh.  It will push you to perfect your technique and makes all the poses you think you can do well all the more difficult.

I had no idea there was so much breathing involved. I was doing a dvd before but it wasn't as good as this one is.

I don't remember ever doing some of these poses--and she holds some of the poses for so long, I come out of them, and am not in position to move to the next routine. I read some reviews from women who felt the same way, and ordered Yoga for Yourself, and love it. I'll hang on to Yoga Not for Beginners, and maybe 4 or 5 years from now try it again. It's not an atmosphere for success, such as Yoga for Yourself. I feel like she just had someone film her workouts, and she's been doing it for 30 years!

Barbara's teaching has allowed me to really learn the poses and be able to do them. As she says in her interview, work throough the poses and take your time - do not expect to look like she does quite yet in doing the routines, it takes time.

The first level consists of routines that run 20-30 minutes or so and each one has a series of poses that move from one to the next in a flowing routine which leads you from one pose into the next.  The next level adds some more poses and extends the routines.  I am feeling better doing this DVD and the breathing exercises are nice and calming.  Nothing too difficult on the DVD and it teaches the basics poses of yoga well.

 Barbara has a very good understanding of the needs of beginners and it comes through here.

Highly recommended.",1234915200,,908,4.2631578947368425

The positions get harder as you work thru the cd which I like. You can either continue in an easier pose or move thru to a more difficult level. I do the sun salutations in the am for a 30 min. wake up and stretch. The setting is just beautiful and relaxing.

I've been doing a combination of the different getting started routines almost daily for about a month and a half, and I can already tell a huge difference. I am way more flexible, and have no more lower back pain. Its a great way to start or end your day. My one complaint is that while there are 2 sections getting started and extended routines,each with a number of routines, when I went to start on the extended routines, found out they are just different combinations of the getting started routines. I was looking forward to expanding poses. But still, the routines don't get old, and I will still be using this dvd for a while.",1234051200,2,746,4.452554744525547

After reading the interview with Barbara Benagh that's on Amazon I was interested in seeing what she had to say on the DVD. DO watch the interview. She is an accomplished, experienced instructor. The tips and insight are things that I try and remember when doing my yoga. The best tips were to be patient and keep at it and not to expect to look like her in the poses right away. I'm new to yoga and I haven't found anything in the DVD so far that I can't do.

The first two routines I got bored with fairly easily, but the next routine, Sun Salutations, is a bit advanced.  She could spend a bit more time telling you exactly HOW to do the pose, instead of just showing it.  I am struggling through this 3rd routine, and I am a fairly flexible person.

I like the way it is broken down in sections where you can work on some of the moves and breathing then moves onto more poses and longer routines where there is one of my favorites - the Rejuvenate Routine which is easy to do but feels very good and can be done by anyone - you start the poses by lying down and breathing.

Getting Started

As You Progress

As the names sugeest the first section is geared towards starting you off.  It covers all the basics - standing poses, seated poses etc, with pointers and sugesstions on how to make the psoes work and proper breathing.  I found this section valuable to and help me isolate the moves and to learn them.

The second second builds upon the first section and adds more poses and leads more into details of the practice plus expands into more of the benefits in the routines such as working on strength or just relaxing.

Good selection of routines that bring things along well.",1230508800,3,742,4.568181818181818

2632269,5,B000H8RVSO,"I rented this DVD from my library about a week ago. I'd always wanted to try yoga and although I'm in pretty good shape, I'm not that flexible so yoga intimidated me. Within 2 days of working with the DVD I knew that I had to buy my own copy off of Amazon! (BTW I just paid for regular shipping, but the DVD arrived in a day and a half. Nice!)
I loved the sheer variety of routines on this DVD. They are split up into two levels, ""as you get started"" and ""as you progress"". Only a week into it, I'm still finding the ""as you get started"" routines very challenging but not impossible. I think that there's enough on this DVD to keep me interested and learning new things for at least a year or two! If you're like me and you've never tried yoga, let me tell you that during the excercise you will work hard (like any good excercise) but after completing one of Barbara Benagh's yoga routines I find that my breathing is deep and slow, and feel like I've just had a full-body massage (QUITE unlike any excercise I've ever done!!!)
Her instructions are so clear that it's easy to follow along. She's challenging but very encouraging, making sure that you don't feel bad if you can't get into a particular pose, and offering you other easier options if you need them. She somehow offers lots of information while using very few words, this helps to keep her instrucions understandable to the novice.
I also want to add that I wanted to learn yoga without all of the ""emptying your mind"" new-agey type of stuff, and this DVD definately lets me accomplish that. I believe in freedom of religion and I don't look down on yogis who practice the way that they wish, and likewise as a Christian I felt that my beliefs were respected in this DVD.

The interview is very worthwhile to watch. It helped answer questions for me in getting a basic understanding of what to expect over time in using the DVD and in yoga in general.  Barbara was able to make me, as a beginner, feel comfortable with her words.

You can target your exercises for specific parts of your body, like hamstrings, or choose a type of workout like the energizing one or quiet evening one. This was a well designed beginners program.

I especially recommend this DVD if you intend to exercise before work. She has a soothing voice, the ocean views are lovely, and the degree of difficulty is appropriate. She also is the most articulate of the instructors I've experienced--she explains details of body position that others overlook, yet she seems to speak relatively little -- you really can get absorbed in the practice.",1219968000,3,502,5.134146341463414

STARTING

 Backbends
 Standing Poses
 Strength and Balance
 Sun Salutations
 Seated Hip Openers

LONGER ROUTINES

 Basics
 Energizing
 Strength
 Rejuvenate
 Breathing and Centering

2632282,5,B000H8RVSO,"I ordered this dvd after reading a lot of reviews for this and other dvds, and I'm so happy I purchased this one.  The program went slow enough so I didn't feel overwhelmed as a beginner.  Each pose is described well and special attention is placed on having the correct form.

You can always tell if a fitness program is good by the amount of sore muscles the next day...let me tell you, I was sore.  There is a lot of variation in the workouts and it is quite nice to be able to pick and choose from so many programs on one dvd.

I'd recommend this to anyone.",1213574400,2,561,4.110091743119266
2632283,5,B000H8RVSO,"I am not at all experienced with yoga. Nevertheless Barbara Benagh has unique teaching skills that lead you through routines very gently and the most important very clearly. The words that she uses to describe each pose give a precise picture of the breathing and its coordination with the parts of the body the pose emphasizes. Therefore, you become independent from the images relatively quickly. Also, the moderate pace of the transitions gives you enough time to adjust in the pose and learn about it. Although these are obvious and expected characteristics of a live yoga lesson, I understand they are difficult to gage in a DVD where the instructor can't have direct contact with the students. This is not an issue for Mrs. Benagh who has the ability to bring herself close to the student even from a screen.
Because the routines are targeted they can be selected according to your mood and time availability. This structure of targeted routines gives a chance for the parts of your body to recover from one routine while you are still able to practice another routine, say on the next day.
The location is beautiful and it is very pleasant to hear the sound of the waves on the sea during the practice.",1213488000,5,1209,4.734597156398104

Then when you have gone through these routines sufficiently, there are longer, complete Yoga routines (I am not there yet; I have decided to really take time in learning the basics, something you cannot always do when you take a Yoga class).

I took a 6 week yoga class so I did have some experience before I started this DVD but I don't think that an average person would have any problem following along. It's broken up into different sections, which is great. The first part works on getting you accustomed to the poses you'll be doing throughout, then you can get into targeted routines, and there's a last part that I haven't even made it to yet. This DVD targets your abs and stomach, legs, and breathing.

The instructor is calm and encouraging.  In several poses she suggests (and shows) modifications you can use if need to.

I cant say that I ""hate"" the video, but I also cant say that I ""love"" it.  I think I might just be spoiled because in my class, the instructor very thoroughly describes each posture, why we do each one, the benefits, lets us do each one a minimum of three times, etc.  This video just seems to move a little fast for someone that is a true beginner.  By the time I would finally get my body into the best posture that I could, she was on to the next one!

I'm coming back to yoga after many years of thinking it couldn't do me any good. This is a wonderful DVD to use to get back into it. It offers am/pm workouts of various lengths -- pick one, or combine a couple. Benagh looks and sounds like a genuinely nice person. In my opinion, she is a gifted instructor and worth checking out if ashtanga and hot yoga are really not your thing.

For instance, if you're in a certain mood, you can do a routine that's good for that mood or if you would like to only do a routine for a certain length of time, there's an option for that too.  It's not like the Yoga for dummies, where there aren't many options or different routines.  I like it!!",1206921600,5,371,4.111111111111111
2632306,5,B000H8RVSO,"Whether you're preparing for a class or learning yoga on your own, a DVD really helps to ground you in the basics. I found Yoga for Beginners a great, relaxing way to get a handle on core positions.

You start out by watching the basic area. This area has short segments that help you understand the starting moves. The aim here is to watch each short segment - and practice the moves - until they start to make sense to you.

They have 10 minute backbends, 20 minute standing poses, 20 minute strength / balance, 20 minute sun salutations, 30 minute seated hip openers. You'll find some of these might be challenging for your current strength and bend ability - but this is actually great! It means you have something to look forward to as you improve and grow. If everything was super easy at the beginning, the DVD wouldn't be much help! So you practice these moves for a while, figuring out which you can do and which you need to work on.

Then you go on to the actual full workout sessions. There is 70 minute basics, 40 minute energizing, 70 minute strength, 30 minute rejuvinate, and 55 minute quieting. Each segment has its own focus, so you can easily pick and choose which one you're going to work on. You might find some easy and relaxing. Others might be a bit challenging at the beginning.

So for example the quieting session was really relaxing, lovely, stretchy. On the other hand, the strength session involves some moves that I had to just watch. My arm strength wasn't up there yet. However, I could do much of it and it definitely was building up strength - and I look forward to when I can do it all start to finish.

The background is simply gorgeous, with the gentle ocean, the sands and the blue skies. It really helps me to feel peaceful and relaxed. The woman's voice is peaceful, calm, and provides a lot of great pointers for adjusting poses based on your current skill level.

Highly recommended for beginners - and the DVD will ""grow with you"" to allow you to keep enjoying it even as you improve.",1206835200,300,2027,4.464864864864865
2632307,5,B000H8RVSO,"Absolutely wonderful.  It is a great place to start with many different routines.  I like the fact that there isn't any music, just the waves in the background.  It is relaxing to listen to the waves, but I like to put on my own music.  I reccomend doing ""Basic Yoga For Dummies"" before attempting this DVD though.  The previous DVD will show you how to do the poses correctly, and then you can do the routines in this DVD without straining yourself.

It uses your muscles and gets you moving in ways other activities and sports don't.  These workouts move at a good speed.  They aren't so slow that you get bored and they aren't so fast that you can't figure out what's going on.  I'm new to yoga and this program has been exactly what I was looking for.",1192406400,44,464,4.168539325842697
2632330,4,B000H8RVSO,I am a true beginner and this is geared FOR the beginner. I can't wait until I can bend and twist with the same ease as the instructor. It has given me a positive goal to reach! Much recomended.,1192406400,11,194,4.0
2632331,5,B000H8RVSO,"Clear instruction and a beautiful beach setting make this a first rate, enjoyable yoga DVD.  After watching through once I'm finding that the directions on how and when to breath and how to move different parts of my body are so good and easy to follow that I don't really have to even look at the TV.",1192406400,38,301,4.280701754385965
2632332,5,B000H8RVSO,"What a fantastic yoga video!  This one will have a long shelf-life for me with 10 routines on it.  The ""Getting Started"" section has 5 different routines ranging from 10 to 30 minutes and they are all different.  I'm looking forward to gaining enough strength and flexibility to move on to ""As You Progress,"" where there's 5 more routines.  These are longer ranging from 30 to 70 minutes.  Still a bit too much for me to handle in one session, but I know I will get there!",1191888000,17,472,4.379310344827586
2632333,5,B000H8RVSO,"I have never done yoga before and wanted to learn, so I picked up this DVD.  All I can say is that is it done extremely well and Barbara really explains things to you.  It is very easy to follow and understand.  If you want to learn yoga from a great instructor, I would definitely pick this one up!",1190073600,81,299,4.033898305084746

2632335,4,B000H8RVSO,"I am a total beginner, and I am pleased with this video. I bought Power Yoga - Total Body Workout Starring Rodney Yee, but it was too advanced. Then I bought GAIAM's Yoga for Beginners, but it was awful. I guess the instruction was OK, but it had this ugly pink and blue background and looks like something from the 70's, not filmed on a beach as a photo on the DVD box implies.

The only think I don't like about this DVD is something I've noticed in several yoga videos - the instructor saying very odd things without explaining them, like ""pull your navel through your spine"" or ""expand your heart through your hands"" or ""root yourself"". I try not to stress when I hear things like that that I totally don't get, but my husband gets really bugged by it.",1181174400,140,756,4.323943661971831

2632338,5,B000H8RVSO,"This is tough to follow as a beginner, but it is broken down well and the encouragement is there as well as the information to go at your own pace and to be patient.  The setting is great and the speaker easy to listen to.",1174089600,55,222,3.933333333333333

Something for everyone. I started this because I had a tweek in my back, and after a few weeks I feel much better.  I'm ordering other products from this instructor.

8137629,3,B000H8RVSO,"A noon doesn't know what 'Asana' is, how to perform the posture. The instructor assumes you have 'some' knowledge of yoga, but doesn't consider it from a virgin'so view.
The instructions are rather muddled and she seems to striving for meditational value more than instruction of postures.
I found myself paying more attention to her 'soothing' voice than the actual exercise, and it seemed rushed. Granted, they had a limited production budget.
It's  not a BAD video, and the price I paid wasn't aweful, I just think that she should 'dumb it down' for us newbies.",1525305600,,564,4.875
