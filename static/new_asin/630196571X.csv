388163,4,630196571X,"It is only when an actress takes the risk of portraying a character whose persona does not already reside wholly within her but must be constructed from experience and talent, can one be classified as a truly great actress.  Davis's portrayal of the caring school teacher is believeable and touching, in part because she has an edge to her that makes one believe that she could live this rather harsh existence in Wales with pride and dignity.  I find it refreshing to see a performance which is risky for the perfomer because everyone grows from it and the fan gets a new glimpse of real talent.  I will always hold this performance of Davis's as a most special one because, although one senses she can bite if needed, the dialogue is not her typical ""chip on the shoulder"" jargon.  Lovely movie, great story, refreshing performances.",997401600,12,835,4.7379310344827585

388176,3,630196571X,"Bette's performance is flawless. But the film is too long and the outdoor scenes are obviously shot on a soundstage.

And this was a distracting problem for me--  did EVERYONE in this Welsh mining town have a beautiful singing voice?! If so, why were they slaving away in mines?  They could've made their living as a traveling choral group. It was almost laughable.

It's a feminist story--as were many of her films--but it's also a tale about the fight against provincial thinking and despair.  Kids who take their educations for granted, should see what people used to go through if they wanted a real education, and what they were up against.  It's a story of realized hopes, dreams and ambitions against very intimidating odds and attitudes.  Inspirational.

388218,5,630196571X,"Bette Davis was never greater than she is in this film. The character of Miss Moffat is a woman of intense sensibilities who can recognize in the unformed clay a student in her remote Wales school with exceptional writer abilities, Morgan Evans.  The descent  of the highly educated Miss Moffatt, rather like Mary Poppins arriving under an umbrella  rather galvanizing the small town seeped in poverty and ignorance.  In 1895 the  male population of the small town of Glansarno went to the coal mines, there was no other choice. Only education would free them from the shackles.

The corn is green by Emlyn Williams opened on the London stage in 1938 with Williams himself playing Morgan Evans. The play went through many editions, some awful but no production is superior to this one with Bette Davis. It is not only Davis who shines- the whole cast inspires sympathy even when behaving badly. Joan Lorring as the very young strumpet Bessie Watty , flirting in an amost frenetic way, flouncing around and seducing Morgan Evans, puts on her bravado peacock display to get attention. When she enters Miss Moffat's house she is asked for her name and she says as if anybody said I got a name at all. Nigel Bruce, playing the Squire who owns most of Glansarno is called a nincompoop by Miss Moffat right to his face but in his loveable way  he lets Moffat win him over and he is instrumental in getting Morgan Evans an application to Harvard. (Even though as he says often, he's Cambridge). Mildred Dunnock is perfect as the twittering Miss Ronberry, a marvelous foil to the decidedly  non-twittery Miss Moffat.

John Dall portrays Morgan Evans and he's very effective as the stubborn, belligerent  black-faced coal miner who slowly emerges, slowly morphs into a scholar with a love of books and learning. But it is a hard struggle as his fellow miners call him the teacher's little dog. He gets Bessie pregnant as he is looking for warmth, and Miss Moffat, who always calls him Evans not Morgan,  remains emotionally aloof, emotionally cold. Morgan has to grow up, he has to understand that an education will free him from the coal mine, free his shackled soul. And he realizes, finally. that Miss Moffat has made his escape possible.

Corn is a visually beautiful in black and white,and renders the starkness of Glansarno perfectly but it is not an abject starkness. The joyful faces of the coal besmirched boys as they return at dusk from the mine and their marvelous singing as they trudge along will bring tears to your eyes.",1414972800,,2527,4.757437070938215

388222,5,630196571X,"In my earlier years, I really didn't have an appreciation for Bette Davis.  I believe this film was the turning point for me!  I had seen it on TCM at one time and was completely taken by the performance she gave, and I immediately began seeking out her other films; I have not been disappointed.

In this movie, her role as a feisty, determined, dedicated school teacher in a working class village in Wales conveys a depth of spirit and wisdom that carries the film.  She is unflappable under stress and undeterred by obstacles, qualities which are sorely needed to educate illiterate coal miners' children and their kin.  Her star pupil is at once reluctant and eager, cooperative and stubborn, a nice match for Davis' staid and determined position.  His achievements are her reward, and they give her the impetus to keep going when it looks like she has met her match in a situation which threatens to undo all the good she has done.  Not wanting to inject a spoiler here, let it suffice to say that she overcomes the obstacle with grit and determination and saves the day.

The setting, scenery, and contributing skill of the other actors in the film lend a great deal to the overall beauty of this drama.  I especially liked  the lighting, shadows and interior shots of the rooms where Davis (""Miss Moffat"") resides and works--they cast a glow and sense of serenity in the midst of the harshness of the hard reality in the lives of the townspeople.

Bette Davis and Sidney Poitier on SOCIAL JUSTICE:

THEY BOTH LOOKED THE WORLD IN THE EYE and did not like what they saw!!!!

Bette Davis acting in the movie ""The Corn is Green""(1945) in the role of L.C. Moffat, an English school marm who has inherited a house in Wales; highly educated for her time, Ms. Moffat, moved by the squalor, poverty and ignorance of an illiterate people: one of Bette's LINES:

""I wonder whoever started the ridiculous rumor that we live in a civilized world?""....When I was quite a young girl, I LOOKED THE WORLD IN THE EYE and decided I didn't like it. I saw poverty and disease, ignorance and injustice and in a small way I've always done what I could to fight them""....

The writing in The Corn In Green is remarkably advanced for 1945.

-New York Herald Tribune

Bette Davis gives a sharp, vital interpretation of Miss Moffat(the spinster teacher fighting to educate the poor children of a Welsh mining village)...by remaining true to its legitimate stage counterpart,"" adds the Hearld Tribune.

The story, based on Emlyn Williams' autobiographical play, focuses on the relationship between Miss Moffat and her gifted young prodigy from the mines, Morgan Evans (John Dall). ""Consumed by inward fire, by the sheer joy of imparting knowledge"" (London Picture Post), she molds him into a legitimate candidate for an Oxford scholarship in the remarkably short span of two years. Despite the disaster of Morgan's seduction by trouble-making Bessie (Joan Lorring), the mutual struggle between teacher and pupil becomes a glorious triumph of the human spirit.

""Only Bette Davis....could have combatted so successfully the obvious intention of the adaptors of the play to make frustrated sex the mainspring of the plot.""

388278,4,630196571X,"Bette Davis stars as Miss Moffat, who inherits a home in a Welsh mining town and decides that she will educate the young, especially the boys, who are otherwise doomed to a life in the mines.  One student, played by John Dall, gets her attention when he reveals depth beyond what she expected, and before long, they are working hard towards getting him a scholarship to Oxford.  However, the housekeeper's conniving daughter threatens to ruin everything.  Davis is very good as the crusading, very emotionally controlled middle-aged teacher, only once in a while letting us see her act.  The supporting cast are all good, with Dall especially strong as the student fighting against his background.  There is the occasional moment of stiff dialogue, but there are also some terrific lines as the intense relationship between teacher and student is explored.  Irving Rapper doesn't have much punch as a director in this or any of his other films that I have seen, but the story is the kind that will draw you in and having you rooting for the underdog.",1036713600,19,1050,4.837988826815643
388279,4,630196571X,"Bette Davis does a commendable job portraying L.C. Moffat, the prim, spinsterish English school teacher who comes to the small village of Glensarno, Wales to claim a house she's inherited.  Moffat is appalled at the lack of education received by the young men who live in ignorance and squalor in the mining community, so she decides to set up her own school and teach what she can to those who are willing to learn. Miss Moffat's prize pupil is Morgan Evans (John Dall, his debut) who shows natural intelligence, perhaps genius...Rosalind Ivan does well as Watty, the reformed shoplifter who has become an activist in a militant religious group.  Joan Lorring also made her debut in the movies playing - with considerable skill - Bessie, Watty's strumpet daughter who eventually complicates matters with her feminine ""charms"".  Davis is so terribly noble and plays the martyr with such conviction that you are only subconsciously aware of the sexual undercurrent between the student and teacher; her devotion to Evans is at once gently heartfelt and  and poignantly bitter.  Mildred Dunnock borders on being a pain as the prim Miss Ronberry and Rys Williams is adequately square as Mr. Jones, the shop clerk.  Nigel Bruce does well enough as the pompous Squire, a landowner who is ultimately ""won-over"" by the ""charm"" of Miss Moffat (did she resort to using clever psychology perchance?).",1024099200,15,1389,5.043668122270742
388280,4,630196571X,"The movie opens as the Welsh miners return from a day in the pits. One wonders why they aren't all carving out for themselves careers in the arts, since the combined force of their voices as they merrily sing their way across hill and dale rivals the Mormon Tabernacle Choir for sound. Of course, if you happen to live in Wales, this kind of virtuosic performance would probably be a fact of everyday life to you. As would those strained, tortured accents. Rhys Williams has a few amusing moments, but one worries about his apparent identity complex-he can't seem to make up his mind whether he is Welsh or Irish, so he throws in a little of both just to be sure. Similarly, John Dall (who would nowadays be largely forgotten were it not for his role as one of the notorious killers in Hitchcock's 'Rope') tries desperately to convince Bette Davis that he is just a poor kid who all his life knew nothing other than impoverished village life in the heart of Wales, but his accent gives him away-he was obviously brought up in America, with brief stints in Ireland and Scotland, before being transported to his current locale.
Mocking aside, this is a good movie. We can forgive Hollywood for the awful attempts at Welsh accents (any Americans reading this review are probably sitting there bemused, thinking, What, so they don't really talk like that in Wales? Yeh, sure-and all the Londoners I know sound just like Dick Van Dyke). It is a moving story of an early feminist who takes it upon herself to educate the deprived children of a small mining community. She faces opposition from the local Squire (the ever-loveable Nigel Bruce) and from the ignorant masses (don't worry-they grow to love her), but still bravely ploughs on to introduce the town to the joys of Shakespeare, the benefits of arithmetic, and the charms of good grammar. She takes a young lad (Dall) under her wing and in him recognizes the seeds of a genius, so sets about gaining him a scholarship at Oxford. The picture ends on a good note with a little melancholy thrown in for good measure. It is actually a very thoughtful story, that set me thinking about sacrifice, servanthood and dedication.

Highly educated for her time, Ms. Moffat, moved by the squalor, poverty and ignorance of an illiterate people, takes pains to start up a local school, much to the consternation of the local yokels. Soon her efforts bear fruit, as she comes upon a diamond in the rough in the form of Morgan Evans, an orphan who is struggling to survive in the mines, but is gifted with a native intelligence and sensitivity which belies his surroundings. Well acted by John Dall, Morgan has glimpsed the world outside his rural village through the magic of the books provided by Ms. Moffat. It is she who is enlarging his world view. Enlisting the aid of the local squire, she grooms Morgan for a scholarship at Oxford.

Ms. Davis gives a compelling performance, as does the rest of the cast. The movie is a wonderful portrayal of the relationship that has formed between a very special teacher and a gifted student, who, but for that teacher, may never have realized his potential. Ms. Davis always plays strong, stalwart women with a cutting edge to them, and in this role she plays true to form. She is absolutely magnificent. John Dall is superb as the coltish Morgan Evans. Nigel Bruce is perfect as the pompous, but kindly, local squire who is manipulated by Ms. Moffat to sponsor Morgan in his bid for Oxford. Joan Lorring is wonderful as the sly and lascivious cockney girl, Bettie Watty, who almost derails Morgan's future when she become pregnant with his child. Rosalind Ivan is marvelous as Bessie's mother, Mrs. Watty. Rhys Williams and Mildred Dunnock are superlative in their roles of the assistant school teachers, Mr. Jones and Ms. Ronberry. This is truly a movie well worth having in one's collection.",998092800,36,1845,4.712074303405573

7818044,3,630196571X,"The Corn is Green is a classic movie. The DVD is excellent quality, but it doesn't have captions or subtitles. What gives? The setting for this movie is in Wales, and all the characters are either English or Welsh, some with strong accents. Without captions, you struggle with accents, miss a lot of the story, and it's certainly not as enjoyable as it should be. When this movie is shown on Turner Classic Movies, it has captions. The makers of the DVD cut corners. Normally, I'd give this movie 5 stars, but without captions, the best I can do is 3 stars.",1489449600,,557,4.470588235294118
