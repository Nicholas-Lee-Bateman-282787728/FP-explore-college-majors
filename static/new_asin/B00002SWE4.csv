With only days of life left, Heinrich manages to escape to the country side wanting to warn the people about contaminated ground water while the government wants to cover it up. Heinrich believes it is 1957 and meets up with a vacationing couple.

Mel Gibson has a non-credited role as a bearded mechanic, making this a rare collectable for Mel Gibson fans, should they be so inclined.

The film itself was not great, a bit disjointed, and manages to be boring during the action scenes.

7916260,5,B00002SWE4,"Dear Amazonians,

""The Chain Reaction"", starring Johan Paulik, is a sweet story about how a young man comes to accept his homosexuality.  For all of us in the gay community, of which I am a proud member, coming to accept our sexuality is a very puzzling and tumultuous period in our lives.  So when Johan sets foot in a gay bar for the first time, and feels uncomfortable looking at the barman, we can feel his discomfort.

There is no actual dialog in this film, except for a voice purporting to be Johan's, constantly asking himself if it is all right to have attractions and emotions for other men.  As the film progresses, Johan becomes more comfortable with himself, and finally finds himself added to the other characters' ""chain"" of attraction.  This film does not show any ""hardcore"" sex.  If graphic sex is what you are looking for, look elsewhere.  However, if you want to see a very believable coming of age film involving gay youth, then I highly recommend this title. I watched this film several years ago, and it led to my own ""coming out.""  As of this writing, I have been out of the closet for over a year, and I owe it, partly at least, to this beautiful production.

I hope you enjoy this The Chain Reaction as much as I did!
