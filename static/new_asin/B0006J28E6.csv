I'm so pleased that its now going on sale, and i'm definately gonna buy it.  I just hope that its not a big wait until the season 2 comes out.  Can't wait to re-live every episode again and again.

2189776,5,B0006J28E6,"Sweet Valley High was one of the sharpest, most clever, and terribly underrated teen shows out there that unjustly got cancelled after four delightful seasons when it was moved from FOX to UPN without any advertisements to let the fans know. Now, after an excruciatingly long wait, Season 1 is finally making its way to DVD!

While I wish the series would have concentrated more on serious issues, the tone of the series was light, fluffy, and fun, with just enough seriousness thrown into the mix to make it addictive. The show was a guilty pleasure if there ever was one. Great characters, clever dialogue, and wonderful production values put it above the rest. The beautiful Cynthia and Brittany Daniel were the perfect embodiment of the Wakefield twins. The show ended too soon but at least can now be enjoyed on DVD. Every SVH fan should pre-order this so the other three seasons won't take as long to be released.",1100649600,4,919,4.74375

2189790,4,B0006J28E6,Well as we all know about Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield from the beloved books Sweet Valley High. Now comes the 1st season of SVH on DVD. This DVD has some funny parts and a lot of drama but with comedy mixed in it. It's not like One Tree Hill drama or BH 90210 but it's a worth a shot.,1243036800,,288,3.8983050847457625
2189791,2,B0006J28E6,"This DVD is very different from the books. I was dissapointed. Where is nice and kind Elizabeth who always protected Jessica? In this movie Elizabeth is humiliating her sister, trying to teach her a lesson. And Jessica is just mean. The movie doesn show what a wonderful parents sisters have. And a good brother. I found this movie mean and boring. Very sad, because i am a big fan of books. They are interesting and kind. Each book teaches you a good lesson. You want to meet this twins-girls. You want to be their friend. And the movie is going the opposite direction. No wonder movie wasn't popular. And the first season was the last one.

One good thing- sisters are pretty in the movie too. Just admire their beauty!",1228694400,2,721,4.546153846153846
2189792,4,B0006J28E6,"So I was a fan of the book series who decided to check out the DVD set.  It was...interesting.  Obviously, it was filmed in a different day and age, so some of the filming was rough.  It was pretty cheesy, but I still watched them.  If the other seasons were released on DVD, I'd definitely watch them, just to see how they compare to the book series, but without high hopes or anything.  I think the only thing that kept it interesting was Winston Egbert :D",1225065600,,458,4.27906976744186
2189793,3,B0006J28E6,"I remember being introduced to this drama-comedy sitcom by one of my younger cousins a couple years back. The two main characters being Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield who are played by non-fictional twins Brittany and Cynthia Daniel. Francine Pascal created these books and the show is a loose based sitcom of it. I think the show does not set a realistic frame of life because most of the scenarios created to have a problem are all solved by the characters in less than ten minutes. It is just not this way in life and I wish the creators and directors would have taken the time to develop the characters, and thus make a better show. Buena Vista Home Entertainment did a poor job with copyrighting the DVD and did not take the time to put in any special features. I would like to know about what happens behind the scenes, cast interviews, or even a blooper reel and without these I can't give the show itself any better than a C-. If you are into a comedy-drama sitcom buy this DVD. If you feel though like you wasted $42 on it because Amazon sucks though, like me, then don't even bother.",1224288000,,1094,4.447761194029851
2189794,5,B0006J28E6,"I have been a fan of the sweet valley book series ever since I was a little girl, and grew up reading all of the books. And now, even though I'm 19, I still enjoy reading the books frequently, going back in time to the magical world of sweet valley.
I also watched the show when it was on TV, but only saw a few episodes here and there, so I was ecstatic when I saw it on DVD.

The show is definitely completely different than the books, having only a few of the same storylines in the episodes. But nevertheless, the show is fun to watch, from the hilariously corny storylines, to the bad fashion choices. So keep in mind, if you are looking for a more serious, realistic high school show (the oc or 90210) then this isn't the show for you.

The most ridiculous part of the show is during the first episode, at the the dance part where hilariously bad actors are trying to figure which twin is which, when its clear which one is jessica, and which one is elizabeth, just from looking at the outfits they are wearing.
Cynthia and brittany daniel make THE perfect Jessica and Elizabeth wakefield, despite the fact that they look way too old to be portraying 16 year old high school students.
The actor who plays Winston Egbert also his role down perfectly. He both looks, and acts, just as you would imagine him in the book series.
Two characters that I'm a little bit disappointed with are Todd Wilkins and Lila Fowler. Todd is completely different than the Todd you read about in the book. The amount of jealousy he has everytime another guy even looks at elizabeth is completely ridiculous, and I've lost count of how many times he has said ""I'm gonna kill that guy!"" I've gotta say, he's probably the worst actor on the show.
And Lila isn't a whole lot better. First of all, she looks nothing like she is described in the book. And she acts nothing like she does in the book either. I can see why she was replaced later on in the show with a different actress (I think her name is Shirlee something?) who is a much better Lila.

All in all, if your looking for a fun, goofy version of the book series, then I would recommend that you watch this show.

I was disappointed to hear that the other seasons wouldn't be put on DVD, because of poor sales. But I'm really hoping that they eventually do because I'd love to see the rest of the episodes!",1211068800,4,2347,4.327272727272727
2189795,5,B0006J28E6,This is a childhood favorite of mine and I didn't think I would ever get a chance to see it again. Thank goodness EVERYTHING is going to DVD these days!!!!,1173571200,2,155,4.2
2189796,5,B0006J28E6,"U P D A T E.:

I am still eagerly waiting for the COMPLETE S.V.H. series to come out on DVD.  It is now 24th June, 2011........and I am heartened by the listing of ""Sweet Valley High, Season 2,""  ""Sweet Valley High, Season 3"", ""Sweet Valley High, Season 4"", and ""Sweet Valley High, the Complete Series"", which come up as possible choices when I put ""Sweet Valley High"" in the Amazon search engine.  Thogh, sadly, whihever of these choices I now put in the search enegine, ONLY Season One comes up, I still think, hopefully, that these other choices showing up, presages these DVDs actually being released?????  SVH is literate, witty, and full of fun!  It has some of THE greatest repartee-dialogue, (and quick rejoinders!) on any TV show I've ever seen -- teen-age show or adult!  The stories are sweet -- the dialogue, decisive!  I truly believe that if William F. Buckley were still alive, he, too, would amire the literate dialogue in this show.  As mentioned below, listening to the COMPLETE series is a fine and easy assertiveness training course!

I sure hope the other shows in this series will be put on DVD!  With ""dross-dialogue"" teen shows like ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"", and ""Hannah Montana"" being given multiple, (if not complete!) DVD reproductions, it is truly a crying shame that S.V.H. --- with it's truly witty dialogue -- has, (at present), only it's first season on DVD.  Don't get me wrong -- these other teen shows DO have great stories....but who can stand to watch the complete shows, with that AWFUL, and amateurish dialogue around....  These other shows are purportedly written by professionals....but even the writing by so many ""amateur"" Amazon reviewers is so much bettr!  S.V.H. is THE best!!!!!  Hopefully, we will NOT have to wait TOO much longer for the remaining seasons to be put on DVD for all to enjoy!!!!!

O R I G I N A L......R E V I E W :

SWEET VALLEY HIGH is a miraculous piece of work!  I saw all that I could, when it was on network TV...and loved 99% of it!

PLEASE....CAN WE HAVE THE OTHER SEASONS ON DVD AS WELL?  I'm sure I'm not the only one who would buy them immediately?  (If they can't be put on DVD...how about audio CDs or cassettes?  As you can see, I REALLY, REALLY WANT TO OWN THE E N T I R E SERIES!

The hallmark of this series...what sets it apart from most other teen shows, (or any TV shows, for that matter), is the GREAT WITTY WRITING!  I kept a long list of the witty, delightfully non-politcally correct repartee of this show, and still have it.  Such phrases as ""I don't want to be politically correct -- I want to think for myself!"", ""Do you have a licence to be rude?"", ""Why do I need a 'sense of closure'?"", ""Other people can think the way they want, cause I don't care!"", ""I am SO over this 'selfless' thing!"", ""Everything here is just so small, and insignificant, and ugly!"", ""Too much is never enough!"", ""I'm worth it...I'm worth it ALL!"", ""When did you go mortal?"", ""I am NOT your way-average worker!"", ""It takes time to look this good!"", ""It's NOT  that I don't have a work ethic...it's that I despise manual labour!"" ""Do I look as good as I think I do?"", ""Make sure your dress and hair are right -- that's all anybody cares about.""  ""How is the air up there on Olympus?"", and the immortal, ""Limos, LIMOS....L I M O S !""....might not be what is taught in Sunday school...but it IS what goes on in the minds of (too?) many teens and pre-teens.  It's good to see it come out...for usage in dealing with real-life bullies, (""How is the air up there on Olympus?"", ""Do you have a licence to be rude?), and also to see how Too Much Egoism can lead to bad consequences...as Jessica Wakefield. the more opportunistic of the two twins in this series, often finds to her chagrin, (and the viewers satisfaction).  The kinder Elizabeth Wakefield, (her twin), also seeks fame and fortune...but not quite so much at the expense of others, as her twin would do.

  I haven't read any of the ""SVH"" books, (so far)...so I am still confused as to where the girls' parents are.  One never sees them, and they are never mentioned.  Are they alive or dead? Are they millionaires who have given their daughters their own home, and gone on with their own lives?  One is left in limbo as to this....and it does have a deleterious effect on the believability of the show.  If the parents aren't there...please tell us why, and where they are!

  I like the idea of the sweet, simple, happy-go-lucky guy friend of the girls...who turns out to come from a very, very wealthy family.  It's nice to know that all rich people are not totally stuck up.  (Reminds me of the time that Richard Nixon tried to marry off one of his daughters to Prince Charles...but that Prince Charles found Ms. Nixon ""too royal"" for his taste!
It's not money, but character, that makes anyone the person he or she is....)

  Anyway, this is one great series!  I'm glad the first season is on DVD!  And since I just bought my first DVD player, I'm going to buy it!  I suggest that anyone else who is looking for some great dialogue, fine acting, teen-age capers, and wonderful phrases for assertiveness training, and who can afford the price of this priceless set, do so as well!

  To repeat:  PLEASE MAKE THE OTHER SEASONS OF THIS GREAT SHOW AVAILABLE AS WELL!!!!!  : )

ADDENDUM:  I have just bought and viewed some of the episodes of the first season, and realize that some of the phrases used, and characters described may not be in the first season...but from
further seasons.  The very indelibility of these phrases and characters attests to how wonderful they are.  Hopefully, when these other seasons are released, they can be viewed, (in all their glory!), as well!",1153440000,7,5703,4.531831537708129
2189797,5,B0006J28E6,"I loved watching this show on Saturday mornings, i couldn't wait to get up and watch it. Alot of you may have noticed that there is no SVH season 2 anywhere in site, and that's because of lack luster sales, which isn't to hard to believe, BV is charging $45 dollars and up for a 3 disc set of 20 minute shows with no extras! that's a bit ridiculous, you would think that a bell would go off for them but i guess it hasn't, anyway SVH fans it's time to band together the rest of the SVH series is rumored to be in jeporady of not getting released so write to Buena Vista and tell them you want it: Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc./Dept. CS,/Burbank, CA 91521: you can also check out their website about contacting them through email:[...]",1143072000,6,741,4.3
2189798,3,B0006J28E6,"I have to say it's kind of weird looking at the early episodes of the series. I started watching when Jeremy Vincent Garrett played Todd Wilkins. Then for the other seasons along came Manley Pope, Andrea Savage and Jason David Frank. That's when the show really kicked off into high gear.

But watching the shows brings back a wave of nostalgia for me. It was so strange though to not have any parents of the kids for the duration of the show. Especially with the three part ""Kidnapped"" episodes, you would think the creators would include Jessica and Liz's parents in their search for their daughters.

The reason for the three stars is the way Buena Vista dropped the ball with the treatment of the shows. The shows seem very dark in the daytime scenes and there is an ample amount of grain. Although I din't expect full blown supplements, I would love to see a cast reunion and reflection for all who participated(even Ryan James Bittle, Brock Burnett and the very originally named Amarilis).

By the way, is it me, or does this show have one of the great TV theme songs of all time?",1138665600,2,1086,4.530612244897959

2189801,4,B0006J28E6,"As a young adult I loved these books, and I vaguely remebered watching a few of these episodes when it first aired, but by then I was too old to be watching this series, and embarassed in front of my friends. That doesn't mean I didn't sneak home after school and watch when no one was looking...

Seeing all the characters come alive in this very hokey teenage melodrama filled with bad jokes and comedy still makes me laugh. The twins do a great job of reprising the roles of Elizabeth and Jessica, but how people could get them mixed up is beyond me! In the first minute of the show, we see Elizabeth dressed very preppy and cute, while her slutty sister dresses like an MTV model. It cracks me up seeing the terrible actors approach the girls pretending to get them mixed up. Its obvious: Jessica is the wanna-be prostitue, while Elizabeth is a prude.

Not that this show doesn't have other good qualitites, such as bad 90's music and bad haircuts for the boys. Elizabeth's boyfriend is a stick who is dumb as a brick, but kinda cute in the 90's preppy boy way...

Seriously, this show makes me laugh, and I really enjoy the campy drama and overacting, especially on the part of Lila and Winston, who follow exactly Franscine Pascal's book characters.

If you expect a better 90210, look elsewhere, but if you want 90's teenage drama, go for this series and read the books!",1121299200,10,1377,4.496

2189803,5,B0006J28E6,"I am one of those adults who occasionally sneaks peaks at SVH novels from my teen years (although I wouldn't admit it out loud). I didn't watch much of the show when it was airing new episodes on the TV channels but I got ahold of the DVDs for season 1 and just loved it. Totally, campy escapist fun. No life lessons to be learned; no realistic charatcers; no apologizing for the high camp factor. It is such a soap opera and that's why I love it. I hope they put the other seasons on DVD.

As for the acting the only truly bad actors were the guy that pays Todd (he is so bad he gives me the heebie-jeebies) and the guy that plays Bruce. I notice they didn't have too many hot guys on the show. But I digress ...

I really liked the actresses that played the twins. They were a little too old to play high school teens but they did an admirable job. Which ever twin played Elizabeth (was it Cynthia or Brittany???) did the impossible and made me sympathize with Liz which I would have never thought possible because she always struck me as a self-righteous, hypocritical bore.

I hated the TV series version of Todd. I don't remember him being so agressive and jealous. Every guy who even looked at Liz cross-eyed he wanted to wrestle to the ground. And Jessica sure is a ho-bag.

The best episodes are the dancing one and the three-part arc about the creepy hospital orderly, Peter (who's name was Carl in the book series, I believe) who kidnapped Liz. The guy who played him ... he makes Hannibal Lecter a little less scary. He was awesome!

If you are looking for cheeseball fun, then buy this DVD!",1117152000,11,1602,4.326666666666667

I watched the Sweet Valley High episodes almost everyday... never really tried to miss not one episode when I was younger. I watched it at a very young age and was very sad not knowing why they took it off the TV. But I was SHOCKED to no end to see Sweet Valley High, the first season available on DVD after so many years that have gone by. My parents bought it for me and I love it. So far, I've seen all the episodes on Disc 1 of 3 or 4 I think it is... and its great!! I do not see why there are so many negative reviews but well, everyone has their own opinion.

If your looking for a good show, that is appropriate for teens like myself ranging from say... 13-16... I'd say its a good choice. The content if I had to rate it would be PG, absolutely no nudity, or profanity. Great show, Excellent people that they chose for the show, and I am hoping they release the other seasons because I will be sure to purchase them!!!",1113868800,,986,4.00507614213198

So I impulsively bought this dvd (somewhere else for around $20) & I just couldn't get into it. I watched about 3 1/2 episodes, but Jessica (one of the main stars) just grated on my nerves. This girl was such a tease. Plus everytime she did something wrong she got off pretty lightly. If anything she would get back at somebody else. She was also very easily forgiven by her sister, whom she used just like everyone else. Some shows like Saved by the Bell I can watch now & still enjoy, but not this show. I'm happy for the huge fans of this show that it's out there for them. However, if you aren't a hard core fan, like me, make it a rental, not a purchase.

2189809,3,B0006J28E6,"I grew up with the whole SVH series.. including the books for the elementary kids.. I loved every series of SVH.. especially the SVU and Elizabeth.. Senior year was great too. I really liked how FP pushed them into a more realistic world. And I thought it was great how the new kids from the rival HS mixed in with the SVH studendts. I was so so so sad to see that she ended the series...especically when it just got to be so great! And growing up I had everything that they offered with SVH on it. Even the board game which was kinda cheesy.. but still fun.

So when I heard there was going to be a TV show about SVH I was estatic. And I just loved the twins they chose to play J+E. but i have to say that after seeing the first season.. i am really dissapointed. I know it's only a 30min show. but the acting was horrible for the most part.i actually cringed and was embarrassed for some of the actors...and wondering just what they really thought of the show they were putting on... i don't know who wrote the scripts and what direction they were sent in.. it seems to me that maybe they tried to cover too many books in one episode. the episode that i was really annoyed with was COMA. E is in a coma.. and then.. right after a commercial she's shocked and then wakes up.. i mean come on!!! a lot of the shows were like that. i think the best thing about this show was the fashion! and thats mainly J. i dunno..im sure i will get a lot of slack for saying this review because so many ppl wrote in and liked it. i realize this show was for fun etc.. but for me it was still just to darn goofy and predictable. i won't be buying the DVDS. which i think is sad because for almost 30years i have been collecting EVERY BOOK. all editions too. i loved watching the books being rereleased with new cover art etc.. and anything else SVH. it's too bad this was not taken more seriously but the writers and everyone involved with the TV show. especially FP. so unless you are a die hard fan and like the show, or have money to burn, or just HAVE to have everything and anything SVH.. i would suggest renting the dvds maybe.. but i wouldn't pay the amount they are asking for.. thats for sure.",1110844800,6,2186,4.15566037735849
2189810,5,B0006J28E6,"i too grew up highly addicted to the sweet valley series...sweet valley twins more than sweet valley high. but, me and my older sister were ecstatic when, in 94, we heard about the show. but yeah, the networks were very confusing about when it aired and this and that, so we only caught SOME episodes of seasons 1 and 2, and nothing more. i almost fell off of my computer chair when i saw that the dvd was coming!!! luckily, i had only found out just days before its release, so i didn't have to wait THAT long.

now i am almost through the second disk...ahhh i don't want it to end...haha.

the show is, as everyone says, not very much based on the books at all...the prince arthur episode wasn't even based on sweet valley high. (it was actually in sweet valley twins.) but still...anyone who grew up reading about the wakefield twins and wishing they lived in sweet valley as well...will adore this show.

actually, i think the show is corny, the characters all look too old to be in high school, and the situations presented only barely touch on what high school life is really like today...(or even in 1994). but, still, you gotta love sweet valley. i have to bust out laughing at every episode for how corny some of the things are, but it is an upbeat and fun show...a show that you can sit down and watch when you just really need to take a break, laugh, relax, and get caught up in the scandals and drama of someone ELSE'S life! even if you have no clue what sweet valley even is, it's a fun show all the same. i would have watched it regardless b/c i love twins...and brittany and cynthia were very good as jessica and elizabeth...very beautiful...only downside is, of course, they were very mature looking, nothing like 16...made things kind of un-realistic sometimes.

and as someone else said, it is VERY 90's...it's so hilarious to have such a blast from the past with the clothes and all...and jessica and lila, the ""fashionable"" characters, oh man...at times they looked brilliant, but some of the clothes were so funny! but i love it :)

it makes me feel like i'm 12 years old all over again when i see this. i remembered more about the show than i thought i did. and i definitely missed more episodes than i saw, so it's really great finally getting to catch up on the others.

bottom line...if you have no clue what sweet valley is, then i'll tell you straight up, it is nothing like the OC. the OC has very realistic portrayals of high schoolers today. but sweet valley high has pretty people, funny people, and entertaining situations. and of course, the show centers around the sisterly twin bond love of jessica and elizabeth. you can't really go wrong with this show...i've laughed...i've cried...seriously.

and i can't wait for other seasons!!!",1110499200,7,2769,4.559356136820925
2189811,5,B0006J28E6,"I have devored many of books in the various Sweet Valley series, and watched this show wayyyy back in 1994.  I happened to stumble across this set and got it right away.  There are no extras, but the great episodes are enough to keep me satisfied.  The show definitely has a 90's vibe, but the nostalgia is part of what makes it so great.  If you used to read the books or watched this show growing up, then get it right away!",1110326400,2,426,4.158536585365853
2189812,4,B0006J28E6,"The 22 episode first season was a miracle for myself and many others who grew up reading the series.  I honestly was shocked when this series hit the air just because the idea of a TV series was long overdue.

It obviously had a higher production budget than 'Saved By the Bell' but for some reason, this series never attained 90210/OC type ratings.

Sweet Valley High  revolves around the adventures identical twins Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield (played by real-life twins Cynthia and Brittany Daniels) have while growing up in southern California. To the first season's credit, several of the episodes were loosely based on the series.

Not to be missed episodes include ""Dangerous love"" which (in trying to incorporate some book elements) introduces us to the TV Sweet Valley gang for the very first time. Bridget Flanery plays a perfect Lila Fowler because she is so scheming and ruthless.

""Almost married"" has Elizabeth invite Todd (Ryan James Bittle) over for the weekend after his parents' house is being painted and her parents are going away. Jessica blackmails Elizabeth into then having a party, but is in trouble when she cannot return the emergency credit card purchased outfit which was worn at the forbidden party. Because Elizabeth traditionally has the 'square' reputation, the idea of her and Todd living together for the weekend was a really neat plot development.

When Enid's (Amy Danles) new boyfriend becomes the spokesperson for an anti-drug campaign in ""Secrets"", she is worried. Before meeting Ronnie (Drew Bell II), she used to have a drug problem. Jessica (ever the schemer) tries to use this overheard information to snag the publicity opportunity for herself. The absurdity of Steven Tyler (even in name) doing an anti-drug campaign with such an uptight and narrow-minded teen is second to how Ronnie treats Enid. He breaks up with her, but Enid is now free to find somebody who is not judgmental.

Finally, at the season finale ""Say goodbye"" Todd has an opportunity to attend an exclusive basketball camp in Vermont, but this alternately means leaving Sweet Valley-and Elizabeth. Because a long distance relationship is a very realistic scenario for many teens and the young at heart, it made a wonderful close. We knew Elizabeth and Todd would somehow stay together, but had to watch the next season of this series in order to find out.

Although several episodes in this season are loosely based on the series, there are some errors. In addition to Elizabeth and Jessica, the Wakefields are also supposed to have an eldest son named Steven, but he receives no mention. Plus, Alice and Ned Wakefield are (oddly considering their very active book presence) never actually seen in the series, the most presence they have is an off-camera voice.",1110153600,19,2777,5.019565217391304
