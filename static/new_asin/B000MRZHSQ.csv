The movie for the most part isn't that great, the only fun twist I found about it was that they gave all the kids in the movies names from Archie Comics.  The story is about Archie and him trying to get laid by Betty or Veronica.",1305417600,,290,3.8983050847457625
8340135,4,B000MRZHSQ,"This movie is an example of a half hearted effort that actually turns out to be very entertaining. There are some sexy moments mixed with some humor but that is what you would expect from this type of film. The girls look a little old for high school but that's ok. They are still hot. Most actresses usually are older in movies like these. I like the 70's style of pretty much doing and saying what they want. They don't even come close to political correctness in this movie; ""thank goodness"". I won't go into the plot too much except to say that it is your usual high school boy trying to get laid bit. It is; however, done in a funny and entertaining way. To sum it up ""They just don't make them like this anymore!"".",1172188800,3,720,4.262773722627737
