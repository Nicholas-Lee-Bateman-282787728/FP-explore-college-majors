Destined to become a CULT CLASSIC in a very select cult!  Rush to buy this little gem. If you liked ""Blair Witch Project"".....",1415404800,,351,5.0344827586206895
8340876,5,B001T9O63I,"Brilliant, thought provoking and smart, Surviving Dirk takes us on a trip then turns it into a vicious game of chicken that never wants to release no matter how much the late fees or the size of the pimp.

Back off!  If you're not ready for edge of your seat comedy.  If you are ready, then hang on a minute, we're still getting dressed (drunk and imbalanced so please back off again).

What's that?  They're starting ""Surviving Dirk"" again at the local cinema?  Cool, thanks for letting us know.  I'm going to cement myself into the theater, be it by flesh or fireworks.  Super cool guys!  Thanks!  This movie rocks!",1295049600,,617,4.527272727272727
