1900536,5,B0000A14VI,"Funny, funny, very enjoyable though there is strong language. Chris Rock is a very good actor that can carry this extreme type of funny off without it not being a good story as well.",1419465600,,182,4.382352941176471

1900539,5,B0000A14VI,"A great film. It has everything you hope for. It is clever, well-written, super acting, and it is a feel good comedy with a message. You will walk around saying ""That ain''t right!"" for a while. Chris Rock is one of our premiere comedic talents and we are blessed to have him! Somehow, he tells it like it really is - both on stage - and in this great movie. Bernie Mac is hilarious, too - one of the elder statesmen that Rock may have learned from. Anyway, they really dominate and take no prisoners in ""Head of State"" which neither my spouse or I had ever heard of. What a shame! Anyway, definitely see this one. It is just so, so good.",1413331200,3,638,4.195121951219512

1900550,3,B0000A14VI,I watch this movie for the second time with my daughter it is funny but not as funny I thought it was when I watched it the first time. I was impressed though that four years after that is 2008 that we did have a real black president.,1464739200,,234,3.8958333333333335

1900552,5,B0000A14VI,"Had this movie been made after 2008 Chris Rock would have been bashed for insulting President Obama.  What is uncanny is that 5 years before Obama ran for president, Chris Rock did a movie that comedically explores many of the racial dynamics of an African American POTUS.",1464134400,,272,4.787234042553192
1900553,1,B0000A14VI,What a disappointing piece of crap. It's like a parody of itself without trying to be. We found it unwatchable after 20 minutes,1458000000,,127,4.565217391304348

7995208,1,B0000A14VI,I cannot support this disgusting person. Check out his 2018 Netflix special where he says he wants equal amounts of white kids shot every month and wants to see white mothers on tv crying. Despicable.,1519084800,,200,4.742857142857143

7995215,5,B0000A14VI,"Head of State is very funny and appropriate.  Chris Rock and Bernie Mac together is comedy genius at its best.  The two comedians play well off of one another. The subliminal messages and outright in-your-face messages of the first black president is remarkable.  It's weird - the first time I saw this movie years ago it was okay.  Recently,  I saw the movie again and was laughing outloud.  Which is why I purchased the DVD.  Great movie.  Chris Rock and Bernie Mac two of the greatest of all time.",1482537600,,500,4.53932584269663
