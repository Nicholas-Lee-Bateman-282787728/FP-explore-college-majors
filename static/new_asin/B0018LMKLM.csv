I've got a ton of these martial arts instructional DVDs. More than a few for hapkido. This is very well produced. It includes a ton of techniques  (far more than I was expecting in one dvd). The instruction it very good. This is very similar to what I've been learning in the hapkido classes I have taken. If you have any interest in Hapkido check this one out.",1451779200,,539,4.1826923076923075
