3916180,3,B002EAKWCU,I wish this was a movie of his life played out. The facts are interesting but a movie would leave a lasting memory.,1363219200,,115,4.043478260869565
3916181,5,B002EAKWCU,This documentary was very insightful and detailed. I enjoyed the way they broke down and explained some of the piano pieces.,1362441600,,124,4.9523809523809526
3916182,5,B002EAKWCU,Informative and educational. Very well done. Learned about one of the greatest musicians in history. What an incredible talent! Definitely worthwhile to watch!!!,1360540800,,161,6.043478260869565
3916183,5,B002EAKWCU,I needed to learn a lot of interesting facts about Beethoven fast so I could write a paper for school for my Music Appreciation class.  This documentary hit the spot.  It was just what I needed right when I needed it.  Thank you Amazon for having it available at my finger tips.  The musicians featuring the music of Beethoven in the film were amazing in their abilities.  The historians and musicologists were well informed and the information they presented was very useful to me.,1359504000,,482,4.690476190476191
3916184,5,B002EAKWCU,"This is my all-time favorite music documentary (next to the epic Ken Burns' Jazz, which really goes into a different category altogether).

One of my big bugaboos is that all too often, if not in every case, documentaries on musical acts: Behind The Music, et all... tend to just be organized gossip. I really don't care that band A met in high school and changed drummers right before hitting it big. What I want to know is what makes a Paul Williams' song lift like that? What is it about Becker/Fagen songs that makes them so bluesy and jazzy, yet somehow... bright-sounding?

Sure, In Search of Beethoven carries out its biographic chores ably, but what's deliciously remarkable is that it gives a chronological analysis of the composer's work. It talks nut-and-bolts about the construction of the music.

True, this film may leave many viewers glassy-eyed, but those folks are the group that are always targeted by video directors. This documentary is for those of us usually left out of their planning.

(BTW, In Search of Mozart isn't nearly as good.)",1358553600,,1058,4.861111111111111
3916185,5,B002EAKWCU,"This is an excellent documentary of his life.  I wish I had seen it when I was young and studying music.  I love how they combine his music with the events of his life.  Would recommend to all young music students, to appreciate & play music with more enthusiasm.",1357516800,,263,4.326530612244898
3916186,5,B002EAKWCU,"I enjoyed this documentary very much, and I appreciated it being offered for free for Amazon.com Prime members. A lot of people participated in this documentary, among them the great piano players Emanuel Ax, H&eacute;l&eacute;ne Grimaud, and Leif Ove Andsnes. They provide deep insights into the music of the genius, which increased yet more my love for his music. Riccardo Chailly briefly appears in the documentary, and The Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century has a prominent role in showcasing Beethoven's music. I was very pleased at the end to see the Orfe&oacute; Catal&agrave; in the outstanding Palau de la M&uacute;sica Catalana in Barcelona singing the Ninth Symphony. That has to be among the five most beautiful music venues in Europe, if not in the world!

I put together all the music above in a playlist in my iTunes, and that is 18 hours of music.

I strongly recommend this documentary to Beethoven fans and general music aficionados in general. I hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading!",1353456000,8,3323,4.278219395866454
3916187,4,B002EAKWCU,"I liked learning about Beethoven through his different concertos, symphonies, and musical compositions. It was a good blend of learning about Beethoven's life juxtaposed with listening to music he created at different periods in his life. I would have liked it if the film had featured more historical sites where he had been, paintings of his times, and a wider lens in examining his life.

The format of the film was largely a piece of music composed by Beethoven (played by a modern day pianist, violinist, or orchestra) and then someone espounding on some aspect of who Beethoven was. It went like this back and forth, back and forth.

I think this documentary is rather intellectual, and cerebral, and will be enjoyable for those who like historical biography mixed with classical music.",1351382400,,792,4.992424242424242
3916188,1,B002EAKWCU,"All of the above were purchased as a gift to my friend, who was greatly interested in having them.

The Mozart and disk #1 of the Beethoven DVD refused to go beyond the ""warning"" screen on the disks.

And Amazon quickly sent replacements.

===========================================================

As before, the Haydn and disk #2 of the Beethoven pair worked just fine on her VISIO player.

And as before, the Mozart and disk #1 of the Beethoven DVD replacements refused to go beyond the ""warning"" screen on the disks.

We have successfully played and re-played the Haydn and several of the dozen-or-so other DVD's that we have for this relatively-new and seldom-operated VISIO player.

And have had very experienced users come over to try to get the Mozart and the Beethoven #1 disks to play -- without success.

Fortunately for the manufacturer, the Haydn, Mozart and both Beethoven's play just fine on my iMac 27 computer.

Given that this is a repeat of the initial problem, I have decided to keep the DVD's for play on my iMac rather than again go through the process of asking for replacements that are unlikely to work on my friend's otherwise working VISIO player.

Which, of course, leaves my friend -- for whom they were intended -- wanting.

=========================================================

There appear to be several re-issues of these same DVD's on the market.

ALL by the same manufacturer.

In spite of the success on the iMac, I still suspect that what I described above is a manufacturing problem and NOT a VISIO player problem.

And would certainly like to see a solution.",1343260800,,1604,5.0227272727272725

Fantastic performances by all
A total winner ",1500681600,,71,5.454545454545454
3916191,5,B002EAKWCU,"A product with 234 previous reviews really doesn't need any further comment from me. However I would strongly recommend this for those who know a bit about Beethoven and want a good narrative of his life, with illustrations from his major works.

There are whole days, weeks and months that I feel like I live and breathe Beethoven. Even so, I am not a musician or an expert and I find programs like this invaluable for fleshing out a man whose music is so iconic that it could be a Mount Rushmore unto itself. In addition, the film comes clean in showing that Beethoven the man came with a compelling but saddening --and sometimes infuriating backstory of weaknesses, poor health, a less than convivial personality, an idealistic view of the world that was crushed time and again, and (ultimately) the curse --and blessing--of increasing deafness. This is what makes this a very human and not just a musical story.

Any musical or Beethoven ""expert"" can quibble with things they'd like to have seen done better, more completely or more musically. Whateverrrrrrr. Let them write their own Beethoven biography and get it filmed. But for the interested layperson, I think this work--in combination with the dramatic flight of fancy called ""immortal beloved""--gets at the spirit of Beethoven in a way that will bring him alive. And (most importantly) hopefully provide further urgent encouragement to explore all of his music and keep the flame alive.

Lastly, for those of us who view modern classical music performers as heroes akin to modern atheletes, this film boasts an enviable roster of cameos from the current classical music ""running set"" that add a great deal to the depth and heft of the program.

Highly recommended. Thanks, Phil Grabsky.",1497312000,,1748,4.955631399317406
3916192,5,B002EAKWCU,Excellent documentary!,1494633600,,22,10.5
3916193,5,B002EAKWCU,"I've been looking for something like giving the entire picture of Beethovens music and his life objectively in light of the contemporary background, since I'm fed up with emotional critics and guide books written from a heroic perspective that he is the greatest ever musician who accomplished great works despite deafness. This DVD is just what I want due to the great insight combined with the social, historical and musical landscape at the time and how they shaped and influenced his life and music. Also helpful are playing and comments by first-class musicians including Sir Roger Norrington, Helene Grimaud, Ronald Brautigam and so forth. Maybe overlong, but well-edited and excellent.",1492041600,5,692,5.3
3916194,5,B002EAKWCU,"This is so much more than a standard biographical documentary!  I particuarly love the insights given by professional musicians on the Beethoven pieces they play regularly; it's one thing to learn abou a piece by repeated listening, but quite another to live inside a piece for a lifetime.  As a music educator, I've seen a lot of composer bios, but the whole ""In Search of"" series is a cut above.",1488412800,,397,4.6571428571428575

3916222,2,B002EAKWCU,"Aside from uneven sound quality and sometimes goofy editing, the program was interesting as far as it went.  The story stopped abruptly during Beethoven's young mid-life, so we never learned of his marriage, children, or great later compositions such as the Ninth Symphony.  In fact, symphonies were almost entirely overlooked.

If they came out with part II we might watch it (at no extra charge) despite the flaws because the commentators were interesting and knowledgeable.",1472428800,2,476,5.32

A musician who with every piece he composed, broke new ground in music while suffering from deafness. The musicians who played excepts from some of his great works showed great passion and demonstrated the broad range of Beethoven's music and it's variation and complexity.

3916291,2,B002EAKWCU,"There was not much information and not much music. Well know music personalities were used to promote it, but the better known were mostly cameos. The documentary suggests that Beethoven was the greatest of all the composers, but without much supporting data. For example they might have mentioned that he was the first person to use music as a form of self-expression. This is really a big deal. Most people assume that music was always a form of self-expression. But this was not the case. Beethoven changed the game. Before this a symphony, concerto, sonata, etc., were, in part, rated good or bad depending on how well one followed the symphony, concerto, sonata recipe. For a really great Beethoven experience, watch Immortal Beloved with Gary Oldman, who was a fantastic Beethoven.

There is really great stuff in this but it seems as though it was edited very badly-I seem to have seen this when a number of the current musicians mentioed in the credits actually had film time (Helen Grimaud comes to mind). To talk about Beethoven without speaking about the 3rd Symphony is a complete travesty. Also, missing are strong references to most of his amazing works -no mention of the late piano sonatas -especially the ""Hammerklavier"", and the late String Quartets.

3916381,2,B002EAKWCU,"""In Search of Beethoven"" (UK 2009, by Phil Grabsky) is a documentary, dominated by Anglo-American experts (so you can guess who they think the Immortal Beloved was). Maudlin, sentimental. Poorly researched. Despite the acclaim it received (after the much better In Search of Mozart), one is left with the feeling that he did not really find him! A (still questionable) selection of lots of excellent music is just not enough.

3916384,5,B002EAKWCU,"This biography of one of history's great composers (perhaps the greatest) was thoughtfully put together through interviews with
knowledgeable and insightful musicians and historians liberally interspersed with brilliantly performed sections of Beethoven's music.
I was deeply touched by the story of Beethoven the man and how his intense and complex personality as well as his disability and genius lead him to compose the profoundly beautiful and inspiring music he created during his lifetime.  I have seen other documentaries of Beethoven's life, but none even approached the excellence of this video.  I recommend it most highly.",1387756800,,633,5.652631578947369
3916385,5,B002EAKWCU,"I love Beethoven's music but knew little about him. This documentary provided insight into the man and his music. Numerous musicians and historians provide authoritative and interesting comments on his music and his persona. The dominant image of Beethoven is the scowling, intense man who wrote some of the most penetrating and profound music in the history of humanity. However, there are many other aspects of his personality and his music that are revealed in this program. I listened to his 3rd symphony with new ears after seeing this film.",1387497600,,546,5.0777777777777775

I find it remarkable that he wrote in a diary, which has proved invaluable in understanding who he was.  I certainly don't have the time to write in a diary and makes me ask if that was very common for those times, or if any of the other great composers kept diaries.

Either way, I very much enjoyed the movie and intend to watch it 2-3 more times.  Well done.",1371081600,,673,4.491803278688525

8367015,5,B002EAKWCU,"I bought this based on the outstanding quality of one of the other movies by Phil Grabsky:  ""In Search of Mozart"".  This movie is also very good, and follows closely the format and style of the Mozart biography.  That said, the Beethoven biography in this series just wasn't as spectacular as the Mozart work.  Perhaps the difference is that the Mozart biography was the first I watched, and thus seemed more exciting and fresh.  Or, perhaps the difference lies in the different lives of the two great composers.  Based on this work and biographies of Mozart I've read, Mozart had a happier, more interesting life (child prodigy, tours to regal palaces around Europe, etc.)  than Beethoven, and was much healthier than Beethoven, until that is, the brief period before he (Mozart) died.  So, if half stars were allowed, I'd rate this 4.5.  As for the 3rd Beethoven symphony (Eroica) that other reviewers noted was lacking in this work, they're wrong.  All 9 of Beethoven's symphonies were covered in the Grabsky biography, and especially Eroica,which he covered in greater depth than all but the 9th.  I can only guess that the difference is due to the source.  Perhaps the Amazon ""streaming"" version of this omitted Eroica and other passages; but the DVD 2-CD set includes everything, including some extra whole movement performances of Beethoven works.",1520294400,,1354,4.995535714285714

I don't know why the other composer documentaries in this series (Mozart, Chopin, and Haydn) are available on Amazon in full, but this one ends quite abruptly after 50 minutes, without ever discussing Beethoven's symphonies other than the 1st, his personal struggles in the second half of his life, or even how he coped with fully losing his hearing.

8367019,5,B002EAKWCU,"The full documentary is great -- it includes the 3rd Symphony, the concert of 1808 and the 9th symphony, unlike what others have said here. The problem is that the version on Amazon Streaming is for some reason highly edited down to less than half its original length. Shame on Amazon for this -- Netflix had the full version a few years ago. It's still somewhat worth it, but it's certainly lacking. The DVD, btw, contains the 2-1/2 hour documentary and another 100 minutes of extra footage -- it doesn't have some super-long edit of almost 4 hours.",1516492800,,550,4.622448979591836
8367020,2,B002EAKWCU,"While watching this movie, I noticed several choppy edits and it seemed to end rather abruptly.  The length on Amazon Prime Video is listed at 50 minutes, which seems accurate.  Then I checked the same movie on IMDB, where it was listed at over two hours.  Amazon's website lists the DVD at 2 hours and 34 minutes.  Conclusion:  This is a severely butchered version of the original movie.  Perhaps it is the edited to fit a one-hour TV timeslot version.  Indications are that the original may be a very good movie, but now I'll never know.  Now if you just want the Readers Digest Cliff Notes experience, maybe this is the version for you.

8367022,5,B002EAKWCU,This documentary on Beethoven is exceptional. It brought me to a newer and deeper understanding of this musical genius' personal life and compositions in a way I never thought possible! The musicians' input was so interesting and so sublime.
