8274438,5,B000FJQPJ6,"When we retire we want to sail to places we have never been.  This is a great dvd about the sea of Cortez.  It is not an instructional dvd but a great dvd on the cruising lifestyle.  Sailing is not cruising.  This couple showed a lot of what the cruising lifestyle is like.

Very enjoyable, and I just bought their other DVD.",1167868800,2,325,4.17741935483871
