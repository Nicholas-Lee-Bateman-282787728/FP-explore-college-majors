5094050,5,B007KL8TOQ,I really enjoy all the 30/30 films and this one is no different.  I recommend it for yourself or as a gift!,1362700800,,107,3.8636363636363638
5094051,5,B007KL8TOQ,This is a great example of parents pushing their kids too hard.  Every parent who has a child in sports should be required to watch this.,1355875200,,137,4.269230769230769
5094052,5,B007KL8TOQ,"If there was ever any a video to show a young athlete or young athlete's parent this is it.  I remember growing up as a young teenager and watching Todd ascend from high school to USC to the NFL.  I always thought to myself what a waste.  Now, however, I realized why he made the decisions he did and how strong addiction can be.  There are so many life lessons to be learned in this documentary that I know anyone could benefit from it...even non-athletes.  As a high school football coach I have showed this film (and will continue to show it) to my players and they always tell me how inspiring it was for them.  This video can change lives!",1337817600,9,644,4.2809917355371905
8519111,5,B007KL8TOQ,Excellent. Very well made.  That's all you need to know.  It helps if you like football and sports but not completely necessary.,1521331200,,128,4.7727272727272725
8519112,5,B007KL8TOQ,"I've seen a lot of ESPN Films and this is one of my favorites. It's well edited (as they usually are), with an excellent story, and interesting and likable personalities. Don't miss it.",1514505600,,185,4.636363636363637

8519119,5,B007KL8TOQ,This is a must see for any parent that have children participating in any sport.  Sometimes pushing a child to do well has the potential of failure in the long run.,1399248000,,164,4.290322580645161

3/13: The legend of Todd Marinovich and his father is a very well-known story in athletics, and it did not turn out well for both of them. I did not follow it back then, so I wanted to learn about it in The Marinovich Project. I became satisfied with what I missed out on which was apparently...nothing. All in all, if you want to burn your kid out because you desire to live your dreams though him, go ahead and watch The Marinovich Project by all means.",1362787200,,479,4.263736263736264
