8652403,5,B00JM5C7E6,This is a very nicely done and informative movie about Hawaii. The filming is beautiful and my husband and I learned some things we never knew before about the islands. Would recommend.,1483833600,,185,4.8125
8652404,5,B00JM5C7E6,Love it!!! So interesting. And very spectacular scenery. Worth the money!!,1420588800,,74,5.818181818181818
8652405,4,B00JM5C7E6,"Up to National Geographic standards but not as good as PBS's ""Amazing Places:  Hawaii"" which gas more stunning photography.",1420588800,3,123,5.473684210526316
8652406,5,B00JM5C7E6,"This is a must see if you've ever had an interest in Hawaii. National Geographic outdid themselves on this one. I was there in 70, on leave from Vietnam, but never experienced all the stunning beauty that you'll see here. The first section is everything above sea level. The second is everything below water, on the reef. There's also a bonus feature of the NorthWest islands that are off limits to all but a few scientists.",1410048000,3,424,4.592105263157895
8652407,5,B00JM5C7E6,"This is shorter---90 minutes, but it packs excellent footage and pretty good narration with no wasted time.
Regrettably, no blu-ray version is offered.",1403222400,3,151,5.608695652173913
