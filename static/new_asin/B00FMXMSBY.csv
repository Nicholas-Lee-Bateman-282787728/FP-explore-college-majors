8617028,2,B00FMXMSBY,"The new Pac-man has redesigned him as a teenager and voiced by a female (to sound like a tween boy). It's in Pac high school, you get the idea. Those used to Pac-man being portrayed as an adult male will not be impressed, but guess the show is decent for a younger generation.",1390780800,,276,4.226415094339623

8617030,2,B00FMXMSBY,"It isn't hidden, as the record states that this is only 22 minutes long but this DVD only has 1 episode on it ""The adventure begins part 1"".  It could of at least combined part 1 and 2.  I think there is an Australian release of this under the same name that included 6 episodes.  The US release is by Kaboom.  Anyways, a 22 minute episode isn't worth the retail price of 9.99 or whatever discount it happens to be going for on a given day.",1389657600,3,440,4.0813953488372094
