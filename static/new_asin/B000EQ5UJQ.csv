2528249,3,B000EQ5UJQ,"Yet another delightful disc packed with two choice episodes from Shirley Temple's anthology series, SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK (aka ""The Shirley Temple Show""). Acting as a precursor to later series like ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" and Jim Henson's ""The Storyteller"", SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK was a big ratings winner for NBC. Temple hosted and also indulged in an occasional starring role, surrounded by an amazing cast of noted Broadway and Hollywood talents.

Both of the episodes from this disc are taken from the 1960-61 season.

PIPPI LONGSTOCKING (Season 2 Episode #15): Astrid Lindgren's colourful, fearless young heroine comes to life thanks to a perfectly-cast Gina Gillespie. We follow Pippi on several adventures with her neighbours Tommy (Gregory Irvin) and Annika (Kelly Smith), including a day at school where Pippi matches wits with teacher Miss Lindquist (Renie Riano), and a visit to a carnival with Tor Johnson as the strong-man!

KIM (Season 2 Episode #2): Shirley Temple must have especially loved this episode, as it was repeated several times during the run of SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK. Based on the Rudyard Kipling novel, the story follows the incredible adventure of one small boy (Tony Haig) upon whose shoulders rested the entire fate of the British army. Co-starring Michael Rennie and Alan Napier.",1248134400,4,1323,5.381642512077295

I'd love to see Legend Films expand their range of SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK discs.  For example, Shirley Temple and Fernando Lamas in ""Little Men"", Claire Bloom and Charlton Heston in ""Beauty and the Beast"", Peter Lazer and Gig Young in ""The Prince and the Pauper"", Jacques Aubuchon in ""The Black Arrow"", and Elsa Lanchester as ""Mother Goose"".",1248048000,2,1675,5.3106060606060606

8112953,5,B000EQ5UJQ,"My two nieces and I watched this wonderful DVD and just adored both features but the girls really loved Pippi Longstocking. Watching this brought back childhood memories of a simpler and sweeter time. If you are already a Shirley Temple fan, I highly recommend this one. She was the true American Sweetheart and will always live on in these classic DVDs. Thanks Legend Films!",1396224000,3,375,4.875
