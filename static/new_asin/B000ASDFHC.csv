2392274,5,B000ASDFHC,"""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is unquestionably one of the towering classics in the WWII genre of films, it's inclusion here makes it by default one of the primary reasons to purchase this collection. But what else can you expect with film master David Lean at the helm and Alec Guiness in a starring role?

""From Here to Eternity"" and ""The Guns of Navarone"" are both only one step below ""Bridge"". ""Guns"" is an exciting, suspenseful thriller while ""Eternity"" is more of a character study in a military environment. Both are excellent for entirely different reasons. Look for the great Richard Harris in an early (and all too brief) role in ""Guns"".

Also included is the 48-minute History Channel ""Weapons at War"" episode on ""WWII Leathernecks"" and a 25-page scrapbook. The scrapbook features a brief essay on each film as well as cast & crew filmography for the director and three main leads. There's also some production photographs along with the original theatre posters. Rounding out the book is a list of the Academy Award wins & nominations each film collected.

Each DVD is packaged in the slimline DVD cases and enclosed in a cardboard sleeve. Though the DVD set doesn't list any special features, there are a few included. ""Guns"" has perhaps the most involving feature - a 30 minute making-of special featuring interview footage with Gregory Peck. ""Eternity"" has one as well but it is less than 3 minutes, the main feature there is 10 minutes of interview excerpts with director Fred Zinneman. ""Bridge"" has nothing but a couple of trailers.

If you can locate this set locally, there's a new version released just this year that comes enclosed in a tin case. It's everything included here as well as an extra DVD titled ""Pacific Battlefront: Heroes of Iwo Jima"". It's the last two episodes of the ""Pacific Battlefront"" series and covers Iwo Jima and Okinawa (each episode is about 45 minutes). I've seen this version of the set at stores like Best Buy for less than 20 dollars.",1243209600,47,1987,4.8011695906432745

2392375,3,B000ASDFHC,"I got the itch to watch The Bridge On The River Kwai recently. I discovered it was cheaper to buy it in this set than as a stand alone DVD or even as a digital download. I've seen all of the movies in this set more than once in the past. These are three films that were widely appreciated in their time and were big box office hits.

The Bridge on the River Kwai is still a jewel of a movie. The pace is good, story is very interesting, sets are perfect, casting is good, and the acting and direction make this a movie that holds its allure. It was actually better than I remembered. I'd give Kwai three and a half stars out of five.

From Here to Eternity is worth watching just to watch Bert Lancaster. He was a unique actor with a way of carrying himself that will never be repeated. No matter what role he held his personal character far out shadowed the character he was playing. But beyond Bert the movie didn't pass the test of time well. By today's standards the movie was slow, and carried too much dialog and not enough action. I'd have to give Eternity two stars.

The Guns of Navarone is another film that didn't pass the test of time too well but it does hold up a bit better than From Here to Eternity. For Navarone to be labeled the greatest adventure film ever was more than bold. The scenes, sets, and action were all pretty good but there were some segments that could have been left out without disturbing the film. Sometimes movies contain scenes that don't seem to have much to do with the story; my wife and I label some of those scenes as ""filler"" that may have been inserted just to fill time. As the Guns of Navarone was two hours and thirty-six minutes long it didn't need any filler. One scene that could have been left out was the storm which added little to the story. It's worth a watch as long as you keep in mind that it was released in 1961. By today's standards it is lacking in action, slow, but for it's time the graphics were decent. I'd give this three stars.

The bonus disk was interesting with some great actual footage.",1416009600,9,2061,4.263427109974424

2392434,5,B000ASDFHC,"THE GUNS OF NAVARONE have long been silent but the legend of this extraordinary and endearing film lingers on in our memory. They just don't make them like this any more. The script, the score (Dimitri Tiomkin), the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche. I often have fleeting thoughts of this film, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from this WWII legend. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining yet important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war. THE GUNS OF NAVARONE is one of my favorite films and the less said the better. I just savor my memories of it and get a little warmth in my heart.

FROM HERE TO ETERNITY is a classic in many respects combining old school filmmaking with a more realistic narrative and starkness of the 50's. I always thought Montgomery Clift's performance, as Private Prewitt is rather immortal and certainly a classic one. Clift is Prewitt. A lot of focus fell upon Frank Sinatra, but I thought his brilliance as an actor came just a few years after this. This is a film you really have to see and return to from time to time.

David Lean's BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is also another classic combining good stiff upper lip heroics and an overall cynicism of war and its futility as a means of expressing the humanity of all affected. This is a great film. It is interesting how William Holden's single handedness puts the entire essence of that statement to the test. William Holden and Alec Guinness are idealistically and diametrically opposed though not seen so visually in the same frame. Yet, Alec Guinness leaves an indelible image as the inimitable British Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as the powerfully weak Colonel Saito with William Holden, the American and cynic looking in on the entire madness. William Holden's character and predicament almost seem secondary to the central plot, but ultimately the American falls into the madness. The true substance of the story lies in the conflict and irony between Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and the morality of British soldiers building a bridge for the enemy to the best of their abilities as Holden, the American sees the entire lot of them playing toy soldier with real men's lives. The bridge is central to the plot and it takes on symbolic meaning as both a monument to British ingenuity and the inept weakness of their Japanese captors.

Malcolm Arnold's score is most memorable for his use of Kenneth Alford's ""Colonel Bogey March."" This full is full of indelible sights and sounds. The unique look of the bridge structure over the River Kwai, the ""Colonel Bogey March"" and the scene where Alec Guinness falls on the plunger of the detonator box rigged to blow up the bridge have lived with me ever since I saw this film as a kid. That was a longtime ago, a time well remembered that only exists in my memory now. Adapted from Pierre Boulle's novel the screenplay (credited to Boulle) was written by the blacklisted Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who received their Academy Awards, posthumously, in 1985.",1398211200,2,3333,4.854130052724077
