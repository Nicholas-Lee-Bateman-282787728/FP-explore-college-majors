8636024,4,B00HUTPK0Y,"Steve Cohen is apparently worth some $8B and SEC was able to get $1.8B with no jail time out of Steve but some of the other small fish in the pond ended up serving some jail time plus paying some penalties. FBI was able to tap their phones which is a first when they never have done that before except in Mafia cases and that $1.8B was a record settlement. Crooks are crooks regardless if they get busted or not so this documentary would not interest them but for those individuals with ethics who want to be the next guy on the cover of the Forbes Magazine, this documentary is a good reminder that Wall Street is a very greasy pole, the higher that you go, the harder you will fall. So get ready to pay your dues since if you want to be a successful investor with respect, it requires a lot of hard work and controlling your temptations. The saddest part of all those crooks in this documentary was that they may have picked up few dollars along the way, but their 15 minutes fame was short, painful with no respect and just like any other crook in any other trade they all ended up paying a good chunk of their stolen money to their closest confident, their attorney. The same goes for individuals like that pharmacist who invested $1M and lost half of it and now he is acting as a sore loser and trying to get his investment back through an action lawsuit through the same type of individuals, another confidant, another attorney. Those guys never learn about the fact that Wall Street is much more complicated than just simply looking at a chart. Steve Cohen may be a low life investor but he is a good low life investor. He didn't make $8B by reading charts unlike that pharmacist since as he honestly claimed in his deposition, he really does not know much except how to steal.",1394236800,,1784,4.376506024096385
8636025,4,B00HUTPK0Y,"This 55-minute episode of the PBS investigative series FRONTLINE shows that the investment industry is still breaking laws and making huge profits at the expense of the private investor.  Reporter, writer and producer Martin Smith follows the case of Steve Cohen, the founder of hedge fund brokerage firm SAC (for Steven A. Cohen) Capital, better known as the King of Hedge Funds. Using info requested through the Freedom of Information Act and video from a deposition Cohen gave in 2011 from another case of hedge fund fraud (using insider information to buy low and sell high), Smith reveals the huge amounts of money (we are talking billions in some cases) that Cohen and others in the business made from the illegal practice.

The program begins with the 2010 article in the Wall Street Journal about inside trading and brings us up to date on the case against Cohen as of January 2014.

There are interviews from reporters for The New York Times, Bloomsberg Business, Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal as well as former employees of the FBI and the IRS.

This is the team which produced two other excellent PBS shows on Wall Street. It does help to understand a bit about how hedge funds work to get the full understanding of the show (Frontline does not dumb down its programs) but, even though Im a novice at understanding such funds, I was able to grasp most of what was revealed.

There are no bonus features on this DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
