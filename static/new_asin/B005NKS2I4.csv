8480619,4,B005NKS2I4,"In 1994 VH1 showed this film and it's never been released in the USA, don't know why. Here's the import version with added bonus tracks! Filmed in black and white it was a great show and features a rare acoustic set in the middle of the set!
  The only gripe and it's kind of a big one, EVERY song that plays the DVD owners had to put their watermark on it for about 10 secs, I mean WHY! Who cares, whats it gonna solve doing that? If people rip each song and upload on youtube, it will still have their logo, so what!",1395878400,,518,4.019417475728155
