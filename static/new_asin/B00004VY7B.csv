7924715,1,B00004VY7B,"What a waste of time, bizarre and stupid movie.  I tried... I really tried to like this 'odd couple comedy'.
I guess some people might somehow find the junkies, con artists, and homeless people enchanting and amusing? I am not one of those people, though. The enclave of homeless people was interesting but that was just about the only redeeming factor.

It was very fragmented. ""I know this is immoral, illegal and possibly a felony but I'm doing it for what I feel is a good reason so it's OK"" mixed with a topless woman in 1/4 of the scenes and silly fight scenes in another 1/4 (all of them resulting in a guy getting hit/kicked in the crotch), and then toss in a few ""serious"" musical/dance numbers. I fast forwarded through half the movie trying desperately to find anything of value and didn't come up with much. And the end of the movie was out completely of nowhere -- like the writers knew they had to finish it but couldn't come up with a good ending, so they said ""Uhhhhhm, OK, let's do this..."" out of desperation.",1379635200,,1027,4.457446808510638
7924716,5,B00004VY7B,"This a hilarious movie, while being realistic. The kind of simple movie, low budget that does not make you crave the Hollywood titles and $$$. Every few years, I take the DVD out and watch it again. If you can watch it in french, even better.",1293408000,,242,4.282608695652174
7924717,4,B00004VY7B,"A film about friendship, making a living only with a good heart, and
social contrasts. The oldish, 80sh look, and the ending make this small
film a great line in the tradition of ""2 uneven social outcasts who
have nothing but are reasonably happy"". I can think now of ""Les
Apprentis"" with Guillaume Depardieu.

The fact that Michel Blanc is also the director shows what a brain is
hidden behind his shabby ""pauvre type"" looks. Remarkable! OK, we've
seen it before: Franois is young, handsome, and gifted at something
(music). Denis... is a balding, skinny, hypochondriac good for nothing,
an ""enmerdeur"" (some slurs can only be said it French :)). And yet,
through the magic of cinema, we find out that they sort of ""need each
other"". Or at least, that's what they decide after having decided to
leave about 20 times only during this short film :)!

Our handsome hero not only takes care of his looser friend, he also
lies to this dashing girl not to tie her to a sub looser like him.
What's more, he didn't even lie to her about his ""CV"" like he did to
his former girl etc. The fact that they ran across while... giving a
scrappy performance under the rain only shows that... love can be found
at the weirdest corner :)!

Let us not forget Grard Lanvin. He plays just the opposite side of the social strata at Camping (2006) *he's ""Michel Saint-Josse"" a successful physician, well, aesthetic surgeon, full of money, connections, but pretty umbearable. I guess that's good acting!

Both actor being so young at this film is an added bonus, source of
some weirdness too :).

The IMDb user is right that the scenes of the hospital and driving are
funny. I'd add the ""squatters"", the small counterfeiter's's depressed
wife, the disagreeable dingy hotel's prejudices ""les putes et les
pedes""... just hilarious! Only someone who has known a bit the
underworld, and then risen, only to fall further (which seemed
impossible), and then up again, like a roller coaster, can understand
that this move is not necessarily SF, even though it may sound
difficult to believe. The ending's music was a bit too much, too tacky
American, and definitely worth taking away, or changing, after the
initial end credits. Maybe it was a kind of ironic message, but I
suspect it was only a concession. Which would be totally all right to
our characters, who did just about everything for a buck *totally
understandable under the circumnstances*!

Overall, a great film. Warm hearted, after all. Recommended!",1228521600,,2483,4.776223776223776
