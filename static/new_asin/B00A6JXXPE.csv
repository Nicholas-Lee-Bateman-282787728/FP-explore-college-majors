8546998,4,B00A6JXXPE,"If you love the sitcom, ""That 70's Show,"" you will appreciate this 10 episode of the best in the series. In this one DVD, you get favorite episodes like ""The Water Tower;"" ""Prank Day;"" ""The Velvet Rope;"" ""The Acid Queen;"" ""Black Dog;"" ""Ice Shack;"" 'Misty Mountain Hop;"" ""Baby Don't You Do It;"" ""Dine and Dash;"" and ""Eric's Panties.""

My vote goes for the ""The Water Tower"" episode as the best of the bunch. Even though, Michael Kelso falls off the water tower, Eric stole the episode when he accidentally walked in on his parents having intercourse in their bedroom. That's one of my favorite episodes where his sister, Laurie, consoles him. I wouldn't say that this DVD collection has all of Kelso's best episodes among them from the eight seasons on the air. I would have liked to have seen Kelso with Laurie, Brooke and Jackie more from the ten episodes. What about the episode when Kelso was dating Laurie?",1472428800,,910,4.6875
