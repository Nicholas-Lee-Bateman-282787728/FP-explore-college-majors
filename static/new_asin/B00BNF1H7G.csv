8571603,3,B00BNF1H7G,This movie has one of the most blatant continuity errors of all time. Go to 51:14 where the main character is talking to his father. They are outside and suddenly the scene changes to an inside set. How they messed this up I have no idea.,1490572800,,238,4.195652173913044
8571604,4,B00BNF1H7G,"Very nice film. A bit dark for sure, but the story and characters are interesting. If you're a fan of 1970s European crime dramas, this is a good one.",1477094400,,150,4.206896551724138
8571605,5,B00BNF1H7G,"I have just been introduced to this genre as it took over where the spaghetti western era left off. This is one of the classics which has not been available for years until now. Raw, violent and stylished.",1441670400,,205,4.421052631578948
8571606,2,B00BNF1H7G,"The blue ray was OK.  The sound was dubbed to english, and was OK.  Just not a great movie with a couple of long car chases, that we all know could never happen.  This is a movie you will watch one time, and than sell it at a yard sale for one dollar.",1370044800,,251,3.69811320754717
8571607,5,B00BNF1H7G,"Throw away your barely watchable Greek VHS bootlegs!  ""Shoot First, Die Later"" finally shows itself on Blu-Ray from Raro Video!  My most anticipated home video title so far this year finally arrived in my mailbox last Monday (it shipped directly from Raro ahead of street date) and looks great.  Also known by its original, and more fitting Italian title ""Il poliziotto  marcio"" (which roughly translates to ""A Dirty Cop""), ""Shoot First..."" is yet another highly entertaining poliziesco from the master of the genre, Fernando Di Leo.  It has all of his signature touches:  A somewhat downbeat yet intense sense of pacing featuring realistic characters (at least compared to the comic book styling of most other Italian crime films), a great score from Luis Bacalov (It is reminiscent of his scores for the other Di Leo films but more subdued.  There is even an Osanna ballad, ""There Will Be Time"", from the ""Milano calibro 9"" LP that plays during the love scene), and a truly dark ending which comes pretty unexpectedly.

This one is a real ""lost"" treasure because it was unavailable in a decent format until now and is the final film Di Leo did at what I consider the peak of his career after his famous mafia ""trilogy"" (Milano calibro 9, La mala ordina, Il boss).  This film was followed by some lesser but still entertaining action films (Kidnap Syndicate, Blood and Diamonds, Rulers of the City) as well as a few middle-of-the-road action/comedies (Nick the Sting, Loaded Guns).  Hopefully all of these will make it to the English speaking Blu-Ray world - ""Rulers of the City"" on Blu in the Di Leo box set vol. 1 looks terrible with lots of artifacts and artificial grain structure - it really needs an upgrade, and ""Blood and Diamonds"" is his best late 70s crime film that is hard to see in English.

This Blu-Ray looks great and doesn't appear tampered with that I could tell.  There were no issues that I noticed and I give it my full recommendation.  There are also 2 featurettes, the first is an entertaining interview with Di Leo who reveals a lot of his personality as well as some behind the scenes commentary on the film and the reaction from the police.  The second featurette is with the assistant director, editor, as well as lead actor Luc Merenda who all reveal their take on working with Di Leo among other things.  Also, there is an English and an Italian trailer.

The only slight negative I could bring up is the fact that the opening and closing titles are in English and the original Italian credits are not featured.  I don't remember seeing the ending English text that shows up over the final freeze frame of the film when I saw this years ago, but I could be mistaken.  Regardless, this is a must own for Italian crime film fans!  Raro Video has done a great job and have announced even more rare Italian films that will be must-own/day one purchases for me.  They've really stepped up their game after the disappointing Di Leo vol. 1 Blu-Ray set.  I hope they keep em comin'!",1367539200,5,3004,4.651515151515151
