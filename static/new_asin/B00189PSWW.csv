3414020,5,B00189PSWW,"Bowfire is perhaps the most unique and versatile group to hit the music scene in a long time.  All the members are individual virtuosos and all have careers outside the group, but together they create a show that is as good as it gets.  This recording is an excellent representation of the live show, but see them live if they come to your town.  The electricity of the live performance goes way betond what a video can capture!",1355529600,3,428,4.461538461538462
3414021,5,B00189PSWW,"I saw part of a Bowfire concert while PBS was having one of their ""begathons"". They were so impressive I had to have the DVD. The Amazon price was good and the DVD is a fantastic performance. If they ever do a show in Philadelphia I'll be buying a couple of tickets. Until then the DVD will have to do. I'm not disappointed at all with the DVD. I love it!",1351036800,,355,4.014084507042254
3414022,5,B00189PSWW,"A truly moving experience.  How can so much talent be assembled for one concert?  If you love good music, from classic to country, you will enjoy the color and pagentry, the sheer joy of excellent production and amazing sound.  I never tire of really good music.  This immediately joined the ranks of my favorites.",1320278400,,314,4.7592592592592595

8268990,3,B00189PSWW,"Amazing virtuosity. However, I recall the great wit Samuel Johnson was invited to the debut performance of a violinist .When asked to say some words of encouragement to the young man, he said ""The piece you chose was extremely difficult ...I only wish it had been impossible.""  When Bowfire  picks challenging pieces that sound like tortured cats, the ghost of Samuel Johnson winces.",1364083200,,383,5.063492063492063
