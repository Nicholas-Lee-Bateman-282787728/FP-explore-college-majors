7910318,4,B00000IBO7,"Aside from the fact my box came slightly dinged up (the tapes were fine, though.), it was worth the price.  The story of this energetic series is about three elementary school boys with the ultimate mission: For the ladies!  It sounds inappropriate, but what they mean by ""for the ladies"" is that they will go out of their way to help ladies in distress!  Most of the cases are headed by the ""ladies man"" (he's just really genuinely nice to females) President of the student body, who happens to be a genious and from almost royal backgrounds.  He's smart, he's talented... too bad he's only 10!  :: sigh ::  Most of the cases are lighthearted, but towards the end, the story gets a bit ""darker"".  I still recommended the series to kids 10 and up (aside from the one teeny, not so mentioned fact that one of the kids has ""two moms"".).  It's a great story, it's cute.  If you like Anime, it's good to watch.",1001376000,5,906,4.409638554216867
7910319,4,B00000IBO7,"The romanji title is ""Clamp Gakuen Tantei Dan."" It's about three rich boys from Clamp School's Student Association: Suoh Takamura, Akira Ijyuin, and Nokoru Imonoyama (the president) forms a  ""All-for-women"" detective teams. Obviously, there're overlapping  characters here too: (Akira from 20 faces, Suoh from another series (I need  the title), and Nokuro from ""Clamp Cops"", and three of them all  appear in X.) Basically, it's a silly, simple story that lacks plot.",961804800,2,467,5.444444444444445
7910320,5,B00000IBO7,"CLAMP School is a delightful anime based upon an early 90's manga, ""CLAMP Campus Detectives"", created by (can you guess?) CLAMP.  The setting is the CLAMP School, a virtual city within a city, catering to  the best and brightest of Japan's students in a massive school system  spanning kindergarten to graduate university and founded by the eccentric  Imonoyama Foundation, a family worth more than the GDP of Japan.  CLAMP  School stars the three young members of the elementary school division  student council: Nokoru, the youngest son of the Imonoyama Foundation;  Suoh, a Takamura ninja who chose to protect Nokoru, and Akira, an innocent  boy who moonlights as 20 Masks, and elegantly-dressed thief.  Together, the  three boys form the ""Clamp Campus Detectives"", a team sworn to  bring happiness to women everywhere.
Clearly, this TV show is not the  most serious ever to grace the airwaves of Japan.  For the majority of the  26 episodes, the irrepressible Nokoru drags his two friends around the  campus, saving and defending all of the troubled women that he encounters,  cheerfully solving whatever cases that come his way.  Of course, there are  plenty of gags and a liberal dash of humor, but, for the most part, it  seems rather strained.  CLAMP specializes in the serious and the  existentialist, so it is not surprising that the scenes most likely to  inspire belly laughs are those that poke fun at other CLAMP works (which  are, of course, unique to the anime).  Unfortunately, even these offer the  viewer little unless he is familiar with other CLAMP works, notably  Miyuki-chan in Wonderland and Campus Cop Duklyon.
In any case, it is not  the weak humor that gives CLAMP School it's charm.  Like nearly all CLAMP  works, whether in manga or anime form, CLAMP School has a powerful and  serious message of friendship, love, and loyalty.  Indeed, there are times  when the characters, despite their tender age, begin to proselytize in the  mature voice of CLAMP's writer, Nanase Ohkawa, and the series matures  quickly from its early, playful, almost hyperactive intensity to a  life-affirming passion that is uniquely Japanese.  It is the majestic and  moving ending that stays in the viewer's mind far after all of the laughs  have faded.  I believe that the second ending song, the most serious  musical expression of the entire show, states the message perfectly:  ""To make your dream come true, I'll give you what's dearest to me...it  makes you love yourself more...such wondrous medicine.""  There is no  unachievable magic in CLAMP School; bonds of friendship are the most  wondrous miracle of all.
CLAMP School's positivity is perfect for  children ages 6-12, though it can certainly be enjoyed as a feel-good show  for all ages.  Unfortunately, it is subtitled only (albeit quite well by  Rika Takahashi) and thus may be difficult for children to follow.  Still,  if the reader feels up to the challenge, I say, ""Go for it!""  It  is a lovely story of rare quality.
I have one small word of warning.  CLAMP traces its origins back to an 11-person doujinshi (fan publication)  circle, and, like many doujinshi artists, CLAMP focused early almost solely  upon male-male romantic relationships and sexual ambiguity.  Nokoru  Imonoyama, the protagonist of CLAMP School, is an early creation spawned in  their doujinshi, and, though, as a child, his inclinations of this sort are  muted at best, he arguably conforms to this pattern.  Certainly, the  Imonoyama Foundation, a unique CLAMP creation, has more than its share of  deviant and excentric personalities.  None, though, other than the Chairman  and Nokoru, appear in CLAMP School.  It is quite likely that only the most  astute of viewers would ever notice anything ""homosexual"" in  Nokoru without being told; still, not to mention it would be a lie of  omission.
If you wish to enjoy a wonderful anime or hope to share it  with your children, don't allow anything to scare you away--CLAMP School is  a pleasure to watch.",944956800,19,4001,5.018376722817764
