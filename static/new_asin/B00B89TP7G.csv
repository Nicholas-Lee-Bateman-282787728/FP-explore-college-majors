8564039,5,B00B89TP7G,"This is a truly powerful story of the impact of an event four years earlier on the current lives of three members of a family in a village in southern Spain. The father, fresh out of Prison for what happened, and his 12 yr old son want to reconnect, but each feels responsible for what happened. The grandmother sees things clearly, but is pushed away. Just as the father and son can't see clearly what is going on for most of the film, neither will the viewer. It hits viewer and characters like a train at the same time. There is no schmaltz here, but you will love the characters. The acting, writing, and direction are top notch.",1403740800,,633,4.372881355932203

8564043,5,B00B89TP7G,"This film touched me most deeply, right into my heart, as no film ever did before ...
A boy aged 12 lives with his grandmother in a small town. He is a maverick, having no friends at school and in the neighborhood. His father is in jail, his mother died. With lots of great expectations, together with his only friend, a black cat, the boy is desperately longing for the return of his father, expecting the basic things: appreciation, sympathy, talking to each other, hopefully getting some love...
His father does some clumsy attempts but is not able to come up with this. He is unable to show, communicate and return the appropriate feelings to his son.
One of the main topics of ""Brecha"" (= ""Gap"") is the inability of communication between father and son. Admission of guilt and forgiveness.

Absolutely stunning, most touching, breathtaking performance of the actors.
Most impressive images. Unique score and plot.
Did you like the classic film ""Pelle the Conqueror"" by Bille August?
IMO ""Brecha"" exceeds it. It's even better than ""The Return"" by Swjaginzew, ""The Thief"" by Chukhrai, ""The Kid with a Bike"" by Dardenne, ""Mon fils  moi"" by Fougeron, ... While ""Brecha"" was a 'no budget' film.",1360886400,6,1194,4.848039215686274
8564044,5,B00B89TP7G,"The film moves at an excellent pace, keeping the viewer interested throughout. It is an emotional film and it is not clear where the film is going until the end. It is a well thought through story with fantastic performances, especially from the son. The story coheres together exceptionally well although if I was to criticise at all it may be that the reaction from others to father's behaviour is not quite as realistic as I would envisage. The grandmother also adds a very believable character to the story. I would recommend this to any adult to watch, and I hope they enjoy it. There is no hint here of any production constraints which is incredible when you learn that this film was made from nothing but people's generosity. A true gem in amongst so many films.",1360022400,,769,4.62043795620438
