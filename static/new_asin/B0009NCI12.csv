8063423,5,B0009NCI12,"This is a wonderful study on Frank Lloyd Wright's drawings, how they were produced, why and how they evolved in style, complexity and substance in design. I thoroughly enjoyed this video as a life-long 'student' of Wright. A must see for any young architect or anyone interested in Wright's works. This film gives an insight into Wright's thinking and design process you don't find in just looking at his finished works. A plithora of uncompleted projects are included which are just as valuable. The film is well organized, doting on the drawings in wonderful detail and description. Well done and very much appreciated!",1314662400,,621,5.038834951456311
