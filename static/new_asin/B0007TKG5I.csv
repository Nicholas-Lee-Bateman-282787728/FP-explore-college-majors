8051292,5,B0007TKG5I,"The Rifleman DVD, Set Box 4 was excellent, very good picture quality and delivered in a short period of time. I bought a DVD on the Rifleman for $7.95 and it didn't work. I sent it back for another one and the company kept it on me and didn't send me a Replacement. My recent purchase I was very well satisfied with. I wish the advertisements would list the episodes in each box so you know if you want that DVD or not.",1372118400,2,419,4.0602409638554215

8051295,5,B0007TKG5I,I have loved The Rifleman since I watched it as a kid. And now to get it on DVD is great. Anyone who likes Westerns and especially with the added dimension that this is about a man who is a single parent it makes for good TV.,1142899200,9,225,3.8085106382978724
8051296,5,B0007TKG5I,"So grateful and excited to see this series brought to DVD!  I purchased this set for my father:  to re-live fond memories of watching this series as a family.  I agree with the other reviews:  I enjoy the wholesome ""morals woven into the plot"" and this is truly ""a classic series that deserves season by season release.""",1142294400,4,320,4.56140350877193
8051297,4,B0007TKG5I,"Just like the review by ""RLM"", my wife too, is the one that often suggests we watch a episode of the Rifleman--and she's native to Puerto Rico, never saw the series before and generally doesn't care for the Western genre!  That's the beauty of this series, though, in that in transcends the genre it's set in, offering up enduring stories involving redemption, hope, fortitude and resilience, focusion on a widower (Lucas McCain) and the son (Mark) he cherishes so much.  Show me just one positive role model for young boys on a par with Lucas McCain in today's shows--there aren't any! I grew up with this series and now watch it for the great family entertainment it is with my wife and 4 year old boy--such a timeless show indeed.

While I'm happy that MPI has resurrected the series with the release of box sets 3-4 after a long hiatus following the release of the first two sets, I wish they had chosen to release the series on a season by season basis, as most fans desire.  The problem is that they tested the waters by releasing sporadic episodes with name stars, found that the classic tv on dvd market is for real, and have been put into the positon of attempting to release the remaining episodes as sequentially as possible.  Half of the episodes have now been released (80 of 164) and MPI has at least been a bit more careful about maintaining some consistency with the episode vintage--unlike the first box set, which saw episodes jumping all over the place.  Episodes here are primarily from seasons 1 and 2, arguably the best.  Picture quality and sound is excellent, generally free of blemishes, scratches, etc.  Box set three had a few episodes which were a bit ruddy with low contrast, but my fears were put to rest once I viewed the remainder of that set and set 4.

Because it took so long to see the continuance of 'The Rifleman' on DVD after the initial two box sets, MPI has introduced superior, more compact packaging.  However, what annoys me is that formerly on the menu selection (sets 1-2), one was able to see a brief synopsis of the episode before playing it--that option does not exist in the latter releases.  Also, there used to be chapters you could skip to within the episode (4-5, I believe), now one has to scan the entire segment.  The one improvement was in dropping the rifle shot sound (""BANG""!!) when an episode is selected.

4 stars rather than 5 for lack of extras and for not releasing the series in season order.",1123200000,31,2459,4.574031890660592
8051298,5,B0007TKG5I,"This is more a review of the series in general. I've gotten all 4 sets so far and am eagerly awaiting the 5th. These episodes have all been well preserved. The picture and sound are much better than some other series from the same era that have been released. My wife was never much of a western fan or a Chuck Connors fan, but she's gotten to where she's the one suggesting we watch these DVD's instead of what's on TV. Paraphrasing her own words, ""let's watch the rifleman its better than anything else on, at least he's teaching his son morals and values instead of how to get a girl in bed."" Morals and values are what's missing from TV today and, unfortunately, they are dissappearing from our society as well. I'm not blaming all of society's downward spiral on TV and Hollywood, but the fact that there are few shows like The Rifleman, The Lone Ranger, and others, that actually have a moral woven into the plot made anymore sure has been a contributing factor.",1120953600,34,968,4.47457627118644
