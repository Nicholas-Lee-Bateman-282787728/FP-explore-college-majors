8762800,4,B01GF7CRX4,"Although this is very early Rossini, the music is excellent and often delightful. This DVD is the only way I can see and hear this work and I'm very pleased with it. The singing is competent in all roles; soprano Sylvia Dalla Benetta and bass Lorenzo Regazzo are excellent. The dramaturgy is a little awkward sometimes. This is an opera semiseria in which the situation is potentially tragic but the resolution is happy and somewhat comical. The part of the iron mine supervisor is entirely buffo in style even though he is the hero of the piece in a very serious way. There is a lot of back story, but it is laid out clearly enough.
  I don't like the update of the action to the World War II era, especially as the plot hinges on the arbitrary power of a nobleman to put people to death without any legal process. As the nobleman in question is not a villain, the plot makes no sense in its transposed time frame. Also, the 1940s iron mining settlement is not exactly picturesque. But the stage direction is competent and the plot and characters are clearly presented. Picture and sound are good.
  I disagree with the harsh comments of another reviewer about the booklet and subtitles. The background information in the booklet is translated into English and there are a few awkward spots, but except for one rather convoluted sentence everything is clear and informative. The appearance of the word ""lymph"" where ""life"" is intended suggests that voice recognition software may have been involved. The plot summary is mostly well written and nothing in the booklet is a barrier to understanding. The English subtitles are at least as well written and accurate as is usual for opera videos. Repeated text is usually translated only once. There are many excellent videos available on the Dynamic label and no one should be put off by such concerns.",1470787200,6,1849,4.732919254658385
