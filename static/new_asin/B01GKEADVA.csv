8763116,5,B01GKEADVA,"Fantastic Training Video, exactly what I was looking for, being a lady martial artist my self I like to learn new street self defense skills to help keep me safe. I love this DVD because it shows you in depth on how to deliver the techniques and the self defense application against various attacks including, Knives, Bottles, Clubs, Punches, Kicks, Grabs and Chokes. and Rhys explains every technique and skill very well with narration, slow motion, various angles and close ups. I also have his first and second DVD of the ""Gentleman Warrior Self Defense System"" that I would highly recommend to.",1465689600,,598,4.872549019607843
8763117,5,B01GKEADVA,"Great training DVD, I have Volume 1 (Unarmed Combat) and Volume 2 (Tonfa), I have been waiting ages for this one (Volume 3, Kubotan) and its not a disappointment, Its even better then the first 2 as Rhys goes into even more detail, yet he still makes the techniques really easy to learn while being very effective for the street with close ups, various angles, narration and slow motion.",1464998400,,387,4.6231884057971016
