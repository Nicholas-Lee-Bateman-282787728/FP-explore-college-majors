2736634,5,B000MLA93U,After Halloween the Golden Age of Slashers had begun. To All a Good Night was done early on in 1980. It was directed by the great David Hess known best for Last House on the Left. This movie is a guilty pleasure for me. I've seen a lot of slashers. I am a hardcore slasher fan. This is one of the overlooked ones. The acting was pretty decent for a slasher movie. Linda Gentile was my favorite character and actress in this movie. Jennifer Runyon also did a great job. I liked all the actors in this film. I think they did a good job. The movie had a lot of strong points. It's cool that it's set on the holiday Christmas. This movie has mystery as it's exciting as always in a slasher to guess the killer. I didn't guess right in this one. I was surprised at the ending and that was a good thing. This movie was very creepy. It definitely had it's share of scenes that were creepy. There is good gore in this movie to satisfy the slasher fan. There is a high body count. It has creepy characters and likable characters you care about and don't want to see killed. Overall this is a great movie for a true horror movie fan. If you are not that big of a horror movie fan I still say give it a shot. Take it for what it is a fun popcorn scary movie. Cheers and enjoy!,1393027200,7,1265,4.064
2736635,2,B000MLA93U,"I have the Media VHS of this and dragged it out last night (Christmas Eve) for a watch, since I'd only watched it once since I got it, and that was years ago.  Guess I forgot what it was like because it's definitely forgettable.  Directed by David Hess (Last House On The Left), it's about a group of girls (and their boyfriends, who flew in from somewhere to a nearby airstrip) who are stuck at their dorm or sorority over Christmas vacation.  A couple of years earlier there was a girl that died in some kind of sorority hazing and now someone in a Santa suit is picking off these obnoxious gals and guys one by one.  The night scenes are so dark you can't tell what's going on.  The murders are pretty unimaginative, and the victims are just hanging out ripe for the picking, it seems.  This is one of the films where the characters are mostly just so unlikeable that you root for the killer.  Toward the end, one of the girls seems to lose her mind and spends the rest of the film singing and pirouetting around the house and is left to her own devices as the last of the survivors make a run for it..what in the hell?  I much prefer films like ""Christmas Evil"" and the original ""Black Christmas""...even the made-for-TV ""Home For The Holidays"" with Sally Field is more creepy.  A mediocre effort at best.",1324771200,4,1308,4.371900826446281

2736637,2,B000MLA93U,In general I like David Hess's work. Aside from his image displaying the figure of a home invader/predator he wrote some good songs too. But yes he played a villain very well. Many years ago I rented this movie and the VHS was all static so seeing a movie directed by Hess was desired. This movie left me with the impression 'one person can't excel at everything' but I was very disappointed. Not because it was low-budget it just left me questioning the hell out of 'To All a Goodnight'.The music score was okay-nice to hear the good old days of analog synthesizers again. The whole confusion of filmed events in night and daytime throws you off a lot. The acting wasn't too bad but the one guy dishing out non-humorous commentary was fairly annoying...he just wasn't funny. The remaining girl at the end dancing around in her mad state from trauma wasn't killed...why?The storyline wasn't bad it's Christmas themed though it seems to be recorded in late summer/early fall. In closing this movie leaves you just questioning everything about it. This movie was just filmed in a rush-rush fashion and it just wasn't thought well to make the atmosphere fit together and the storyline. Think pancakes for example-it's edible plain but wouldn't you prefer butter and maple syrup with it? that's how I feel about David Hess's 'To All A Goodnight'.,1425686400,,1342,4.788793103448276

2736641,1,B000MLA93U,"The theme of a murderous Santa Claus is a good theme. However, having seen MANY slasher movies and being a fan of the genre, I have to advise against this turkey!  There's little suspense, horrible cardboard acting and mediocre murder sequences! This movie clocks in at right over 80 mins...but it's 80 LONG minutes of boredom!
This is NOT a horror film that's played for laughs...so it doesn't even have humor to offer. It's just BAD!
What's a shame is that Jennifer Runyon is one of the most beautiful women from the 80's...but even her role in this film doesn't make it any better!
This movie stinks...Christmas Evil from the same year (1980) stinks...and Silent Night, Deadly Night is simply okay!
My favorite Santa Claus killer is in the remake of Silent Night, Deadly Night. It's title is, 'Silent Night.' Malcolm McDowell is a good actor and that film is far better than the older 'killer Santa' movies!",1414627200,2,910,4.7594936708860756
2736642,4,B000MLA93U,"To All a Goodnight is a 1980 slasher film directed by David Hess best known as Krug in Wes Craven's Last House on the Left. According to the IMDb this was released January 30th, 1980, which would make this one of the if not the first slasher released after Carpenter's Halloween. Many knock this film for being cliched which is absurd. The basic idea for the film does take a couple of plot points from Black Christmas with the Christmas and sorority setting. However seeing as this film came out before Friday the 13th (more on that in a bit) as well as Halloween II, Prom Night and so on it isn't fair to knock this for being cliched because than we can knock Halloween for being cliched. The most interesting thing is how identical this is at times to Friday the 13th (the final act) and there's also a character named Ralph warning of pending danger. Unless somebody from either film saw a script or rough cut of the other film it's just an odd coincidence.

Apparently To All a Goodnight was shot in 10-days and true or not the one clear thing is there wasn't a whole lot of time. To All a Goodnight isn't Halloween at best its a middle of the road slasher film, but with more time perhaps it could have turned out a little better, but for what it's worth it is a fairly fun film even if quite rough. Another thing of interest is the killer wears a Santa suit and 4-years later Silent Night, Deadly Night would do the same and spark such outrage it would be pulled after two weeks.

Bottom line is this isn't a great film. It's quite flawed and again perhaps a little more time results could have been a bit better. If you've seen any 80s slashers you'll know how this plays out, but just remember this came out before the more popular 80s slasher films.

To All a Goodnight had a VHS release than was long OOP. The VHS was super dark and it was quite difficult to get into the film. I figured that's the best we'd ever get until Scorpion Releasing by way of Kino Lorber released To All a Goodnight on blu-ray and DVD. To my shock the blu-ray is fantastic. Film grain is natural looking and the print brighten things up so we can actually see what's happening. Detail is excellent as well. The HD quality isn't gonna win awards, but the transfer is very good, which again was better than I thought it would be. There are also some extras. 3 interviews and a trailer.

This wouldn't rate in my top 10 slasher films, but its an enjoyable in its own weird way. The biggest issue is the day for night scenes. It's quite obvious it's daytime, but than in the next shot clearly night. It did sort of take me out of the film. But with an ultra low budget and limited shooting days you gotta do what you gotta do to complete the film.

80s slasher fans will wanna check this out, but just don't expect a slasher classic. The blu-ray features an excellent HD transfer. Solid audio and a nice batch if extras. The overall release would make my top 10 of 2014",1414368000,14,2953,4.313513513513514
2736643,3,B000MLA93U,"David Hess, who acted as psychos in films such as LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972), HITCH HIKE (1977) and HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK (1980), takes a turn at directing here and mainly comes up snake eyes. This is basic stalk-and-slash stuff as five college co-eds spend Christmas Vacation in their dorm, invite their boyfriends over for some hot sex and get slaughtered by someone dressed in a Santa suit. Everyone is killed except the virginal Nancy (Jennifer Runyon) and the near-virginal Alex (Forrest Swanson). There's a double twist-ending that's telegraphed more than halfway through the film, so all the viewer has to enjoy is the beheadings, knifings, strangulations, crossbow arrow impalements and other mayhem on view. The only problem is the film is shot so dark that it's hard to make out anything that is going on. Most of the action takes place at night and most of the scenes are underlit. Too bad, since some of the murders are inventive and would be better appreciated if more light were shown on the subject. Since this is one of the original films to use a person in a Santa suit as the killer, this film does get some credit, but Hess could have jazzed-up the proceedings by making the killer more manic and, the film as a whole, more enlightening. Worthwhile only if you want to see David Hess' only directorial effort. Also starring Linda Gentile, William Lauer, Judith Bridges, Katherine Herrington and Buck West. Written by Alex Rebar, who was THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN (1977) and wrote and executive-produced DEMENTED (1980). Available on DVD & Blu-Ray from Kino Lorber/Scorpion Releasing in it's OAR and it stands heads over the dark VHS version. You can actually see what is going on. Rated R.",1414022400,10,1720,4.794612794612795
2736644,1,B000MLA93U,"Exceptionally poor 1980 slasher movie about a killer in a Santa Clause suit who offs students over the holidays at a girls college.

Actor David Hess (Last House on the Left) tries his hand behind the camera but he seems to be incapable of filming a halfway decent murder.  The pattern which is followed through the film is 20 minutes of absolutely awful dialogue and then a quick murder.  The murders are fast and largely free of gore.  There isn't even any set-up to the murders like in Halloween or Friday the 13th which is where the suspense is generated--just bad dialogue and blink and you'll miss 'em murders over and over and over.

If To All A Goodnight at least provided the boobs and gore that was standard even in lousy 1980's slasher pics then it might be watchable--instead it's almost unbelievably boring--ninety minutes of terrible dialogue, annoying characters, poor acting and badly filmed murders.  To All A Goodnight is irredeemably awful.",1407456000,6,959,4.852760736196319
2736645,5,B000MLA93U,"This was a really well done slasher I saw it years ago online actually.

Suspenseful intriguing funny in parts and a few likeable characters.

The deaths were fairly graphic in certain areas but nothing compared too how they are nowadays in slasher films.

If I remember correctly also this movie does take place during Christmas hence where the title came from and why the front of the bluray looks the way it does.

I found the twist well done also and it actually made sense and some 80s slashers did NOT make sense lol

Highly recommended.

The killer is dressed up as Santa Claus so yes this movie took place during Christmas.",1407456000,3,631,4.589285714285714
8169682,5,B000MLA93U,"I will admit that I haven't know about this Christmas slasher for long.  I first came to know of this movie 13 years ago when I found the VHS used in the local Goodwill store.  As I regret that I hadn't heard of this movie prior to 2004 I became a quick and enthusiastic fan.  As I was already a huge fan of SDND and Christmas Evil at the time, this movie was an easy winner for me.

I just love how this movie came out in 1980 just as Friday the 13th did and this movie in some ways has a vibe and some similarities to F13. This movie works so incredibly well with it's gore, eerie music, interesting kills, sexy scream queens, campy characters, creepy atmosphere, and most of all a little bit of weirdness for good measure.

While the gore isn't always on camera, I find the gore that is shown to be spectacular and very believable.  There are some really awesome kills as well.  Two of my faves are when one of killer Santa's victims gets a crossbow arrow shot from the back of his head right through his mouth.  Another one would be when another victim gets an axe to the face.  The killer hiding in the armor was a neat touch as well.  I also loved the cool motion effect when the axe comes down to his head.  Great gore in both cases.

The killer Santa in this movie proves completely resourceful and sports some great weapons of choice also.  I also loved the intensity and stop at nothing brutality that the killer delivers on the victims.",1514073600,,1447,4.256410256410256

8169687,5,B000MLA93U,"To All a Goodnight is one of those typical 80s slasher films. I saw this on YouTube but it looked like crap because it was in VHS quality. The problem is the film has no lighting so scenes in the film during the night are difficult to see. Finally, I saw that this was released on blu-ray and I bought it. I must say that since it's in glorious HD you can now see the night scenes that you couldn't see in VHS quality. The acting is pretty good and Jennifer Runyon makes a good performance for her film debut. This is David Hess's only film he ever directed and I must say it shows he could be a good director as well as an actor.

8169688,4,B000MLA93U,"Something bad, very bad, happened at the Calvin Finishing School (for wayward girls?).  One of the girls was bullied off of a balcony where she fell to her death.  Two years later, someone finally decides to take revenge.  During the Christmas break most of the students go home.  A few stay behind and risk their lives and sanity.  The few remaining students smuggle in some men (porn star Harry Reems plays the pilot who flies them there).  They party, breasts are bared, alcohol is consumed, sex takes place, and someone in a Santa suit dwindles their number in a bloody fashion.

This oddly titled movie follows the well-worn time honored tradition of most slasher flicks: trap a group in one place and pick them off one at a time.  In this case, even when they realize some of their friends have gone missing, they stay put and allow the mad killer to have another go at them.

The plot isn't inspired.  The acting is subpar.  But.  Plot holes and continuity trouble aside, it does have a certain roughhewn charm.

The film is unrated so wack it to bloody goodness (I assume). Extras include interviews with a bunch of people I never heard of and a trailer.

Movie Review: The basic of basics of slasher movies. People have a dorm party and some psycho is killing them. The story is a little weird but comprehensible and does have a nifty near-end revelation. The acting sucks but I don't watch these movies for the acting because I'm not a d! ld0!
The killings are neat and bloody and varied! So there you go. Another slasher movie for your slasher movie loving fat-a$$!

It's a very underrated Christmas Horror slasher flick that I never heard of until I saw it on the free channel (Why have I never heard of this movie till now?!) It's not as good as Christmas Evil but it comes pretty damn close. I wouldn't add it to my wish list but if they ever made a double DVD with Christmas Evil & To All A Goodnight then I would most definitely buy it",1432080000,,704,3.8620689655172415
