8663200,3,B00L1WJEN0,"I watch every Halloween-themed movie I can get my hands on. Many of them (especially the lowbudget horrors) are mediocre at best. Then there are decent flicks like this. It's not a horror, but a coming-of-age movie that deals with things people are pressured into giving up as they grow up. In this case, the lead character refuses to stop trick or treating and caring about Halloween despite being a high school upperclassman. Of course, the character is viewed as being abnormal by his classmates. The main theme is, be yourself and do what makes you happy. If you are mocked by others for being yourself and doing what makes you happy, that's their problem.

One curiosity: I'm guessing this 2013 movie was depicting teens from the early 1990s. The main character often takes his 10-year-old friend to an arcade (maybe some still exist, but I haven't seen one in years). Also, I don't remember seeing one person in this film with a cell phone. No complaints about that  in real life, I get enough of seeing people stare at their phones instead of interacting with others around them.

I'm sure critics could find all sorts of flaws with this movie, but the only time I ever notice such flaws is when critics point them out to me. Overall, I enjoyed this movie.",1444953600,,1263,4.654708520179372
8663201,5,B00L1WJEN0,"A small movie with a lot of heart. Emily Hagins and her crew did a great job on this. The writing, directing, editing, acting, and original soundtrack are all solid. And the soundtrack is now available to buy!",1441843200,,209,4.526315789473684
8663202,5,B00L1WJEN0,"Being one who never quite grew out of Halloween and has always marched to the beat of my own drum, even now in my mid 40's, this film struck many deep chords with me. It is not (thank Cernunnos) another Michael Bay or Spielberg flick, it is a small and thoughtful indie film that wonderfully captures a small group during this slice of their lives. I love it. Being a fan of AJ Bowen I really have to say that it was quite beyond awesome seeing this guy I have enjoyed in so many scary and intense films play such an oddball uncle character. Seeing him take on this new role and fill it out so perfectly really made an even HUGER fan that I already was and I look forward to what else he may have up his sleeve.  I enjoyed it so much streaming I had to get the DVD for my collection.",1437609600,,783,4.051612903225807
8663203,4,B00L1WJEN0,"As a fan of writer/director Emily Hagins since her first film, (made at 12 years old no less!), the zombie comedy Pathogen, I was very much looking forward to Grow Up, Tony Phillips. I wasn't sure what to expect since all her previous films, the previously mentioned Pathogen, the ghostly the Retelling and the vampire comedy My Sucky Teen Romance all have horror themes. To my pleasant surprise GUTP was a sweet coming of age story that I think almost everyone can relate to in one way or another. Tony Vesper, a Hagins regular, plays Tony Phillips, a high school senior, who loves Halloween so much he stills sees nothing wrong with dressing up in outrageous costumes and going trick or treating much to the dismay of his mother and best friend since childhood Elle, a terrific Katie Folger, doesn't dissuade his Halloween indulgence but doesn't totally agree with his go all out devotion either. Tony also secretly wants out of the dreaded ""friend zone"" with the clueless Elle and that's where the movie draws it's strength from.
It's clear Hagins clearly knowns this territory of teen angst and the struggles of not fitting in to any one category is not lost on her. Now in her 20s it will be interesting to see where Miss Hagins career takes her. She certainly has the tools to be one filmmaker to watch in the years to come. I for one hope she achieves mainstream success because you can see the hard work she has put into all her films so far!",1419724800,3,1450,4.5807692307692305
8663204,4,B00L1WJEN0,"I have to say that I was very impressed with this indie film! I think what makes it so great is that people can relate to it.  Sometimes when you reach your teen years, you tend to outgrow your friends and interests that you once enjoyed.  Some people grow up faster than others, and maybe some people never really grow up.  It was a believable story.  I've known people who have gone through these types of scenarios in this movie, including myself.

I thought the writing was good, and the actors did a great job and seemed natural and genuine.  I'm very impressed with Emily Hagins as a young writer/director and look forward to seeing any of her future projects.",1419638400,2,666,4.508333333333334
