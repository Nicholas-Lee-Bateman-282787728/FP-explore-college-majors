3959480,5,B002NM6DH2,"Will Farrell does a wonderful job in this very funny Christmas movie.  We enjoy watching it every year on TV.  My husband watches a lot of movies throughout the year, Christmas or not, so having the DVD will allow him to just that. Price was right as well!",1330041600,,256,4.3125
3959481,5,B002NM6DH2,This is a good Christmas movie. I like it when Will Ferrell assumes his chactors soon to be girlfriend played by Zooey Deschannel is in the Christmas spirit because she is dressed up as an elf for work. Also one of the funniest scenes next to him singing in the girls bathroom with his soon to be girlfriend and getting caught is when he assumes a little guy is an elf. This is an excellent movie. Merry Christmas.,1326931200,,414,4.32051282051282
3959482,4,B002NM6DH2,"Great! Item arrived when it was it was supposed to. Package was fine. Good price. It was described good. Only thing I didn't know I was purchasing a copy that was an ""English"" version.....but it should b fine.",1325808000,,209,4.526315789473684
3959483,5,B002NM6DH2,Funny and heartwarming in true Will Ferrell fashion!,1295654400,,52,5.625
3959484,4,B002NM6DH2,"""Elf"" was yet another Will Ferrel film that I thought from previews was just going to be silly and stupid.

I've learned by now to get over my prejudices going into ""Silly and Stupid"" Will Ferrel films. They almost all are that. But somehow they are also funny, and tell stories with more depth than I would ever have imagined. By the way, the same phenomena happens with me regarding Adam Sandler movies. I always think they sound horrible, and I always have far more than my average share of laughs for a comedy.

In Elf, its unimaginable that an actor of Ferrel's age can bring off the complete naivety required for a human raised at the North Pole who enters American society as an adult. Yet he brings it off the same way be brings off all of his unlikely sounding roles.

Of course, in the process the people he interacts with learn that a little naivety and purity of heart can be a good thing. Yes, there is both slapstick and (mild) gross out comedy, but overall this is a quite entertaining movie, and a suitable Christmas comedy for kids and parents to watch together.",1277510400,3,1079,4.467005076142132
3959485,4,B002NM6DH2,"Pretty good! I loved Bob Newhart and the last 30 minutes. All else was pretty good. Will it become part of the family holiday season film playlist? Probably but only after Muppets Christmas Carol, most of the other Christmas Carol movies, The Bishop's Wife, We're No Angels and the amazing Polar Express.",1514937600,,304,4.865384615384615

3959525,5,B002NM6DH2,"Buddy, a human orphan, sneaks into Santa's bag landing himself a free trip to the North Pole.  As a result, Buddy is raised by Papa Elf.  Papa Elf and all the other elves are a mere fraction of the size Buddy is but Buddy is raised to believe he too is an elf until he hears a couple of his coworkers in Santa's workshop discussing the fact he is a human.  Once Buddy gets confirmation from Papa Elf that he is a human, he sets off to meet his real father, Walter Hobbs who lives in New York City.  Hilarity ensues as Buddy makes his way through the big city and into the heart of his heartless, stone faced father (who by the way is on Santa's naughty list).  Will Ferrell plays Buddy who is a lovable, oversized, innocent ""elf"" just trying to find his way in the world.  Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.",1468627200,4,822,4.170886075949367

3959549,5,B002NM6DH2,"In our home, ElF is a Christmas favorite - and sometimes enjoyed other times of the year as well because it is so funny! To be honest, I have not really been a tremendous Will Ferrell fan, but he is awesome in ELF!

The movie starts off with little baby Buddy growing up as an elf, albeit a much bigger one than normal. As he is growing up, little Buddy wonders why he is so different than all the other elves, especially in size. When he is fully grown, Buddy leanrs that he is not really an elf and sets out on his own to discover his true identity - and this is where the main part of the movie steps in. Immature and ""not all there"", Buddy creates one hilarious situation after another as he tries to identify with his new father and family - all the while adjusting to everything that is different from the North Pole, such as real food that is not made from sugar!

This is definitely a family-worthy movie and includes a great lineup of actors, including Will Ferrell, James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Edward Asner, Bob Newhart, Daniel Tay, Peter Dinklage, Amy Sedaris, Michael Lerner, Andy Richter, and more.",1434931200,2,1130,4.454106280193237

He's a rather goofy elf working for Santa, who eventually leaves the North Pole for the U.S., where he has to cope with being an alien persona in the city. On a deeper level, the movie is a lightweight moral play on the difficulties of being an immigrant in a strange land. Personally, I enjoyed it on all levels.",1416182400,3,384,4.347222222222222

Ferrell is a hoot, Deschanel is a wonderful foil to his zany antics, and Caan, Asner and Newheart are all wonderful father figures in different ways.
The disc was new and still sealed. It plays without any issues on all of our devices, and it's standard DVD quality. The packaging was even recyclable, so once we shuffled the disc into our DVD Binder we recycled the original case with everything else. In short, great film, great product.
