5130099,2,B00843TZJ2,"This is all speculation of course since the DVD hasn't come out yet, but if it's anything like what I have seen live of late from these guys, don't bother with it. I was a huge fan for many years. Probably longer than I care to remember, but it's time for them to give it up.
Most notably Steven Stills. His voice is shot. There is no way around trying to hide it. It's just gone. And Davids' isn't too far behind. They certainly aren't the only ones that should give it up. Paul McCartney comes to mind, but this is about CSN.

5130120,5,B00843TZJ2,"I was aware of the reviews of this product before I bought it, but I purchased it anyway. I've been listening to CSN for 45 years, own most of their music and dvd's, so I knew the probability of a nostalgia show, badly done. I'll tell you right now if you're a fan at all you're gonna want this, more , you're gonna need this. It's a great deal and you will be pleasantly surprised. It might be the last, best of CSN. As far as I'm concerned, Stills in particular, as long as the voices are recognizable, and their hitting the notes that count in a pleasant way, that's good enough, if you're looking for perfection listen to the albums. They are obviously enjoying it, and they feed off the enthusiastic audience. Sure, they're not in their prime anymore, but who is. It takes a lot of courage to get onstage for a two hour show under the spotlight and perform up to their standards but thats what they do. Needless to say the band is really tight and produce just the right platform for CSN to concentrate on the songs. I was hesitant but I now say buy it, enjoy it, and be glad we have this document for future enjoyment and inspiration. Crosby/Nash is also a great dvd and I suggest buying it as a companion volume. Waiting for a CSNY reunion concert but what's new, some things never change. David Crosby you need to apologize to Neil and Darryl Hannah and do whatever it takes, before it's too late, to make things better between you and Neil and get on with a CSNY reunion if that's even possible anymore. David, shame on you for your vicious comments. Wake up!!! Make up!!!  Get back to whats important while you still have a chance, slight as it may be. And for the record Stills looks and sounds better by far than in recent years and I would have bought this just to see Stills rock out again.",1416268800,7,1804,4.321533923303835
5130121,5,B00843TZJ2,I haven't watched this yet but I have always loved their harmonies. Seeing this comprehensive set on Amazon was the perfect alternative to attending concert.

5130132,5,B00843TZJ2,"Anyone reading some of these reviews could be forgiven for thinking that there are a lot of incredibly unrealistic people reviewing for Amazon.

Newsflash: these guys have paid their dues and they have voices that prove it.  You want pristine harmonies and flawless vocals - fine: listen to the original albums. They were great and still are.

The fact is, this is a DVD for people who love the music and who like to listen to the voices of experience.  There is beauty in a sometimes ragged tone, a missed note, a strained voice - particularly when it's in the context of some of the greatest songs of the rock era.  If you can't hear that - if your ears are too dull to catch it - then pass this one up.

For those of us lucky enough to have better ears than those - grab this DVD.  It's an emotional experience and a life-enhancing one.  Just watch when Stills hits *that* note on 'Suite: Judy Blue Eyes' - the look on his face, the triumphant gesture Nash makes, Crosby's look of pride at his old friend...

Not to be missed.",1397260800,2,1029,4.345549738219895

Yeah, the harmonies are off a bit, and Steven in particular has lost some of his voice, and Graham still gets a bit ""preachy"", but hey, give them a break!  Some of the tunes still sound pretty good.  I think any real CSN fan should have it.  We don't know how many more they are likely to make!",1394323200,,364,3.8783783783783785

5130138,5,B00843TZJ2,"These guys just keep getting better  and better. I saw them 35 yrs ago as well as on this tour. When I left the concert I thought, ""man, I wish I could get a recording of them live, now!"" Who knew it was in the making?! Thanks!",1391126400,2,227,3.8297872340425534
5130139,5,B00843TZJ2,"Incredible harmony of CSN sings loudly and sustainably. What a privilege to be alive with the lyrics, music and times! Their voices don't have the range, but the effort and meaning comes through very clear. This is classic CSN.",1390262400,2,227,4.846153846153846
5130140,3,B00843TZJ2,"It's not just Stephen's voice that's problematic here.  Both David and Graham exhibit weaknesses individually, but more to the point it's their blend that just doesn't make it for a good portion of the show.  This is even sadder given that they had three more singers behind them providing additional vocal power.  I personally thought that they were best on the quieter stuff, and not very good at all vocally on the uptempo pieces.  I think I would also have assign big-time blame to whomever mixed their voices for this release.  Not a very good job.  I think some of the vocal shortcomings could have been modified or even almost eliminated with a better mix.

One must remember that we're talking about three seventy-year old voices that have been doing this for fifty-ish years.  I frankly was kind of surprised they still put this out after listening to the final product.  Shortly after this I put on ""The Acoustic Concert"" DVD, recorded 21 years earlier in San Francisco.  That's how I want to remember the CSN live vocal blend.  I'm sure all three of them still have a lot to contribute to the world of music in the future, but maybe they should just keep it in the studio and dispense with still trying to capture it on stage.",1386460800,,1237,4.602739726027397
5130141,5,B00843TZJ2,"It's great to see this group together through so many years.  They are not as young as they once were, but those of us who remember them when are no spring chickens either.  Perhaps not at top physical form now, they show a depth of feeling that maturity contributes.  I find it interesting that in so extremely youth oriented a culture, talent and maturity still sell well.",1386115200,,374,4.552238805970149
5130142,5,B00843TZJ2,"This combo set was great in that you not only get to hear the trio, but you get to see them put down vocal harmonies that are truly special. I'd recommend this to any CSN fan.",1382832000,,175,3.888888888888889

5130144,4,B00843TZJ2,"We can't compare CSN show when they are in 1960's up to 1980's. Related to their age, they can't reach the top pitch level they used to do. But they are still harmonized for their age, beside I still enjoy their harmony.

5130146,4,B00843TZJ2,"Old, but unique.  No one since CSN has been able to produce a similar harmonic style.  Vocals not as good as decades ago but still highly enjoyable.  This may well be their last concert tour so DVD is highly collectable.",1378771200,,220,4.45
5130147,5,B00843TZJ2,If you bought the DVD + 2CD copy thinking you purchased a Blu-ray Version you better take a closer look because there is no Blu-ray copy the only way your going to get a true Blu-Ray disc is to purchase the it all by itself.,1378339200,,224,4.0
5130148,4,B00843TZJ2,"I cannot believe that everyone is watching and listening to the same DVD?  I think that this performance is marginally short of remarkable mostly because Stills' voice isn't what it used to be, but I don't think it is shot! Hell, even Sinatra had issues later on in his career.  About the only rock and roll vocalist who hasn't lost much in the aging process is Roger Daltrey, because he took care of himself.  Stills didnt.

The harmonies for the most part are nice and tight.  Stills' playing is hot!  Nash and Crosby are awesome.  And the band is just excellent.  Some great organ licks, and the lap steel on Learn to Live is simple but elegant.  I agree with Crosby, Learn to Live is probably Stills' best tune.  Crosby himself wasn't a slouch when he wrote Cut My Hair which is probably the only disappointment since it evidently was not played that evening.  Other high points are the Carry On/Questions opener, Wooden Ships and Guinever.  What makes this evening so special is that they genuinely appear to be enjoying playing together.  Attitude, in my opinion, is a big factor if a band is going to have to together on any given evening.

I would have preferred a little more bass on the production side of the DVD.  Otherwise I agree with the reviewer who is irritated that it is not surround sound, therefore four stars.",1376697600,,1331,4.580508474576271

5130150,5,B00843TZJ2,"Review number 83. Gig took place and recorded live on April 22, 2012 at the Performing Arts Center in San Luis Obispo, California. Although I haven't seen Crosby, Stills & Nash perform live yet - I've always appreciated their work since I was like maybe in the sixth grade. With this 2-CD / DVD release of their 2012 tour - I was thoroughly convinced that these veterans (for the most part) still have it. Tunes that managed to bring back to mind some precious memories include ""Carry On / Questions"", ""Long Time Gone"" (used to love hearing this on our classic rock radio station), ""Southern Cross"", ""Deja Vu"", the beautiful ""Wooden Ships"", ""Teach Your Children"" and ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes"". Then there are the two Buffalo Springfield songs ""Bluebird"" and the must-hear ""For What's It's Worth"". Plus, I didn't mind taking in their new material like ""Almost Gone"", the somewhat inspiring ""Radio"" and ""As I Come Of Age"". Heard that '2012' has been shown on the Palladia Channel with limited commercial interruptions. Highly recommended.",1375315200,,1034,4.948275862068965

5130162,4,B00843TZJ2,"I saw pretty much the same CS&N concert last summer and thoroughly enjoyed it. They were very engaging and they were not just phoning it in like say Van Morrison. I had very low expectations and went because they were one of the few groups left that were on my ""bucket list"" and wanted to bring my young son. A few months before that I saw Stephen Stills play in a small 500 seat venue and was lucky enough to be in the front row. Stephen is pretty much deaf and that's why his voice is so bad despite using hearing aids. He jokes about it during the show. When people call out requests he says, ""yell all you want. I can't hear you anyway."" Nonetheless, he is still one of the greatest guitarists alive and its worth it just to see him ply his craft. He barely gets a chance to show his chops on this DVD/CD, but he can definitely still bring it. Anyone who goes to see groups of this vintage and expects them to sound like they did 40 years ago is being unrealistic. It's not like you can't sample the songs on Amazon or I-Tunes before you buy it so the quality of their voices shouldn't be a surprise. Go back and listen to 4-Way Street. They sounded even crappier live then!",1362960000,3,1178,4.1938325991189425

5130167,4,B00843TZJ2,"Hi,
I bought this for my brother as a Christmas present, which I gave to him a couple days after his girlfriend had already given him the same gift, so he immediately ""re-gifted"" it to me.  No problem with that!

I love the whole package except for a couple things:
-My musical hero Stills starts out a little bit vocally flat and I'm surprised this wasn't ""fixed"".  It only took a few songs for him to hit his stride vocally, so obviously it's not like a couple little, flattering ""tweaking"" here and there at the first portion of the show would have been that big a deal artistically, and I like to believe the majority of musical purists wouldn't have been too terribly bugged.

-More importantly, overall I found the sound a bit heavy on the mid to low mid range and I have to EQ the crap out of it to get any ""Oomph"" in the very low and very high end.  Especially considering the stellar quality of musical talent of all on stage, this is a shame.  Whoever did the sound for Stills Live At Shepherd's Bush did a much better job at the EQ mix and the person who produced the sound on this package would do well to study that previous work.

All that whining aside, these late 60-year-olds sound pretty damn good! I very much enjoyed most of their more recent material, the backing band is killer with a very serious nod to rising star Shane Fontayne on back-up guitar, and if you're a CSN fan and don't hear this set I pity you and I wish the Good Lord will have mercy on your soul.

Please guys except the inevitable and retire. Before you crash and burn. I would never listen again if it was a concert price I paid and not just a DVD. The only example I can give that suits the situation is a police officer should retire before he shoots the teller instead of the robber because he cannot see to aim the gun at the right person. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD, listen to the music of the past and be happy. They were a fantastic group and hopefully you can hold that memory and not the one I now have listening to this DVD. P.S. I only listened to two songs before I shut it off.",1356307200,2,742,3.9205298013245033
5130170,3,B00843TZJ2,"I saw a clip of this DVD/CD package.  Being a long time CSN and Stills fan, I bought it.  Stills still has his chops on his guitar.  Yes I agree with many that his voice isn't what it once was.  Time, and bad choices have taken their toll on his voice.

Graham Nash tries to do his best with vocals but I find his voice too over the top.  It's too nasally and whiney to me.
But this is why you have 4 other people there to help with vocals.  The Band was tight for sure.

I see that Crosby had to have his son along for the ride.  James Raymond is a fine musician in his own right of course.  But he needs to step into his own limelight.
In closing I know that this whole affair /DVD are produced by Nash and that is why his vocals overtake every ones.

Nash knows that had it not been for Crosby and Nash, he would have been still been singing Carrie Ann at some oldies show

One of the best harmonizing trios ever and NO DTS High Definition Master recording is a disappointment.  Still, it is well recorded just compressed.

5130174,2,B00843TZJ2,"There are some true high points in this set and it is amazing that these guys are still doing it at all after all these years.  Individually, David and Graham's voices sound pretty good.  Stephen sounds like Stephen and has solid moments, but in general seems to lack the control to make his voice do what he wants.  I purchased this set because I wanted a memory of seeing CSN a couple of summers ago at the Greek Theatre in LA.  Bottom line, the musicianship is still there, but the harmonies are just not that strong.  There are rocking, beautiful and poignant moments, but the guys sometimes (vocally) sound almost lost and are often tentative.  I'm a two channel guy, so the lack of any multichannel mixes doesn't bother me.  I had to purchase the set from best Buy to get the Blu Ray with the 2-CD's of the show.  Lastly, while I understand that much of CSN's music is rooted in social change, Graham's commentary and a few of the more 'in your face' tunes wore thin for me before I'd even heard them once.  If you've seen CSN live, you know what you are getting with Graham, but to include some of these tunes at the expense of classics like like ""Almost Cut My Hair"" (a highlight of the Greek show) is unfortunate.  Otherwise, a solid 3 star set, but only for true fans and completists.",1354233600,8,1294,4.399159663865547

Well worth buying - Recommended highly to fans of CSN.",1353715200,5,394,4.266666666666667
5130177,3,B00843TZJ2,"I probably will be repeating what many other reviewers have said but I'll add my thoughts.  First of all, Crosby, Stills and Nash (and Young) are....or should I say were...an iconic musical group of the folk rock age.  I grew up listening to them having several of their albums, listening to their beautiful melodies and forthright lyrics which are considered classic by anyone's musical standards.

  The voices of these once angelic-like harmonious geniouses are gone.  I almost feel embarrassed for them as I listen to them try to recreate the harmonies which were so adored in the past.  In all due respect to Stephen Stills, his voice sounds the worst which unfortunately brings down Graham Nash and David Crosby.  When he sings solo, he sounds a little better, but not much.  But the bad doesn't end with Stills.  Nash sounds a little better but his harmonizing sounds off at times also.  Crosby sounds the best and he seems to carry the others which otherwise would have been like listening to karaoki on a cruise ship.  Believe me, this pains me to be this negative and I kind of feel guilty with this review knowing how much I loved them and still do.

Having said all that, the music of CSN speaks for itself and the band does a great job with every song.  No complaints regarding the musicians and production!  But the good stops there.  As a reviewer said, this live recording should not be your first CSN listening experience.  What a shame!  It's almost like watching an athlete who instead of retiring, continued on way too long which diminshed their greatness.  Only a long time fan of CSN (+ Y) will know how truly awesome this group is and will forever be.  I just hope they won't be judged by this live performance.

Note:  This is a review of the 2 cds only, not the dvd which I have yet to see.  I'm hoping that watching them perform will put me in a much better frame of mind and will once again recognize their greatness so deserving of CSN.

Update:  I watched the dvd!  For some magical reason I was hoping that their voices would sound better.  Sorry to say that they don't.",1353456000,11,2100,4.545454545454546

Please don't let this be the first time your kids or grandkids hear these guys.  I saw them in concert two years ago, and they were great, but my wife and I both commented on how weak their voices and harmonies were getting. Seeing them live and being wrapped up in the concert atmosphere it was fun, but listening to this cd would be painful for anyone who doesn't love them.
At first I rated this cd OK, but I had to change it to two stars because I would not want to mislead anyone into purchasing it. There are great albums out there. CSN and DejaVu are classics.  If you want live ""Four Way Street"".
The redeeming value for me is hear Suite Judy Blue Eyes, when we saw them in concert we couldn't believe it when they didn't do it.

After reading some negative reviews about Steven Stills' vocals on this DVD, I was expecting to hear an old rocker who had lost it.  Some of the reviews almost prevented me from my purchase. I purchased the Blu-ray version. Steven Stills rewarded me with his gravelly vocals and guitar playing while David Crosby and Graham Nash were also excellent. Crosby's vocals were melting and Nash's musical gift is the same as 20 years ago. This DVD will make you smile.  Sit back and have a cocktail and turn the volume up a little bit and enjoy.

5130186,5,B00843TZJ2,"I've seen CSN often over the past 40-odd years, and I saw this 3+-hour-long tour last June in Providence.  It's their best show yet, and this self-recorded DVD captures it splendidly.

As always, they've worked up enough clever new changes in the arrangements to keep even the most familiar hits sounding fresh.  There's also some relatively UNfamiliar material, all of it great. David and Graham each contribute a terrific new song, evocative of their best work.  Their songs are always ABOUT something.

Yes, as some out there have whined, Stephen's voice is not quite what it once was--unlike David and Graham, whose voices just keep getting smoother--but the slight damage is only the kind of weathering that makes a voice MORE emotionally appealing, more poignant, like Billie Holiday's on LADY IN SATIN, and Stephen solidly nails every note, at both the high and low ends of his range.  ""As I Come Of Age"" is particularly moving.  And dear God, his guitar-playing this tour is superlative, even by his own standards.  He's gotten his second wind, and it has fanned him into flame.  As Graham says in the interview segment, Stephen always comes to party--but he seems to be having a better than usual time at THIS party.

I especially enjoyed the interviews with the band and road crew.  I loved, for instance, having a close look at the famous ""`Wooden Ships' guitar,"" and getting to know Rance Caldwell, Jerry Fox, Will Nash, Crook Stewart, Ian Ayler, ""Coach"" Sexton, Mason Wilkinson, David Wells and the others who make that awesome spectacle look easy.  It is obvious that to a man, they don't just respect CS&N, they love them.  Well they might.  Offhand, I can't think of any other act that has ever thought to give airtime to their road crew and managers on the DVD.

And God, it's great to see/hear the three of them romp through the insanely difficult ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes"" together as effortlessly as if they were still in their twenties!  It's worth remembering that two of them are Sixties Survivors twice over, having survived both THE and THEIR sixties.

They sounded fine after all these years, and even though they didn't perform Suite: Judy Blue Eyes when we saw them live, they did on this DVD.  It was worth it just for that.  I think they were doubtful that they could do some of these songs, and it was touching to see how the younger band members supported them.

Ok, so let's tweek the center channel to smooth them out and bring them up front a bit more. Never happen. This bluray is only a 2 channel mix, so there are NO controls for center channel balance.

That's what 5.1 surround sound is meant to reproduce for us in our lounge room.  Why rip us off with a stereo mix only?  I've seen CSN live in Melbourne twice recently and loved the concerts.  What a disappointment to find that the whole concert ambience and surround sound has been lost because some cheap-scate sound engineer wanted to save a few bucks and save a few hours to get to the bar sooner.

5130200,3,B00843TZJ2,"I was a huge fan of Crosby, Stills, and Nash (and sometimes Young) beginning with their 1969 debut album. I attended several concerts and bought everything the guys recorded together and apart up to ""CSN"" (1977). Then, for several reasons, CSN's music began to grate on me and I generally stayed away, although I've retained a strong interest in the music of Crosby and his preceding band, the Byrds.

CSN has been touring every summer for several years and I've caught a few shows. I attended their concert in Rochester N.Y. in 2009 and was disappointed that half of the tunes were from their aborted covers album. I didn't pay all that scratch to hear covers. They scheduled another appearance in Rochester as part of their 2012 summer tour and I considered attending but opted out when I heard about this DVD package. Why pay $120 for two concert tickets when I could see the same show on DVD for $20?

Overall, I enjoyed this DVD. The guys play most of the big hits with some solo material, a sprinkling of new songs, and a couple of Buffalo Springfield tunes. The 5-piece back-up band (organ, drums, bass, guitar, keyboards) is tight. The venue is great (recorded at The Performing Arts Center, San Luis Obispo, CA, 4/22/12) and the editing and sound are very good. Sixty-seven-year-old Stills, ranked #47 in Rolling Stone's latest 100 Greatest Guitarists list, shows he can still play at a high level but he has lost quite a bit of vocal range. It's also evident, and I'll put this as kindly as I can with all due respect to a great musician, that he struggles with his enunciation as a result of dental work. Several years ago there were even rumors floating around that he had suffered a stroke because of his elocution difficulties but I can remember seeing signs of the problem way back in a 1991 Bob Costas interview. His hearing loss no doubt compounds the issue. However, seventy-one-year-old Crosby and a spry seventy-year-old Nash can still sing up a storm. Their spine-tingling harmonic crescendo at the end of Guinnevere is worth the price of the DVD alone. I'm not a huge fan of Nash's in-your-face social sermonizing, one of the reasons I originally lost interest in the group. Anyone remember his ""...rules and regulations, who needs them?..."" from ""Chicago""? I'll bet Nash has made damn sure his accountants took advantage of every rule and regulation over the years. Nash has made a very comfortable living out of criticizing the ""establishment"" and then retreating back to his lovely fan-financed mansion in Encino and now, in the exclusive North Shore neighborhood of Kauai, Hawaii. His new song, ""Almost Gone,"" which glorifies Bradley Manning, the troubled Army private who passed classified military documents to WikiLeaks, is downright nauseating. Crosby definitely got squeezed out of this concert with the lion's share of the songs written by Stills and Nash. He only has one song in the entire second set. The concert's final encore, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, is an absolute joy to watch and listen to even though we all can sing the song backwards in our sleep.

The DVD features a highly edited interview segment in which CSN individually gush over each other. But anyone who has kept pace with CSN knows Crosby and Nash tolerate Stills for business reasons only.

Fans of CSN will appreciate this DVD very much. Let's face it, how much more time is left for these guys to be able to perform together? Too bad Crosby, Roger McGuinn, and Chris Hillman couldn't get together for one last go 'round as the Byrds. We're only three years away from that band's 50th anniversary but McGuinn won't be persuaded even then. And why couldn't someone have put together a DVD of one of the 2011 Buffalo Springfield concerts? Neil Young probably put the kibosh on that.

However, there's nothing here that sounds nearly as good, or as fresh, as these guys in their prime. The new songs are nice, but mostly forgetable. Crosby's and Nash's voices still sound good, but have definitely aged, while Stills' voice is personable, but muted. The backing band is every bit as professional as might be expected. Stills' finds some room for very expressive guitar work, but certainly not as often as for his solo performances. I prefer this to the choppy, but likeable, Deja Vu Live, but certainly not to any of their live performances from the 70s & 80s, or to Stills' Live at Shepherd's Bush.

5130208,5,B00843TZJ2,My only Beef is no 5.1 sound. But just what I expected from C.S.N.Anyone expecting them to sound like the 4 way street era is a fool. They are a band that plays for the moment. A Jam type band that will sound different each time you see or here them. Being a musician myself I like that. I don't want to hear songs EXACTLY AS THEY SOUNDED IN THE STUDIO.If you want that go see one of todays million dollar lip sync stars like Madonna or whatever. I'll take old sometimes out of tune harmony singing because it is real. They could have done like many others do today and cleaned it up in the studio but there is Nothing worse than a live DVD Or C.D. that has been touched up in the studio to fix all the flaws. Kudos to the fellas. Seniors and still kicking.,1344297600,4,757,4.087248322147651
5130209,1,B00843TZJ2,"It's hard to believe that Crosby Stills and Nash would have the audacity to put out another live recording of songs that they've put out before as live recordings . It's obvious the Crosby Stills and Nash have no respect for the American public. It's very clear that Crosby Stills and Nash firmly believe that you can sell the American public just about anything. They clearly have not written a decent song in years which explains why they continue over and over and over again to repackage decent songs that they wrote over 30 years  and clearly try to push down the throat of the music buying public. But there are people out there that will spend money on something as wasteful as this,as  if they feel an obligation to support them.
Yet when you look around the world there is so much one can do with with one's money that's more meaningful than buying something as wasteful as this.
It's clear that Crosby stills and Nash have big egos to maintain and they rely on those around them as well as the music buying public to maintain those big egos. But the question still remains what has success done for them in regards to their lives and  the great songwriting talent that they once had that has now clearly faded away?",1343865600,3,1225,4.509009009009009
5130210,3,B00843TZJ2,"I was a huge fan of Crosby, Stills, and Nash (and sometimes Young) beginning with their 1969 debut album. I attended several concerts and bought everything the guys recorded together and apart up to ""CSN"" (1977). Then, for several reasons, CSN's music began to grate on me and I generally stayed away, although I've retained a strong interest in the music of Crosby and his preceding band, the Byrds.

CSN has been touring every summer for several years and I've caught a few shows. I attended their concert in Rochester N.Y. in 2009 and was disappointed that half of the tunes were from their aborted covers album. I didn't pay all that scratch to hear covers. They scheduled another appearance in Rochester as part of their 2012 summer tour and I considered attending but opted out when I heard about this DVD package. Why pay $120 for two concert tickets when I could see the same show on DVD for $20?

Overall, I enjoyed this DVD. The guys play most of the big hits with some solo material, a sprinkling of new songs, and a couple of Buffalo Springfield tunes. The 5-piece back-up band (organ, drums, bass, guitar, keyboards) is tight. The venue is great (recorded at The Performing Arts Center, San Luis Obispo, CA, 4/22/12) and the editing and sound are very good. Sixty-seven-year-old Stills, ranked #47 in Rolling Stone's latest 100 Greatest Guitarists list, shows he can still play at a high level but he has lost quite a bit of vocal range. It's also evident, and I'll put this as kindly as I can with all due respect to a great musician, that he struggles with his enunciation as a result of dental work. Several years ago there were even rumors floating around that he had suffered a stroke because of his elocution difficulties but I can remember seeing signs of the problem way back in a 1991 Bob Costas interview. His hearing loss no doubt compounds the issue. However, seventy-one-year-old Crosby and a spry seventy-year-old Nash can still sing up a storm. Their spine-tingling harmonic crescendo at the end of Guinnevere is worth the price of the DVD alone. I'm not a huge fan of Nash's in-your-face social sermonizing, one of the reasons I originally lost interest in the group. Anyone remember his ""...rules and regulations, who needs them?..."" from ""Chicago""? I'll bet Nash has made damn sure his accountants took advantage of every rule and regulation over the years.  Nash has made a very comfortable living out of criticizing the ""establishment"" and then retreating back to his lovely fan-financed mansion in Encino and now, in the exclusive North Shore neighborhood of Kauai, Hawaii. His new song, ""Almost Gone,"" which glorifies Bradley Manning, the troubled Army private who passed classified military documents to WikiLeaks, is downright nauseating. Crosby definitely got squeezed out of this concert with the lion's share of the songs written by Stills and Nash. He only has one song in the entire second set. The concert's final encore, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, is an absolute joy to watch and listen to even though we all can sing the song backwards in our sleep.

The DVD features a highly edited interview segment in which CSN individually gush over each other. But anyone who has kept pace with CSN knows Crosby and Nash tolerate Stills for business reasons only.

Fans of CSN will appreciate this DVD very much. Let's face it, how much more time is left for these guys to be able to perform together? Too bad Crosby, Roger McGuinn, and Chris Hillman couldn't get together for one last go 'round as the Byrds. We're only three years away from that band's 50th anniversary but McGuinn won't be persuaded even then. And why couldn't someone have put together a DVD of one of the 2011 Buffalo Springfield concerts? Neil Young probably put the kibosh on that.

Postscript - 8/22/13: Nash's hero, traitor Bradley Manning, was convicted of leaking classified documents and sentenced to thirty-five years in military prison. But Manning released a statement today claiming he's actually a woman and is demanding the U.S. Army provide him transgender hormone therapy and surgery. Since the Army refuses to do so maybe multi-millionaire Nash could dip into his hefty bank account and help out his hero.",1343606400,3,4223,4.858333333333333

Yes, we are all getting older, but the music is still great, and that is what we went for and why we buy a set like this. If you like the guys individual stuff, or Crosby/Nash, CSN or CSN&Y, especially their older stuff, just buy it and enjoy!",1343606400,,529,4.145631067961165
5130212,1,B00843TZJ2,This is a complete disappointment.  The singing is terrible. I am a long time fan and I am surprised that they would release such a product.  The harmonies are completely off right from the start with Carry On.  Do not waste your money on this disc.,1343433600,4,249,4.369565217391305
5130213,5,B00843TZJ2,"Another one for us to wallow in.  As I write this,  the Croz' and Stills-ified version of Graham Nash's marvelous though controversial 'Almost Gone'  has yielded to the unofficial ballad of Crosby, Stills and Nash, 'Wasted on the Way'.  All last night I watched the DVD, amazed at the camaraderie of these guys you probably wish you had as your three favorite uncles by now if you are reading this.

'So, Nash maven, why does THIS release go off the radar?'

Graham being as sincere, consistent and likable as ever, it's always good to see and hear him.  David Crosby has come up with a fine song in 'Radio', and is also in good form.  The surprise is how pumped up Stephen Stills is - with a plethora of songs and an overflow of licks, he is allowed to shine, and C/N add just that much more - for example - ""Do you think she loves you?  Do you think at all?"" in 'Bluebird'.  As a result, CSN are at the top of their game, and successfully pull off a few numbers they have not performed in years.  ('Johnny's Garden' turns into a charming duet with the ever-youthful Nash, the trio can still make one shiver singing 'As I Come of Age', 'So Begins the Task' is everything ALL THREE wanted -- admit it, Stephen! - and OH, YES.  They DID IT.  Wait till the grand finale.  You're gonna love it...)

Shayne Fontayne is simply the top of the line as one of a stellar supporting cast;  not forgetting the indispensable James Raymond, who overflows with talent and has learned that less is more on 'Deja Vu'.  Graham looked delighted as always to introduce CSN's backup band....  and there is plenty to look at, you gotta get this if you can't afford front row seats for their tour this year.  Good to have this, as it's been a long time coming INDEED, and ...  oh, yes.  I DID mention the grand finale.  Expect fireworks!  Love you, David, Stephen and Graham.",1343433600,5,1853,4.385294117647059
5130214,5,B00843TZJ2,"I've seen CSN many times over the decades and i feel they are tighter now than ever since maybe the 69-70 era...but back then the Fidelity in the Venue PA was not what is is now and Stage Monitoring [resulting in tuning and vocal issues since they cant hear each other like in the studio...in 2012, this issue is probably due to hearing loss by the guys as well as vocal chord aging-damage] and Audio playback was low quality [YES-Vinyl and Tape rule..BUT..remember the crappy SolidState stereo's of the 1970's at YOUR house, or your 'suitcase' turntable , or eight track ? Or were you one of the few that had Tube and Klipsch Hifi still-lucky you ! ].

First off, re: this DVD , yes Steve is erratic, but he has ALWAYS been that way, and age is hard on the Vox chords.  He is a legend, so he gets a pass in my book.  Plus he nails it on The Suite here !!!

Heck, THESE GUYS ARE (one of) THE ONLY INTACT bands from WOODSTOCK era...The GRATEFUL Dead [not Further] is gone, Hendrix, Joplin, The Band, and many others, and the others still alive are disbanded like Santana [the Original key Members-ie: Greg Rolie and Mike Shrieves], Ten Years After, Mountain, Sly, Grease Band-Joe Cocker, Jeff-Air, etc.  Face it, IF YOU LOVE CSN(Y), you probably love Woodstock-1969 (not to be confused with Pepsi-stock 94/99), so this matters in 'that' light ;)

So when you think of that, its a real treat to see these guys kickin butt in 2012 (sure there's rough edges, but it sounds better than they did at Yasgurs' Farm in 1969 and its in Tune!).

OK so its not CSNY&Taylor-Reeves, but they always have had different backing bands, but the Crux is intact.  For example, you cant (really) have the Grateful Dead without Garcia (or Weir) or Moody Blues without Hayward or Lodge, The Band without Helms or Danko, you get the point.

This DVD is well done and does them justice (esp on a big screen).  Its also nice to have the CD's as i have had a hard time finding HiFi audio of the current line up.  The band also is great (B3, Bass, backing guitars, etc).  Its also great they got this out so fast onto DVD-Audio (usually takes 1-2 years).

Also, the last time i saw them in 2008 and here, i must say, DAVID CROSBY has done a total 180 from his low down days.  He truly is MANIFESTING AS A LEGEND right in front of you, you are looking at the PEAK of his energy in its most distilled and refined form-on par with Hendrix, Joplin, Morrison (it just took him awhile).  You can ""see"" the confidence and carefreeness of a Master emanating from him.  Also, REMEMBER, he very well could have been gone by now (like Garcia, Joplin, Hendrix), so its truly a blessing that he is not and he is shining!

And don't forget WHAT you are seeing, a SUPERGROUP (the best of the Byrds, Hollies and Buffalo Springfield) still on all four wheels, more or less.

Love ya guys !",1343347200,2,2844,4.384761904761905

But I do have to say I was impressed that the concert was recorded 4/22/12 and it just hit the street!  As for Stills, he has lost a ton of weight but I would have liked to have seen him play a lot more of his vast array of Martin's.  I grew up on these guys and they will always be a part of who I am.  At the end of the show it looked like they had fun and somewhat suprised that they pulled it off... just not quite...",1343260800,,599,3.5692307692307694
5130216,2,B00843TZJ2,"If you have to own absolutely everything CS&N puts out, go ahead and buy this. It's relatively harmless. But as we've sorely learned, music should never be harmless. This is music that takes no risks, and shows little inspiration except for Stills' brief exploration into ""Within You, Without You"" on the final cut, ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes."" (Other than that, I believe Judy Collins would like them to stop singing the song.)
There is very little new here. The boys sound like they're just going through the motions as if they have to fulfill a contract. And sometimes, the motions are quite sloppy. It's interesting to hear ""Carry On,"" a song that was a disaster on ""Four-Way Street."" They still can't perform it live 40 years later and come anywhere near the studio version.
I thought the acoustic songs would be the saving grace but that is not to be. Why they decided to slur ""Girl from the North Country"" is beyond comprehension. Musically, they're way past their prime. Their trademark harmonies no longer bring chills, just cringes. The back-up band provides the best moments.
Like everyone else here, I agree that Stills should sing solo. His voice has evolved into a bluesy growl that cannot be sweetened by his partners. In addition, if he is such a guitar legend as many claim, where's the solos? His playing has the same old stiff, fuzzy buzz that it's had for 30 years. Come on Steve, you own 100 guitars. Play a different one for a change.
I saw C&N on the 2011 tour and thought they did it all. If you happened to see this 2012 CS&N tour, I'm sure you have fond memories but on the morning after, this package is more like a hangover than a souvenir.",1343088000,3,1664,4.587248322147651
5130217,5,B00843TZJ2,"I love CSN and I really enjoyed the DVD. There are a few harmony issues, but Crosby is 70, Nash is 70 and Stills is the youngster at 67. They sound good, look great and bring back hundreds of great memories. And let's be honest, I doubt Crosby would have bet he'd still be with us (he sounds terrific!).",1343001600,2,303,4.1525423728813555
5130218,5,B00843TZJ2,"I loved the recent Nash/Crosby concert DVD but honestly knowing
about the erratic Stills outputs in recent times, I was a bit
skeptical about how this new CSN DVD would play out. Having such
a deep love for CSN however there was no way that I wasn't going
to pre-order this one.

After watching the entire concert plus the added interviews feature, I have
to say that it exceeded my expectations by a million miles. The
main reason? ... STILLS! The old cliche ""so and so is back!"" doesn't
even do justice. In my opinion, Stephen has not looked, played or sang this
good in a very long time. His hoarsely mumbled vocal delivery of recent times
is gone ... suddenly his harmony and lead vocals are clear, clean, accurate
and very passionate. His acoustic and electric guitar playing is stellar
and as soulfully seasoned as any recent work of Clapton.

Both Nash's and Crosby's performances here are off the charts and in step with
their recent brilliant DVD release. But again I need to re-emphasize that with this
resurgence of Stills, this is maybe the best ever CSN show I have ever seen on
video.

Without paying much attention to the back of the package before watching,
I didn't even realize there were two sets in this show. I was very satiated
after the first set and happily surprised when realizing there was another set.
Well the second set is even better than the first with its emphasis on classic
acoustic oriented nuggets from each member's catalog and collective catalog.
I was totally not expecting to hear Stills perform ""And So Begins The Task""
or ""As I Come Of Age"". The final encore in the show is the kicker though and
worth the price of admission here. It is an amazing rendition of Suite For Judy
Blue Eyes that is not to be believed.

The supporting band which appears to be most of the group that backed Nash and Crosby
on their recent DVD is as pro as you will ever find anywhere and their ability to
switch between blues, rock, country and jazz treatments is spectacular. The sound
mix on this Blu-Ray is stellar and the camera work is very intimate as well. Even
with highly anticipated releases, I usually watch them and then don't revisit them
for a while. This one I wanted to watch over again immediately. For the deep or novice CSN fan,
this DVD is a treasure and not to be missed.",1343001600,4,2313,4.526315789473684
5130219,5,B00843TZJ2,"CSN has not exactly flooded the market with new releases - the latest release of the 3 together being the CSNY release of ""Deja Vu Live"" which was extremely Neilocentric, to say the least. So for all fans this is a very welcome occasion to hear an official, brilliantly recorded concert.

And thankfuly they deliver a profound evening, mixing the old classics with newer songs, including Graham Nash's controversial and poignant tribute to Bradley Manning ""Almost Gone"". And diving deep into their impressive back catalogue, specially Stephen Stills who come up with the rarely performed ""As I Come Of Age"" and ""So Begins The Task"" (both played at the CSNY 1970 tour). Especially the first is truly magic, providing one of the moments of transcendent (vocal) beauty that is unique for this trio.

As for the backingband it's almost the same as on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crosby-Nash-In-Concert/dp/B005I4HNTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crosby-Nash: In Concert</a>&nbsp;with the addition of Todd Caldwell on the Hammond B-3. a band who knows how to respectfully lay back but also can rock with the best of them all anchored by the drumming of Steve DiStanislao (known for his work on David Gilmour's ""Island""-album and following tour).

Much malign has been said about Stills's vocal, but actually his singing is better here than it has been in many years really enabling him to hit the higher notes. And his legendary guitarplaying as firery and riveting as ever. Graham Nash - probably one of the all time most underrated songwriters - and David Crosby still delivers their trademark harmony vocals.

This band has for whatever reasons always attracted a certain animosity and some decisevely unfair criticism. But they also have a dedicated fan base and this DVD clearly shows the strong bond - and deep rapport - between band and audience.

Sure the day when they were the vanguard is long gone, but what they deliver 2012 is very far from nostalgia and cash-in. So their broad and dedicated fan base should delight in this. And for new fans/listeners this might be the perfect introduction to one of the most adventurous and prolific bands ever.",1343001600,20,2203,5.247159090909091
5130220,5,B00843TZJ2,"The last time I saw CSN live was in St. Louis, June 2009. They didn't get along on stage and the  tension between them was palpable. That being said, I was dubious about what I would find on this DVD/CD combo set. Not only was I pleasantly surprised, I was blown away by the stellar delivery from the infamous trio. Stills in particular is over the top in his performance. He looked like he was having a blast. And those guitar riffs...incredible! Crosby and Nash are equally as talented. All three men really poured their hearts into the concert that night. Yeah, they're older. But if you're a fan of CSN then so are you. I'm sure the Lady Gaga crowd would guess Crosby, Stills, and Nash is the name of some law firm! And on a personal note, I'm glad that they're getting along once again. Whatever hurts have passed between them have seemingly healed over. They compliment each other generously on stage and in the interview portion of the DVD. Nice to see that happen. Anyway, drop the 17 bucks and buy this set. It's incredible. You won't be disappointed.",1342915200,4,1060,4.520833333333333
5130221,5,B00843TZJ2,"I don't agree with the negative reviews here.  Considering that Graham and David are 70 and Stephen is 67,
they sound pretty damn good for their age and can still rock it on stage.  How many bands or musicians can
say they have been playing on stage for 40 or 50 years?  Not many or certainly not many that still can play
well and excite the audience like these guys do with this DVD/Blu-ray.

Going into this I was concerned about Stephen's voice since the last time I saw CSN in concert a few years ago,
he sounded terrible with little voice left.  For this concert, which was filmed this past April, he sounds much
better than I have heard him in years.  He's certainly past his prime and is not what he was as a singer but he
really had some extra juice going for this show especially the last song, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.  His guitar playing,
flawless.

Graham and David's voices were great as usual and they have the usual banter on stage in between songs.  The other
musicians playing with them are all very good and David has his son James Raymond on keyboards.  They play most of
the favorites you would know and the new songs for the most part are pretty good.  The only negative I would bring
up is that for the past 10 years they have brought some politics into their concerts (which I think should be left
out of concerts).  This one is no different but it's not nearly as bad when they were with Neil Young on their last
tour together which so blatant and heavy handed that a number of people walked out of the concert I attended.  This
time their discussion on Bradley Manning (the soldier who leaked miltary documents to wikileaks) was not nearly as
abrasive and Graham actually had a valid point about the issue.

Technically the Blu-ray is fine.  The image is clear and there is plenty of shot changes on stage as well as audience
shots.  No fancy light show or multimedia on stage, just a bunch of guys playing their hearts out for you to enjoy.
The audio is only in DTS-Stereo (on bluray) but I was OK with that and was still able to crank the volume on my receiver
to fully enjoy the show.

(1) David and Graham's lead vocals sound strong and clear.

(3) Kick-butt backing band. Great drumming and a tight ensemble sound
(4) Good value for the dollar. Two CDs and one DVD for less than $20.00.

The not-so good:
(1) Stephen's voice is shot. As a huge Stills fan, this is a painful reality for me to accept. His harmonies waver a lot too.
(2) Because Stills' harmonies aren't spot-on, Crosby and Nash's vocalizing suffers too whenever Stills is part of the mix. Having seen C&N as a duo, they sound much better without Stills.
(3) The new songs, ""Radio"" and ""Almost Gone"" are nothing special and tend to meander. Their cover of ""Girl From The North Country"" is so-so, as well. It helps explain perhaps why the covers album project was shelved.",1342483200,78,889,4.591194968553459

There are interviews with the band and CSN. I bought it today at Best Buy for 16.99. Someone made mention of the audio but believe me the material and performances overcome the means. Stills sounds better than he has in years and also looks like he lost weight as does David Crosby. It appears they may be taking better care of themselves. Hopefully this will help them stay around longer. The two CD's of the material are the big bonus here. A great bargain for one of the best groups to last through so many years.
