8532939,5,B008Z24KS8,"This is The Royal Road to Card Magic by Hugard and Braue in DVD format.  R.Paul Wilson does a terrific job of translating the written word into video format.  There are a few of the effects that are in The Royal Road to Card Magic that are not on the DVDs, but not many.  R.Paul Wilson follows the road, and discusses the Overhand Shuffle, Riffle Shuffle, Hindu Shuffle, Glide, Force, Key Card, Palm and many other techniques that will have you performing great card magic. At times, R.Paul Wilson will deviate from the book and show you more efficient methods than the ones written in The Royal Road to Card Magic.  The only trick in this DVD set which you will not find in the Royal Road to Card Magic is ""Pass At Red"" by Roy Walton.  Other than these few detours , R.Paul Wilson does an excellent job of following The Royal Road to Card Magic. R.Paul Wilson recommends that you get the book and follow along with the 5 DVDs.  I would go further than that, and say read the book many times , gaining an understanding of  what Hugard and Braue was trying to convey with a given sleight, effect etc.... Then watch the DVD and see if your interpretation matches that of R.Paul Wilsons. Some of the effects covered by R.Paul Wilson include: Telepathy Plus, A Pocket Discovery, An Instinct for Cards, Grays Speller, Rapid Transit , Lightning Card, Obliging Aces, and so much more. Whichever way you go Book, DVD, or both, you will be more than a competent performer with a deck of cards if you follow The Royal Road to Card Magic.",1483747200,4,1527,4.451612903225806

8532941,5,B008Z24KS8,"This excellent 5-DVD series supplements the classic book, The Royal Road to Card Magic. That book, by Hugard & Braue, has taught generations of magicians how to do seeming miracles with cards.  Still, the illustrations in the book are limited and no match for a live-action demonstration.  That brings us to Paul Wilson, a superb card magician, and his partnership with L&L Publishing, known in the magic community for creating well-filmed videos.  The result in this DVD set is many hours of outstanding instruction.  As good as The Royal Road book is, it was published decades ago--Wilson in effect updates the book by performing all of the sleights and many of the effects in the book, and by providing helpful commentary along the way.  The clarity of the filming, along with multiple camera angles, makes this a very effective learning tool. By all means get the book and start with it--then supplement what you're learning with the DVDs.

I would not recommend the discount DVD series offered by a different company and featuring a different performer.  I mistakenly got that set first, and was disappointed.  The Wilson/L&L series is in a class by itself.",1407715200,6,1162,4.953608247422681
