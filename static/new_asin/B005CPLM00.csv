8465775,5,B005CPLM00,"This video should be shown in every class middle school on up.  If these people who have been so horribly maligned can forgive those who ordered and performed such unspeakable deeds, then....most of us have something to learn about the depth of love and forgiveness that is possible.",1490313600,,283,4.895833333333333

8465778,5,B005CPLM00,Fambul Tok is a mind-blowing documentation of campfire meetings being held throughout Sierra Leone as a means of community-level reconciliation post-war. It is very moving and a highly worthwhile watch. Would be excellent to view with a group of friends or a discussion group.,1368230400,,276,5.295454545454546
8465779,5,B005CPLM00,"This is an incredibly moving, beautifully produced documentary about a topic that so many are shielded from in our secure, free lives in the United States of America.  We watched this film with our older children (13 and up) and had a deep conversation afterward about our freedom and our responsibility to other human beings. This is worth seeing and recommending to all of your friends!",1327363200,,388,4.878787878787879
8465780,5,B005CPLM00,"I saw this program at a film festival this past fall (2011) and it FLOORED me.

How could victims and violators of the worst sort come to any sort of mutual understanding and progressive future?  How can victims become the empowered in the reconciliation process? And how can violators come to terms with their atrocities and begin to heal themselves?

These are weighty themes, and I hope I'm not making this film sound like a textbook, but you'll find an interesting consideration of these questions played out in reality when you view this remarkable film.

I only hope that Fambul Tok transcends Sierra Leone and makes the mark it should on the rest of the world.",1322352000,2,667,4.724137931034483
