6132484,5,B00H4ZEDL6,I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.  Questions were answered regarding family relations that I had.  I delivered a baby nearly at the moment she beat Bobby Riggs....always wanted to know the exact time she did so I could compare with my son's birth certificate.  !,1426032000,,267,5.0227272727272725

6132492,5,B00H4ZEDL6,"I saw this a few months back and was pleasantly pleased.  I mean, I knew BJK was a big deal, but I was a little kid in the 1970s and didn't know all the details.  As an African-American citizen, I knew that Joe Louis' famous fight was a big deal that meant far more than just a sports activity.  Here, they speak of how BJK's game against an obvious sexist and lazy tennis-playing guy also had much import.  They not only have Steinem interviewed here, but also 1st Lady Clinton.  BJK was one of the 1st women out in sports.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I swear I heard Martina Nat. talking smack about the Williams sisters and I thought it tinged with racial insensitivity.  Thus, I loved seeing BJK supporting women of color in the sport.  In this era of ""post-this"" and ""post-that,"" many forget that decades ago, people would fight --isms head on and not deny their immensity.  This was a great reminder of that.  This doc really put me in a mood to give two loud snaps to this athletic icon.  At the Center on Halsted in Chicago, there is a big painting in honor of her.  I'm glad the Windy City gave her props like that.",1393200000,3,1118,4.29665071770335
8630057,5,B00H4ZEDL6,Great documentary.  I can't believe it has only 19 reviews.  An intriguing historical reference; Billie Jean King and the women who helped pioneer Billie Jean's efforts are a remarkable group of people who made their mark in history.  Engaging for sure.

8630061,5,B00H4ZEDL6,I never knew about American women history.  Glad to learn more about this with closed caption.

8630064,5,B00H4ZEDL6,"Outstanding social history about the turbulent 60s and 70s when social change advancing civil rights and women's rights was happening on a mass scale ... Billie Jean King epitomized the struggle for equal pay for women in pro sports ... and beyond .... she and Riggs put tennis on the map and stimulated Americans to pursue the game .... that match in 1973 probably created more US champions as a result .... aside from the tennis, you learn about the life of a great champion and hero to millions of people the world over ....",1431475200,,527,4.557894736842106
