However, he wasn't one of them. After seeing this instruction techquies via this tape, it is obvious why he was highly regarded by Black Belt Magazine and colleagues.",1377907200,,341,4.796610169491525
7887955,5,6305235546,"Great book! Great pictures so you can learn enough to get yourself in major trouble. Use this book with alot of guidance from your SIFU! Do this on your own and the three section staff will sense your weakness and immediatley try to kill you by attacking your head, and other parts of the body! Start small and build up then maybe you will only be slightly wounded! Maybe get a knights helm and wear it when you practice! That might help! Any way, the book is great! But after trying out this weapon...well its time for my spinning class! Have fun!",1204502400,,548,4.382352941176471
