188106,5,1570764433,"There is no way to communicate successfully with our horses, if we do not first take time to understand their physical capabilities. This DVD helps get all riders back on the right track. It will help them succeed in a fair and knowledgeable way, when asking their horses to answer the aids. The result of the information in this DVD is the difference between fighting with a painful horse or dancing with an athlete. As we all care about our horses, we need to love them enough to learn more of what they can realistically accomplish physically. This DVD is universal in approach, and beyond a gift of kindness to the horses we ride. As riders, we all want to do what is right, however, we need to go back to school, correcting rider expectations of the past.  A better horse is right under the skin. I would recommend this DVD to riders of all disciplines.",1358985600,4,858,4.5
188107,5,1570764433,Ive had the book for years and have used it as my base for everything I know about horses and training. I finally decided to get the DVD because i enjoyed the book so much. It is by far the best investment I have ever made. The dvd and book go great together but if you have to choose one go with the DVD. This is not a training method...this is proven facts based on veterinary science and how horses are designed to be ridden. EVERY RIDER AND HORSEMAN NEEDS THIS BOOK. If you never purchase another horse book/dvd in your life get this. It will change everything you think you know. Amazing and beyond words. It truly is a revolution that the horse world very much needs!,1328918400,5,673,4.265625
188108,3,1570764433,"The program starts out really good. Good subject matter experts, lots of explination of scientific facts of anatomy and motion. But then it gets a little to dramatic/preachy toward the end. About 70% really good material. I think if you want to get the message out to the modern competitors, you need to use more facts and less emotion. It is a little expensive, but you will learn something from it. I don't regret purchasing it.",1313107200,5,430,4.671052631578948
188109,5,1570764433,"I had viewed this particular DVD previously and own the book.
This DVD is excellent and very educational.
It is something that every horse owner, trainer, FEI Judge, etc should view to understand the bio mechanics of the horse and how modern riding can damage the horse and shorten not only its show-career but its life!
Thank you",1275264000,3,330,4.706896551724138
188110,5,1570764433,"This video gives an amazing look inside how a horse is put together and how it moves.  Only by understanding the musculoskeletal system and how it functions, as well as how our aids and training methods work to affect this movement, can we learn to train with 'helping the horse do its job' in mind.

Dr. H has put together a phenomenal video that gives information in great depth, but also makes the knowledge accessible to all and easy to understand, even for someone not well-versed in dressage terminology of the specialized language of equine anatomy.

Regardless of your own niche in the wide realm of horsemanship, this DVD can help you understand movement and the effects of our interventions on the horse's movement.

In addition to all that, the graphics and digital video of 'real' horses give a clear picture of what is 'correct' and helpful to the horse, as well as what may give the appearance of 'correct' but is detrimental in the long run.",1268265600,11,956,4.706586826347305
188111,5,1570764433,"A very good image of modern riding,a riding only for a succes without regarding the physiological and psychological needs of the horse. Very good 3 dimensional pictures of the moving horse in a wrong and correct riding.
DVD that should be seen by every coach and rider trying to get succes in riding in a more natural way,without torturing the horse. A way that don't make horse invalids.",1260835200,5,388,4.720588235294118
188112,5,1570764433,Everyone who aspires to be a trainer or judge should study this DVD carefully because it is a wonderful teaching tool.,1260748800,2,118,4.666666666666667
188113,5,1570764433,"Hopefully this DVD and the accompanying book, will revert riders and trainers of horses to friendlier and more durable methods of training horses. For a good few years a slow but noticeable aversion has spread over certain ""modern"" training methods. What is this about? Why? Indeed we have swerved a long way from patient, animal friendly expectations of these animals on whom we should feel priveleged of mounting and enjoying every step of a well planned and executed training programme. I first came into contact with the makers of the DVD at a convention in Ireland, where I saw first hand how the amazing 3D animations of the horse's muscoskeletal system would illustrate it's natural and man-induced unnatural movement as discussed on this DVD. The result is amazing and should ideally be seen in conjunction with the book.

Mind you all: the DVD is not amusing at all. Instead, it clearly and clinically illustrates todays alarming techniques that have found their way into equestrianism and are supposed to train horses from an outline that dressage judges seem to prefer and admire, having little eye for clear irregularities in the horse's gaits, caused by incorrect riding and training.

Perhaps, just maybe, the world's best can practice these training methods safely. But the vast majority of riders and trainers copies them, unwillingly without empathy, without patience and with little or no understanding, repeatedly damaging horses limbs and spine, expecting them to reach a very high level of competence in dressage at an age of only five or just over. Today it is about the quick resale value of the horse, about the glory of the rider, quick fixes seemingly supported by ""modern"" training techniques. Low and round carriage of the horse's neck and head during training are seen as proof of submission and an advanced level of competence. Wide spread stupidity and ignorance of riders and trainers and on many occasions a staggering incompetence of dressage judges around the globe is causing massive and wide spread harm to horses' physique. I see it live, every day, with my own eyes. It is heart wrenching. If horses could speak, there wouldn't be so many ""mysterious"" lamenesses. If horses could speak they would tell us it's their back that makes their walk choppy, not an ailment located in the lower leg. Or indeed pain in a limb caused by a forced way of going. Never mind expensive scientifically proven joint supplements, state-of-the art stable and field blankets, flashy bridleware, designer clothes and impeccably white training wraps. Start thinking all over again: If horses could speak, they would shout at us as by now we are wearing them out prematurely. But they don't. Nobody does.

A radical change in expectations versus time has to be readopted, as used to generally be the case only half a century ago and as it still is commonsense among a few trainers and renowned equestrian centres. A durable result and continuous health, performance and happiness of a horse can only be realised by reevaluating our training, judging methods and understanding of quality of the horses' gaits. All persons involved in dressage and basic flatwork training, riding and judging should be aware of the thorough scientific evidence that is so clearly shown on this DVD. The equestrian world is very much on the wrong track not having signalled and halted these wide spread practices, bar some individuals and organisations. Horses would have told us that a long time ago. If they could speak.

Instead they seem to be doomed to let us carry on without us understanding basic biomechanical principles that are so graphically illustrated in this valuable pair of a book and a DVD. Watch, read, act and spread the word and we will be worth the glory we work towards. The glory of the combined performance of truly good training and the amazing willingness and ability of our horses.

Worth five stars as six are not an option.

188114,5,1570764433,"This is an excellent follow up to the book: Tug A War.  The video gives examples of diagrammatic visuals for how muscles work in coordination with specific movements within the horses skeletal frame.  I am a visual learner.  Therefore, the video has fine-tuned my ability to discern good from bad riding.  I am amazed at how many famous, world class competitive riders, are doing it all wrong for crowd pleasing purposes at the expense of the well being of their horses. I cannot believe how the current international judges are rewarding these riders for the leg moving health compromised performance horses.
Thank you to the author for being brave enough to take the stance of telling us the truth in spite of going against all  of the competitive riders who use horses as a means to an end.  These beautiful animals give us so much and they do not deserve to be exploited and broken for the sake of our arrogance and greed.

Bravo again to this author!",1257033600,19,955,4.648809523809524

188119,3,1570764433,"The gentlemen interviewed throughout the film show extensive knowledge.  The film shows how the horse should and should not move and human error in using too much hand.
I would have liked to see more of what the rider should do.  How the rider should act and ride to motivate the horse to move efficiently and comfortably.  There was a lot of veterinary, historian and professional theoretical points of view.  It would have been nice to see more practical examples (there was only one example of a young chestnut being ridden) of how a horse should be ridden, taught, dealt with, etc.
Overall, I learned from it but would have liked to learn more.",1396915200,8,648,4.657894736842105

I hope every person who enjoys horses....watching them, living with them, having them as companions, teaching them, keeping them, riding them....gets to watch this DVD...better, owns this DVD.  I don't have my own horse and I've been privileged to have sponsored several.  I wish I'd seen this DVD when I was a child...many decades ago.  I am sure I did many things wrong that resulted in pain and discomfort to the horse who was carrying me.  The one lesson that I learned from this video is that horses did not evolve to carry things and other animals on their backs....and that thousands of years of domestication of the horse has resulted in training them to become beasts of burden.  Humans should know this deep in their hearts and always be thankful that this glorious creature has the generousness of character and gentleness to permit a human to get on its back.",1391212800,3,931,4.860759493670886

188122,3,1570764433,"Beautifully illustrated and narrated explanation of horses' kinesiology by a German vet and rider/trainer who has deeply studied how their muscles, skeleton, and movement are integrated -- and what this means for riders of all types. He's rightfully appalled by the training and gaits encouraged by current dressage competitions, which restrict natural neck and back movement, and probably do cause many animals to suffer. He briefly mentions the damage resulting from modern practices which stress young horses excessively.

There is also an unspoken 'subtext' here -- that it's just aesthetically offensive for competitive expectations to reward styles that depend on such unnatural, unphysiologic configurations. It's as if gymnastics' standards rewarded our 10 year old girls for turning themselves into deformed circus contortionists.

Dr. Heuschmann is understandably polemical, given his minority, anti-establishment perspective. But the bulk of the film is soberly presented, academically sound. Unfortunately, the filmmakers open the film with inappropriate, ridiculously lurid images of horses undergoing surgical procedures and anesthesia -- as if it were an anti-vivisectionist propaganda screed. While these images may serve to shock the (ignorant) viewer, they are entirely normal practices of the profession. This distasteful content only distracts from the core message of the author, that the current international dressage business promotes an unnatural, cramped, contortionist style of riding.",1371340800,2,1512,6.0607476635514015
