5726255,5,B00CLJ3A1Y,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is different compared to what we were used to expect from a Central American film. The story is fantastic, and the actors'performance is excellent. The only thing I can make a remark about is on one of the last scenes where Diego appeared dressed in silver clothes... Personally I think that this part broke the ambiance built during the whole film. Nevertheless I encourage the film director to continue his brilliant work on the eagerly awaited continuation of the saga!

Regarding the quality of the DVD... It is well made, except for the subtitles... It is well translated but the quality of the subtitles' image is very poor. I could find at least a couple of misspellings also.",1371600000,,715,4.766129032258065

5726260,5,B00CLJ3A1Y,"As a Sci-Fi fanatic, I am often searching for the best and greatest original films; which is how I arrived to ""El Xendra."" Undoubtedly, one of the most ambitious, well-produced and captivating productions that I have recently watched. I am extremely satisfied with the movie and its story; which takes places in La Moskitia, Honduras. The story involves four Central American scientists who make a deal with the Honduran government to become part of an experiment--or so they think. In reality, they have been chosen to be part of something greater...something that will help them conclude their own scientific project.

If you are a UFO, ET, experiences-of-the-third-kind type of person, you will certainly enjoy this movie. And don't worry, it comes with English subtitles.",1375056000,,775,5.25
5726261,5,B00CLJ3A1Y,"First thing you need to do: forget about Hollywood movies. This is something else; refreshing. This is Art, and filled with Soul.

I've been part of Rahma for more than 15 years, so I must say it was really something awesome to have Oxalc as one of the stars here, though we don't get to see him.
The plot is extremely interesting and shows what is happening nowadays with such thing we call 'time'.
Absolutely beautiful photography, and as times goes by, this movie gets you more and more involved.
I must admit. Had to watch it twice to fully understand the final events on the movie. Far from being something annoying, it really gets you to see more in the depths many things that you missed at first glance.
Congratulations to the producer, and everybody involved, including Sixto Paz and Richard Gonz&aacute;lez!
Buy it. It's a gem. Enjoy it! And wait for the sequel. You'll really wanna see it!",1373846400,4,900,4.625
5726262,5,B00CLJ3A1Y,"Fun, interesting, intriguing, captivating, are just some of the words I can use for this movie. The refreshing look and style of cinematography makes it stand on its own, putting it in a whole different pedestal. The story is certainly something to make you want to go yourself to the sites where it took place. To summarize, I just can't wait for the sequel, I hope they don't take too long.",1373155200,,392,4.535211267605634

5726264,5,B00CLJ3A1Y,"This is a must see for anyone seeking to understand the possibility of close encounters with extraterrestrial (and intraterrestrial) beings. It also opens a window for wondering what their intentions might be; which is supposed to be revealed in upcoming sequels
Great work!",1372550400,,274,5.395348837209302
5726265,5,B00CLJ3A1Y,"The movie was based on true facts, given by extraterrestrial contacts. It was well written and acted, all the elements in the movie were brought in an interesting manner. Explaining what's the meaning of a xendra and its use in the experience with aliens. Treating the experience of contact with aliens with the respect and seriousness it deserves in a suspense and thrilling manner. Love it. Looking forward for the next chapter.",1372118400,,430,4.986111111111111

8583127,5,B00CLJ3A1Y,"El Xendra is a science fiction movie where four scientists set off on a mysterious adventure through the untamed jungles of Central America, following messages sent to them by extraterrestrial beings. The movie is filled with suspense as the mystery begins to unravel, and theres heart-pounding action thrown into the mix. There are some really spooky scenes that will give you goosebumps, and a touching, spiritual reunion for one of the scientists in a place that could be considered a limbo between life and death that will bring tears to your eyes. Its definitely a movie that makes you think and makes you question the state of humanitys universal consciousness.

El Xendra es una pelicula de ciencia ficcion en la que cuatro cientificos se fueron a una mysteriosa expedicion atravez de la jungla de Centro America, siguiendo los mensajes enviados por extraterrestres. La pelicula esta llena de misterio, accion, y suspenso a medida que progresa la historia. Hay escenas de miedo que mantienen a uno sorprendido. Hay una escena espiritual que uno de los cientificos tiene entre la vida y la muerte, muy emotiva y sentimental. Definitivamente es una pelicula que te hace pensar y nos hace preguntar el estado de conciencia universal de la humanidad.

8583128,1,B00CLJ3A1Y,"I always hated it when the late Roger Ebert trashed a movie just because he was having his man-period and kept falling asleep and thus did not understand the plot, like with THE VILLAGE.  But this mind-numbing amateurish local-green-jungle UFO religious flick -- inspired by real extraterrestrial contacts, it claims -- with a hero or two and one woman being lead to Heaven by a bald silver-lame-wearing human-turned-alien, is so Bad I might beg to be injected with that new chemical designed to erase the horrible memories of soldiers with PTSD.  Worry about Spoilers, do you?  If you stepped in this on a lawn, you would be less spoiled by what the dog left than by watching this movie.  What is THE BOSTON SCIENCE FICTION FILM FESTIVAL and who the h*ll is Jay Seaver, EfilmCritic USA?  Does anyone know?  Maybe it's a terrorist pod of Costa-Ricans-led by an alien named Jay?  The only people who love this movie must be from either Costa Rica or Honduras and admire the movie's handsome protagonist actor.  Read these 5-star reviews and wonder if they all came from The Church of Scientology.  This is a real Hoax.  The Mayans' prediction for 2012 was wrong, and they missed understanding Spanish Conquistadors were murderers, so someone still believes them?  OMG.  I have seen student films using 8 mm that are infinitely better, and not just one done by George Lucas.  No amount of stomach tablets can quench the acid caused by this total disaster.  Maybe just one star for the shots of the girl's fine behind from behind?  The cameraman knew at least one angle that would please the guys in raincoats.  Ed Wood movies are never this boring, never.",1457308800,,1653,4.767605633802817
