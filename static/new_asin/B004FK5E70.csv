8427856,5,B004FK5E70,"This is one of the better ambient DVDs I've seen. The music and scenery are quite relaxing and beautiful. It automatically replays too, which is a wonderful thing, especially for sleeping. I've seen plenty of ambient DVDs that I wish I hadn't bought, but I'm very happy with this one. It's lovely looking at pretty gardens and brightly colored flowers.",1393977600,3,352,4.883333333333334
8427857,3,B004FK5E70,"It was pretty flowers, but left us bored; we cut it off after about 10 minutes..
We watch a lot of garden dvds, and Audrey Hepburn's is still our favorite.
Some of the English garden dvds are very good also.
(Make sure any dvd you are considering from other countries will work on
American dvd players).  This dvd was just OK.",1366156800,3,326,4.344262295081967
