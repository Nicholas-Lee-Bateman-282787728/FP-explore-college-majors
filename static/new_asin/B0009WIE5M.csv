8068243,1,B0009WIE5M,Stopped watching the movie after about 15 minutes. The store line just dragged on and on - didn't look like there would be an improvement. Too bad La Ultima Noche was quite good.,1454371200,,178,4.424242424242424
8068244,4,B0009WIE5M,"This movie was apparently very popular in Mexico and was part of a trilogy. The other two films are predictably named La Primera Noche and La Ultima Noche. It was a fun coming of age movie about 4 teen girls, each of whom has her own issues with family and sexuality. The actresses were good. One has gone on to add a pop music career to her telenovela acting.

Also, I am trying to learn Spanish and loved the fact that this DVD offered both English and Spanish subtitles, which is not a given with Mexican releases.",1172275200,7,517,4.329896907216495
