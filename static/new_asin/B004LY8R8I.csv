8496128,5,B004LY8R8I,I have played electric bass for years and picked up a Stagg EUB for a reasonable price. Based on amazon recommendations reviews I bought two other DVDs and just run into this one and chucked it in given the price. This was definitively the most comprehensive one for beginning. It teaches all the stuff about positioning and the basics and then gets you playing simple examples. So... will you play like Rufus Reid after this DVD... clearly not. But it gives you all the information you need to tackle instructional books. Its just that.... a good introduction to upright bass.,1381017600,,577,4.78
