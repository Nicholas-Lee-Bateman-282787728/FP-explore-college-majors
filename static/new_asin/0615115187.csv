With it's references to all 3 of the star wars movies and the great acting, George Lucas in love is possibly one of  the greatest short films ever made. I'm not the only one who thinks so.

2679,3,0615115187,"This DVD is fun. Not the best of all the Star Wars Satires I have seen, but certainly on of the few that focuses on George Lucas and his universe.
Done to the tone of ""Shakespeare In Love"", this movie has cute moments, Star Wars inuendos and some clever diaglogue. The performances are very good too.
It's cute. For the Die Hard - Star Wars fan this is a must. Be warned, its very short!",1023235200,,387,4.173333333333333
2680,4,0615115187,"Ok, so I never saw ""Shakespeare in Love"".  After watching this 10 minute Star Wars/Shakespeare spoof, I'm not sure I want to.  I'm sure it's a fine movie, but what ""George Lucas in Love"" accomplished in only 10 minutes surely can't be improved over the course of a 2-hour movie (perhaps I'm also still bitter that it beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" for best picture of 1998.. grrrrr).  That little rant aside, Star Wars is probably the most frequently spoofed movie or cultural phenomenon of all time (with Star Trek running a close second).  This current incarnation takes its inspiration from ""Shakespeare in Love"" and finds a college-age George Lucas struggling to find his inspiration to write an 'agricultural space opera' for his final project.  As he walks across campus to meet with his advisor, you see many quirky schoolmates who seem to have inspired different characters and plots in Star Wars, from Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt.  Even his advisor engages in the backward speak that defines Yoda.  George finds his inspiration in the form of an attractive co-ed who's hairstyle seems vaguely familiar.  There is even a little twist that romance that I dare not mention.  This is a hilarious send up of two very successful movies and definitely worth the 9 minutes you will spend watching it.",1023148800,4,1296,4.8545454545454545
2681,5,0615115187,"In ten minutes, how many allusions to Star Wars and George Lucas lore can you make?  Well, if you're the director of ""George Lucas In Love,"" (aka GLIL) dozens.  With a wonderful sense of comedic timing and a finely honed script, GLIL manages to keep its viewers engaged... and looking forward to seeing the next reference to Star Wars.  And for non-Star Wars fans, there's even a version of the film on the DVD explaining the jokes and references, a la ""Pop Up Video.""
There are some other short films on the DVD too, but they're not as good as GLIL.",1019865600,,550,4.425742574257426
2682,5,0615115187,"The plot of this short film revolves around the young George Lucas in his senior year of film school. He's trying to write a great agricultural space epic, but can't seem to put anything together until he meets a beautiful girl with big hair in the student theatre. She encourages him to write what he knows and from there it's movie history.
The DVD version of this short film includes a short commentary by the film's creators, an enhanced version of the film (basically a pop-up video trivia veiwing), a short ""making of"" documentary, chapter search, and a ""special"" secret feature (the code number is 1138). For being a short film, a lot of these features seem redundant. However, they fit in with the spirit of the film and make the DVD that much more entertaining.
Also included on the DVD are three other shorts. EVIL HILL is a parody of the Austin Powers films and the movie NOTTING HILL. A young Mr. Evil (he's not a doctor yet) is treated like a monster by the people in his small town in Bavaria. However, one day Marilyn Monroe wanders into his children's book store and his life is changed forever.
FILM CLUB is a parody of the movie FIGHT CLUB. If you haven't seen the movie, this short parody will make no sense whatsoever. The final short is SWING BLADE, a parody of SLING BLADE and SWINGERS. That short is filmed as a coming attraction and shows what would happen if Karl from SLING BLADE moves to L.A. and hooks up with the gang from SWINGERS.
Overall, a highly entertaining DVD that fans of STAR WARS and/or film buffs will enjoy.",1016150400,2,1549,4.516014234875445
2683,4,0615115187,"This was extremely entertaining for me as I am a huge Star Wars fan, but beware it is only 9 minutes in length.  As long as you go in with that expectation, I'm sure you will find this to be an enjoyable short film.  You also get 3 other shorts on the disc, but they are all less than 10 minutes in length.  Evil Hill was far less entertaining than I had hoped.",1010188800,2,361,3.9178082191780823
2684,5,0615115187,"I've been a Star Wars fan for all of my 20 years and was very impressed by this short film.  I had heard of this fan-fiction short film on the internet but never bothered to download it.  Recently I saw it at a local media store for (a low price) previously viewed on DVD and promplty grabbed it (just got a DVD player and the only other movie I had was Spaceballs).  This short movie was absolutely amazing.  I assure you the only way it could be any better - a full length movie instead of a short film.  My DVD wasn't macrovision encoded so you get awesome video quality - much better than you'd get downloading the film from the web.  Plus a great musical score, scene selection (really necessary on a short film?) and 3 other short films that are also worth watching, especially Evil Hill...

2685,5,0615115187,"I haven't seen either ""Swing Blade"" (although I love the concept) or ""Evil Hill"", but I've seen (and laughed myself almost into a hernia) both ""Lucas in Love"" and ""Film Club.""
One reviewer complained about how ""Film Club"" is only funny to people with noses in the air.  Quite the opposite, although only film geeks will get it.  A deserving mocking of both David Fincher's pretentious feature and the rules of Dogme 95 (which has produced some breathtakingly stupid, boring, and cliched movies), this is a stone riot.
""Lucas In Love"" anyone will get, probably as much a tribute to Star Wars' pop cultural presence as anything.  It's not mean-spirited or ironic in any way (well, okay, maybe Lucas' ""source"" for the Force cuts a little closer to the bone than the rest of the gags if you know some Warsies), it's light, simple fun.
Definitely this is worth fifteen bucks.  If nothing else, it's a great party disc!",1003276800,2,913,4.723270440251572
2686,5,0615115187,"This was a very good short.  I love the way it shows how George Lucas got all of his ideas about how he wrote starwars.  The cast was very good also, who ever played Yoda I think did a fantastic job, I thought that was the best part of the movie.
  Oh and no, I am not a Starwars fan at all, even if you've only seen bits and pieces of starwars this movie is hilairious.  I don't think I ever sat through the whole starwars movie before and I thought this was great.
  If you are a big fan of Austin Powers you should get this one too.  Evil Hill was a good one too.  Swing Blade was even better.  But I did not like Film Club, I thought it was kind of stupid but there was some funny stuff in there.",1000512000,,700,3.832167832167832
2687,5,0615115187,"George Lucas in Love may very well be the ""Form"" of a short film - what the perfect short film should be, in a higher realm of understanding.  A low-budget, well-shot, beautifully scored, and endlessly engaging piece of work, Joe Nussbaum's clever little feature never falls into film-school pretentiousness or short-film stupidity.  Although it is a one-joke premise, the directing and editing manage to keep things moving fast enough that it doesn't get old.
The 8-minute short opens with George Lucas, in his last semester at film school, unable to finish his final project, Space Wheat, which begins ""Not Long Ago in a Nearby Galaxy.""  His teacher (a stubby guy who talks like a certain Jedi Master) is no real help, and it isn't until he meets a girl with hair wrapped tightly in donut-buns (a stunning Lisa Jakob, of Independence Day fame) that he finds a muse who encourages the young Lucas to ""write what he knows.""  What he knows is the dozens of Star Wars references surrounding him, and the rest, as they say, is history.
As much an homage as it is a parody, Lucas in Love succeeds where so many others fail.  A review of the three other shorts on the DVD - ""Evil Hill"" (Dr. Evil meets Notting Hill), Film Club (Fight Club in a film school), and Swing Blade (Sling Blade mixed with Swingers) easily demonstrates how this type of experiment can fall flat on its face, turning into a gigglefest by filmmakers and audiences with the kinds of noses that stick up in the air.  Thankfully, Lucas in Love is never reduced to this insipid level of ""didja get it?  didja?  aren't we CLEVER!!!) that the other films on the DVD do (and, unfortunately, so many other short films available on the Internet).
The DVD features a commentary track by the director and producer, which reveals little about the film (there isn't much time in an 8 minute session), but there is a ""making of"" that actually lasts longer than the film itself - perhaps a first in DVD history - that has all the major players and some great behind-the-scenes stuff.  The real gem is a pop-up video version of the film that shows you all the Star Wars references - chances are, unless you are the most obsessed fan out there, you missed at least one.  There is also a secret code area where you can enter a numeric code you get from mediatrip.com, makers of this DVD.  Considering mediatrip.com is now defunct, I don't feel bad saying that the code is 1138 (as in THX-1138, one of Lucas' early films) and that the secret is a short clip of the director showing off his letter from George Lucas congratulating him on the film.
Is it worth the money for this DVD?  Up to you.  Basically, it's a question of how big of a Star Wars fan you are.  You can download the film from several places on the net, and the SciFi channel runs it every now and then, but if you want the interviews and a crystal-clear transfer, then it's probably worth it.  Besides, it's great to roll out for your friends and show them without boring them.",999388800,6,2994,4.528756957328386
2688,5,0615115187,"This is one of the best parodies I have ever seen. The premise is a young George Lucas, having writer's block, trying to come up with a story that would be timeless. His experiences and encounters with the people in this short movie help build up the myth that is Star Wars.
Now with that introduction over with, let's get into the specifics of how good/bad this DVD actually is. Like I said above, this is an awesome pardoy, spoofing both Star Wars and Shakespeare in Love at the same time. The cast is very well selected and when they show up on screen you can immediately tell which Star Wars character they're supposed to be. The jokes are never forced and are honestly funny, the false ending is absolutely hilarious, as is the actual ending itself. All in all, look forward to having loads of laughs at the story.
However, and I think a lot of critics will agree with me, George Lucas in Love is really too short. I know, I know, it's supposed to be a short movie, but the creators have really whetted my appetite for more. 10 minutes is way too short for a DVD of this caliber. Sequel please ???
There are a few other short clips included in the DVD, including Swing Blade (a parody of both Sling Blade and Swingers), Film Club (a parody of Fight Club) and Evil Hill, which is, like the George Lucas in Love short, essentially an Austin Powers prequel. It depicts the youth of Doctor Evil set in Bavaria a la Notting Hill and it shows how his origin started.
This DVD is fantastic in the comedic sense, hence my 5 star rating above, but don't buy it unless you're a real hardcore Star Wars fan, it's not worth the money.",996883200,3,1627,4.355263157894737

2692,2,0615115187,"I'm sorry,  I just felt like this flick was one joke told again and again for about twenty minutes.

2693,5,0615115187,"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities, we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love, I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan, you might also want to try Hardware Wars.",986342400,2,473,4.266666666666667
2694,5,0615115187,"As a Star Wars fan, I wasn't sure what to expect from this short film. Buying it more on a whim than for any other reason, I popped it in the VCR and promptly laughed so hard that I nearly fell out of my chair! The worst thing about the film is that it is so short, the best thing is that it is short enough that you can go back and watch it over and over in order to catch the lines and nuances you'll miss while laughing so hard. This film imaginatively captures the genesis of every Star Wars character and does a wonderful job of showing a ""plausible"" reason for George Lucas to have created his masterpiece. Star Wars fanatics and casual fans alike will enjoy this extremely well done short film. In my opinion, it would make a great addition to any video collection.",985132800,2,772,4.222972972972973
2695,5,0615115187,"Wow! During the 9 minute span of this short film, these folks were able to throw in every Star Wars/Lucas joke possible (even the low-blow ""Howard the Duck"" joke before the credits). ""George Lucas In Love"" is some wildly funny and entertaining stuff! The character swaps keep the humor moving, yet the nice production gives the film a professional gloss.
For people who are still uncertain about plucking down some cash for a 9 minute DVD, the extra shorts appearing on the film are fairly entertaining as well! ""Evil Hill"" and ""Swingers"" are slightly less affective than the feature, but very funny nonetheless. ""Film Club"" was just. . . silly! The tons of extras included also add to the viewer's entertainment factor.",980553600,3,720,4.909836065573771
2696,5,0615115187,"The sentiment of ""why buy it when you can download it for free?"" isn't even close to being valid here. It's just not possible to appreciate the excellent production and effort that went into this short on a jumpy computer screeen.  This is a real film, worthy of a full-size theater. Lacking that, your TV is the next best thing. Even if you already have the VHS, you won't regret buying the DVD. It's not just the lovely print and sound of the title short, but the copious extras which make this DVD a real bargain. The background and commentary on George Lucas in Love is great, though much of the information is repeated in various forms. Still, it's fun to know how this short came about, and to realize it was truly a professional production all the way around. The additional short films are great to have as well, though you can tell their budgets are far smaller than that of GLIL! Swing Blade is laugh-out-loud funny, but the Film Club short is not to be overlooked. It's a spot-on parody of the Fight Club trailer--the detail is perfect, right down to Brad Pitt's gestures and Edward Norton's expressions. Any fan of Fight Club (and if you have a DVD player you MUST have a copy of Fight Club, right?) will get a big kick out of it. The Evil Hill parody--despite a terrific Dr. Evil impression by Timothy Dowling--is slow and uninspired. This is the guy who thought a live-action Rugrats movie would be a good idea. Mr. Dowling is clearly talented, but judging from this work he needs to stay friends with people who can tell him when his ideas stink. Come to think of it, George Lucas could use a bit of that kind of help as well.",980121600,7,1641,4.433774834437086
2697,5,0615115187,"This parody on ""Shakespeare in Love"" mixed with ""Star Wars"" is an excellent job of filmwork at its best.  George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time, he needs a script to pass film school!  Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again.  Fortunately, the script for ""Star Wars"" is all about him, he only needs to open his eyes and see it.
The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.  You will have to watch this about 10 times in a row just to fill your thirst for it.  This will leave you laughing every time.
The DVD is well done, but the rest of the shorts on the DVD are merely OK.  The extras are nice and really worth watching.",979257600,3,706,4.116788321167883

This is NOT A STAR WARS PARODY!  It is a SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE parody!  Okay?!?!  All the Star Wars fans who dissed this film for making ""hackneyed Star Wars references"" for no reason at all do not realize that the references are not STAR WARS references, they are references to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  It doesn't surprise me at all that a healthy chunk of Star Wars fans haven't seen or even know what SHAKESPEARE is about.  I guess if a movie doesn't have action figures made from it or can't be found at one of those insipid sci-fi conventions, then it must not be worth watching, huh?

'George Lucas In Love' was a very fun short.

If anything, the filmmakers should have done  a 15-20 minute film! The film was very clever and enjoyable. Maybe just a  tad bit funnier than 'Hardware Wars'.
The music, cinematography, and  acting are all very good, indeed.  Anyone who didn't enjoy this at least a  little really needs to get a sense of humor.  Of course, it's a bit cheesy,  but it's meant to be that way.  It's presented in the slightly corny,  overblown way that 'Hardware Wars' or the 'Naked Gun' films were. The same  people who didn't understand those films probably won't understand 'George  Lucas In Love'.  It's not a 'great' film, but who cares?  It's a fun little  short by a guy who really loves 'Star Wars'.  Some have condemned the  filmmakers doing this just for the money. I seriously doubt that Mr.  Nussbaum will make a huge fortune from this film and if he does, big deal.  Nothing wrong with making money from doing what you love or making money at  all.

I've watched it over a dozen times, and each time I see another joke that I missed before.",1073347200,5,485,4.404494382022472
7788141,5,0615115187,"Any fan of George Lucas and of Star Wars -- I'm a hardcore fan of both -- will love this movie. It is clever, witty, and well-crafted, perfectly balancing the directorial styles of Shakespeare in Love (Steadicam shots, lighting) with Star Wars (Lucasian wipes, close-up shots, pans). Some of the most subtle jokes were my favorite, such as the ""womp rats"" line, the Howard the Duck reference, and the THX 1138 door sign.
Enjoy!",1058572800,6,427,4.783783783783784
