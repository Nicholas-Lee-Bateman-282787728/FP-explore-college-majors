8634010,1,B00HO74GNE,"The Iron Lady, 2011 film

A woman buys a pint of milk at a grocery. [The story proceeds slowly. What was its purpose?] There is a flashback to the bombing of WW II. Margaret helps her father at his store (like a good daughter should). The TV tells about an explosion at a Brighton hotel. Next Miss Roberts is chosen as a Conservative candidate for Parliament. She explains her viewpoints. [The film keeps skipping from the present to the past. This is confusing to anyone who knows little of her history.] Margaret will marry Dennis but wants to be more than a housewife. In retirement she watches old home movies of her children. They grow up so fast. She wins a seat in Parliament in 1959 (because of a divided opposition). Welcome to the madhouse. She makes a speech. A strike stops garbage collection and other services. There was a coal miners strike over lowered wages circa 1972.

Margaret decides to run for leader of the party on principle. A man advises her on her appearance to attract voters. She takes voice lessons to project her image. A friend is killed by a bomb! In 1979 she became the first woman Prime Minister in the Western World. [The film jumps ahead again.] Baroness Thatcher was called The Iron Lady. She cut the budget and privatized services. [So how did that work out for the British?] Did she change the face of history? Did her policies cause a drop in industrial production? Were people becoming impoverished? There was growing unemployment. Bombs are set off! The Argentinians invaded the Falkland Islands. Maggie said sink the Belgrano (as it was returning home). An Exocet missile hits British frigate. The British retake the Falkland Islands. This victory proves popular and boosts her standing. She asks for new taxes on everyone and accuses those who disagree with her of cowardice. [Has she grown proud and arrogant?] There are disturbances in the streets.

The jumping back and forth in the first half of this movie makes it difficult to follow if you know little of the details of her life. It should have followed the historical sequence. You see actors who represent actual politicians; they are unknown to those who know the details of British politics. Thatcher destroyed the national coal industry to make the country dependent on imported oil and gas [as far as I know]. This benefitted these special interests. The future will decide if this was a correct decision.

There was a military coup in Argentina in the mid-1960s (part of the Alliance for Progress). It led to the oppression of the people. They attempt to reclaim the Falkland Islands with an invasion. This failure led to their overthrow and a more democratic government. The same thing happened in Greece a decade earlier. Is there a lesson here?

I wonder about the powers that first backed Maggie Thatcher then switched to a new leader (she was rejected by her own party). There was no mention of this in the movie. Was Great Britain in better shape after her reign as Prime Minister? What corporations promoted her?",1518825600,,3028,4.782026768642448

Needless to say I have yet to complete the movie.
