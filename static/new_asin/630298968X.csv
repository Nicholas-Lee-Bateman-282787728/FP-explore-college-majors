528573,3,630298968X,"This is Sonja Henie`s most extravagant musical; she`s backed by Ethel Merman, Don Ameche and Cesar Romero. Merman steals the scenes she`s in as does ""The Wooden Indians!""... The film is nothing more than a series of musical numbers and little mix-ups between the protagonists....  But IT IS done in great style and if u wanna have a musical from the 30s - do SETTLE for this...  However... if u want a story in addition to musical numbers - skip it - and settle for Sonja`s other films:-)",1103500800,,488,4.534090909090909
7833119,5,630298968X,"The price of this movie is worth seeing and hearing 'The War Dance of The Wooden Indians' alone, but Ethel Merman knocking out Cesar Romero with lamp and vase TWICE  is priceless.  Some shenanigans and lots of ice skating and music!  Who could ask for more?!",1507766400,,258,4.565217391304348

7833122,5,630298968X,"I am trying to collect all of Sonja Henie movies.  I grew up watching her films on television.  What is really rewarding, is they still hold up.
Extremely entertaining musicals. I will continue purchasing her movies at your web site.",1426032000,,233,4.8

7833124,3,630298968X,"The DVD is worth watching for the terrific musical number (instrumental followed by a tap routine) by Raymond Scott and his Quintet.  Scott wrote the wacky tunes used, among other things, as soundtrack for Warner Bros cartoons.  Scott also created the first synthesizer.",1401580800,,270,5.255813953488372
7833125,4,630298968X,"If you enjoy musicals of the golden age as I do this is a fine example. With Sonja twirling on ice and Ethel belting that's a great combo. Enjoy, enjoy!!",1394841600,3,153,4.133333333333334
7833126,2,630298968X,"This is one of the sappiest of the Henie musicals to hit the screen.  Just watching the nonsense of the plot along with feeble acting by Ethel Merman, Cesar Romero and Don Ameche make you want to turn it off.  But wait!  There's more!  Uninspired music aand sub-par skating.  Miss this if you can",1385164800,,296,4.407407407407407
7833127,3,630298968X,"It's a good thing she could skate.  Not much of an actress, but still fun to watch her skate.  Quite a comparison to the skaters of today.",1372118400,,138,4.074074074074074
7833128,4,630298968X,"Forget the skating and the plot, for me the best part of the film is the musical speciality number, 'War Dance of the Wooden Indians', which features rare footage of Raymond Scott & his Quintette. Of particular interest and note is Scott's highly talented drummer, Johnny Williams, the late father of John Williams, the  movie theme composer ( 'Star Wars', etc.). Pure magic.",1189555200,6,375,4.9523809523809526
