8236111,5,B000ZN8072,"I was thrilled when I received my DVD of one of my favorite cartoons growing up.  The DVD is laid out so that you see 5 Heathcliff episodes, and then under Bonus Episodes, you get the Riff Raff / Cadillac Cats episodes. So they aren't laid out back to back the way the they were on TV, but still a total of 10 cartoons. The shipping was on time, and DVD & case were in good condition. Very pleased with the purchase.",1460160000,,416,4.073170731707317

8236116,4,B000ZN8072,"I grew up watching HEATHCLIFF after school everyday in the 80's...The theme song itself brings me joy! I wanted to cry wishing I was a kid again (Smile)
I bought this DVD not just for myself but for my kids to learn a little more about the cartoons I watched as a kid. Needless to say all three of my kids love the DVD so much even the tune is so catchy that I overheard my 6 year old humming to the theme song while brushing his teeth before bed...lol.
I recommend this DVD to every parent that have small children in their home. They will love HEATHCLIFF and most of all the theme song.
I just wish the DVD was subtitled or closed captioned for the hearing Impaired since I lost my hearing at 12 years old. I still do remember a little bit of the song though. (Smile)",1239062400,10,769,4.133333333333334
