8587016,5,B00CWT90FI,"This is a real collectors item. The included art prints and bonus features take me right back to the era this show came out. Makes the experience of watching this anime from my teenage years that much more special. What are you waiting for? ""Just who the hell do you think I am?!""",1510185600,,280,4.30188679245283

8587019,5,B00CWT90FI,"Awesome. Beast. Boss. Whatever you adjective you'd like to use fits, as this is an excellent box set. I like that the original soundtrack is included is just so awesome. The booklet, the posters, the stickers, the postcards are excellent additions, they all fit nicely into the box it comes in so it really isn't too difficult to remove them. The two sided poster makes its difficult to decide if one should hang it or take care of it and put it away, the same goes for the stickers. The illustration booklet is amazing, and its quite difficult to get tired of flipping through the pages. If you have the money to spend, you could go for the blu-ray, but I think this alternative just as great and worth the money.",1428105600,,714,4.458015267175573
8587020,4,B00CWT90FI,"I bought this somewhere else and it's great!  Bought it for my boyfriend, and I also got it cheaper. I spent $140 :P look for it somewhere else I'd say",1417392000,2,151,4.033333333333333
8587021,5,B00CWT90FI,"I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday, and to be perfectly honest, it's not a bad price at all. Sure, it might suck because you can obviously just torrent it for free, but people don't understand it is to support the franchize and all the hard work people put into this anime. Having the soundtrack, art book, and the little things is more than enough that make this an awesome purchase. I don't buy any anime usually unless I really want to support the series, and Gurren Lagann is 100% that kind of anime. If you can't afford the 200 purchase, then I'd advise go for DVD's and purchase the extras online seperate. Who knows, it may end up cheaper. Great purchase for oneself or a gift.",1412294400,2,691,4.448818897637795
8587022,4,B00CWT90FI,The anime is really good but the price is way too high.,1404604800,2,55,3.6666666666666665
8587023,5,B00CWT90FI,"There have been plenty of write ups about the show itself before, so for this review I'm going to be focusing on the box set itself. That said Gurren Lagann is my favorite anime series of all time, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of anime.

 Gurren Lagann is a show that I watched a couple of years ago and fell in love with. Ever since then I'd been hoping for a new box set to come out, since I had heard complaints about the Anime Legends box set from Bandai being defective. When this box set and the Blu Ray set were announced, I was disappointed by the price, but eventually I decided to go ahead and get this box set.

I am not disappointed in the least. All 27 episodes of the show are included in both English and Japanese audio on 6 discs. In addition, all 51 tracks from the show's soundtrack are included on two CDs. The DVDs work, and the quality of the visuals and audio is nice.

Ordinarily this would be enough, but the box set also comes with a number of other goodies. There is a small, two-sided poster that features both Yoko and Kamina, a small 35 page booklet filled with great illustrations from the show, 12 postcards that feature some of this great art, and two stickers that each feature one of Kamina's famous quotes.

In addition to all that, the box that contains all this content is beautiful art of the gunmen in the show that wraps around the entirety of the box.

With all this content, I felt both justified and satisfied in my decision to purchase this box set. If you are a fan of the show and are unsure about splurging on the Blu Ray set, then I highly recommend you go with this set instead.",1394582400,10,1647,4.229299363057325
