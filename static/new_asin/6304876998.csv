7901180,4,6304876998,"I had to write something, as of April 19 2013 there was no content information at all posted for this, just that you got 4 VHS tapes.  I recently bought this for fun and enjoyed it so I figure I'll put some info out to the cloud. I don't have the time to give a proper review of all the programming but I can give some technical details to help you search on your own.

To start you do get 4 vhs tapes containing three vintage made for TV UFO shows, one show is in two parts/tapes. The dust jacket for the 4 tapes credits American Home Treasures Inc, PO Box 1807 Englewood NJ 07631 and mentions Catalog #1435.  The ISBN is 1578750709 and UPC is 617873143538. Video quality is generally good but the tapes are recorded in SLP mode!

The first of the three programs I watched was ""UFO Factor"" run time 58 minutes, catalog number 1271, ISBN 157875013X, UPC 617873121734. Guessing from various in program comments/references, US produced late 1970s.  Actually the most interesting of the 3!

Program two, ""The Strange Case of Crop Circles"" circa 1993 UK produced.  Run time 52 minutes, Catalog number 1216.  ISBN 1578750105, UPC 617873121635.

Program three ""Dreamland Area 51"" on two tapes, 1996, Written, produced, directed, starring etc Bruce Burgess.  If you didn't already see it on Fox/Sky when X-Files was new, now is your chance.  Tape one run time 45 minutes, catalog number 1214, ISBN 1578750113, UPC 617873121437. Tape 2, 45 minutes, catalog 1215, 158750121 and 617873121536.",1366416000,,1482,4.75
