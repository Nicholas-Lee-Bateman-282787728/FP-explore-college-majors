986489,4,6305170444,"WWF Breakdown was held September 1998 at Hamilton's Copps Coliseum.  Every major WWF superstar took part in this event.  The main event was a Triple Threat Match for the WWF Title.  Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs.  Undertaker vs. Kane.  This is the first time that the WWF Champion lost his  title at an In Your House event.  However, the best match was the Triple  Threat Steel Cage Match between The Rock, Mankind, and Ken Shamrock.  The  winner becomes the number one contender for the WWF Championship.  Other  matches include:  Edge vs. Owen Hart, D-Lo Brown vs. Gangrel, X-Pac and the  New Age Outlaws vs. Jeff Jarrett and Southern Justice, and many more...  Since I was at this event, I got to experience it the way it was meant to  be.  LIVE!!!  WWF Breakdown is a must-see for any true WWF fan.",913420800,,808,4.570422535211268

7884973,2,6305170444,"1.) Owen Hart vs Edge

We start with a decent match from Owen and Edge. Christian makes his WWF debut towards the end, appearing out of nowhere from the crowd. Jim Ross describes him as someone who looks like Edge. The distraction allows Owen to roll Edge up with the tights for the win as Christian disappears back into the crowd

2.) Too Much vs 2 Cold Scorpio and Al Snow

Filler PPV match. Nothing more to be said about it. Al Snow wins the match with a Snow Plow on Scott Taylor

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Marc Mero w/Jacqueline vs Droz

Another filler match added to the card without much thought. Jacqueline hits Droz with her shoe behind the referee's back and Mero capitalizes with the Marvelocity for the win

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) No Holds Barred Match: Vader vs Bradshaw

This was a relatively stiff match to say the least and wasn't necessarily bad but it wasn't really perfect at all either. So we'll just put it as average. The biggest reason being that Bradshaw was still a cookie-cutter type of wrestler who didn't yet have an established gimmick and Vader was pretty much being used to put over others at this point in his career. For a No Holds Barred match, it certainly did lack weapons that surely looked to have been brought out in this match. The match ends on a disappointing note when Bradshaw gets the win over Vader with a neckbreaker. Really? A match like this one and it ends with the use of a basic, generic move like a neckbreaker?

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) D'Lo Brown vs Gangrel

Fair but short match from Gangrel and D'Lo. Match starts off at a nice pace but comes to a halt mid-way though. Mark Henry interferes towards the end and attacks Gangrel while the referee's back is turned. D'Lo takes advantage of the situation and hits the Lo Down on Gangrel to pick up the win. Gangrel gets the last laugh however as he rolls back in the ring, following the match and spits blood into the face of Henry and drops D'Lo with a DDT

6.) Steel Cage Match: Mankind vs Ken Shamrock vs The Rock

Very fun and exciting match to watch here! With the winner of the match being guaranteed to be the #1 Contender for the WWF Championship, there was something worth fighting for in this Cage match. Three of the Attitude Era's best beating the stuffing out of each other in this compelling bout. Lots of double team combination moves performed throughout with each superstar teaming with another at some point in the match. Mankind looks to have the match won by climbing over the cage but it's The Rock who gets the pinfall over Shamrock before Mankind drops to the floor. Dynamic match here that defined what the Attitude Era was all about; exciting wrestling

7.) Dustin Runnels vs Val Venis w/Terri

Over the summer, Goldust had turned away from his bizzare ways and began using his real name, Dustin Runnels, and transitioned over to an evangelist; claiming he was a born again. Not too long after this, he discovered that his wife, Terri had an affair with Val Venis. Looking for revenge, Dustin challenged Venis to a match. Meh match for me. Didn't really deliver for the most part in my opinion. Venis gets the win with the Money Shot on Dustin

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Southern Justice and Jeff Jarrett vs The New Age Outlaws and X-Pac

Less than stellar tag match which was a shame because I really expected more out of this match. Bill Gunn hits the Fameasser on Dennis Knight for the win

9.) WWF Championship Handicap Match: Kane and The Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)

This match was deemed as Mr. McMahon's ""Master Plan"" and that it was. After numerous failed attempts at trying to get the WWF Championship off of Steve Austin, McMahon finally thought of a way to get the championship off of him. Book Austin in a Handicap Match against the WWF's demonic duo; the Brothers of Destruction; Kane and The Undertaker. McMahon made a guarantee that when it was over, Stone Cold would no longer be champion. With the odds highly stacked against him, Austin starts the match early, jumping Undertaker from behind with a steel chair on his way to the ring. Undertaker and Kane work over Austin for a good chunk of the match; but once greed sets in over who should pin Austin, they don't hesitate turning on each other. Just as Austin seems to finish both men off, he gets caught with a double Chokeslam from Taker and Kane and they both pin him for the win---but who's the winner? McMahon steals the championship from ringside and escapes the arena with it. A great main event to end the show with amazing storytelling and an awesome and classic Attitude Era twist to keep fans on the edge of their seats until the following night's Raw

Overall: A pretty standard PPV to be honest. Way too many filler matches taking up time and space on the PPV with only matches towards the last half of the PPV really having any major significance to it. 1998 was probably the best year for the WWF, but Breakdown was probably their worst PPV they had that year. It seemed that they gave all their time building the main event and the match surrounding the main event that they forgot to focus on the PPV as a whole. The Triple Threat Cage match and main event WWF Championship match are practically the only 2 matches worthy of being watched. Everything else was pretty much throwaway or filler",1412035200,,6077,5.343815513626835

September 27, 1998

Copps Coliseum

Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

Edge V. Owen Hart

Awesome opener. I really don't like Edge was a performer, but if you get him in there that can carry his ass, he looks like a million bucks and that's what happened here. Owen...R.I.P. Buddy, you are truely missed. Owen wins and gives Edge his first **** star match.

Too Much V. Al Snow & Scorpio

The JOB Squad won this match?...their Job IS to Job. Ok...whatever. ***

No Holds Barred Match:

Vader V. Bradshaw

ok match that had some very good spots in it actually. Bradshaw wins ** and speaking of JOBS...is seems like since No Way Out Vader have been doing to JOB everytime he was on PPV. Weird.

D'Lo Brown V. Gangrel

Short and thank god, Gangrel sucks. It's a good thing that D'Lo won. *1/2

Triple Threat Steel Cage Match:

Mankind V. The Rock V. ken Shamrock

Very cool cage match. I wonder why Vince doesn't do more Triple Threat Cage Matches. I think it's unique. The Rock wins. ***3/4

Val Venis V. Dustin Runnels

Look at what Terri isn't wearing. Very hott...AH, i just got slapped in the head by my wife...what I'm a guy..the day we stop looking is the day we die. It's the truth. Anyways, the match was ok and everyone was looking at Terri anyways so we are all winners. actually Val wins. **

X-Pac & New Age Outlaws V. Jeff Jarrett & Southern Justice

Good match that could have been better. DX wins. ***

Triple Threat Match for the WWF Championship:

Stone Cold Steve Austin (Champion) V. Undertaker V. Kane

One of my favorite matches. Great storyline and both Undie and Kane pin Austin at the same time and Finkle doesn't know who to announce as the new champ. ****1/4

Overall, a very good show with a very hott opener, two awesome triple threat matches and one very hott Terri Runnels as always.",1138752000,2,1829,4.492401215805471
7884975,4,6305170444,"WWF Breakdown was a great PPV. It was exciting from the opening match to the contreversial main event. Edge and Owen Hart face off in the Tortured Soul-vs-Sole Survivor match in which Christian makes his debut. Al Snow and Scorpio take on Too Much in a tag match. Marc Mero faces Droz and Gangrel takes on D'Lo Brown. Bradshaw and Vader have a match which is No-Holds Barred and Falls Count Anywhere. In the first of the 2 triple threat matches The Rock,Ken Shamrock,and Mankind wrestle in a cage. And in the main event Steve Austin takes on both Undertaker and Kane for the WWF Championship. It's a great match with a suprise ending. I think that is all the matches but if there is more I'm sorry for that. Just go buy the video.",1012521600,,730,4.4148148148148145

7884977,3,6305170444,"Every since Steve Austin won the WWF title at Wrestlemania 14 Vince McMahon has tried to 'mold' his new champion, trying to re-shape him into a  more flexiable corporate Rattlesnake. But each attempt failed. So Vince  McMahon has revealed his Masterplan to rid the WWF of the Texas  Rattlesnake. Kane and Undertaker - the single most destructive force in the  history of the WWF - have formed a deadly alliance. Led by McMahon the two  have set their sights on Austin and more importantly the WWF title. All  they have to do is co-exist for twenty minutes and destroy Stone Cold. But  when a beaten and semi-conscious Austin lays flat on his back in the middle  on the ring, the demonic brothers begin arguing over who should get the  pin... the main event is the only appealing match on the card, as is often  the case, this video serves merely as a stepping stone between two  storylines. Not very good viewed on it's own but a great build up to the  next pay-per-view: Judgment Day.",966211200,,985,4.565714285714286
