8571444,4,B00BNAE3SQ,"`Warbirds of WWII' has 3 discs containing films and information about many of the planes that were used in WWII. Some fighters and bombers have been omitted which a shame. Bombers such as the B-26 Marauder had some of the qualities of a fighter along with its bombing capabilities and there is no information about it.

There are films from the time including during the fighting itself and some training films. Pilots and a few other crewmen give interviews concerning their experiences. What was especially interesting were their tales of the quirks and tricks they had to use to fly these planes.
One of the main problems with the film is that there are no subtitles/captions. Some of the men are hard to understand and also many of the audience that would like to see this set are of an age when their hearing isn't what it used to be.

I am all for giving these men their due and glory, their minute in the sun, but the film seems to spend most of its time just with these men talking to the camera. It would have made for much more interesting viewing to show some film clips as they talked, rather than the viewer sitting and watching a person talking into the camera.
On one disc we do get to see and listen to men from the RAF, the Canadian forces and Germans.
This is an interesting set for those who like history and want to learn more details about the planes that flew in WWII.",1389398400,,1390,4.404669260700389
