8085470,2,B000BD989A,"Not your usual surf film.  If you are just looking for lots of waves, fun music and great maneuvers, this is not the film for you.  The film goes through a daily routine of professional (yet unsponsored) surf champion Pauline Menczer with other female surfers, and makes a great point that it is completely wrong that a female surfer of this caliber has not received a sponsor.  It demonstrates the lack of support for women's as compared to mens surfing.  Unfortunately, between the lengthy unnecessary off-beach scenes and the annoyingly feminine commentary, it was difficult for my husband and I to sit through, unlike the other 20+ quality surf films we own.  I will most likely give it away, but at least it made a good point.",1248739200,,731,4.724409448818897
