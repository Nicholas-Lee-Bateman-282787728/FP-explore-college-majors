5434476,2,B00AIM3PZ2,"I have all of the powerstrike kickboxing workouts. Usually, they are great. I love Illaria as an instructor. This is a good workout but the production is awful. You can't hear the instructions half the time- makes it hard to follow. It's too bad because I was so excited to get a new powerstrike workout.",1361059200,5,304,4.545454545454546
5434477,1,B00AIM3PZ2,I had to return this workout.  The production was terrible.  It was grainy and I could not hear the instructors cues.  The outfits the men were wearing were distracting...and not in a good way. E[...],1358121600,4,200,4.6571428571428575
5434478,3,B00AIM3PZ2,"As usual, Ilaria gives a great workout.  Unfortunately, the production is terrible.  The music is very loud, distracting and overpowers Ilaria's voice, making it very difficult to follow the instructions.  I have to wonder if anyone listened to the DVD before selling it?  Very disappointing.",1357084800,6,292,5.4222222222222225

8552182,3,B00AIM3PZ2,"Love powerstrike,  however you really to be heavily coordinated to do this one. Which I'm not. No time for error or mistake to catch up. No your routines before starting this.",1492992000,,175,4.645161290322581
8552183,5,B00AIM3PZ2,"As with all her videos, Illaria is amazinG. Like anything else, it takes some persistence and practice but the workout is good, well paced and fun!",1431216000,,147,4.6923076923076925
8552184,5,B00AIM3PZ2,"This is one of the best kickboxing workouts dvds out there. It is definitely for the advanced kickboxing exerciser, with more complicated and faster movements than in Ilaria's previous powerstrike workouts. There are also barely any rests in this one. However, if you master the moves, this workout is super fun! The hour flew by and left me completely dripping in sweat. I've been working out to kickboxing dvds from Tae Bo to Turbo Fire, and just recently discovered Powerstrike. I wish I had found out about her sooner! I had done powerstrike 4, 5 and 6 a few times before doing Vol 7. This dvd will definitely be in my workout rotation. Highly recommended for advanced kickboxers.",1420156800,,684,4.805084745762712
8552185,5,B00AIM3PZ2,"This is a real workout. Ilaria does not mess around. Simple moves built into complex combinations make this workout a challenge, and a blast. Very little pep, just intense drills and reps of actual martial arts kicks and punches. Whatever your level of fitness, I promise you will feel this.",1412553600,,291,4.84
8552186,5,B00AIM3PZ2,"I really enjoy this workout.  This is the fourth Powerstrike Kickboxing DVD that I have purchased. Volume 5 was the best but this is my second favorite.

8552187,1,B00AIM3PZ2,"I do a lot of kickboxing videos and I have to say this is one of the worst I have found. I was really hoping to like it because I loved Powerstrike Vol. 6, but where as Vol. 6 had great direction, Vol. 7 had absolutely none. I pick up combinations pretty easily but in this video it was impossible to pick up the combinations because of the speed and also you are not able to hear the instructor. The musicality was also off. Overall it was very disappointing.",1403827200,,460,4.179775280898877
8552188,2,B00AIM3PZ2,"I love the effort that Ilia puts forth in her videos but Vol. 7 is very difficult to keep up with and the music is way too fast. Unfortunately, I won't use my Vol. 7 again because her movements aren't timed to the eight-count beat and her combinations are just not seamless and smooth.  I believe Volumes 5 and 6 are much better.",1385856000,3,329,4.222222222222222
8552189,4,B00AIM3PZ2,"I love the Powerstrike kickboxing series. I have found Volume 7 to be the most challenging of the series so far, for a number of reasons. First of all the punching and kicking sequences are more involved than the others in the series. The combos were fun and more challenging as well. Get ready to do well over a hundred crescent kicks. I do have a complaint with Volume 7, which is the production value is a little lower standard than the others in the series. I felt like the music was a little ""off"" while doing the workout, and every once in a while the instructor's voice was muffled. The music being ""off"" threw me off the first time I worked out with this DVD, but on my second time through I had no problems adjusting to it. I would not recommend this DVD for folks at a beginner fitness level, and would recommend being familiar with at least one of the previous Powerstrike DVDs before deciding to try this one.",1378166400,4,921,4.3604651162790695
8552190,2,B00AIM3PZ2,"I like the others was so excited that she came out with a new DVD, as Powerstrike 6,5 and 4 are all fun, great workouts and excellent instruction. This one, as the others say- the production and sound are horrible, the music beat dosn't go well with the work out, and she tried to cram to many fancy moves into one workout- making it - difficult to manuever through. I wouldn't spend my money again on this one.",1372896000,7,411,4.282051282051282
