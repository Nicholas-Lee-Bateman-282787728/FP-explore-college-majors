8397620,4,B003IP2YGW,"This is artistically probably the best film ever made about Callas. I have seen most of the others and this focusses more on her life than the music itself. Technically it has understandably poor sound and video for the clips of her singing but its biggest flaw is the shambolic subtitle arrangements. There are no French or English subtitles for any of the French or English narration whether you choose the French or English audio track. French and English only kick in when those interviewed are speaking in a non English language. This is ridiculous. If you want to identify the many names that appear throughout the 97 minute film then turn on the German, Dutch etc. subtitles but as soon as another language appears you must either understand the subtitles you are using or switch back to English. What a shambles! Further more the idiot that designed this mess did not think to add a short title telling you what the extract being sung was. For this you must wait until the end or perhaps pause at the end, write them all down and have it handy as the film progresses. What a lost opportunity. If you have perfect hearing and know all the music you may not mind very much but for most of us this is a stupid and quite serious shortcoming in what is otherwise a masterly film about the most astonishing soprano of the 20th century.",1390003200,10,1337,4.551867219917012

8397622,1,B003IP2YGW,"Overrated, soprano Maria Callas was a spoiled, haughty woman who rubbed elbow grease with the rich and idiotic. This drudging mock-documentary from director Philippe Kohly is a complete bore. It doesn't do much to cast any revealing information about Callas, who seems to have gone through life with a complaint against everything. There's a few pieces of Paparazzi interviews and camera moments that are out of place. None of them are translated into English. In all, it makes for a monotonous viewing.

Assoluta = absolute; supreme but this mock-documentary is anything but.",1384732800,,576,5.260869565217392
8397623,5,B003IP2YGW,"When I ordered this disc, I was afraid it would prove to be a mixture of material that has been available for years, first on VHS tapes and then on DVDs. But I was delighted to discover that, along with some familiar material, there was enough that was new to me to keep the disc interesting. The picture quality is definitely an improvement over anything that has preceded it. For anyone interested in Callas, I strongly recommend this disc.",1282694400,14,442,4.6075949367088604

8397625,3,B003IP2YGW,"Fully agree with E. Puzzo review, and furthermore, nothing that we have not already seen, heard or read.
But if you are an avid collector of Callas related things as I am, then buy it.
It's not a waste by any means, still enjoyable.",1259193600,7,232,4.295454545454546
8397626,3,B003IP2YGW,"For a year Philippe Kohly set out to accomplish what most filmmakers and opera buffs would shy away from.  He took on the daunting task of researching the life and career of La Divina herself - Miss Maria Callas - in order to shed some light on her life.  The interviews, home videos and photographs do a good job in giving insight to the personal and professional sides of Callas.  However, the editing did not do the film any justice.  It is choppy and jumps around leaving very visible seams.  When they used sound bites of Callas, the photos and home videos were a nice treat.  At other times, it seemed like they ran out of clips and just showed a mannequin spinning around with costumes Callas wore in some of her most famous roles.  That's fine once, but after several times, it was a little much.  On the whole I enjoyed the film, but I don't think this is the best Callas documentary I have seen.",1255996800,20,905,4.377245508982036
