419302,4,6302041082,I thought I saw all of rob lowes movies. I was surprised to see this one. This movie was mildly funny and cute in a 1980's way.  I am a long time fan of jennifer grey and rob lowe so this was a surprise to see. He's a fashion designer looking for something more (in fashion and life) and jennifer grey is looking for her home made fashions to be discovered. Through in some magic and you have a very cute film.,1036195200,3,410,4.0

419304,4,6302041082,"I saw this movie under the title 'If The Shoe Fits' and found it to be an engaging twist on the Cinderella story.  If a bit choppy at times (which I'll blame on editing) I thought Rob was gorgeous and Jennifer beautiful,  sensible and in love.  Though not well-made, it certainly was enjoyable to  watch and is a film I have passed along to friends interested in a funny,  charming picture to pass the time with.",960940800,7,412,4.368421052631579

7820261,3,6302041082,"I purchased this movie because it was one my now grown daughter and I enjoyed watching when she was younger.  I thought we'd get a kick out of it.  Now that it is a classic, I spent more on the movie than I would have liked for a used ViHS.  We have yet to watch it together but I did a private screening for myself and it was as I remembered it.  Now I have one of those 80's movies in my collection.  I would like to see it out in dvd format",1364428800,,443,3.7204301075268815
7820262,5,6302041082,"First off, I absolutely love this movie!! I already had a copy of this wonderful movie, but it is almost worn out. I wanted to get another copy, and I was so thankful I found it here. This movie is wonderful, and great for the whole family, even children can watch it.
It is a modern day cinderella story, about a fashion designer who wants to get recognized for her work, but can't. She is a plain woman, played by the beautiful Jennifer Grey, who has a slight crush on the fashion designer, Salvatore, and also wants to design shoes. After meeting her fairy godmother, on a rotten day, she receives the help she needs to fit in a world controlled by beauty. Once she recieves help, she catches the eye of Salvatore, and she then turns into the one thing she despised. She becomes a victim of beauty, but in the end, she overcomes this and is accepted by Salvatore. He calls her his inspiration!
I know this is not the best summary or review, but it is a great movie. Hard to find, but it is a diamond in the rough. If you can find it, try it out. I guarrantee you will not be disappointed, not much anyway.",1353974400,,1108,4.2559241706161135

7820265,5,6302041082,"I first saw this on Disney Channel (when they didn't have commercials) and the title was ""If The Shoe Fits"". There were a few scenes cut out for slight nudity and dubbed dialogue for slight profanity. My favorite character is the Fairy Godmother who acts likes she's lost. The movie as a whole might be a little corny and predictable, but I still enjoy it.",1056931200,4,356,4.492307692307692
