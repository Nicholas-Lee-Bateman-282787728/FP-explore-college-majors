2115983,5,B0002Q9SIC,"The Sarah series is great family viewing. I love the feel of it and redeeming values.
It's a wonderful movie for anyone who wants to know what real marriage is about.",1358208000,,166,4.387096774193548
2115984,5,B0002Q9SIC,I bought this for our classroom to watch after reading the book.  Our kids loved it.  It went right along with the book.,1358208000,,120,4.173913043478261
2115985,5,B0002Q9SIC,"What impresses me the most about the Sarah, Plain and Tall movies is the utter believability of them.  I have never, ever seen movies which feel so totally authentic, like actual people's lives, as this trilogy.  The camerawork/cinematography and music are appropriately restrained, but are very expressive at the same time.  The acting feels so natural to me as a viewer, too.  To me, the films are as much genius as endearing.",1307664000,2,428,4.902777777777778
2115986,5,B0002Q9SIC,"Usually sequels do not work, but this one, it continues the story beautifully and gets you more interested in the family. I used this also in class with my fifth graders after we read and watch Sarah, Plain and Tall and they absolutely loved it. Good family viewing.",1279670400,,266,4.5625
2115987,5,B0002Q9SIC,"My order was received when specified and in great condition.  The price was good as I compared pricing.  I order from Amazon quite often and I am always satisfied with the service and product that I receive. Of course, I also like that I am able to track my order.",1265760000,,264,4.26
2115988,4,B0002Q9SIC,"She lives here now... Sarah is back.
Except for Christopher Walken trying to play a mid-westerner with a New York accent, the acting here is very good.
This is a farming dry earth story.
What are you going to do when the well runs dry and the barn burns down?
She ends up writing her name in the dirt.",1231977600,,301,4.11864406779661
2115989,3,B0002Q9SIC,"If you enjoyed the first of Hallmark's Sarah, Plain and Tall, the sequel Skylark is not a disappointment.  Once again, both Close and Walken break our stereo-types of them and give fine performances as the stoic, yet ""deeply-devoted"" couple.  A few cheesy moments by supporting cast, but not a big detraction.

The one major flaw to this DVD - the transfer job is really, really bad.  It's so bad you're better off saving a few dollars and getting on VHS.  It's a shame because some of the Northport. Maine location shots are quite beautiful.",1127520000,14,542,4.723404255319149
2115990,4,B0002Q9SIC,"A beautiful follow-up to Sarah, Plain and Tall.  There is nothing like family and helping one another through the challenges of life.",1440547200,,133,5.045454545454546
2115991,5,B0002Q9SIC,"Skylark is a great book, and so I was skeptical about the movie.  I usually hate it when I read a good book and then watch how a movie ruins the characters and the story.  I like this movie though.  The makers remained true to the book and Glenn Close and Christopher Walken are great.",1436832000,,285,4.1454545454545455

2116006,4,B0002Q9SIC,There is one scene where Glenn Close is off the deep end--that should have been cut from film. But aside from that-the story follows along closely with the first and that's good.,1381190400,,178,4.59375
