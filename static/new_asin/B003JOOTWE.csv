4131231,1,B003JOOTWE,The movie is extremely slow and boring and features the misadventures of a stupid guy and an insane sociopath girl.  There is nothing redeeming about this movie.,1361923200,,161,4.962962962962963
4131232,4,B003JOOTWE,"Did not know what to expect but it was good. I pretty much figured the end to be what I thought but otherwise, it was pleasant. The young lady in the film was hilarious. I think we all have this person in us or know this person personally and emotionally. different type of movie that was really good. Thanks for the option and for some this is a will be a delight.",1360454400,2,365,4.083333333333333
4131233,5,B003JOOTWE,"Soooo good!

 My mom phoned me right in the middle of the big reveal between 'The Locksmith' and his ex and I could have ripped my hair out!  I was dying to find out what she said to him!  I finally got back to the movie and the end did not disappoint.  The characters were believable, the acting superb, the plot wasn't overly complicated.....bravissimo!",1358121600,,355,4.484375
4131234,5,B003JOOTWE,I really enjoyed the movie and really could relate to the characters and situations.  The use of NYC as station for this journey was brilliant!,1353456000,2,143,4.72
4131235,5,B003JOOTWE,"Richardson and Reeder give tours des forces in this whip smart debut feature from festival favorite filmmakers Todd & Brad Barnes. Cleverly scripted, impressively acted - a refreshing break from the typical Julia-goes-to-India rom com rigamarole.  The Barnes' are forces to be reckoned with - keep an eye out for them.",1285200000,2,318,5.235294117647059
4131236,5,B003JOOTWE,"I caught this awesome little film at Sundance this year. It's funny, sweet, and features some great performances and a sunny side of New York rarely shown on film. A perfect, breezy rom-com!",1285027200,2,190,4.787878787878788

8398363,3,B003JOOTWE,Crazy woman.,1465948800,,12,5.5
8398364,5,B003JOOTWE,"This movie could be a cultural barometer for its viewers.  The female lead is a troublesome, frustrating character, but she's also a living, breathing, feeling woman who is dealing with a souring relationship.  Is she funny and charming, or just crazy?  Different people see it differently, and maybe that says as much about their own character as it does hers.",1395964800,,361,4.983333333333333
8398365,5,B003JOOTWE,wonderful film .... charming and very watchable.  The three leads all turn in compelling performances and the direction is top shelf ... watch this movie!,1390089600,,154,5.16
8398366,5,B003JOOTWE,"I love coming across little independent films that aren't so pretentious. The storyline is hilarious, and very well acted. It's one of our go-to DVDs when there's nothing else to watch, or just for the heck of it.

""It's ok, it's ok, it's ok... we're gonna drink orange soda now."" HAH!",1389312000,,285,4.588235294117647
8398367,5,B003JOOTWE,"Oh that Margo! She's so crazy but sweet and Mike is trying to do the right thing. He's got a big heart and sweet soul, the eternal romantic... It's a fun movie and you'll be yelling ""Run, Mike, RUN!"" also when you see his moment to get away! Laugh out loud funny.",1389312000,,263,4.076923076923077
8398368,1,B003JOOTWE,"Was this girl supposed to be drunk or high on prescription meds? I'm confused. I understood the message of the film by the end, but was totally turned off (and even a little offended since I'm a white girl dating a black man)by the sloppy vibe the female lead projected and passive role the male played. Why did they have to make the girl ditzy and fat? Did they do that on purpose? It just rubbed me the wrong way.",1383177600,,415,4.2
8398369,5,B003JOOTWE,"I added this to see what it was about and i thought I was gonna be disappointed, but it was a very sweet movie, loved the main characters. Story line was great and the message was insightful. I loved the chemistry, everything about this movie was entertaining. The beginning was hilarious!!!!!!!!! This movie didn't disappoint.",1376697600,2,327,4.963636363636364
