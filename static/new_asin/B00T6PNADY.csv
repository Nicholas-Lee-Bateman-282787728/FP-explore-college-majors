8700632,2,B00T6PNADY,"We only made it halfway through this very dark and depressing movie before we gave up. The main protagonist is a beautiful 9 year old boy who just bounces from one brutal encounter to another with selfish, incompetent or abusive adults.  The acting is quite good, but I just could not stand anymore scenes of abuse committed against the poor child.  So we turned it off.",1440201600,,370,4.590909090909091
8700633,2,B00T6PNADY,"It takes a sick mind to write these stories. I hope it was therapeutic for the guy who wrote this. I'm not sure I believe it's a true story. It simply says it is, bu a lot of stupid haunting-themed movies say that, too. It's a s*** movie not worth watching, but at least it has a good cast. Paul Sorvino as a Rabbi. That was funny. And a good representation of how Jewish holy men can be just as perverted as a holy man of any other religion.",1439942400,,442,3.9775280898876404
8700634,4,B00T6PNADY,"A true story about the trials and tribulations of being a Russian Immigrant in the 70's and the difficulties this Jewish Russian family had to endure. I was never a big fan of Harry Hamlin; however, I must say, he was spectacular in this role. This movie put's things into perspective for me and makes me appreciate what a great, easy life I have compared to what this husband and father (Harry Hamlin) went through trying to find a decent job in NYC in the 70's. He was an engineer in Russia; in America, he was a nobody that couldn't get a decent job.
He loved his family but couldn't handle not being able to provide an adequate life and as a result, alcohol took over his life and created a downward spiral that quickly got out of control.",1434585600,,743,4.35251798561151
