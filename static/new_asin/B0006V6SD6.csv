8324237,5,B0006V6SD6,"I have been using the Infant Massage Lessons for Dads DVD with my six-week old daughter for the last five weeks.  We have made her massage part of the bedtime ritual, usually doing the massage right before she is put down to sleep.  The massage has helped her relax before we put her in her pajamas, and makes the transition from being with us to her crib much easier.  I have also enjoyed the bonding experience with my daughter.

The DVD starts with a brief introduction, detailing all the items you'll need for the session, and then John and two other dads complete a massage session with their infants.  John explains each technique in detail while giving some helpful hints along the way.  There is also an extra interview that explains the benefits of continuing massage as your children grow older.  This is definitely the easiest way to get started with infant massage, and a great way for dads to bond with their babies.",1113868800,11,929,4.628048780487805
