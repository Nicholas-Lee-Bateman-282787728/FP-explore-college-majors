1666188,4,B00005UQ78,"The first time I have watched this movie, I figured it was bad. The second time had watched this movie, it's worth 4 stars. I have seen better Shaw Brothers movies. Nonetheless, the story from I Kuang is always brillant.",1094083200,,220,4.525
1666189,5,B00005UQ78,"Shaolin Mantis (bizarrely also titled Deadly Mantis in this 1983 print)is widely recognized as one of David Chiang Da Wei's best efforts at the Shaw studio, and deservedly so;  it is one of the few not directed by perennial favourite Chang Cheh and therefore has far more character development, intricate sets and cinematography, and even numerous female characters; all features famously lacking from Cheh's beloved comic-book style.  This is also one of the first and best movies to use the device of copying animals to create a fighting style and the painful training sequences that ensue.  The synopsis can be found elsewhere, and I believe nearly any aficionado of these films would give it all five stars.
The one issue is the print quality: this ""Platinum Collector's Edition"" literally opens with video jitter, showing plainly that it was transferred from video (probably someone's home copy), not from film, and it is entirely ""pan and scan,"" which makes it difficult to follow the action, and not only in the action scenes.  That said, it should not prevent you buying it... it is regrettable, though, that in the age of DVDs, collectors and lovers of these films are still forced to content themselves with mediocre, ""Black Belt Theatre""-type copies.  Don't miss this one, by all means!  But don't expect any extra features, and don't expect the print to be better than the one you taped at midnight a couple of years ago. NOTE: A HONG KONG COMPANY CALLED CELESTIAL IS REMASTERING AND RERELEASING THE ENTIRE SHAW FILM LIBRARY ON DVD!  BEAUTIFUL LUSH PRINTS IN ORIGINAL LANGUAGES WITH DECENT SUBTITLES!  IF YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON THEM, GET THIS ONE! (note: you will need a region-free or all-region DVD player if you do not live in Asia!)",1019001600,24,1751,4.911864406779661
1666190,5,B00005UQ78,"Forced into being a Ching spy (David Chiang) is sent to infiltrate a family that is suspected of being revolutionaries. He falls in love with the daughter (Li Li-Li) and marries her. Soon after the spy finds out that the family members are revolutionaries, the family discovers the true identity of thier new son in-law and for their daughter's sake allow him to stay with them but will not let him leave thier home. Time is running out and the spy must get back to the Ching Emperior to report or his parents will be killed. The spy convinces his wife he needs to leave to visit his family. He and his wife fight side by side against her family and she is killed in the battle. He goes and creates a new style of kungfu while in hiding called mantis fist. He then returns to avenge his wife and manages to defeat the rest of the family. When he returns home with his job complete he has an interesting surprise waiting for him.
The DVD quality is what is you can expect from from a dubbed VCR tape to DVD. This is quite normal for a movie of this type and any true kung fu movie collector wouldn't worry about this.
I rate movies based upon the content, the actors, and costumes and humour. The quality of the DVD has little to do with how I rate these types of movies.
This type of movie is nothing like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Iron Monkey. If your looking for movies like that don't bother watching this.",1012694400,4,1417,4.310861423220974
1666200,1,B00005UQ78,"A Qing official is sent an order to expose a Ming-favoring clan. He's only given one year before his family is killed. He infiltrates the clan as a innocent teacher for the patriarch's granddaughter, and it all goes bad from there.

The kung fu is ok, but the story is just a mess, with one of the most unsatisfying endings I've seen in a kung-fu film and an unlikable protagonist. The film has some fresh ideas...not many would star one of the disliked Qing. But it doesnt go far enough, and ends up a disappointment. It's still a watchable film, but not one you may like at the end.",1492387200,2,584,4.3577981651376145

1666312,4,B00005UQ78,"As far as kung fu cinema goes, this movie was important for 2 reasons. The first and most obvious reason is that it essentially introduces the praying mantis style of kung-fu fighting. Secondly the fight choreography in this movie is really excellent.

Each move is made with such precision, that one wrong move during the weapons battles could seriously injure someone (even if they were just using plastic). The fight scene finale where the Mantis style is pitted against the Shadow style is definitely worth a watch.",1399420800,2,519,4.9655172413793105

1666334,3,B00005UQ78,"Man, where to start?  This is one of the few Shaw Brothers classics that I had not previously owned or seen, even in bootleg form.  I had heard mixed things about it so I tried to keep my expectations in check.  A difficult task given the bizarre themes and esoteric behavior of most of the characters.  While I try to judge old-school fu mostly on the fighting, I have a tendency to grow very annoyed if a story succeeds in pulling me in... only to let me down!

David Chiang (""Boxer From Shantung"") plays Wei Feng, a scholar and martial arts student whose father is an influential guard for the Qing Emperor.  The Emperor orders Wei Feng to infiltrate the Tian Clan and obtain a list of Ming loyalists to crush their potential uprising.  If Wei Feng doesn't return in 3 months, his father will be stripped of his rank. At 6 months, the whole family gets imprisoned!  12 months?  They will ALL be beheaded!  No pressure there!  He journeys to the Clan's Five Sun Manor and ends up being recruited by Zhizhi (Cecilia Wong, ""Way of the Black Dragon""), the granddaughter of the Clan's patriarch (Lau Kar Wing, ""Knockabout""), to be her scholarly teacher, as she has chased away the previous 18 with her mischievous kung fu skills!  Wei Feng pretends to not know how to fight and accepts the job.

There's a TON more to the story that I won't spoil for those interested.  I will say that he'll have to fight his way out of Five Sun Manor to prevent his family's execution, develop the title's style (and my namesake) to counteract the Clan's Shadow Technique, and fight his way BACK into Five Sun Manor!  Much to my frustration, not necessarily in that order!  Adding to the list of liabilities is the under-use of the great Lily Li Li (""Disciples of the 36th Chamber"") as Zhizhi's mother and an ending that could've prevented ALL the film's tragedy with a little communication!  Imagine Shakespeare tackling a ""Three's Company"" episode!

Well, the fights are choreographed by the director, Lau Kar Leung (""Heroes of the East""), who's known for his authentic depictions of kung fu and is himself a bona fide master of Hung Gar (Tiger/Crane).  He has done better choreography but I've not seen a better fighting performance given by David Chiang.  This film has a decent amount of fisticuffs for a flick that's more story-based.  Lots of weapons and some hand-to-hand.  The flick opens with Wei Feng proving his skills to the Emperor by squaring off against brief appearances by monk Gordon Liu (""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"") and Lee Hoi San (just about EVERY old-school flick) as a Mongol warrior.  In general, the fights are pretty good for the late-70s with plenty of shapes!

Dragon Dynasty's release is curiously devoid of ANY special features and that seems to be the trend they've decided to set with their recent versions of Shaw Brothers flicks.  While that IS a complaint, I am happy with the lower price tag and burgeoning selection of classic, legitimate fu, particularly Lau Kar Leung's titles.  This one has a fantastic, BEAUTIFULLY remastered, widescreen picture with spoken languages available in Mandarin or English and subtitles available in English, Spanish, and English SDH.  If this tickles your fancy, I would act SOON as the company's future is questionable.  They haven't updated their site or catalog in months despite a half-dozen releases this year and a lot of their older titles are no longer available.

I hesitate to say I enjoyed it but it will receive more viewings and it's definitely interesting.  This film was meant to elicit a specific response and was likely not originally prescribed for a western audience.  That being said, I would recommend it mainly to old-school aficionados and those curious about 17th century China.

1666337,5,B00005UQ78,"Probably one of the Best Martial Arts movies depicting Praying Mantis Kung Fu! David Chiang at his finest with some nice moves. The story line is entertaining, especially when David's character develops Praying Mantis style while observing the animal. A classic Shaw Brothers film that should be part of your collection. Great choreography (old School style) no quick cuts in every punch or extreme closeups where you cant tell what the martial artist are doing, like in most modern MA films. If you like Mantis Style Kung Fu check out ""Dance of the Drunken Mantis"" and ""Prying Mantis Kung Fu""",1291680000,4,593,4.94
1666338,5,B00005UQ78,"This is one of the all time, all around, most realistically done martial arts films.  A film about the origins of Mantis Fist kung fu.  The fighting in this film is second to none.  I have over five hundred of the classic martial arts films released from the 40s to the 1980s.  This film is a testament to weapons interplay as well as Mantis Fist, hand to hand martial arts combat.  David Chiang worked very hard in this film.  Liu Chia Yung (Liu Chia Liang's real life brother and also directed this film) is the main rival.  Liu Chia Hui (the liu's adopted brother Gordon Liu is in the beginning of this film as a Shaolin Monk).  You have to see this film to know what quality martial arts cinema really is.  The ending duels between the different weapons are intentionally paired, to show the viewer how these weapons have strengths and weakness' against one another.  Some of the all time greatest hand to hand fighting as well.",1286236800,49,932,4.494047619047619
1666339,5,B00005UQ78,"This is one of my favorite kung fu fic's of all time.  The final fight scene is one of my top five finishing moves of all time, next to North Shaolin vs South Shaolin.  The movie starts off a little slow only to set you up for two different but simular fight scenes. The female lead is just a bit silly but she plays the spoiled brat very well. The opening scene and the ending are in typical Asian style (a few light moments, surrounded by alot of conflict).  A mission turned love story to tragity, ending with a twist. This is a classic you or any body would want to add to their Kung fu collection.",1177459200,,602,4.128205128205129
1666340,5,B00005UQ78,"""Shaolin Mantis"" remains one of my top 10 best kung fu flicks of all time.  This was my first exposure to the mantis fist, and to me it's still very impressive even now.  David Chiang performed stallerly, his overall demeanor in this movie was simply top notch!! I would recommend this flick to any old school kung fu lovers out there,,this is  one which you'll not walk away dissapointed!! The only draw back is the picture quality,,,almost every copy I've come across is really poor// however, still did not take anything away from this amazing flick!!",1150934400,2,554,4.75

7954983,4,B00005UQ78,"This movie is dubbed in English with well choreographed kung-fu fight scenes.  To understand this movie, you must understand the history of the Shaolin Temple, which is not explained any where in this movie except a comment made by the father (a Lord) of the main character (played by David Chiang).  If you haven't watched other Shaolin movies, you probably won't understand the point that the father was making at the end.  The period in this movie is during the transition from the Ming to the Qing Dynasties.  The Qing Dynasty are from the north and they invaded the Ming in the south and won.  So, China was ruled by the Qing at this point of the movie.  The Qing does not like the Shaolin Temples that were spread across China and was once well respected by the Ming Dynasty.  The newly Qing, suspecting that the Shaolin Temples were organizing rebellious plans against the Qing to bring back the Ming, they often sent spies into the temples.  Suspecting that the Qing Emperor was sending spies, the Shaolin temples often made it extremely difficult for new comers to enter into the organization.  Some Shaolin graduates or supporters did not live in Shaolin temples and were part of wealthy families/clans.

In this movie, the Qing emperor identified one of his lords' son (Wai Fung played by David Chiang) to be well groomed to be a spy as he is highly skilled in kung-fu that he should be able to get into one of the main Shaolin clans to spy and find out what they plan to do to rebel against the Qing Dynasty.  This particular clan has a daughter who is home-schooled by teachers brought in from outside the family.  Wai Fung, spy for the emperor, infiltrates as a teacher.  The father of the clan suspecting that the emperor might send spies orders that the new comer be killed to prevent him from leaving and reporting back to the emperor.  The daughter falls in love with this teacher and decides to save his life by telling her father that she had an affair with her teacher, is pregnant, and wants to marry him.  The father agreed on the condition that he never leaves the mansion.  If he tries to leave, he would be killed. Of course Wai Fung wants to leave in order to report back to the emperor what he learns of the Shaolin clan and to save his father, who was threatened by the emperor to be be-headed if the son doesn't report back within a year.  To defeat his wife's father, he had to learn the Mantis kung-fu.  Upon returning, his own father reveals that he's not a supporter of the Qing Dynasty and he, himself, wants to see the return of the Ming Dynasty because the Qing Dynasty is bad for the country and should not be the ruler of China.  He is not happy that his son helped the Qing, which confused the heck out of his son being that his father served as a lord to the new Qing.  Go watch the movie being that you now have context of what's going on in this historic period.  FYI, the Qing Dynasty nearly wiped out the Shaolin temples as many of them were burnt to the ground historically (not in this movie).",1497830400,,3040,4.441441441441442
7954984,1,B00005UQ78,"Don't know why I bothered to write a review- probably because it was so over rated that I felt cheated. People watch this for a story like me, just give up. There isn't one. Who kills family members for escaping a clan? Really?. Sound effects are endless and just stupid.",1495929600,,271,4.44

7954986,3,B00005UQ78,"The fight scenes were well choreographed and were pleasant to watch.

The story was not well written, with abrupt time cuts and patchy transitions. The night chase scene was horribly done. The ending came out of nowhere and was not very believable. I don't really judge the typical Shaw Brothers films for character development or acting.

The movie poster is totally deceiving as Gordon Liu only plays a small part in the first 5 minutes.",1494720000,,439,4.84
