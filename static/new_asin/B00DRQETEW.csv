5851507,4,B00DRQETEW,"RLJ and Image Entertainment are quickly gaining a reputation for releasing some interesting independent films in both the horror and sci-fi genres. I'm not saying that you can just pick up anything they put out. Still, the quality of their projects keep getting stronger and stronger both in story content and recognizable talent appearing in their films.

Just as I say this, their latest horror offering ""All Hallows' Eve"" doesn't have any recognizable stars in it. However, this works in the movie's favor. It roots you in the film and keeps you from tethering yourself in reality through the sight of familiar faces like Christian Bale or Sarah Michelle Gellar.

Sarah (Katie Maguire) spends Halloween babysitting her friend's son(Cole Mathewson) and daughter (Sydney Freihofer). After an evening of trick 'r treating, the three settle down in front of a scary movie to empty out the children's' goodie bags. Timmy finds an old VHS tape in his stash and quickly talks Sarah into letting them watch it. They soon find themselves immersed in an anthology of disturbing short films that fit the chilling holiday they're celebrating. Thank goodness they're only make-believe or are they?

""All Hallows' Eve"" is definitely a treat for the Halloween season. It's an interesting blend of intertwining tales in the spirit of ""Creepshow"" and ""Tales from the Crypt"" with an evil clown that would rival Pennywise from Stephen King's ""It."" Art, the evil clown, is the constant throughout these macabre stories.

Director/Writer Damien Leone knew what he was doing when having musicians Noir Deco handle the score for ""All Hallows' Eve."" They drum up memories of the electronic soundtracks for John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch."" I can only imagine this was intentional. It definitely adds to the creepiness and atmosphere of the film.

""All Hallows' Eve"" is light on bonus material. The only special feature included on the DVD is audio commentary provided by Writer/Director Damien Leone and actor Mike Giannelli. Giannelli plays Art the Clown in the movie and quite possibly might not ever get another job because of it.

Although it's not rated, I would give ""All Hallows' Eve"" an ""R."" It has a lot of graphic violence and gore. There's also adult language and situations. I was a bit disappointed in the full frontal nudity in the last segment. Before that, there was no nudity at all. I think Leone could've gotten his point across without it. I know it doesn't seem like that big of a deal to some people in a movie that has so much blood and violence. However, to some viewers it's a deal-breaker that causes them from recommending the film to others.

""All Hallows' Eve"" is perfect for an adult night of horror festivities. The stories range from old-fashioned ""Rosemary's Baby""-type thrills to sci-fi schlock and slasher scares. Each segment is seen as a film within a film, so there's added dirt and scratches to the picture to give it grindhouse and classic flavors. Let me also add that if you weren't already scared of clowns before now, you will be after watching this.",1382140800,5,3110,4.969230769230769
5851508,1,B00DRQETEW,It's sad that this group of scammers came together and added some footage to a YouTube short film and then released it to unsuspecting collectors. Don't fall for this money grab! There are many titles available that your hard earned dollars will be better spent on.,1380412800,4,265,4.782608695652174
5851509,4,B00DRQETEW,"All Hallows Eve sprung from a short film that proved quite popular on Youtube, Terrifier. A psychotic clown figure who is harassing a woman and killing those around her. My understanding it was created to raise interest and fund for All Hallows Eve.

With All Hallows Eve we have an anthology of three stories joined together by what this woman views on a video while baby sitting. Terrifier is one of those short stories.

From going by the trailer this look very promising and look forwards to checking it out.",1379289600,6,512,4.677777777777778

5851516,1,B00DRQETEW,"Nonsensical plot that literally ONLY happens because every single character in the movie lacks basic common sense. Immortal antagonist, so you know exactly how it will end. The storyline is extremely inconsistent. You can tell that everything was just sloppily thrown together. This was a last ditch effort by a has-been ""director"" to make something out of his numerous other failed attempts at movies. Would rate 0 stars if possible.",1497312000,,434,5.214285714285714

Hateful main characters who are shoddily acted and written even more shoddily, and a ""plot"" full of tired old devices that really don't make much sense.

5851532,2,B00DRQETEW,I believe that only the third story with the character of Art the clown made it entertaining.. sadly it took 2 other boring stories before you watched the third. Maybe Art the clown should have been in all three...,1484006400,,214,4.512820512820513
5851533,5,B00DRQETEW,This was such a great horror film.  The acting was amazing! The three actors that played the babysitter and the two children were incredible!  The three stories intertwined was a great twist. Although the second story with the Alien theme I hated.  Sorry.  But the first and third story made the movie for me.  The the babysitter Sara and Tia and Timmy's scenes were sooooooo great! I loved Art the clown in a sick way too. LOL He had me at honk!,1481241600,,446,4.390243902439025

5851536,4,B00DRQETEW,"finally a scary horror movie on a low budget. Awesome. It is a wonderful little anthology that takes us on a little journey through the bad, very bad no very very bad days of a few lost souls. Just like the ones of old except we have no classic actors like back in the day to start and rap them up like, Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, Basil Rathbone, Peter Lorre,  Christopher Lee or even Peter Cushing. No those days, sadly have pasted. Now those that have tried to follow don't have the class or charisma of the greats.  That is a good reason why horror remakes tend to fall down compared to their very old originals.",1479168000,3,618,4.318965517241379

It just ended up being lame, and the transitions between the people in the movie, and the movie they are watching, was awkward. The movie within the movie thing was a good premise, but executed poorly. I actually forgot a couple of times that there were supposed to be people watching these scenes I was watching, as if it were a movie.

The trailer was infinitely better than the movie. Just watch the trailer, and you're good.",1473465600,,567,4.4

5851554,4,B00DRQETEW,"First movie to actually freak me out a little bit in awhile. The makeup and villain are good, but the sound/music and acting are horrible (save for the clown). I think some of the side characters' bad acting was intended, though. To add a comedic twist to everything.

If you like Trick R' Treat, the ""Freakshow"" movies, or other sorts of movies with various ""Stories"" written in, you'll love this one. Or even if you like watching movies with horrible actors (to laugh at them, of course).",1462924800,,490,4.632183908045977

5851558,4,B00DRQETEW,Agree with what everyone else was posting on IMDB about the alien story. The first story and the third story were great. And the overarching story about the babysitter and kids that find the vhs tape was also quite enjoyable. Woulda been 5 stars if not for that alien story. The alien story wasn't horrible but it just didn't fit in very well. Art the (demonic? psychotic for sure) Clown was creepy as hell. Great raw horror.,1457913600,2,425,4.532467532467533

5851567,1,B00DRQETEW,I watched the original one twice without knowing it and I must say that with the time that they put into it its not worth the money that you would pay to rent or buy it.  Its a okay movie if you find it for 2 dollars but not for the current amount as it is short and the plot is jumpy all over the place not holding on to one area at a time.,1450310400,,341,3.546666666666667

5851570,4,B00DRQETEW,"I have watched this movie for the past two Halloweens, because I like it enough that it is a good movie for that time of year. This movie is basically one overarching background tale, Young boy and girl being babysat, find a VHS tape in his treat bag. Tape contains several strange, basically independent short horror films, which contain the main antagonist on the front of the movie.
The first film is ok, but the subsequent ones are pretty damn creepy, and the totality of the story is tied together in a pretty original way. Now this isn't horror gold, but it is a solid film, which will creep you out, and gross you out in some spots, while still being solidly enough wrote and put together that it is worth the time to watch.

5851581,4,B00DRQETEW,"Lets face it  clowns are just about the creepiest things to be found on this earth.  No normal adult would ever smear makeup all over his face, dress up in some ridiculous outfit that even Liberace wouldnt wear, and go out in public.  And they're mimes, which makes them pure evil in my book.  That silent laughter bit isn't funny, and that whole bucket-throwing shtick was old about a hundred years ago.  I say we wait until these freakish buffoons are all crammed together in their little cars and wipe them out.  Why am I ranting about clowns?  Well, obviously, All Hallows Eve features a killer clown, one who has gone even farther down the path of evil than John Wayne Gacy.

It all starts with a videotape, which little Timmy discovers when he dumps out his bag of Halloween candy on the table.  Now, when I was a kid, I watched what people put in my bag, wanting to know who was giving me fruit instead of the good stuff, but Timmy has no idea where the tape came from.  Unfortunately, babysitter Sarah (Katie Maguire) gives in to Timmys and his sisters demand to watch the thing.  It appears to be some kind of unnamed horror anthology featuring a sinister clown doing unnamable things to people.  Its just the kind of thing to get under the skin of horror novices like Sarah and the kids.  After the first of the films three stories, Sarah finally shuffles the kids off to bed, but she continues to watch in an effort to convince herself that what seems increasingly real is not in fact real at all.  That, of course, is a big mistake.

The middle of the three anthology stories is pretty darn weird and barely features the clown, but the first and third are pretty good examples of your typical slasher fare.  Two of them look like drive-inn shlock from the 1970s, so I was surprised to learn that all three scenes came from recent other films made by director Damien Leone.  They do have that old-school look and feel to them, though, and thats a plus in my book.

All Hallows Eve doesnt deliver any surprises, but I enjoyed it.  The director wasn't shy about using blood and gore, and Mike Giannelli puts in a memorable performance as Art the Clown.  Hes even more sick, twisted, and evil than your average killer clown, and that makes All Hallows Eve eminently worthy of a spot in your Halloween week horror movie rotation.",1445817600,3,2336,4.490521327014218

Are you a horror freak? Do you watch horror movies almost compulsively? If yes, I am talking to you. As you also do, I'm sure, I continuously scour for movies that I haven't yet seen and very few of them are actually very satisfying. All Hallow's Eve is one of those rare surprises. I loved the look of the clown, which is an accomplishment as I usually don't find movie clowns actually disturbing. This one was. His menace was apparent. The 3 vignettes were A,B,A+++ and the wrap around was perfect and could easily be its own movie. The production was very good. This filmmaker definitely has a vision and a gift for delivering it.

5851622,2,B00DRQETEW,"Whoever made the trailer for this thing deserves an award. I mean, I'm an experienced enough movie goer at this point not to be suckered so easily by a well-edited commercial for a film, but I admit: this movie's trailer got my hopes way up.

Apparently it was created based on the success of a few internet clips of the clown that features prominently in the film. That's fair enough. It's a creepily done clown in most ways. The film itself: not so much.

First of all, it's an anthology film. No points lost for that. These appear to be gaining popularity. Although it means the films often lack cohesion, it also gives it multiple chances to win audiences over.

The over-arching story here is about a baby-sitter with the personality of a toothbrush taking care of two abrasively over-acted kids on Halloween night, all of them so meticulously make-upped and lit that it's impossible not to imagine the rest of the crew standing mere feet away (made even easier by the fact that there's virtually no establishing shots, with everyone in close-up). One of the kids, an alarmingly skinny boy, receives a blank videotape in his bag of Halloween candy, and they all sit down to watch it. Lucky for us, this family still owns a VCR, because the video contains our three scary stories.

STORY #1 - CREEPY TRAIN STATION IS CREEPY
A young woman has a close encounter with the film's scary clown villain while waiting for a train at a station that more closely resembles an elementary school boiler room. There are a few creepy scenes and moments in this one, and the actors really give it their all. The story, however, degenerates into random nonsense  and monster make-up that is a fang or two shy of really selling itself. It also includes a bad guy who keeps awkwardly licking his lips, like chapped skin is scary.

STORY #2 - WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD!
A young woman is unpacking boxes in her new home. Great pains are taken to illustrate how isolated the location is. Nothing happens for about ten minutes, although the electricity does go out and the women gets scared by bright lights from outside. Then she discovers the alien. Or rather, the skinny guy in the easily damaged alien costume. Cue screaming and running and absolutely nothing else.

STORY #3 - THE GASH STATION
In the goriest of the three clips, a young woman (must it always be young women?) encounters our clown friend at a gas station, where he begins terrorizing her because he's evil or something. This section of the film is shot in a gritty, sepia-ish tone that makes it feel more engaging, and the effects are the strongest of the movie. There's more of an attempt at a story -- although not much -- but the ending is so desperate to be shocking that it comes across as almost laughable.

I'm going to let you guess how the movie ends, although I recommend not being too imaginative with your guesses. All in all, it's not the worst horror film I've ever seen, but it does seem to think that a creepy bad guy and some intermittent gore are good substitutes for plot and character, leaving the whole thing pretty hollow.",1391990400,24,3099,4.611615245009075
5851623,1,B00DRQETEW,"Theres nothing like a good Halloween film and unfortunately All Hallows Eve is nothing like a good Halloween film.  The movie liberally borrows parts of its plot from Halloween and Trick R Treat, two vastly superior films.  A Babysitter (who looks much older than the character she is playing) is babysitting for two kids on Halloween night.  Now why is it that ONLY in the movies do kids carve their Jack-o-lanterns on Halloween night AFTER they have returned from trick-or-treating?  Whats the point?  Ive carved a field full of pumpkins in my life and always before Halloween night.  Anyhow, Timmy dumps out his candy sack to find that someone stuck a VHS tape in his bag.  The tape is unmarked and both Timmy and sister Tia want to watch the tape but babysitter Sarah refusesuntil the kids pester the hell out of her.

The tape features 3 different stories each hosted by a silent but horrifying clown.  The first involves women who are abducted aboard a train and taken captive in the tunnels by a group of cultist cannibals.  The second story involves a woman who is terrorized in her new home by an alien.  The third film involves a woman with car trouble who arrives at a gas station to find our clown cutting up the attendant.

The three films are mind-boggling horrendous.  They are filmed with a grainy sketchy quality to try and give it a grindhouse appeal but it simply comes off looking cheap and amateurish.  Theres no rhyme or reason to any of the stories.  The alien in the second story looks like it was created using a dollar store mask.  The only mildly intriguing part is the wraparound story of the babysitter who discovers that watching the tape has brought the clown into the real worldlike that wasn't predictable.

All Hallows Eve is gory but its cheesy, low-budget laughable gore.  Coupled with weak performances on every level All Hallows Eve is a cruel trick for Halloween film fans.",1390608000,7,1912,4.6906906906906904
5851624,4,B00DRQETEW,"Firstly, you need to understand that this is not a big budget film with great acting and writing. It has some flaws as mentioned in some of the other reviews. Some of the dialogue seems unnatural and forced at times. Not all of the three short stories deliver a big punch.

In spite of its flaws, this film has a lot going for it to make worth watching.  It has one of the creepiest clowns I have ever seen.  Clowns scare me anyway, but this one goes way over the top on the creepy meter.  The grainy filming washed out colors and glaring light reminded me of the old slash and gore horror flicks I watched at the theater as a kid.real grind house stuff.
Yes, some of the plot is overused, the babysitter on Halloween night, but I saw that as more of a homage to the early slasher films as opposed to a lack of imagination. It is pretty obvious that some of the scenes of the babysitter and children are very much inspired and are a takeoff of Halloween.
I wouldnt recommend spending a lot o money to own this movie, but I would definitely recommend renting it or purchasing if the price is under 10$",1389571200,,1100,4.248803827751196

I jumped and cringed MANY times.  Some of the blood and gore was over the top for me, but overall I was glad I watched this movie.

5851634,5,B00DRQETEW,"I am a senior and have been watching sci-fi and horror films for many many many years.  I absolutely love All Hallows Eve,  Art the Clown happens to be very very scarey. The scenes in the train depot are chilling,  I consider a good horror film to be one which causes me to have goose bumps and indeed this film did that for me.  The scenes  where the adult baby sitter is watching the DVD that the young boy received instead of candy was fantastic the woman who played the part was amazing.  Watching her face added to the horror of what was going to happen.  Art chasing the young lady in the car was perfect, leading the watcher to know there would be more scarey scenes to come and even more evil. Well to finish Art the Clown could never be the spoke person for a fast food restaurant - because he is absolutely evil and scarey looking. Oh I forgot,  I thought the Alien scenes were done very well - and this part of the film was very scarey not knowing were the sounds were coming from, and when the picture was unveiled and it was Art the Clown all I can say is,  Perfect.  Well these are my thoughts if you disagree with my thoughts - I am sorry you didn't Enjoy the film to its fullest.",1383436800,,1195,4.156521739130435
5851635,3,B00DRQETEW,The concept for the movie is pretty neat. The first 2 little shorts I didn't find to be all that great. The 3rd one and the end of the wraparound story were pretty good. The acting isn't too bad but it gets corny at moments like in the 2nd short where the alien walks around waving his arms about like he's performing in a ballet. All in all the film isn't too bad. It's a pretty fun halloween anthology to watch.,1383264000,3,413,4.111111111111111

at times - I say you'll enjoy it. Do yourself a favor, unlike others,
don't go into this thing with high expectations. It is supposed to make
you cringe, be creeped out, and laugh all at the same time. It is not
supposed to be taken seriously.

For an independent low-budget horror film, it did a solid job. Did I

5851637,3,B00DRQETEW,So I watched the trailer for this and it made this movie look amazing from I but it is far from it. Now it's not a horrible movie but just not that great either. This so called anthology movie has really only one really good short and that's the last one. The first was ok and the second was pretty bad and didn't really fit. The whole movie was a nice little surprise with all the other horror movie crap floating out there and i would recommend a watch but I blind bought it off of the trailer and I'm not upset with my purchase just let down. Overall was ok and by no means is it a new Halloween staple. Not even close. I call this horror movie junk food.

5851638,3,B00DRQETEW,"Caught this on PPV and was really surprised.  No, it's not anything great, the effects are uber-bad, the acting leaves a bit to be desired, plot/smot, but, I STILL had a good time!  Seems a gal is babysitting on Halloween (*nudge, nudge; wink; wink*) and while the kiddies open their goodie sacks, one finds an old VHS Tape, so naturally they decide to watch it.  The viewer is then ""treated"" to three separate stories all involving the maniacal clown (who is also creepy).  Soon--and much to no one's suprise--clownie-face seems to be coming to life right before babysitter's eyes.  I believe this is UR for gore and nudity.  Nothing that will make you keep the lights on, but it's still better than most of these schlock things I've seen.",1383091200,,740,4.6976744186046515
5851639,2,B00DRQETEW,"I was pretty excited to see this one. The trailer looked amazing. Unfortunately, I finished it feeling underwhelmed and slightly disappointed. I had never seen any of the shorts on youtube before, so this was all new to me. Out of the 3 short films in this, I really only enjoyed the last one. The others are overly simplistic and predictable. The frame story that showcases the other three is decent, but not at all original. One of the stories in the collection does not even take place on Halloween, and features someone so obviously in an Alien suit it comes off comical. I'll watch it again, but I don't think this movie is going to catch on as a Halloween staple. Not at all. I wouldn't write off the director, hopefully he can churn out a few more films as fun and creepy as ""Terrifier"". I wanted to like this as much as anyone, but the fact is...it's just not that good. I think it's worth a rental (some people really seem to like it, though i find some of the enthusiasm suspicious...i've seen the movie.)

5851640,4,B00DRQETEW,"( All Hallows Eve) is a perfect example of old school horror/slasher done right. I love the grainy look of it and the score was creepy and on point as well. This is a film that is somewhat made up of three short stories but in actuality it`s one entity that blends perfectly together to make a shockingly gruesome film.

Of course most hard core slasher fans are familiar with the short film (Terrifier) which is featured in this film and seeing as the main focus is on the maniacal killer clown (Art) we already know this film has guts""literally"".

The story focuses on a woman babysitting two children on Halloween night.""a familiar but seductive formula to horror fans"".One of the children receives a strange VHS tape in his candy bag and when it is played the Terror begins.

The gore effects were pretty amazing for a low budget film, they were gruesome and no holds barred. This film contains the things nightmares are made of. Art the clown will be hard to forget. This ones going in my collection for sure.",1383004800,,1014,4.56043956043956

8596825,4,B00DRQETEW,"Bought this dvd without having seen it before and I was pleasantly surprised! Art the clown is terrifying. Loved the concept of this film because I had never seen anything like it. Also, the gore in this movie is amazing and actually looks realistic. Some of the acting is a bit cringe-y but tolerable. This is a great movie to watch around Halloween every year.",1527724800,,362,4.584615384615384
8596826,4,B00DRQETEW,"This is a really good micro budget horror movie. I really liked this movie and I thought that it was pretty creative, it kept me guessing. Many movies let a small budget handicap a movie, however with this film it gives it a very retro grindhouse feel to it. The gore in this movie can be a bit excessive and shocking at times, but its really well done for the budget. If your a fan of horror movies, especially ones from the 80s, give this a shot.",1525824000,,448,4.160919540229885
8596827,3,B00DRQETEW,"This isn't perfect but its super fun, nasty, and low budget. I watched this right after I watched ""Terrifier"" to see more of Art the clown/mime. Some stories are stronger than others, but for a low budget horror anthology, I found it pretty enjoyable.",1524873600,,251,4.7272727272727275
8596828,2,B00DRQETEW,"This one was recommended to me by a few fellow horror fans. I was also warned against it by other horror fans. So the field was mixed, and I figured I needed to have a look for myself, what with Terrifier either out now or coming very soon. While it's pretty good for a low-budget horror flick, which these days is saying something, it's not memorable. While with better overall visual quality than many anthologies out there today, it was otherwise just kinda there. Two of the three vignettes were gory but boring. The one with the lady, the house, and the guests from way out of town was pretty decent, but the reveal connecting it to the other two and the wraparound arc was out of place and really forced, as if they dragged in a story from someplace else they had to make fit somehow. The ending segment was the most interesting and creepy part of the entire film but could have done with ending right when she got to the top of the stairs. Stylistically, it's got solid direction, and the same goes for the visuals. The cast do well, and Art's physical expressionism is on-point, but there's no solid underpinning. There's just not enough of a story anywhere in there to evoke anything in me as a viewer other than I figure these guys and gals had fun making an 70s-or-80s-homage horror film, and that's not enough.",1522713600,,1322,4.4896265560165975
