8205281,4,B000SGHSV0,This is a nicely done DVD with an interesting segment on history and some well done segments spotlighting some of the most interesting places on the island. Photography and production are very professional. This one is definately worth the price for anyone interested in taking a trip to the Big Island.,1270598400,8,303,4.96078431372549
