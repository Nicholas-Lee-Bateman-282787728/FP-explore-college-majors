8221509,4,6304935838,"It's unfair to compare this epic 1960's recreation of the D-Day landings with the latter retelling of ""Saving Private Ryan"". In this film, we see the battle from many angles - from Generals to grunts, airborne troops to those who came in on the beach in the amhibious LST's, fighter pilots to tankers, civilians to fighters - as opposed to ""Ryan's"" story focused on a single anonymous unit. Here, an all-star cast fights the war on many fronts. It's early summer in Europe - the weather is horrible, but all sides think an allied landing on Europe's Atlantic coast is certain. At zero hour, allied troops pore onto the Normandy beaches, hoping they can seize the beach faster than coastal Wehrmacht units can machine-gun them. Airborne units move silently through the French countryside hoping they can take strategic spots and link up with the amhibious force on the coast. German units plead desperately for reinforcements while their superiors remain mute: whether convinced that the Normandy landings are a decoy for a real attack on Calais or simply because they haven't got the nerve to wake the Fuhrer from his nap. Chaos reigns on the beach, but something keeps the force cohesive - when units are destroyed, individual troops link up and form new ones. There is little gore, but that wouldn't work on a level as broad as this. In one extended shot, the camera follows a unit of Free-French troops trying to seize an occupied town. The charge of the anonymous troops - with the French casulaties simply dropping dead - looks more like something out of real-time strategy game like ""Command and Conquer"" than a war movie, but we know that such scenes were common, and that people did dies faceless, typical and unspectacular deaths. Death in war was gruesome and gory, but the compulsion to base the narrative on gore is pure Hollywood - among other things, it allows todays studios to pat themselves on the back for being more realistic, as well as showing off better special effects. In many ways, ""Day"" is more modern than ""Ryan"" because it relies on less heroism than ""Ryan"" does, and offers more irony in its place. While ""Ryan"" served up plenty of sentiment for the greatest generation, ""Day"" had John Wayne on the verge of tears (when entering a French town and first seeing scores of machine-gunned paratroops hanging by their chutes from the tops of buildings) and Richard Burton appropriately stoic as a downed Spitfire pilot with a shattered leg, cynically dismissing war as being fought by men lost with their guns. Just because ""Day"" doesn't give the ""greatest generation"" the Hollywood treatment doesn't mean it's any less a tribute than ""Ryan"", only one with a strategy of its own.",999129600,6,2703,4.852813852813853
8221510,5,6304935838,"""The Longest Day"" is one of the greatest war films of all time, and one of my personal favorites!  Produced and directed by Darryl F. Zanuck, it was originally made to save the Twentieth Century-Fox studio from the financial ravages of the over-budget ""Cleopatra,"" which was being shot at the same time. ""The Longest Day"" set a standard of excellence in war films that is unsurpassed even now, thirty-eight years after its theatrical release.  It remains one of the most popular and successful war movies of all time.

This is the story of D-Day, June 6, 1944. Based on Cornelius Ryan's book of the same name, the film accurately chronicles the strategy, tactics, frustrations, triumphs, and failures of both the Allied and German sides on the day that marked the turning point of World War II in Europe. There are excellent performances all around by a star-studded international cast headed by John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, (a young) Sean Connery, Robert Ryan, and Eddie Albert. Occasional snippets of silliness rear their head throughout the movie, but are not distracting.  Filmed in black-and-white, ""The Longest Day"" has a documentary flavor and a wonderfully authentic feel that made it a film to view and savor time and time again. Highly recommended.",970444800,7,1273,5.0476190476190474
8221511,5,6304935838,"I first saw TLD in Paris, when it was released in Europe in 1963. Although the movie was made less than 20 years after the events it depicted took place, for many people in the audience this was the first visual depiction  of this specific day. Until then, an oral history of the  ""debarquement"" was what most French men and women had been  exposed to, and, like most other members of the audience, I will never  forget the German bunker scene when the early morning fog finally lifts to  reveal the allied invasion force. It seemed like the entire movie theater  had held its collective breath only to release it when the naval guns came  alive. The power of the movie, for me, resided in its myriad of small, true  vignettes which eventually help paint the larger picture and its ability to  seamlessly switch between sides and ranks; from the agonizing hours before  the final green light was given, betting the invasion on the accuracy of  the weather forecast to the doomed and useless strafing sortie of the two  German fighter planes. In conclusion, by today's standards, the acting  might have been sometimes crude, the special effects not realistic enough,  but the tone was never jingoistic or overly simplistic.  The movie managed  to convey quite effectively the message that D-Day's ultimate success was  due to a combination of blind luck, careful planning, tangled execution and  countless individual acts of valor and selflessness. That afternoon, in a  dark Champs Elysees movie theater, all of it came to life; and for that I  am grateful to Mr. Zanuck and company...",930009600,2,1585,4.843283582089552
