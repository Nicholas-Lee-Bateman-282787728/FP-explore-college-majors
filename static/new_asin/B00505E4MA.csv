4511510,3,B00505E4MA,"""Where The Boys Are '84"" is more or less the female version of 1983's ""Spring Break"" rather than an update of the 1960 Paula Prentiss/Connie Francis original. It's your standard college-kids-on-vacation flick, mid-80s style with lots of frizzy hair and cheesy music. The sex and profanity is somewhat tame by today's standards. Lisa Hartman is the diligent, responsible music student; Lorna Luft's the zany one who's bored with her longtime boyfriend; Wendy Schaal is the prissy Southern belle and Lynn-Holly Johnson's the party chick in search of meaningless sex with a ""Conan the Barbarian""-type.

Not a great film by any means--Lorna Luft brings the most to the table as the comic relief and her dance routine during a ""Hot-Bod"" contest is quite amusing, but not enough to save the movie. It's predictable and there's not a lot of snappy dialogue. Lisa Hartman fans may be disappointed. Though she performs the title song at the end, she doesn't show a lot of skin here, which is odd because I've seen pics of her from this era and she always looked great in a bikini.

Where this release succeeds is in the bonus features. There's a 20-minute interview with Russell Todd but fans of Wendy Schaal will be delighted. Hers runs over a half-hour and she elaborates on everything and even talks about her time on ""It's a Living"" and ""Fantasy Island"". She still looks adorable by the way (*NOTE* Check out the screen grabs I posted in the Images section of this product).

Rent before you buy. Not a keeper, unless you're a big fan of Wendy; then get it for the extensive interview. The print looks great and it's widescreen.",1318723200,17,1623,4.789285714285715
4511511,5,B00505E4MA,my copy was used and skips and freezes. Hope it clears up since VHS tape version is hard to find. But wanted it really bad. Know the movie by heart and can remember skipped scenes. Best remake of Connie Francis version in 60's.,1316908800,,227,4.3023255813953485

4511515,4,B00505E4MA,"If you're into Spring Break flicks about Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. in the 1980's you'll probably enjoy this silly romp. These actors are all a little too ""over-the-hill"" to play college students! Keep an eye on Lorna Luft (she's Judy Garland's daughter & Liza Minelli's half sister) she spends a a lot of time mugging for the camera. She tries very hard to make you believe she's a college kid, but looks more like a 30-something housewife who belongs in a station wagon, not a convertible. An attempt to give her a younger appearance with pigtails (in a beach scene) only makes her look retarded, not youthful. Unintentional laughter will take hold of you when Luft's character, Carole Singer, enters a ""Hot Bod""(?!) contest... AND WINS SECOND PLACE!!! The soundtrack is good, with the standout tunes ""Seven Day Heaven"" by Shandi, & Lisa Hartman's remake of the Connie Francis classic ""Where The Boys Are.""
(I agree with the other reviewers that if you have a soft spot in your heart for the 80's, spring break, & South Florida you'll be loving this!)",1192320000,5,1047,4.790055248618785
4511516,5,B00505E4MA,i think this movie need to be put on dvd it is a good movie,1159315200,4,59,3.0
4511517,3,B00505E4MA,"Not nearly as substantial as the original.  This film has little more to offer than a mindless romp in the Florida sun in the early 1980's.

Here I go again.  I am prejudiced.  I am both a Florida fiend and hopelessly nostalgic for the 1980's.  That's all there is in this movie.  It is otherwise totally forgettable.  Nevertheless, it is fun.  Not every movie tries or even should be a literary work of art.

Fort Lauderdale of 1983, a few years before I got there for the first time myself! I can watch this movie over and over.  It is another time capsule I love to open.  There is the music, lots of early 80's rockabilly and synthesizer pop;  the beautiful Fort Lauderdale locations, lots more than the original movie;  and, of course, the boys!  Oh, how I want the 80's back again!  If you don't, then don't bother with this movie.  Otherwise, just turn it on and enjoy a trip down memory lane, with a beachfront view.",1148774400,10,924,4.410714285714286

4511519,3,B00505E4MA,"Like the original film was a time capsule of the 1960s, this remake is without question a product of its time. However, the main difference between the original and the remake was that the former made some attempt to address youth issues of the day in a forthright manner. This remake is all cheap 80s silliness from start to finish, and doesn't make any effort to ""say"" anything of substance. However, that doesn't mean that it isn't without merits. Though it's nothing particularly special, Where the Boys Are is a fun diversion for anyone who appreciates B-grade 80s teen films (like Secret Admirer or Hard Bodies, for example). It goes exactly where you think it will, but if the premise appeals to you, you'll likely enjoy it.",1470614400,3,731,4.7637795275590555

4511522,5,B00505E4MA,I loved this movie when I was a teenager (even though there were some inappropriate parts for a young girl to see - I was oblivious to it then).  I mainly loved this movie because of the romance between Lisa Hartman-Black and Russell Todd (and I was a big Lisa Hartman fan).  Good fun movie and I still enjoy watching it today and I love hearing Lisa sing the title song.  I never saw the original one that was made in the 60's so I can't compare it but I really enjoyed this one.  I would not recommend this to anyone under the age of 16 because of some of the content (although it's mild compared to the shows/movies of today).,1437609600,2,629,4.1735537190082646
4511523,3,B00505E4MA,Not as good as the original.  A little too silly for me but not bad entertainment for a Sunday afternoon when there is nothing else to watch.,1430870400,,141,4.222222222222222

4511531,5,B00505E4MA,"Quality isn't good and for the price it was not worth it... I liked this movie as a young man because Lisa Hartman was hot in this film. One bonus from watching it is it takes you back to how life really was in the early-mid 80's.

4511537,2,B00505E4MA,This was a small budget remake of the classic tale of four college girls on springbreak looking for excitement and romance and it shows. Unless your looking for an 80's period piece stick with the original.,1397520000,,206,4.75

4511542,5,B00505E4MA,"No one will ever confuse this with Citizen Kane, Dark Victory, or any other classic film.  But this stupid little film from the 1980s is a perfect time capsule of (an idealized) college existence before the Internet and before life became so complicated.  There is something almost sweet about this movie---R rated, but sweet.  I am not going to use the word wholesome, but this is just a slice of life that many collegians wish they could have had during their university experience.  Big thumbs up to Lisa Hartman and Lorna Luft.  I wish Lisa Hartman would have been able to sing more in this film.  She has a terrific voice.",1382400000,6,627,4.603603603603603
4511543,5,B00505E4MA,Love this epic 80's movie.  I would have to say it is even better than the ol' 60's classic.  Makes you want to pack up and go visit Ft. Lauderdale!,1379203200,,148,3.9
4511544,5,B00505E4MA,"If you are a fan of 1980s ""it's so bad, it's good"" cheese, then definitely get this movie!  I'm glad it's been released on DVD so I can include it in my other ""so bad it's good"" collection, such as The Pirate Movie, Spring Break and Flash Gordon....LOL",1375488000,,252,4.25
4511545,3,B00505E4MA,"When we saw this in org. theatrical release we considered it a Hard Bodies or Spring Break ripoff. For the most it holds its own, separately far as a typical 80's spring break type movie. However the gags, dialogue (script) and teenybop/adult humor are flat. Luft isn't bad in her role as subtle-sultry Carole, however the other three's characters are horribly typecast here.

The love-ending saga with Jenny (Hartman) and piano-guy is predictable, and the usual teen/college-sex romps are oft over the top. A few areas are funny, like the dance-off featuring Luft doing some silly ballet moves aren't bad.

Overall I give this one a C+ for effort. Again, not the greatest release nor the best script, but its cute.",1373846400,,715,4.900826446280992

4511549,4,B00505E4MA,"I like this product for I am able to relate to it , when I viewed it on Adelaide television  I searched for a copy of it in the video stores but with no luck.
Then in 1998 I was given a chance to visit the U.S.A.  florida  by the owner of the mansion where the pool party was held I lived in the house for four months and  travelling around seeing the various places and sites of florida and getting to know their family and friends and even travelling to the Bahamas  on their yacht the salty kangaroo the one you see cruising paste the rear of the mansion on the water way, I had a need to find a copy of the movie, after all I did clean the pool every day I was there.

4511552,4,B00505E4MA,"I just ordered this today and I'm so excited! I have been waiting for years for WTBA 84 to come out on dvd. This movie is pure camp, cheese. There are some great unintentional comedy moments.  The best thing is that the movie was filmed entirely in Fort Lauderdale in late 1983 for an April 1984 release date. Being a Fort Lauderdale resident, it is wonderful to have so much of the beach front at that time saved on film.  FTL beach looks nothing like the film today, all of the mom and pop motels are gone, replaced with high end resorts.  The Fort Lauderdale Beach Hotel where the girls stay was basically torn down except for the front facade and is now a luxury high rise hotel. The concert scene was film in Hollywood Florida and the outdoor theater is still there.  All of the girls have their moments except for Lisa Hartman who is not much of a comedic actress.  In my younger years my friends and I had many a road trip filled with similar experiences.  This is not a movie you watch for substance or mainstream comedy. This is for those of you (like me) with a twisted sense of humor and a fondness for the 1980's and all of its tacky glory. Plus the Hot Russell Todd (no actor but so pretty)shows us plenty of skin. I can't wait to see his interview (and Wendy's) on the dvd.  The best guilty pleasure!",1330992000,2,1314,4.295546558704453
