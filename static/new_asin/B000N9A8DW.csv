8175718,5,B000N9A8DW,"An unusual film with multiple eccentric endearing characters, a strong female lead who ties them all together,  and a couple villains who eventually reap the injustice they have sewn.  The story faces  life head-on, but includes enough whimsy to make it enjoyable, or at least  worth living, sometimes just bearable.  As the main character said, ""Life must be lived.""  I thought it was just perfect.",1512950400,,399,5.061538461538461

8175722,5,B000N9A8DW,"This movie is about four generations of women in a Dutch farming village in the mid-twentieth century but if that sounds boring, don't go away yet. It sounded boring to me, toomultigeneration sagas are not my thingbut I watched it because a friend wanted me to, and I loved it. Isolated from the political and technological changes of the outside world to an almost unbelievable degree, the movies rural setting frees it to concentrate on the basics of humanity: birth, sex/love/marriage, and death. It has an emotional rightness and depth that I remember experiencing in only a few other films (the movie Beasts of the Southern Wild and the television series Call the Midwife are examples that come to mind).

The movie is not anti-maleonly one of the men in it is really nastybut it certainly concentrates on women, chiefly Antonia and the three generations who follow her. They seem to see men as good companions and/or useful for making babies and running farm equipment, but not really essential. They certainly are strong enough to manage on their own, and with the help of one another. One gets an idea of the lines personality right at the beginning, when Antonia returns to the village in her thirties, with pubescent daughter Danielle (but no husband) in tow, to see to her dying mother: said mother, very ancient and far gone in dementia, is too busy railing profanely against Antonias father, dead for 30 years, to be willing to pass on just yet.

A few things seem a little improbable, including the villages complete lack of technology (tractors and a rickety bus to the city appear, but no one is ever shown driving a car or making a telephone call, let alone encountering a computer) and, conversely, its forward-looking apparent acceptance of Danielles husbandless pregnancy and later lesbian relationship. It also leaves a lot of questions unanswered, such as why Danielle and later, her daughter are inexorably drawn back to the village after living in the city for a while. However, these flaws, if flaws they are, are minor. The acting is superb, as is the makeup, which has to age some of the actors by 40 or 50 years over the course of the movie. Some of the subtitles, a merely workmanlike feature in most foreign movies, are positively poetic, especially when translating the voice-over narration that provides the story transitions.

After watching my friends DVD, I purchased for my own copy a version that had just been reissued in April 2016. The restoration in that version was excellent, with the color of the landscapes particularly vivid.",1461888000,2,2571,4.8922018348623855
8175723,5,B000N9A8DW,"I absolutely love this movie. The quality is admittedly poor, but that has to do with the underappreciated woman director and tiny budget so they didn't have great production materials but this is still such an amazing film. Witty and touching and I wish more people knew about it, I wish I could show it to everyone.",1460764800,,317,4.578947368421052
8175724,5,B000N9A8DW,"If you remember seeing this Belgian/Dutch film in its 1996 release you will certainly want to relive it on DVD or Bluray (I was only able to get the DVD version for review). If youve not seen it, and want a life changing experience, now is your chance, thanks to this terrific release from Film Movements new Classics series. I won't tell you much here in this review (so as not to spoil the discoveries you will make over this 104-minute film. And, though I have not read other reviews here yet, I urge you to see it without reading lengthy detailed reviews which provide the plot outline and, certainly not the ending. (If youve read my other reviews on amazon, you will know that I hate spoilers, and  especially in this case.)

Heres all you really need to know:
The film begins with a narrator telling us that the elderly Antonia (who we see on her bed, is going to die today. (THAT is not a spoiler, it is the opening scene!). We then immediately travel back to 1945 after World War II when a much younger Antonia returns to her childhood home after her mother dies. For the next 100 minutes we follow the next 50 years of Antonias life and family and friends she affects and is affected by.
The English subtitles are in high contract white and large enough to read easily

The film is rated R for scenes of nudity, sex and violence.

The photography is beautiful. The aging makeup (as well as the actors using their bodies to age with their roles is magnificent!
There is a nice bonus feature  an eight-minute interview (from 1996) with the writer/director  who was the first woman to win an Oscar (for a foreign film).

Film Movement went the extra step by including a 16-page color booklet with a nice five-page essay on the film (do NOT read it until after you have watched the film!), the cast list and some color photos.

I had forgotten this film over the years, but, since watching it again this week, I have not forgotten the images of the characters in this life affirming film.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
