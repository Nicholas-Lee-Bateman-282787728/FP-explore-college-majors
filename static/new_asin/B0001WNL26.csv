2033098,5,B0001WNL26,"As you can see from my reviews, I really like new, cutting edge, creative material.  So far I have been very lucky, I stumbled onto both the Animusic DVD, as well as the Gartel- Trance, Dance and Other Living Things DVD here on Amazon.  Both are cutting edge, and both are extremely entertaining.  If you only have two DVD's in your ""Media"" collection, I would strongly recommend both.  The Animusic is for all ages (new borns to adults), while the Gartel DVD is not for kids (probably because of its intense imagery).  If you can afford both, then I sincerely recommend you get both the Animusic, and the Gartel- Trance, Dance and other Living things.  If you need to make a choice between one or the other.  The entire family can watch and enjoy the Animusic.  Just like the Gartel DVD, the music supports the visuals on Animusic, instead of the visuals supporting the music.  I like this.",1097884800,3,891,4.5886075949367084
2033099,5,B0001WNL26,"Although you will quickly get bored with the music itself which isn't particularly great, the creativity behind this DVD is brilliant - the authors have shown world-class imagination in their creation of these virtual instruments and everyone should see this DVD at least once.

My particular favorite has to be Pipe Dream. Almost all of them look like the instruments could actually be created in real life.....Rube Goldberg, move over!!!",1097107200,3,439,5.271428571428571
2033100,5,B0001WNL26,"I ordered this DVD because I thought the animation looked really cool, and the tunes were pretty catchy and jazzy.  On a whim, I decided to put it on for my 4 month old baby, and he was instantly glued!  He was not just glued, he was also interactive with it... Smiling, giggling and becoming animated himself with the music.  He loves the whole DVD, but I can tell he especially loves the DRUM segment.  I totally recommend this video because on occasion it will buy you enough time to make and enjoy a quick dinner if you have a baby in the house ;-)

I'd rate it with 10 Stars if I could!",1093219200,,591,4.149122807017544

2033136,3,B0001WNL26,"The video is fine, however the cover it came in reeked with cigarette smoke to the point that I had to cleanse it several times, and leave it outside for over a week.  It still smells, but at least I can be in the same room with it.  I was planning on giving it as a gift, however, that is now out of the question.  I am clueless as to how they got that much smoke odor in such a small package.  That should have been noted on the sale site.",1455148800,,441,3.8131868131868134

2033160,2,B0001WNL26,I was disappointed with most of this video: too much emphasis on electric guitar sounds and drums. It grew tiresome very quickly. The bouncing ball section was better.,1428537600,,167,5.0

One simply can not feel blue, bad, angry, disassociated, or anything else, but aaahhhhhh, while watching either. It was so much fun watching the progress from 1 to 2 .

2033184,5,B0001WNL26,"After seeing a short snippet of one of the songs on this DVD, I immediately sought it out and bought it.

2033199,4,B0001WNL26,"What a good idea.  I know this has been out for quite a while, but I just bought a bigger tv and wanted to see the magnitude of color and sound it has.  Interesting video and fun to watch.",1388275200,,188,3.7948717948717947

2033201,5,B0001WNL26,"This movie is fabulous for kids and adults. I am an elementary music teacher - this is a great movie to leave with a sub. It keeps the kids engaged, it has really solid music, and the computer animation simply serves to highlight the music. The music isn't a ""side"", it's the main event in this video.",1387497600,,301,4.298245614035087
2033202,5,B0001WNL26,"This is one of my favorite dvds, I enjoy watching it for inspiration in my 3D animation projects. Highly recommended!",1384819200,,117,4.9
2033203,5,B0001WNL26,My son loves the animated instruments! It's neat to see a kid start a love for music through watching this.,1379203200,,107,4.4

2033216,5,B0001WNL26,This was my first purchase of Animusic and I've been a huge fan ever since. I'm like a little kid watching Pipe Dreams. It's like you stepped into a magical musical world populated my some no longer present mad scientist's world where he created self playing instrument machines. It's awesome!,1376179200,,293,4.88
2033217,3,B0001WNL26,"It was given as a gift so cannot realistically evaluate the product. However, I do find that it is much easier to shop on-line than at a department store.",1374969600,,154,4.344827586206897
2033218,5,B0001WNL26,"This movie is awesome.  It is basically computer generated shorts put to music.  They use midi driven animation.  Without too much detail this basically means that they can have a 1:1 for the music and action, rather than having  abstract animations like in Fantasia.  This is great for all of the scenes as objects like balls or drum sticks match the video perfectly.  Believe it or not this is not so easy to do.  If you go to the website they explain their process in more detail.

The music is original unlike in Fantasia.  This makes it more interesting in some ways because there are shorts from different genres of music and not just classical.

The only negative thing I can say is that the animation is not on par with pixar or other top studios.  It is really good though! Especially considering two guys making these shorts, not a whole team.  In any case my kids love this video and have watched it many many times.",1374278400,,927,4.485029940119761
2033219,5,B0001WNL26,"This animation is wonderfully imaginitive. I've repeatedly received excerpts from the disc, claiming the insruments are engineering marvels. The imagination of the artists is fantastic. I would recommend this DVD because it is entertaining
and thought provoking. The purchase was delivered promtly and as promised.",1368144000,,314,6.0
2033220,3,B0001WNL26,I saw a clip of this DVD on YouTube.  It was pretty amazing so I bought the DVD.  There are several tracks but really I only liked the one I'd seen on YouTube.  The other tracks are very good.  It's just that playing one track after another gets tedious quickly. I watched it through once and now I'll give the DVD to the library.,1367884800,2,330,4.109375
2033221,5,B0001WNL26,Don't skip on this one.  A very enjoyable DVD.  Very relaxing digital showing.  The computer work is outstanding and I highly recommend this first one.,1367798400,,151,4.96
2033222,5,B0001WNL26,"Anyone having an interest, should visit their website and see the demo's.  It sounds so good when the audio is played through a stereo system.  Perfect for ""In Home Theaters"".",1364428800,,175,4.8
2033223,5,B0001WNL26,This dvd features 7 short videos made from computer animation.  Even though it was made almost ten years ago it is still ahead of its time production-wise. The music covers various styles and genres of instrumental music and the songs range from frantically energetic to softer than most lullabies.  It is a great supplement to a music education curriculum.,1363651200,,357,5.033898305084746
2033224,3,B0001WNL26,"I first saw this as a ""fill in after the program"" late 1 evening on PBS . I bought (& enjoy occaisionally) out of ""curriosity"".",1361836800,,127,4.12
2033235,5,B0001WNL26,"infectious rhythm, catchy-enough melodies, and fascinating visuals..... for what more could you ask?  I read the reviews by others before I ordered this, after seeing several of the ""songs"" on my local PBS station over the past 6 months or so.... just had to have it, even if only for those songs.  My only complaint is that I can't hear the cymbals and high-hats.... maybe it's my 71-year old ears?  maybe it's the audio on my TV?  (haven't tried it playing the disc on my computer yet...) or, maybe it's the audio quality of the dvd.  At any rate, I'd welcome some feedback from others.  I can't wait to get the Animusic 2, too....",1361750400,,633,4.508771929824562

2033238,5,B0001WNL26,My grandson is mesmerised by this DVD. When I first watched it I was extremely impressed with the synchronisation of the music and the mechanical instruments and contraptions it depicts.,1360627200,,186,5.233333333333333
2033239,5,B0001WNL26,My two year old and four year old LOVE this movie!  It is so much fun to watch and they love to dance to it!,1358294400,,108,3.32
2033240,5,B0001WNL26,"It was what they said it was.  That's all one can ask with a branded product, I guess.  Happy with the purchase.",1357603200,,112,4.045454545454546
2033241,4,B0001WNL26,"i watched the second one first and was marginally dissapointed because it was not as good as the second production.  yet, it is still awesome to veiw",1357257600,,149,4.518518518518518
2033242,5,B0001WNL26,This DVD delighted me and my grandchildren ages 1 & 4. We especially liked Pipe Dreams. Well worth the money.,1347235200,,109,4.5

2033244,5,B0001WNL26,"Love this video!  Was a little disappointed the one clip I wanted is not in this video, but kids will love this and pay attention.  Great way to teach kids about music.",1327968000,,168,4.21875
2033265,5,B0001WNL26,This is a great kids video if you'd like to expose them to some excellent music and animation. Almost everyone is blown away by the production quality. I think you can get both videos for $30 on the animusic site.,1324598400,,213,4.35
2033266,5,B0001WNL26,Excellent dvd can be enjoyed by children and adults!!!! I hope soon they come out with animusic 3!! My grandchildren and friends really enjoy this dvd!!!,1317513600,,153,4.923076923076923
2033267,5,B0001WNL26,"I first saw this video on PBS as a special and I HAD to research him on the internet. I'm so freakin' jealous.  Wayne Lytle is a genius.  I am also a musician and a computer guy, and I can't imagine the amount of work that went into developing this product.

This CD and the second of the same group I have enjoyed alot I first saw this on the public television station on tv and watched it amazed at the computer generated animation, and listened to the music. It was great then as it is now still today. I just wish they would do some more.",1302048000,,479,4.333333333333333

For the most part this is a full screen disc.  Only 2 of the tracks are widescreen.  Take note of this if you are using video projection via video projectors and have issues with full screen presentations and/or cropping run-off.  Had I known this was how the disc was formatted I would not have bought it because everything I do is big screen projection in my basement at home.  Now I am stuck to watching this only on my TV.

It's a great disc to have if you don't mind the aspect ratio being full screen.",1280534400,2,578,4.247706422018348

The way they've layered the songs, starting out simple, and each pass adding another instrument, simply brilliant and beautiful.

Outstanding music, better than the second one, although the second one had better graphics quality.",1269302400,,380,4.8307692307692305

2033298,3,B0001WNL26,"I first saw Animusic on a public radio station and was very intriqued by it! I bought this DVD thinking it would entertain me for longer than a PBS showing.  It did...for a while!  I guess the fantasy is that you're watching real machinery creating the sounds and music but then you realize it's just a cartoon and it gets old!  Walt Disney would have been impressed with it's creativity!  For anyone else, it's a cute cartoon!",1259712000,,427,4.5064935064935066

Being a musician myself and a computer graphics enthusiast myself, I would say Lytle and Crognale have created an ingenious product of superior quality and state-of-the-art.  I remember watching computer graphics in the early 90's on the big screens at the local discotheques, and was very impressed then.  But, unlike any of the New Age composers like Patrick O'Hearn or James Reynolds or Enigma, I prefer to see these imaginary instruments MIDI synced up to the original compositions of Lytle, rather than just elaborate computer graphics with un-MIDI-synced background music.  It is far more interesting to watch the extreme accuracy of these imaginary instruments playing at the correct intervals which reflect the true music.  In my opinion, Lytle and Crognale are music/computer geniuses, and I have definitely become a big fan of Animusic, a new innovation in music and video coupling.  And, yes, of course I love Keith Emerson (Emerson, Lake & Palmer) and Rick Wakeman (Yes) Keep up the EXCELLENT work, guys!",1228176000,,1118,5.212290502793296
2033340,5,B0001WNL26,"Yes, this is computer animation, and proud of it. But the computer is just a production tool, like an artist's brush, and the final product is what counts. That product is gorgeous, and covers a wide range of sensibilities. 'Stick Figures' features likable robotic characters. Most of the other pieces, including 'Pipe Dream' and especially 'Drum Machine' have a more industrial feel, like the offspring of symphony orchestra and an automated assembly line. 'Harmonic Voltage' takes the science fiction look even farther.

The music really makes this stand out. It's not just something to go along with the clever gadgets. The MIDI control tracks literally drive the motion just as they drive the sound - with remarkable cleverness to make sure that the cymbal or drum rotates into position just when it needs to be played. In fact, at lease one of these compositions, 'Aqua Harp,' has taken on a life of its own. A little searching at YouTube shows more than one human-played version of the very enjoyable tune.

Extras help, too. The seven shorts each offer preliminary sketches of the visual concepts and other material showing how the imagery comes together. Informative director's notes help viewers appreciate the behind-the-scenes work, and add an eighth, earlier piece to the collection. You don't need the extras to enjoy these clever and creative pieces though - all you need is a little sense of fun.

Each clipping made them want more.  I think the clips should be longer for the more intricate designs, but I explain to the students that it'll make them want to watch it again and look for something they haven't noticed the last time.
As for the music, it's definitely based on ""basic theories"" of certain genres.  But what's wrong with that?  Some of the crap these kids listen to are rotting their knowledge of the classics. It's not too hard on the ears for adults, but not boring for the younger crowd.
After I play this video (takes 2 class periods) I ask them about their opinions and criticisms.  It allows them to show me what they want to see more of in the future.  My older student will use this lesson for a creative writing project in their homeroom and I send those papers to the creators so they know what the future generations are looking for.

2033380,5,B0001WNL26,"I first heard of Animusic when the music video Pipe Dream was included with the ATI Radeon 9700 series graphics card. I was blown away by the very concept of music-driven animation. Unlike other computer generated animation music videos where scenes are composed to go along with the music, or the music is mixed in to fill in the audial gap that animation leaves, Animusic is a state-of-the-art synthesis of art and science. With the very pulse of the music driving the on-screen characters to play their instruments, you almost get the feeling of real musicians given mechanical form performing for you. And like true music, even if you stare at a single instrument through an entire performance, the illusion is complete because no note goes unplayed. Listening to the bass guitar played by Mr. Stick (on the front of the case), you can see him strike each and every note perfectly, even applying vibrato, and the strings vibrate as well. All in all, this is an excellent piece of computer animation and would be a welcome addition to any DVD collection.

As may be imagined percussion instruments and keyboards play starring roles in most of the animations, though a virtual harp and something that shoots streams of what look like electrically charged particles portray other sounds as well.

In one respect the ""Fantasia"" analogy doesn't work: though each of the ""Animusic"" segments is visually a delight (and would look especially great on an oversize screen, say on a plasma TV), the big flaw for me is that the music itself is not especially interesting, even considering the reasonable duration of each piece--a far cry from Bach, Beethoven or Stravinsky. Then again, I have a limited tolerance for New Age-style repetitiveness. Give this to a child, or a friend who's into this kind of music, and I bet they'll be just delighted.",1150156800,6,1171,5.163157894736842

2033455,5,B0001WNL26,We are a music store.  We showed it to a group of 11-15 year old music students thinking we would only show a minute or so of 2 of the songs.  They wanted to watch the WHOLE DVD.  They loved it!  We were recommended this video by a friend who has a home theater and says his 10 year old has brought over every friend in the neighborhood to watch it.,1142812800,9,349,3.8732394366197185
2033456,3,B0001WNL26,"I saw this product in a store being played on one of their screens. I couldn't walk away. I had to stand there and watch the entire thing!

 Then I hunted down a sales person to tell me what I had been watching! They directed me to shop for it on Amazon.

Now when we have people over,we have it playing to distract them while I put the finishing touches on dinner.

Its always a hit and great ice breaker.",1142726400,2,406,4.0375
2033457,5,B0001WNL26,"Having been a huge fan of instrumental music for quite some time, I found myself quite stirred by a short piece of music heard on my local PBS station very recently.  Together with the eerily beautiful dream-like synthesized melody, (a tune I later established was called `Harmonic Voltage') I was captivated by the accompanying high tech computer-generated images.  The way in which the catchy, electronic music was intricately and perfectly synchronized with the animated musical devices was breathtaking.  Overwhelmed by the design of the very imaginative, abstract looking instruments, how they operated, moved with the music, and the intriguing brilliance of it all, I rushed to my computer to learn something of this strange new art form called `Animusic'.

I have viewed the DVD countless times in just a few days since its arrival from amazon.com.  I now proudly confess to being a new Animusic addict and convert!  I adore how composer/programmer/genius Wayne Lytle marries the rather nostalgic sounding MIDI music to cutting edge animation technology.  I say `nostalgic' because many of the tracks on the album remind me completely of my days as a video-gamer back in the early to mid-nineties, when many of the games would be accompanied by music of a very similar sound to Lytle's compositions on this DVD.  Indeed many of tunes could have been lifted straight from any number of later Super Nintendo games.  I'm heartened that there is still a place for this kind of sound in the 21st Century.  Lytle seems to magically breathe a totally new kind of life into it, thanks to the crisp, sharp graphics system that visualizes the music so fittingly.  If like me, (a little ashamedly) you used to occasionally switch on your video games just to listen to the music tracks - this DVD will be like going to heaven.

It is also the painstaking and intelligently focused commitment to visual perfection and precision that makes this DVD album so great.  Every sound, from the full on pounding synths, to the quietist high-hat is visualized in some way - nothing whatsoever is omitted.  Lytle and his team go one step further, inventing instruments that despite their sometimes other-world appearance and design could almost be considered organic in light of how they seem to literally play themselves, with no human intervention.  Like an optical illusion, your disbelief is suspended, and you find that your brain begins to accept the notion that these robotized contraptions ARE playing themselves and producing wonderfully beautiful electronica as a result.  Jaw dropping moments abound as you delight in how even the tiniest nuances of the music are highlighted - the slap-bass notes in `Acoustic Curves' and the enchanting way in which the tiniest pipe on the organ in `Stick Figures' raises itself to reach just one more note, come to mind especially.  It is exactly this kind of level of attention to detail that lies at the heart of this successful new formula.

Just to prove how broadly appealing Animusic really is, my cat loves it too and will paw the screen in an effort to play the instruments!

Finally, I just HAVE to comment that the `bass tower' on Harmonic Voltage is my absolute favorite animation of all.  Lytle has brilliantly interpreted and visualized an abstract bass synth sound, cunningly using a pedal system that releases light and sound emitting radioactive grape juice.  Surely the DVD is worth getting, just to find out what that's all about?!",1142380800,6,3480,5.006944444444445
2033458,5,B0001WNL26,"I bought both of these DVD's after reading about them in a news paper article and I have to say I was blown away by the animation and synthasised music. I have no hesitaion in awarding five stars.

I stood and stared.  And stared, and stared.

The way the graphics sync to the music and the ""instruments"" play is totally awesome.  I've never seen anything like it.  For some bizarre reason (I probably didn't have any cash on me or something) I didn't pick this DVD up right then, but I plan to buy it ASAP.

By the time he was 5 to 6 months old he began to show anticipation as soon as he heard the first few notes, and would start laughing and bouncing up and down while holding himself up in his playpen!  While I am not a fan of TV's used as babysitters, this is a great teaching tool to use to supplement other activities you do together with your infant, like reading, educational toys, and interactive games.",1140307200,,618,4.442477876106195

Animusic is computer-animated music and it is something any fan of music or animation or any form of art for that matter can enjoy. This is how music itself if portrayed as animated backgrounds, settings and instruments. This one of those DVD's you can't pull away from, otherwise you are going to miss something pretty cool (NOTE: Don't even think of blinking while watching `Pipe Dream'). There are 7 tracks each unique in its own sound and style, so there is something for everyone. From rock, to jazz to acoustic `Animusic' is sheer bliss. When I first saw it was simply amazed. The music is great the sequences are a great spectacle and even though there are no vocals some of the ""characters"" really leave an impression. If you are looking for something unique I highly recommend this DVD. It is a real treat for the senses.",1135728000,6,911,4.62962962962963
2033476,5,B0001WNL26,"Where to start? The music is catchy and appealing, fine. But, it is the animation that captivates you. Balls spew out of a pipe, they hit strings and create musical tones. More balls, more tones. The balls seem to come out randomly, but each time they do, they hit strings and make tones and the tones combine to make a tune. Amazing, more balls more tones - music! It just grows from there in  Pipe Dream which is my personal favorite. Every program, however, is characterized by the same creativity and originality. As each melody develops, the panorama also unfolds you are captivated by the action taking place on the screen. This video will thrill any person who enjoys creativity. It doesn't hurt if you like music, too.

Check it out. You won't regret it.",1134259200,8,762,4.637037037037037

2033479,5,B0001WNL26,"I've been a collector of Virtual Animated DVDs, 3D IMAX related DVDs, thousands of Computer Screensavers, Game demos, etc for many years now. This is the best Animated Music on DVD I've ever encountered so far. This Title will  best suits you if you're a Computer graphic enthusiast,Instrumental or Acoustic music lover, MIDI synthesizer/Organ player or owner. DJs,Musicians,Electronics-Art-related professionals,etc will definitely treasure this DVD. Also ANIMUSIC will benefit owners of HiFidelity Sound System or High-end Video Projectors. IF you share the same interest as me or match any of the above criteria, then this is definitely the perfect DVD you must own in a lifetime! This is 21st century Art! I describe it as the 'Computer Style of future MTV'. The Animations are well engineered & extremely creative. Videos are sharp,colourful & vivid. The music are of high sampling bit rate featuring drum,bass,guitars,synthesizers along with various other instruments. The music sounds like its being dubbed in an SACD quality or being amplified through the 1-Bit Digital Audio Technology. Nevertheless, this isn't just any ordinary DVD-Audio but an intelligently Animated one! Well, we'r not actually looking into its quality of graphics or the kind of musical content it plays but, ""HOW AMAZINGLY IT WORKS""? Its combinations of 'VISUAL,SOUND & CREATIVITY'. The fundamental feature is that the Animations actually synchronize with Music being played so precisely. The Acoustic Music are also being distributed all over your 4 speakers,centre & subwoofer evenly.  You won't get bored or tired even if u put it on the Loop Function. Not to mention that the 'ANGLE OF VIEW' on various instruments animating can be selected individually. Eventually, u won't leave your remote control alone. It's Special Edition Features 5.1 Surround Sound mix, a bonus of 1st Animation in 1996 by ANIMUSIC,a Widescreen version of *chapter Pipe Dreams, etc. My recommendations for ANIMUSIC Special Edition to achieve best performance are..., SOUND works best with any 5.1 Dobly Home Theater Subwoofer System. VIDEO works best with LCD/Plasma TVs and video projectors. And If you own any 2D to 3D viewing system or Virtual Head Mounted TV System,then THIS IS A MUST FOR YOU! Anyway,whatever TV/Hifi you own or whatever your interest may be, you won't regret experiencing this footage. It may be useful to different individuals in many ways like educational,entertainment,business or just plain pleasure. As for my opinion, I had classified it as a 'very rare & unique DVD' among my collections. Before u buy, just imagine its like a combination of various colourful Computer Animated Musical Instruments joining in as a band with your Midi Synthesizer across your very own living room! As a result u'll get the State-of-Art MTV, The Computer Way. Animation & Music begins here...IT'S EXTREMELY AWESOME! I can't wait for ANIMUSIC 2 launching this October 29.....

all the best,

2033507,5,B0001WNL26,"I was first made aware of this DVD from a video clip on PBS.  It is an excellent program, at least on the same par as the ""Mind's Eye"" computer animation series, with the usual technical advances in the art since ""Mind's Eye"" was produced.

The quality is excellent, both visually and aurally.  I always thought that computer animation and music could be successfully integrated in some way, and ""Animusic"" is the successful result.  Unlike other computer animation subjects, where the music drives or complements the action, in ""Animusic,"" the music IS the action.

The viewer is transported to a futuristic concert where the musician is a complex, sophisticated computer able to weave many intricate melodies and harmonies at once, playing instruments that are very futuristic -- laser-beam-controlled guitars, a four-handed drum kit, violins that seem to play themselves, string and metal harps played by flying balls, huge clockwork drum kits, high-voltage musical transformers, and other fantasic, out-of-this-world musical instruments of the sort that one might find only in a science fiction novel.

It is easy to see how one can be drawn into the different musical settings and be mesmerized by the music and the visual surroundings.  In addition, this DVD has various ""angles"" available on each track that allow the viewer to watch a separate instrument as it is played or sits idle over the course of the selection.

This DVD is a very good starting point for those who have never before experienced computer animation firsthand.  The producers have done a splendid job on ""Animusic"" by making the music literally come alive.

There are seven selections on this DVD:

1.  Future Retro

2.  Stick Figures

3.  Aqua Harp

4.  Drum Machine

5.  Pipe Dream

6.  Acoustic Curves

7.  Harmonic Voltage

Each selection conveys a different mood, using unique  instruments and realistic backgrounds.  My personal favorites are 1, 5 and 7.

I am very impressed with ""Animusic.""  I await, with great anticipation, the release of ""Animusic 2"" later this Fall.

2033510,3,B0001WNL26,"Have you ever seen a high-quality computer-animated movie on a high-resolution display? The sharpness, clarity, and color can be breathtaking.

When my son and I saw the small-frame sample clips on the ANIMUSIC website, we knew we had to order the DVD. We didn't expect ANIMUSIC to look like a Pixar feature, but when it arrived, the video quality was a real letdown.

We tried the ANIMUSIC DVD on three devices:

  _ A standalone DVD player with a 25"" TV

  _ A portable PC with a 1024x768 LCD display and average graphics processor

  _ A fast desktop PC with a 1280x1024 LCD display and fast graphics card

On each, the video looked as though it was recorded from an analog source, like a videotape, rather than a digital one. During pans, the edges of objects visibly pixilated. The colors were dull. The picture was fuzzy and showed the ""halos"" characteristic of highly-compressed JPG images, leaving surfaces and textures unrealistic-looking. (If I didn't know better, I'd wonder if they recorded it by pointing a videocam at a monitor, as in ""Tron,"" Disney's pioneering 1982 feature.)

Producing 3D animation is very time-consuming, even with powerful equipment. Perhaps Wayne Lytle had to use a lower resolution to speed up his rendering time (to meet distribution deadlines?). Or maybe he was limited by his production environment. Or maybe the DVD was just poorly mastered. For whatever reason, ANIMUSIC is NOT digital-quality video---not even close.

I agree that ANIMUSIC's concept and animation are ingenious, and the music rocks. That makes it all the sadder that the DVD wasn't produced with more care.",1109635200,20,1617,5.007490636704119
