8359378,5,B002ADO6B4,"I finally have my no-man DVD after a slightly delayed release. It was well worth the wait. Any fan of no-man should not hesitate to buy this. The concert on the first DVD is wonderful, showcasing Tim's and Steven's talent with a strong supporting band and it includes ""truenorth"" which in my opinion is the ultimate no-man song. Former member Ben Coleman also makes an appearance. The second DVD is also great. It has a career spanning documentary on the band which is very informative showing the changes they have gone through and includes interviews with Tim, Steven and other members past and present. You also get a no-man career chronology and a few videos including a new, very touching one for ""back when you were beautiful"". I can't wait for their next album. Hopefully sooner than later.",1262044800,2,797,4.782608695652174
