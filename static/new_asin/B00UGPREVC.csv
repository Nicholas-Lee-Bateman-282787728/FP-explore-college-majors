8705920,5,B00UGPREVC,"The brilliant Argentinian essayist Ernesto Sabato (Hombres y engranajes) wrote: In most of brothels you can breathe an infinite solitude.

The house of pleasures is a defying account of the horrid ambiance of the prostitution in Paris at the threshold of XX century.

The sad ambiance of a luxury brothel through the mechanical existence of these ladies. But mainly, the film focuses around the brutal attack committed on the face of a pros.

I would just to add a key premise. Victor Hugo wrote about the sinister customs of sordid gangs which ruined the life of orphans and homeless in Paris streets. Go for a clever film The man who laughs (Conrad Veit) of the thirties to make the round circle.

Shocking and reflective film.  Beatifully filmed and marvelously performed by the entire crew.",1494028800,,794,4.895522388059701

8705922,5,B00UGPREVC,"This takes place in a Paris brothel just before and just after the start of the 20th century. While there is a lot of nudity and sex, the film is almost always anti-erotic, as it is so clear that the women are less than enthusiastic participants. Interestingly, I found the only moments with any erotic charge were moments between the women themselves, who support each other in what amounts to indentured servitude. Occasionally we feel the heat of human connection between them in a look, a touch, and that is far more sensual than anything they share with their clients, which is often degrading, and occasionally violent.

Indeed, under the 'instant video' listing I saw a lot of complaints about the film not being 'sexy', which is part of the whole point. But I think the advertising, cover images, etc. can understandably lead people to expect a hot soft-core porn experience, and not a thoughtful, deliberately paced, and socially political art-film.

The film is a look at the trap poor women found themselves in, when being a prostitute was one of the only ways to make your own money, and other professions had just as many drawbacks (one woman speaks of giving up being a washer-woman because her lungs were becoming damaged from breathing ammonia all day). But the irony is, the 'expenses' of being a well kept prostitute (from room and board to perfume) are more than the women can take in, so they inevitably fall deeper and deeper into debt. Like sharecroppers, they soon 'owe their soul to the company store'.

This isn't a naturalistic film in the usual sense. It jumps around in time - something we sometimes only realize because we'll see a moment we'd watched earlier happen a second time, but in this case from a new perspective or in a new context. It's 'slow' by our usual standards, and is less about plot than about captured moments that build to something larger. It also uses anachronistic, modern music to great effect. But for all it's intentional artifice, there is a feeling of an honest sort of hyper-reality here. In the same way a poem can capture the feeling of a sunny day better than a lot of scientific explanation, so too does this poetic film capture a complex and sad world in a way that lets you feel a sense of understanding and empathy more than straight forward naturalism might.

The film-making itself is of a very high order. The cinematography and acting are both first rate, and there is a sequence near the end that combined acting, images and music to give me chills in the rare way sequences by great film-makers can sometimes do. Not every choice works, but this is a bold, challenging and emotional film. It doesn't tell you what to think, it just creates a world, invites you inside and allows you to draw your own conclusions. I suspect I will get even more from it on a second viewing.",1458259200,3,2844,4.6706586826347305
