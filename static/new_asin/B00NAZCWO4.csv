8677061,3,B00NAZCWO4,"These DVDs were for my mom. She has taken some live dance lessons, but needed more practice at home. These DVDs are not as helpful for beginners like her where slow step-by-step instructions are needed. I have to play this in slow motion for her everytime she watches these. I have another DVD that I purchased for her a long time ago and she loves that DVD because the instructor teaches at her pace. I was also not too impress with the quality of how these DVDs were made. It looks like DVDs that I can burn at home and slap a printed CD sticker on it. I'm just glad that they run in our DVD player and there's no telling when they will stop working with my mom's not-so-careful handling of anything breakable.",1446422400,5,712,4.32089552238806

8677064,5,B00NAZCWO4,"This DVD set was great for me because about my own ability with dancing is that I can find a beat. Well if you can find a beat then youll be able to dance with this (and even if you cant find a beat if you can walk you can dance). Lyndsie, Ryan and Hylie really helped me really get what I needed to do.
Before you start any of the dances they show you what its going to look like. Then they take you through each step slowly, without music so you can go at your own pace. They add in new aspects gradually so you have time to understand. And all of this happens before you get up to speed. So if you're not so great at dancing (like me) then youll be able to follow along by starting slow and building off of that.
Another great thing is that you're not just going to learn the basics of the dance. Youre actually going to be able to learn some of the more complex steps so that when you actually get out there and start dancing youll look like a pro (and no one will know you learned in your living room).",1415059200,5,1007,3.9411764705882355
8677065,5,B00NAZCWO4,I used to hate dancing because it made me feel inadequate. I basically used to be as stiff as a rod on a dance floor. I wouldnt dare attempt to dance with a partner. They wouldve been ready to hit me after I trampled their poor feet. I finally sucked it up and made an effort to learn how to dance the right way. I feel much more confident after learning through these DVDs. Before I  would avoid dancing at all costs unless I was at home with my headphones in. Now I can enjoy dancing in public just like everyone else.,1412553600,3,520,4.098039215686274
8677066,5,B00NAZCWO4,"So this ballroom dance club recently opened up nearby, and they hold occasional festivities and events where partners are invited to go and dance. Im currently learning from this DVD set with my partner, and so far its going really well! :) (Luckily, we have some good dance chemistry haha) I do suggest practicing somewhere with a bit of room, cause some of the dances involve traveling around. Each dance shown begins with the first basic steps, and as you move on you learn the more advanced moves. And because these dances are based on simple foundational steps with added flare movements, you can go out dancing the Fox Trot just by getting the first 5-10 minutes down.

I prefer this method of learning, as opposed to physical classes, because you're at the comfort of your own home- you can pause and rewind and not worry about delaying anyone. You can go back to it whenever you want, in case you ever forget the moves. All the instructions are simple and flow at a nice easy pace. Your instructors are Hylie, who provides directions and advice for each step and dance, and you also have Ryan and Lindsey, the wonderful dancers, who are great to follow along to.
I also really like how they drill the moves; you first run through them slowly a couple of times, then dance along with music, until you combine the different moves in the end; best way to learn in my opinion.

Would definitely recommend if you're looking into learning partner dances, or if you ever wanted to have these dances up your sleeve for a night out.

Tip: Always practice in front of the mirror, so you can work on correct posture and graceful movements.

Tip 2: Once you get the dances down, Youtube some fox trot or Cha cha music, and practice along to it. Its really fun!",1412294400,8,1756,4.5474683544303796
