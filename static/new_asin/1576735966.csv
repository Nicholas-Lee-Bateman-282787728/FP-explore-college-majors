7798956,5,1576735966,"I purchased this thinking that all 8 unit lessons would be included--however, this must have been just one of three tapes--thus the low price.  Just check with the seller before you purchase.  The three lessons I received on the tape were very good! (I do not fault the seller as I see NO indication on the outside of the packaging box that states which lessons are included--publisher must have made the same generic cover for all the tapes).  This is not the large clam shell case that holds all the VHS tapes--instead it is just one of the VHS tapes from that clam shell.",1297123200,,574,4.5
