5181801,5,B008TXGILK,"This is my first fan veil video purchase and after watching it, I feel like I don't need to look for any more to add to my collection. The instructor covered so much, from basics on different fan veil sizes, the proper ways to hold them, to learning several combinations and more. She also mentions where to buy fan veils. I highly recommend this video.",1373328000,3,353,4.446153846153846
5181802,5,B008TXGILK,"There's very few instructional videos on dancing with fan veils but this one would still be tops if there were many.  Sedona Soulfire clearly explains great moves, techniques and tips.  The only thing I'd add is the challenge of dancing simultaneously while manipulating the fan veils in a graceful manner.  Maybe more drills emphasizing this.",1371859200,2,343,5.2
5181803,5,B008TXGILK,Fantastic Fan Veils DVD is a great tool to add to your dance resources.  It is very user friendly for all levels.,1369180800,,113,4.136363636363637
5181804,5,B008TXGILK,"I have gained a modest familiarity with fan veils through learning choreographies in workshops, and this video is just what I was looking for to expand my knowledge, movement vocabulary, and comfort level with this prop. The instructor has a friendly and relaxed delivery style that sets a wonderful tone for the video. The material is presented clearly, and in a logical progression.  The material starts very simply, and she gradually adds difficulty.  There is a lot of content to this video--more than enough to hold the viewer's interest and keep a dancer busy learning for quite a while! I definitely feel like I got my money's worth with this. Unlike many instructionals, in which the dancer presents movements in rapid-fire succession with little or no time to practice them, Sedona Soulfire provides adequate time to practice the movements along with her. I love the creative names that she gives to the movements--that really helps to make them stick in my memory, and to create beautiful and effective imagery while dancing with the fans. The performance section at the end is artistic, graceful, and captivating. The feeling of her dance has an authenticity to it that really draws the viewer in.",1363132800,,1208,5.0049751243781095

5181807,5,B008TXGILK,"I strongly recommend the dvd for everyone looking to drill their moves with fan veils.

The best feature is the camera position that allow to see the explanation in a better way like the arms posture and gripping.

All the moves were breakdown in a way that even for me was easy.  (I'm a slow learner)

Bottom line the dvd is the best!  For all the dancers who enjoy fan veils.",1350777600,6,377,4.253521126760563
5181808,5,B008TXGILK,"This is definitely one of the better dancing DVDs I've seen so far.  The teacher starts off very basic: how to hold your fan veil, open and close it, where it should be in relation to your arms, and basic dance posture.  For each move, she very clearly demonstrates how it should be done in a way that is easy to understand and master.

She has a couple different sections on the DVD, starting with a warm-up, then basics, then flourishes, and onto turns and so forth.  At the beginning of each section, she demonstrates each of the moves she's teaching in the section a couple times, then moves onto the next.  After a series of about 6-10 moves, she goes to an 8-count drill, where she does each of the moves four times, then moves onto the next.  This is done in time to music, and she goes through each 8-count twice.  The result is that it helps you practice, but also it helps cement each of the moves in your memory.

Later, she goes more in-depth with both single fan veil and double fan veil combos, as well as tips on how to transition between the moves.

At the end of the DVD, there is a performance where she uses a lot of the techniques discussed in the lessons.  It's a great source of ideas for things to do in your own performance.

I am definitely a new dancer; I've only been belly dancing for about six months.  After seeing a troupe do a routine with fan veils though, I knew I wanted to learn more about them.  This DVD is a fantastic starting block for that.  It will give you a good foundation of solid technique, as well as some basic moves that you can combine in your own performances.

Really, the only issue I have with this DVD is the one that I have with most DVDs; it's quite annoying to use it to drill to often, because you have to sit through (or painstakingly fast-forward through) the basics before you can get to the actual drills.  I do wish they would make a separate section with just the drills in them.  Other than that, this is definitely a fantastic DVD for someone just getting into fan veils, or someone who's only moderately good with them or wants to brush up on the basics.",1349827200,5,2123,4.293969849246231

8530300,4,B008TXGILK,"Fan veils technique broken down in detail. concrete explanation and building up as she goes.

I'm giving it four starts and not five for video technical reasons that i think it could've been shot better, also because i don't think warm up was anything special or enough.

I'd recommend it for intermediate to professional level belly dancers.
