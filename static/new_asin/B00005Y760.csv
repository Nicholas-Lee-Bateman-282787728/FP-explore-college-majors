1674830,4,B00005Y760,"The novels of James M. Cain were a true challenge to filmmakers of the 1940s and 1950s. With censorship still very much an issue, screenwriters and directors could only hint, or make oblique reference to the very steamy plots and situations he devised. At least two true Cain-inspired classics came out of this era (DOUBLE INDEMNITY and the original THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE); interestingly, when censorship was no longer an issue, the remake of POSTMAN with its many sex scenes, didn't really work. SLIGHTLY SCARLET is hardly in a class with those two 40s film noir masterpieces, but in its own way, it's a little gem of a melodrama . Misses Dahl and Fleming, two of the screen's most beautiful reheads who are thankfully still with us, battle it out for screen time and glory, and although Ms. Dahl certainly has the flashier part, and gives an appropriately sizzling performance, Ms. Fleming more than holds her own as the ""good"" sister (the fact that she seems to be sleeping with two men at the same time is never mentioned, but the inference is pretty clear). In any event, both women are extremely effective, as is John Payne, here in his tough-guy period (like Dick Powell, he went from grinning, singing juvenile in the 1930s/early 1940s to become one of the screen's more interesting morally ambiguous men in a series of film noir-type films of the late 1940s/early 1950s). Plenty of violence, and solid direction from veteran Allan Dwan make this a very watchable film.
The VCI Entertainment DVD is pretty good; color is a little washed-out (you can see the more vivid color in the trailer), but it is in widescreen (RKO's answer to Cinemascope, thanks to mogul Howard Hughes, was dubbed ""Superscope""), and there are some cool extras, including a still gallery, James Cain bio etc. All in all, worth your time.",1209859200,8,1827,4.821656050955414
1674831,4,B00005Y760,"""Slightly Scarlet"" is an excellent melodrama/film noir. The performances are good and so is the script. I haven't seen Arlene Dahl in many films and was surprised at how good she was in this film.
The colour is excellent but I was quite upset by all the scratches on the print. I don't know if it was just my copy or if that is simply the quality of the old film. About 20% of the film has scratches on the visuals which, to me, is extremely annoying.

1674832,3,B00005Y760,"""Slightly Scarlet"" was released in 1956.  This was a period when the film industry had been rocked on its heels by what Hollywood insiders referred to sarcastically as that ""little black box"" that we call television.

Since this was the period before color television or wide screens the idea was to exploit the advantage that the film medium had by supplying viewers with what television lacked.  They sought to motivate television viewers out of their living room easy chairs and back into theaters by providing luscious color and wide screen entertainment.

The trailer for ""Slightly Scarlet"" revealed the marketing strategy of producer Benedict Bogeaus.  To use the quote that football coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns used to describe the impact of his superstar fullback Jim Brown in the days before both of them reached the Hall of Fame in their respective categories, ""If you've got a cannon you shoot it.""

What was revealed in the trailer was the emphasis on the two female stars.  They were referred to as ""the two most beautiful redheads"" in films.  There could be little doubt that the torrid redheads starring in ""Slightly Scarlet"" deserved the accolade.  The only injustice was that the other two redhead beauties of the period, Susan Hayward and Maureen O'Hara, were left out of the equation, but because they were not in the film the omission was therefore understandable.

Rhonda Fleming, who had been discovered in her teens by Henry Willson, who would as an agent guide the careers of Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and Guy Madison, and who was then casting director for David O. Selznick, made an eye catching debut playing a psychopath with nymphomaniacal tendencies who also likes to physically hurt men in the great Alfred Hitchcock hit, ""Spellbound.""

So impressive was Fleming's beauty that on one occasion a director and his cinematographer tried diligently on one occasion to photograph her at every conceivable angle to see if they could make her look bad in at least one shot.  They were impressed to discover that they could not.  Fleming's natural beauty prevailed in every instance.

Fleming in ""Slightly Scarlet"" plays an executive secretary to a man seeking to reform a city riddled with gangland corruption.  Fleming's life becomes complicated when her sister gets out of jail and moves in with her.

The devastating Arlene Dahl, one of the few women who could hold her own against Fleming, the actress who was called ""The queen of Technicolor"" for good reason, is cast as Fleming's sister.  She is both a nymphomaniac and a kleptomaniac, so Fleming is naturally kept busy looking after her.

John Payne, after having a falling out with mob boss Ted de Corsia, seeks help from Fleming and quickly falls in love with her.  Dahl complicates things by making a move of her own.

Dahl does such a job of investing her part with gusto, performing in a manner reminiscent of Carol Baker in ""Baby Doll,"" that Leonard Maltin in his review of ""Slightly Scarlet"" credits the Minnesota born beauty with ""stealing the film.""

Director Allan Dwan, a veteran of films who began in the silents after a stint as an assistant football coach at his alma mater, Notre Dame, knew about the ""twin cannons"" he had to shoot in this film, the devastating beauty of two torrid redheads.  Considering it was the fifties with the Breen Office very much a factor, the film is daring in the manner that Fleming and Dahl are portrayed as well as attired.

Dwan wisely opts for colorful cinema over realism in a film moving in that direction.  For instance, when Fleming springs Dahl from jail the sister who has just been released is attired in the manner of a rich man's wife ready to go shopping on Rodeo Drive.",1172188800,13,3720,4.849683544303797
1674833,3,B00005Y760,"This is a movie that you will enjoy while watching but will also easily forget.  If you like crime films from the classic movie era, this is one you'll enjoy.  Rhonda Fleming and Arlene Dahl are great as the good sister/bad sister team, even if Dahl isn't always believeable as the tough chick she's playing.  John Payne is also quite effective as the man torn between the two sisters, and also torn between the two sides of the law.  Rhonda Fleming is a raving beauty in her prime here, and the force of her looks and personality are the main strength behind the film.  This is not The Big Sleep or The Maltese Falcon, but in the world of dime-a-dozen crime thrillers, this gets a place in the top-to-middle of the pack.",1154995200,7,721,4.431818181818182
1674834,4,B00005Y760,"This is a fastmoving filmnoir in blazing TECHNICOLOR - and the better for it. The photography by John Alton is spectacular as are the set design and costumes(with Arlene Dahl having a finger in even that)...

John Payne(from SUN VALLEY SERENADE-fame) is quite good as the worldweary guy who take what croms that are offered... Unlike Bogart or Cagney he is a believable character with no high drama or over the top macho stuff.  Ted deCorsia is brilliant as Sully the hoodlum - the best I`ve seen really...

But it is ARLENE DAHL who steals the show. At first she is just glamour, but she emerges to what surely is a performance of Oscar material.

Her performance is a beauty to behold - as critic Alison DeWytt in the 20th Century-Fox film ""All About Eve"" would say: ""What a PERFORMANCE... Full of FIRE and music....!""

It`s regrettable that this film has little reputation, because it is 90 minutes of excitement, of fun and intrigue.

I have come to love Arlene Dahl over the years. Posterity names her only as a decorative plant, but with other Norwegian girls in US and UK films - GRETA GYNT, SIGRID GURIE and VERA ZORINA - she remains sadly underrated...

At home I have a collection of films starring these women. I call it the ""Susan Dahl collection"" hehehe - which includes THE GOLDWYN FOLLIES, ALGIERS, THE ADVENTURES OF MARCO POLO(all 1938), THE DARK EYES OF LONDON 1939, THREE FACES WEST, I WAS AN ADVENTURESS(both 1940), LOUISIANA PURCHASE 1941, TAKE MY LIFE, DEAR MURDERER(both 1947), THE OUTRIDERS, THREE LITTLE WORDS(both 1950), SLIGHTLY SCARLET of course - THE VIKINGS(filmed in Norway)1958 and JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH 1959.

These films showcase these underrated Norwegian girls and themes THAT SHOULD N O T be neglected or forgotten...

The Rhonda Fleming/Arlene Dahl chemistry is good and they seem indeed to be the source of many a trash-book cover of any detective story....

I hope SLIGHTLY SCARLET will find the vast audience it deserves with the likes of LAURA, DOUBLE INDEMNITY and TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT.",1137888000,26,2041,4.805714285714286
1674835,3,B00005Y760,"""Slightly Scarlet"" was adapted from James M. Cain's novel ""Love's Lovely Counterfeit"". Cain's novels were fodder for some of the 1940s most memorable film noirs, and this one should have been too. But instead of a 1940s hard-boiled, cynical, nuanced film noir in black-and-white, we have a very colorful, sentimental, over-the-top 1950s mishmash. Dorothy Lyons (Arlene Dahl), kleptomaniac, has been released from prison into the waiting arms of her loving, affluent sister June (Rhonda Fleming). June is secretary and girlfriend to Mr. Frank Jansen (Kent Taylor), who is running for mayor on promises to clean up corruption in the city government. Solly Caspar (Ted de Corsia), ""the leader of all that is vile and corrupt"" in Bay City, employs a man named Ben Grace (John Payne) to dig up dirt on Jansen. When that fails, Caspar kills Jansen's supporter, publisher Norman Marlowe. Ben Grace offers June proof of the crime to tip the mayoral election in Jansen's favor, and June transfers her affections to Ben. But uncontrollable Dorothy wants Ben too. And Ben's murky motives become clear.

""Slightly Scarlet"" should have been film noir, but it tries very hard not to be. This is understandable, as the popularity of hard-boiled crime and staccato dialogue had nearly passed by 1956. And it's never quite fair to ask a film to be a different film. But, as I was watching it, I couldn't help thinking that ""Slightly Scarlet"" has all the material for a good film but entirely the wrong attitude. It would have benefited considerably from being less sentimental, more understated, and adopting a less patronizing attitude toward its female characters. Two of the main characters are women, yet they can't be interesting in ridiculous costumes, cone bras, and a world that thinks ""A lovely girl like you, you shouldn't have to worry about a thing -except looking beautiful. And running a home for a man who loves you."" Attempts to make June look like a post-war pinup result in some comical wardrobe choices and weak writing. Promiscuous, alcoholic, kleptomaniac Dorothy is underutilized as source of conflict. Ted de Corsia plays Solly Caspar with such over-the-top swagger that he's a parody of a gangster.

And the colors. Low key specialist John Alton filmed ""Slightly Scarlet"" in Technicolor. To his credit, Alton is able to disguise the film's limited budget with color and light. But it's garish. I never got used to June and Dorothy's fluorescent orange hair. The film's palette is a swirl of 1950s oranges, blues, teals, and pinks. Alton does make use of his trademark shadows, but it doesn't produce the subtle tonality that it would in black-and-white, because the color film doesn't have enough tonal range. So I don't think the low key lighting looks very good. ""Slightly Scarlet"" isn't a bad film. It just doesn't have the depth that its begging for. Get rid of the ridiculous costumes; hard-boil the gangsters; strengthen Ben and June's characters and delineate them better; use Dorothy as a real threat instead of a joke; let June become a tragic character and the emotional center of the film....and you have an interesting film noir about people who fall victim to their own weaknesses. As it is, ""Slightly Scarlet""'s over-the-top approach doesn't suit the subject. It borders on camp.

The DVD (VCI Entertainment 2002): This print of the film is generally good but does have a few instances of white vertical lines and one instance of some dark distortion. Bonus features include a good audio commentary by mystery writer Max Collins. Collins frequently compares the novel to the film, discusses characters, themes, visual style, James Cain's work, and the people involved in the film. Other bonus features are: A ""Photo Gallery"" (1  min) slide show of b&w stills. The ""James Cain Bio""(2 min) is rolling text and includes and selective filmography. ""James Cain Book Gallery"" (3  min) is a slideshow of original book jacket covers. There are trailers for ""Slightly Scarlet"", ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946), and ""Double Indemnity"" (1947).",1132444800,4,4061,5.073353293413174
1674836,4,B00005Y760,"This is a fine John Payne movie.  It is not a high budget spectacular, but just a finely written little movie.  Given the time it was made, it was more than ""slightly scarlet.""  It will seem tame by today's standards, but it is still worth a watch.  It is nicely plotted and acted but somewhat soap opera-ish.  Go on and try it!",1061942400,,328,4.225806451612903
1674837,5,B00005Y760,"I like this 50's pulp film because it's an example of what must have been considered ""adult"" back then. Tough, brutal--with ""girlie"" shots of redhead Rhonda Fleming in scanty outfits and the all-out performance of Arlene Dahl as her klepto/nympho/psycho sister-both vying for the he-man pleasures of hunky John Payne and everyone caught up in Big City Corruption and Scandal. Lushly photographed and tightly directed ,this is fun stuff--worth repeat viewings any time. Good quality DVD product from VCI that's in vivid 50's color.

I hope more movies with these gorgeous actresses are released on DVD.I didn't know VCI and was a little

1674839,5,B00005Y760,"The DVD from VCI presents this film in its widescreen version and the technicolor photography by JOHN ALTON looks terrific. I admit I was at first perplexed by the color: it did not seem necessary. So I turned the color off on the TV and watched some scenes in black & white--they looked terriic, vintage Alton. But watching again in color I realized what may be the very special quality this film has: it looks like those PULP CRIME NOVEL COVERS we have all enjoyed over the years. The reds, greens, blues, yellows, etc of those wonderful old covers seem to be reproduced here. In combination with the very pulpy, James M. Cain-based plotline, we have an extremely FUN movie.
Rhonda Fleming and Arlene Dahl play sisters who share some sort of duplicitous secret from childhood. Director Alan Dwan (who replaced Kurt Neumann for this film) makes sure we appreciate the doppelgangerishness of the actresses from the opening scene--Fleming picks up Dahl as she exits prison and the two embrace in that movie-ish way, cheek-to-cheek, so their striking similarity of features and RED HAIR can be fully displayed. Fleming really could act, and she gets some choice scenes, but Dahl tends to steal most of Fleming's thunder with her pouty, Dorothy Malone-like, bad girl characterization.
John Payne--by 1956 and aging matinee idol--makes a pretty good conflicted lead. But the other real standout is Ted de Corsia as a mean, mean villain along the lines of Lawrence Tierney or Ward Bond. De Corsia gets to chew garishly colored scenery at several turns.
It's always a pleasure to see the ubiquitous Ellen Corby as Fleming's thankless and clueless housekeeper (""what should I make for supper?""..oops she's being arrested!). And one never tires of Frank Gerstle and Lance Fuller (one of de Corsia's thugs)
The disc has an informative commentary by mystery writer/filmmaker Max Collins. Extras really make the package: a static, luridly-colored main menu leads (via realistic-sounding gunshots!) to the extras menu, which includes a nicely done James M. Cain bio and a little panorama of color reproductions of Cain pulp covers from Collins' own collections. There are also some trailers: for ""Slightly Scarlet"" (this one looks good) and atrociously awful-looking ones for ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"".
Highly enjoyable all around.",1019174400,70,2349,5.135770234986945

1674854,4,B00005Y760,"Solly Caspar was old school, old school by 1950s new ways, an old school hood strictly from some back street tenement neighborhood fighting and clawing his way out to easy street with fists, guns, knives whatever it took. Took out whoever he needed to take out in order to move up the food chain, move up fast and not wait for guys to retire or anything like that. Yeah, Solly claimed he knew Al, Bugsy, Meyer, Lucky (before they shipped him back to Italy), hell, Don Corleone too, all the old time hoods who were strictly from some back street tenement neighborhoods fighting and clawing their way out to easy street with fists, guns, knives whatever it. So no question Solly had the old methods down pat. Problem was, 1950s problem, that the old ways were pass caused too many waves, were bad for business. And that was the point in the old days to run and hold on to your market share in the rackets, the ones that counted, gambling, drugs, guns, women all you needed was big fists, big guns and long knives. But in the whirlwind American Century 1950s you needed brains, and plenty of them to hold to your end, to hold off the competition. You needed guys like suave all-angles Ben (played by John Payne), college guys, college guys with larceny in their hearts, and huge wanting habits not to be filled by being a rung in some legit operation. So that, centrally, is the dramatic  tension, well, that and some heavy innuendo sex just off to the side in the film under review, Slightly Scarlet, a Technicolor film noir of sorts if that is possible, possible for noirs to be in color.

Here is the wrap up. Solly is the crime boss of corrupt, crooked, wide open Bay City insured by having the city pols wired to his operations who is faced with a problem. (They always have a Bay City in these things when they want to do a California scene but they really mean L.A. which was corrupt, crooked and wide open for a long time in those days, now too for that matter.) A clean no-nonsense guy who was not from hunger, had his own resources, and did not need the job of mayor to make his fortune. Such a guy was a problem to the sweet setup that Solly had so he went into action. Not against Mr. Clean but the prominent publisher, the do-gooder newspaper publisher who was backing him and making a stink about the then current city administration.
And this was when Solly showed his old school form which if he thought about it for a moment, something he might have been incapable of when he got his dander up, he could have saved himself from the big step-off if had listened to Ben for one minute (although in the end Ben had old Solly figured, had him down pat and was able to walk into the sweet set-up with only a few ruffled feather). Instead of going with the flow and working out some deal with the new guy on the block, that Mr. Clean or one of his underlings, Solly had to prove his old school ways by slapping the sick old publisher around causing him to have a heart attack. Then Solly in true form, which every corner boy in America, or maybe the world could appreciate, had him thrown out the window by a couple of his boys. Nice touch and Al, Bugsy, and Lucky would have been proud but all it got Solly was Mr. Clean elected as the new mayor and a one way trip to Mexico to cool out until things calmed down. Naturally Solly didn't like the idea of exile, especially as he began to get wise that Ben was making the big move to replace him, maybe permanently. Solly had some old school thoughts about that matter, no question.

But that is Solly and his small problems which in no way on this good green earth are going to make movie-goers rise up against his fate. No, Solly when the deal went down was just a bit player, a bit player against the love angle that every film noir, in color or otherwise, needs to round out the plot. See that Mr. Clean had a secretary, a girl Friday really, June (played by the luscious, there is no other word for her, buxom red-haired Rhonda Fleming who ignited many a midnight dream in the 1950s Technicolor film world) who was the power behind the throne, who kept his spirits up and whom she admired as the right guy to run the city and maybe run her too. But see that is where things got complicated because she fell for Ben, fell hard for a while, who was clearly no good for her when that deal went down. And had a, well, lets call her high-spirited, unstable, troubled and bothered younger sister, Dorothy (played by Arlene Dahl who played the vixed, flirty, walk on the wild side just for the hell of it man trap to a tee). See Dorothy just out of stir and tired of looking at women all day wants up and coming Ben too. And what Dotty wants Dotty has got to have whatever the consequences.

But June really is a girl Friday and an angel of mercy despite the wanting the same man problem with sis. She for her own reasons is committed to keeping Dotty out of the slammer and to keeping Mr. Clean on his task of cleaning up L.A. (oops Bay City). In the end it was  not clear whether she could save Dotty or Ben. Ben, (who when last seen was bleeding like a sieve from old school Sollys root-a-toot-toot). See Solly, old school or new, didn't want to be squeezed down the food chain, got tired of exile and tired of Bens clever squeeze plays to run his rackets. So against all good judgment Solly came back to settle some scores, the old school way and Ben paid the price. Solly too because he is right now being set up for the big step off. But that is that.",1420761600,,5511,4.295192307692307

John Payne is fine as a thug with a conscience who gets mixed up with two very neurotic sisters, who may or may not be fatal attractions. Many critics and reviewers have mentioned the lesbian undertones in this story, but they're so subtle they may just as well be nonexistent. Still, sexual pathology is pretty extreme, and there are some compellingly offbeat scenes of romance and violence. The print on this DVD wasn't so stellar, unfortunately, and there was some horizontal banding on the copy I purchased. The color is saturated, perhaps a bit too so. The settings are attractive and some of the symbolism is clever. The film is entertaining, but loses steam in an ending that feels a bit like a cop-out. For noir enthusiasts and fans of the stars, I'd say take a look. Others may wonder what all the fuss is about.

How can a secretary (Rhonda Fleming) afford beautiful clothes, a new convertible, and a large suburban home -- complete with maid, on her salary alone? There are hints she may be her wealthy employer's mistress as well as secretary. A new crime boss (John Payne) is a likable, low key fellow who wants to specialize in nonviolent crimes, such as gambling. Somewhere in the middle is the secretary's kleptomaniac sister (Arlene Dahl) who is clearly mentally ill and steals because she enjoys it. Does she deserve another prison term? Even the straight-arrow mayor is willing to use influence to keep his secretary's sister out of prison. It seems we are all ""slightly scarlet"".

Though filmed in wide-screen and color -- unusual for a film noir, acclaimed cinematographer John Alton makes effective use of deep shadows to narrow the viewer's perspective when appropriate. The main character's wide, colorful, flatly-lit suburban life becomes increasingly shadowy as her involvement with gangsters deepens.

The commentary track must be one of the worst ever. After telling us the film script is an improvement on the original book, the speaker proceeds to talk about the book, the author, and other books by the author - seldom mentioning the film at all. That's unfortunate because when he does mention the film he usually has something interesting to say about it.",1219795200,8,1737,5.241007194244604

PQ is ok but not sensational. DVD seems mastered from an unconverted PAL source (-> slight combing effects) - hence resulting in running time of 94 (4% PAL speed-up) instead of 99 (orig.).
