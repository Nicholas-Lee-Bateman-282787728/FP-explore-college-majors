3010444,4,B000Y11B8U,"We watched ""A Civil Action"" for my wifes school project and found it quite revealing.  It shows how a lawyer gave up everything to fight two large corporations to correct environmental problems they caused.  The Lawyer was young, naive and unstructured which made his results less than stellar.  However, he has since matured and won some very  important cases to make companies responsible for poluting our environment (and killing people).

The product arrived on time in Excellent condition.  Just like new!

Thanks.

3010461,4,B000Y11B8U,"This was a pretty good deal on a movie I'd seen before (but not for a long time)--A Civil Action and Insider a movie about a whistle-blower in the cigarette industry.  John Travolta starts out as an arrogant, money-hungry lawyer who ends up actually having a heart when he represents people who are fighting for their very lives against a company who could care less about the havoc they're wreaking on a small town.  It will make you angry because you know this has happened before, is still happening and will continue to happen as long as people put money before others' welfare.

In The Insider, Russell Crowe does a good job of playing the whistle blower who's life starts falling apart when he tries to do the right thing.  Al Pacino (not one of my favorite actors) is actually quite good in his role as the reporter who works with Crowe to expose the cigarette industry.

All in all, a pretty good double-feature for the money.",1369785600,4,934,4.568862275449102
