8608238,4,B00EPRISLW,"This concert from 1994 is described as having been 'lovingly restored' and upgraded to Blu-ray from pre-HD source material. This has indeed been done and the upgrade is very successful. The picture image is presented in 16:9 format and has been done carefully so that there are no issues with unfortunate cropping of heads etc. The sound is arguably better than that which one would expect from a 1994 stereo CD and this is because of larger file sizes giving greater resolution plus the addition of good surround sound.

The two performances are both excellent and very rewarding. Barenboim has recorded the 'Emperor' concerto many times now and there is even another one available on a recent Blu-ray/DVD with all four of Beethoven's other piano concertos. This is a larger scale performance with more of a nod to the Romantic period. This is not excessive and is unlikely to worry 'period' enthusiasts. It is likely to delight all other viewers for that same reason. Abbado is an attentive and supportive conductor and the orchestra make the most of the opportunities for musical dialogue between each other and the soloist. Barenboim is fully responsive to this individual and corporate partnership. The recording enables the viewer to follow this with ease but without being visually invasive.

The Brahms second symphony is a fine performance and it is worth mentioning at this point that Abbado's survey of the four Brahms' symphonies on CD with the BPO from much the same period is considered to be one of the most successful of recent times. That easy rapport is evident throughout this performance. By this time Abbado had developed his own style of music making with the orchestra and this is a very different proposition to the one previously associated with this orchestra under Karajan beforehand. It is a tribute to the members of the orchestra that such a change of emphasis had been achieved so apparently seamlessly. This is a fine performance and owners of Abbado's CD version will be delighted with the result and will enjoy the extra spaciousness and depth of the DTS surround sound as well as the advantage of seeing a fine interpretation unfold and develop before their eyes.

This then is a notably successful disc indeed especially when considered on a purely musical basis as the music making is of high order throughout. As a video recording it is still probably advisable to consider that is archive material even though there is a noticeable improvement in the technical aspects of this 1994 recording over the companion 1991 and 1992 concert discs. The following 1995 concert delivers a marked improvement in imaging quality and sharpness and clearly illustrates the rapid advances then being made at this stage in video recording quality. Purchasers need to bear these technical considerations in mind particularly if they are expecting modern HD quality otherwise they may be disappointed.

However this blu-ray version of the 1994 concert offers a significant upgrade from the previous DVD version and collectors will no doubt be keen for Euroarts to add further titles to this venture.",1381190400,3,3119,5.038759689922481
