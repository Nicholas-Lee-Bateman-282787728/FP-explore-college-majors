8441341,5,B004U9TJ86,"It's one thing to read books on watercolor and another to actually watch an expert, practicing artist create a WC painting.  Mr. Taylor demonstrates how to paint 3 buildings by using his simple approach. Simple approach--excellent results!  He makes painting buildings look so easy!  He emphasizes: structure of buildings, simple perspective drawing, and use of color. There's much to learn in this DVD and it is worth watching again and again.  For me, the most important thing I learned was the approach to going from a white sheet of paper to a finished WC painting.  Be advised---in the U.S.A., you will have to watch the DVD on your computer screen because of the European formatting of the DVD.",1390348800,,700,4.898305084745763
