3841503,4,B0021TVYQM,"This DVD is worth the price for the seven-game series between the Penguins and Capitals alone, in which undoubtedly the world's three best players lit up the scoreboard and fought to the bitter end. But there is much more here. The Penguins stood in tenth place just weeks before the playoffs began, and stood above all other teams when the Detroit series ended. THe Penguins play up-tempo hockey, so these highlights are very exciting for any hockey fan. It is not simply a showcase of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin.

In addition, the first round battle between the Penguins and rival Flyers was also a great series, albeit six games and not seven. There were comebacks, individual heroics, players fighting through injuries, and average players becoming heroes. This is akin to the New York Giants' championship over New England in the 2007 Super Bowl. If you are a sports fanatic who likes to get excited, there are plenty of moments here that will have you on the edge of your seat!",1247011200,2,988,4.777777777777778
3841504,3,B0021TVYQM,"Being a Pens fan I was looking forward to the release of the season highlight video. Although all Pens fans will enjoy watching the DVD, the production was poor. Audio mixing was downright awful.  There was plenty of good local TV video available that would have made a much better presentation for the segments in the DVD.  It appeared as though Warner Brothers may have wanted this to look like a DVD made with film not video tape by slowing the frame rate down.  The video quality was mediocre, however.  If you are looking for something you would expect from NFL films, you will be disapppointed.
Nonetheless, for Pens fans it will be enjoyable. Too bad the NHL does not have a better deal with someone other than Warner that could have done a much better job of presenting a great and memorable season.",1246924800,20,807,4.583333333333333
3841505,5,B0021TVYQM,"I'm not really sure what will be on the DVD, but I do speak from the perspective of a diehard hockey fan who watched the entire Stanley Cup Championship Series.  This year's was one of the best series ever, at least in my lifetime.  The Pittsburgh Penguins and the Detroit Red Wings would battle for the Cup for the second straight year.  After the home team won the first 6 games, we were left with a rare game 7 for the Finals (Only the 15th ever).  The odds were clearly stacked against the Penguins.  Only on 2 occasions had a road team won a game 7 in the finals (last was Montreal in 1971 at Chicago), Detroit was the defending champs and looked like the better team most of the series, they were at home where they had only lost once in the playoffs, and back in February, the Penguins were in 10th place and looked like they wouldn't even make the playoffs.  They fired their coach and hired their minor-league affiliate's coach (with no NHL coaching experience).  Pittsburgh defied the odds and defeated Detroit in a thrilling 2-1 win and the Cup.  With their star player, Sidney Crosby injured in the second period, the Penguins won with outstanding goaltending by Marc Andre-Fleury and timely goals by an unlikely hero, Maxime Talbot.  I assume this DVD will have highlights of all of the Finals games, along with interviews and the trophy presentation.  One can hope that they will have game 7 in its entirety on this edition.  The celebration should be included as well.  Highly recommended for all Pittsburgh Penguins fans (like myself) and anyone who is riveted by great hockey with stars, great goaltending and nail-biting finishes.",1245628800,12,1648,4.684027777777778
3841506,2,B0021TVYQM,I purchased this to send to my brother in Australia thinking that it contained all 7 games of the Stanley Cup 2009 against the Red Wings.  It doesn't.,1273190400,3,150,4.357142857142857
3841507,1,B0021TVYQM,"My mom, sister and I were really looking forward to this dvd after such a great, roller coaster ride of a playoff run. However, the dvd seemed to be thrown together. The sound is dreadful. The music is so loud and obnoxious, you can barely hear the players and staff during the interviews (which I thought could've been done better, as well). It didn't capture the emotion of the playoffs and key moments like the crowd chanting Fleury's name before game six of the finals against Detroit were left out completely.

The parade footage looked like they set up a camera and walked away. There was no sound and no commentary. I know, from watching a local Pittsburgh channel online, that there was a spot for TV crews and there was a lot going on there. I think you can actually see the area from the spot where the abandoned camera was rolling for this dvd.

It's like someone who doesn't even watch hockey made this dvd. I recommend skipping this dud and try to find another one about the 2008-09 Pens. If you have any of the playoffs recorded, go back and rewatch them, it'll be more entertaining.",1265673600,8,1097,4.507537688442211
3841508,4,B0021TVYQM,"I read the reviews prior to asking for this DVD for Christmas 2009 :----)
Maybe its actually seeing the DVD 6 months after the season, that allows the joy of this dvd to bring back my memory! Although I agree with previous reviews. But giving the Pens fans more kudos, trying to explain the Penguin comeback season of 2009, firing of the head coach 2 months into season, losing key players in the off season, pens fans still reeling from getting crushed in the 2008 Stanley Cup Championship by the same Red Devils whom we wrestled it from in 2009, is a very difficult thing to present on one single short DVD. Personally I thought this captured the bulk of the season and the difficulties experienced by the Pittsburgh Penguins our 2009 Stanley Cup Champions!! Who can forget the last 6 seconds of game 7! Seemed like 10 minutes/forever to me! 3 shots on goal!
Congrats to our goalie Flurey who saved us in those moments! OMG, I don't think I breathed till I saw the pens raise their arms in victory! I thought the DVD captured those moments well!!
Its a must have DVD for any Pittsburgh Penguin fan (light years better than the Pittsburgh Steelers 2009 Super Bowl DVD!)
cheers and somebody please save our Pittsburgh Pirates!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3841509,3,B0021TVYQM,"The hockey part is good, with interesting interviews and so on... But the shot of the parade is amazingly amateur, incredibly lousy... taken from some guy lost somewhere in the audience, shooting anything, anywhere... NHL is too poor to pay for a REAL official crew to film it and edit it professionally? looks like it... You often see guys going to ANOTHER camera for interviews and stuff.... who the hell was that? Why couldn't they get official film for this? Obviously betmann is too preoccupied making profits on loser teams in the US to make it worth the fans while... Hopefully, there will be a full series release like they had for the Ducks a couple of years ago, or Detroit, or the Rangers (man, they had the whole conference finals AND the SC Finals...). Skip that ""bonus material... it's crap, except perhaps for the celebration's interview... that parade... well, I've probably done better myself at Disneyland!",1259107200,2,924,4.89171974522293
3841510,4,B0021TVYQM,"This is a great highlight reel, but I agree with other reviews in that the audio is really uneven (music too loud in places). Plus the stories from the playoffs feel like they were barely touched on (no mention of Carcillo getting suspended; no mention of Ovechkin injuring Gonchar, etc). Where's the extended dvd? Game 7 was probably one of the most exciting games I've ever seen. If there isn't an extended dvd, they're going to have to have a volume two for the 10 greatest Penguin games!",1257638400,,491,4.590909090909091
3841511,4,B0021TVYQM,"I have been waiting 16 years for the Pens to carry the Stanley Cup again. I remember when Mario Lemieux held the cup back in 92'... what a feeling. I didn't think I would have to wait this long to see someone in the Penguins jersey do it again. Too bad couldn't see Jaromir Jagr as captain winning the Stanley Cup.

Anyway, as for the DVD. I had to buy it because of all the years of waiting. I can't say that it's a DVD that I will keep on watching... the only missing factor to making this an excellent DVD - ACTUAL FOOTAGE OF THE GAME! That's the only thing that was missing. They should of at least added the 3rd period of the actual game on in the extras section. What a pity.

I initially gave this DVD 3 Stars, but decided it should get 4 Stars just because of a very minor segment of the DVD - when Mario Lemieux texted the team giving them all a jolt of motivation to continue fighting. Mario is not just an awesome player but a great owner/manager for the Penguin franchise.",1254700800,,984,4.146596858638744
3841512,5,B0021TVYQM,My family and I have watched this DVD over and over. It is a must for any Pens fan!,1249689600,,83,3.4210526315789473
3841513,5,B0021TVYQM,"This championship season for the Pittsburgh Penguins began on June 4, 2008 when a younger Penguins team lost in the finals to the Detroit Red Wings.  So the 2008-2009 season was considered by most fans a season of unfinished business.

Losing Hossa and Malone was difficult, but the Penguins got through and signed Miroslav Satan and Ruslan Fedotenko.  At one point during the season, Michel Therrien was fired and replaced by Dan Bylsma.  No rookie coach since 1971 had ever won the Stanley Cup before Bylsma did it.

Along the way, we landed Chris Kunitz and Bill Guerin in trades.  Gonchar returned from an injury that kept him out for most of the season.

I remember watching game 7 of the finals and muting the TV to listen to Mike Lange.  What an amazing Cup-saving stop by Fleury!  What an unbelievable feeling to bring the Cup back to Pittsburgh!

As Mike Lange would say, Lord Stanley, Lord Stanley, get me the brandy!",1248566400,2,927,4.666666666666667
3841514,3,B0021TVYQM,"With so much potential to highlight the Pens Stanley Cup championship, I'm disappointed in finding the content in this DVD less than satisfying. Granted, it's the usual mix of stuff found in other championship produced DVD's. I was just hoping, as a fan, to get a little more than the standard flair, especially considering that the last time Pittsburgh won the Stanley Cup was in 1992 - maybe the whole Game 7 as a wonderful reminder, just to start?

Instead, what we get is a somewhat barebones, college produced rehash containing weak commentary and spotty highlights. From the menu page to the joke of additional footage, the half-hearted attempt at quality makes me wonder the rush job effort to put this out for a quick dollar.

Yet, as sad as it is more care wasn't taken in organizing a worthy video montage, ultimately, one has to overlook the slim content and just simply appreciate it for what was done - the Pens won it all - that alone should be a momento in itself.",1247356800,,979,4.620689655172414
3841515,3,B0021TVYQM,"The makings for a great documentary were made by the Penguins, so it is disappointing that the producer of this DVD failed to tell the story adequately.

There are some glaring omissions.  First, the byline created by Hossa's departure/defection was barely touched.  The details should have been brought forth with historic accuracy.  Second, there was no sign of the huge overflowing crowds of fans that surrounded the overflow ""Igloo"" to watch the games on a jumbotron.  Third, after the devastating loss in Game Five, there was no mention that when the next game returned to the Burgh, the crowd was shouting pregame:  ""Fleury!!  Fleury!!!""  And no effort to detail how our goalie had been (wrongly and unfairly) criticized and doubted throughout the playoffs, and how he responded in the next games.  Fourth, the actual video is so brief as to lack any real context.  No segment was even long enough to show the development of a play.  Just a few seconds that show the final shot.  Fifth, there were additional story lines for many individual players, in addition to the Big Guns, that were never touched.  Finally, the ""extra features"", so good on many DVD's, are a real disappointment.

All that said, the DVD does carry some of the excitement of this season and play-off run.  It's just too bad the producer was not from the Burgh.",1247184000,6,1338,4.832599118942731
8349491,1,B0021TVYQM,"Thankfully, I watched a friend's dvd and didn't buy my own. If you notice, most of the positive reviews on here say nothing about the specifics of the DVD. I can't believe one reviewer even compared this to the NFL Films production of the Steelers Super Bowl video. NFL Films have never let me down. This was a piece of crap.

I echo what has already been said by the negative reviewers. Sound mixing was horrible. The details and storyline lacked significant detail. A large chunk of the video was the stupid parade. Definitely a let down after some of the good stuff you can find on YouTube about the early 90's Cup wins.",1465776000,,623,4.464912280701754
