8298395,5,B000XX61R0,"A much appreciated release from our friends in South Korea.

Unfortunately, not everyone can afford the high prices Criterion charges for their releases, however, I would hardly refer to purchasing this So. Korean release as merely ""settling"".  -  The picture and sound quality are great.  And the DVDs are much more affordable.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I would not hesitate for a moment to give this as a gift.  (And I've had the opportunity to view the Criterion release.)  This is a far cry from a ""cheap knock-off copy"".

Those of you who are not impressed by ""Brand Names"" will be more than satisfied with this South Korean import release.

Side Note: Sometimes the Manufacturers set Korean Subtitles as the Default.  They are easily Removable.  (This, coming from an Electronics illiterate person) ;)  If it's easy for me, it'll be a piece of cake for those of you who are Electronically Savvy. :)
