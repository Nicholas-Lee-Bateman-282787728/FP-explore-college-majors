8524209,4,B00829GFNC,"Great set.  Bruno is vibrant reading Glenn's scripts. The discussions are crackling, quintessential Gould.  The playing is mesmerizing.  The sound quality is 7 out of ten:  decent stereo, some distortion, but only what a purist would hear.  One for the ages.

Keep scanning for price -- it dips dramatically once in a while.  If you love Gould and enjoy hearing him intone and, mostly, play, then just get this.",1415059200,2,411,4.869565217391305
8524210,3,B00829GFNC,"Just as Gone With the Wind must be in every DVD collection, whether one particularly cares for the movie or not ... so must this be in every video collection of classical music, and particularly in the possession of every pianist.  This in spite of the fact that it's extremely difficult to watch.

I am referring of course only to the Goldberg Variations release.  The other two disks (Question of Instrument, and An Art of Fugue) are far less problematic, in fact they are enjoyable, 5-star material.  They were recorded some years earlier, when Mr. Gould was in good health, body and mind.  Sure, he had his eccentricities from the very beginning.  However, I question whether his reputation is enhanced by this 1981 recording of the Goldbergs, made shortly before he passed.  He is obviously unwell, and although he must have consented to being paraded before the voyeuristic public, I do not think that necessarily makes it right.  In my opinion, it is simply exploitation of the handicapped in the financial interests of somebody else, in this case the recording industry.  Of course, I may be wrong, and I probably am wrong.  However, I am afraid the chief selling attraction here is Mr. Gould's extreme appearance and mannerisms, not his musicianship which can be appreciated on an audio recording.

Now that that is out of the way, since the video must be had, best to get it now.  It has gone for $30 and more since the earliest days of VHS.  Now suddenly it is down to $16.28 + shipping, which includes two additional disks that are certainly worth seeing, as mentioned.

So yes, of course, get it.  Just watch the earlier two disks first.

P.S.  Happy 329th birthday today, J.S. Bach!",1395360000,4,1696,4.7534246575342465

Essentially, this is a spoken dialogue piece where various voices interact and weave in and out of one another through the magic of studio editing. Gould is seen with Bruno Monsaingeon in the studio - the music playing in the background - while he amusingly conducts the spoken voices as they overlap and at times interact in the manner of a subject or countersubject in a fugue. His depth of understanding and commitment to fugal procedure is also seen in his humorous 4-part vocal composition, ""So You Want To Write A Fugue?"" while his demonstration of how the piano is capable in expressing music that is less instrument-specific, is revealed in his solo piano adaptation of Carl Ruggles' ""Angels"" (from ""Men and Angels"") - originally scored for six muted trumpets. This transcription was performed in concert by Gould which he describes in the present set on, ""The Question Of Instrument"".

In this 3 DVD set, Gould's main thesis (in both playing and discussion) seems to be that Bach was fundamentally a structure-first composer rather than a generally sonority-specific one, who drew elements from the past and present to produce far reaching musical results. This gave the music a suggestiveness and versatility that allowed it to be adapted to various musical idioms.

These 3 extraordinary films explore the music of Bach in performance and with discussion of some key issues related to Bach the composer, and of playing his music on the modern piano. It helps that Gould is one of the most articulate speakers on music among pianists (Andrs Schiff has been  another fine spokesman for Bach and Beethoven) and from a contextual standpoint, that he is familiar with the musical repertoire prior to Bach's time. After playing the early B.A.C.H. Fugue (which begins ""An Art of the Fugue""), Gould goes on to relay how Bach developed his tremendous potential from humble beginnings and took time to hone his fugal craft into the masterworks we know in works such as the WTC, Art of Fugue and Partitas.

First and foremost, there is an actively engaged, superior musical mind at work here - applying itself in a very real, contemporary way to the music at hand. Gould impresses by the flexibility of his approach which unfortunately his recordings do not fully convey. When questioned by Mr. Monsaingeon on a tempo used for a particular fugue in the WTC, Gould replies by saying how flexible he is on tempo matters and proceeds to demonstrate a quite different rendition at twice the speed. In so doing, he releases Bach from the straitjacket that others have applied to his music. This is not to say that Gould is compromising in terms of Bach being first and foremost a structural composer. In fact, Gould's playing never suggests sentimentality or an approach which some might sympathetically say, ""humanizes"" the music. For Gould, Bach's music contains nothing to be apologetic for and sensualizing its exterior was simply not a priority for him. Accordingly, Gould's playing of Bach's works here does prioritize in the manner of a composer's by firstly clarifying musical architecture, which is accomplished with a very personalized concentration, a trademark clarity of counterpoint and a highly developed digital and rhythmic control and co-ordination. The listener is to be involved by being equally immersed in the work and in that way is a part of the creative process. Gould's idea is that, contrary to the Romantic emphasis on individual identity, the composer, interpreter and listener should once again be in a state of artistic unity. The irony is that it is Gould's strong individual artistic personality that draws or repels people to or away from him. What he demands from us as listeners is that we approach the music as more informed, actively focused participants and that our satisfaction is ultimately attained through a better understanding of the fundamental nature of a composition.

It is great to have Gould's 1981 studio performance of the Goldberg Variations available again on the domestic US market. Much has already been said about this performance (made on a Yamaha grand piano) with comparisons made to the famous 1955 reading. Gould's interview before the performance elucidates how the need for a better rhythmic design or pulse that went through the entire work and which related to the theme, as well as the advent of stereo and dolby technology, compelled him to re-record the piece. In fact, Gould was one of the few Classical pianists who absolutely needed the next step in technology to propel himself to the next level. There is a scene in the ""The Alchemist"" DVD where he is focused on the editing process and laments that ""they"" hadn't yet worked out how to make a 75 minute record. If any pianist needed CD technology in 1974, it was Glenn Gould. There is an unforgettable scene in that film where Gould is in the studio after a multi-track recording of Scriabin's Prelude, ""Desir"" - evidently a new procedure. Gould is actually conducting the mixing engineer! This, while ecstatically instructing him to bring down this slider or bring that one up on the mixing board in order to produce the right kind of musical effect at the right moment with the mystical Russian composer's music.

The films, ""The Question Of Instrument"" (1979) and ""An Art Of The Fugue"" (1980) are two-thirds of the ""Glenn Gould Plays Bach"" trilogy. The first film is centered on a complete performance of the Partita No. 4 in D major but also includes the Art of Fugue Contrapunctus I and Chromatic Fantasy (in 2 parts) while the second film focuses on the Art of Fugue Contrapunctus II, IV, and culminates in the unfinished Contrapunctus XV. There are also performances from the WTC2 - the E major and Bb minor Fugues and A major Prelude and Fugue. Highlights include the Allemande and Sarabande from the D major Partita (the Sarabande features some interesting variations in articulation and registration in the repeats which is not a feature of his earlier audio recording of the work), the sublime E major fugue mentioned and the Art of Fugue excerpts which are truly extraordinary. Discussions on the E major and Bb minor fugues from the WTC2 and the Art of Fugue are particularly insightful. The banter with Monsaingeon is effectively staged - mostly revealing Gould's unique thoughts and references to a wide variety of music. The Art of Fugue is observed to reach back to the North German Franco-Flemish composers at times while at others, suggesting the far-reaching chromaticism of late Wagner or early Schoenberg.

There are certainly entertaining aspects to this release - Gould's opinionated references to the ""Scarlatti-syndrome"" or Beethoven's 7th Symphony as ""anticipating disco music"", his imitation of scat singing, mocking the harmonically rambling Chromatic Fantasy or middle period Beethoven, and especially the nerdy duo of Gould and Monsaigneon singing a Bach Trio sonata together. The only complaint for 3 these DVDs - each less than an hour long - is the lack of any bonus features. Beyond that, are three enlightening and sympathetically produced films by Bruno Monsaingeon which allow this wizard of a musician to be his quirky self as he shares Bach's music - music which he clearly loved and profoundly comprehended.

It is a memorable experience to be eavesdropping on music making by Glenn Gould (1932-1982) at a creative summit in this final phase. Personally, I am not drawn to the cult of this musician's artistic personality, yet as I am only more awed by Bach's gift of music to the world, I can do nothing but thoroughly recommend this release.",1351728000,32,8077,5.217257318952234
