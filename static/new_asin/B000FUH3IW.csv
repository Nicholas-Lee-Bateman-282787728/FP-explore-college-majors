Sex Taxi is a trilogy featuring a deranged/misogynistic driver in his exploits to blackmail or kidnap a variety of young girls and women all around town that are nave enough to ride his taxi.  As you can imagine (if you have THAT kind of imagination), it features all but the most extreme kink involving every stereotype of anime female from 18+ high schoolgirls to housewives, without any consequence to the antagonist male.  You can enjoy it for its visuals; you can thrill at the injustice; if you enjoy both - what kind of person are you?!

As exploitative as it is, its pretty generic.  The average viewer will no doubt be repulsed by extortion reasoning behind the driver's motive, no doubt the ""non-average"" viewer will be titillated by the dark fantasy come true that seems to a rising genre within Adult Japanese Animation but the trilogy doesn't really get above any harem-based movie.  For those searching for genuine shock value, check out my reviews other hentai anime that cross into other genres to gross out your friends and alienate any women in your life.",1441584000,,1730,5.070422535211268
