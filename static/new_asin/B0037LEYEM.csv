8390608,1,B0037LEYEM,"This video is a RIPOFF. It has 3 excercises, that all just 3!!!! There is no audio and it is digital, no real humans. The excercises are very basic that you sure do not need a video to show you how to do. Save your money. Look it up on UTUBE for free they will show you the exact same excercises.",1307577600,,296,3.8688524590163933
8390609,4,B0037LEYEM,"This video offers very clear instructions on how to perform some common stretching and strengthening exercises for folks with lower back pain. I got max results by combining this video with a custom exercise routine, designed by my physical therapist, who I visited weekly.  I felt that this video supplemented the PT's instructions when I performed my at-home workouts.  I am not sure how effective the video would be if you used it without a physical therapist's guidance, since I performed a combination of some of the video's exercises, and some others not covered (a lot of work with balance balls, foam rollers, etc.)  Also, I did not perform my workouts with this video. I only used the video for training on correct form, since my PT had custom instructions every week on the number of reps and how long I was supposed to hold all of the positions.  The video is definitely not one of the peppy workout videos that I love when I am healthy.  The video probably would not deliver much benefit if it were used as a standalone rehab program.  But the video is a very valuable supplement to a well-designed custom physical therapy program.",1283644800,,1143,4.71859296482412
8390610,5,B0037LEYEM,"The key to improving treatment outcomes with lower back pain patients is the addition of rehabilitation exercises.  As a chiropractor, I frequently give exercises to stretch and strengthen the lower back muscles.  This DVD is an excellent tool to help with compliance.  The exercises demonstrated are ones that I frequently recommend to my patients and know they work!  Following the easy instructions, visual demonstrations and progression of these exercises will improve how you feel and strengthen a weak back.

8390611,5,B0037LEYEM,"I've been a practising chiropractor for 10 years, and I've been waiting all this time for a tool like this. One of the most frustrating aspects of working with patients is getting them to do their exercises consistently and correctly.  The DVD shows patients exactly how each stretch should be executed in real time. This takes the guesswork out, and increases patience compliance, which increases results. I especially love the way the scheduled increases of difficulty keep the exercises challenging. This is a well produced video that was obviously very well researched.  I love it and my patients love it.  I would recommend it without any reservations.",1272153600,,657,5.121495327102804
8390612,5,B0037LEYEM,"As a chiropractor that is genuinely concerned with my patients health and well-being, finding a rehab product to take the place of my instruction has been extremely difficult.  The Video Rehab Solutions video for back pain and stabilization are PHENOMENAL.  They are easy to follow, but complete, legitimate exercises that Ive been recommending to my patients for years.  Instead of having to continuously show my patients the same exercises over and over, I can hand them a DVD that they can take home with them - and they are customized to our office!  It has saved me time, its saved my patients money, and the results will speak for themselves.  I highly recommend this product ... but only if you want results.
