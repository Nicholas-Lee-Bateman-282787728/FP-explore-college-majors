This movie inspired me to become a high school janitor and teach martial arts to kids in the evening. This movie is well worth the wait that it takes to ship, took over a month and a half. This movie definitely gets two thumb snaps and twist. Love it.",1297296000,,331,4.26984126984127

531088,3,6303003990,"It's my opinion that director Robert Radler's first film, the aptly named&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-the-Best/dp/B0002O7XUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of the Best</a>, was a fluke. Following that rather classy production, he's kept himself estranged from respectable drama and successfully strove for a career in martial arts B-movies and ""Power Rangers"" episodes. To differentiate himself from the filmmakers of similar credentials, he directed one of the most blatant knock-offs of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Karate-Kid/dp/B0008JIJ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Karate Kid</a>&nbsp;I've ever seen and therein created a mini-classic for fans of Billy Blanks and a sturdy vehicle for ex-Ninja Turtle Kenn Scott. It's a little light on actual hand-to-hand action, but for what it's worth, interest in either of the two aforementioned stars is reason enough to try and find this one at a reasonable price.

Replacing Ralph Macchio is Kenn Scott (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-II/dp/B0000696I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II</a>) as Ken Marx, a high school senior transferring to the west coast from Kansas. Replacing William Zabka is Ken McLeod (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadly-Target/dp/B000EWBO7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadly Target</a>) as Tom, the karate-practicing school bully who beats on Ken for getting the hots for his girlfriend Julie (Christine Taylor of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wedding-Singer/dp/0780622588/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wedding Singer</a>, replacing Elisabeth Shue). Coming to his aid as the butt-kicking janitor/ex-cop is Billy Blanks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tough-and-Deadly/dp/B0000A08LF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tough and Deadly</a>), replacing Pat Morita, who trains him in self-defense - opposite of Martin Kove-wannabe Patrick Kilpatrick (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B00005JL78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minority Report</a>) as Tom's sadistic Sensei Lee, whose vendetta against Billy could turn a matter of schoolyard pride into a deadly confrontation.

True to its roots, ""Showdown"" is less of a fight movie than a coming-age-tale with liberal amounts of karate tossed in. There are only about three actual matches amongst a peppering of one-sided beatings, form-striking, and training scenes. While personally disappointed at the inabundance of genuine fisticuffs, I have to admit that most of what you see is pretty pleasing: with the exception of Kilpatrick, the entire kicking cast - also including Nicholas Hill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport-2/dp/B00005MM61/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport 2</a>) and James Lew (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balance-of-Power/dp/6304371128/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balance of Power</a>) - is composed of real-life martial artists whose competence shows through the choreography. While it's not the best stuff that Billy Blanks ever did, it makes a strong argument for Kenn Scott deserving action hero status of his own, since he's more than capable of kicking butt and looking good while he does it.

The entire high school setting comes alive effectively, with the exception that several of the students look/are several seasons beyond their senior year. The acting is fairly hammy but within the acceptable range for a movie like this, with the only lackluster performance coming from Blanks himself. Though this one had to endure a direct-to-video release, its production values aren't lacking at all and, yes, the mandatory '80s pop/rock song is in place during the training scenes. The ""like-'Karate Kid'-but-more-intense"" premise is pushed to the brink, but it pales in comparison to its inspirational material in getting its message across: the original film was corny but relevant to issues kids go through, whereas this one's attempt to kick its life lesson into overdrive resulted in a movie that has ties to modern life but more so seems to exist in a world of its own. This makes for an arguably cooler movie but nullifies the emotional impact I wish it could have retained.

It'd be great if I could judge ""Showdown"" as its own adventure, but when almost every scene is practically testifying to what it's ripping off, it's impossible not to make the comparison.  Really know yourself before you spend the extra dough that copies of the film go for these days: does a reduced amount of fighting bother you, do corny B-movies bug you, and are you a fanboy of ""The Karate Kid""?",1264723200,3,4892,6.7958532695374805
531089,5,6303003990,"I ordered this movie for my fiance, because he had been looking for it everywhere, and wasn't in stores anymore.  He loved that it took only 10 days from when I ordered it 'til it got to my house!",1225497600,,196,4.0256410256410255
531090,4,6303003990,"Although a serious rip-off of Karate Kid, Showdown is really a very good B movie, perhaps one of the best I have ever seen that is enjoyable from all standpoints.

Unlike the Karate Kid, which is rated PG, Showdown is PG-13 (info says its R, but its really PG-13), resulting in a darker and tougher movie with much better fighting.  The story is very similar to that of Karate Kid, right down to a janitor (Billy Blanks) teaching a new kid at school (Ken Scott) how to defend himself from a much more skilled bully (Ken Mcleod).  Sound familiar? Patrick Kilpatrick does quite the overacting job playing the bad guy Sensai and Christine Taylor (one of the more famous actors) plays the bully's girl.  Good acting from most of these people, even Billy Blanks does a better job than his usual self.  The script is good and the story keeps you engaged, and there is even some comic relief filled in.

The action is well done, and used in all the right places throughout the story.  The best scenes are near the end.  The first very good fight scene is between Billy Blanks and James Lew (Balance of Power, Perfect Weapon) in the school theatre.  Awesome fight that compares itself in quality to most martial art movie final fight scenes.  As for Showdown's final fight, there are actually 2 back-to-back.  The first is Ken (Ken Scott) against Tom (Ken Mcleod) in Sensai Lee's dojo.  An illegal fight setup in front of screaming fans and lasts a good 5 minutes.  Finally, though not as good as a fight, is Lee vs Billy (Billy Blanks) in a 2 minute Showdown.

Great movie, though Karate Kid is written all over this, so it had help.  Nevertheless, this version is a bit harder and darker, so if you want a good karate Kid film with more of an edge, Showdown is perfect.",1177113600,10,1763,4.5

531092,3,6303003990,"I'll start by saying that this is basically a knock off of the successful 80's smash ""Karate Kid"" (Pat Morita, Ralph Machio). However I found myself having a little more sympathy for the main actor (kid) in this one. Billy blanks is no Harrison Ford but, considering his backround, doesn't do all that bad. The main dissapointments(or hillariously funny aspects, depending on your perspective) were the supporting characters. The girlfriend was shallow, the antogonist kid - totally unthreatening, and the main villain-Lee so hastily put togather you'd swear only half his makeup was on. Most of the supporting characters have about the same artistic license and depth as the cast of any of Troma productions' films. Rent before you buy.",1027900800,4,737,5.15

It's a great movie with a great message. :)

From IMDB:

Ken has just moved from Kansas with his mother. He talks to a girl named Julie, not knowing that her boyfriend Tom is very possessive of her. Tom is learning karate from Lee, a sensei whose brother was killed by a rookie cop named Billy. Billy has since then become the janitor of the school that Ken, Julie and Tom go to.

When Ken gets beaten up by Tom for talking to Julie again, Billy helps Ken by teaching him how to defend himself, which eventually leads to a battle between student vs. student, and sensei vs. sensei.  Written by JoshForman@aol.com",1352332800,,931,4.2727272727272725

That being said, even if you love the karate kid, you probably won't like this movie. It has none of the charm, isn't heartwarming at all, none of the characters are likable. If you are feeling tempted to watch this film, just watch the karate kid instead. 2 stars only because I love 80s kitsch .. but this movie really barely deserves even 1.",1518220800,,476,4.359550561797753
