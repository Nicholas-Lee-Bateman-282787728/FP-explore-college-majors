8713757,2,B00WLOXV8Q,"There were probably 2 movies out of six that were decent, but overall it was bad acting and cheesy music. The only movies I liked were ""Another Woman"" and ""Diamond Girl"". In one of the movies (At the Midnight Hour), you can tell the actress did not want to kiss the actor and looked disgusted while doing so. Almost all the male characters in each movie came off very unlikable because they had a rich, snobby persona rather than the alpha male persona they were trying to convey. I only paid 5 bucks for this at Walmart so it's not a huge loss. FYI: The movies were made between 1994 - 1998, there may be one that was made in 2001. The cover makes it seem like they were recently made movies and they're not.",1440115200,2,709,4.2592592592592595
