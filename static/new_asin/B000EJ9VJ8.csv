8110636,5,B000EJ9VJ8,"The cover art and description being boring and nondescript, I didn't expect much from this one. However I was more than pleasantly surprised to find a witty, imaginative and twisted dark comedy reminiscent of the films of Jan Wook Park. Every country excels in at least one area. Korea's specialty is twisted revenge movies. I have seen thousands of films from all over the world and very few have made any kind of impression on me. This movie did. I have high hopes for Mu-Yeong Lee. I think he could eventually rival Takashi Miike, Jan Wook Park, and Beat Takashi in quality and originality.",1164844800,4,593,4.711538461538462
