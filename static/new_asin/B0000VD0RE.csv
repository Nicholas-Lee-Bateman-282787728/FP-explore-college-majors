It took a couple of weeks to watch when I did it had a Bella Lugosi collection. The case was correct but the DVD was wrong. Returned to Amazon quick and easy for a replacement thinking it was one time mistake at the factory. But when I received the second one, WRONG, it had the same Bella collection in it. Return to Amazon for refund.

On a side note, the Bella colection was pretty good, quality on a couple movies were fair, but since they are 60+ years old I won't complain.

8003577,4,B0000VD0RE,"First, these movies are not re-mastered or digitalized and the quilaity is less than exceptional, however, they are unedited for context and are three classic horror movies you can enjoy the way audiences enjoyed them at their premere.  Night of the living Dead, a true materpiece of cinamatic horror and the first of its kind which spawned a never ending string of flesh eating zombie movies.  The acting, directing, backdrops and everything you can ever want in a edge of your seat movie is all wrapped up very nicely in this one.  This is indeed a cult classic, the Carnival of Souls is much more of a thrill a minute type movie, much like the Alferd Hitcock brand, a suspenseful movie with a lot of twists and turns which beings rather slowly and builds up a lot of momentum, the acting is great and the direction is inspiring.  The Satanic Rites of Dracula is a Hammer Production and the least enjoyable of the three, a pretty straight forward Dracula movie starring Chirstopher Lee as the never ending Count Dracula and Peter Cushing as the son of the son of the son of Van Helsing.  This movie does not have the appeal other Dracula movies Hammer produced and falls a bit short of the mark.  Still for the price you cannot go wrong with this collection.",1271548800,2,1260,4.5777777777777775
