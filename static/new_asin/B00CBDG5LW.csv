5711206,2,B00CBDG5LW,"I really tried my best to like this movie. I understand where they were going with it but the long moments of silence was irritating. I understand they were creating a mood but Lord Jesus! TALK. There were several times when they spoke and no translations was shown. It was only $1.99 so I guess I got my money's worth. Classic spoiled brat dating ""powerful"" rich, married man who obviously don't understand the rules. If he cant give you want you need then let go and move on. Lover turn obsessed nutt job only for the remainder of your life to be lived in regret.",1429228800,2,565,4.390476190476191
5711207,3,B00CBDG5LW,Movie is fair but I would not have purchased it had I been able to preview the movie prior to purchasing it.,1401235200,,108,3.9545454545454546
5711208,1,B00CBDG5LW,I will not acknowledge this film by writing a review. It is nothing but a waste of celluloid and your money.,1389052800,,108,4.190476190476191
5711209,2,B00CBDG5LW,I don't have much to say about this movie.  I can say that it bored me so much that I was looking forward to it just being over.,1382140800,3,128,3.5714285714285716
5711210,5,B00CBDG5LW,"This is a love story in the vein of one of Shakespear's finest love dramas.  These two lovers are there own worst enemies, and yet they are bound together by a love/hate relationship that in the end will destroy one and leave the other a grieving and self-hating emotional wreck.  This is the product of love.  This is not the all-caring ties of love, but the pure self-destruction of emotions that can only cause total physical harm--death.  LOVE CAN BE EXTREMELY HAZZARDOUS TO ONES HEALTH!  NJMJr!",1377993600,5,499,4.755813953488372

5711212,3,B00CBDG5LW,"My best translation from watching this movie: ""hoping against hope""-- ""esperando desesperando"". Esperando also means ""waiting"" by one definition. The movie reached its goal of portraying this. It happens. Not much dialogue, but heavy on atmosphere. Need to find the mood/state to view this movie. Three stars for me.",1464739200,,316,5.469387755102041
5711213,1,B00CBDG5LW,"An absolutely terrible movie. Poor acting, writing, directing, lighting. Nothing to like about this dull, lifeless movie. That is 75 minutes of my life I will never get back.",1464220800,,174,5.0344827586206895

5711217,1,B00CBDG5LW,The picture summary tells more about the movie than is even hinted at online. Whole thing was a muddied mess. The two behave more like long lost enemies than lovers. Save you time for more worthwhile narratives.,1459209600,,211,4.72972972972973
