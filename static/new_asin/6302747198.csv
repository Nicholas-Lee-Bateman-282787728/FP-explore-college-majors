504707,5,6302747198,I love this movie. Why? The music was fantastic. Victorio Gasman and John Ericson were gorgeous. I love that they play the instruments as if they know how to play them. And Liz's beauty was unreal. Anyway I am crazy for Liz's movies from the 40's and 50's except Cat on the Hot Thin Roof and Butterfield 8 which I could not stand.,1092700800,8,330,4.253968253968254
504708,2,6302747198,"This movie is standard 1950's soap.  What makes it worth a look are two factors; the splendid classical music (though I agree with one of the other reviewers that there were too many reaction shots) and the beauty of the young Elizabeth Taylor, as annoying as her character might be.",1079222400,6,283,4.66
504709,2,6302747198,"I've seen this movie many times. Its definitely a 'period' piece, Liz at her most shallow and vacuous. Obviously, her sole purpose in this movie is to pose, and lounge languidly against some really awful furniture. With that in mind, I'd have to say that some of my fellow reviewers here have been overly-harsh on the movie, and some way too gracious. It is not a great film. For one thing, the scenery, for the most part, is fake. Some of the driving scenes, and the conversations, particularly the ones held 'outside', are hilarious, since they are so obviously held against fake backgrounds. If there are real scenes shot outside, and dare I say it, 'on location' - they are very few in number. Looks like stock footage and backlot shots, to me. The music, on the other hand, is amazing. Now I'm speaking as a (former) violinist, and orchestra member. Even though I know they somehow faked the playing of the soloists (both piano, and violin), I'm still amazed at how real it looks sometimes, especially during the extended concerto passages. And, I still haven't figured out how they did it, back in those days! I don't pay too much attention to the story - it could have been lifted straight out of an early episode of Peyton Place, so its not even worth the effort to point out its flaws, or the sometimes laughable, 'Carol-Burnett/Harvey Korman-style' dialog. And, if there is any real 'scenery' to rave about, it'd almost HAVE to be a young, violet-eyed Liz, who is stunning, even when she's play shallow and vapid.",1075507200,6,1523,4.686567164179104
504710,5,6302747198,"I plan on buying the VHS of this movie just based on seeing it on cable tv recently.  It is hard to find any work done by actor John Ericson on TV or tape.  I enjoyed his performance overall very much, and especially, his scene in the bar with Vittorio Gassman, and when he plays the piano concerto.  Elizabeth Taylor also, did a commendable job.  The whole cast was well selected and were good in their performances.  I also enjoyed the performance of the actor, don't remember his name, who played the part of Professor Schuman. This is purely a romantic movie, and I being a romantic at heart, loved it.  Beautiful scenery, beautiful classial music and a well assembled cast with good performances are truly worth buying the tape.  I just hope that in the future this movie will be released on DVD. I will be the first in line to purchase it.",1039478400,11,845,4.4480519480519485
504711,3,6302747198,"RHAPSODY IS SPECTACULAR  FOR ITS LOCATIONS AND  LIZ'S WARDROBE.  TWO OF THE MOST HANDSOME MALE ACTORS, VITTORIO GASSMAN & JOHN ERICSON, ARE RARELY SEEN IN AMERICAN MOVIES.  THE MAIN ATTRACTION IS THE MUSIC,  ESPECIALLY THE 2ND PIANO CONCERTO RACHMANINOFF, PLAYED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY A  WONDERFUL ORCHESTRA.  THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE  EXPERIENCED THE DIFFICULTIES OF LOVE.",958262400,10,387,5.229508196721311
504712,4,6302747198,"Rhapsody was a real treat. The music alone is the price of admission. Yes the story is standard soap. Nevertheless, I couldn't help but cheer for Ericson's character to get the girl. Also, please watch for bad jump cut.  It occurrs during the train station scene. Ericson's back is towards  viewer, as he about to pick up his bag, there is a reel change and suddenly  he is standing straight. Now onto the rest of the review. This is a  difficult movie interms of acting. Why? Because during the long musical  performances. We get cutaway after cutaway or reaction shots. I know it was  1954 but couldn't the director have taken us out of the hall and showed us  some cute kids, flowers or dogs or cats?
The presentation of this movie  on cable was shown in it's theatrical aspect ratio. I would say judging by  the black bars, looks like VistaVision. The point is, it didn't help. Would  I buy the picture, of course! I hope it is released via DVD. That's my  opinion.",950400000,5,969,4.48

504854,4,6302747198,"While the story line is a pretty thin and formulaic, one can't help but be attracted to the gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor in her prime. The reason I purchased this DVD was strictly for the music, which is fabulous. If you are NOT a classical music lover, don't buy it. I have never seen a movie, new or old, with so much classical musical content other than operas, as huge segments of piano and violin concertos are offered to the viewer and are the star of the show. I have purchased a copy for musical friends as well, and they were overjoyed to receive it. Bottom line: if classical violin and piano move you, purchase this DVD. If not, stay well away from it as you will be bored silly. Personally, I love it.",1431561600,,710,4.345864661654136

504857,5,6302747198,"I became enraptured by Elizabeth Taylor without reservation from the first moment I saw her in ""National Velvet"" and remained so throughout the seventy years since. I saw ""Rhapsody"" ten years later and re-experienced the heart throbbing connection again...of course...but this time it was wrapped up in two of the most captivating pieces of music the classical venue has ever produced as the backdrop of the mildly ""soapy"" romantic story line.  Despite my ""rapture"", I didn't think of this as a great movie per se...only as the perfect meld of heart and soul and sound and vision I could have imagined. It was decades before I was able to see it for the second time (no DVDs or VCR tapes or Amazons available during those years...you saw a movie when it came to town and that was most likely ""it"" unless you coincidentally intercepted it in a different city shortly after. So, without apologies for my bias, I still think this is an intriguing and thrilling visual and emotional way to spend an hour and a half and come away with a truly lovely memory.",1421366400,,1052,4.686486486486486

504908,5,6302747198,"Although it seems like a rather unknown little film, it is actually quite unique. All three main characters have impressive depth and the relationships are represented in an unusually realistic manner. This film does not follow the usual course of glamorizing love, but rather represents some of the more realistic yet lesser discussed aspects, like questions of personal identity, an inability to be what the other desires, or the question of how one wants to be loved. While the film does not privilege female subjectivity in any way, it is worth seeing as a sort of female character study in relation to love.

At the same time, it is a usual love story in that there is drama, a happy ending and closure. Ultimately, Rhapsody is well worth seeing to anyone interested in the complexity of love.",1403308800,,798,4.824817518248175

504933,5,6302747198,"This movie made me cry. It was the magic of the music. I love classical music and  this film did more to bring back that wonderful music which I heard it did and I am happy for that. The acting was sort of corny in some parts but the wonderful music and the cute little Professor Schumann made up for the rest. Elizabeth was good in this role of Lulu, Louise Durant a rich, spoiled socialite who always got what she wanted until she ran into Bronte who wanted fame and money more than her. I liked her father too. He was great in this wonderful role although somewhat detached at first he did come around in the end to encourage her to stick with James, her husband, and to help him become a great pianist. I think he does play as I found two cds of his piano music on Amazon. Don't know if it is the same man though as Claudio Arrau played all the piano music for this film. I mean he actually recorded these pieces just for this movie. He is one terrific pianist. Check him out on You Tube.

The ending was terrific for the sanctity of marriage. I was surprised that the  screenwriter had her staying with her husband and not running off with Bronte which would have been more like the newer Hollywood films. This was refreshing and should be in more of today's films. But alas our culture is corrupt and at its end. SAD! However this is a good movie that was not given it's full due. I give it a five. Highly recommended!",1381190400,2,1424,4.208791208791209

You have the great violinist whom Liz is so in love with and yet so bad for her emotionally and a potential great pianist who adores her and wants her to participate in all aspect of his life and yet whom does she pine for?!

The story is well done and the music behind it is great. It also gives one an idea how and what concert violinists and pianists have to undergo in their rigorous preparations before performing on the concert stage and how it would affect their personal lives. The story revolves around the choice of another musician (Elizabeth Taylor) between the violinist and the pianist and in finally commiting herself to one of them.

However in the short time it was announced it never was offered by Amazon nor by other sellers and it very quickly disappeared from the Warner Archive series site also. As living in Europe I could never order it from Warner itself because they don't sell the Archive series outside the USA.

505014,4,6302747198,"This movie has always been one of my favorites because it brings me back to my college years (long time ago).  It stars Elizabeth Taylor, Vittorio Gassman and John Ericson , all at their most stunning physically if not artistically.  However, there is not too much to be done with the schmaltzy story about the rich and beautiful young woman who pursues her dashing violinist across Europe only to learn that his violin is more important to him than her company or her money. Meanwhile, her neighbor (Ericson), also a gifted musician (pianist), is yearning for her and happily puts her ahead of his music. Taylor's wealthy father is played effortlessly by Louis Calhern as a sardonic but ultimately caring force in her life (a typical Calhern role). I recommend this film as wonderful escapism and suggest you forget about serious content, lasting significance, etc. and just sit back and enjoy a glamorous if vapid Liz Taylor, a handsome pair of suitors (especially Gassman) and some of the most beautiful music in the world (there are soaring performances, or partial performances,  and background music featuring Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, Rachmaninov's piano concerto and assorted other classical masterpieces).

There is also excellent music and Elizabeth Taylors great beauty at its best to set the scene.  I'ts a pity this is not on DVD.  The ending is REALLY great!!!",1106179200,10,428,4.3924050632911396

7830422,2,6302747198,"Review of Rhapsody
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

The Glenn Miller Story, The Eddy Duchin Story, and Young Chopin are all biopics from the 1950s that show audiences a true story of a famous musicians life. Biopics have always been a popular genre, and in the golden age of musicals, the 1950s produced many true-to-life stories of musicians and singers. Rhapsody is based off of a novel, not real life, so keep that in mind when you watch it.

Vittorio Gassman, who made a big splash in the previous years Glass Ceiling, is placed in the difficult position of having to choose between two passions: the violin and Elizabeth Taylor. Tough decision. In the same Zurich music conservatory, a piano player falls in love with Liz, adding another love triangle to the mix. If you like these types of movies, with lots of classical music in the background and lots of violin and piano playing scenes, youll probably want to add Rhapsody to your list. It doesnt have the same feel as a biopic, and sometimes the love stories get a little tiresome, but its not the worst movie to come out of the decade.",1500422400,,1094,4.576530612244898

7830425,5,6302747198,"Finally got round to purchasing this after having seen (and loved) it on TV decades ago. Since owning the DVD, I've played it many times, especially the last 15 minutes or so, which features a first-rate performance of Rachmaninoff's concerto 2 (have seen this performed in other films, but none did it anywhere near as well) - and of course, that gorgeous ending! I don't agree with some reviewers here who say the plot is trite, although it could have been fleshed out more. Like the Henry Handel Richardson novel on which it was loosely based,  it explores the themes of obsessive love and artistic dedication, albeit with much less depth. Apart from the three stunningly beautiful leads - especially Ericson, who definitely belongs in the 'why wasn't he a bigger star' category - the supporting cast is top notch. Michael Chekov (nephew of the famous playwright) almost runs away with the film. And then there is Stuart Whitman in an early role, Richard Lupino (cousin of Ida), the tragic Barbara Bates, Celia Lovsky as Liz's sympathetic landlady and, of course, the ever dependable Louis Calhern in one of his last roles.

One minor quibble. Sarasate's Gypsy Airs features just as heavily as the Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff concertos and haunts much of the film, but did not get a mention in the credits.",1490227200,2,1310,4.869955156950673
