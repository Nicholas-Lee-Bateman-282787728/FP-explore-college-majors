7000827,4,B00T5DYUBS,"My daughter (13) and I watched this together, it's a very nice family movie that won't bowl you over but probably won't offend your aesthetic sensibilities either. Lester Speight as Marion (the father) and Skai Jackson as Lacey (the daughter) had a good dynamic and played well off each other without it feeling forced. In fact, I thought the movie as a whole was well cast and well acted but the script, direction and editing were really the weak points. My advice is: suspend judgment and just enjoy it for what it is: a lighthearted family comedy that the whole family can enjoy.",1449878400,,582,4.660194174757281

7000829,4,B00T5DYUBS,"Wonderful family movie w positive messages about quality time, loving family, gaining humility and helping children luv themselves - also really admired that race card was never played at any time; simply a movie about people living loving and laughing all as one !",1443830400,,265,5.045454545454546

7000833,3,B00T5DYUBS,Ok this movie will win no academy awards there are no critically acclaimed performances or deep thought provoking scenes. However it is a family friendly movie with a nice moral message and enough humor to be entertaining.,1433980800,,222,5.027027027027027
7000834,5,B00T5DYUBS,"It is refreshing to see a movie that features a predominately black cast that is not about violence, racism, rap, drugs, or sports. Yes, the main character (""Marion"") is a footballer and the title of the film references Soccer which is obviously a sport, however, the the main emphasis of this film is the family dynamic; specifically that of the father and daughter - the extracurricular activity could've been science or math club and the movie would've been the same. The side plot of the former house-wife (Wendy R. Robinson) becoming a businesswoman and the guilt she feels over it isn't bad either, I wouldn't have minded if that part of the story was fleshed out more. It has some touching moments and is easy to watch, one scene in particular featuring Tracy Gold embarrassing the main character is pretty amusing, and I typically don't care for the roles she plays but she fits in well as a soccer-mom friend that embraces the initially out of place macho-dad, ""Marion"". The script could've been better but the acting isn't terrible. Some of the editing seems a bit off, there were a couple of scenes where it felt as if they should've lasted longer but abruptly switched to another. For those that are curious, this is certainly a family friendly movie, there is no foul language at all or even any innuendos, this is as wholesome as you can get without being corny. If you want something light-hearted and easy to watch or something for the kids to watch, this would be a good pick.

Side note: At the time of this submission, there was only one other review. I will follow his lead and use a random line from the movie as my review title :-)",1433116800,,1653,4.603389830508474
7000835,4,B00T5DYUBS,"Linebacker Marion ""Mad Dog"" Casey (Lester Speight) who has the biggest arms and mouth in the league gets cut. His wife Holly (Wendy Raquel Robinson) opts to do her decorating business full time with her sister, leaving out football star to be ""Mr Mom."" He bonds with their shy reserved daughter Lacy (Skai Jackson) as he secretly signs her up for soccer at the expense of mom's choices, ballet and drama.

The film shows a dad bonding with his daughter and having a good time doing it. It had all the right messages and I had wished the acting and script could have been above the ""made for TV norm."" Drama/family /Comedy rated TV-PG. 3 1/2 stars",1432944000,,646,4.521367521367521
8700471,2,B00T5DYUBS,"We watched this movie because it had both soccer and ballet in it, but no one could dance well and the dad called ballet a weak sport but he couldn't even point his toes or keep his legs straight.",1531872000,,196,4.051282051282051
8700472,5,B00T5DYUBS,"Really cute movie!  The only thing I didn't particularly like was, that it has one of those endings that kind of ends abruptly.",1520640000,,127,4.521739130434782
8700473,2,B00T5DYUBS,"I appreciate the effort of portraying positive black families. However, casting, writing, plot and acting lacked quality and failed to engage. One of the worst movies I've ever  watched. It was evident that the budget for this was extremely limited.",1511913600,,249,5.225
8700474,1,B00T5DYUBS,"My daughter (9) and her friend both play soccer but were bored out of their minds by this movie, as was I. The boys who were over (also 9) bailed 10 minutes in because ""it's so boring"", but the girls and I stuck it out ($$) and were richly *not* rewarded. There is like 1 minute of soccer in whole movie, because really it's about the adults, so kids bored. And I'm bored because even tho it's about adults, the writing is so bland. Nothing happens. It would be a badly written rom com except nothing happens because they're already married. So the only story is whether mom will find out that girl quit ballet for soccer...  Who cares? Spoiler alert: she finds out, and she's okay with it. Nothing happens this entire movie!",1499299200,,725,4.41044776119403

8700476,4,B00T5DYUBS,"This film is a great representation of gender expectations in a family household. The father is a tough football player who loses his job and the mother is a multitasker who returns back to work. Their roles switched as the father had to do the house work and take care of their daughter and the mother went out to work. The mother's goal is to get her daughter and husband to have a father daughter bonding experience. Throughout the film the viewer is able to see how the relationship that the daughter had with her father was a rocky start but eventually they became best friends. The mother did not like the idea as she saw that her daughter wanted to spend more time with her father, her mother instincts kicked in. There were also moments where family-work spillover was shown as the mother couldn't concentrate on her work because she was worried about her daughter and husband. A woman role is to be a mother and a man's role is to be the bread winner but this movie shows that a woman can both work and be a mother and a man can be a father.",1478476800,,1050,4.33502538071066

8700478,4,B00T5DYUBS,The movie was great! The movie kept stopping and buffering like every 10 minutes. It was disappointing and we would have called and complained by the movie was so good.,1453420800,,168,4.633333333333334
8700479,2,B00T5DYUBS,"Long, and drawn out, mediocre acting (except the young girl, who was good). My 11 year old had a difficult time watching it to the end and wanted me to give it 2 stars. I have to agree. Just really blah.",1452988800,,203,3.975609756097561
