8556633,5,B00AQSDMIS,Best superhero movie ever!,1529452800,,26,5.75
8556634,4,B00AQSDMIS,"OK, somewhat silly, mid-to-late 60's Italian-made, English-dubbed adventure with sci-fi touches.  A costumed superhero (he has telekinetic powers) battles a costumed super-villainess.  Argoman's costume is the silliest thing about this film.  Yellow spandex; sound familiar?  Argoman's body tone while costumed is somewhat soft.  He needs to work out.  Not bad film.  The Dorado Films DVD is extremely good quality.  Recommended for fans of Euro adventure films of this period.",1439683200,3,477,5.811594202898551
8556635,1,B00AQSDMIS,It sucks on every level. This is not a new release or production at all. OMG this so bad do not waste your time even if you care about history of heroes in film. This is terrible.,1397347200,,179,3.864864864864865
8556636,3,B00AQSDMIS,"A reasonably good transfer, though unrestored so the color isn't quite as explosive as you sense it could be.  The movie is like a very low rent version of Danger: Diabolik crossed with James Bond.  It doesn't quite succeed, not just because there are plot holes but also because they weren't entirely successful translating their vision to the screen on the budget they had.  (Not everyone can be Bava I guess!)

Pretty sure you could take the basic framework here (thief, antihero, lecherous cad, ridiculous costume) and make a modern version of Argoman...I'd buy a ticket!",1388534400,8,575,4.958333333333333
