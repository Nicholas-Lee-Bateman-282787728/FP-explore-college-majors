2317569,4,B0009S4IO2,"It is kind of scary how much our little boy (21 months) likes this dvd... for a week since we brought it home from the library, he wanted to watch it repeatedly, would accept no substitutes (even Bob the Builder), and started crying when it ended.  Almost 2 weeks later, he still asks for this one at least once a day, although not so insistently.

From a parent's standpoint... my criticisms are that the acting is pretty bad, the lyrics to some of the songs are weak attempts to rhyme, and the bulldozer segment is mostly about demolition (not bulldozers).  Oh, and hearing about ""cement trucks"" pouring ""cement"" always makes me wince (concrete, not cement!)... but that's just an engineer thing.  On the plus side, there's no Dave in these episodes, the songs are catchy, and there's nothing even slightly offensive, so I don't mind watching them over and over.",1210809600,2,864,4.74
2317570,5,B0009S4IO2,"not the greatest production quality - animation is not advanced - but my child LOVES this collection.  The songs will get in your head too, especially after you hear your child singing them when he is not watching the TV...  I will buy more copies for friends with boys with similar likes as my child.  Great sing along feature too - for the times that you don't want to commit to a whole chapter and can just pick one song.",1176076800,2,424,4.275
2317571,4,B0009S4IO2,"This is a really fun video, featuring lots of different footage of trains, trucks, and construction equipment set to kooky songs.  For example, there's a hysterical song about building demolition set to the tune of The Beautiful Blue Danube (""We'll Make It Go Boom!""), which plays over footage of buildings being blown up.  My toddler gets a real kick out of all three episodes, and mommy and daddy find them funny too.

One thing to bear in mind, however, is that this is a DVD re-issue of ten-year-old VHS tapes, so don't expect much when it comes to picture quality.  Considering that source, though, it's pretty decent, and the sound is fine.",1168905600,6,646,4.741071428571429
2317572,5,B0009S4IO2,"This is my 2yo son's request to watch this video - AGAIN.  He loves the songs, they keep his attention, it's quite educational, and it's now my gift for friends with 2yr old boys. His favorite has been ""Fire Truck Songs"" (especially one song from which his ""most exciting"" phrase originates). Now that he knows most of these songs, he's moving on to the Train Songs and Bulldozer Songs.

 Only one drawback- you'll find yourself singing some of these songs in your head...over and over...",1146528000,,488,4.7176470588235295
2317573,5,B0009S4IO2,"We originally rented this movie for my son, and he wanted to watch it all of the time! He cried when we returned it to the movie store. This is a great entertaining video that teaches children all about the workings of trains, firetrucks and bulldozers!! Excellent Buy!!",1128470400,2,270,4.645833333333333
2317574,5,B0009S4IO2,"I am very excited to see that the Real Wheels series are releasing a new DVD of sing-a-long adventures which includes trains, fire trucks, and bulldozers this September.  We own the original sing-a-long Train Songs on VHS and its wearing thin from too much use! Both of my kids simply adore the fun and educational Train Songs, so I am sure they will love the added programs and special features on the new DVD (especially my boys learning about their favorite tyke topics).

I'm also hoping that the new programs supply the same high level of entertainment value as Train Songs did to help keep my energetic kids from bouncing off the walls.  This should be a great back to school treat for the kids (and for myself).",1123113600,,718,4.59375
8066116,5,B0009S4IO2,"I bought this DVD for my two and four year old sons.  The production quality is not very good and looks as if it was made in the 90's, however that is apparently totally unimportant to two machine loving little boys.  They love the real videos of trains, fire trucks, and construction equipment.  They also love the songs.",1384128000,,322,4.517241379310345
8066117,5,B0009S4IO2,"I popped this video in during my active 2 year old grandson's visit yesterday and he sat, almost motionless, on the couch watching it.  This video is ideal for children of any age who like trains, fire trucks, and tractors.",1358121600,,223,4.575
8066118,5,B0009S4IO2,"For those who have children who love trains, fire trucks, and construction vehicles, this movie is perfect.  The songs are cute and the separate movies aren't long at all.  My boys love it.",1357689600,,189,4.696969696969697
8066119,5,B0009S4IO2,It doesn't get much better than this for a two year old! Two of my boys have loved this DVD so much so that I've been through three over the past 10 years.,1312156800,,155,3.727272727272727
8066120,5,B0009S4IO2,"Understand that this is an older DVD and perhaps just a digitized version of an even older VHS version. It has the flavor of something produced in the 80s. That being said... my son couldn't care less!  He loves it & so do I.  The demolition section is especially mesmerizing.  Who doesn't like to watch buildings explode?  Also, the songs are catchy and quite educational.",1303430400,,373,4.6923076923076925
8066121,5,B0009S4IO2,"I first checked this dvd out of the library for my son, who is soon-to-be 3 years old.  He loved the songs and the footage of trains, firetrucks and construction equipment.  Unfortunately, the dvd had many scratches on it which would ""freeze"" the picture at several parts so I just decided to order a brand new one from Amazon.  He just absolutely loves this, a must for any little boy!",1265500800,,386,4.485714285714286
8066122,5,B0009S4IO2,"I love this video for my 2 year old son. I never intended to let him watch any TV whatsoever but here we are. What I like about this video is it's totally non-commercial and paced appropriately for a toddler. The train songs are his absolute favorite and lots of footage of beautiful trains and scenery without any ""infotainment""; information delivered which detract from the pleasure of simply appreciating and watching trains.",1262304000,,428,4.958333333333333
8066123,4,B0009S4IO2,My three-year old grandson liked this DVD. It kept his attention and he watches it over and over.,1260144000,,97,4.444444444444445
8066124,5,B0009S4IO2,My two year old grandson loves this DVD.  I had the VHS tapes for his much older brother and cousin and they loved them too.  This  gives Grammy a time to rest while they learn.  I still enjoy watching them too!,1257552000,,211,4.073170731707317
8066125,4,B0009S4IO2,My five year old is a rail fan. He loves the train songs and the fire truck songs.,1213920000,,82,3.611111111111111
