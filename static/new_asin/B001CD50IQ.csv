8286824,5,B001CD50IQ,"I used to own this one. John Acorn's show was broadcast years ago on Animal Planet. In this episode he talks about moths and then sings a song about them, which is what he does in EVERY Nature nut episode. Some of his songs are so good I can still hear them in my head. I know his videos are still available through his website, but wherever you buy it, his show is loads of fun, always suitable for the classroom, with uniformly high production values. If you are a Nature Nut you need to buy this.",1426118400,,499,4.154639175257732
