8400419,5,B003MONDL4,I love sun salutation Prime of Life Yoga style! Very calming setting and the model demonstrated everything in a way that was easy to follow. I want more videos like this!,1495843200,,170,4.516129032258065
8400420,3,B003MONDL4,"Based on my experience with Larry Payne's Level 1, I thought this would be a GREAT next step, but I don't feel like it adds to my yoga library, so I doubt I'll keep it.
Nice setting.
Costuming - blech.
Poses done well and facial expression of the model? Nah.
Nice music balanced with the narration, but
Larry misses his chance in the narration to give us good pointers on maximize the benefit of the pose or make it truly safe. I am modifying some of the poses to be kinder to my knees and wrists. Also, the 15 minute routine is mostly sun salutations. I like them now and again, but find them here boring and unimaginative. So, Level 1, is more zen, a better yoga routine when one is really feeling a bit under the weather and doesn't want a workout, just great balancing, rejuvenation and healing. I'll go back to that one.",1418342400,,825,4.329032258064516
8400421,5,B003MONDL4,I love Larry Payne's Yoga series! I started with his level one and am starting on level 2. I especially like the choice between the shorter or longer routines on my busy days.,1393891200,,175,4.333333333333333
