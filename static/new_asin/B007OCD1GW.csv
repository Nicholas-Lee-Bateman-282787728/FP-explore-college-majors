5101577,5,B007OCD1GW,Absolutely stunning concert capturing the essence of the band in one of their finest performances. Must buy for any Rac fan!,1356825600,,124,4.9523809523809526
5101578,5,B007OCD1GW,I've been wanting a Racs DVD to come out for a while. I think I have watched almost all of their youtube videos by now and I needed something new haha. It's a good show with a long set and it's nice to finally see a recording of them with better-than-youtube quality.,1353888000,,267,4.153846153846154
5101579,5,B007OCD1GW,"If you are a Jack White, The Raconteurs, or Brendan Benson, you are going to love this dvd.  Not for everyone, of course, but if you're a fan, you'll love it.",1349049600,2,158,4.096774193548387
5101580,5,B007OCD1GW,"I must say, I am a fan of these guys. They are absolutely amazing. I have seen Dead Weather and the new Jack White Solo stuff. I am sad to say I have never seen these guys. I believe it is a career high for both Brendon Bensen and Jack White. This show is the cream of the crop too. I have some live audio from other shows, and their pizzaz is not quite there. This show, is goose bumps the whole way. I am floored by their talent, All of them. The punk who is commenting on the audio quality obviously never dubbed live shows during the rock eras of the past. This is good quality given the lack of studio isolation. Watch them knock out hit after hit with a strange yet perfect dynamic between songs. They know how to ride the crowd... Enough for me to want to jump around the room to some bad a$$ rock and roll... Absolutely worth the investment for those looking for inspirations in Rock.",1346976000,3,892,4.161849710982659
5101581,5,B007OCD1GW,"Well, I liked what the 5 star reviews said, this is a really great concert DVD. I liked Jack White, with the ""White Stripes"", and I really enjoy the music of the ""Raconteurs"". I know they relocated from Jack's hometown of Detroit, down to ""Music City U.S.A."", Nashville. Apparently this was a good move for the band, because, after they moved to Nashville, it seems, this band really ""bloomed"".

As the previous reviews, who gave this a 5 star rating have stated, this is one fantastic concert, from the very beginning to the very end. This is pure Modern American Rock & Roll at it's very best. I love it, and I highly recommed it. Thanks!!!!",1346198400,2,643,4.543103448275862
5101582,5,B007OCD1GW,"The quirky, creative genius that is embodied by Jack White has been manifested again in the unique super group, The Raconteurs, since 2005.  In 2008, they were invited to perform at the Montreux Jazz Festival.  That historic concert was captured on film and is now made available on DVD and Blu-ray and is now made available to Raconteur fans. The 100 minute set was recorded in DTS Surround Sound, Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital Stereo - all in crystal clear, hi-def clarity.

The sixteen song set was comprised of songs from the band's two albums, Broken Boy Soldiers and Consolers of the Lonely as well as a cover of Charley Jordan's classic song from 1940, Keep It Clean.  White and fellow band members, Brendan Benson, Patrick Keeler and Jack Lawrence have the exuberant crowd on their feet the entire time.

In Boomerocity's opinion, the three randomly chosen standout performances (of the sixteen) from the show are:

Hold On - Hard driving alternative rock.  The tune yanks the crowd up by their throats and leaves them on their feet until the end of the show - and the crowd thanking them for such treatment.

The super-charged bluesy Keep It Clean looks like White and the boys were having as much fun performing that song as the crowd was having listening to it.  You could almost transport that performance to the first Woodstock and it would have fit right in.

Finally, the hard driving and dark The Switch and the Spur was a definite crowd pleaser and the DVD watcher will love it, too - leaving all blissfully exhausted from the experience. The band seemed to thoroughly enjoy performing together which leaves one to wonder why they don't perform together any more than they do.  Until they decide to tour or record together again, this DVD will go a very long way in whetting the appetites of the loyal, avid Raconteur fans.
