Just a bad DVD, something you get when you buy on the street.....You know a BOOTLEG DVD.",1381622400,,117,4.130434782608695

8340519,4,B001T4Y17Y,"having spent about two years studying with master Liu before his passing, I found this DVD essential for re-capturing the sequence of forms in his style.  For the beginning student, or even an advanced student, without an instructor in this style, it is not recommended, being of poor quality visually and audio-wise.  And where can one find an instructor in his style?  I've been searching and searching in the NYC area, where there are so many schools in every style: Yang family, Wu, Chen, Shao Lin, and so many variations of these, yet no-one seems to offer instruction in his style, (based on Yang) in the immediate area, nearer than long Island or New Jersey.  That is too bad, as the form is really plain, focused on accuracy of movement, building to cultivation of chi, more than the martial arts aspect, although that was also taught (Da Liu was quite adept at the martial aspect as well as in the healing aspect).

His books offer a great deal of insight into both tai chi, chinese culture and Taoist philosophy, (and its aspects of I Ching, coin prediction, etc... as well as application to tai chi) and are extremely well written.  They are still quoted by students of tai chi today.",1255651200,9,1195,4.666666666666667
