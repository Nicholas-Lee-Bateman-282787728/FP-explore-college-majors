8257112,2,B00151QYIA,"I really couldn't get passed the first disc. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It sat at a very boring medium that just made it kind of unwatchable.

I'd say pass on this one.",1411603200,2,176,4.0285714285714285

8257114,4,B00151QYIA,"I rented this DVD a while back and was really impressed by the integration of 3D with 2D animation.  It's very well done, in a cute and fun way.  The main reason I chose to buy the series was for the special features, which includes two 'making of' videos, hosted by the voice actress of one of the characters(she maintains her character voice through the features).  This set includes 5 episodes, which as far as I can tell is all that was made for the series.  I hope to see more in the future, because the ending does leave a bit to be desired.

There's a fair amount of ""fan-service"" but nothing directly inappropriate.  I'm not sure what amazon says, but I'd recommend at least 13+.",1282780800,5,687,4.412698412698413
8257115,4,B00151QYIA,"Pretty good show.  If you like mindless slapstick, gothic lolita, and/or giant robots this one could be for you.  It is subtitled only, and that's not so great, but otherwise it good.  And it is cheap too, so BONUS!  There's also more than a little fanservice, in the form of numerous pantyshots (including some of the ROBOT!?!?!).",1220227200,6,331,4.754385964912281
