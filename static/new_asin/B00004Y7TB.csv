Aswell as the goon show and several other things.
I recommend this video to every python fan, The BBC did a wonderful job.(aswell as the best of flying circus)

1372634,5,B00004Y7TB,"Being 16 and not around when python came out i don't remember the impact, but they are our best comedy show in the history of Britain.
apart from the goon show, and a few other things.
They're the best and i recommend every python fan to purchase this BBC video (and why you're at it buy the best of flying circus aswell)

1372635,5,B00004Y7TB,"No better way to celebrate 32 years of Python with this set!! For me, the second tape is best. New skits, the Mayday special (for some reason, the Fish Slapping Dance is so much better on here than it was on the Flying Circus), and a look at those musical masterpieces. What disappointed me was they didn't take a look at ""The Penis Song"" from ""Meaning Of Life,"" but they did spend time on The Lumberjack Song, so I cannot complain. Now stop that, that's silly!",1004227200,,461,4.372093023255814
1372636,5,B00004Y7TB,"If you've reached burnout point after watching the Pythons' always-too-small body of work just too many times, pick up The Life of Python.  Besides being a great documentary, it's full of rarities you might never see otherwise: one of the elusive ""Fliegender Zirkus"" episodes, the May Day special, behind-the-scenes footage from their films, etc.  I can't explain why I found the May Day special absolutely hilarious, but it (like the rest of the special on Volume One) unearths some moments of true brilliance - such as Graham Chapman's unexpected turn as a Swede, through nothing more than the use of some old BBC footage run backwards.  The new material is top-notch, as are the performances; seeing most of them together again, even without Chapman (my favorite), gives a Python fan the sense that all is right with the world.  The fact that the special surprises you by going on for an eternity helps as well.
The only comparison I can make is to the Beatles Anthology - some great new material, but mostly a fascinating look at how it all went together.  (Quite an appropriate format for the Beatles of Sketch Comedy.)  And if you're new to Python, or interested in the roots of the wonderful dementia which spawned modern classics like Kids in the Hall and Mr. Show with Bob and David, this compendium does a great job of making sense of it all.",997228800,5,1352,4.731914893617021
1372637,5,B00004Y7TB,"For a Pythonite like myself, frantically clawing away at everything resembling Python for years on end, waiting for something new to happen, this is an incredible set. Wonderful, fantastic, terrific....
Sorry, I'll start again.
This is a very nice set of videos. Tape One is very nice. It is a very nice colour, and has a faint lemonish odour. It's great to see the Pythons do new stuff, especially the old characters, like Arthur Ewing (still at the mice), and Luigi Vercotti. Even new characters have distinct Pythonic family traits (like the BBC Removal Man - isn't he the Gas Cooker man's brother?""). The documentary is one of the best round-ups of Python I've seen, especially seeing stuff like the French Taunter getting his mustache, Brian smoking his pipe, and the wobbly footage of the original script meetings. Pure class.
The second tape gets even better, if slightly less odourous. More new stuff! Reapraisals of Pepperpots (looking more convincing), Gumbies, Fairies and the obligational City Stockbroker (""I'd really love to see someone drown""). Mike does a tour of Pythonland (complete with Japanese guide book), Eric delivers the dirt on WHO Monty Python was, and Carol waves her, erm.... hair.. around. The Spam to Sperm segment is nice, Meatloaf being a, shall we say, interesting host. Oh, and there's that hilarious Ken Shabby reapraisal.
The third tape is just the 2nd German Episode. Seen it before, no real excitement. It's not a bad episode nonetheless. John's expert with a chart is hilarious (""eeenggg heeeii woooh de hargeeeoiiiu...."").
D'you want to come back to my place?",992217600,6,1600,5.0643939393939394
1372638,4,B00004Y7TB,"I loved this set. Things I'd never seen, dirt about the filming of Holy Grail, Brian, & Meaning Of Life. Cleese in a dirndl was quite fetching, & his eulogy of Graham Chapman was almost worth the price of admission. Too bad there were no llamas, & no small marsupials ate the delicious eucalyptus leaves, yum, yum. G'day, Bruce!",988329600,2,328,4.576271186440678
1372639,3,B00004Y7TB,"This disc has its ups and downs, but enough truly wonderful moments (especially Michael Palin's mock-travelogue ""Pythonland"") to make it worth buying for fans of the series. Even the ""biography"" which opens Disc One leaves you wanting more (it jumps from the poorly received Episode One to 'Monty Python and The Holy Grail'), but contains the priceless John Cleese eulogy of Graham Chapman which is absolutely touching and appropriate for Python.
Inexplicably, A&E includes only the second (of two) German episodes on the second disc. Why not include both? (""Never broadcast in the United States""... unless you count the few times its been on PBS).
There are several actual attempts at doing new sketches throughout the first disc. Although they are mostly bizarre misfires (The Gorilla skit ranks right up there with ""Find the Fish"" in the Python pantheon of oddball concepts), it is nice to see that Michael Palin hasn't lost a single step, and its always a treat to see Terry Jones doing comedy again. It is nice that the Pythons made the extra effort here. (Cleese's comment at the end of the ""Mayday"" film is priceless!)",982627200,23,1125,4.957671957671957
1372640,5,B00004Y7TB,"This is a great way to become aware(or re-aware) of just how great the Pythons still are. There are plenty of clips and new interviews with all of them which are informative and funny. There's even on-set footage of ""Holy Grail"" and a so-so 10 min May Day film. The best parts though, are the new skits performed by the Pythons(except Idle), a Palin tour through Pythonland, and one of the German episodes of the Flying Circus. It's great to see that they have not lost their ability to be completely irreverent and silly, and it's neat to see what the spots where they filmed their most famous skits look like now. Also the German episode is surprisingly one of the funnier episodes of Circus I've seen. Unfortunately this DVD does have a few flaws that keep it from being the fitting tribute that they deserve. First of all, what is Meatloaf doing on here? They could have at least found someone who has something to do with Python to do this-like Steve Martin or Kevin Kline. I don't even want to think of Meatloaf, then alone see his ugly mug on a Python tribute. Also this was made by A&E, who put absolutely NO effort into their DVD's. Why is the other German episode not included? I know it's in German, but I CAN READ SUBTITLES. The fact that they have a second DVD that has nothing but a 42 minute episode on it is ridiculous. This DVD may have flaws, but it is definately worth getting because, unless by some miracle they all decide to give it one last try, this is the best we're going to get.",974678400,22,1505,4.378571428571429
1372641,5,B00004Y7TB,"Words can't say how wonderful - truly wonderful - it is to see the remaining Pythons back together again. ""Life of Python"" provides everything but the kitchen sink in terms of history, chronology, and terrific interviews. Monty Python has always been revered as THE transcendent comedy force, and it is refreshing to see that these demi-gods are really some agreeable middle-aged men in comfortable clothing and nice homes. High Points: The lost German episode, The interviews with the Pythons, Palin and Jones talking about the birth of ""Every Sperm is Sacred"", and Michael Palin recreating the very 1st appearance of the ""It's"" man who almost always opened the show. If you're a fan, this set is the best thing you can do for yourself. If you know a fan, buy this for yourself and then tell them where they can get a copy. It's ...",973814400,10,833,4.751724137931035
1372642,5,B00004Y7TB,"Eddie Izzard plays great tribute to the Pythons ""It never ends. So No Ending!""  Meatloaf is an interesting choice for the review of the Musical history of Monty Python, going from Spam to Sperm. Also the German episode is a MUST HAVE for any Python Fan! A fantastic release be sure to order your copy NOW! Well not right now obviously, I mean if your reading this than your obviously not ordering for some twisted sick reason, you make me sick.  Have A Nice Day! :)",970790400,10,465,4.395348837209302

7926890,5,B00004Y7TB,"I'd been looking for this on DVD for some time, and was delighted to be able to find it available for a great price. Some great interviews and insights, a sneak peek at a mini-reunion, and the nice bonus of a Michael Palin travelogue through MP's obscure filming locations in and around London. Highly recommended!",1399939200,,314,4.7272727272727275

7926892,4,B00004Y7TB,"This collection features the Python's 30th Anniversary Special from BBC Two, which aired in America as Life of Python on A&E.  I caught it on Television when it first aired, and had been looking for it on DVD for a while. It is sort of hit or miss with the new material of comedy, but its entertaining enough to see them all (for the most part) together again as Python.

It also includes the 2nd German episode, the first of which was included on ""Monty Python Live!"", which in turn is now included in the Flying Circus 16-Ton Megaset.

Its out of print but worth looking for if you are big Python fan, if you only like the movies and the Parrot sketch, don't waste your time.",1212883200,,677,4.31496062992126
7926893,4,B00004Y7TB,"I LOVE Monty Python.  I have several of their specials taped off the TV.  So when I saw Life of Python available on DVD, I jumped @ it.  It wasn't really the one I wanted.  Monty Python tends to make a lot of minor changes to each of their shows, so that people will buy more than one version trying to get the one they remember.  But all in all I was very happy with my purchase.",1181174400,,380,3.883116883116883
7926894,5,B00004Y7TB,"While I must confess that I did not particularly enjoy the Fliegender Zirkus episode, the first disc alone is well worth the price of the entire product.  Eddie Izzard narrates the ""Life of Python"" segment, which documents the development of the Pythons' wacky sense of humor and their previous jobs on programs such as ""The Frost Report"" and ""Do Not Adjust Your Set"", through the Python series, movies and their various post-Python projects.  Michael Palin's ""PythonLand"" is more for diehards, but for the newbie Pythonite it offers some insight into the filming process the Pythons used.  ""From Spam To Sperm"" is my personal favorite, which covers the many Python songs popularized through the series and movies.  Anyone who has not seen ""The Meaning of Life"" will want to run out and get it after seeing the segment on ""Every Sperm Is Sacred"".

Long story short: something for everyone and well worth the price.",1170979200,,914,4.947712418300654
7926895,5,B00004Y7TB,"This 2-disc set features fantabulous material. Disc one contains all sorts of oddball stuff including Graham Chapman's funeral, A python tribute from the South Park creators (including appearances by Cartman, Kyle, & Kenny), a documenatry on filming locations, songs from Python, and other bits of rubbish culled from BBC archives.

Disc 2 is even better, featuring one of the 2 ""lost"" German episodes. This episode was done in English (unlike the other episode, which was actually in German) and features some truly, truly ridiculous bits including ""Chicken Panning"" and the dumbest fairy tale you'll ever see (featuring a Hammond Organ).

Well worth it, believe me.",1098316800,7,667,5.3428571428571425
7926896,5,B00004Y7TB,"In 1999, the Monty Python team marked their 30th anniversary with a big TV special on BBC2. It featured a ton of brilliant new sketches, the lost Python Mayday Special, a one-hour history of the team, a documentary about their music, a South Park tribute, a Michael Palin travel documentary (about Python locations), and ""Life of Brian."" The special came about after the team couldn't make agreements about a tour or a movie, and while both of those would have been excellent, this TV special manages to capture much of the original Pythonic brilliance. With the exception of ""Brian,"" the 30th anniversary show is presented in this DVD, along with one of the two ""lost"" German episodes (this one is in English). It has some great stuff, especially the Fairy Tale scene.
On DVD, the anniversary show looks broadcast quality, showing no visual flaws (except in old clips and the lost Mayday special.) The German episode looks fairly grainy, but that is to be expected from a rarely restored show. DVD features are on the second disc with the German episode (unless you count the weblink on disc one.) There is a preview of the first German episode, as well as a quiz and clip show from the ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" Season Four discs.",1046304000,7,1237,4.758139534883721
7926897,5,B00004Y7TB,"I was very pleased to view this documentary and other various programs on this 2 disc set. First off it includes BRAND NEW sketches with all of the cast except for Eric Idle, who although does not appear in the sketches, he does appear at the end of the mock interview sequence (which only lasts about 1 minute). It also would have been nice to see Graham Chapman but of course that was impossible. Most of the new sketches are good except the timing on the jokes was not quite as sharp or quick. Even Carol Cleveland appears and she still looks great. There is a rare 10 minute short film made in 1971 celebrating the Mayday Festival that was lost for years. A Pythonland tour with Michael Palin covering some the original areas where the classic Python sketches were filmed is also a plus. But the big attraction is a Monty Python episode that was made specifically for a German audeince. It was 1 of only 2 ever made. Very Rare Indeed! It is the second show of the two shows. The first show is not included although there is a clip of it in the bonus features are of the dvd.",1031616000,9,1078,4.315270935960591
7926898,5,B00004Y7TB,This is a documentary of the men and work of Monty Python.  Great video.  I saw this on PBS and loved it.,1018224000,4,105,3.727272727272727
