4082456,5,B0037UJ5W4,"Great entertainment.  The first thing you see is the motel room door opening and the last thing you see is the door closing.  But it is what happens in between that will have you talking about this little masterpiece at the watercooler the next few days.  This movies power is felt instantly, metaphorically clutching you by throat and forcefully transporting you inside of that cramped nicotine stained motel room where no one is who they seem.  The pace and tension build like the pressure in a tea kettle simmering at first, continuing to rise until it reaches full boil.  And like the teapot it makes a hell of a racket when Sympathy is finally over.  I like everything about this movie, the acting was first rate, the chick was sexy. The directing and editing is far better than most big budget movies and the sound was fantastic.  But like all great movies it was the story that makes all of this magic happen.  Arik Martin is a great storyteller, his screenplay is full of twists and turns and ""I didn't see that coming"" that I was greatly entertained.  Through excellant writing the characters come to life and you find youself liking them at different times and then hating them and then your not sure what to think.  Good writing has that effect on an audience, I know it suely did it to me.  My congrats to all who helped bring Martin's story to life.  I can't wait until Arik Martin's next movie.",1272412800,4,1408,4.5436507936507935
4082457,5,B0037UJ5W4,I have seen this film and it is an outstanding exercise in tension and surprise. There's an event that happens at the sixty minute mark and then another one minute later that will have your jaw on the floor. This is quite a stunner of a movie and definitely worth the purchase.,1271030400,12,277,4.346153846153846

8390789,5,B0037UJ5W4,"Wow.  While this movie dragged at times, it does pick up towards the end and you really don;t see what is coming, and there is very little if any forshadowing of the outcome.  It's a thriller, to be sure.  I noticed quite a few amaturish camera cuts.  In fact, it became sort of like a game to find the ""bloopers"".  But that did not distract from the interest in the outcome of the plotline.  Check it out.  I promis you will like it.",1329264000,,434,4.156626506024097
8390790,3,B0037UJ5W4,"SYMPATHY has its good and bad points. The best thing is the ending, which is one of the coolest, twistiest I've seen in any thriller. The final 15 minutes are priceless and intense. The problem lies in actually getting there, as the 103 minute run time of the film tends to drraggg. This is magnified by the fact that the entire movie takes place in one tiny motel room! Now, this adds to the tension and claustrophobic feel, but it just seems to go on forever, at times going back and forth over the same conversations. If they could have sliced off about 15 minutes of dross, this would have been a classic. As it stands, while still quite watchable, it has many tedious moments that take away from the suspensefulness of the whole...",1308441600,,736,4.5
8390791,4,B0037UJ5W4,"Trip is an inexperienced bank robber with a hostage and a plan to drive to Canada. Spending the night in a roadside motel, he has his captive, Sarah, chained to the bed, her feet tied, and duct tape across her mouth. Unfortunately for him, Sarah is the one of the feistiest, most fearless hostages you'll ever meet. And there's a third player waiting in the wings. All of which is going to make for a very bad night for Trip.

Sympathy takes place entirely in one room, with a very small cast. The actors are pushed to their limits, emotions and power shifting and twisting from moment to moment as they play cat and mouse games all night long. The cast is well up to the challenge, creating believable, complex characters with a minimum of props and other actors to play off of. As the night progresses, we develop a certain twisted attachment to liars, thieves, and murderers.

The plot has many twists, so many that we genuinely don't know who will survive, or how. If you can overlook some initial hard-to-swallow events that set up the rest of the story, Sympathy will keep you engaged and thinking until the very end. This debut picture by Andrew Moorman promises very good things to come.",1301011200,4,1195,4.579439252336448
8390792,3,B0037UJ5W4,"Not a bad storyline; could have been a GREAT erotic thriller.  Overall not bad but if you can, rent it, don't buy it.",1295827200,2,117,4.086956521739131
8390793,2,B0037UJ5W4,"Overacted, poor audio, no closed caption, impossible connection after what those 2 guys did to each other. Nothing original.",1285891200,,124,5.578947368421052
8390794,1,B0037UJ5W4,I purchased this video expecting it to be more than just one long continuous scene in a hotel room. I soon grew bored with it.,1283731200,4,126,4.08
8390795,2,B0037UJ5W4,I could find nothing intersting in this movie. Takes place in a sleeze bag motel  wow!!!  this is not worth the time of day. Save your money go unto the next.,1279584000,4,158,4.064516129032258
8390796,5,B0037UJ5W4,"From the very beginning everyone in the house was hooked from 17 years olds to 60 year olds, we were on the edge of our seats. It was hard to believe that it all took place in one hotel room that was constructed from an old barn. Amazing photography and characterization",1275004800,11,270,4.313725490196078
