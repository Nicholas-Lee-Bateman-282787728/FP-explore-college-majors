8465652,5,B005CM1IJS,"Entitled ""The Eternal Road, Kurt Weill, Max Reinhardt and Meyer Weisgal's operatic Jewish response to Hitler's Germany"", this is not a DVD of the Eternal Road itself but a film about a wonderful production of the Eternal Road in Chemnitz in eastern Germany and about the first production of the work in New York and the tragic and evil events in Germany that led to its production. There are only very brief clips of either production shown on the DVD. This documentary DVD is like a DVD extra. It is an interesting 58 minute long introduction to the work. The Eternal Road itself is most impressive and is of immense historical importance and it has a massive and highly significant score. Weill's vast opera/oratorio depicts a synagogue community, surrounded by hostile forces during Krystalnacht or similar happenings. The community, at risk of their lives, perform their history, from the time of Moses. It is the community's last performance and is a tense drama expressed in both spoken text and sung opera. There is a grainy DVD of a broadcast on a French arts channel of the Chemnitz production with French only subtitles, available on the Premier Opera label. Despite its technical shortfalls it is really worth getting. The Chemnitz production is very special. There is also a fine CD of highlights conducted by Gerard Schwarz that was recorded following a performance at the Berlin Schauspielhaus/Konzerthaus, on the Naxos label. It has the text in English of a third of the work. Then, for the really keen,  Franz Werfel's text of the work can be bought in book form in the English version.",1429833600,3,1602,4.889705882352941
8465653,2,B005CM1IJS,"For those who know anything at all about the original production of Kurt Weill's THE ETERNAL ROAD, this video has very little to offer. It briefly deals with a staging of the show in Germany. But the video focuses (like an old-fashioned newsreel) on the event itself, with very little information on about the original show. I had hoped to learn more about the original production and perhaps see more photographs or (if available) film-clips of the original production than I had before, but you'll learn nothing of value about the show itself from this this film.",1397606400,5,565,4.835051546391752
