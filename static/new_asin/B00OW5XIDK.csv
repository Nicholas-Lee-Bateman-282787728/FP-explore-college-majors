8685132,5,B00OW5XIDK,"A thoroughly enjoyable western.  Well above the standard fare of a B-western.  Cesar Romero is an engaging Cisco.  Chris Pin-Martin is Gordito, a Pancho substitute.  Mary Beth Hughes does a splendid job as the saucy saloon girl who saves Cisco from the rope at the end of the movie.  Dana Andrews has an early role as the cavalry sergeant who just never gets it right.  It's a good cast.  The story is fast-paced and has an excellent script.  You will like the movie if you like early westerns.",1491004800,,494,4.534090909090909
