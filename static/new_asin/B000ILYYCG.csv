8167997,1,B000ILYYCG,"Horrible VHS Transfers. The only watchable film is COLD SWEAT, which is also the only film in widescreen. Best stick with the MGM Death Wish 2 - 3 - 4 & Assasination Pack. Very good widescreen quality. This one only cost me $5 at my local department store, but it was $5 wasted.",1407283200,,278,4.264150943396227
