3824595,2,B001W9EUCW,"Don't believe the hype. This is average at best. Yes, Tom Hardy is great in it but that's about it. His performance can't save this train-wreck. To sum it all, full of cliches and  predictable story line. Go watch Goodfellas or Boardwalk Empire for some real gangsters thrills.",1324598400,7,277,4.770833333333333
3824596,5,B001W9EUCW,"Tom Hardy is magnificent in this short TV series.  I'm not knocking the great supporting cast, they are all good, especially the two female leads, but Hardy's perfomance steals every scene he is in. Based on a best selling book by Martina Cole, this is a mash-up of The Sopranos and The Town, with amazing drama and acting, but takes place on the other side of the pond. Hardy is well on his way to being a big name star.",1319068800,27,421,4.2625
3824597,5,B001W9EUCW,Superb performances by Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley! Tom Hardy was incredibly believable as Freddie Jackson! He even looks  like a COMPLETELY different person altogether! I love this movie!,1318723200,4,190,5.551724137931035
3824598,3,B001W9EUCW,"At points, the background music is too loud. Music is used to set a mood, but, if I can't hear what the actors are saying, then the mood is lost. The part right around the TV scene comes to mind as an example of this.

I think that the show got better as it went along. Tom Hardy is good at playing the roughest characters and giving them a part you can sympathize with. However, I didn't really feel that way with this character. You can't help but hate him throughout. I think that both female leads did great (Charlotte Riley and Kierston Wareing).",1317340800,7,551,4.298076923076923
3824599,5,B001W9EUCW,"Hard to watch in its violence, but a brilliant character study of so many aspects of humanity.

There were a few 'I don't believe it' moments for me, the ending for one I found unbelievable, as if the writer couldn't figure out how to end it.

Secrets abound, everyone knows something about someone.

Excellent acting, I never knew what was coming, but some plot holes, in my opinion.",1296172800,3,384,4.617647058823529
3824600,5,B001W9EUCW,"I bought this dvd set when it was only available in Region 2 (UK). I had heard great things about it and I had seen Bronson and RocknRolla. This is a brilliant miniseries, starring an ensemble cast that includes Tom Hardy (Inception, Bronson) and Brian Cox. The story line takes place over a decade when mob bosses went from old school to new. The lead character, Freddie, comes out of prison all set to resume his climb up the ladder when he discovers the new school is in charge. Freddie is a psychopath, but there are redeeming features to him. His sense of fair play is admirable but has lethal consequences. He is a ""might makes right"" kind of guy. His depth of anger at disloyalty is taken out not only on those who have cut him down but on those his betrayers love. He is at once a tender loving husband and father (he has two sons ... but can't say more) and a hurtful, neglectful abuser  There is so much to enjoy about this series, it's a shame I can't tell more without writing a SPOILER. The performances are electric, especially Hardy's. There is  violence, but it's not gratuitous.  This is not the Brit version of The Sopranos. It has quite a different treatment on the theme ""Mobsters Are People, Too.""  Do see this; it is excellent. Exciting, suspenseful, with an emotional core. An added attraction: the surprise ending!",1291248000,13,1338,4.539419087136929

3824602,5,B001W9EUCW,Decent show.  I love Tom Hardy and everything he does. The show had a lot of shocking moments.  Way too short.  I really enjoyed each and every episode.  Was never sure what to expect.,1524614400,,184,4.323529411764706

3824604,2,B001W9EUCW,Incredibly boring British crime thriller. Sort of a low end The Krays. The only reason to watch is to see Brian Cox' performance. The lead actress has so much botox in her upper lip that the lip kills every scene. There are so many grade A Brit crime dramas to watch. Don't waste your time with this 4 episode mess.,1524355200,,315,4.266666666666667
3824605,1,B001W9EUCW,"The show itself is straight forward.  This show was disappointing because it could have been a hit if someone else had played the lead role.  Tom Hardy just fails to deliver.  I have been a fan of his since 'RocknRolla'.  Sadly, this television series highlights his weakness as an actor.  Other players in the 'RocknRolla' production have gone on to play a wide range of characters (Elba and Butler, just to name two).  Hardy does not appear to have learned anything in the past 12 years.  This show could have been a hit if someone else had played the lead role.  Sorry, Tom, but you're proving you're not a great actor.  Taboo is another great example of how an actor with no range can tank a production.",1524096000,,707,4.503937007874016

3824613,1,B001W9EUCW,"I've watched 2 episodes and I have to say this series is really bothering me.  After the shocking brutal rape of Ep. 2  (such an unacceptable event in real life OR in fiction), and the continuing full and wanton destruction of families we are watching, including the haunting scenes of deeply emotional hurts inflicted on children who must live around all this disintegration, can no longer be born by this viewer.  Why should I or anyone else want to watch this??

In fact, I find it disturbing still on this new day, after watching those 2 episodes.  My brain is trying to reconcile how such human beings as this STILL stalk the earth in these modern times.  And in fact, I know they do, as a 70 year old man Ive observed them close up in isolated instances in my long life and have felt their stalking presence as early as in my young teens in the industrial town where I grew up, and then later when drafted into the US Marine Corps during Vietnam.  These brutal young men still roam this earth and arise anew in every generation, and yes, with their various shades of narcissism linked with raw brutality and heated destruction all around them.  And they relish it, even as they may at times struggle with its real consequences.  But when given the chance, they do it all over again.

It is depressing to ponder how this speaks of the long history of humanity, where for most of it, no laws existed for the protection of innocence and rationality, and wherein all innocent things were subject to such unbelievable outrages at any given moment should such a one of these beasts arrive.  The whole ancient underpinnings of homo sapiens would seem to be just such a dark long story as this, and all manner of its unspeakable iterations of brutalities, degradation, enslavement and destruction.  And truly, only confronting it with equal and overwhelming force, and yes violence and determination to stand up against it, can ever hope to halt it, when it has come upon you and your loved ones.  Thus, how can anyone watch this series, and confront this full, raw reality and not tremble... in fear and self-righteous, indignatious outrage, and determination to oppose it.., to stand for what is best and pure and right, and not what is degraded and corrupt?

And too, in trying to reconcile what viewing this has done to me (by reminding me of its base reality), I find myself denouncing this production. Just how can anyone justify placing small children into central elements of scenes designed to impact upon us, the viewers, the deep fullness of the destruction going on around them and impacting their innocent lives?  Yes, these children are ""actors,"" but they are not adults, they area still children!  They lack the full capacities of mature adults to understand this terrible story and the brutal scenes they are put into.  How can these practices NOT have impacts on their little psyches?  This is, in fact, some primordial stuff going on here, and YES, it has impacts on their small immature developing emotions, no matter how the adults in this production want to rationalize it away.  How can any parent or filmmaker NOT realize this?  I could never stomach putting little children into these scenes and then giving them roles designed to demonstrate for viewers how they are being deeply, emotionally traumatized.  How do you expect mature viewers to endure this?  How are we to find this acceptable as ""entertainment?""  No, I'm too old to even allow THIS in my presence.

I found myself drawn to peek back into this story to see if it holds any hope of righting itself, but in reading the reviews I see that it does not.  It's another long spiraling, sinking and burning ship, reminiscent of mindless brutalities seen in Boardwalk Empire.  I endured that one only to reach what it brings as a pure, cynical and hopeless end.  And what for?  I can tell you I choose, and have always chosen,  to live a life on other paths than these.  And I thank God there are human beings who spend their lives standing against the things in these stories.  And to you producers who just so badly want another lucrative paycheck, I would simply suggest to get another life.  I know you rationalize away these child scenes. Some of us cant.

I give it one star, simple because I haven't (nor plan to)  seen it all.",1523404800,4,4313,4.66887417218543

But one thing is certain: Tom Hardy is a psychopath for real. The Take is uncomfortable to watch and in two episodes covers as much territory as an entire series of seven seasons does of any other show. What could possibly happen next?

3824616,3,B001W9EUCW,"Some great acting, as you would expect....but a disappointing story.  It's a crime drama where every single thing that happens is entirely expected.  There are zero twists, zero surprises.  This comes from the source material, I assume, but the reason to watch something like this (besides being a Hardy fan) is to not know what's coming next.  This series has nothing like that, so it comes off as just ticking boxes of who is going to get beaten up or killed next, in EXACTLY the order you expect....all the way to the end.",1523059200,,525,4.612903225806452

As the plot progresses, still building to this coup de gras of Freddie, which you find yourself supporting, is frightful.

Tom Hardy. Shaun Evans.  Each is able to completely mesmerize; put both on the same screen and it's nigh overwhelming!  It's almost too much to bear.

Besides the obvious similarity to The Sopranos in subject matter, there is this commonality: absolutely stellar performances by every member of the cast. Very rarely can one find virtually no fault or weakness in a cast. This series is one of those few which achieves that level of perfection.  The writing is excellent; the storyline is intense and believable.  It's one of those, what I call ""perfect storms"": the writing, directing, the actors, editing, etc. etc., all happened to come together at the right time, in the right place, to produce something truly extraordinary.

But I gotta single out Tom Hardy.  My God, you can't take your eyes off him!  He's one of those actors like Bette Davis, or Robert Mitchum, or Spencer Tracy--who absorb you through the sheer force of their personality.  I know he's famous and admired, but still he is under-rated.  His should be a household name.

Two cons however:  1)  background music too loud  2)  Cockney accent is a real challenge and unable to access Closed Captions, which would help tremendously.  Even with rewinding I often couldn't get the exact wording, but with Hardy in the picture, who cares.  I got the drift in all cases.  This is a fabulous performance, again.

I haven't seen a ton of Hardy's work, but this is his best role from what I've seen. Hardy takes you through a non-stop train ride on what it's like to be around a truly toxic psychopath, and never for a moment lets up to allow a thread of sympathy to come through. He makes Tony Montana look like Wayne Brady. This series is at times difficult to watch due to it's level of unapologetic grit, but if you have thick skin and love the genre, you'll be happy you did.",1370822400,2,736,4.257142857142857

Playing so much grace and brokeness at the same time. It's not for the faint of heart, there are some really tough parts that are hard to swallow but if you can make it through it's pretty dang good.",1362441600,12,481,4.182795698924731

3824707,5,B001W9EUCW,"I ordered it recently and I can't stop watching it. Yes Tom Hardy (with his fine self) does an excellent job as well as the rest of the cast. I am totally impressed with Charlotte Riley. It was heart-wrenching to see her play a woman who'd been through so much (and had to keep it a secret) and over time even more tragedy comes into her life (sorry don't want to reveal too much). There is definitely the Mobster-thing going on...but also it's as if you're watching what is so true to real life. We've all seen elements of this movie in one way or the other. For instance (what I will reveal is...) ""Freddie"" having access to so many women, but wanting someone he can't get. We see this kind of thing all the time in the real world. I wished that it had subtitles. I can't understand some of the English accents. It is also noteworthy to acknowledge the acting of ""Little Freddie"" and ""Jimmy"". ""Jimmy"" (Maggie's husband) goes from a relative ""good guy"" to a true gangster and enforcer (especially after their tragedy).
Yes, there were some violent moments, but when you watch it, you realize that they could have showed alot more than what they actually did. For instance, why ""Jackie"" ended up injured at the hospital, and what happened between ""Maggie"" and ""Freddie"" could have been shown longer and with more details. So this movie holds back a lot after you watch it...you'll see that. I really really wish it was longer.
Tom Hardy is good, but I hope he doesn't get too big in this industry...that ""Hollywood Machine"" seems to entice (some people survived better than others) people, then chew them up...and spit them out.  After watching this...in my opinion ofcourse...you'll wish the series was longer and with more details. At the very end...you can see that there is a possibility for a continuation...but no. The main character is no longer there and it would not be the same without him.  As I said, great movie!!!",1346371200,8,1927,4.631578947368421
3824708,5,B001W9EUCW,"Wow this guys Tom hardy has anger issues, and uses them to produce some of the most brillaint acting we have seen since early Sean Penn or Edward Norton. The performace he gives in The Take makes his performace in the Warrior seem tame and restrained. Now the supporting case is also amazing as is the writing and direction. I was just fortuate enough to come accross this series one day on Starz I beleive, and now want to find it in Blu-Ray.",1338336000,3,443,4.349397590361446
3824709,5,B001W9EUCW,"Ntoe: I saw this IV-episode series with XFinity On Demand.

This series, adapted from a novel I've never heard of nor read, is nonetheless compelling for its story and its dark look at the criminal underworld. Should have been longer, in my opinion. Tom Hardy, Charlotte Riley, Shaun Evans and the actress who plays Tom Hardy's wife are all believable in their roles. My only complaint is that the thick Irish accents of some of the actors make some of the dialogue indiscernible at times. Though it's rated TV-MA, most the the violence is off-screen, but what is depicted of it is usually graphic...and there's frequent cursing throughout, though thankfully, not Scarface-level swearing, and there are several sex scenes, including a rape in the second episode. With that in mind, the series is definitely not for kids and could safely have been rated TV-14.",1338336000,5,859,4.965277777777778

3824711,5,B001W9EUCW,I don't know how anyone could not like this. I realize not everyone has the same taste but apparently not everyone is aware of that fact.  Anyway it was like a British sopranos/breaking bad (to me) and not just in the respect that crime is involved. Uber violent but the violence serves a point.,1328572800,,295,4.462962962962963
8347259,3,B001W9EUCW,"Tom Hardy plays an exceptionally vicious and manipulative sociopath (a role he seems to have perfected over the course of several productions). He just got out of prison and wants his cut of the local organized crime action. His wife and kids plead for attention (what is up with her fake upper lip?), his cousin distances himself from his impulsive, reckless behavior, and the consequences of a shameless life, devoid of true remorse, comes to a crashing halt.",1527897600,,461,4.923076923076923

8347261,5,B001W9EUCW,"It took me a minute to realize that not only was the main character here the spitting image of Charles Bronson ... but is played by the same actor, Tom Hardy.

Not sure what his filming schedule was but it seems like this was released just after ""Bronson"" ... and I guess maybe he just kept doing his Bronson thing with the mannerisms and all that ... or maybe that's just how Tom Hardy is (though for some reason I doubt it).

None-the-less this is pretty good ... and if you like ""Bronson"" ... I can't imagine you won't like this.",1526860800,,532,4.257425742574258
8347262,5,B001W9EUCW,"Another good acting job from Tom Hardy.  The story focusses on Freddie Jackson (Hardy), a psychopath released from prison, and his cousin Jimmy (Shaun Evans) as they do the bidding of a local mob boss Ozzy (Brian Cox) while he remains behind bars.  I had to spend some time getting used to the thick cockney accents but it was sure worth it.  I knew Hardy would provide a great performance but the real surprise to me was how Shaun Evans held his own with both Tom Hardy and Brian Cox.  Evans was amazing as Jimmy who adores his older cousin Freddie but circumstances lead Jimmy to make some hard decisions that impact him deeply.  We get to watch Jimmy change through the 4 episodes and its wonderful to watch.  This is a hard hitting series with memorable performances all around.  Hardy could not be more despicable but you can't take your eyes off him...as usual.  This series is not for wimps.  There's a scene between Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley where you can actually feel  his hatred for her from your living room chair.  You'll know which scene when you see it.  They have since married but you'd never know they had any kind of romantic connection from the roles they play here.  This series is filled with talented actors giving top notch performances.  Give it a try if it sounds like something up your alley.",1526515200,,1323,4.5508474576271185

Shaun Evans did a fantastic job showing the evolution of his character while Tom  Hardy matched his performance as a totally conscienceless sociopath.  The supporting cast were all excellent as well, even the kids.  Bit of a surprise at the end there, but I enjoyed this.
