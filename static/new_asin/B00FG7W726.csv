8615537,5,B00FG7W726,"If you are as frustrated as I am regarding the overinflated prices of the long out-of-print Disney Treasures DVDs, the European collections are a steal. You get 5 of the boxed sets rolled into one for an incredibly low price. The only drawback is you need a DVD player that can play Region 2/PAL format. But you could easily get a region-free DVD player with the money you save going this route. I hope the other cartoon-themed boxed sets see the light of day in Europe and drive back down the costs of the other Disney Treasures DVDs.",1432771200,7,535,4.469387755102041
