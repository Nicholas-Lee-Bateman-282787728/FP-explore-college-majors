Everyone loved. It sparkled a great environmental discussion. The movie is very well done: great editing, cinematography and direction. I would definitely recommend it! Also, I would suggest you to do what I did: get some friends together to watch it. It's fun, interesting and it'll sparkle a wonderful conversation afterwards.",1259193600,2,505,5.023809523809524
3702392,1,B001MWGZ6S,"Obtaining clean water is a problem. . .  however this movie is dull and boring.

1. It's organized poorly.

2.  It says things which are dead wrong like ""Once you use the water in a lake it is gone forever.""  No, water in lakes are continually replenished.  Infact you can build lakes, ponds, etc. to hold water.

3.  It doesn't spend enough time on any one specific problem.  I wanted to know about the water problem in Atlanta, Georgia.  The movie says three sentences and then moves on.",1254009600,27,489,4.454545454545454

3702395,4,B001MWGZ6S,"We hear a lot about a global oil shortage.  Even more ominous is the growing shortage of water in the world, a shortage being compounded by global warming which is reducing the snow melt, a key factor in creating the water flow for rivers.  An ugly secret of the ""green revolution"" that reduced hunger has been the huge expansion of pumping out underground aquifers around the world.  From Arizona to northern China water tables have been falling rapidly for years.  The percentage of world crops dependent on irrigation has soared in the last 50 years.  Even the US CIA sees water as a severe global crisis.  I don't agree with all the points in this DVD but it serves as a wake up call about what is to come.

3702396,5,B001MWGZ6S,"We can't live without water. You may have thought it was a human right. But certain corporations have been plotting to control the water supply on this planet for a while now, and have been moving into place around the globe. Now the World Bank has required certain governments to privatize their precious water supply -- make it a corporate commodity answerable only to stockholders -- as a condition to getting a loan. In some places it is now illegal to catch rainwater, because rain is being considered private property, including the United States. The evil of this worldwide corporate grab for control of your most precious resource is practically inconceivable, but it is happening. Blue Gold: World Water Wars is a landmark documentary that every school, library and church should own and show. Do you want the cost of your water to be controlled by private corporations and stockholders only interested in their bottom line? Do you want to give up your right to the water around you, including rain? It is time to get educated and get active. Start with this film.",1243814400,99,1073,4.836956521739131
3702397,5,B001MWGZ6S,"I found this movie via torrentfreak which featured an article about the response of the independent film-maker to his movie being shared via torrent. His response was well written and thought out and simply asked for a donation if  you respected what he was trying to do (donate to him via [...] I immediately donated but it wasn't until a couple of days later that I thought it would be worthwhile seeing something created by such a level headed and thoughtful man.

And am I glad I did! It was great! The material was important and in a lot of ways it was tragic but it was put together in a way that gave a human face to the suffering without rubbing your nose in it and actually gave hope that individuals could make a difference. It could have gone over the top and produced another 'corporations are evil' movie but it was toned down enough that you didn't dismiss it out of hand and listened to the important message.

The first hour and a bit is a lot to handle but it is offset by the upbeat ending which shows ways in which changes are being made for the better: basically ""its not all doom and gloom, we have a big problem but we know the solution and can point to cases where it has worked"".",1242950400,32,1203,4.290748898678414

3702411,5,B001MWGZ6S,this is a very informative documentary about the world we live in and the fresh water supply we have on our planet. I highly recommend this documentary to anyone interested in gaining knowledge and insight in what the future has in store for use. after watching this I had to reevaluate the way I personally use water and purchase it (I try not to water should be free). I also learned that 3 states in the USA it is illegal to collect rain water.(land of the free?) how could this be possible. The most mind blowing part of this documentary is that water has been deemed a profitable commodity for sale to the highest bidder. Even the Bush family has invested in the worlds largest aquifer in South America for the preservation of their family in the future. Definitely a mind blowing experience I have shared this documentary with several friends and family members. A must see. World War 3 will not be based on Religion but for the simple necessity of Clean Fresh Water. BE AWARE. To anyone who is a prepper stock pile water it is BLUE GOLD.,1413417600,,1044,4.5

3702417,1,B001MWGZ6S,"Oh my God the sky is falling. Look, I'm a liberal extremists are seeing pictures in the stars. If theres enough dots then you can draw any picture you want. Nearly everyone talking is a wing nut activist calling a fire cracker a nuclear bomb. They don't back up their claims with any sort of peer reviewed research, they don't cite any legitimate sources. They take cheap shots at the World Bank?! They talk about dams as though they stop water from flowing?! It regulates and normalizes water flow you idiots! You know, to stop it from killing people in floods, and eroding huge amounts of topsoil just to dump it into the ocean! They act as if water that gets used somehow dissapears?!

Look there are definitely issues to be addressed, points to be made, and solutions to come to but I'm so sick of people taking something that should be a 2 and calling it a 10. polution of streams and rivers from industry, contamination of groundwater from pesticides and chemicals, the acidification of the oceans.

3702421,3,B001MWGZ6S,Blue Gold calls our attention to the critical issue of the future of water. It also provides some political commentary especially on the attempts to privatize and control water.

Also does a good job of explaining the rather confusing situation of water rights and privatation of water supplies.  Unlike many other such documentaries, it ends on a positive note.  Not sure that is a good thing because it might make some feel everything is going to work out and nothing is required of them to do anything about the situation.

However, the film did enlighten to some degree. Even though it's obvious, it never occured to me that when you export water from one location to another location, you are removing that water from the local water cycle, increasing the desertification of that area.

The film never mentions that removing water from a flood-prone area and piping / shipping it to a drought prone area could be beneficial.

The film advocates only one view, that people should live within the volume of water available within the local water cycles. Exporting water, or using more water from an aquifer than is replenished is not an option.

3702479,5,B001MWGZ6S,"The most important take-home message from this film is that water scarcity is a much more serious and urgent problem - especially in the industrial north - than climate change.

I previously believed that chemical and nutrient pollution was the greatest threat to our fresh water supply. However according to Blue Gold, run-off is actually the biggest problem - the loss of fresh water when rainwater winds up in the ocean instead of being trapped by the ecosystem as groundwater. Only 3% of global water is freshwater to begin with, and much of this had been so badly polluted it's no longer usable.

The three main ways urbanization accelerates run-off includes the construction of 50,000 dams worldwide, the paving over of soil with cement and asphalt, deforestation (destroying tree roots that normally trap water), and the destruction of wetlands (the destruction of mangroves and other plants that naturally purify water.

Aquifer depletion (via the extraction of groundwater reserves) has also reached crisis proportions - largely due to industrial agriculture, the massive unregulated use of water manufacturing, and the large scale water extraction by powerful multinational corporations, such as Coke and Nestle, for their bottled water and soft drink plants. Once the water from the aquifer is gone, it can rarely be replaced, as many of these companies claim. The film gave several examples of local communities where citizens, across the political spectrum, banded together to block these companies from taking their water. Some cases have involved long expensive court battles, with several corporations threatening individual activists who have spoken out at hearings with SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) suits.

The last half of the film focused on water privatization, water desalination, and water wars. It showed how water privatization is already a life and death issue in many developing countries, where governments have ceased to definite access to clean water as a human right - but as an economic commodity that can be bought and sold. There were several very poignant vignettes from Africa where private companies have taken over the public water supply and set the price of fresh water so high that people were forced to drink polluted water and died. It showed how the exorbitant cost of fresh water, after Bolivia sold its water supply to Bechtel, sparked a mass rebellion and ultimately the collapse of the Bolivian government.

At the end the film also offers a number of positive solutions:
1. Learn where your water comes from - the specific name of the watershed and the name of the company that controls it. Local communities need to actively fight attempts by your local authorities to allow water extraction or the takeover by private companies of local water supplies.
2. Kick the bottled water habit. This is a trick advertisers play on you. It is no healthier for you than tap water (and may be less healthy owing to phthalates and bisphenol A from the plastic that may be linked with breast cancer and low sperm counts). People who dislike the taste of tap water can easily remedy this with a little lemon juice.
3. Lobby your local and state leaders to
* Remove hydroelectric dams and replace with newer, more eco-friendly distributed microturbine systems.
* Adopt an active run-off management plan in which lost groundwater is measured and minimized in development planning - and replaced, for example via the Blue Alternative (in which groundwater is replaced by digging small catchment pools in open spaces).
* Pass local and state resolutions and constitutional amendments recognizing access to fresh water as a basic human right. Uruguay has adopted the right to water in the national Constitution.",1290816000,6,3768,5.180623973727422

Fortunately, there are now technologies that can make water from air. There is a technology that can make water from air using only the sun energy that is sustainable & efficient, a company AquaScience is already making water from air with humidity as low as 14% but it is not with renewable energy.

Google search ""Water from Air"" and you can see the many technologies available to make water from air.

In regard to coastal cities around the world, there has always been water desalination technologies using Reverse Osmosis and recently Nuclear Desalination. Reverse Osmosis is energy intensive so economically it is not very attractive source of water. A better option would be a Hybrid Desalination system using Electrodialysis & Reverse Osmosis combine by EET Corp. that uses 70% less energy than Reverse Osmosis alone. A superior option would be Solar Desalination technologies where the sun energy is use to turn ocean water to water vapor, the water vapor is then condense back to liquid water using a fraction of the energy use by reverse osmosis. The best option would be Nuclear Desalination using Waste Heat from a nuclear reactor, that is free, to Desalinate water.

Private companies are buying up water rights all over the world and it does not appear that they are investing a great deal of money into water conservation. Some of those water rights were sold by corrupt officials who were later jailed. With the owning of governments by corporations, they can pretty much get away with anything and do whatever they want. This is the #1 issue we have today.

Apart from the issue of corporations buying all the worlds fresh water the one part that stood out for me is where Nestle was allowed to go into Michigan, use up 200/gallons of water a minute to be used on bottled water to be shipped out of state. How can it be allowed for a private company to purchase the rights to consume massive amounts of water and then take it out of state?.  What happens when the water is gone?  Farewell MI and thanks for all the fish..

There will be wars fought in the future over water. There is no doubt about that. I think even within the US there are going to be more tensions between states.

How are corporations going to restrict water in the future?  How long before the first arrest and prosecution is made for someone stealing water..

3702489,3,B001MWGZ6S,"The narrative in this movie seems similar to others like Food Inc. or The Corporation.

There are greedy, manipulative corporations that exploit common resources that are human rights. I think that drastically oversimplifies the nature of the problem. Water distribution problems in the developing world have been a problem for decades. A number of early development projects modeled distribution systems after systems in Western cities simply because it was top down planning that didn't account for demand and how it manifests itself at the bottom.

Other than that, a number of developing countries have heavily subsidized water rates under public utilities to find that infrastructure breaks down and the utilities have neither the resources or incentive to repair, expand, or improve it. Also, instead of the poor benefiting from subsidies, it tends to be the middle class, especially in urban areas, that benefit from heavily subsidized water. To solve this problem, most mainstream academics seem fixated on finding models that help them ""target"" poor and deserving populations for subsidies with limited success. Then there are other interesting developments in places like Dakar, where people water supply siphon it off to neighbors who might reside in poorer areas that weren't planned (shanty towns). It's not ideal, but seems to work better than most places because there is a system of accountability. Price, while inherently unfair and discriminatory can also work to excess use of limited resources.

I have no love for Transnational corporations, but the market economy has some part to play in water distribution from a sustainability stand point. Establishing water as a right in some UN treaty will be as effective as most other UN treaties ... which typically don't do squat. I think the Alaskan guy in the film is right, some hyrid of government and private companies probably the best solution and will vary depending on socio-economic, political, and geographic context. I find it interesting they want to entrust government with water, when most developing countries don't have effective institutions to work on the public behalf.

As a final note, I don't trust the prescriptions of academics that have never had to produce anything with a bottom line. It seems like they(academics) continue to chase the myth of the ""people"", how they will rise up, and the wisdom of their proxies in government. If you look into it, Tony Clark, the co-author for the book, doesn't have any credentials in environmental studies or policy. He has a PHD in religion and most of his work is activism against FTAs. I'm not saying he doesn't have anything to contribute, but maybe he should identify that he speaks from a certain viewpoint. Example, ""Hey, I'm not a big free trade fan and kind of dig Latin American Liberation Theology, so there.""

Examines pollution, portrays Coke as a villain (?) and mentions bottling as well as efforts to privatize water and that wars have/will be fought over water as it will be the next precious fluid after...OIL! Please use judicially. Thank YOU! Also see 'Quantum of Solace'.",1492905600,,623,4.5625

8322287,5,B001MWGZ6S,I had to watch this movie/documentary for one of my college classes and was so not looking forward to it. I started watching it and was pleasantly surprised. I ended up watching it twice. I loved the content and what they talked about the water wars. I didn't even know that there was such a thing and could say that I learned something new. I recommend that everyone watch it and learn something new or more about the water wars in the world.,1485648000,2,443,4.349397590361446

There's a better documentary out there, but I {obviously} can't remember the right title name.  :)",1473638400,,268,4.408163265306122
