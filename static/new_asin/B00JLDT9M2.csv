6378163,4,B00JLDT9M2,"Since I grew up near Ocean City, MD, I enjoyed much of the scenery.  The story line is similar to Karate Kid, except the game is ping pong.  This is a movie all members of the family can see.  It's nice to see a movie with no cursing or sex for a change, and no one was murdered.  It's just a feel good, happy ending, relax and enjoy type of movie.",1402531200,,348,3.859154929577465

6378165,5,B00JLDT9M2,"Ping Pong Summer may have what seems like the simple premise of Boy Meets Bully, Boy Fights Bully in A Sport, but this movie manages to capture the spirit of 80s movies like the Karate Kid perfectly while cramming in enough 80s aesthetics, music, and food to make even the most retrophiliac happy. It has pretty big 80s names attached to it, such as Lea Thomspon and Susan Sarandon, and they both deliver as they always have. Theres some new talent in this movie as well, and Marcello Conte manages to capture all the awkwardness of being a 13-year old boy on a summer vacation with your parents. Its a fun movie, bright and colorful as you would expect, giving you a peek into Ocean City at its most radical.",1402272000,4,709,4.461538461538462
6378166,4,B00JLDT9M2,"So I'm from Maryland, not too far from where the writer/director grew up.  I have been to Ocean City, MD plenty of times, in the 1980's amd I loved hip-hop when it was called rap in the 1980's.  I can really appreciate what the director attempted and mostly sucdeeded in doing here which is not to create a movie clearly made in one time, looking back on another, but instead a movie that looks and feels like it cam directly from the 1980's.

The acting is not as engaging as the movie The Way, Way Back or Adventureland but what it lacks from some of it's actors it gets right in feel and a real understanding of the time.  This really deserves a rental from you if you experienced that time as a young person or teenager and wouldn't mind going back to visit for a while.",1402012800,10,774,4.244897959183674
6378167,4,B00JLDT9M2,"I really love the 80s nostalgia in Ping Pong Summer, even though I didn't grow up during that time. The young teenagers really made this film relatable  Rad and his best friend Teddy are awkward and charming, and I couldn't help but think of how I used to act when I was their age. Seeing how Rads crush on Stacy played out definitely reminded me of my first romantic experiences! Susan Sarandons character was by far my favorite, though. She plays Randi, Rads ping-pong mentor, but even more than that, she teaches him confidence and the importance of standing up for yourself. Overall, Ping Pong Summer is an entertaining film, and I really enjoyed seeing these young characters during their coming-of-age. I definitely recommend it as a lighthearted and fun summer movie!",1402012800,3,774,4.863636363636363
6378168,2,B00JLDT9M2,"Ping Pong Summer should be the kind of sweetly nostalgic comedy that a guy like me would love for a couple of reasons. Having grown up a child of the '80s, there's a twang of recognition at the mere mention of old school rap groups like The Fat Boys, or downing tons of Pixie Sticks with my friends until we were high as a rocket. Plus, being a child of the DMV I'm familiar with Ocean City, MD where writer/director Michael Tully has set his film and clearly has tons of his own childhood memories. And perhaps that is the problem, as Tully goes so far down the retro rabbit hole there isn't the barest hint of an engaging story.

Essentially what Tully is trying to do here is recreate the classic 1980s ""against all odds"" Karate Kid scenario, where the geeky kid defeats the bully using a skill he never knew he had. In this case it's ping pong, naturally, but the film isn't remotely interested in this triumphant underdog scenario until we've heard our millionth unnecessary turntable scratch (because turntables are uniquely '80s somehow?), and by then we're far beyond caring. Set in 1985 although the references freely bounce around the decade, the story centers on Rad (newcomer Marcello Conte), a stereotypical dork on vacation with his family (John Hannah and Lea Thompson are his parents) in Ocean City. Rad loves hip-hop and breakdancing, although he's terribly goofy-looking while doing it. He's too innocent and naive to notice or care, but that obliviousness extends to his new best friend, the jeri-curled beatboxin' Teddy Fryy (Myles Massey). Of course there's a troubled hot chick, Stacy Summers (Emmi Shockley), who has a jealous ex-boyfriend in Lyle (Joseph McCaughtry), a guy who might as well have on a Cobra Kai t-shirt.

It's easy to see that Tully is intentionally aiming to be a totally formulaic comedy here, going so far as to include Susan Sarandon in the Mr. Miyagi role. She plays Randi Jammer, the town pariah who helps train Rad for a ping pong match against Lyle to win Stacy's heart. One would think with Sarandon clearly the film's biggest name there would be more scenes with her, however she seems to be just passing through. There's also a significant disconnect in the approaches taken by Tully and the cast. While he litters every scene with as many self-referential cultural touchstones as possible: bad hair, cassette tapes, hot pink; the actors play their characters straight up and without parody. It's tough to figure if Tully is in love with the era or trying to mock it. An ""afterschool special"" storyline involving Stacy's addiction to Fun Punch, a Bug Juice-like concoction of Icee, Pixie Sticks, and Pop Rocks would suggest Tully is having fun with the overzealous ""Say No to Drugs"" campaign, but in other places there's a reluctance to go beyond surface nostalgia.

Performances are earnest and somewhat endearing, especially Conte as the story's clueless hero. Period details are on-point in only the most superficial way, unlike a similar film like Adventureland which truly feels of the era. Ping Pong Summer wants to be like the kind of movie you'd have bought a ticket for in the '80s, but it's closer to the kind of film you wish had stayed in the past where it belongs.",1401580800,3,3229,4.803956834532374

I understand the director trying to make a movie about the 80s that seemed to be filmed in the 80s, but this was just all around bad!
the acting was horrible, even the known stars in the film seemed not to have ever been in a film or on tv before. Where did they find these kids to be in the movie, it was like watching a bad school play. the cinematography was so bad, mainly made of closes ups of the actors face as they walked through OC. Maybe this was to hide the changes of OC through the years. Even the Cinderella theme of the movie never really hit its mark..

But it's very curious to see solid professional actors (like Susan Sarandon) mixed with obviously amateur and not-very-talented actors in the same movie.  The best scene is the one with the aunt and uncle.  Other than that, nothing memorable other than the scenery, and a very predictable and unexciting story line.

6378270,3,B00JLDT9M2,"This movie is about Ping Pong which I love, Ocean City which I love, takes place in 1985 which is one of my favorite years and has one of my favorite actresses - Susan Sarandon. I should love this movie but I just couldn't get into it. The best part was seeing the places in Ocean City and saying ""I've been there"" or noting what looks the same as it really did in 1985 or the things that look different than they really did back then.

The script wasn't all that great; the acting was fair but the movie seemed to drag on well beyond it's 92 minute running time. If you love OC and want to see the movie for that reason, I'd recommend it. But if you are looking for something more this might not be the right choice.",1437696000,,717,4.085106382978723

6378274,2,B00JLDT9M2,"I'm being generous with this rating only because I'm from Maryland and was about this kid's age in 1985 (the setting for this film). The comedic timing for this movie was nearly non-existent. But the characters were likable. A lot of the Maryland references were really great. Stuff you'd only understand if you spent time in OC was true - the drunk guy hanging over the apartment railing, the restaurants they went to, kids complaining about being bayside vs ocean side, Anthony's liquor store, weird surfer guys jumping fences to take a dip in motel pools, telescope photos on the beach... So I enjoyed it for all that, and the story was good, but things could've been done better. It was like this movie was trying to be another Napoleon Dynamite but it didn't really come through that way. And things needed to be more dramatic re: Susan Sarandon's character. That was a missed opportunity. Another missed opportunity was the kid burning his face. That was potentially a funny event that was just presented as matter-of-fact and then it disappeared. If this happens to be the writer or director's first film, though, good job. I'm happy they picked a Maryland setting.",1434672000,2,1172,4.835820895522388

6378315,5,B00JLDT9M2,"Writer/director Michael Tullys last film was 2011s bizarre comedy ""Septien,"" and maybe being familiar with that film helps make sense of his follow-up, ""Ping Pong Summer."" Even more than ""Wet Hot American Summer,"" this film feels like something that could have actually been *made* in the 80s, but Tullys focus on unique, realistic characters sets it apart from straight parody. Newcomer Marcello Conte is fantastically awkward in the lead role of Rad Miracle (!), but Myles Massey totally steals the show as Teddy, Rads new best friend for the summer. The film evokes the weirdness and discomfort of being a teenager on extended family vacation perfectly, following Rad as he hangs out with Teddy at the local arcade (The Fun Hub) and makes an enemy of a local rich kid, but also spending a lot of time with Rads familyincluding a visit to Rads beach bum aunt and uncle played by Amy Sedaris and Robert Longstreet thats as creepy as it is funny. If you're expecting a straightforward parody of 80s teen movie tropes, you're probably going to be utterly perplexed.

6378316,3,B00JLDT9M2,"Watched this with my 14 year old son and we had a few chuckles mostly because it is rather cheesy and probably intentionally so.  I was 14 in the summer of 1985 which is when this movie takes place so we had some back-in-the-day bonding.  Yes, it's a little bit like The Way Way Back (highly recommended) and a little bit like Karate Kid (must see classic) but doesn't come close to being as good as either. Nothing much happens in this movie other than the ping pong challenge. Very slow going with little plot other than the bullying by the rich kids and towards the end the crazy neighbor steps into the Mr. Miyagi role. This is not rated and has a little bit of language and some borderline innuendo but I thought would be OK for a tween as well, 11/12 & up.  Not very clear if the girl who plays a minimal romantic interest is really putting cocaine in her Icees or it's just the pixie stick sugar for an extra buzz, so she claims.

Now I love to stay on the Bayside when we vacation in OC MD... but now I rent a nice place on the Bayfront at the Inlet! with fab views and close to the best of the world famous Boardwalk. The movie has a few scenes from Trimper's Rides which is on Worcester Street. This makes the movie more endearing to me because that is the same street that we stay on (in Assateague House).  I also love the characters in this movie... the awkward teenage boys (we have all been there), the weird relatives (every family has some), and the mean neighbor (Susan Sarandon) who turns out not to be so mean.

This movie played like a home movie filmed inside my memories of 1984-1986. No part of this movie knowingly pokes fun at the 80s. There is no winking at the camera or mugging it up for the audience.

I read an article that said Ocean City, MD, the beachside tourist community in which this film is based, has not changed much since the 1980s. This would partially explain why the director, cast and crew have managed to capture the feel of that decade on a limited budget. It reminds me of a deliberately campier version of ""The Way, Way Back"" -- everything about the movie is deliberate, and that's why it succeeds. If it tried to be heavy-handed and poignant, one might see right through it. But it's hard to be dismissive about a movie that loves its era so much that it exacerbates some of the goofiest parts about it in order to further endear to that time and this particular place. It really made me want to visit Ocean City (we have a town like it where I am originally from called Seaside, OR) and blast New Edition on my car stereo. They are selling the soundtrack to the film on cassette tape on their website; that's how dedicate they are to this craft of nostalgia. Buy this movie if you love the 80s and coming of ages stories.

6378378,5,B00JLDT9M2,"With its effective use of Karate Kid tropes and 80s memorabilia, Ping Pong Summer is a worthy homage to classic 80s coming of age comedies. The film makes great use of its 80s stars Lea Thompson and Susan Sarandon plus revealed the rising talent in Marcello Conte.  Contes laugh-out-loud performance made me relive the cringe-worthy horror of my teenage life despite my not being an 80s baby. In addition, Susan Sarandons Miyagi character was a delightful surprise for the Karate Kid fan in me. She not only channeled her best Pat Morita, but made the character her own with a delightful quirkiness. With its talented cast and fun characters, Ping Pong Summer is one of my all-time favorite summer films.

6378409,3,B00JLDT9M2,"While the story was simple, unoriginal but cute, the acting talent ran from bad to adequate.  I did enjoy the guy who played Rad's dad.  As a veteran OC vacationer, It was fun recognizing the different locations, the Thrashers french fry bucket, Dumser's Dairyland custard.  There were a lot of ""inside"" jokes and if you are not familiar with the DelMarVa area, you probably didn't even know they were supposed to be funny (Like Amy Sedaris' comment about her seashell sculptures selling well at Rehoboth[Beach, Delaware-- a smaller beach town north of OCMD]).  Was there ever really an arcade in the back of Anthony's?  I don't recall ever seeing any other kids walking around with ping-pong paddles. Lastly, as a former Marylander (grew up in MD) and veteran OC vacationer (still visit every few years), I felt like the movie was not too complimentary to townies or vacationers.  It really made the people who live in and visit OC look like a bunch of goofballs with various mental and physical maladies.  It looked downright clinically aberrant!  OC is a loud and fun family destination with a beautiful beach and a boardwalk second to none (arguably)  on the mid-Atlantic coast!  Much better things to do than play ping-pong!",1403481600,,1229,4.893719806763285
6378410,3,B00JLDT9M2,"""Saturday, one game, no excuses."" During the summer of 1985 Rad Miracle (Conte) is on a vacation with his parents that he isn't happy about. There is only one thing that keeps him going, hip hop dancing. When he starts to explore his summer home he finds a new best friend, his first crush, bullies and a wacky local who is more then meets the eye. For a long time now I have maintained that when one idea hits it gets copied over and over until it ruins the idea. Examples are disaster movies, gladiator movies, teens having to save the world (Twilight, Hunger Games, Divergent, etc...). This one continues a trend of the outcast kid who discovers himself over the summer that started with The Way Way Back. Having said that there really isn't much else to talk about other then this one also has a little Karate Kid mixed in. I did like it, don't get me wrong, but I also feel like it's time for a new idea. Overall, a good movie but a theme that is starting to become to repetitious for it to have any real impact anymore. I give it a B.",1403395200,,1040,4.257575757575758

Sadly, we made it about 30 minutes in before we looked at each other and laughed at the total corniness of it and said enough is enough.  I'm not going to pick it apart - I will just say that if you really want to see it because you love Ocean City, wait for it to come out on Red Box and save the $6.99 (RIDICULOUS) for something better.",1403395200,3,434,3.9204545454545454

6378413,4,B00JLDT9M2,"I just watched Ping Pong Summer and I must say, it is hilarious! I loved that Rad saw himself as being able to break dance and beat box when in reality he was just terrible at it. It made me think of when I was that age. I thought I was all that. I especially enjoyed the 80s style of the movie. It was so nostalgic of that time and it sort of paid homage to the classic films of the 1980s. I would have loved to see more of Susan Sarandon in the film, but her role was great and her acting was on point (I mean, what else would you expect?). The movie is a lot of fun and I definitely want it as part of my movie collection some day.",1402963200,,634,3.774436090225564
6378414,4,B00JLDT9M2,"Ping Pong Summer is a teen movie that the entire family can enjoy. Although the film focuses on Marcello Contes character, Rad Miracle, and his family vacation to Ocean City, Maryland, there are plenty of subtexts and commentary to pick up on. Such as, Rads journey of self-realization, while battling the awkwardness of puberty. Like any 80s movie, the film is filled with tons of pop-culture references and old school hip-hop, which will send you down memory lane. If they setting and theme of the film aren't enough to get you thinking about your first kiss or your first zit, then Susan Sarandon and John Hannahs outstanding supporting roles will surely give parents something to look forward to. I would recommend this film to anyone who is looking for something fun and entertaining to watch this summer.",1402963200,,810,4.91970802919708

Sure this movie might be a little over the top,  with Susan Sarandon as the Mr. Miagi of Ping Pong and the nemesis as the prototype as the all American 80's bad-guy, but you know what? That's the point. It's a movie from the 80's rereleased into the 2010's. And you know what? I loved it. Something about getting slushies at a gas station and pixie sticks just makes me happy.

Great characters, hilarious and witty moments, rad 80s music - it made me nostalgic for a time that was before I was even born.
This movie is just an all around good time, and clean enough for the whole family without being too childish.
It will make you long for days of summers past and make you wish that you too could have Susan Sarandon as your ping pong coach.
I'd really recommend this movie to anyone! It has lovable characters (and some you'll love to hate), a hilarious family dynamic, and beautifully captures those long summer days and innocent first loves.
Now what are you waiting for? Stop reading this review and go watch it already! You won't regret it.

8652120,5,B00JLDT9M2,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to the protagonist so much (despite being much older, haha).  Also loved how it was set and filmed in Ocean City, Maryland.  Plus set in the 80s.  Since my family used to go there back then in happier times.  I was more into ""80s rock"" (remember all the hair? lol) than rap at the time, I'm willing to admit, but yeah, great movie that celebrates just staying true to yourself, regardless of what other people think.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,,1509,4.585820895522388
