4639430,1,B005A5YYKC,"THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT HOME VIDEO RELEASE EVER. History will view this as a turning point: Civilization before the Transformers box set was released and civilization after. At long last, two of the worst movies ever made are now bundled with a third, somewhat less awful movie! If you're anything like me, you've been chomping at the bit to relive the insanity, the incoherence, and most of all the indulgence that is the Transformers trilogy, and now you can whenever you want in the comfort of your own home! Who can forget John Turturro's terrible turn as whatever his awful character's name was? Or Ken Jeong turning in one of the worst performances anyone will ever see? Or the most blatant disregard for storytelling ever seen in blockbusters? Or the infinite amounts of awful humor that makes me never want to laugh again? Robot Heaven? The Twins? Important lore somehow inscribed on Shia's grandpa's glasses? Optimus Prime being caught in wires for 17 minutes of screen time? CLASSIC stuff!

All of your basic needs are now provided for, and it's all thanks to this great set! It's inevitable success doesn't prove ANYTHING terrible about humanity at all!",1324166400,62,1167,4.893939393939394

What I really enjoyed about this film What the sequels lack , is it was a Thriller much like Bays Previous Film The Island sure it did have explosions and Bayhumor but it really was fined tuned film , The U.S. Government and Military are caught off guard by The Presence of Both The Autobots and Decepticons Little is Know That both are looking for a Lost Relic from There now Destroyed Planet of Cybertron both have become Splinter Factions Leading to A Robot Civil War which Earth Happens to be a Battleground. really enjoyed the relationship between Sam and Bumblebee much like Elliot and E.T.'s relationship also it was thrilling because everyone was after the All Spark also Really Enjoyed The Return of Peter Cullen back as Optimus Prime .

My only complaint of this item would be the special features. To make the item so cheap, they basically took out all of the disc ones of the single movies and put them into this trilogy set. This is fine if you are one to just watch the movies and pay no attention to the specials, but to me I would at least like to know what came to making the films.

4639858,4,B005A5YYKC,"I'm being honest when I say that I bought this set solely for technical reasons because the storyline for any of the three films that you select are blah at best. The discs look and sound pretty fantastic, especially Dark of the Moon which is the only one of the three that has a full on Dolby Digital True HD 7.1 mix. While the third film sounds the best, the other two really aren't far behind in that respect. The video transfers are nice and clear but truth be told, it doesn't really help in making the action in the first two films any more discernible. The third film takes a different approach to its action scenes and you can actually tell what's going on in them as opposed to the first two films action scenes, which are the equivalent of an overactive kid repeatedly smashing two Transformers action figures inches from your face.

The set is bare bones in terms of extras, save for the first film which has some featurettes and stuff. All in all, the presentation of the films is great and pure eye/ear candy so on that end, the set gets good marks technically but the lack of plots that make any kind of sense in any of the films hurts it a bit. If you're a die hard Michael Bay/ Transformers fan, you may want to find another set that contains more extras than this one because again, you're really just getting the films here. But if the films are all you want and you want them on Blu Ray, this is the best, most cost effective way to go.",1399248000,,1455,4.290909090909091

It appears that there is no mentioning of a boxed set in the description, but it seems misleading to say that all three movies are included, yet without it being a boxed set. So if you are looking for a movie case shaped like Optimus Prime's head then this will disappoint you. If you just want the movies, then this will be just fine. I was expecting the boxed set, but as I am not a ""bonus features kinda guy"" I got over it quickly. Just the perk of the artwork and a classy box would have been nice. I mean the back of this cardboard sleeve (big enough to fit three blu-ray boxes in) had pictures of the covers of the three boxes the movies come in! That was it. Not even scenes from the movies. Not only that, but the discs all read ""Disc 1 Feature Film."" There is only one disc per movie in this set! So they just took the blu-ray disc from previous releases (ie, the 20$ per movie releases likely) and stuck it in here without giving this set anything unique. This trilogy is really just the movies and nothing more. If that's what you want, you'll be happy. If not, you'll soon learn to be happy with it because the movies for this price as a trilogy is a pretty sweet deal.

I love blu-ray movies its better on the eyes.  The sound is outstanding & clear
I say to you please Learn how to adjust the sound volume for your area / room that best fit you.
The sound is off the chain comming from 5.1 or 7.1 system. The 3.1/ 4.1 system are still good

I was hoping that they would all be at least 2 disc versions. I will hold on to this set for now until they come out with a set that has ""Dark Side of the Moon"" in 3D.

4640212,3,B005A5YYKC,"Okay, seriously, this has to stop. This ""movie set"" is ONLY that. The barest of bare releases of all 3 movies. No special features to speak of. Okay, in theory there's a commentary track on disc one and maybe some trailers available after film? But that's about it.

Considering I already had the SE DVD versions, I consider this set to be an utter and complete RIPOFF. There, I said it.

BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE until the studio(s) gets the message. We hate it when they half-ass releases and we hate being double dipped. If I'm spending beaucoup $$ to get a COMPLETE set, I want the set to be COMPLETE, not to have to REPURCHASE it again in 6 mos when the get off their handquarters and finally decide to release the ACTUAL complete series set they should have released the first time around.

As a fan, and as a collector of movies, I find this thoroughly distasteful.

I had precisely the same problem with the release of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-High-Definition-Trilogy/dp/B000UR9T82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man: High Definition Trilogy</a>&nbsp;set, where the ""upgrade"" to Blu-Ray was actually a ""downgrade"" to zero special features (despite having already bought all the SE DVDs). That the studios DECIDED to include only the bare version of the first two movies and the SE of the 3rd didn't speak well of that set either.

On the other hand, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Matrix-Collection/dp/B000OPPBEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Matrix Collection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-Anthology/dp/B00938UVC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator Anthology</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Resident-Evil-Collection/dp/B008J56GVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Resident Evil Collection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld-The-Legacy-Collection/dp/B007FFUMKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld: The Legacy Collection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riddick-Collection/dp/B004GSVX5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riddick Collection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Austin-Powers-Collection/dp/B001EN71HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Austin Powers Collection</a>&nbsp;were how ""complete collections"" SHOULD be released... All were quite good & feature complete!

As fans and collectors, we expect more of studios. That is to say, if a SE has already been put out, the ""features"" from the SE should make it into the ""collection"" set(s) rather than being completely left out. Either that or they should be EXTREMELY CLEAR that they are releasing ""bare"" / ""movie-only"" editions and will be releasing ""ultimate"" editions later. Yes, they'll score fewer sales up front by labeling as ""movie-only"" editions. But, that's AS IT SHOULD BE. Those who WANT FEATURES will be [somewhat] happier knowing exactly what they WON'T be getting so they can avoid sub-par releases and hold out for ""complete"" releases rather than buying the ""set"" only to find out upon getting it home that it's completely not even close to what they were expecting.

So, I'll simply say of this set: the picture and sound are great. The features... WHAT FEATURES? Effectively, there are none... If you've already bought the special edition DVDs or Blu, don't both with this set. Avoid it. Wait for the ""ultimate edition"" that will no doubt come out later. Thus avoid being double and triple dipped... (We're not ice cream cones. We're fans and collectors and we expect better treatment...) So, 3 points for video & sound, docked 2 points for complete lack of features.

All that said, there was apparently once a Transformers Limited Edition Collector's Trilogy. However, the LE packaging looked a bit unwieldy and it appears to now be discontinued w/o a replacement as yet.

I'd suggest waiting for a ""repack"" of that set (likely in a more standard case, just with the same ""SE"" discs)...

Until then, caveat emptor. Buyer beware. *This* set is NOT the compact 'ultimate edition' fans are probably hoping for...",1351900800,16,5241,7.2784810126582276

It was cool that they got the same guy to do the voice of Optimus that di it in the original cartoon too...cool that he's still around.  I think one or two of the others may have had the same voicework too, but not entirely sure.

Anyway, though I thought perhaps maybe a few things could have been done better throughout the course of the 2nd & 3rd films, I felt none the less that they were awesome and action packed, with a good amount of appropriate humor mixed in throughout them as well.  I own each movie on DVD, but I'm thinking about upgrading them to this Blu-Ray box set sometime soon, so as to get the full high def experience on them, because these are some of the kinds of movies that I like to have in high def because action packed movies like this sound the best...and these types of movies are also my favorite types of movies, other than comedies & certain family movies, but I'm content just getting DVDs of those types of movies.

There is no questioning the worth of the Transformer film series. Top notch CGI with crazy virtual stunts and amazing articulation of the title characters. Sure, the acting is a 'little shoddy' some times, but we're not all really watching these for Shia. We've been here because we remember the old school Bumblebee (not that he isn't a bazillion times cooler now). We've been here because Peter Cullen has voiced Optimus since we were in grade school. These movies stretch thin the line of the nonsensical, but we keep coming back because giant robots rock (even if Hugh Jackman let us down just a wee bit).

So, in the end, if you just want the films with no frills at all, then this is an epic movie set designed just for you. We the fans are left wanting, and we shall continue to mourn until the folk upstairs get with the program. Epic movies should have a modicum of special features regardless of everything else.

The whole box is shipped exceptionally by amazon probably the best packaging I have ever seen by them rest assured there will be no damage during shipping.

I was really seriously considering on getting this collector's item as I am a huge TF fan but holding off and reading back in December that Bay is in talks with the producers, Hasbro and Paramount for a possible fourth installment is now coming in to fruitation.

The only negative thing I have to say is about the movies themselves, not the box set itself. I am not a huge fan of the whole love story dilemma that was woven into each movie. I haven't read any of the comics, so I don't know how well the movies follow the comics, but I just felt that the movies should have been less about the teen love story and more about the transformers story. All in all, I was very satisfied with this trilogy pack because I got all three movies in one box set, for one low price. If you have never seen the movies, or have missed one in the series, I suggest getting this set so you can watch the series from beginning to end.

the movies look great, lots of great cgi and some very funny moments. though I will say that especially for the 2nd and third movie the 1st act is very slow and uninteresting but they pick up in the 2nd act to a crescendo in the 3rd act. the first two movies are great for kids and adults alike though the third I would not recommend (more than a few panty shots and an honestly shocking scene where people get vaporized on camera with the only thing left behind being shreds of clothing and bones which completely came out of nowhere for me. they also added blood to the robots for the third movie and the general theme is just a whole lot darker (it honestly surprised me that hasbro allowed them to push it that far)

still they're amazing films, and definitely worth watching (though one caveat for the third film though,there's a scene on the highway that...doesn't look right. like the quality just drops for the scene, the backgrounds get kinda fuzzy compared to the crispness of the rest of the film and the cgi just looks very budget compared to the rest (like they were in a rush just for this scene) not sure if it's just me or not but I thought I'd put it in here) and for the price it's a really sweet deal!

No just that, IF there were indeed only 5,000 Box sets made, they must've come with a certificate of authenticity or at least something that said ""copy 1,500 of 5,000"" for example. None of that came with it. Another thing about the ""signature"", according to Michael Bay himself on this video: [...] he says he ""signed"" all 5,000 of them.

I thought it was a bad connection first but, NOPE. i rewound it to check it was a glitch or something but, NOPE AGAIN! it was the blu ray itself. I was wowed again at HOW CRAPPY the quality had gotten and also made me more pissed was that i paid $45 for this, not the price offered here.

Also, there was no 2nd disc with my ""movie set"" just the same as everyone is complaining about. (Disc 1 and no disc 2 included) Especially for the price i paid, i knew i had to write a review.

4640401,1,B005A5YYKC,"...Terrible, overrated, insipid, uninspired, atrociously acted, poorly written, banal, MESSES.
I pity whoever is sucked into buying this blatant cash grab.
 The general population likes mindless popcorn flicks from the likes of directors such as Micheal Bay because all they provide are fancy eye candy and don`t require people to use a single brain cell. Nothing original or anything particularly interesting here. Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox are two of the worst ""actors"" I have ever witnessed and provide absolutely nothing in a film that is supposed to be about TRANSFORMERS. I mean, that`s the title of the franchise, correct? For a franchise that is based off such good source material with giant robots fighting a war, why did a good hour and a half of every film focus on two inexperienced actors that represent two characters which mean absolutely nothing to the story? I realize that films like these have to have some sort of ""romance"" or ""human element"" to keep it from being too far-fetched and to keep the ladies interested, but it was really unnecessary when you consider the fact that the franchise is called ""TRANSFORMERS"", not ""HUMANS"".
As for the first film, I enjoyed it to a point, but found myself laughing at unintentionally funny bits, and the last two were just plain terrible.

One more thing, before you start a pointless flame war, all the critics who actually know their films said the exact same thing. Hundreds of them. I review films and have loved cinema all my life, only to watch this franchise as well as others steal the spotlight from films and franchises that actually DESERVE the fame.

4640418,2,B005A5YYKC,"So tempted to give the trilogy packaging 1 star...
Each of the blu-ray movie packages are 1 disc. The first two movies 1st discs both say ""Disc 1 Feature Film"" so where's Disc 2?
A special feature on the Transformers blu-ray called h.u.d. (heads up display = trivia information) mentions ""See Disc 2 for more information on primacord"".  Where's Disc 2?
There is ""bd live"" functionality which allows access to other special features if you have internet access.
Still, the question about the h.u.d. where it said ""See Disc 2 for more information on primacord"".  I haven't watched all of the items on bd live, but couldn't they have changed that quote on h.u.d. to say ""See 'bd live docummentary [entitled...]' for more information on primacord"" if it is available live?
I remember on the DVD there was a deleted scene at a pawn shop in Mission City where the walkie-talkies where purchased.  The ""bd live"" has two deleted scenes, neither of which are the one at the pawn shop.  They didn't think we'd miss it I guess.
At this point, I'm still feeling like somethings missing.

I enjoy special features.  If I knew this trilogy did not contain all of the material (2nd disks), I would not have bought it.
On Transformers: Dark of the Moon blu-ray included in the trilogy, you can change to various subtitles and you can change the audio settings, that's it. There are no commentaries, ""bd live"" or any other special features. Booo",1326412800,57,1428,4.714859437751004

4640442,5,B005A5YYKC,"Transformers Trilogy is an amazing thrill ride from start to finish! You get 3 of the best action packed movies made that will please any true transformer fan. I have been a transformer fan since the beginning in the 1980's and have loved every single minute of all three movies done. All three have very good storylines with well placed action scenes mixed with some comedy&romance for 3 great quality movies. The first movie is an introduction to the transformers like Optimus,Bumblebee,Megatron,and Starscream for example while setting up the base storyline of the battle between the autobots and decepticons. In the Revenge of the Fallen you get the continuing romance between Sam and Mikaela while some new transformers are introduced into the series with a compelling plot by a new decepticon that concerns a natural resource. Revenge Of The Fallen is an awesome all around sequel that is as good as both of the other films with just as many amazing special effects. Dark of The Moon is probably the best in the set with the most intricate storyline and the most action from start to finish. Sam gets a new girlfriend in Carly and finds himself in the middle of the decepticon autobot war again,but is more battle ready from his previous experiences. The moon holds a secret that sets up the movie storyline along with a decepticon plot. If you like transformers you will love this trilogy set.
