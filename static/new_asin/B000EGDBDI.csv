2517519,4,B000EGDBDI,"A movie is a funny story of a grown-up loser reaching the stars while in a boring job on the Earth.

Perhaps, depicting a realistic role the USSR played in star exploration does not add stars from English-speaking viewers.",1247097600,,222,4.6923076923076925
2517520,5,B000EGDBDI,"This movie is a gem.  Almost flawless, you can feel that every detail has been tended to.  From a great arm's length (the universe), it asks what we're meant to be doing on this ball that goes round and round. The cinematography constantly surprises, like stills in a photgraphic exhibit, and the score compliments beautifully. In the end, LePage concludes, all we have is art and poetry and love; these transcend the things that threaten to make us crazy.",1174608000,7,456,4.7594936708860756
2517521,5,B000EGDBDI,"Let me first clarify that I am not francophone or the kind of person who watches artistic movies.  Yet, this movie totally absorbed me and took me to a tremendous emotional and visual trip.

I do not want to say much about this simple looking and yet intrically woven movie involving space travel, personal alienation, family love, dejection, and alien messages and yet full of humanity.

I am speechless.",1158019200,5,405,4.840579710144928

8109068,5,B000EGDBDI,"This symbolic masterpiece by Canadian Le Page portrays two brothers who have developed in opposite directions. Phillipe's shy, introverted, easily discouraged,struggling to pass his dissertation requirements. Andre in contrast is a TV weatherman who likes being the boss, and who has no qualms about lying for the sake of his own self-aggrandizement or comfort. As the story progresses, the brothers begin to meet in the middle. The ""far side of the moon"" is a great metaphor for our shadow side, a fairly well known term of Jung's. The moon is always showing one side to the Earth, for it rotates along with us, seemingly wanting to hide its other side. Just so is the human personality. Andre is Phillipe's shadow, and vice versa.

The complexity of LePage's story keeps folks entertained even if they don't know symbolic language, but if you do, such an exquisite level os mastery is here! Along with the brothers' tales of realization and transformation, FSOTM gives us the metaphorically fun theme of Phillipe's love of the Russian-American space race, his dissertation subject. Mom figures somewhat prominently, a gentle presence, mute and smiling, whose death, the greatest of transformations, is the event that precedes her sons' transformations. LePage uses the filmmaker-within-the-film device, as Philippe spends time filming his own life for broadcasting into outer space.

Woven with great wisdom, TFSOTM explores both the conditioning that takes place in childhood, and the yearning to move beyond human limitations, the desire to experience life beyond personality and embodiment. I published a review of this film in my e book, Poetry in Motion, linked here.  It's a symbolic review; I interpret the symbolism.

Constipation of self-indulgence.
No, that's too glorious.
How about: Anything to put bread on the table.
WAY too many people selling ... well, garbage or feces, and expecting to get away with it.
Spend your time doing something valuable. Read Andrew Breitbart's Righteous Indignation or better: an audio book.
Get a copy of the dvd: ""Occupy Unmasked"", an excellent ""thriller""! Fact more horrifying than fiction!
The Left and Anarchists are trashing this world; delivering it into the hands of fanatical Muslims (By definition, there can be no such thing as a moderate Muslim. They are required, by hook or crook, to obey leadership, PERIOD).
Yes, Darwin-fondlers, the strong will survive.
Sometimes the most devious (and evil) win: Bill Clinton, Hussein Obama, Democrats Gone Wild...
Get a grip, people.
FOR A DECENT bit of ""strange film"", watch Holy Motors or go back and watch Closely Watched Trains, ('66 Czech).",1390089600,,940,5.231788079470198
8109070,5,B000EGDBDI,"Robert Lepage conceived, wrote, directed, and starred as brothers in the stylistically brilliant ""Far Side of the Moon."" It was largely centered in Quebec City and is in French with excellent English subtitles. The themes of sibling rivalry, mortality, academic nightmares, and especially narcissism are front and center from very early on and are interwoven into a compelling film. The backdrop for the film is Philippe's (Lepage) obsession with the space race, which provides most of the very interesting linking devices. Philippe is attempting to obtain his Ph. D. in the Philosophy of Scientific Culture, and his frustrations in doing so are legion (particularly getting stood up by artist and cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, the first human to walk in space, and facing bitter failure on his first trip to Moscow.)

While Philippe is smart and deeply affected by the loss of his mother, his brother Andr (also Lepage) is a shallow newscaster who is so palpably irresponsible and narcissistic that he doesn't even want to take care of his deceased mother's goldfish even though it was the last living thing she had; self-absorption has rarely been this ugly. The writing is sublime and subtle turns of phrase are common (never has the line ""You can't always trust the weatherman"" been so double-edged, for instance.) Not only is Lepage's script perfect, the irony and timing throughout are stunning: look especially for the scene in which Andr interrupts ""Silent Night"" in his mother's nursing home.

While Philippe is in Moscow an ice storm with multiple significant results strikes Canada; I don't want to spoil this elegant piece of filmmaking, but I will say it is absolutely worth the wait. While ""Far Side of the Moon"" has many themes and messages, a loathing of narcissism and the hope of reconciliation tower over the rest. This is not a fast-paced film, but it is absolutely delightful, and I cannot recommend it more highly.",1386547200,,1931,5.0501567398119125

Extras include a cinematic trailer and a making of documentary ""The Creative Space of Robert Lepage."" Both are excellent, and the making of feature is especially enlightening. For once the discussion of CGI is actually interesting; the use of CGI helping the plot immeasurably in this instance.",1386547200,,2227,5.079234972677596
8109072,5,B000EGDBDI,"I originally saw this film at a film festival. It was a film I enjoyed as much as his first The Confessional. Sadly it was never given a cinema release here or released on dvd either so I was really pleased to see it available in the US.The film is fantastic ,based on the incredible play I saw Robert Lepage perform at the National Theatre.
It arrived safely and was very well protected for it's long journey from the States.
It is great to own a copy at such a reasonable price.........and enjoy the funny,yet eventually moving performances by LePage who plays two brothers in Quebec dealing with the aftermath of losing their mother,played out during the backdrop of the moon race.",1368576000,,684,4.614754098360656

8109074,5,B000EGDBDI,This movie is very well done - everything in it is there for a reason.  This is not an action film but a finely wrought character study  full of subtlety and wit.  It's one of the best movies I have ever seen.,1286150400,,209,3.9285714285714284
8109075,2,B000EGDBDI,"I have been a proud devotee of Lepage's stage work for years, all the way back to OTA. His recent DAMNATION OF FAUST at the Metropolitan Opera was an astounding marriage of music and technology.

But film just isn't Robert's best metier.

MOON is slow, even plodding, to the point when you want to just scream at the main character, ""Look, just get a life, okay?"" It's visually flat, which amazed me, considering how Lepage works the physical limits of the theatre.

And then there's that ending. Sorry, it felt forced and sloppy, as though Lepage had written himself into a serious corner and couldn't figure out how to get out of it. The result is a true what-the-hell? scene that seems only vaguely connected to anything even remotely part of the film's thematic worldview.

I don't know that I would say to avoid it. But it's really for Lepage fans, and even then, the most forgiving of them.",1251504000,,896,4.616352201257862
