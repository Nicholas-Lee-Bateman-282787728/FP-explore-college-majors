2511655,5,B000E9ZGSS,"The first time I ever heard of or saw The Happy Goodmans, Howard and Vestal, was on Gaither Concert Series.  This is a tribute to their 50 years marriage, music and ministry.  Host, Bill Gaither, calls them ""national treasures"" in Gospel Music.  They won two Grammys, and were inducted into the Gospel Hall of Fame in 1998.  The setting for this historic celebration is the Ryman Auditorium in Tennessee.

If you are new to the Gaither Concert Series, you will see much of the Goodmans singing in the front row.  Howard died in 2002 at 81 and Vestal was 74 when she died in 2003.

Some of their favorite people other than family who have joined them, include George Jones, Jessy Dixon, the Gaither Vocal Band, the Newsboys, etc.  You will learn more about this singing family, the kindness of the two and how much they are treasured.  George Jones tells how Vestal was an inspiration to him especially after his 1999 vehicle accident.  Bill Gaither shares his story of comfort by Vestal during his concern with a heart condition.

The special features include a music video Vestal, Andrae Crouch and the Katinas singing ""You're Able"", plus, the ""Angel Band"" video with George Jones.  Jessy Dixon, a pleasure to watch sings ""Leaving on My Mind"". And, Candy Christmas, with a beautiful song, ""Lord, Send Your Angels"".

This DVD is about a special family in Gospel Music, a tribute.  What better place to learn and appreciate the Goodmans, than with this wonderful DVD; its fun; it's personal and entertaining.
