8026476,4,B0002D68TC,"In this Volume 2 of  the 5 volume video series on Advanced Self-Defense Shooting skills,  Bill Wilson talks about and demonstrates good use of  taking cover to minimize one's self as a target while shooting from from what ever position one can get one's self into while behind cover.  He talks about and demonstrates things to do and things not to do to make good use of cover.  Bill Wilson talks about practicing marksmanship training as though  being in a real self-defense situation.  The idea is that just practicing target practice at stationary targets on a firing range from standard shooting stances without taking cover won't save a handgun owner against another handgun user in a gun fight.

Bill Wilson talks a little about the common mistakes found in movies while actors take cover in movie gun fights and explains how doing those things will put you at a great disadvantage and get you killed in a real gun fight.  He demonstrates good principles to use to maximize your chances of surviving an exchange of gun fire while your behind cover.

Bill Wilson talks about how the use of aimed fire, flash sight picture shooting and point shooting differ in the degree of accurate shooting principles and how each type is associated with a range of distance from your adversary.

He talks a little about the difference in shooting one handed verses shooting with both hands on the pistol.

He talks about and demonstrates tactical reloading verses speed reloading and when and how you would do either type of reload.

Bill Wilson talks about and demonstrates how to train to progress from basic target shooting to smoother, faster accurate shooting practice for more realistic self-defense scenarios.  The video is 65 minutes long.
I think it's a good video for those serious about training to prepare for self-defense using a handgun.  Some of what Bill Wilson talks about and demonstrates is very similar to what is written in Gabriel Suarez's book, ""Tactical Pistol Marksmanship: How to Improve Your Combat Shooting Skills"".  So, if you liked reading that book, you might like watching some of those things being demonstrated.
