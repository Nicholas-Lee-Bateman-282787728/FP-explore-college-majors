4992306,3,B006IXRIKI,"Good movie, but the camera and direction needs work. Reagan Gomez is a great actress, but this movie wasn't as great as her other movies that I saw.",1337126400,,148,4.321428571428571
4992307,5,B006IXRIKI,"David Talbert!  Does it Again!  I love this play..... Like he said when he introduced it before it come on!....  IT WAS FUNNY!  I love me some Wesley Jonathan he is sooooooo fine!  I'm in love with them DIMPLES!  Chris Rock, Tico Wells and that Crazyyyyyyyyyy Lavelle Crawford they where too funny in this play... I LOVE POOKIE role in this play too... Just out of Rehab!...  This play is about a couple who faces the ups and downs in relationships.  The play was SERIOUS, FUNNY AND ROMANTIC!  If you love David Talbert's work then you would love this play!  Oscar Mayor Bacon My Brotha!  LMAO!  Check the Play Out!",1335225600,,615,4.490909090909091
4992308,4,B006IXRIKI,I really liked this play.  I was very funny and it did not include alot of singing like alot of black plays.  The plot of the play is all about what goes around comes back around.  i WOULD RECOMMENED THIS play to anyone looking for a laugh and a good play.,1333324800,,256,3.980392156862745
4992309,4,B006IXRIKI,"I love David E. Talbert, but this one was not as funny as he said it was.  A good play but some parts was too silly, over-done.  The fat guy mailman was not funny and I never liked him on standup comedy. He was not funny then, just too big.

I did not like the ending of the play when she was still mad with her cheating BF and he called her over to talk and had pastor et al there to propose 2 her and she said YES.

He still did not have a job,see a paycheck, pay a bill; he did not apology and suffer long enough. Marrying her then did not ensure that he would not cheat again. He did not have enough time to be celebit and practice 'stop cheating'.

Women give in too soon to a man just because he proposes or gives a ring. Those are desperate moves to get her back, not dealing with the problems that separated them, or his cheating. Cheaters just don't quit instantly...this is a long term process. He cheated for years and you think he can stop in a few days or one week just because he lost you, his 'gravy train'.

Wake up women. Desperation for a man is dangerous. You will lose more than you could ever gain from it. He must bring something to the table and be EVENLY YOKED WITH YOU. God says...do not be unevenly yoked. He knew that 2 people not of the same status in life, is not  a good thing.

I've seen so many uneven married/lovers. It's like a 'misfit', and I know it is from desperation on one or both parts of the couple.

DET could have done much more with this one.",1333238400,3,1487,4.030612244897959
4992310,5,B006IXRIKI,"What Goes Around Comes Around was a very good play. Although the acting could use some work, it was real. I loved how it showed how women know something is wrong in their relationships, but are so in love that they (we), sometimes (more times then we would like to admit), allow the men in our lives (who are caught doing wrong), to flip the script on us and make it our fault. And I loved how it showed we do have the power to turn things around. Great job, Mr. Talbert!",1331769600,5,471,4.130434782608695
4992311,1,B006IXRIKI,Loaded cast but awful script. If you buy it buy used or run like I should have. I love D. Talbert but this script sucks.,1331510400,3,120,3.84
4992312,3,B006IXRIKI,"I have been a huge fan of David E. Talbert's work for the past 5 years and as such have purchased almost every play and movie that he has produced. When this was announced I pre-ordered without hesitation as I have become accustomed to his consistency for producing quality releases. Unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed with this release, it has many known actors and actresses but even they could not save this from being just mediocre. I am still a huge fan of his work and will still continue to support him but this play was not what i was expecting and is not his best effort. See Fabric Of A Man, Mr. Right Now and What My Husband Doesn't Know for better examples of his work!",1331251200,10,688,4.425196850393701

4992345,3,B006IXRIKI,It was okay.  It had its funny moments. I wouldn't call it side splitting fun or incredibly insightful. Normally there is a moral to movies like this and the moral for this one was kind of weak. But it was entertaining.,1361836800,,219,4.341463414634147

4992348,3,B006IXRIKI,"This movie offers a good story and has it's moments.  Not the type of movie you would rush out to the theater to see.  I enjoyed it, but it will be a while before I see it again.",1356480000,,178,3.6578947368421053

4992351,5,B006IXRIKI,"This was awesome, we watched this on Netflix and placed an order for this as well so that we can take the DVD with us to share with family and friends who don't have Netflix and my not have seen this.

We rolled on the floor with laughs and tears! This was so funny, full of lessons, great characters and acting! It is nice to see different actors from the usual cast that you see on most plays and movies.. So give this a chance and laugh your socks off.

There are so many surprises turns and twist in this DVD, there is also so much truth to this DVD... So many will be able to relate to the plot, setting etc.

If you are looking for some great T.V. time, this is  it. We love David E Talbert and own all of his plays and books that have been released and all are great.

This play has a great message, that many will be able to relate to.

Glad to see more plays coming out by him, please keep them coming.

You will be surprised by the cast and will be happy to see different cast members. Not too much singing lots of acting and wisdom spoken in this play. Which is great!

You will also be able to watch this over and over! Love the way David E Talbert introduces this play!

Enjoy!",1339200000,,1190,4.029787234042553
4992352,3,B006IXRIKI,"Finally! A play without 10 thousand songs in it! The play was entertaiing; however, without songs it was very short. It definately needed more story line. If you need something to watch, this is a pretty good play to watch.",1338336000,,223,4.6
