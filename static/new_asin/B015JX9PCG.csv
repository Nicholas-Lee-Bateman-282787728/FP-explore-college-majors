8733847,3,B015JX9PCG,"got it because it is a video made in a nearby neighborhood. I believe it was made with a lower quality  DVD material. It froze up in my DVD player. It was a very low grade B movie, but I didn't expect it to be more than that.",1464480000,,225,3.6875
8733848,5,B015JX9PCG,This film fully captures the B movie experience of the 1970's.  I'm a big fan of Independent films and this film is what it's all about!  The filmmakers did an awesome job recreating and paying homage to that drive-in era of filmmaking.,1450656000,,236,4.595238095238095
8733849,1,B015JX9PCG,"Worst ""movie"" I've ever seen. I wasn't expecting much, but this was horrible. My husband grew-up in Roseville and he wanted to see it. We recognized all the landmarks, but.... I was so glad it was under 45 minutes. Amateur production.",1450483200,,234,4.7317073170731705
8733850,1,B015JX9PCG,"I am sorry....I feel bad but this movie was terrible. Terrible graphics. Drive in theater look? I don't think so. I made better movies than this in my high school media productions class! No dialougue, boring, and just terrible.",1449100800,,228,4.871794871794871
8733851,1,B015JX9PCG,"..Cult classic ...???  Very cool ???.......these two weasel reviewers  that follow below obviously were involved in this practical joke ...45 minutes long and no dialog
It is a shame to waste the film on this nonsense ..Some earnest storyteller could have used it and created a  real movie",1444348800,,289,4.979166666666667
8733852,5,B015JX9PCG,"The story follows a television news reporter who uncovers and does a series of news reports on a story of a 75 year old curse put on a town by a carnival gypsy whose husband was murdered there.  The reporter accidentally unleashes the gypsy's soul and she returns to the town to destroy it.  Loved the story and the ""drive-in"" look and feel the movie has.  If old school is what you crave...Spring Thaw delivers.  A soon to be cult classic!",1442620800,,440,4.395061728395062
8733853,5,B015JX9PCG,Very cool!  A supernatural thriller that has that retro drive-in movie look to it.  Two big thumbs up!,1442534400,,102,4.611111111111111
