7983088,2,B00008G8OR,"This could have been a good, informative video, if not for the host Shari Belafonte.  She's the daughter of far left activist and singer Harry Belafonte, and she apparently absorbed all of his fanatical beliefs over the dinner table.  She can't get through the video without CONSTANTLY talking about slaves, the slave trade, slave goods, slave history, and how terrible white people are.  She mentions island monkeys at one point, and just had to mention that they were brought over on slave ships.  Very tiresome, preachy, out of place, and unfair.

Unfortunately, even when she's not talking about slavery, the rest of the video feels like a commercial for a few shops that must have paid her to be included.  Don't waste your time.",1514246400,,734,4.879032258064516

7983090,4,B00008G8OR,"I enjoyed Ms. Belafonte's narration on the Caribbean: Miami, The Bahamas, Jamaica and Puerto Rico.  I still have the DVD for over a year and I have watched it at least twenty times.

It is worth getting if you are going to visit the Caribbean. The Video Visits DVD was recorded seven years ago.  I do not know what the countries and cities are like now.  It is extremely a good idea to ask your friends who have visited the countries or like the countries traveling bureau.",1185148800,4,473,4.402298850574713
