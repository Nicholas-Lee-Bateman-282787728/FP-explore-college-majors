8304057,5,B001G5ZLMA,"This DVD does a great job of paying tribute to three of Iowa's favorite sons: Jay Sigmund, Grant Wood, and Marvin Cone. All three of these people were active in the legendary Stone City Art Colony. All three bios are done well and the highlight of the DVD is an interview with Nan Wood Graham, Grant Wood's sister and the model for the farmer's daughter in American Gothic. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in regional history.",1329091200,,439,4.641025641025641
