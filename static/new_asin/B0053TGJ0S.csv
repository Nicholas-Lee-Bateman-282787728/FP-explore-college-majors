8455634,5,B0053TGJ0S,"Excellent documentary of 4 distinctly different individuals with mental illness and their battles to connect with people and have meaning in their lives. Fountain House plays a huge part in providing both support and direction, the foundation of trust and acceptance along with limits on behaviors to foster independence and functioning. Some succeed and others manage and will need to try again. Stunningly personal ,heart wrenching yet uplifting as there is hope for the future.",1477526400,,480,5.413333333333333
8455635,5,B0053TGJ0S,"Rare and brilliant look into the lives of those whom the film poster says ""we've all tried not to notice.""  Funny, sad, tragic, inspiring.  Most of all, we learn that people with mental illnesses are like all of us, or we are like them; we all want a home, friends, work.  Frances perhaps most of all touched my with his humanity; a character for the ages.  Thank you to the filmmakers for making this documentary.",1456358400,,414,4.48
8455636,5,B0053TGJ0S,"You can lose a leg and still be you, just you with a prosthetic or in a wheelchair. You can lose an eye and still be you, just with a modification to see from the angles you saw before. You do miss some things, and I'm not saying those two losses aren't traumatic. But there is no prosthetic and there are few accommodations you can make when the loss is in your mind. If it takes months of intensive rehab and a team of specialists to get you walking again after you lose your leg, why do we expect it to be different when you lose a part of your mind? The day you feel you just can't do it anymore and you sit down in the middle of therapy that's helping you adjust to life with one leg, a team surrounds you, encouraging, imploring, even pulling on you to just get up once more. With the stigma of mental illness, there is no team, there are no arms around you, there is only loneliness and the voice of a professional telling you as though at the end of a dimly lit ballfield, ""Your life is not the same; you will never be the same. These pills will help a little.""

Fountain House is the team that says, ""Get up! You're in a battle to save your life and engage with your world again -- get up!"" We follow four individuals through their ups and downs, their struggles and triumphs. We see them fall down, we see them sit down because the next step seems like it's over a cavern, and we see them get up again. One, faced with a fatal tumor still in his forties, accepts it with more grace than many of us would and still pushes to make a difference in the lives of others. He has enough resilience to get outside of himself and tell the residents and workers of Fountain House, ""I love each and every one of you.""

We may become irritated with another, who has only complaining and fighting on his agenda, until we see a bit of the fear he's covering. There's a fear of love, of vulnerability, of losing our independence in all of us. If he makes it work, he lets go of the toughness, the courage, the fight it took to survive on the streets of New York City. The streets call because the terror he knows is less scary than the terror of the new and strange. Mental illness gets it wrong sometimes, but these four show it's not all crazy. Why shouldn't those whose minds become ill receive the encouragement to get up. To see light. To try again?

These are the questions explored in cinema verite on ""West 47th Street."" The people we try not to notice want to live their lives and pursue happiness like any of us. They've been forced to do so with their minds tied behind their backs. See what happens when the bonds are loosened, just a little.",1370822400,,2649,4.210629921259843
8455637,2,B0053TGJ0S,"West 47th Street was a big disappointment to me. The documentary doesn't go in-depth as far as describing how the mentally ill people perceive their lives. We see them only from the outside looking in. The thing rambles on and on, goes nowhere, and that's not an intriguing metaphor, it's just a waste of time. A complete waste of the ridiculous (nearly) $10 fee.",1369180800,,363,4.6875
