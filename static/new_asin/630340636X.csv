I just wanted to add that the editorial reviewer is wrong when he says there is nothing profound here: there's the angel cast out of heaven, the god becoming human, the god  developing compassion, redemption through a spontaneous act, and probably more :-)",1213315200,,294,4.86
7846231,5,630340636X,"I have, as of late, seen countless episodes of STar Trek: TNG thanks to my room-mate unfortunately coming across about 100 episodes at a clearance sale. Most of the episodes are entertaining enough and after spending time with the characters you generally do start to feel for them. However I find most episodes either too timid to celebrate their weirdness or too afraid to truly explore the philisophical undertones they present.
This episode is guilty of none of these things, this episode is merely a really good time. I don't know if the writers were having a good day or if John de Lancie is just a brilliant improvisationalist, whichever it is, this is the only episode of Star Trek that I actually laughed out loud at,that is laughed out loud at things that were supposed to be funny. (Yes the miniature model of the Exxon disaster that kills Tasha Yar is a laugh a minute but I doubt that it was intentionally so.)
I have seen about 50 episodes so far and this is by far my favorite. Yes that is fifty hours of my life ripped away in the span of a month. Now that I am an official Trekkie I'll never get a date again, oh wait, I never get them anyway, at least now I have an excuse.",1039824000,4,1191,4.36936936936937

7846233,5,630340636X,"This is one of the episodes of Star Trek:TNG with one of my favorite characters of the show: Q! This is the episode for everyone who is a newcomer to Star Trek to watch and be in awe and total amazement. After watching this episode, you will become a die-hard Star Trek fan like me and want to watch as many episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation (and maybe even the other series) as you possibly can. This episode, I truly believe, displays Q's best acting and dialogue performance, EVER, from all of his appearances on all the series. He is incredible here in his ability to rouse the other members of the crew and in his acting and, especially, speaking, abilities. He is, dare I say, hilarious in what he says to Capt. Picard, Data, and Worf....and how he says it! But, don't forget about the storyline of the asteroidal moon falling from the sky to its respective planet, Bre'el Four. Can, or, more precisely, will, Q save the planet and restore the moon to its proper orbit? ""There are millions of lives at risk. If you have the power....""",985824000,9,1049,4.46875
7846234,5,630340636X,"This must be one of the funniest Star Trek episodes ever. Tribbles Schmibbles, give me John de Lancie taking pop shots at the Enterprise crew  any day. When Q is unceremoniously deposited on the bridge, mortal and bare  naked, the crew must decide how to deal with their once-omnipotent and  overly playful nemesis.
This is also a nice episode for Data fans. The  android's quiet dignity is the perfect counterbalance to Q's flamboyant  hissy fits. The acting is superb and the dialogue is sharp. This is one of  the best of STTNG, don't pass it up!",966902400,8,549,4.666666666666667
