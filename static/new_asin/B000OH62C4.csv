8184904,1,B000OH62C4,"Bought this expecting ab work and cardio.  This DVD consists of squats as the predominate exercise they do over and over in every segment.  No where in the description does it tell you that. No specific ab workout as expected.  Squat workout should be the main description of this work out.  So, if you want a squat marathon, be sure to get this DVD.  Otherwise, don't bother.",1424736000,2,376,4.552238805970149

8184907,4,B000OH62C4,"I love this work out.  I have most of Gunnar's DVD's.  Initially, I was intimidated at the thought of doing a cardio workout with Gunnar.  I was very surprised at how manageable the workout was.  When it finished (much too soon) I felt like I wanted/needed more.  I think the cardio intervals could have been a bit longer as well.  That said, I found this workout to be fun and fast moving.  I hope to feel results tomorrow!",1297987200,3,424,4.358974358974359
