8648460,5,B00J5MKHIO,Short version -- it is so true-life like; i.e. what one encounters as an Anglican vicar. In my humble opinion for most congregations it should be compulsory to watch all three series!!,1445904000,,184,4.78125
8648461,5,B00J5MKHIO,"During this third season Reverend Adam Smallbone (I love that character name) has to juggle being the father of a new born baby and dealing with the downward plight of his parish, he also has to deal with the Muslim religion, homosexuality, and personal infidelity, this man is a regular everyday guy who happens to be a reverend, that in of itself is the appealing thing about this third season. My favorite episode is when Liam Neeson plays the role of God, you'll have to buy this DVD for yourself to see what I'm talking about, you will need a multi-range DVD player to watch this on.",1425772800,,588,4.5046728971962615
