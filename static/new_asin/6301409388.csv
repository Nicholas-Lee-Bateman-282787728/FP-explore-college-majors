330458,5,6301409388,"When I was younger, this was my favorite movie. My best friend and I used to rent this movie almost every weekend and watch it. This is a wonderful movie for kids anywhere, for I don't know any kid worth the title that saw this movie and didn't love it.",1059350400,,253,4.08
330459,4,6301409388,"This movie is one one of ColumbiaTriStar's few exceptions for family audiences. It was only given a limited release in America in 1988 and (like ""The Trumpet of the Swan"" 13 years later) never got a big audience anyway. I last saw the movie in Dominica on Disney Channel in August of 1996--and never saw it again!

But what upsets me is that, most of the studios' films (with the exception of Columbia's ""Stuart Little"" in 1999 and TriStar's live action feature of ""Madeline"" a year earlier) are targeted on grown-ups, and most of the animated fare goes through Sony Pictures Entertainment's subsidiary for young viewers, Sony Wonder--particularly my favourite one, ""Lapitch the Little Shoemaker"", which came from Croatia.

At least, the Hasbro phenomenon's only movie has gone to Family Home Entertainment--and as for ColumbiaTriStar, I wonder why they've dangerously spent their time and folly on adult-centred movies--and not family ones? Come on, I need to see a DVD edition come off the video shelves really, really soon!!",1012608000,,1027,5.107142857142857

330506,5,6301409388,"I grew up in the 80's and absolutely LOVED the Pound Puppies!  In fact, as embarrassing as this is to admit since I'm an adult, I still have a pound puppy stuffed animal sitting below my alarm clock on the nightstand (right beside this thing I made in Kindergarden that shows drawings of my absolute favorite things- including pizza and, you guessed it, a dog!  I guess some things never change).

Anyway I never could bring myself to get rid of that stuffed animal... he's too adorable!  It was a present for me like, 25 years ago, and I will keep it forever and ever.

Anyway this Pound Puppies movie is about as adorable, loveable, and entertaining as you'd imagine.  You'll wish these puppies were real that's for sure!  Not just because of their personality, but the cuteness factor will surely make you want to absorb your soul into their animated bodies.

At the very least, if your child ever asks for a real puppy, once you watch Pound Puppies & the Legend of Big Paw, you WILL want to give in and provide your child with his or her very own puppy.  You won't be able to turn away from those happy adorable faces, trust me!",1334707200,,1132,4.429951690821256
330507,5,6301409388,It breaks the heart with Big Paw. His song is so sweet he is a sweet dog too. Why is everybody so mean to him?Why didn't they just take him home too love him?Oh and 1 more thing whats is it with this puppy power?And the bone of scone whats with that. By the way i got a 72 on my math test. A 79 on my l.a. test. Here is my contact info BIG PAW is so cute.,1332806400,,355,3.5063291139240507
330508,5,6301409388,Oh the memories!  I bought this for my grandson to watch because I remembered it from when my kids were small. He loves it just as much as they did.  It gets watched multiple times a week.,1329609600,,188,4.054054054054054
330509,5,6301409388,This was by far the best movie my mom gave me growing up . i loved this soo much she went and got me my very own pound puppy. i searched for it so my daughters can kno what a great movie this is and they loved it and my youngest really doesnt sit for movies yet but sat through this one . i would def recommend this to anyone with children,1293753600,,339,3.7222222222222223
330510,1,6301409388,"This has to have been the worst film I have ever seen, next to Monster A Go-Go and A Kid in King Arthur's Court!! This review will not do it justice.",1286668800,,149,3.838709677419355
330511,1,6301409388,This movie is a awful mess. The cast is forgettable. It has zero redeeming value. It has nothing to do with the TV series AND the toyline it was base on. The story makes zero sense at all. The animation is choppy & subpar. I seen better animation from TV Funhouse. The songs are awful and make the songs from The Tom & Jerry Movie sound good. The voice acting stinks. It sounds like it was done by a drunk 4 year old. I give this film 1 out of 10.,1285113600,,447,3.923076923076923
330512,5,6301409388,"I religiously watched this movie as a kid and just recently decided to track it down. Smart decision on my behalf, pound puppies and the legend of big paw is full of memorable characters and adorable songs. My favorite is big paw's debut ""come on give me half a chance now cause i'm a puppy too"" lyrics. Basically, this movie is about the ""scone bone"" which allows humans and animals to talk to each other. ""McNasty"" steals the bone in order to rule the world and breaks it in half, making it impossible for the humans to communicate with the animals (puppy power). Anyway, it's a super cute movie any kid would be lucky to have!",1264809600,,629,4.431034482758621
330513,5,6301409388,I am so excited to finally have this on dvd im collecting cartoon's from when I was little. This cartoon was on a video of old cartoons my grandpa taped for before he got sick and died i must have wached it a hundred times before my grandma lost it the movie is as good as I remember and brings back lots of good memorys. Now if they would put the pound puppy series on dvd that would rule.,1258761600,,390,3.949367088607595
330514,5,6301409388,My son (age 3) is a huge fan of the Pound Puppies so I was very happy when I found this movie. He watches it almost everyday.,1252627200,,125,3.6666666666666665
330515,5,6301409388,"This is a great kids movie! I love this movie when I was a kid! This movie is a classic, filled with adventures and music! I recommend any kids to adults(to those to watched this) to watch it! Its worth having if you're a pound puppies fan!",1246924800,,240,4.127659574468085
330516,5,6301409388,"I loved this movie when I was a kid. It is a great movie. When my niece and nephew saw a pound puppy in the store it reminded me of the movie that I had watched when i was five years old. Came home and youtubed it so i could see if I still remembered the title and if it matched the movie I remembered. Shortly after realizing it was I searched stores around my city that have older movies, ebay, kijiji, and then my best friend that had watched the movie with me as a child had told me that she had bought a copy of it a while ago on Amazon for her daughter. I loved this movie when I was younger. It is a great movie, and to be honest I still enjoy watching it to this day with my niece and nephew.",1233446400,,700,3.8013698630136985
330517,5,6301409388,"I thought this movie was fantastic!
The shipping time was great too!
I may be young still, but rest assured that it will stay in my collection forever, until I can show it to great-grandchildren!!",1192838400,,196,4.628571428571429
330518,5,6301409388,"This has to be one of the most loved videos for young children there is!  My grandchildren have all fallen in love with this video.  I first taped this program off of the television just by happen chance and it became such a favorite I feared the tape would break from over use.  My 16 year old granddaughter still loves it.  How wonderful to have a video that all of my grandchildren, ages 2 - 16 will actually sit together and watch and enjoy.  Its a classic that will endure!!",1191628800,,479,4.277777777777778
330519,5,6301409388,"It was great. If you don't like this movie and its spectacular songs, there is something wrong with your sense of good taste.",1185753600,,125,4.478260869565218
330520,5,6301409388,I remember watching this movie when I was younger and was ecstatic to find it on dvd and available for purchase.,1180742400,,112,4.380952380952381
330521,3,6301409388,"I would like to give it 3 and a half stars actually,,,,,,the reason being that I directed it almost 20 years ago,,,,it was a great challenge after completing the supervising of the series 'Spiral Zone' ( 65 episodes .

We did the pre-production in 2 months and a half and the actual production in 3 months,,,,,so a feature film made in 5 months and a half instead of the usual 3 years the Disney studio takes,so I believed then that as a director all doors in Hollywood would be open to me,,,,,stupid was I..............Nothing did happen,I never got a thank you from the executive producer or the Bonus money I was promissed.

But it was fun all the way,working an average 16 hours a day seven days a week,timing exposure sheets,checking layouts,animation,BG's,and we never made pencil testing exept for about 10 scenes of dancing at the pound;I had to flip drawings,even cells that had inbetweening mistakes to judge the animation.

The storyboard was completed in 6 weeks of wich I made more then a quarter of it,I don't know how I found all the energy to work like that,,,I guess I was young and full of passion for animation.

I did keep all my Artwork all these years and as bad as the film may be,considering the conditions and time we had to make it,.,,,I am proud of it no matter what. It was an extreme challenge that gave me experience and confidence,perhaps one day I may make a feature film in 3 years instead of 5 months and a half.

Thank you.  Pierre De Celles",1167004800,24,1476,4.530075187969925
330522,5,6301409388,"I was extremely excited when I saw this had come out on DVD.  I've been a Pound Puppies fan since I was little, and to have at least of piece of that on DVD is very cool.  The story's fun, and as a kid (and even now) the characters are lively and enjoyable.

There wasn't anything amazing about the DVD, but one of the features I liked (that isn't present on all DVDs) was the direct play.  No pesky button pushing.  They haven't done anything fancy with the animation but, being as it was released in 1988, the quality isn't bad anyway.  It's as I remember it, and it's fun to hear the voices again and reconnect with the characters.

A great movie for fans, young and old, as well as those who haven't seen it yet!",1164499200,10,716,4.182481751824818
330523,5,6301409388,It's Pretty Cool. And The Songs In It Are Way Cool. I Used To Rent It Before And I Was Blown Away By It. The Movie Starts Off When The Youngest Pound Puppie Whooper Is Telling Two Little Cute Puppies (A Boy And Girl Puppy) A Story Of How Dogs Can Talk To People. Then The Movie Has A Bad Guy In It. And He Takes A Little Of Cute Bulldog Puppies. Then He Turns Them To Be Big And Bad. Then He Tells His Two Henchmen To Get Some Bone From A Big Place. So If You Want To Know What Happens Next. Then Take My Word For It And Buy This Movie. Oh And My Favorite Pound Puppie On Here Is Cooler Because He Rocks!! And He Also Has The Best Ideas. So I Would Like Everyone To Buy This Movie. It's A Must Have For Any Movie Collection.,1120176000,,724,3.801324503311258

7811737,5,6301409388,"Oh man! Can't tell you just how excited I was to find this movie on DVD! As a kid I had this recorded on a VHS and watched it over and over again. I loved the music in it! And of course, the talking puppies lol And now as an adult I watch it over and over again with my kids and now we all sing the songs!  If you've never seen it and have small children I highly recommend it, the story is cute, the music is fifties style and will get you singing and dancing.",1491177600,,461,3.752577319587629

7811744,4,6301409388,"I used to watch the Pound Puppies all the time and this movie really was pretty good for its day.  I bought it for 4 bucks because my 10 year old daughter wanted it, though it may have been more for me than her in some ways.  I enjoyed the movie and the story was pretty good as well.  It's great to be able to share it with my daughter so many years later, and being able to see her get as much joy out of it as I did is great.  I remember renting this from the video store on numerous occasions, and now I can finally own it.  Can't wait to watch it again.",1427760000,,558,3.7758620689655173
