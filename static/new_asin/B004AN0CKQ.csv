4310068,3,B004AN0CKQ,"For $15, this is a pretty good intro to both Dr Zahi Hawass and Egyptology.

For the most part, Dr Hawass does an introduction of the material for that episode, then another subject matter expert takes over.  I felt as if I had seen a good bit of the film in previous documentaries abt ancient Egypt.  So, if you are a documentary ""junkie,"" this is not the documentary for you.

If you are new to documentaries or just want to show the kids some facet of Egyptology, then this is a value-priced set just for that purpose.",1313452800,11,521,4.34020618556701
4310069,3,B004AN0CKQ,"While the content is quite informative, the production is not High Def by any stretch of the imagination. Don't let this sway you from purchase, but if there's a standard DVD of this and that DVD is less expensive, you'd best go with that.  If you're looking to be dazzled by a visual feast of antiquity only, you'll be disappointed.",1301443200,21,333,4.55
