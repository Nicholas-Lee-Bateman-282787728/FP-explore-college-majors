8692077,5,B00QMWEJ16,"Mill Creek Entertainment brings together a 4 movie blu-ray collection containing two good films (""Vertical Limit"", ""White Squall""), one guilty pleasure (""Terminal Velocity""), and one piece of laughable cinematic garbage (""Stealth"").

""Vertical Limit"" and ""Stealth"" share one dual layered blu-ray. ""Terminal Velocity"" and ""White Squall"" share the other disc. All 4 films are presented in their original theatrical aspect ratios. English subtitles are included for each film which is nice due to Mill Creek doesn't always do that on their budget blu-ray releases.

Picture quality is good for each film though it is obvious these are older HD masters. Detail varies a bit but overall looks solid overall. The bit rate gets into the low 20's during busy sections and visually represent a marked improvement over previous DVD releases. Sound for each film is presented in 5.1 HD audio sounding quite full and punchy. No extras are included.

Overall this is a fun set that offers nice variety though the quality varies a bit in terms of the actual movies. But for how cheap you can get this collection at most stores (I nabbed mine for only 7 dollars), it comes recommended.",1496534400,,1170,5.083333333333333
