Apparently some type of ""newly defined"" religion is what formed this great state.  The ""Code"" is a product of human behavior that emits from some kind of ""cowboy ethic"" that has nothing to do with the God who created this historically epic region.  This flick amounted to an extra long commercial about the State and explains why its people act the way they do.  If it wasn't for various pictures of the overall area I wouldn't appreciate this film at all.  I found it vapid and humanistic trying to sell matter over substance.",1345248000,2,683,4.705882352941177
