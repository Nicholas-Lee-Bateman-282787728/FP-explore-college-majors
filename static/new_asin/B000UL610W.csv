I only wish the show would have lasted longer. Not to mention the quick delivery. Thank you!",1361491200,,268,4.2745098039215685
8213642,5,B000UL610W,"I first discovered ""Our Hero"" on MoviePlex. This very will written half hour series follows the trials, loves, and misadventures of Kale and her high school friends in Toronto. Much of Kale's internal dialogue is done in the form a fan published magazine, or 'zine, that Kale produces, called ""Our Hero"",complete is funny annimated illistrations.

Episodes run from the comical (""The Stupid Issue"") to the heartbreaking (""The Last Laugh Issue""), and everything in between. I recommend this series to anyone who is looking for well crafted, wonderfully acted series. It is best for late teens and adutls.",1213747200,4,603,5.216494845360825
