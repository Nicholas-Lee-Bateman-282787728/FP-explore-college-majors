8090509,4,B000BP86TG,"I alway enjoyed Norm Crosby's off-beat, different approach to humor.  I had forgotten over the years how much he made me laugh until I dug out a large collection of VHS tapes of Dean Martin's roasts of celebrities.  I had bought them through the mail. watched a couple, and until recently I had let them gather dust.  Crosby's performance is 37 years old, yet most of the subject matter is still relevant stuff.",1402444800,,411,4.602739726027397
8090510,4,B000BP86TG,A great humorous lesson on how the English language is misused.  It is a great reminder on how we can get lazy when speaking.,1401235200,,125,4.208333333333333
8090511,5,B000BP86TG,The only complaint I have about this DVD is it isn't long enough. Norm  appeared sometimes on the Dean Martin Roasts. His humor is just as good now years later.,1359158400,,160,4.333333333333333
