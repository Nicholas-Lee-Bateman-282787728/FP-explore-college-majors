8606085,2,B00EJSMOPI,"Disc 5 is a waste of time.  It plays half an episode and then freezes and skips to the last half of the next episode.  Tried everything to make it work, but it remains useless.  Haven't got to disc 6 yet, but trying to follow the story line of the series makes this impossible.",1423526400,,277,4.092592592592593
