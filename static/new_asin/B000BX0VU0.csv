I love it how lu and Dana become friends, in spite of their differences. I also like it how Lu, can be annoying at times, but you still can't help but to like her! Terrific show!",1147392000,4,315,4.3559322033898304
2444395,5,B000BX0VU0,"It's no surprise that Stong Medicine, has lasted so long on Lifetime, from episode one it was evident that this show was not just another medical show. Strong Medicine has strength and courage of the female kind. It's not very often we see a show so full of passion, conviction, and focus to educate women as well as men of the importance of womens health, physically and emotionally. Rosa Blasi character of ""Dr Luisa Delgado"", is so moving. It's performances like Rosa Blasi, Jenifer Lewis, and Joshua Cox that keep me on the edge of my seat. I love the show and I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to be available on DVD.....It's great and I can't wait.",1140998400,10,661,4.471074380165289
2444396,5,B000BX0VU0,During Strong Medicine's airing It gave up to the minute stories of real medical problems faced not only by women but problems faced by all of the family. The acting was top notch. You tended to belive Rosa Blasi really was a Doctor. The rest of the cast was just as good in their roles. I am so glad the first season is out now on DVD.It is (was)the best show on TV. Every woman should see this show and any one who loves her.,1140739200,6,427,4.035294117647059
2444397,5,B000BX0VU0,The best show ever! I just hope the seasons continue to be released.,1140307200,4,68,4.3076923076923075
2444398,5,B000BX0VU0,I watched Strong Medicine when it first started on Lifetime and have ALWAYS wanted the DVD. I had hope they would make DVDS on the seasons and looks like they are starting! Finally!,1140220800,4,181,4.515151515151516
2444399,5,B000BX0VU0,"While the Strong Medicine series was coming to a close forever, I was wondering how I was going to get my weekly ""fix"" of Strong Medicine.  I have been a faithful watcher since its inception, 6 years ago.  I even sent an email to Lifetime Network to encourage them to have Strong Medicine available on DVD.  Lo and Behold, they have started!  This is absolutely the best show ever.  Each character is written very well, and the story lines are unique and genuine.  It's a shame that the show has ended for good, but at least I'll have my DVD's!",1139184000,3,544,4.39

2444401,5,B000BX0VU0,Strong medicine is one of the best shows Lifetime has ever produced. It is the ultimate show being that it showcases womens talents in the medical field. It deals with issues ranging from rape to murder to abortion. This is one buy you won't regret!,1135641600,6,249,4.555555555555555
2444402,5,B000BX0VU0,"I have seen a lot of the episodes of `Strong Medicine' on Lifetime, and I feel that it is one of the most underrated TV shows being show today. It is a great show that portrays hope, life, relationships, and emotions in each episode. I am glad that this show is finally releasing on DVD, as we can get to watch the series from the beginning.

The story mainly revolves around Dr. Lu Delgado and Dr. Dana Stowe, two women who have nothing in common with each other, except for their passions in the field of work. They work in the Rittenhouse Women's Health Clinic, where they face new challenges, and solve new problems from performing plastic surgery to treating HIV positive patients. This DVD set contains the first 22 episodes of Season 1, which are:

01. Pilot

02. Preexisting Conditions

03. Misconceptions

04. Second Look

05. Performance Anxiety

06. Drug Interactions

07. Do No Harm

08. Miracle Cure

09. Dependency

10. BRCA1

11. BRCA2

12. Brainchild

13. Second Opinion

14. Side Effects

15. Blessed Events

16. Fix

17. Maternity

18. Complications

19. Childcare

20. Drugstore Cowgirl

21. Wednesday Night Fever

22. Mortality

Not only is this show moving, but you also learn something in each episode. Developed by Whoopi Goldberg and created by Tammy Ader, `Strong Medicine' has won numerous awards. Rosa Blasi (who plays Dr. Lu Delgado) won an Imagen Award for Best Actress in a Drama series. I doubt this DVD set will contain any special features, except for the standard ones like languages, and subtitles, but nevertheless, it is worth buying this DVD just to see the episodes.

Being sweet and sour at times, `Strong Medicine' is a wonderful drama that will definitely make you feel better.",1131667200,46,1719,4.824742268041237

2444422,5,B000BX0VU0,I chose to rate this series at 5 stars because it deals with real issues in everyday life. The characters are developed slowly throughout the episodes. Each one being a complete story. The contrast between the female leads rings true and lives up to their back stories. Anyone who likes their drama with a bite would go for this series.,1369353600,,336,4.616666666666666
2444423,4,B000BX0VU0,"Cute show.  It seems harmless enough and is entertaining if you like this sort of show.  It doesn't make you feel as connected to it as I would have liked, however.",1365811200,,164,4.258064516129032
2444424,5,B000BX0VU0,This show demonstrates strength in differences. It provides real world situation and great outcomes (good & bad). The cast are an excellent mix to entertain viewers. I enjoyed watching the first season. Please offer other seasons.,1362355200,,230,5.416666666666667

2444430,5,B000BX0VU0,I finally caved and bought the DVD set because I couldn't find season 1 anywhere online. Package arrived fairly quickly and I'm current enjoying the 6th episode!! :D,1354060800,,165,4.928571428571429
2444431,5,B000BX0VU0,"I never missed an episode of Strong Medicine ever! When the series was cancelled, I was devastated. When I found Season 1 on Amazon, I had to buy it. As soon as it arrived, I watched the entire season (I was up for a while). I wish the other seasons were available so I can purchase those, too.

My favorite character is Lu because she's no nonsense and doesn't let anyone intimidate her. Lana and Peter are also favorites. At first, Dana comes across as snobbish and stuffy but, as the show progresses, she warms up a lot. If the other seasons ever become available, I'll definitely buy them.

I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys medical dramas about women's issues.",1346716800,2,676,4.532786885245901
2444432,5,B000BX0VU0,I love this series. This was the perfect price for this awesome set of DVDs. If you loved this show you can spend endless hours watching these shows. You will love this show if you are fan of medical shows.,1346112000,,206,4.175

2444434,4,B000BX0VU0,"Amazon completely understands how complicated it is to find a collection that other stores are not selling anymore. If you are looking for anything that was 10, 15, or a few decades ago, Amazon has it all. Old with the new, and new with the old.",1327622400,,245,4.3478260869565215

2444436,5,B000BX0VU0,"I was so excited to unwrap this on Christmas morning! The show is addicting. I remember watching it for hours when it used to appear on Lifetime. I really wish they would release more besides Season One but oh well, I'm happy with this for now. Another good thing about this show is that the episodes are an hour long so don't feel just because it lists 21 episodes you aren't getting a lot because you really are! Plus it includes a pilot that I for one, had never seen before. I really enjoy watching these episodes and I recommend this DVD set to any fan of the show.",1325030400,,570,4.238532110091743

2444439,5,B000BX0VU0,"This series is great because it sends a positive message to woman of different ages and nationalities. Unlike other medical dramas, it manages to keep a good balance between the cases and the characters' personal lives. All the cases feels very real and the solutions very plausible.

I bought this DVD for my best friend who has loved Strong Medicine for years. She is very happy with her DVD set and was so excited that she watched the entire season in two days. The only bad thing is that there are no more seasons on DVD. We can only wish that they will release more in the neat future.",1261008000,5,590,4.412844036697248

2444443,4,B000BX0VU0,"Good drama, good sense of humor. It has serious topics but doesn't get too preachy or stuffy. Down to earth characters that are real and very likable. I wish it was still going, House can be a little too cold sometimes.",1232582400,3,219,4.365853658536586
2444444,5,B000BX0VU0,"I became a fan of Strong Medicine later in their run, so I am very grateful to be able to go back and start from the beginning.  I can't wait until the Second Season comes out!

This is crazy...I love this show. Maybe they leave us hanging because not enough people have written in...maybe they want to see if there is truly a desire...on the other hand...ya know how some items are pulled off the shelf once the manufacturer finds out they work? Hopefully they are not doing the same here. Blockbuster told me they thought Amazon had a petition going...I wonder if this is what is being considered the petition or if there is any truth in that statement.

I have seen in the online message boards how many young girls have written to the actresses, talking about how this show has inspired them to become doctors. Many women are out there without good medical care or the means to provide for themselves. This show inspires us women who have nothing to become something. It is also a really cool drama that will open your eyes to diseases and other health related issues in a way that ER will not. ER is more focused on the relationships between the actors, where this show is focused on the health issues and their impacts on the people's lives. A very, very good show.

8093656,5,B000BX0VU0,"I was watching old Lifetime movies and ran across a recommendation for this show. I had never seen it, but I enjoy medical dramas and ones that deal with ethical issues. I finished the season in 3 days! The only problem? There are NO OTHER seasons available on DVD or anywhere else to watch for that matter! I loved season 1, but I can't speak to any of the other ones. Since this was released in 2006 or 2008, I doubt they are putting the rest out on DVD, but I wish they would so I could follow the series for 5 more seasons. Warning: this is a great show, but if you get too attached like me, prepare to be upset that you can't see the rest!",1468713600,2,644,4.0390625
