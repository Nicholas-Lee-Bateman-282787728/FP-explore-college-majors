8051883,2,B0007UQ4RG,"I was curious about this film through reading Ed Ricketts' ""anti-script""  offered in response to his friend Steinbeck's concept for the film. and wanted to glean what the rift between himself and Steinbeck was about.  Ricketts was right - the film turned out to be simplistic and patronizing.  Like many of the writers of his time, Steinbeck became enamored with the ""benefits"" of civilization and didn't appreciate, as Ricketts did, what was being lost in the process of modernization. That the film was supposedly created in response to that era's  Nazi political threats to the Americas south of our southern border - to show how gracious and concerned the Norte Americanos were for the peones - took my accumulated regard for Steinbeck down another notch.  He should have listened to his friend Ed.

Turns out the entire film is available on You Tube, so I didn't have to spend my money for this scratchily recorded version.",1380412800,,928,4.916666666666667
8051884,3,B0007UQ4RG,"Product was delivered on time and as expected.  The production quality was just so-so.  That being said, if you have an interest in Steinbeck, you may be interested in the film.  To my knowledge it's the only film he made.",1355702400,,222,4.5
8051885,5,B0007UQ4RG,"The story set in rural Mexico is timeless in its message on the human condition. It cleverly conveys the struggle in Society between the myths and superstitions of the past, and the advent of modern technology that puts to rest such misguided notions. Particularly the work focuses on the advent of modern medicine and sanitary practices versus the questionable practices of a witchdoctor or old wiseman, and the struggle of the people of ""The Forgotten Village"" to come to terms with and accept the methods of modern medicine. A brief interesting interlude into cinematographic technology and its role in conveying the message of modern medicine to the ""The Forgotten Village"" is provided.",1354838400,,690,5.169642857142857
8051886,5,B0007UQ4RG,"The Forgotten Village (1941) Is An Interesting Low Budget Movie Made With Amateur Actors.

The Forgotten Village (1941) is an interesting experimental movie made inexpensively and using amateur actors in Mexico, narrated by Burgess Meredith and written by John Steinbeck.

The short movie is a portrait of a rural Mexican village which has public health problems in the form of local drinking water sources infected by pernicious parasitic microorganism germs. Children in the small village die, and the local ""witchdoctor"" Indian old lady who serves as the village ""doctor"" does not cure the sick and dying children with her folk remedies, which include wrapping the children's abdominal area in snake skins.

The only educated person in the village is a young male schoolteacher, and he proposes that the village request visitation and assistance by the Mexican federal government rural health service both to attend to the sick and dying children, and also to correct the infected water supply problem.

The old lady ""witchdoctor"" leads a revolt against the teacher's proposal, and when the government officials do visit the village in time to correct the problems the bad water has caused, the same old lady organizes the villagers in a boycott of the visiting health officials. Her influence is strong and seemingly absolute. Only one person, a teen aged boy named ""Juan Diego,"" is influenced by the schoolteacher and moves to welcome the Mexico federal government public rural visiting health care workers, and cooperate with them.

The boy takes his sick young sister to the visiting government doctors, who treat her, and also move to correct the water infection problem without the permission of the local people.

Juan Diego is thrown out of his home by his angry father, who sides with the witchdoctor lady, and the schoolteacher arranges for the boy to go to a big city in Mexico and obtain advanced education in health care.

At the end of the movie, we see big city Mexico and young adult students in lab coats, looking into microscopes and watching medical operations, learning about scientific, modern health care they can take back to the rural villages many of them have come from.

The actors are all amateurs, but the camera and editor work in the movie is excellent, and so is the direction of the actors by the movie's director, Herbert Kline.

Burgess Meredith's excellent and understated narration is also very good.

The overall result is a very interesting and poignant movie about simple people in rural Mexico, and problems they face, including social problems which prevent their access to modern public health care services and medicine.

The small village shown in the movie had no electricity, motor cars, modern communications (telephones, etc.) and had only a one room school and a single educated young male schoolteacher. This man becomes the pivotal figure in the story, the man who saves the health of the people in his village, in spite of the fact they try to refuse the help he suggests, and do not appreciate or reward his efforts.

It's a very old story told many times over history. The Forgotten Village (1941) is an interesting re-telling of the story, worth seeing and thinking about.

8051888,5,B0007UQ4RG,"When I was 7 years old my Father acquired a photogravure book titled ""THE FORGOTTEN VILLAGE"". As often as I was allowed I read and reread that book until I grew up and left home, never realizing that all the photographs were extracted from a motion picture.

In the early 1980's while looking through a movie catalog I came across a John Steinbeck VHS tape of a movie having the same title. Suspecting a connection I ordered the film and happily discovred they were the same.

In 2007 because of the tape's age and the frequency with which I viewed it, I began to search for the movie on DVD. I passed over this product for several months due to the erroneous Studio editorial review. The story has absolutely nothing to do with murder and prostitution. It isn't ""BY"" Burgess Meredith, he was the narrator for the story.

By the time it was restored the film's sound and exposure had greatly deteriorated but one should not bypass acquisition of it for that reason.

The story, cinematography, acting and narration in this film are all superb.

I have enjoyed the drama, family relationships and challenge to antiquated traditional social values in a rural environment in this story for more than 65 years. I strongly recommend it to all.",1189036800,3,1238,4.686635944700461
8051889,5,B0007UQ4RG,"In this day and age of huge hollywood style blockbusters, everything you see on screen seems very scripted and predictible. Plus everyone is better looking than in real life and there are no surprises.

What we sometimes forget is that cinema doesn't have to be this way. In fact in much of the world movies are much more free form and tell a more honest story than the average Bruce Willis shoot em up.

The Forgotten Villiage is a film that reminds us how honest American movies can be. While the storyline about blackmail and murder is a very typical hollywood genere, the way the film was made is anything but.

The producers shot the film in Mexico and used real mexican non professional actors. Then they let them improvise many of the scenes to be more authentic and actually illustate what their daily lives are like.

This makes all the difference in the world - and brings us closer to a real universal global movie experience.

I found the actual drama in the film to be much more exciting than otherwiwse, simply because I felt more connected to the characters.

They seemed like real people, just like you and me.

I applaud films that dare to take a risk like this and I'm happy that this movie was preserved and not forgotten.",1162944000,5,1241,4.538116591928251
8051890,5,B0007UQ4RG,"What's better - living life the way your ancestors have for generations. Or, is it better to give up your traditions in favor of modern conveniences, even if they will destroy your way of life forever?

That's the subject of this fictionalized presentation of life in Mexico between the First and Second World Wars.

The deal is that a villiage is temporarily suffering and it's problems can be cured by modern medicine and technology. But, if left to their own devices the problems will resolve themselves - but will cause a lot of short term suffering.

So the villagers have to decide to accept help that will force them to become part of modern Mexican society or reject the help and keep to their traditions even if it will cause some of them to die.

It's very, very thought provoking.",1146700800,5,791,4.628571428571429
