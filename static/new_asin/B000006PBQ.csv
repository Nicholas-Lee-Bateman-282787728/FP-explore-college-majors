1196149,4,B000006PBQ,"""The Man Who Loved Women"" is part comedic-drama, part psychological study of the male and female pysche and part relationship manual for males lacking confidence. I believe this is one of Burt Reynolds' best movies for the myriad of themes touched on throughout the movie. For one, the image one might have of the real-life Burt Reynolds doesn't seem too far from his role as David Fowler.  It has been often stated, maybe unfairly, that Burt Reynolds doesn't act, he ""Behaves.""  In this movie he plays a man so obsessed with women that it literally kills him. While this might be a metaphor for a bigger point, Burt's character resonates with a certain truism about the male psyche. Man's insatiable appetite for sexual conquests and new adventures. Now, of course, this is not politically correct for the staunch conservatives who swear such thinking and behavior are relegated to those uncultivated individuals who feed off depravity and debauchery. But, behind closed doors there is a different story--human nature.

Burt explains his motives in the movie, which pretty much sums up the feelings of many men, which is that for every commitment one makes within a loving relationship, he yearns for the women he hasn't had.  The typical ""Grass being greener on the other side.""  Sometimes art does replicate reality.  Also, the women who are wooed by David Fowler (Reynolds) are multi-dimensional in scope. They all demonstrate a sense of strength while revealing their vulnerabilities.  It's their strength coupled with these vulnerabilities that attract Fowler to them in addition to their physicality.

Can a movie made in the early 1980's still be relevant to the changing gender roles of the 2000's?  A lot has changed between men and women within 25 years, but much has remained the same. Through the subtle humor throughout the movie, I challenge viewers to delve into the subliminal messages expressed. It's all there.

1196150,2,B000006PBQ,"Pacing is very important. Also, the actors must say interesting things and keep the thing moving along. Burt and Julie in her office, not saying much, is not good film making. But, the part with the dog stuck to Burt's hand is very funny (although not as good as the sex outfit in NEVER AGAIN). There are far better comedies out there: Jack Lemon's stuff for instance(UNDER THE YUM YUM TREE, GOOD NEIGHBOR SAM, THE OUT OF TOWNERS).",1172102400,,431,4.538461538461538
1196151,2,B000006PBQ,"In the climatic moment of one of the great film scripts of all time, ""The Verdict"" by David Mamet, attorney Edward Concannon (James Mason) implores the judge, ""We can't be expected to accept a (photo)copy when we have the  original.""  Many consider Truffaut's 1977 ""L'homme qui aimait les femmes""  a wonderful film. Anyone who has seen this original, need not venture to  this 1983 remake, the land of Blake Edwards, his family and his  friends.
This film likely falls under the category of `the studio still  needs another film from me (Edwards) and I have not a single inspired  idea'.
Don't get me wrong. I'm an avid fan of Edwards, and consider many  of his films (notably Days of Wine and Roses, Breakfast at Tiffanys,  S.O.B., and Operation Petticoat to ALL be amongst my favorites. Of course  the Pink Panther series is a masterpiece in and of itself.
But this film  is weak, and uninspired, laden with narrative-I've never really figured who  came up with the idea of opening a `comedy' with the main character's  funeral, and an accompanying heart-wrenching eulogy from one of his lovers.
Don't accept a copy when the original is available.",952905600,5,1149,4.8307692307692305
1196152,3,B000006PBQ,"Blake Edwards's 1983 remake of Francois Truffaut's classic, ""The Man Who Loved Women"" (1977) has the basic elements of countless adult films: it plays like an extended male/female sexual fantasy. Male viewers  may place themselves in the role of David Fowler (Burt Reynolds), the stud  who can be loved, adored, and physically satisfied by scores of women at  once; female viewers will adore Burt's sensitive, artistic, sexually  aggressive male lover. Thus, on a psychological level, Edwards's film is  completely unrealistic hogwash; it treats its subject with  half-seriousness, half-camp, and becomes extremely dull. Blake Edwards  scores in a few areas ignored by Truffaut, however; first, he includes a  riotously funny subplot where Fowler travels to Texas and has an affair  with an oilman's wife (Kim Basinger) who is turned on by sexual activity in  high-risk places. (When Basinger tries to seduce Reynolds in an empty hotel  room, he warns her, ""Oh, no! I know how you operate. There's some sort  of danger here, isn't there? What is there, an Elk's Club meeting here  tonight?"") Second, Edwards exploits Reynolds's image as the  sweet-talking ladykiller to perfection; it becomes extremely satisfying to  hear Reynolds wheedle his way into womens' lives with carefully-chosen  words and phrases.",929491200,,1308,5.400990099009901
1196153,2,B000006PBQ,"Too slick, hip and cool for my britches.  An Americanization of a European classic that doesn't work.  Funny for American audience tastes, but too physical, too materialistic in its approach for my liking.
There's a  spiritual element to the Truffault version that's missing in the American  one with Mr. Reynolds.  The French one is more subtle, deeper and sincere.",925516800,,366,5.135593220338983
1196154,5,B000006PBQ,"I have seen this movie several times, and each time I love it more.  Burt Reynolds holds many of the same thoughts that others fantasize about.  He loves them and leaves them........but never realy leaves them.  They all  love him.  He is constantly searching for his real love, and when he thinks  he finds it, it is too late.  There is brief nudity done in excellent  taste.  The women selected to play these parts are excellent choices.  The  real beauties of Hollywood come out.  Burt love them all and they love him.  A really great movie.  Be prepared to leave horney.",914630400,3,574,4.554455445544554

1196160,4,B000006PBQ,"The title of 1983s The Man Who Loved Women tells you everything you need to know: Burt Reynolds plays David Fowler, a man who sees the beauty in practically every woman and therefore can never settle down with one. As such, he ends up isolated and on the couch of a therapist, Marianna (Julie Andrews). The entire movie consists of Marianna trying to figure David out and help him while the latter relays several of his amorous connections in flashback. When the therapy is over will THEY start a relationship? Fowlers many women include Kim Basinger, Marilu Henner and Denise Crosby.

I encourage you to read Nsouthern51's review from April 25, 2001, on IMDb because it expertly interprets and evaluates the movie. While the film could be considered a romantic comedy its also a tragic study of a Romeo and therefore theres a pall of melancholy despite the light tone and amusing elements, including black comedy. Speaking of which, while I don't think adulterys something to take lightly and therefore don't find it very amusing, it ties into Fowlers folly and blindness due to his weakness, women.

The good thing is that Fowlers not all bad or unlikable (Burt is his typical amiable self in an atypical role). Hes not the conventional lothario who uses and abuses; he genuinely loves women and is fascinated by them. He loves them so much he cant bear to be with just one because that would mean hed never know hundreds or thousands of others, but then he aches because he doesnt want to hurt the women he leaves.

The best part is Fowlers salvation of a new-to-the-trade prostitute whom he ends up hiring for his sculpting business. He nobly resists acting on his carnal instincts and therefore sacrifices for her good. The girl is played by a pre-Star Trek (TNG) Denise Crosby and she looks great.

At the end of the day the movie features Reynolds in an unusual role, which might turn off fans, and the strange mix of melancholy and amusement may turn-off others. Its not great, but its good enough for what it is and therefore worthwhile. Its similar to Altmans Dr. T and the Women (2000) so if you don't like that movie you probably won't like this one.

The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Houston, Texas, and Los Angeles, CA.
