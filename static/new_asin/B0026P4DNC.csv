8353310,4,B0026P4DNC,"I bought the DP-008 recorder, had it for a week and made some progress recording. However, I could not figure out how to merge tracks and how to export tracks. I am a beginner and was not even familiar with some of the terminology. Even though this tutorial was prepared to explain the operation of the four track version, the similarities between the four and eight track versions are very close. Anyway, the DVD was VERY helpful in figuring out how to record, merge and edit tracks. It gave me enough knowledge so that the instructional book now makes more sense to me. If you are a beginner, this DVD is a must to get you going. If you are experienced at recording and working with multiple tracks, this might not be all that helpful (but it sure won't hurt). The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I think it is a little over priced.",1446681600,,854,4.34375
8353311,5,B0026P4DNC,"The Tascam DP-004/DP-008 DVD Tutorial by Pro Audio DVD's is an excellent value and superb instruction. This DVD was originally produced for the DP-004 but works perfectly for the 008. Even if you have read the manual on the basic operation you are sure to find bits of information that can only be gotten from an experienced audio engineer. The video is entertaining, easy to follow and will get you recording successfully in a short time.  If in the future professional recording becomes an option I will come here for my instruction first. Highly Recommended!",1439164800,,561,4.905263157894737
8353312,5,B0026P4DNC,Very good instructions made learning DP-008 quick I would recommend this to others,1406505600,,82,5.384615384615385
8353313,5,B0026P4DNC,Great portable product. Even better for home use.  Just plug in and record. Great for teaching oneself to mix. Nice!,1356048000,,116,4.8
8353314,5,B0026P4DNC,"This is a well produced 60 minute DVD for the Tascam DP 004 users.

It begins from the premise that the listener/watcher does not know how to use the device and may not even know the terms such as ""bounce, track, pan..."" and so on, but would like to multi track at home.  It is an A- Z instructional DVD that goes deep into the science of recording, while not leaving behind those who are new to digital and multi-track recording.

The subject's speaking voice is clear and pleasing, and the camera work is perfect; going and out, with clear close ups, and simple step by step explanation of how the unit works.

Skillful use of a recorder does not necessarily mean that one can skillfully teach how to use it.  It is similar to playing an instrument:  many may be professional musicians, but unless they are gifted instructors, the student will not benefit to the degree which he might have with a gifted teacher.

Here, we have a gifted teacher, who has a strong sense of what areas may need some repetition or detailed explanation.

Since the DP 004 and 008, the instruction remains similar, though the DVD does go into specific 008 instruction.

Excellent for establishing a base knowledge of home recording that is skillfully produced, building in complexity slowly.  ***** Star teaching tool.",1338854400,3,1298,4.70353982300885
8353315,4,B0026P4DNC,"I got this tutorial DVD when I purchased the TASCAM DP-008 recorder.  Glad I did.  This DVD is very useful at getting you started with both the concepts of multi-track recording and with the DP-008 in particular.  The DVD was originally developed for the DP-004 (TASCAM's 4 track model which is very similar to the 8 track model) and most of the material uses the DP-004 when showing examples.  There is a brief DP-008 section that tells about the differences between the DP-004 and DP-008.  Most of the material is applicable to both machines.

If you are struggling to decide if you should get the DP-004 or DP-008: stop struggling and get the DP-008. It has more features (cool ones) and will make your recording life easier since having more tracks is better.

Cons: This DVD could be improved by expanding the DP-008 section, which is too brief.  Hence 4 stars instead of 5.

Note: If you are not a beginner:  just read the manual that comes with the DP-008 -- you will not need this DVD.  The manual is actually quite well done.",1330732800,4,1034,4.565217391304348
8353316,2,B0026P4DNC,This over-priced DVD helps but you can watch it all for free on youtube.com. It doesnt go much further in depth than the paper guide though. You just need to be patient and figure everything our on your own but don't spend over 30 bucks on this.,1294876800,18,245,4.23404255319149
