From  the  opening  to  the  close,  it  shows  why  Bon  Jovi  are  still  around  and  rocking  us  all.  I  suggest  seeing  this  video  to  any  and  all  who  are  looking  for  a  great  concert  video.  One  of  the  best  ever.  Keep  rockin'  us  all,  Bon  Jovi!!!",1238198400,,364,4.0
975010,4,6305165971,"I love anything Jon Bon Jovi, and I love this DVD to! In my opinion ""Live from London"" is not as good at the ""Crush"" concert DVD, but it's a great video to add to your collection. Enjoy!",1228089600,,186,3.9210526315789473
975011,4,6305165971,"I don't know if it is just my copy of this DVD but does anyone else notice pauses in the taping.  Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be and I am such a die hard Bon Jovi fan, it's O.K.
I was just wondering if anyone else noticed, and I should try ordering a different copy (mine looks brand new and was stated as such) or just enjoy for what it is????",1220486400,,354,3.8493150684931505
975084,5,6305165971,"I just bought this DVD and I've already watched it several times, with a lot of rewinding of their performance of ""Always"" where Richie Sambora's performance is absolutely stunning.  And since I'm such a huge Sambora fan and love to watch him perform, he did not disappoint.  I also have their Crush concert on DVD, which is great too, but they display a lot more energy in Live in London.  The entire concert is amazing.  If you're a fan of Bon Jovi, these two concerts are must haves.",1218585600,,486,4.488636363636363
975085,5,6305165971,"so i bought this as a gift for my mom because she loves bon jovi. i, on the other hand, don't much care for bon jovi. theyve got those radio friendly hits like you give love a bad name and livin on a prayer and so i never really paid much attention to them, until i bought this. the day after christmas my mom wanted to watch this and i said i would watch it with her. even though i didn't know the majority of the songs, it was still really good to watch, john bon jovi has still got it and the guitarist ______ sambora is good too. i highly suggest this if you are buying this as a gift for someone who loves bon jovi",1199750400,,619,3.8818897637795278
975086,5,6305165971,"BOUGHT IT,POPPED IT IN,AFTER ""ALWAYS"" I STOPPED AND THOUGHT,DAMN IF RITCHIES NOT ONE OF THE WORLDS GREATEST LIVING GUITARISTS!!!",1170374400,3,128,5.7894736842105265
975087,5,6305165971,"Why it took them nearly 10 years to put out a LIVE Concert I don't know.  Yes, KTF was a MTV concert type thing, that audience was not in sync nor 1 tenth of excitement.  This show is very fun, energetic and obviously somehow either on their own or coaching for nearly 70,000+ fans to sing, sway and clap all in sync amazed me.  The songs are great and the essence of 80's is there in the props and energy Jon shows.  Only thing is editing, a lil too much in the sense of Richie and Jon changing clothes right after finishing a song and starting another one, lol.  But no matter, the show and his vocals are pitch perfect after the first 10 years, makes you feel like you wish you were there and why americans can't wave our hands the same direction, lol.",1149379200,4,755,4.179310344827586
975088,4,6305165971,Great coverage from a time when the band was playing a lot of there now classic's.,1142985600,2,82,4.1875
975089,5,6305165971,"This is a great DVD and a great show and also a great band! I think there are only two things I would change...I would have like more songs in theis concert although the ones in it are great! And I think it would have been amazing if the sound was 5.1. It sounds OK in stereo though.

I highly recommend this DVD and Im looking forward to buy the Crush tour Live!",1109548800,4,363,3.9726027397260273
975090,5,6305165971,"This video is excellent. I've been looking for it for several years. I live in Panama and I watch it in 1996 but I've never been an internet buyer. This is the first time I get something from the internet, and I don't regret it, this concert is amazing.",1104624000,3,253,4.183673469387755
975091,5,6305165971,"I just loved this concert. I found the filming excellent. There was a lot of tight editing which carried my with the music. I found the sound sharp and picture clear.

Bon Jovi were all fit and singing at their best, enjoying every minute. They sang some of their best stuff and they had the crowd with them and it was an air of celebration. I just loved this concert.

I also found it better than the Crush Tour DVD as the audience was really assisting the atmosphere in London.",1102118400,5,479,4.311111111111111
975092,5,6305165971,"If you love rock'n roll, you have to buy this dvd. The band is simply fabulous. Each of them was at his top and you can feel it during all the show.

It's a great show and a great time for everybody who will watch this video. Highly recommended !!!",1098057600,,248,3.96
975093,4,6305165971,"I have never seen BON JOVI in such good ""shape""! I mean, everybody's jamming better than they had in the past 3 years, at least! There are only 2 things partially wrong with it... 1. There aren't too many songs on it, that could have been changed...and 2. What happened to CRAZY, or IN YOUR FACE?! They're not as energetic as usual, as hard as it may seem. But as far as recommendations go, I give it the full 5 *****. BON JOVI RULES!",1070928000,7,434,4.178571428571429

975194,5,6305165971,"What else is there to say? They're the greatest band on earth. my only reservation is that DVD's are made to hold MORE space, I don't understand why they didn't include so many more songs from this show. ""Dry County"", ""Bed of Roses"", ""These Days"" are all great concert songs and should have been included among many others. I also plead with the company that a DVD of their final Wembley Shows may be produced. Why not?",1012435200,4,419,4.454545454545454
975195,3,6305165971,"I've now gotten my hands on the Crush Tour DVD and this one.  Maybe I should have watched this one first, at least that way I would have been pleasantly surprised when I watched the Crush Tour disc.  The quality of this disc (audio and video) is [horrible].
That's not to say that the performance was bad.  C'mon, this is Bon Jovi for crying out loud.  They practically created the arena rock show.  The show is [wonderful].  That's a given.  I've wanted to get this disc for a while because it has live performances of some of their obsure stuff (This Ain't a Love Song, Hey God).  Those rock.  The problem lies in the presentation.
The video quality of this disc is terrible.  They must have used the same master as for the VHS tape.  Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they used the VHS tape AS the master.  Grainy grainy grainy.  At least I get to see what the people in the cheap seats saw.  When the shot pulls out, all you see are dots moving around the stage.  The quality of video doesn't improve at all during the entire show.  Too bad...
The sound is presented in Dolby 2.0.  You gots it...Left and Right only.  After hearing the Crush Tour disc, you'll be plenty disappointed with this one.  Now granted, there are about two years of development separating these discs, but I know there are discs from the same time that used 5.1 or at least Doly Surround.
The Million Dollar Question:  Do I suggest that you buy this disc?  Answer:  Only if you're a hardcore Bon Jovi fan (like myself).  Did this disc come out about the time they were switching labels?  It reallys seems like Polygram (or whoever) wanted to rush this thing out to make a quick buck.  There are no extras on the disc, except a ""video"" for these days that was spliced from footage of this concert.  You can't fault the guys in the band, they held up their end of the deal.  They put on a rip-rocking show.  Blame the producers for the way this disc falls on its face.",993686400,29,1944,4.354748603351955

975197,5,6305165971,"The whole band delivers an amazing performance over this three day concert event. If there is one weakness I would say it is the song selection. Though good, I would have liked to see more from ""These Days"" in  the set list. However, Jon gives a superb peformance that takes your breath  away at times.

7884185,4,6305165971,"This is one of my favorite Bon Jovi, concerts ever. The DVD is presented in the standard size 4:3 format on your tv, not in a 16x9 wide screen, although the video was shot in a 16x9 format. It projects to a standard size 4:3 screen, in the old letterbox format with black bars on the top and bottom. This is what they use to do on standard crt/tv's before HD widescreen came out. You loose some definition this way. I'm surprised they haven't updated this concert to the new enhanced 16x9 DVD or blue ray. With all that said, the concert is awesome and full of energy, the Dolby stereo sound is pretty good.",1517875200,,607,4.28695652173913
