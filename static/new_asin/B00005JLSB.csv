1466767,4,B00005JLSB,"Based on a true story, Catch Me if You Can is a story about a run-away teenager who learns how to deceive the banks and stay one step ahead the FBI by cashing fake checks and faking his professional credentials as a doctor, lawyer and a co-pilot. Frank W. Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) runs away from home after he learns that he has to choose who he wants to live with when his parents decide to get a divorce.
To support himself he tries writing checks to pay for hotels and food. But after the checks start to bounce he learns how to fake a check so that the bank will cash them. He does this by pretending he is a co-pilot for a major airline. Learning how the company operates he figure out how to forge a payroll check from the airline. He is able to stay ahead of the banks and stay ahead of the FBI. FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is in charge of bringing Frank in. Carl though is always one step behind.
The movie is based in the 1960's before computers. It is amazing to me that Frank did all of this without computers.
The story line in this movie went a little long. I felt that there were a lot of parts that could have been cut from the movie to make it move more smoothly. But the movie was solid and entertaining. It had a few comedy segments that made the movie more enjoyable.
I rate this movie a 4 out of 5 stars.",1041033600,,1336,4.1226053639846745
1466768,4,B00005JLSB,"When I came out of the theatre, my eyes were moist with tears.  This movie was supposedly a comedy for the Christmas holidays yet it touched deeply those who came from so-called ""dysfunctional"" family(statisacally more than a half of the American families) with the hurt and disappointments. The movie revolves around the X-mas time with which most of us associate the happy times of our lives, yet for some, those were the painful and sad times. The superb performance of Christopher Walken as the father of Frank, Jr. (played by DiCaprio) was very moving and certainly deserves an Ocscar contention.  DiCaprio fits the role perfectly with his boyish charm on the screen. The director Spielberg brought more than a light hearted comedy which can vanish intantly after the movie, and this one will stay with me (and other viewers,I hope) for a long time.",1041033600,,854,4.923611111111111
1466769,4,B00005JLSB,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Not quite 5 stars as it was little slow in the beginning , too much time setting the story line. Dcaprio was excellent, would not have been my choice in the beginning but he proved he is a great talent. Tom Hanks is the best camelion there is, and Christopher Walken stole the movie. Not one of my favorite actors but here he was golden. His passion for his son, his mood, love and even the resemblence made for a a very convincing father/son relationship. This was definetly a Spielberg signature movie: the lighting, the intensity of the scenes and the camera showing the marching seriousness of the feet to heighten the drama. I was never bored but feel the previews were a bit disorting as this was not a comedy by any means..loved the flavor of the time and the aniquity at the lack of our technology today...Poor FBI had to use a pay phone all the time while ""Frank"" was ahead of them all the way...but the human quaility was portrayed with finess and and charm....a very good movie indeed!",1040947200,,1030,4.508021390374331
1466770,4,B00005JLSB,The movie was well done as would be expected from a Spielberg movie. The story line was good and the plot moved along. My wife and I really enjoyed Tom Hanks as a character player as he played an incompetent FBI agent. It had an enjoyable ending.,1040947200,,246,4.25531914893617
1466771,5,B00005JLSB,"Steven Spielberg has crafted what may be his most purely fun, breezy film that is quite unlike his pictures as of late, or really ever. It feels effortless in it's creation as do the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio as our young rouge and Tom Hanks as the FBI agent assigned to track him down. Casting DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale was a stroke of pure genius as he can capture the essence of both age 17 and 27 with ease. It helps that Spielberg's team has perfectly not only re-created the look, but the feel and sound of the 1960s with ease. From the creative animated opening title sequence to the final frame, everything feels natural to the time it portrays. John Williams once again completes Spielberg by returning to his jazz roots with a soundtrack that captures the film and it's mood perfectly.
Frank Abagnale was obsessed with labels; not what they were for, but how they were perceived. Frank not only impersonated a pilot, doctor, and lawyer before his 25th birthday along with cashing millions of dollars in fraudulent checks, but got away with it. Why, because he made sure he was perceived the right way, had the right label. The 1960s America was much more trusting than today's and Frank couldn't have taken much more advantage of it. He was able to get information at ease, nobody questioning him why he wanted to know the detailed workings of both the airline and banking industry other than out of curiosity.
Spielberg would naturally be attracted to this project. It's a well documented fact that Spielberg grew up in a broken home and it had a vast impact on him as does Frank's parents divorce on him. More importantly, Spielberg was a bit of an impersonator himself as a teen. He snuck into a film lot as a teenage and pretended he worked there, I believe even having his own office. A couple years later he got a job there, at least an official one.
Frank Abagnale Jr.'s real love was for his parents and when their love isn't there anymore, his whole world crashes down on him. He was in awe of his father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken). They had the ideal life as Frank married the French sweetheart he found at the end of the war and he takes glory in reciting their story over and over. Walken gives a fantastic performance as Frank Sr., who gets in trouble with the IRS and his family forced to move from their comfy suburban home to a small apartment in the city. Frank's mother leaves them for a more successful man and instead of confronting his problem, Frank runs from it. He first starts cashing bad checks to live, but soon finds out he can get much farther when he remakes his image from a down and out runaway teen to an up and coming pilot. This was the jet-set age and flight was a relatively new thing and once Frank sees how high pilots are held in  the public's view he knows exactly what to do.
But the key is that he still feels like he's a teenager playing a game and doesn't come across as urgent or uptight so he's relatively cool when confronting those in a position to break his scam.  His charm throughout is his best weapon and he's a dead-eye shooter with it. He hardly has to lift a finger to get information out of people and takes advantage of their trust in either his youth or look. He effortlessly moves from one scam to the next once the previous one feels threatened by either the occupation or the government who is catching up to him or usually just boredom of the same old gag getting old.
Carl Hanratty (Hanks) seems to understand the mind of his prey. Hanks plays the character well and it's nice to see him in a role that can play off his freewheeling, humorous side. Hanratty  has many close calls with Frank, the first where Hanratty had him in the same room but was fooled like so many before him. At first Abagnale loves it and relishes his near escape, until he realizes the only person he can have a truthful conversation with is Hanratty, which Hanratty uses to his advantage. He's closing in and Frank has to become that much more on his toes, which he takes as a challenge and meets it for the most part, but does become that much more frazzled.
The interplay between Hanks and DiCaprio is really fun to watch. They push each other to embrace their own characters that much more and it's a joy to view. DiCaprio's fun, charming Frank is the perfect balance to Hank's boring, straight-edged Carl. They soon become each other's only true conversation partner as Hanratty starts getting calls from Frank and he calls Frank's bluff and tells him straight out ""you didn't have anyone else to call!"". Hanratty is getting too close and Frank has to run, but he has nowhere to go for the most part. It's no longer a game and he's coming to see himself as a criminal, not a kid, and wants to get caught but at the same time can't let himself stop playing the game.
I was really impressed by DiCaprio's performance; same with Hanks. Both of them, along with director Steven Spielberg, seem effortless in their performance and the film comes across effortless to watch. The story flows well and you end up feeling for not only our lovable criminal, but also our plain federal agent, who ends up the only one who really cares for Frank, even after all the frustration he's brought him. The end may drag a bit, but it's doesn't take anything away from the film and the time isn't really wasted. John Williams provides a nice jazzy score to compliment what's on screen. A perfect holiday film that isn't out to blow you away, take to you a foreign land, or change your world, but to simply entertain the hell out of you and it succeeds perfectly in that department.",1040947200,19,5630,4.490731707317074
1466772,5,B00005JLSB,"I had high hopes for this film from the beginning and was not disappointed when I finally saw it.  Leonardo DiCaprio is a talented actor, and he definitely puts emotion and charm into his role as the 16-year-old boy who faked his way into wealth by forging checks and conned through jobs as an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer.  This is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. and the FBI agent that tracks him for over two years, Carl Hanratty.  The interaction between Hanks and DiCaprio is well portrayed.  This does not seem like your average Steven Spielberg movie; it seems like Spielberg set out to prove that he can do more than science fiction.  This film is worth it to see.",1040860800,,696,4.448818897637795
1466773,5,B00005JLSB,"""Catch Me If You Can"" has been one of my favorite books for a long time, so, even though I'm a Spielberg fan, I was sure that any adaptation would fail in catching the breezily entertaining tone of the book. Well, I was wrong.
The film is a vastly entertaining two hours that is, in my opinion, one of the best film's of the year, and very possibly Steven Spielberg's best film. I think it may be even better than ""A.I."", and that is one of my favorite films. (I know, I'm one of only about 7 people that can truthfully say that.) Sure, it doesn't take itself really seriously and delve into complex social issues like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""A.I."" or ""Minority Report"", but it does entertain, and isn't that the point of a film?
The performances are uniformally great, especially Christopher Walken. And even though I'm not a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, I found his performance in this film to be outstanding, as was, as usual, Tom Hanks.
This is a great film that anyone who's a fan of Spielberg, the cast, or just a fan of good movies should see.
And by the way, the title sequence? Brilliant.",1040860800,,1096,4.430693069306931
1466774,3,B00005JLSB,"Spielberg opens his holiday offering with a narrative frame of his protagonist appearing on an episode of ""To Tell the Truth,"" intercutting shots of DiCaprio with 30-year-old footage of ""guest"" Kitty Carlisle and ""host"" Joe Garagiola from the actual television show. A nice device for ""motivating"" the story and establishing a sense of place and ""realness""--but also one that sets up an expectation in the audience: will Kitty make the right call?
Spielberg's script never returns to this framing moment. A small detail perhaps, but this film, like most of Spielberg's work, takes great pride in the details, the verisimilitude of time and place--from Nehi pop bottles to Mitch Miller's television show to the continuous use on the soundtrack of popular music hits of the day. The problem is not so much that many of these details are anachronisms, or just sufficiently ""off"" to be bothersome, but that the slowness of plotting and thinness of characterization allowed me to dwell on them in the first place.  Hanks' role calls for him to be a straight-arrow caricature with his face upstaged by large glasses and his deportment deferring to his padded mid-section; DiCaprio, too, is about surfaces, incapable of suggesting any of the addictive giddiness of the successful imposter or con artist.  The biggest surprise in the film may well be the nuanced, sensitive performance of Christopher Walken who, as Frank's blustering, conning father, is at once wholly believable and sympathetic.
The film will no doubt do decent business. Not only is it a star vehicle for two of the screen's biggest attractions but Spielberg pulls on all of the middle-class family-value strings that are his trademark, and he combines the genre of the loveable imposter with that of the persevering bounty hunter who bonds with his praiseworthy prey. Moreover, unlike George W. and Osama, Hanks gets his man. But at 2 hours and 20 minutes the film feels like it owes us more--at the very least the satisfaction of knowing whether Kitty Carlisle got her man.",1040860800,2,2037,5.059523809523809
1466775,4,B00005JLSB,"If you saw the trailer I'll tell you that this movie is as fun as the trailer made it out to be. I saw this one at a matinee but I still would've felt ok having paid full price.
Leo???? what can I say, in the past six days I've seen two movies in which Im ready to nominate him for best actor. Let's face it, a double nomination is more than in order for the crime the academy committed in not nominating him for Titanic. Even though I liked him a bit better in ""Gangs"" This is still proof that he's able to get past the whole Titanic phase. I love the confidence in his character. Young men will find him to be a bit of an idol with his suave, arrogant, womanizing ways.
Tom Hanks is his usual nice guy playing the nice character. Which is a refreshing change if you saw ""Road to Perdition"" He'll get some type of nomination just because of his name.
Steven Speilberg keeps his streak alive of 'I want to own it on DVD' movies. And would get my nomination for best Director if it weren't for that whole ""Gangs of New York"" movie which came out 6 days earlier. What the academy will definitley over look, the work turned in by Christopher Walken. Wonderful performance.
Make sure you 'catch' Jennifer Garner as the prostitute too. I can't wait to see her in DareDevil (feb. 14)
The movie does a good job of keeping you in your seat and focused. Its filled with bits of humor and wonderful acting. Even a lot of nostalgia that older people will love. Remember 'Sing along with Mitch""? yeah, me neither.",1040860800,,1501,4.270175438596492
1467006,5,B00005JLSB,"I've had this for years on DVD and put it on my watchlist for digital.

I saw this in the theaters when it came out and loved it.  I was never a DiCaprio fan but he did a fantastic job with this character.  He portrayed a conflicted youth who grew up doing con after con to get by in life after his parents' divorce.  To see what he had to go through was amazing especially to see how much he learned.

Hanks is one of my favorite actors and he was great as the stern FBI agent chasing down this conman.  To see him be so stern and by the end open up to DiCaprio's character is amazing.

John Williams' score lurks in the undercurrent of the movie and is amazing to listen to as the scenes play on.  Spielberg.... another home run.

All based on a real person and his life.  Be sure to watch the end to see where they all are at the time of the movie's release.",1523232000,,861,3.982456140350877

1467402,5,B00005JLSB,"Classic Spielberg. Admittedly, the story is interesting by virtue of its own nature, but Spielberg takes that story (which is a true story, by the way) and makes it a glittering jewel of cinematic drama. I selected to watch this on a flight from Europe to the US, thinking it would be just something to fill the time. I hadn't even noticed it was a Spielberg film! It was less than 15 minutes that I was engrossed with the story, and I said to myself, ""This is like something Spielberg would do."" At the end of the movie, I checked the credits, and, surprise, it WAS by him, and that explained it. Hanks and Dicaprio are excellent as two poles of a battery in this drama that covers parts of the 50's, the 60's, and the 70's, and is beautifully crafted in set pieces that support the moving story. It has a bit of an understated tone, which I hypothesize is part of the reason we can get so captivated by the story itself: we don't have glittering, non-important flourishes embedded, and we can concentrate strictly on the story, the acting, and the directing.

Do you remember when you first saw ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" when it was released in the theater? How it gripped you, held you, and amazed you while it told its story? That's what ""Catch Me if You Can"" does, albeit with a completely Earth-bound story. It's pure Spielberg, and I'm sure that both Hanks and DiCaprio count it among one of their favorite movie roles. Five stars. And get it on Blu-Ray. The set pieces alone demand nothing less.",1501286400,,1514,4.4855072463768115

1467537,5,B00005JLSB,"I've always loved those characters that are just almost too clever to be human, villain or not. The FBI chase and wanting the main protag to escape, all done in a very light hearted way that reminded me of the series Prison Break, but without the 11/10 level of anxiety. Highly recommend it and it's just such an interesting story you don't really want it to end, because if very realistically could go on ""forever""",1493510400,,415,4.546666666666667

1467641,5,B00005JLSB,"I gave this movie a 9 on IMDB but there's no way to post 4.5 so I'll err upwards because this movie is great - and well worth watching and rewatching.

I'm not going to rehash the awesome plot (truth!), great screenplay, and incredible acting, because that's all over this page. But my opinion:

***SPOILER AHEAD***

There's more substance they could have added. That's why I rated 9 and not 10. But standing on its own, this movie is so well-done.
It doesn't stick to the true story 100%. The one point I don't like is that he gets engaged to a girl, when in reality it was a simpler relationship.
It could have been done equally well as a darker drama, or a longer adventure. Spielberg chose to focus on these few years of Abagnall's life so there automatically is a certain lightness that comes from lacking the bigger picture. But in its own merit, this movie is almost fun to watch. Despite the constant danger of discovery and deception, Frank lives optimistically and hopefully. That makes this movie easy to want to return to.

Altogether, I loved this film.",1489622400,,1066,4.56544502617801

My husband is a pilot, and he would take parts of the movie and say this wouldn't happen and that wouldn't happen  (and of course this movie was in the time of the 60's so it would NOT happen now ) and I looked at it from a mother's stand point. Every KNOWN actor in this movie did an excellent job and you get lost in the characters immediately. It make you laugh and be sad all at the same time. My older teens watched with us, and I did not feel too uncomfortable having them watch it with us; there are a couple of scenes where I said ""great"" sarcastically as I am a conservative person who does not normally mix watch PG 13 movies or R rated movies with my teens.",1459209600,,830,4.0181818181818185

1470127,5,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me If You Can has all the typical Spielberg elements - including action, suspense, and epicness - but offers a bit more of a twisted plotline than his usual films. The movie is about the con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr., whom I didn't even know existed before I watched this, and the FBI Agent who was obsessed with catching him. Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks both give amazing performances. Leo was definitely Oscar-worthy in this, pulling out a completely convincing, crazy yet charming persona that was riveting to watch. (Although of course he wasn't given the Oscar for it). Overall, you'll want to watch this film if you have any interest in great cinematography, directing, or just good movies in general.",1455580800,,712,4.892561983471074

Based on the true story of Frank Abignail, it is the story of someone who 'brilliantly' cheated the system... but what is so amazing is that when you look him after reading the book you see that he has more than anyone, exonerated himself. His contributions continue selflessly to this day. He is funny, more than brilliant and self-deprecating. A joy to see his antics portrayed, and an inspiration to hear him on youtube talk about protecting oneself. I highly recommend both.",1448150400,,562,4.864583333333333

The acting and shooting are (as you'd expect) nicely done. It is the type of movie that everyone can enjoy and few are likely to be disinterested or hate it. The reason why I did not rate it higher is because it is so light and the plotting is weak. I never felt the impact that separates the experience of movies from that of television.

1471367,5,B00005JLSB,"Absolutely wonderful and extremely well made film.  Dicaprio and Tom Hanks are remarkable on screen together, playing the cat and mouse routine better then any other performance before them.

 Even though what Frank Abignal is doing is illegal, we cannot help but love his character and find ourselves rooting for him every time.  The story of Mr. Abignal is truly profound and incredible to state it mildly, that at such an extreme young age he had been able to pull off so many schemes and stunts.

 There are few films that grip me, and impress me so well that I simply enjoy watching them over and over when ever they are on cable or television more then this classic.

 Dicaprio's character is a young teenager who's love for his parents, & the shear sadness of their divorce drives him to run away on a check fraud impostor scheme involving PAN AM Airlines.  Then the scheme morphs and changes over and over as he is on the run from FBI agent Hanks, including a miraculous method where he impersonates a lawyer & passes the bar in Louisiana.  Tom Hanks, as by the book hard noise no nonsense & no humor Agent Carl Hannratty, gets hot on his trail until everything comes crashing down.

 The dynamic relationship between the hunter and the hunted in this movie is played out brilliantly.  The best parts for me in the film is when I hear the voice of old ""Blue Eyes"" himself singing away in the background. ""Once I get you up there, where the air is rarified, we'll just glide starry eyed...""

A+ for this awesome film, and thumbs way up.",1433980800,,1543,4.5234657039711195

1471370,5,B00005JLSB,"Unlike most criminals, we all tend to like con artists or ""confidence men"". Con artists have to be likable, and they have to be so convincing that ""being taken"" never enters your mind. The perfect con is one where the mark never realizes he or she has been had. Frank Abagnale Jr. was one smart and likable kid who realized early on that a lot of decisions are often based on artificial perceptions which may have nothing to do with reality. If you lay in front of people certain visual clues which play into people's preconceived notions, including their prejudices (which can be sometimes positive), you can steer people into a particular understanding which may have nothing to do with reality. Abagnale decided to test this idea by dressing as an airline pilot. And it worked; he found that simply wearing the uniform convinced people he was an airline pilot, and therefore trustworthy.

After his parents divorce, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from home and has to figure out how he can make a living. He learns how to forge cheques, but he can't get anyone to take his cheque since they don't ""know him"". He has no luck until he sees some airline pilots with their entourage of beautiful stewardesses, all in Pan Am regalia. In their uniforms, airline pilots appear to be the equivalent of nobility, with people staring in wonder as they pass by. In the 1960's, people had an idealized perception of airline pilots as honest and even heroic, a kind of positive prejudice. If Abagnale could project the illusion of being an airline pilot, he might be given carte blanche to cash his forged cheques. Why not join the party? It's even better than donning a Superman outfit.

Through some ingenious maneuvering, Abagnale acquires a uniform and an ID card to pass himself off as a co-pilot for Pan Am. What he finds is much more than he bargained for. By simply wearing his uniform and carrying a forged ID card, Abagnale opens bank accounts, flies on airlines for free, even gets free room and board at the expense of the airline. And he's cashing millions of dollars worth of Pan Am cheques. Everything seems to be going his way until the feds pick up the scent of a prolific cheque counterfeiter and con-artist. Pan Am knows about the fraud and they aren't going to look away. Pan Am and the Feds know he is posing as someone in the airline industry, but they don't know who he is. They misidentify him as a young man in his early 30's. Abagnale is not even 18. The Feds realize their mistake, and Abagnale, to lose their scent, becomes someone else, first a medical doctor, then an attorney. And the cat-and-mouse game is on.

Certainly, in retrospect, everything does seem a little too easy, but when watching it, I bought into it, hook, line and sinker, just like I was being taken by a good con artist. A couple of scenes point out he's getting in over his head, particularly a judicial hearing in which DiCaprio, based on some footage he sees on the TV show ""Perry Mason"", starts presenting evidence like a prosecutor at trial. But Abagnale, having not been to law school, doesn't know the difference between a hearing and a trial. This seemed pretty realistic. A similar scene also occurs when he's practicing medicine.

This is just a great joy ride of a film, an incredibly compelling story, and possibly my favorite performance by DiCaprio. The combination of DiCaprio's performance, Spielberg's direction, and the fantastic script keep everything moving, making you believe you've been through this roller coaster along with Abagnale. In modern life, we often want to fantasize being something else, the grass is always greener in the other yard, etc. Frank Abagnale took that idea to the extreme and led a life where he realized his true fantasies.",1433808000,,3762,4.7301829268292686

1471760,5,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me If You Can (2002)
 Is it possible to go wrong with a film that features both Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicaprio?  Maybe in some alternate universe, surely not in Catch Me If You Can.  Hanks plays FBI man Carl Hanratty who steadily and determinedly pursues master forger Frank Abagnale Jr., the Dicaprio character.  The tale comes to us more or less intact from real life.  Hanratty and Abagnale are real life people.  Abagnale, the forger, really did contact his FBI Nemesis from time to time.
 This film nabbed two Oscar nominations, which should encourage you to see it.  It surely comes out at the top of the stack of the films of 2002.  It also rates a spot of one of the most entertaining and pleasing films ever made.  I liked the story and the performances by the manic Dicaprio and the stolid Hanks we seldom see equaled.
 We have a depth of other excellent actors backing up the two principal players.  Christopher Walken plays the conniving, disreputable father of the young master forger.  Martin Sheen, James Brolin and Amy Adams also appear.
 Of course having Steven Spielberg as director helps things along.  Spielberg knows how to frame a story to make us happy to go along and enjoy the ride.  Jeff Nathanson wrote from the autobiographical book by Frank Abagnale Jr.  Nathanson has a solid list of important successes behind him, including The Terminal filmed in 2004 also staring Tom Hanks.
 This four saw blade film lasts one hundred and forty one minutes and carries a mild PG-13 rating.",1427760000,,1513,4.709923664122138

1472917,3,B00005JLSB,"Lean, flirty material that lacks the emotional punch I've come to expect from Spielberg's direction. Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio are charismatic enough to keep things lively and entertaining, but their roles feel so stiff and rails-bound that there isn't room for them to add much in the way of extra spice. For the most part, the film's happy to ease back into simple escapism, embracing DiCaprio's shameless con-man tendencies as heroic and admirable, even when the repercussions couldn't have been pretty. Particularly uncomfortable is his stretch in residency as an MD, largely played for laughs, where he toys with more than just bankers' checkbooks. Christopher Walken appears in a throwaway role as the escapee's hard-luck father, but fails to pluck any of the intended heart strings and thus barely registers as more than an extended cameo. Satisfying at times, especially when it's inspecting the hard work and tireless attention to detail that's essential to such dirty work (not to mention the rewards), it whiffs on any aspirations to challenge grander themes.",1413158400,,1071,5.232558139534884

I didn't realize this movie was based on real people until the end when it details what happened to the real people in it.  I kind of cat and mouse game between the cast of characters.  The FBI searches for the sly Decaprio who always seems to be one step ahead even when he is about to be caught.  The movie has some touching moments too.  You really feel for Walken's character as he deals with lost love which he refuses to let go of.

However, much as I love the movie, after I read the book I was a bit disappointed at how fictionalized the movie really is. The fact that Abagnale himself was a consultant on the film surprises me in that he allowed so much literary license, so to speak, in the making of the movie. But, by the same token, it is that literary license that makes the movie so much fun to watch so I guess I'm not really complaining, just making an observation.",1410652800,,592,4.390909090909091

Within this color, 2-disc, DVD from Dream Works Pictures that runs 2-hours and 21-minutes, are two Academy Award winning Actors: Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. Both are brilliant in their respective roles. This unbelievable but all to true, motion picture from Oscar winning Director - Steven Spielberg, depicts the actual true-life story of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr. (DiCaprio) who... before his 21st birthday, became a millionaire by deceptively posing, as a: Commercial Airplane Pilot, a Lawyer working for the State Attorney General and a Medical Doctor. Obviously, this precocious teenager was a genius and also very nice and polite, but on the wrong side of the law. A master of deception? Absolutely. However, crime... no matter how well planned, does not pay! What goes around, comes around and you never know, who... is watching, who? Where? Or when? Because as the old saying, goes: ""When you least expect it, that's when it happens."" The cocky/arrogant criminal with a ""can't touch this"" attitude, suddenly... gets caught! No one, no matter how 'good' at crime and deception - they think they are, can out run the long arm of the law. Because somebody, at some point, will catch them. Do the crime and then, do the time! Even if, you are Frank W. Abagnale, Jr. - the youngest and most notorious American conman, that ever lived. He was so slick, that he even had the FBI constantly on the run. But, as past criminal history has repeatedly attested, past experience and having gotten away with previous crimes regardless of how petty, does not negate the fact that at some point a criminal and his deception, will get caught. Even if, it's years after the fact. Why and how? Because there is always a payday, someday. For Frank W. Abagnale, Jr. - who although brilliant, was a lying con who for a short time made millions with his elusive deceit... was promptly placed, on the FBI's ""MOST WANTED"" list. And instantly, became a part of American Crime History. This true-life, misguided and very creative teenager was definitely slick, but as this film will illustrate... not quite greasy, enough. Because again, not everyone can get away with everything, all of the time. So, pop the popcorn and make yourself comfortable while enjoying this big-screen depiction of a 1960's teenage con-artist who was so good, that he even frustrated the most experienced of FBI Agents. Absolutely entertaining and a definite keeper for your DVD collection. Nina Kish",1405987200,,2750,4.928879310344827

1473415,5,B00005JLSB,"I'll just be blunt...I very much enjoyed this movie.  It had everything:  crime, a suave leading man, a FBI manhunt, and a story not found in school-issued history books.  Sure, some liberties were taken under the name of ""artistic license"", but I'm willing to let that go.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr., a teenager who embarks on a multi-million-dollar fraud spree across the United States and Europe.  All the while, he is pursued by serious, hard-working FBI agent and check fraud expert Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks.  But this cat and mouse game is only half of this movie's fun as, while he is passing fake checks, Frank impersonates, among other things, an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer.  He also seduces various women, including the then-unknown Amy Adams, who plays a nurse in a Georgia hospital who becomes Frank's fiance for a time.  Seriously, how can having Amy Adams in a film ever be a bad thing?  Well, Miss Adams stands among many fine talents in this film, including Christopher Walken, who steers clear of any comedy in this film and performs quite naturally even without it, and Martin Sheen, who, like Amy Adams, can do no wrong in my eyes, though it is nice to see him actually making an effort to do no wrong and succeeding in that venture.  In fact, none of the cast go wrong in this film.  Even characters who we see on the screen for five minutes or less are enjoyable to watch and that just adds to how worthwhile this film is.  As for the changes made to the truth under ""artistic license"", I'm just gonna overlook those and give this film my praise and full recommendation.  Though could someone explain to me why I enjoyed the scene with the discussion about The Flash so much?  I can't figure that one out.  Nevertheless...enjoy.",1402617600,,1788,4.649681528662421

1473422,5,B00005JLSB,"I purchased this rental of Catch Me If You Can (inspired by a true life story) on April 11, 2014 to complement my purchases of two other Leonardo DiCaprio movies (J. Edgar and Aviator). Catch Me If You Can is a movie that captures the film interactions of Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hanks. DiCaprio plays the character of Frank Abagnale, who is listed along to have successfully  posed (for a brief time) as a pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Hanks plays the FBI official tasked with going after him. Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, and Martin Sheen are also featured in Catch Me If You Can. The following facts are listed at the end of Catch Me If You Can.:
Frank Abagnale has been married for 26 years, he has three sons and lives a quiet life in the Midwest. Since his release from prison in 1974, Frank has helped the FBI capture some of the worlds most elusive check forgers, counterfeiters, and is considered one of the worlds top experts on bank fraud and forgery.
Frank has designed many of the secure checks that banks and Fortune 500 companies use every day. For his services, these companies pay Frank Abagnale millions of dollars per year. Frank and Carl (the FBI official who was tasked with pursuing him) remain close friends to this day.",1400025600,3,1245,4.582959641255606

1473519,5,B00005JLSB,"""Catch Me if You Can"" is the story of con artist and adventurer Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is pursued by FBI detective Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Along the way Abagnale manages to forge millions of dollars of checks and con people in other ways, while systematically eluding the authorities. And that pretty much is the story line. So, if you're looking for a story with a deep plot, highly developed characters, and some profound message, look elsewhere. However, if you want an evening of really great entertainment, this is an ideal movie. It's consistently fast moving. And Abagnale, the protagonist, is a surprisingly sympathetic figure. One starts hoping that he will continue to get away with eluding the authorities, which he does consistently. Perhaps it's because Abagnale is so carefree, so youthful, and so exuberant, and thus appeals to that almost innocent youthfulness that never fully leaves us, no matter how old we are. This is one of DiCaprio's best roles.",1398124800,,988,5.104938271604938

The transfer to blu-ray looks as if it has been upscaled from a DVD, rather than scanned anew. The windows in all the scenes are blown out and wash out the picture. The scan makes the lighting seem shoddy. It is terrible.

1473602,4,B00005JLSB,"As has been said numerous times, if you go to the movies for a history lesson, something must be seriously wrong with you.

As a movie, this is more than entertaining.  Tom Hanks puts on a heck of a showing as an FBI agent on the trail of DiCaprio.  DiCaprio, a once small time paper hanger and imposter make the bigs by swindling banks out of their money passing bogus payroll checks.

Frank begins his career as an imposter by donning the suit of a TWA airline pilot.  Gaining confidence he soon learns he can dead head (catch free flights) across the world.  Turning his two best traits, passing bad paper and convincing people he's someone other than who he is, he goes on a world wide tour of impersonation and swindling.

While the movie strays often from Frank's life, it does a fairly good job of portraying what a con man he was within the time given to show the movie.",1396656000,,878,4.382716049382716

This is the story of how Frank turned to check fraud and his many escapades before FBI agent Carl Hanratty finally caught and reformed him.  It is definitely a fun ride that I whole-heartedly endorse.

At the same time, a careful look at Frank's biography reveals that this is definitely the Hollywood edition of his life:  the movie makes many changes.  So treat it as more of a fun movie than as history.

1474492,5,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me if You Can is a fun ride based on the true life adventures of Frank Abagnale Jr. who, starting at the ripe old age of 16, posed as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer (actually passing the bar) and wrote over 4 million in phony checks by the time he was 19 years old. I have read Mr. Abagnales book and it is truly an amazing story. The screenwriter did a very good job of turning what could have been just one escapade after another into a thoughtful story of a young, smart, highly sensitive boy who was traumatized by his parents divorce, ran away when forced to choose between his two parents, and got caught up in a web of deception which took on a life of its own. Spielberg had to leave a lot of the details of the story out of the movie in order to more fully explore the motivations of the characters. I think this made the movie more interesting and added a serious dimension to what otherwise might have been fluff. After Schlinders List, I believe this is Spielbergs best film. Great acting by all, especially Christopher Walken. Wonderful cinematography. The set design & costumes envelop you in the 60's. Perhaps the real star of this film, however, is the original score by John Williams.....very sophisticated! In every way a real treat of a movie!",1372636800,,1268,4.423076923076923
1474493,4,B00005JLSB,Good acting and very intrigueing. I enjoyed this movie.  It is light entertainment and fun to watch.  Great ending too!,1372550400,,119,4.9
1474494,3,B00005JLSB,"Sexual exploits could have been eluded to, not displayed, and no real content would have been lost- come on Spielberg you are better than that!",1372118400,,143,4.76
1474495,5,B00005JLSB,"The Abagnales divorce because of cheating. They ask Frank Jr. to pick a side, and he does. He picks his dad. Frank takes his father's con-man lifestyle and turns it up to eleven, partly to run away from trouble, and partly to give his dad his Cadillac back. Life has been unfair to him--he's lost his business, his reputation and his wife. Except that as Frank spends 4 years fleeing an exuberantly filmed ticker tape parade of phony checks, he realizes that his dad was the cheater. You don't want to see it because he's so loving, but his dad charmed and manipulated the world before it ever had a chance to be fair.

Frank is chased by the FBI throughout the movie, but his conflicts are all internal: the excitement of lying and the longing to be honest; the joy of creativity and the loneliness of living a lie.

(Frank and Agent Handratty, both alone in the dark on Christmas Eve, when Frank tells him honestly where he is, and Handratty says, ""you don't have anyone else to call."")

People watch this movie and say they loved it--but not because it was any good! Those people are wrong. This is one of the best movies ever made. Every performance is filled with charm and sincerity. The score is lively and clever but never manipulative. The cinematography is drop dead gorgeous. This movie is hosed down in light and color. It's like light and color making out for two and a half hours.

Mostly, the power of this movie comes from the fact that Frank grows up while pretending to be a grownup, so all his intense coming-of-age moments are tinged with nostalgia even as he's experiencing them for the first time. No one is surprised that Spielberg does that with perfect sincerity. You might be surprised that he also makes it funny.

Also, that era in the sixties that we all know was corrupt and broken inside, just underneath its veneer of side parts and big cars? That's put across with honesty, yet without any cynicism or irony. That a movie could feel so lighthearted while doing all that is practically miraculous.",1372032000,2,2029,4.578512396694215

In addition to the fascinating based-on-a-true-story plot I really liked the sub theme of his seeking a father figure and finding it in a most unexpected manner. I also loved that even though right upfront the movie tell you where it is headed, it has many twist, turns, and surprises. Great performances by all of the multidimensional main characters.

1474678,5,B00005JLSB,"I won't get into too many details as prior positive reviews of this movie are 99% correct in my opinion. Extremely entertaining and well acted. Hanks is, as always, superb and DiCaprio is an excellent actor and just keeps getting better. The story centers around a con-man (child), played by DiCaprio and an FBI agent (Hanks) trying to capture him. Well timed comedy mixed with some edge of your seat drama sets this movie apart from others of the same genre. Should also mention this is based on a true story and you find yourself rooting for the bad guy most of the movie. Spielberg directed and as always, he hits the mark.

Christopher Walken is excellent and Martin Sheen, while playing a smaller role, nails it as usual. Great soundtrack and photography really take you back to the era the film was portraying (60's).

Recommended to just about anyone who enjoys a good story, mixed with some underlying emotion and comedy.

He might not have spent his time in school but he got enough experience to land him a good government job when he done doing his jail time after he's  f i n a lly  caught.

He gets away with it for a long time--eventually, the law catches up with him, still things don't turn out so bad for him.  In the meantime we follow a rather unbelievable set of circumstances that this character creates for himself and quite interesting and comical.

The one negative for me was that, because it was done out of chronological order, you know the outcome early on. Perhaps this was done b/c the writer expected the audience to be familiar with the actual facts, but I was not so would have enjoyed the suspense.

Leo DiCaprio is amazing, showing the birth of one of the the countries all-time best con men, in a time when it was relatively easy to do. Tom Hanks is equally as good as the guy who's chasing him, showing once again why he has the reputation that he does. This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time, don't be a fool, you have to see this!",1361664000,,526,3.834862385321101
1474889,4,B00005JLSB,"From a cinematic/story-telling perspective, I consider this a fascinating movie.  The story is based on the late teen years of Frank Abagnale, who committed check fraud to an incredible degree and kept taking on different false identities and jobs around the U.S.  It must have been quite a challenge to put this remarkable story into a movie format.  Though I wanted to see more of the complex details of how he pulled off his impersonations, I think that would have been very hard to do and still keep the movie flowing quickly.  There are many suspenseful moments and a lot of interesting tension in the relationships Frank has with his family, girlfriends, employers and fellow employees, and with his FBI nemesis (Tom Hanks).  I like it that director Spielberg used the symbolism of a tumbling washer at a laundromat to signify a love affair Frank is having, rather than nudity.  The movie did not need all the bad language, though (which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5).  The irony is excellent at the end when Frank gets out of prison by working for the FBI in the department of ""check fraud"", and you see him through the window blinds, sitting in an office, the prison he's created for himself!  I also like Christopher Walken's performance as Frank's father.",1360800000,,1274,4.707207207207207

1475058,5,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me If You Can has a lot going for it. For starters, it has excellent casting. The two leading actors were superb in their roles as a check forging con man (DiCaprio), and a persistent FBI agent (Hanks). Leonardo DiCaprio seems to get a bad rap from some people. They say that he plays himself in every role. I disagree. I think he's one of the premiere talents in the business today, and obviously he is. He's worked with most of the best directors making movies today. Tom Hanks is a dependable guy. We can always rest assured that he's going to bring his A-game to every project. This is no different. I feel that I must mention another great performance by Christopher Walken. Even Jennifer Garner and Amy Adams were pretty nice in their small supporting roles. Steven Spielberg is quite versatile. He has dipped his toes into just about every genre, and has done an outstanding job in most. Science Fiction, Drama, Horror, Action, Mystery, Comedy, and even Animation. What can't he do? The pacing and direction is very well done here. The movie moves along smoothly. It's not short (about two and a half hours), but never seemed lag. I also liked the camera work, and music.

John Williams is the best. I say the same about Hans Zimmer, but today, John Williams is my favorite score composer. The musical themes kept making me think about Spy vs. Spy. The feeling of a cat-and-mouse chase was always present. That was the best aspect of the film. The dialogue and screenplay is great as well. It's based on a true story, and that was a surprise to me when I sat down to watch it. The subject matter is serious, but the film felt somewhat whimsical for the most part. It's not whimsical to the point of being comedic, but it still remained pretty light hearted. In other words, it was fun. But fun is not always the best thing for a movie. There are also a nice amount of scenes that get your heart rate slightly elevated. I say slightly, because it was never very thrilling. Even in the dramatic scenes, most of them ended in a light hearted way. If there was anything I would complain about in this movie, it would be that. I wanted to feel more of a fear that Frank was in danger. I never felt like what he was doing, or him getting caught by the FBI was dangerous. That whimsy ended up plaguing the entire film for me. Nevertheless, I still thoroughly enjoyed it, and it's definitely worth a watch, and even further viewings. Great movie.",1342396800,,2451,4.483221476510067

1475124,5,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me If You Can, 2002 film

The story begins with an edited game show ""To Tell the Truth"". Which of the three is ""Frank William Abagnale"", the most daring confidence man under nineteen? He was caught in 1969 France and extradited to America. In 1963 his father Frank Sr. spoke at a Rotary dinner about his life. Later he got a loan from a bank but the family moved to an apartment. [Note the locks on the door.] Frank Jr. goes to a new high school, and impersonates the teacher of a French class! There is a surprise visitor at home, but Frank won't tell. His grandmother comes for a visit, his parents are divorcing. ""Everything will be ok."" ""Is it ok if I write you a check?"" Frank uses forged identification to pass a bad check (and failing). He studied the actions of airline pilots and learned their jargon. Next he orders a uniform. [Note the period automobiles on the street.] Frank has no problems in cashing checks or paying by check now. He forges another check.

By knowing the jargon the ""Skywayman"" gets a free airplane ride as a deadhead. Frank learns the technical details of bank checking. He bought a used checkwriter machine to create authenticity. The MICR routing is in the numbers, a check from across the country won't be bounced for two weeks. Now the FBI is looking for him. His father has troubles with the IRS. An FBI team follows the forged checks to a motel; he is still there! There is a surprising meeting in the motel room. [There is unconscious humor here.] FBI agent Carl Hanratty has seen his face and can identify him. Later he buys new suits and meets a former model. ""How much would you pay?"" Frank has another check handy. On Christmas he makes a personal call to Carl Hanratty. ""You're gonna get caught."" A young waiter gives Carl a clue from a comic book - ""he's a kid"", his prints aren't in the system! They make a list of runaways and start a search. Frank's mother has a yearbook with his picture in it. ""$1.3 million.""

Frank is living in an apartment in Atlanta. He goes to a hospital and meets a nurse. [Kindness can work with strangers.] ""You have really nice teeth."" ""I'm a doctor."" Frank's new forged identity is a graduate of Harvard Medical School. Frank Connors was at the top of his class. He watches TV movies about medical practice. But he has to answer an emergency call for a bloody accident. In NY Hanratty visits Frank Sr. and read the return address on a letter. [What, no mail cover?] Brenda tells about her past. Frank can help her, he meets her parents. ""That was beautiful."" [He can tell good stories.] ""The dog was dead."" Brenda's father wants the truth."" [Can a trial lawyer detect when a witness is lying?] Frank tells him the truth: he is nothing, really. How did he pass the bar exam in Louisiana?

Frank is now an Assistant Prosecutor. But this time he gets his knowledge from a ""Perry Mason"" episode and makes a mistake. [""The Case of the Jealous Journalist"" was first shown on Sept. 2, 1961.] Frank visits his father and learns the news about his mother. He makes another call to Hanratty. ""Stop chasing me."" ""It's my job."" Hanratty knows ""he can't change his name now"". Men in dark suits crash the engagement party. Frank tells Brenda about his other names and identities. ""Why would you lie to me?"" Frank slips out by a window. At the airport Frank observes the watchers. Next he visits a college to impersonate an airline recruiter; it's a plan to escape surveillance! Frank flies to Europe and forges better checks with older equipment.

But Hanratty surmises Frank is in France and living in his mother's village. ""That was really good, Carl."" Can Frank escape from an airplane in the air? Not for long. Frank got twelve years, to be served in isolation. ""Merry Christmas, Frank."" Afterwards Frank offers advice to Hanratty on detecting forged checks. He is offered a job to help them. There is a final scene in the airport. ""Nobody is chasing you."" ""How did he do it?""
The words at the end said Frank helped the FBI capture some of the world's most elusive check forgers and counterfeiters, and is considered a foremost authority on bank fraud and forgery. Frank also redesigned many of the secure checks used by today's banks. [Did the trauma of his parents' divorce force him to take the wrong path?]",1323648000,,4284,4.565669700910273

They are now divorcing. He has to choose to live with one or other parent. He is 16. He chooses but is traumatized. (I was not traumatized not knowingly anyway; I was five). His deceptions increase. He continues to love his chosen parent. His grip on reality lessens as his masquerades become more outlandish. He is now travelling extensively but still writes `home'. He keeps wanting his parents to be together again but by now, his other parent has remarried. He finds out. He is in disbelief; simply not acceding to the possibility. More deceptions lead eventually to capture. He even escapes that process briefly to see his other parent. His looking through the window... is so poignant. It ends with his new parent figure. For me, this is a very moving story (with some personal resonance). The film is beautifully acted and paced. John Williams' music is perfect.

1475261,4,B00005JLSB,"The story is true. Frank Abagnale Jr. was a young man who, before turning 21, forged numerous checks and became one of the biggest con men in the United States. Catch Me If You Can is, of course, loosely based on his life and work, but it's still entertaining and fascinating to watch. Normally, I'm not a fan of Spielberg, but he's done a really good job with recreating the 50's and 60's. The costume and set designers should be given equal credit with their excellent work. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a believable performance as Abagnale himself, while Tom Hanks is brilliant as the Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent who is willing to stop this man from creating more fake checks and assuming more fake identities. Christopher Walken does what he does best, even if he doesn't seem to fit the role as Frank's father. Nathalie Baye as Frank's mother is very convincing, probably even more convincing than DiCaprio. Martin Sheen is also a nice addition to the supporting cast.

Keep in mind, though, that this is not a serious hard-hitting biography, but rather, a comedy-drama that doesn't really take itself seriously. It's good for laughs, and it does its job well. The only problem is that it's a bit too long, and it could have been slightly shortened. Catch Me If You Can is still an entertaining movie, and if you love Spielberg (or Hanks, or DiCaprio for that matter), then you'll love this one.

Grade: B",1279152000,,1406,4.6882591093117405
1475262,5,B00005JLSB,"Being a stickler for realism, the coming attractions of this movie had no appeal for me as I beheld the boyish face Leonardo Decaprio in a Pan Am uniform of a first officer, knowing intimately that gray hair and a cane was almost a prerequisite for that airline's cockpit personnel. Imagine my surprise as the story came to TV and I found myself enjoying one scene after another.

Decaprio plays, Frank Abagnale Jr., a modern day Ferdinand Waldo Demara, with a twist. He makes emotional attachments along the way as he starts conning and defrauding very early in life, at about the same time that his father and mother start to separate.

Chasing Frank is a stuffy, Catholic, typical, white-shirted FBI Agent named Carl Hanratty who seems outwitted by his prey at every turn, as he comes up one step behind. Frank's greatest caper, along with passing forged Pan Am checks is puddle-jumping on other airlines while pretending to be a Pan Am pilot. Ever the ladies' man he meets stewardesses and hookers whom he cons as if it is was the most natural thing in the world. But our Frank isn't content with being a mere pilot.

Faking diplomas from Harvard, he passes himself off as a doctor where he works in a hospital emergency room directing other interns to take care of the patients. Just to round out his curriculum vitae, he decides it would be nice to be a lawyer as he woos a prosecutor's daughter. With two weeks of study, he passes the bar exam in Louisiana. The only problem is that darned FBI agent Hanratty won't give up coming after him.

He seems to be the perfect candidate for a psychopath. His happy home is broken by his father's financial and business misfortune, His mother leaves his father for the father's lawyer, and Frank takes pity on the father who thinks the government is after him for everything. It is obvious he worships a man who is a failure, but still does everything he can to gain his approval.

Steven Spielberg's direction is as upbeat as the movie's tempo and dialogue. The viewer may develop a fondness for the pursuer and the pursued. There is a happy ending for both of them.

The real Frank Abagnale had a cameo appearance in this movie, playing one of the French police that captured Abignale in France.

The End (almost)

Sometimes real life turns out to be even more interesting than the fiction, and this was no different. I was more than interested in the man who reminded me of ""The Great Imposter,"" Ferdinand Waldo Demara.

The real Frank Abagnale Jr. made his first con against his father. He asked his father for a credit card so he could date the many women he admired. In order to get the cash, he used the card, told the garage to keep the batteries, sets of tires and gasoline, resell them, and give him cash.

He served time in more jails than is shown in the movie. He served time in Sweden, six months in French jails and a few years in federal penitentiaries where he escaped from one pretending to be a prison inspector.

In addition to being a ""doctor"" and ""lawyer,"" Frank faked credentials to gain a teaching assistant job at Columbia University in New York.

Frank's fortune changed after he was fired from one job after another when a background check revealed his prison record. He approached one bank with an offer. He would give them a lecture on detecting bank fraud. They wouldn't have to pay him if they didn't like it. If they did, they would pay him $500 AND tell other banks about his work. He ended up making millions.

He currently lives and works in Tulsa, OK, and is still good friends with Special Agent Joe Shaye (known in the movie as Carl Hanratty).",1279152000,2,3629,4.556067588325653
1475263,4,B00005JLSB,"Ok, not evil, but whatever.

This lighthearted offering from Steven Spielberg is superior to `The Terminal' but not quite as infectious as his beauties like `E.T.'.  It is fun and exciting and engaging, but I find it also to be slightly forgettable.  It is one of those films that leaves no complaints while in the midst of enjoying it, but it isn't one that you're going to remember three days later.

Make sense?

The film tells the true story of con-man Frank Abagnale Jr., who by the time he was 21 had made a living at deceiving and `stealing' from the government.  He was a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, all the while never being any of those things.  He was, simply put, a genius.  Carl Hanratty was the FBI agent who was on his tail for years, never quite getting close enough to catch him (well, eventually), always one step behind.

One thing to describe this film is `jovial'.  It is a happy fun film.  Within the restraints of the genre it works nicely.  It does lack the `human' element that could have really set this film apart (and made it more memorable).  While the film remains exciting and entertaining it lacks that gut punch that could have made this movie `mean something', and in the end it would have completed it.  That said, happy is what happy does, and happy does a lot for this film.  Not only is the plot rather boisterous, but the performances are all just so delightful.  Leonardo DiCaprio captures the suave and childlike adorableness of Frank Jr. rather remarkably.  A lot of my cinephile friends consider this one of his best performances.  I kind of agree, since it really capitalizes on everything that makes him such an endearing actor.  This is a far better performance than his confused turn in `Gangs of New York', which was released the same year.  Tom Hanks is perfectly matched here, for he really understands how to play up the genre here.  As many know, I am not a gigantic fan of Mr. Hanks, so for me to praise a performance takes a lot from me.  But, as anyone who knows me knows, I consider his lighthearted `non-baity' work to be his best (see `Big' and `That Thing You Do' for examples).  Christopher Walken may not be the most jovial character in the bunch (and he does insert the films only `human' element) but he nails his character.

Also, look for Amy Adams in a scene stealing supporting role!

All in all, `Catch Me If You Can' delivers a very strong and very likable experience.  It's a film that may not `stick with you', but it is a film you will have no quarrels with watching again and again.",1279152000,,2554,4.48590021691974

suceeding in reforming what some may see as a character flaw of
individuals who are compelled to that behavior. Indeed, much like the
majority of day traders on the stock markets), their luch will
eventually catch up with them, in terms of the odds the long term.

A major weakness in this movie, is the dated time frame in which the
activity was perpetrated, coupled with a lack of discernment in the
choice of the soundtrack, (chosing stereotypical, cheesy numbers from
the 60's and 70's). There is also a flawed filming technique, camera
work by the Director, that not everyone will agree with. In fact, ET,
Jurassic Park showed horrifically poor filming and presentation, yet
they made a ton of cash, were crowed pleasers and major attractions.

Another downfall is the script, and its flawed tendency to make
comedy and clownish characterizations of a very serious matters that
affect the financial markets, human lives, entire industries and
markets, which is counterfeiting, impersonation of other people, many
of wheom laugh all the way to the bank.

Aside from those aspects, I won't hold it against the director, to
release a movie that exceeds 2 hours vs. the standard 90 mins,
considering the difficulty in telling the story contained in the
book, encompassing a number of real life, biographical aspects.

It's clear that the cast was exceptional, played by Di Caprio who
brings plenty of world class acting, as does Martin Sheen, Chris
Walken, raising the movie up a notch or two in quality.

Reverting to the filming, there are just too many blurred, unsharp,
poorly selected lighting situations for this aspect to pass
unnoticed, or unannoying, suggesting a TV-like technique by the
technicians. The DVD transfer was not a real wide-screen release that
viewers were expecting, either. Also, the filming angles are much too
predictable, yet the movie does redeem itself in the odd moments
from its comical moments, that will show a split reaction.

The final surprise, is the rhetorical matter of how someone can take
tens of millions, and after 10 years or more, have nothing to show
for, as all has vanished in thin air.",1270166400,,2270,4.9762532981530345

1475343,4,B00005JLSB,"This is an interesting movie in that it is not only based on something historical, but it combines tragedy and comedy rather well.

Very quickly, we see that Frank Jr loves both his parents. And they appear to be a well off functional family. Later, a financial crisis hits, and their living standards are reduced drastically. He still loves both his parents, but we can see that he is starting to lean towards his father. After he realizes that they are getting divorced, he can't handle it and runs away. A gem of comedy from Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is when he tries to make Frank Jr's decision as to who he will live with easier: ""Frank, just put my name down.""

After this tragic beginning, the comedy kicks in. Frank Jr. goes from being financially wrecked to financially stuffed. First he impersonates a pilot. At this point, the FBI agent Tom Hanks comes in. While the movie leads us into cheering for Frank Jr., it does NOT make the mistake of allowing us to hate the Tom Hanks character. (We are also permitted a moment of sympathy for him when he realizes his team is not exactly an 'elite squad.') Tom Hanks and Frank Jr. cross, but Frank Jr. avoids capture. (This is when Frank Jr. starts taunting Tom Hanks with telephone calls.)

Frank Jr. then goes on to impersonate a doctor. At this point tensions are released. Tom Hanks has lost thew trail; and Frank Jr. meets a woman who he may want to spend his life with. A small unbelievable element here is that Frank Jr. and she jump ship just when Tom Hanks has picked up the trail again.

Moving on, Frank Jr. decides it is time to impersonate a lawyer now. At this point he is tired from running, but too late he realizes that you can't just steal $4,000,000. and call a truce. It is worth noting that if Tom Hanks had not seen Frank Jr's face, Frank Jr. may have had a chance to go back to a normal life.

The deception is understandably starting to wear Frank Jr. down, and in a comical manner, he slips under the FBI agents and makes his way to Europe. If I say much more, I'll probably ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it.

I'll just say it is an interesting end with elements of both sorrow and reconciliation. All in all, it's an interesting combination of history, tragedy, and comedy.",1251072000,,2277,4.422434367541766

First, it's an upbeat story of how an FBI agent helps a young man turn his life around from a life of crime to becoming a productive member of society.  Second, the musical sound track is one of John Williams' best -- the movie is worth watching just for the sound track alone.  Third, the performances of the cast are excellent:  Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale, the young man, Tom Hanks as the FBI agent, Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye as Frank's parents, Amy Adams as Frank's fiance, Martin Sheen as Amy's character's father, and even Frank Abagnale himself, in a brief cameo as the French policeman in charge of arresting Frank when Frank is finally caught.

This was hyped up a little too much when it came out so I expected more than what the film delivered. However, it was still a decent yarn about a kid who impersonated people in different professions and forged checks along the way. He did all of this in his teenage years.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays his normal cocky role while Tom Hanks is the straight- and-narrow looking FBI man on his trail. Although not a tense thriller, the movie holds the viewer's interest throughout the 2 hours and 20 minutes with the last half hour being the most interesting, capped off by a satisfying ending.

It has turned out to be one of my all time favorite movies on so many levels.  It is entertaining, fast paced, and stuff that is in the film which seems so unbelieveable, is made even more so when you realize it actually happened.  Reminded me of an old movie about a con man with George C. Scott called The Flim Flam Man, but this is a slightly fictionalized account of a real person.

Another thing I really liked was the attention to detail on the period pieces from the ""swinging sixties."" What a time trip that was for me.  That also brought to mind the old book ""Coffe, Tea, or Me"" book, in a time when all teenage girls wanted to be a fabulous, high flying stewardess living the lifestyle that is present in the movie.

But, the best for last...the companion disc was every bit as good as the movie, something I find rare with featurettes.  It interviews the real Frank Abagnale, Jr.  I would have bought anything from that man! He is the proverbial person who could sell iceboxes to the Eskimos.  An extremely charismatic guy, his life story after the period in the movie is just as interesting as in the beginning.  And the companion disk also separates fact from fiction in the movie, as well as giving great information on the musical score and how they filmed the airport stuff.

1475483,5,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me If You Can is one of those true story movies that achieves a rarity. It gives you a really interesting and intense film while still keeping its feet on the ground and not going overboard or off track with the initial story.

This film is based around the true life of Frank Abagnale Jr. who became known as an expert impostor, who managed to con Pan Am airlines out of millions of dollars by impersonating a pilot, a doctor and a legal prosecutor. In the movie it generally keeps to the core roots of Franks story and the man himself was even involved in the making of the movie.

The film is set out from his teenage days and shows a young man who has a talent of confidence. This confidence allows him to fit into any role he's presented with and at the start of the movie we see him impersonating a teacher, which ultimately gets him into trouble. He's a kid who idolises his father, a man who's in serious trouble with the IRS and is being cheated on by his wife, Franks mother. Frank Jr's parents split and Frank runs away to Manhattan with just $25 in his checking account. Determined to clear his Fathers losses and repair his parents marriage, Frank becomes one of the biggest con artists ever known to the United States. The film then turns into a cat & mouse chase between Frank & FBI Agent Carl Hanratty, but what starts as a felon being chased by a cop turns into a father & son type relationship.

The film itself is just incredible, the settings and the script are just superb and have a certain style and confidence very rarely seen in movies these days. It has real life situations taking place that to some would seem utterly unbelievable, yet the film makers display these situations with such a confidence (Due to them being true situations and all) that it's pulled off without it detracting from the film itself.

There's one scene in particular which I'm thinking about and it's a point in which Carl actually manages to find Frank and get into his Motel room while Frank is still there. At this stage in the film Carl is unaware of what Frank looks like and Frank, with his sheer exuberance manages to convince Carl, with no proof what so ever, that he's the man who's caught Frank and had him arrested moments earlier. Taken in by his confidence, Carl believes the story and allows Frank to leave the room and ultimately escape. Of course to most people this would seem utterly ridiculous but the way it's put together in the film, it works perfectly.

A very good movie that is a masterpiece in my eyes and unfortunately overlooked by many. Buy it or rent it, I promise you won't be disappointed either way.",1219536000,2,2641,4.459627329192546

It is based on the real life exploits of Frank Abagnale, Jr. who successfully passed himself off as a teacher, a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer all before he reached his 21st birthday!  He did this in the late 1960's.

Frank Abagnale, Jr. used disguise and deception to get away with his antics.  He passed off bad checks to finance his expensive life by targeting drone like people.  He stole the bulk of the money from corporations.

Masterful performances by both Leonardo Dicaprio as Frank Abagnale, Jr. and Tom Hanks as his pursuer make this an enormously entertaining and light hearted movie that tickles the funny bone.

1475487,4,B00005JLSB,"Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) had an easy life in New York during the 1960's.  He was the only child of his parents and his father (Christopher Walkin) made a decently living from owning a store.

All that came crashing down around him when the IRS came calling demanding more money.  As things got more and more dire, his mother (Nathalie Baye) filed for divorce.  Suddenly forced to choose between his two parents, Frank took off instead with the clothes on his back and a checkbook with a balance of $25.

Even though Frank was only 16 at the time, he was also brilliant.  He quickly figured out how to cash checks for more then he had.  That led to forging checks, which led to taking jobs as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor, all without even a high school diploma.

But things weren't all fun and games.  FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) was on his tale.  Can Carl catch Frank?

The movie starts out rather slowly.  Watching Frank begin his life of crime is only interesting for a little while, but it takes much longer then it should.

Once Carl really gets into the picture and the two start their cat and mouse games the tension really picks up.  And it is hard to know who to root for, Frank to get away or Carl to capture him.  The two actors do a great job of making their characters real and sympathetic.

The movie is based on a true story.  Since this is Hollywood, that means take with a shaker of salt.  But it is still interesting to think of a teen really being able to pull this off.  Naturally, with the advent of computer banking and added security, he'd have to work much harder to even think of pulling all this off today.

The picture frolics along for about an hour until, suddenly, it seemingly goes flat, even boring. And it's Hanks, working with the alacrity of Barnaby Jones and the acumen of Inspector Clousseau that's to blame. No recording devices, 3 agents at the party, no effective police backups, a literal crawl up the stairs at the party, a complete lack of aggressiveness, the ridiculous escape from Miami, all seem to point to a deliberate lengthening of the film.

1475633,4,B00005JLSB,"There's a lot to like in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN--the handsome production values, the unobtrusive John Williams score, the performances by a first-rate cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Charlie Sheen, Christopher Walken) and the fact that it's based on the amazing story of a young man who fooled authorities with forgeries and impersonations over a long period of time.

Makes me recall the Tony Curtis film, THE GREAT IMPOSTER ('61), which told the same sort of amazing story with a lot more exuberance. Somehow events never seem quite so extraordinary in the way that they unfold in this reenactment of a true story. Only a few times does the urgency of DiCaprio's escape from the man chasing him really involve the audience.

Don't ask me why--but there's not enough punch to the proceedings and perhaps this is where John Williams with his ""nice"" score fails to take the drama seriously. Instead of accompanying the more gripping moments with dramatic bursts of music, he instead goes for a quieter, sophisticated sound closer to the bland '60s sound of cocktail music. Somehow this deadens the impact or seriousness of the crimes being depicted and gives the whole movie a bland quality that is out of place. I never thought I'd be criticizing a John Williams score for being bland but so be it.

The performances can't be faulted--Tom Hanks is especially good as the F.B.I. man and DiCaprio does a highly competent job as the misguided youth. Christopher Walken makes the father an interesting character.

Nevertheless, it IS an amazing story--this man had to be brilliant to pull off what he did--in an age where counterfeit checks and IDs are scrutinized as carefully as they are most of the time, it seems highly unlikely that such a ruse could happen in the light of today's heightened high security--or is it??",1186099200,,1820,4.880258899676376
1475634,4,B00005JLSB,"Ever since putting out Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg's been sort of hit-and-miss. From likable outings like Minority Report to Munich to sort-of-okay ones such as A.I and The Terminal. Catch Me If You Can, a film similar in tone to the Terminal is a bit more accessible and it's interesting all the way through. But interesting doesn't mean great through and through and the film suffers from what I call a ""perfectly too long script"" where the film can't really be cut down but you wish it had been.

The film centers on real-life con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. who successfully impersonated an Airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and receiving the checks priviledged to such prestigious careers. Of course people aren't too happy and on the case is FBI man Carl Hanratty, an expert on bank fraud. But there's more to Frank than just writing bad checks as he has some family issues that he needs to have taken care of and the desire to keep running.

This is kind of a hard Spielberg film to like because it's more a sum-of-its-parts kind of film than looking at individual achievements. All his films, from E.T to Close Encounters to Jaws and Jurassic Park always had some memorable image or a musical theme or something. In this case, it's more acting that shines through. From Leonardo DiCaprio bringing in a great turn as Frank to the one who should've gotten the Oscar, Christopher Walken. Only real problem is Frank's chaser, Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. He plays it with an awful accent and at times you can't even tell what kind of character he's supposed to be.

Where the film doesn't really fail but just sort of stumbles is in its pace. This is a film where looking back it's hard to tell what could be cut since a lot of it is important to establishing characters and motivations yet it just feels too long, like a movie you want to trim down but you wouldn't even know where to start.

It's not even close to being Spielberg's worst (look to 1941 for that) but not really Spielberg's best but it's still a nice little movie.

1475637,5,B00005JLSB,"I avoided this movie for a long time, thinking it was a grim cops-and- robbers crime thing.  Well, it is a crime thing and Tom Hanks is the cop (FBI) and Leo DiCaprio is the robber.  But it's anything but grim!  Speilberg chose to tell this story, which could have been tragic. in a completely light hearted way.  The only terrible scene is in the beginning when DiCaprio is languishing in a French prison.  From there on, it's all up.  The colors are bright, the atmosphere is light.  And yet there's a lot of depth to it, as well.  It talkes  a really good director to pull it off so well.

First of all, the story is amazing!  We all know it's true; no one would make something like that up!  Then, the cast is all-star!  DiCaprio shines as a complex, tortured kid who is, at the same time, having the time of his life!  The relationships are touching and so well handled.  Christopher Walken is superb as the dad.  Tom Hanks plays the 'alternate"" father---as serious and humorless as the first one was charming and irresponsible.  Hanks, DiCaprio and Walken, directed by Speilberg, in this terrific story---how can you miss?

The DVD I saw had a bonus disk with great extras---including lots of footage of the original Frank Abegnale.  After seeing the movie, I really wanted to see the real deal and he is obviously quite the guy!",1173139200,3,1335,4.510460251046025
1475746,5,B00005JLSB,"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is definitely one of the most entertaining and intelligent films I have seen in a long time.  This is based on the real life story of the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr.  A con man who impersonated an airline pilot, doctor and lawyer, all before the age of 21.  He came by it honestly because his father was a businessman and con artist, who helped teach him everything he knew.

Leonardo DiCaprio is boyishly handsome, engaging and diabolical as Frank Abagnale, Jr.  Due to an unfortunate turn of events in his life (which I won't elaborate on, to spoil the plot), the young man turns to a life of pulling con job after con job, at just age sixteen.  Not only does he manage to make close to $2.5 million, but he finds love, fame and notoreity in the public eye, all the while eluding the advances of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI investigator hot on his trail.

1475751,5,B00005JLSB,"Spielberg's most recent films have emphasized ethical questions. This movie looks at some of these questions and more:

- Is it ethical or healthy to ask a child to choose one parent as more primary and beloved than another?  The boy is asked to ""just pick one"" of his parents to have primary custody of him.  This tears him apart and faced with the choice of choosing only one as primary, he runs.

- When your real parents do not provide you with solutions that make sense, is it okay to choose other father figures who do make sense?  When Frank Abagnale, Jr. finally encounters a man who loves him more like a father should, is it okay for Frank to choose to emulate him more than he emulated his own father?

- Why would a man like FBI Agent Carl Hanratty care so much about someone who wasn't even a friend or family member?

- Who should you honor?  How should you act?  How should you pursue wealth?  These are key questions this movie explores.

The cognitive framework of ""No slave can serve two masters, for he will either love one and hate the other, or hate the one and love the other"" is a foundational concept for some people.  It is a concept followed to support their religious, patriotic, and military exclusive loyalties.  This type of thinking scares me and misleads others.  The irony is that slaves don't serve one master. Any society that supports slavery ends up requiring slaves to serve many masters.  Slaves are subservient to most any member of the preferred class.  Further, slaves get very little discretion as to who they are allowed to love and who they are allowed to hate.  Those choices are dictated for them.

The ""No slave can serve two masters"" is a principle discussed originally in relation to the pursuit of wealth.  On its face, it suggests that a person cannot act like a slave in relation to the pursuit of wealth.  If they are a slave to God, then they must hate the pursuit of wealth. This makes no sense to me.  As if slaves had too many advantages already.  Now they're not supposed to even love the pursuit of wealth?  Wealth can be defined as a state of being rich; prosperous; affluent.  Wealth generally means that you have worked hard to protect your family by storing up resources and making alliances, reducing their susceptibility to hunger and desperate circumstances.  The pursuit of wealth is usually a healthy thing for poor people to pursue.  We all balance many competing interests.  And to pursue one interest does not mean you have to hate all the other interests that may compete with the one interest.  That type of thinking destroys relationships, progress, and health.

Adam was supposedly kicked out of Eden because he sought knowledge beyond what ""God"" told him to consider - he ate from the tree of good and evil, the tree of knowledge.  I gotta tell ya - most days, I follow Eve's tempations and try another fruit.  I think both Frank Abagnale Jr. and Steven Spielberg do too.  Pick a cliche a day to refine away.

When people are no longer treated like slaves, nor expected to act like slaves, things improve.  Whenever I hear concepts based on ""No slave can serve to masters"" thinking patterns, I remember my parents.  Unlike Frank Abagnale Jr., I had extraordinary parents.  They divorced when I was a toddler.  They NEVER asked me to love one of them more than the other.  By both of their words and actions, they taught me two principles:  A good parent, when asked to love one family member as more primary than another, declines that offer.  A good parent communicates equal love to all their children.  Maybe a slave can't serve two masters who have different and conflicting priorities, but a beloved child sure can.  Children can sometimes find ways to love both, ways that adults have trouble finding.  Both in the movie and in life, Frank Abagnale Jr. eventually found ways to love and honor both his parents and the strange and unusual FBI agent Carl Hanratty.",1161561600,2,3945,4.623919308357348

He worships no one so much as his own father, although the images Frank JR glimpses through his rose-colored glasses aren't so much reality as they are the landscape his father has created for him to see.

So, when his parents split early on in the movie, after his father's troubles with the IRS finally bring their family finances crashing down, Frank Jr is asked to choose--his mother or his father, and it's an impossible choice (which any child of divorced parents certainly feels in this moving scene.)  Frank's choice? He takes off running, hence the title and it's initial confrontation, though Frank's as haunted and hounded by FBI Agent Henratti (sp?), played by Tom Hanks as he is his heartbreaking childhood.

Frank proceeds to run from one end of America to the other, criss-crossing in a trail of bank fraud, check kiting and the like (he's a ""paper hanger"", in the words of Hanks' character.)

But as the story unfolds, and it's certainly great entertainment to watch DiCaprio's Abagnale foil society, financial instituions and school bullies, it's as much about the elusive things he's running *toward* as the past he's running from.  In the end, I found this to be a melancholy-yet-uplifting tale about a young man's search for authenticity, a father, and roots.  Loved it, through and through!",1149033600,5,1558,4.992277992277992

He also designed the checks that are circulated in the country on a daily basis.

Catch Me is directed by Steven Speilberg (E.T. Extra Terrestrial) and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (The Aviator), Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump), Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter), and Martin Sheen (Wall Street).

The film follows Frank, played convincingly by DiCaprio, through his younger years when his parents divorce, and his father Frank Sr., played brilliantly by Walken, slides down the social ladder and how this all leads young Frank into a life as a fraudulant and smooth con artist. He becomes a co-pilot with PAN-AM airlines, a doctor in charge of the entire midnight shift, and a lawyer. Frank's mission is to take back all the money that his dad lost from the US government, and its the no-joke FBI agent Hanratty, played by Hanks in one of his best roles, whose hot on his tracks and always one step behind him.

The movie is one of the most entertaining and funniest films I have seen in a while. Speilberg lets his movie flow smoothly and gives his actors enough freedom to let their sense of humor shine through.

1475918,4,B00005JLSB,"Having just watched the DVD last night, everything is fresh in my memory...  Was I disappointed in this outing by the great director?  Not really.  Even middle-of-the-road Spielberg is better than most other director's best efforts.  Tom Hanks plays geeky FBI Agent and nemesis to Di Capprio's devil-may-care con-kid (not really a con-man, since Dicapprio's character starts doing all these crazy things at the age of seventeen).  It is effortless and free as the story uhnfolds, not answering a whole lot of questions that might pop up.  Hmmmm.  Being that this is ""Based On A True Story"" does make it a bit more interesting.  All in all...a good weeknight sitdown movie.  Something to watch after a heart-attack MNF game to take the edge off the day.  Nothing extra-extra-special here.  Certainly not Speileberg's best effort.  But DiCapprio shines and so does Tom Hanks and that makes up for some lackluster script strains.  The fact that this guy actually impersonated a pilot, a doctor, and a state prossecutor as well as floated over $4 million in bogus checks in the mid-to-late 60's is very impressive.

1475919,5,B00005JLSB,"Oh, my, what a wonderful movie this is.

This film, a ""true story"" about an audacious and clever con-artist--his flight from justice and eventual capture--is one of those movies that keep Mr. Spielberg firmly atop the pedestal upon which he so richly deserves to sit. It's simply a lot of fun--a great story, well told--and succeeds on almost every level that film attempts. The characters are multi-dimensional, intriguing and all sympathetic; the pacing is seat-of-the-pants; the direction is artful, but never at the expense of the story; the music another gem from John Williams (and uncharacteristic of his normal brassy fare); the acting is superb (and I hope that given this, The Aviator, and others that people will finally admit the sizable talent of the often unfairly hated DiCaprio); and the plot is a gem.

One aspect that I love is how DiCaprio's character is an awful con-man, reprehensible by every measure, and yet is just so very daring and intelligent that he demands our respect and admiration (and, sometimes, jealousy). Also, in his relationships with his parents (featuring a great turn by the normally out-of-control Christopher Walken), the policeman chasing him, his would-be wife and others, we see the real human being, inside, his dreams, hopes and failures. In the end, we care.

Finally, the movie gets style points for its retro-60's opening sequence and theme, and the subtle points that you may just miss on a first viewing (for instance, DiCaprio tracing handcuffs while talking on the phone to the police). Excellent, excellent movie that you'll watch more than once. Highly recommended.",1130112000,17,1623,5.140151515151516
1475920,4,B00005JLSB,"Why is there no extras on this DVD? Not even a trailer, not something I would have expected from a Steven Spielberg film. Mind you, he's probably waiting until everyone's bought it, and then will release a special edition, director's cut, or some nonsense. I was very disappointed that there was no extras. I hate DVDs like that.

I was a bit unsure about this movie, but I ended up really enjoying it. I wasn't keen on the very 1960s credits at the start, and the film seemed a bit overlong, but not in a tedious way. It's the only one of Leonardo DiCaprio's films I've liked since Titanic, and that's saying something. He does so well in this movie! He manages to look really young (thanks to a very dodgy haircut) and then looks older, and really gaunt at one point. It was all very well done, and it was a very subtle aging.

It's a very intriguing film, finding out how people fake cheques, etc. How he managed to get away with it for as long as he did is shocking. And I LOVED the whole relationship between Tom Hanks & Leonardo, it was a very strange relationship, but at the same time, interesting. It's the way Tom Hanks starts off chasing him, and towards the end they end up being friends - and they're still friends to this day according to the end of the film.

The end of the film bothered me a bit, it seemed awfully sluggish compared to the rest of it. Thankfully, both actors manage to almost rescue the film, and keep it going, and keep you watching. With different actors, it might have failed. And there's a whole host of supporting actors, including Christopher Walken (fabulous as ever), and a very strange role starring Jennifer Garner! It was quite a shock to see her, and it was a very small role, which didn't quite seem to fit in with the rest of the film. What happened to the cheque that he gave her? It only took her a day to film - what an easy life eh? She must have been paid a fair bit, just for a couple of minutes screen time.

A highly recommended film, which will have you smiling right the way through, and will definitely get you in the mood to read the book. Maybe. Hopefully there will be a special edition at some point - despite the fact I'm a cynic at heart, I'm a sucker for these things.",1127779200,5,2234,4.286729857819905

1476037,4,B00005JLSB,"Steven Spielberg has a style, a straight forward telling of a story.  There is something middleclass and suburban about his films.  The temperament of the protagonists, their concerns are essentially middleclass whether the actors are soldiers of D Day or doomed Jews of Europe; their world, the well-to-do burgher world has crumbled.  He doesn't write these scripts, but he certainly puts his stamp on them.

DiCaprio is very convincing, playing a teen, and then in turn, playing an older man whether doctor or pilot.  I think that is a neat trick.  I've always thought that actors are the weirdest of all artists and possibly the dumbest in real life, but I digress.  Christopher Walken plays the failed businessman-father with the heart of a gentle con.  The son takes the con part and leaves behind the gentle.  His mother is an opportunist, a French war bride, so when things go wrong, she moves on without a lot of thought or feeling for the men in her life.  DiCaprio is attracted to criminality, a ""Paper Hanger,"" living in the swinging late 60's with a suitcase full of ill-gotten cash.  Tom Hanks, the stodgy FBI man is on his trail, but the boy is just too fast.  He can only be caught if he wants to be caught.  I digress again.  Mr. Spielberg is not Alfred Hitchcock, but he learned a lot from watching Hitch's work.  Keep the plot moving by the illusion of unseen cruelty, the shaking chandelier or invisible shark.

1476038,4,B00005JLSB,"I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed this movie.  The relationship between DiCaprio and Christopher Walken is almost as good as the one between DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.

The plot itself is very interesting, and I have to say that the ending was not what I expected.  The film definitely delivers, and, other than ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" this was the first movie that I really liked DiCaprio in.  I found his work to be the weak link in ""Gangs of New York.""  Hanks, of course, is outstanding once again.

Lastly, the film has some very picturesque moments, such as the scene with the 8 old school stewardesses escorting the main character through the Miami airport as Sinatra's song massages our ears in the background.

1476039,5,B00005JLSB,"This is one of the best, most purely enjoyable efforts from all concerned - producer/ director, stars.  It is a movie about a criminal, but so hilariously charming, you actually find yourself rooting for the anti-hero, Frank Abagnale.  Spielberg hits the bulls-eye in his presentation and laying out of the movie: there is a pure, giddy, adolescent gleefulness in how Di Caprio's Frank carries out his comically nefarious schemes and swindles. It's a movie for the kid in all of us: how many of us have not dreamt that we'd (as teenagers) liked to have scammed our way through scores of money, beautiful adult women, and take on some of the world's most illustrious professions with insolent ease? And not getting busted by mom and dad?

  Caprio exhibits so much skill and charm in his role, that we actually look forward to what new outrageous scheme he will conjure up next. This is one of Caprio's most dexterous and instinctive performances: his likability is much more believable and lacking the contrivances of his Titanic character. In fact, he's so good as a con man, one wishes that he, and not Matt Damon, had been cast in the title role of The Talented Mr. Ripley. Di Caprio has genuine charisma. Hanks, in another departure, completely embodies his FBI agent persona, while skillfully underplaying the unintentional comic overtones at being fooled by the wily Frank.

  Most of all, though, Spielberg has returned to being one of the best makers of manufactured fun that the movies has ever turned out. Catch Me If You Can is a delightful joyride, a seriocomic masterpiece by its still-young, grinning producer.",1118707200,5,1624,4.901459854014599

He's a pathological liar; how can we like someone who has stolen over 4 million dollars, and doesn't know how to live HIS life?""  In spite of Leonardo diCaprio's smooth performance, I didn't find myself feeling sorry for his character. Since this is based on a true story, other things became evident:  the ineptness of the FBI in the pursuit of this con artist; the gullibility of hundreds of people who could accept this baby-faced boy as a doctor, lawyer, co-pilot; Steven Spielberg still knows how to make a movie great even when it's subject matter isn't.  With that said, you should enjoy the capers of this brilliant young man as he goes from life to life and ultimately ends up becoming a millionaire by helping the government find others like himself.  Hmm..crime might pay?  Christopher Walken is very good in his Oscar nominated role as Leo's father, a con man in his own right; Jennifer Garner pops up in a brief role as a very high class hooker; Amy Adams is fine as Leo's love interest and almost bride; Martin Sheen shines as Amy's romantic father; and of course, two time Oscar winner Tom Hanks shows why he's one of the finest actors of our generation in his role as the fiercely determined, if somewhat ineffective, Carl Handratty.

1476042,4,B00005JLSB,"Having seen Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes in The Aviator(a role which I think will win him an Oscar), I checked out the DVD of Catch Me If You Can.  Leo plays con artist Frank Abagnale Jr., who in the '60s successfully passed himself off as several other people, among them airline pilot Frank Taylor, Secret Service man Barry Allen, and doctor-turned-lawyer Frank Connors, and wrote fraudulent checks totaling millions of dollars while he was using his various identities.  As Frank Connors, Frank Abagnale Jr. was a doctor, a prosecutor, and an Attorney General candidate for the state of Louisiana.  As the movie(which is based on Frank's memoirs) shows, Frank pulled off his act so successfully that it was four years before the FBI caught him.  He was finally apprehended in France, where the bogus checks were printed.  After getting out of prison, as seen in the movie, Frank went to work for the FBI's Check Fraud Unit, where his supervisor was Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent who pursued him.  Tom Hanks plays Carl, the FBI man, and Christopher Walken has a fine performance as Frank's father, Frank Sr.  Martin Sheen also is solid, playing Frank's future father-in-law, Roger Strong.  Frank proposes to Roger's daughter, Brenda(Amy Adams), whom he meets while working as a doctor, but Frank abruptly runs out of his engagement party when he realizes that Carl and his fellow FBI agents are after him and that he couldn't get rid of his Frank Connors identity if he stayed married.  Soon after, when he's conducting another ruse, this time training stewardesses, Frank flies off to France, where Carl catches him.  In the movie, Frank escapes briefly after Carl brings him back to New York, but he is again caught, this time outside his mother's home.  The movie doesn't give us just one reason why Frank turned to crime, but we get a few clues:  his dad's problems with the IRS, the breakup of his parents' marriage(which resulted in his running away from home), and his need to make money really fast in order to survive.  Also, Frank's mom, Paula(Nathalie Baye), as depicted in the film, did a little manipulating herself--for instance, she told Carl that she'd help pay the checks Frank had bounced.  The movie also is a redemption story.  Carl, who is wrestling with his own personal problems(his own divorce, not having seen his daughter), becomes a sort of father figure to Frank--and, as stated earlier, he ends up being Frank's supervisor at the FBI.  While Carl uses a ruse to get Frank to open up to him(giving Frank permission to call his father while, unknown to both of them, Frank Sr. had died), he eventually earns Frank's trust.  As the ending shows, in real life Frank helped the FBI crack numerous check fraud cases and formed a lasting friendship with Carl.  To the impatient movie watcher, Catch Me If You Can seems overly long(two hours and 21 minutes, not including the extras), which I think drags it down to ""only"" a four-star rating.  However, I think producer-director Steven Spielberg wanted the movie to be a character study of Frank and not just another Star Wars-type action flick--and in this regard, he does well.  Leo's portrayal of Frank--the charming con artist who at the same time is very human--is believable, and Tom Hanks gives a commanding yet sympathetic performance as Carl.  The bonus material on the second disc is excellent.  In addition to interviews with cast and crew members and the story of how the movie was made, the material includes Frank Abagnale Jr.'s own discussion of how he became a con artist, his various occupations, how he was apprehended, and how his work with the FBI influenced banking practices.  Frank himself served as a consultant on this movie, and his input helped give the film its early '60s authenticity.  This movie has a great story with some interesting characters.  You have to ""catch"" it.",1111104000,9,3881,4.861702127659575

1476201,4,B00005JLSB,"Like Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg must have been yearning to produce and direct something similar to ""the master's"" opulent 1964 Universal Production entitled, ""MARNIE"".  Just as Hitchcock's main title character, 'Marnie' - Spielberg presents a similar type of a psychological-compulsive-pathological liar and thief, only this time - the attractive leading character is a man named Frank Abagnole, Jr., who is craftily played by Leonardo Di Caprio (who appears as - like Hitchcock's ""Marnie""- a blonde, before both characters metatheticalize identities).

  Where in Hitchcock's title female character in ""MARNIE"" ends - Spielberg's identical leading male character in ""Catch Me If You Can"" begins - at least when he (Spielberg) attempts to exude additional depths and colors with subtle comic and serious nuances of the sexually charming ""catch-me-if-you-can-kind-of-like-Hitchcock's `Marnie'-kind-of-character"" channeled essence with Di Caprio's leading role.

  But here-in lies one major flaw and poses a question to the problem... When does a joke about compulsive thievery and false identity's go too far?  And when should we - the viewer (or voyeur), stop laughing at Di Caprio's Frank Abagnole character and begin to emphasize with this trapped animal in a corner?  I did - and far earlier in the picture then the rest of the audience-when Frank realizes that his mother and father will never reconcile - yet still refuses to accept this news from his Father - Frank, Sr. - his ""real"" Father who now works as a mailman (whom by the way, was brilliantly played by Chistopher Walken).  Frank, Jr. - upset about who and what his Father has now become -  runs out of the tavern and out of his Father's life.  It is when we (the viewer) sadly hear Frank, Sr. (Walken's character) cry out, ""So, where are you gonna run too, now kid... huh? Go ahead... run... keep on running... Where're you gonna run too, now?""  These lines are the most profoundly sad and insightful comment ever made about both of these ""just-like-Father, just-like-Son"" deeply flawed and sorrowfully hurt characters.

  I think Spielberg's picture not only scratches the surface of a Father and Son relationship and the ""lack there of"" in one, but the movie then begins to extol a chance of salvation and a future hopeful glimmer - at least for the son, Frank Abagnole, Jr..

Frank's often ""shaky"" rehabilitated transition repeatedly arrives in a sort of angelic ""serogate"" Fatherly type of way - fittingly and unknowingly disguised as the clumsy FBI agent named Hanratty - brilliantly played by Tom Hanks.

  After viewing this DVD you'll notice many additional compulsive patterns and similarities with Hitchcock's leading title character, ""MARNIE"" with Spielberg's leading character, Frank Abagnole Jr. The insightful paradoxical make-up of both characters - each strikingly mirror each other so complete - like dual shelf bookends.",1107043200,5,2906,5.3034934497816595
1476202,4,B00005JLSB,"The inspiration for this implausible story about a teenage conman who swindles his way to a cool $2 million before his 21st birthday is actually, as most people planning to purchase this DVD will know, a true premise. Frank Abagnale Jnr attained brief fame in the 1960s when he became the youngest American ever to appear on the FBI's most wanted list and his autobiography, published in 1980, chronicling his underhand escapades, became a cult bestseller.

It appears that Steven Spielberg was one of those readers, or at any rate, was inspired to recreate this story on the big screen by some convincing source or another as this is not an orthodox Spielberg film. It fits neither into the category of his most recent, darker themed movies, A.I: Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report, nor the large scale epics emphasising tender children's emotions (E.T., Hook), large scale historical drama (Schindler's List) or blockbuster thrill sensations (Jurassic Park).

No, Catch Me if You Can is something rather different. Ostensibly it is a dramatic comedy. Di Caprio is cast as the dashing, raffish Frank Jnr - except that his clothes for some reason are always a size too small. It is never quite clear why he feels the need to become one of America's most notorious criminals, but we are given the impression that deep family psychological anxieties play a large part - Frank Jnr is angry with his mother Paula who dumps his father for someone more successful and has a touching desire to please his father, Frank Snr (Christopher Walken plays this role to acclaimed success). Rapidly and ingeniously he passes himself off as a pilot, doctor and lawyer - sometimes through necessity when his is on the verge of being caught, sometimes, it appears, through sheer boredom. His evades his captors because he is so clever, but also because the finest brains of the FBI that pursue him are represented by Carl Hanretty (Tom Hanks) who, with his middle aged family problems, paunch and dogged rather than lightning quick intellect, frequently and comically lets Frank get away.

This is not a deep film but several issues are explored. Frank's weakness for women is a continuous theme throughout the film, many different types of women - high class prostitutes (whom he cons) and the naive, brace wearing Brenda Strong (Amy Adams) who's tender innocence captures Frank's heart for a while and he becomes engaged to her until the need to escape from the law forces him away again.

There is also a respectful bond between Frank and Carl the FBI agent. Carl respect's Frank's ingenuity and cunning, Frank sees Carl as almost a father figure and admires his persistence to bring him to justice. There is a clever solution that reconciles both these two factors. You'll have to watch the movie to find it out.

So a Spielberg comedy. The man has nothing to prove, he can do pretty much what he likes now. It probably won't go down as one of the Spielberg greats, but it is slick, realistic and the plot keeps revolving with enough action to just about justify the length (over two hours). The 60s theme is done well too. As well as the tight trousers, the film is set to a minimalist jazz soundtrack with some evocative saxophone solos from Dan Higgins.",1105660800,2,3250,4.838129496402877
1476203,3,B00005JLSB,"When the idea for a film surfaced in the creative mind of director Steven Spielberg concerning the amazing activities of Frank Abagnale Jr. there might have been more than a little bit of dj vu involved.  It was Spielberg who, as a young man fascinated by film, talked his way past Universal Studios security guards to watch films being made.

Leonardo Di Caprio as Abagnale Jr. interviews a Pan American Airways supervisor to learn about the careers of their pilots for the ostensible purpose of writing an article for his high school paper.  In reality he is seeking to learn enough about the lives and activities of Pan Am pilots so he can successfully impersonate them.  Couple his skillful impersonations alongside a genius for manufacturing bogus checks and the FBI was left reeling while he drained millions from the banking system.  His cover as a pilot provides him with the opportunity to cash checks in cities all over the world.

Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. plummets from a commanding community position as a successful businessman in New Rochelle, New York to a life in which he is compelled to scrap for his next meal.  It all happens after he has troubles with the Internal Revenue Service and winds up under the oppressive yolk of owing a huge amount of money.  After the Abagnales leave their mansion and move into a small apartment the marriage of Walken to his attractive French born wife, whom he had met during World War Two, ends abruptly in divorce.  She promptly marries Walken's lawyer friend from the New Rochelle Rotary Club, played by James Brolin, as Di Caprio's world becomes  shaken.

Di Caprio had seen his father engage in shady manipulations, and so he put some of his father's techniques to use along with his own additions.  Soon it becomes obvious that Walken was a rank amateur compared to his son, who has a genius for white-collar crime.

The film's dramatic high point and chief story thread is the battle between Di Caprio to stay out of prison and hard working New York FBI agent Tom Hanks to put him there.  Hanks is divorced and so literally married to his job that the white collar criminal is able to consistently reach him in his office on Christmas Eve.  They develop a respect for each other over time, with Hanks admiring Di Caprio's brilliant skills, one of which is master escapist every time that he and his colleagues close in, with the criminal admiring the FBI agent's idealistic tenacity.

The film, based on the true life exploits of Abagnale, heads toward the inevitable result of a confrontation where the criminal is arrested.  It happens under the most dramatic circumstances in France.  The story then takes another turn late in the film when the FBI realizes that it can use the criminal's white-collar criminal skills as a means of preventing  future crimes.

In real life Abagnale abandoned his criminal ways after doing his time, making large sums of money by consulting the corporate world in the area he knew best, that of security.  Ironically Abagnale began by costing the corporate world millions and ultimately ended up by saving it millions.

Martin Sheen has a role as a father whose daughter wants to marry Di Caprio.  The wily young man of many identities meets her as a presumed ""emergency room supervising doctor"" and then swiftly switches to lawyer after passing the Louisiana State Bar.  He then goes to work as an assistant prosecutor in the office headed by Sheen.",1105056000,15,3461,4.8074324324324325
1476204,4,B00005JLSB,"This movie is a lot of fun to watch.  Seeing how Leonardo Dicaprio's character Frank Abagnale transforms himself step-by-step from a small-time trikster to an international conman worth a million bucks is pure entertainment.  What's more, this movie is based on a true person and actual events, which makes it even more incredible.  For those of you who truly enjoys this movie, I recommend you read the book version, which is a easy, fast and fascinating read, and will take you on a ride through more jaw-dropping stunts by Mr. Abagnale.

Special credits to Dicaprio, for those of you who had groaned and whined during the three hours of ""Titanic"", this should serve to prove that the boy who tries too often and too hard to be a man on-screen does have real acting skills (if you're still not convinced, then check out ""What's Eating Gilbert Grapes"", in which he plays a retarded boy, or ""This Boy's Life"", co-starring Robert de Niro).  He portrays his conflicted character very well, who's naive, cunning, self-centered and love sick all at the same time.  Honorable mention also goes to Christopher Walken, who plays Dicaprio's father.  Walken carries the role with his own inevitable ""Walken personality"" (doesn't he always make a role by playing just himself in every film?), but also incorporates the necessary elements of a father and husband at loss.

This DVD also includes special features, such as commentaries by the real Frank Abagnale.  The whole film's clever and entertaining, and it's a good thing that you'll laugh more than you'll have to think.",1104710400,2,1566,4.9465648854961835

1476206,2,B00005JLSB,"I have to admit that I read Abagnale's book before I even knew they were making a movie of it, and I came away a little repulsed by him and his actions.

The movie follows his life story (and therefore the book) pretty faithfully. Since the man is a compulsive liar, I wonder how much of his lying altered the story of his life and therefore the movie. The movie makes him look like a creative, quick-thinking criminal genius, who turned his life of crime into a multi-million dollar fortune after he went straight. He's basically treated as a hero who was twisted by his father and his parent's broken marriage into an amiable but harmless conman. His criminal career is treated as a fun lark; sure, he did prison time, but afterward, all is forgiven and he becomes rich legitimately. No harm done. Except for all the bank tellers who cashed his bad checks, and were fired (yes, that's what they did back then, and sometimes still do today); except for the people whose lives he endangered by pretending to be a supervising physician, it's a miracle he wasn't called on to perform any real medical task; except for anyone whose legitimate check was rejected because of the damage conmen like Abagnale have done to the trust of strangers in this world.

Ebert refers to Abagnale's ""accomplishments"" in his review; in my mind, they were the actions of a criminal, and he gets off pretty lightly in this flattering portrayal. I know, I shouldn't take it this seriously, but this is a true story - real people suffered by his actions. Technically the movie is well done and captures the feel of the era perfectly with good performances, especially by Christopher Walken as his bitter, anti-authoritarian father.",1102550400,3,1708,4.728187919463087
1476207,3,B00005JLSB,"Leo plays Frank Abagnale, Jr., one of the youngest, most successful, and flamboyant con men in history. Not even an adult when he got his start, Abagnale passed off millions of dollars in rubber and fabricated checks across several different countries. Even more unbelievable, he was able to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, Pan Am pilot, Harvard graduate medical doctor, and a licensed lawyer. This is by no means a serious crime study, but a humorous and light-hearted look back to the recent past just before the rise of technology. This is a time when a charismatic grifter could easily exploit the common sense of trust and appearance to con the unsuspecting out of cash and just about anything else he desired. Catch Me If You Can does for conmen what Trainspotting did for heroin addicts. And not counting the jail time, at least in Abagnale's case, crime did indeed pay, and pay well.

Personal bias: both DiCaprio and Hanks strain the definition of the term ""actor"". Spielberg is a hack of a director. Despite this, I did find this film enjoyable and entertaining. I thought it moved along well despite its length, though just about everyone else disagrees and feel at least fifteen minutes could have been lopped off.

Catch Me If You Can relies on a longstanding and successful formula. Despite disliking crime in the real world, audiences love clever criminals in movies. In film, crime can be glamorous, exciting work. The Godfather, Heat, and Hannibal are just a few perfect examples of glamorized crime and criminals. As long as the criminal is generally good natured about his ""craft"" and doesn't needlessly hurt too many of the little people the audience will identify with him and forgive such moral lapses, though there are many exceptions. In this respect, Abagnale provides the perfect movie criminal, he steals only from large, faceless institutions. More importantly, he is never violent in his cons. This leaves the audience free to root for the bad guy unburdened by guilt. In The Godfather, Michael Corleone resisted the drug trade preferring traditional, insulated vices. The robbers in Heat also stole mainly from institutions, preferring low profile thefts and avoiding violence except when given no other choice. And finally Hannibal creates a great paradox, Lecter is violent and cannibalistic, yet the audience loves him and roots for him to elude the authorities. Why? Because Lecter is so regal and well mannered when not killing. And generally he only goes after those who deserve it in some way, he does not kill indiscriminately. These are the traits that make for a great movie criminal.

Leo as Abagnale seems to fit the part the audience expects, someone handsome and charismatic. These are important since many of Abagnale's cons rely on nothing more than charm and some quick thinking and fast talking. The role does not demand much more form Leo, except a few scenes of loss and sadness over the breakup of his family. Otherwise he spends most of the film wide-eyed and amazed at the relative ease with which he perpetrates his frauds, much as the real Abagnale must have felt at the age of sixteen when he first set out on his crime spree.

Catch Me If You Can would have us believe Abagnale's true motivation was the divorce of his parents after his small time conman father got caught by the IRS. Abagnale naively believed that he could steal back enough to buy back everything that had been taken from them, eventually reuniting his parents. True or not, this provides us with a rationale for his actions.

Christopher Walken plays Frank's father, whose life of cons apparently rubbed off on his son. Walken brings his usual skill to the role and presents a convincing portrait of a common grifter. He believes the government is out to get him, and actually encourages his son to ""stick it to the man"" so to speak.

Hanks succeeds in his role because it suits the character he plays best - a geek. Hanratty is a desk jockey, a paper chaser, not used to the excitement of chasing down a living breathing criminal. When he first tracks Abagnale down and moves in for the arrest, he's visibly shaken, the pistol trembling in his hand as he half-thinkingly displays his ID badge backwards to a startled maid. His Bostonian accent is passable, but appears and disappears intermittently throughout the film.

Spielberg loves stereotypes, and every character in this and all his other truly successful films have been as stock as my Toyota Corolla. They're easy to work with, easy to cast and easy to direct. Try as he might to escape it, Spielberg is a populist director to the bone. He succeeds best when crafting simple action and adventure stories containing flat characters with grand style and a dose of imagination. When he tries to craft something with any great depth or complexity, it fails miserably. A.I. is the best example of this, it was a horrific commercial and critical failure.

Perhaps he desires to transcend his proletarian roots in order to gain acceptance as one of the artistic greats (a Hitchcock, Scorsese or Coppola), no longer satisfied with mere commercial success. Catch Me If You Can may be a sign that he's finally accepted the fact that he just doesn't quite have it in him. Nothing fancy here, just good old fashioned Spielberg. I noticed plenty of heavy handed, golden light streaming through blinds into dusty rooms (I don't know what else to call it). That was the extent of artistic liberties taken that I could detect.",1101859200,5,5507,4.857294994675186
1476208,5,B00005JLSB,"I first caught the movie on HBO, from around the midpoint  --  and from there, it was like a book that you couldn't put down. I then rented the DVD to see the whole movie  --  and I couldn't believe how tedious the first portion was. If I had originally watched the movie from the beginning, I don't think I would have survived to where it got going. Rumor has it that Spielberg didn't wholeheartedly want to direct this film, and I think it shows.

But it's still a 5/5, because when it's good, it's very good. You get fascinated about this genius con-artist, you can't help pulling for him, and you become interested enough to wonder about a lot of things. I couldn't resist googling the heck out of it afterwards, to find out more about what has become of the guy, to find out how closely the movie followed the actual story (answer: pretty closely but with some poetic license), and most especially to try to find out what became of that nurse that he got engaged to (who coincidentally has the same name as one of the actresses on ""Desperate Housewives"").

Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks do well and are very good together, but it doesn't seem that the movie uses either one quite to the fullest; it's kind of like having Alex Rodriguez play 3rd base, which of course can have its points.

Anybody else notice how much Hanks seems like Dan Aykroyd in this movie? The role actually has some resemblances to Aykroyd's part in ""Ghostbusters,"" although of course this role is more serious and complex. Also.....anybody else catch the resemblance between DiCaprio's final scene with the nurse and his final scene with Kate Winslet in ""Titanic""? I would guess that this was intentional; it almost had to be.

My DVD had a defect at the very end: A final portion, lasting maybe a couple of minutes, got clipped off. I don't know if this was just one defective disc or if it's something systematic. In any event, if the movie seems to end with a clipped dialogue, that's not the real ending, and you're missing some stuff.

  Most people are propagandized to believe that great impostors only perform criminal misdeeds or impersonate a multitude of occupations they are illegitmately qualified to perform. However there are alternate variations of great impostors: (1) individuals with multiple personalities who may not be criminals and (2) individuals with highly ambiguous behavior, appearances and language usage. The English poetical playwright William Shakespeare aptly described humans in his phrase:  ""all the world's a stage"" and he uttered that we (all human beings) are ""actors"". The great impostor psychopathological syndrome is a catch-as-catch-can ""catch me if you can"" extreme application of this justly famous insightful Shakespearean quotation; for we are all truly impostors in our individualistically distinctive ways.",1100304000,,977,5.7172413793103445

1476303,4,B00005JLSB,"This is another solid base hit in the storied career of director Steven Spielberg.  The title implies a bouncy cat and mouse thriller, which to some degree, it is.  But it is just as much a character study of a forger/con artist and his pursuer, a dogged treasury agent.  There is a somber tone to the film that suggests that the con artist, Frank Abignale Jr., is not so content with the choices he has made despite the apparent riches of his profession.  In contrast, the agent, Carl Hanratty, is equally lonely as a result of a recent divorce, which is probably why he plunges himself so wholeheartedly in his work.  As Frank Jr., this may be the best work that Leonardo DiCaprio has ever done.  As Agent Hanratty, Tom Hanks imbues the character with steely determination and dignity where the character could just as well have been portrayed as a bumbler.  Christopher Walken also contributes a superlative performance as Frank Sr., a ne'erdowell who Frank Jr. holds up on a pedestal.  Where the film falls a little short is as to why Frank Jr. chooses the life that he does.",1097884800,,1079,4.612565445026178
1476304,5,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me If You Can tells the incredible true story of a teenage runaway who finds himself alone in the big city and in need of a job. He uses his wit and creativity to live the good life, successfully posing as an airline pilot, physician, and lawyer, and cashing millions of dollars in bad checks, all before he is 18 years old!

Leonardo DiCaprio is utterly convincing as teenager Frank Abagnale, Jr. His considerable poise and confidence charm us immediately. Tom Hanks plays the stalwart FBI agent who chases Frank for years, forming an odd bond with him. Christopher Walken plays Frank's troubled father in his typically eerie style.

Director Speilberg recreates the fashions and look of the 60's well and the script is riveting. There are many surprises and some chuckles along the way, although I consider this a drama, not a comedy. This is a very enjoyable film about an amazingly resourceful young man.

1476306,4,B00005JLSB,"At the time of this stylish thriller's release in the theatres, a reformed Frank Abagnale spoke at a university in the town where I live. The subject of hs discussion was protection against fraud.
 While I was unable to attend that lecture, I did have the pleasure of watching Stephen Spielberg's interpretation of his earlier life on the big screen, and while the film dragged in some areas, and was inconsistant with the book on which it was based, it was entertaining.
 Leonardo Di Caprio plays the young Frank, who sees his once tranquil home life shatter as his father(Christopher Walken in a performance worthy of the Oscar nonimation he received for it) falls on hard times, and his glamourous, wartime child-bride French mother(Nathalie Baye) responds to their decline in status by having an affair with her husband's smug best friend (James Brolin).
 In real-life, Frank had four siblings, and their responses to the break-up of their parents' marriage would have provided an interesting facet to the story had they been included. In truth, Frank's father was an honest man who made the mistake of letting his namesake get away with one illegal stunt, which helped get the ball rolling as far as Frank's life of crime was concerned, and there was a difference of a few years between the time of the Abagnale's separation and divorce.
  This fast-paced film speeds along to the beginning of Frank's life of crime after he runs away from home, but keeps jumping ahead periodically to the end of his incarceration in France, and his escort home by the no-nonsense Fed, Carl Handratty, an actual composite character, played by a rather blank Tom Hanks with a Bostonian accent.
 The film captures the look and feel of the 60s in the  fashionable colors, costumes, make-up, pillbox hats, and hair-dos, a well as in the naivete of those who Frank cons along the way. One supposes that the vast array of international crimes he committed have helped to make the world a more cynical place, however he may work to atone for them.
 We follow his adventures in passing himself off as a pilot, a doctor, and attorney, and feel irritation when Handratty fails at his first attempt to catch him, although Frank's slickness in talking his way out of an arrest is amusing.
  Jennifer Garner has a cameo as a pin-up girl turned call girl as she recreates an incident that actually took place at a Governor's mansion instead of a swank hotel. Her half-smile as she asks Frank how much he would pay if she were beings sold downstairs speaks volumes about how far she's fallen in life.
 Kudos must be given to John Williams' musical score which is hip, snazzy, and highly reminiscent of the music that accompanied many a 1960s spy and/or detective flick. There is something comical about that recurring note pattern played whenever Hanratty hits on a major clue that brings him further to catching his unsub.
 The Christmastime phone calls between Frank and Carl never took place. But they symbolized the lonliness and desire for connection Abagnale described.
 We reach a significant moment in the story when Frank meets Brenda Strong (a vulnerable Amy Adams)at a hospital in Atlanta, and passes himself off as a doctor. As he begins to spend time with her, he learns the young candy striper has been estranged from her parents in Louisiana, after they forced her to terminate a pregnancy.
 To improve her standing with her parents and elude capture from the police, our young con artist decides to ""become"" a lawyer after dining with the Strongs (Martin Sheen and Nancy Lenehan)  settles in with them for a while and proposes to Brenda. He is deeply moved by the Strong's closeness as a couple.
 There is one more meeting with his own father, and one more Christmastime phone call before Handratty and his men re-fuel the chase, forcing the young con-artist to leave behind a devastated Brenda the night of their engagement party.
 Fleeing to Florida, he waits for Brenda to join him as she promised when he fled. But when it appears that she is part of a sting operation, Frank drives away and cooks up the most impressive of his schemes when he recruits students from a Women's College into a phony stewardess training program, and dressed once again in his pilot's uniform, goes through the airport's lobby undetected by the Feds who are too distracted by the pretty girls to notice their man. I had to admit it was a riot when Frank's plane takes off just in time for Handratty and his men to realize that they had just missed him. It's the most fun scene in the movie!
 Eventually, the long arm of the law catches up to Frank and the scenes of his last moments of freedom are filled with pathos.
 The film ignores his incarceration in Sweden, but recreates  his last attempt to escape before doing time in an American prison, although not altogether accurately. But his recoiling from the image of his mother's new life, in which she appears to have erased all traces of her previous one is indelible.
 Gradually, the young inmate displays his talent for detecting fraudulent checks, much to the delight of his captors.
 The ex-convict who stood before an audience at my alma mater  had raised three sons who were very well-behaved largely because they couldn't have pulled any stunts that their father hadn't already invented.
 This one-time ""prodigal son"" wanted those in attendance of his lecture to know that he didn't want them to walk away envying him his experiences because there was also a lot of despair in his life on the run. He would prefer to be remembered for having turned his life around and raised a fine family, proving that even the least desirable characters can change.",1092355200,,5687,4.773700305810397
1476307,4,B00005JLSB,"An amusing if overdrawn double martini blend of scams and flirtation that etches its light-hearted arc with good old fashioned tale of a lovable rogue pursued relentlessly by a single-minded cop, who over time develops a paternalistic interest in his prey.

The touchy feely moments are fortunately never too campy and the cheeky ones never too risque. Most of the Oh-so-cool pilot moments are probably a bit dated (pilots being little more than commercial chauffers today, unlike their glam roles 30 years ago) but De Caprio oozes a dark chocolate blend of slick charm and lonely-boy vulnerability.

The opening sequence (of title credits) has a fabulously artistic Saul Bass type sketch video that alone is worth the price of the dvd. Which is great because the DVD has fairly few features otherwise.

Frank Jr.(Leonardo DiCaprio in a good role) starts his imposter career while still in high school.  Then, he drops out when his father(played subtly by Christopher Walken) has severe financial problems, and starts to learn how to pass off bad checks.  He comes up with the idea to pose as a Pan-Am pilot, and uses a new scheme taking advantage of routing numbers.  Hoping to find the con-man, is Carl Henrietty(Tom Hanks).  There are a few close calls where Carl nearly catchs Frank, and Frank always calls Carl on Christmas(which leads to his undoing).  Frank also impersonates a lawyer and a doctor on his crime spree, and meets a woman that he falls in love with(Amy Adams).  Frank meets the girl's father(Martin Sheen in a great cameo), who is estanged from her.  Frank nearly marries her, and he runs away after he has to tell her the truth.  There is a happy ending, as Carl helps Frank to use his abilities to catch other crooks.",1090195200,,1072,4.6

1476451,4,B00005JLSB,"More than 130 minutes for a film which has a lot of action and rhythm. Both main actors make a great performance. For Tom Hanks (Carl Hanratty) is not news, as all latest roles have been outstanding, but for Leonardo Di Caprio (Frank Abagnale, or, Frank Conners), I think this has been his best acting ever.
Besides the story (based in a real character, but full of fictionary situations) is very dynamic. Sometimes, the continuous race between the policeman and the thief seems to be somewhat ridiculous, but I think this is the spirit of the movie. To catch such a smooth criminal is really disgusting and frustrating and you need to have real perseverance to get what you want. It's like what a hacker is used to do nowadays.
Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen have got short but very important and memorable appearances. Amy Adams, who takes part as Frank's girlfriend, is on the other side, very greasy and clumsy (sorry about that).
It's not the thing you should expect from Steven Spielberg who had lost some credit after ""I.A."", but it's really recommended.",1087171200,,1066,4.767567567567568

Abagnale is told with some humor and some melodrama by Director Steven Spielberg.  DiCaprio and Hanks give very good performances in this unbelievable, but true tale.  Not one of Spielberg's best, but very entertaining.",1086998400,,374,4.707692307692308
1476453,4,B00005JLSB,"Based on the 1980 memoir by Frank Abagnale, this film follows most of the life of one of the most notorious impostors of all time. As Abagnale (played by the surprisingly amiable Leonardo DiCaprio) assumes the identities of various professionals such as an airline pilot, a lawyer, and a pediatrician, he's pursued by FBI detective Carl Hanratty (played by Tom Hanks and his ludicrously phony Boston accent).  Eventually, Abagnale is caught and, with the help of Hanratty, he sees the light and puts his gift of deceit to good use by helping the FBI crack future cases of con-artistry.
Performances are adequate, at the least. DiCaprio consistently juggles between innocence and trickery, and he is both believable in the beginning as a 16-year-old and in the end as his character endures true adulthood. Most definitely his best performance since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" Two-time Oscar-winner Hanks definitely could have done better, considering his credentials as well as his past performances. It was by no shade of the imagination bad, though, and at times one almost forgets his absurd attempt at a dialect. Christopher Walken, though, probably delivers the best performance as Abagnale's emotionally struggling father, despite his limited screen-time.
""Catch Me If You Can"" captures the candy-colored fantasy that was the '60s, but it's not free of at least some appropriately bleak moments. The film is surprisingly minimalistic with its cliches even while setting forth its good-hearted message, and director Spielberg makes the two-and-a-half hour flick breeze by like a nice, lighthearted dream.",1086566400,,1612,5.371541501976284

Catch Me If You Can is the story about a high school kid, Leonardo DiCaprio, who ran away from his disentigrating home life just to make his own life by 'acting', conning, or check bouncing his way through it.  Of course, with his check bouncing the FBI gets involved and one of their best, Tom Hanks character, has to find Leo.  Now this movie is not all about the chase, because a lot of it is about the kid's love of his family, and especially his dad, played by Christopher Walken.  I feel that all three of them were amazing in their roles, although for Leonardo most people wouldn't suspect he could be, he still was.  This is a great movie, emotional at times, funny at others, and, since it's based on a true story, it is that much better.",1084752000,,836,4.2993630573248405
1476455,4,B00005JLSB,"The trailers and the graphics used to promote ""Catch Me If You Can"" make this movie seem like a light-hearted, cartoonish chase movie, but it's much more serious than that.  Director Spielberg delves into the psychology of a real-life con artist and impersonator, teenager Frank Abagnole Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), who runs away from a broken home and must rely on his wits, albeit illegally, to keep himself afloat.  As Frank's cons get more and more bold and skilled, the FBI agent on his tail, Hanratty (Tom Hanks), scrambles to outwit him.  The two form a unique relationship of the hunter and the chased, with Frank toying with Hanratty in scene after scene. What Frank doesn't expect is to find the love of his life and a close-knit family so unlike his own that he wants to remain in their midst.
The best performances are the smaller supporting roles:  Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. and Martin Sheen as Frank Jr.'s father-in-law.  Di Caprio does a solid job with his part as a baby-faced, sweet-talking impersonator, but he rarely lets the complicated emotions surface.  Likewise, Tom Hanks is good as the agent obsessed with capturing Frank, but he doesn't add any magic to the role.  The soundtrack, with its cartoonish chase theme, helps lighten the film.
""Catch Me If You Can"" is a cross between ""The Fugitive"" and ""Matchstick Men.""  Frank's scams are often comically clever, but there is a dark underside to his story.  Its the darkness that creates the bond between Frank and the audience, as it's difficult not to feel for a young man who feels unloved and powerless.  As Frank gains confidence, he blossoms - and the audience roots for his happiness, even as we know it cannot last.",1083715200,23,1698,4.804123711340206
1476456,5,B00005JLSB,"After two science-fiction films (A.I and Minority Report) which where not exempt from reproaches but also very attractive, Steven Spielberg stays into the realm of entertainment. But, the reproaches that could be made to his precedent movies, the extravagance and the Hollywood tendency from these projects, are no longer there. With `Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg. He tends to be just like a young director whose exploring new approaches, but with a lot of experience: the cast is perfect, the cinematographer is very good and the well trained compositor (John Williams) has the intelligence of producing new themes.
Where Spielberg hit the point is in his total mastering of the Abagnale / Hanratty pursuit which, instead of being made in an epileptic manner, works more on the psychological level of the relationship. This pursuit shows the research of a missing father by a missed child who has no other way to prove his existence than to play with the law. Di Caprio shows, once again, his abilities to act the different facets of the tormented teenager, even if for an actor who is almost in his thirties it's maybe the time to change. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks, he has nothing to prove.
Intelligent, slick and quick witted, `Catch Me...' is fun and entertaining and tells the story of a young man ingeniously tricking people, leaving you sympathising with him to the very end.",1083542400,,1417,4.859504132231405
1476457,2,B00005JLSB,"I read the book ""Catch Me If You Can"" by Frank Abagnale at least 20 years ago and found it one of the most entertaining books I've ever read, all about the fascinating exploits of a teenage con man who managed to pass himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, an attorney, while managing to steal millions of dollars by forging checks.  So when I heard that no less than Stephen Spielberg was going to make a movie out of it, I was really looking forward to seeing it.
Big disappointment.  First, there is the problem with the miscasting of the main character.  In his book, Frank Abagnale specifically states that one of the reason that people were willing to accept a teenager as an authority figure like a pilot or an attorney was being he was unusually large and tall for his age.  This is not a description of Leonardo DiCaprio, a little pixie, who must be at least in his late 20s now, but could still pass for a high school freshman.  If Leo tried to make somebody think he was any kind of a professional person, the only logical response would from them be to say, ""Aren't you going to say 'Trick of Treat?'""
Second, this book cried out to be filmed as a gay romp, showing us the great life Frank gained with his lies and stolen money, until that point when the forces of the law inevitably caught up with him and he was severely punished.  In the book, Frank never indicates that he felt at all ambivalent about what he was doing until he was arrested.
Not so in the movie, where we are presented with a portrayal of Frank as a tortured soul bearing the great psychological burden of having parents who got divorced (along with half the other kids in the US) which drove him to commit these crimes.  (By the way, the book never portrayed his father as a con man either, so the like father, like son dynamic depicted on screen is another complete fabrication.)  Why does someone lie and steal?  Duh!  To get the nice things in life without having to work for them, idiot.
In short, this movie is a massive missfire.  Too bad, it could have been something special.

He is very compelling as Frank Abignale Jr, and Tom Hanks makes a good appearance (but not very memorable) as a secret agent who tracks down Leonardo eventually and has him arrested.

However, this movie quickly takes you in and I was unable to turn away. I was shocked that someone Frank's age could do all of the things he'd done. Let alone not get caught for so long.
Brenda upset me, but you could tell that she was weak from the beginning. She needed someone to tell her what to do. I wasn't surprised when she arrived at the airport and all the FBI agents were there.

The end does have a ""happy"" ending. Frank does go to prison, but Tom Hanks character gets him out early, as long as he'll work for the FBI in the fraud department until his sentence is up.

1476561,4,B00005JLSB,"After a couple of heavyweight superdramas in the 90's (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), Steven Spielberg gives us this real life portrait of Frank Abegnale, Jr, a young man from a broken home who managed to elude the FBI for years and write millions of dollars in bogus checks.  The real Frank Abegnale was on hand as a consultant to make sure events were accurate.
Interesting how this movie is done.  Spielberg starts out by showing us Frank in a prison in France, obviously caught for something.  We learn what that is very quickly, but we know from the start that Frank's journey will eventually leave him behind bars.  From there we see him as a young man being raised by his parents in New York, and we see where he gets the ability to impersonate.  After a school bully runs him into some lockers, he walks into a French class and seeing no teacher there, he begins instructing the class.  It just so happens that the bully is also part of the class.
He's busted for that, and his father (Christopher Walken) is almost proud of his son's ability to lie.  Just wait.  From there, Frank becomes a pilot, lawyer, doctor, all with no experience, just an ability to fake ID badges and sweet talk people.  All the time, he is being chased by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) the agent who eventually gets him.
So, does the story end there?  Not really.  The last act is an interesting one and ties the film up nicely.  This film is a bit overlong, but not dull at all, and will make you feel good in the end.

I am not a fan of Leo, but I do quite enjoy Chris Walken, I think he is great in this role.  However the movie tends to be a slow plodding homage to the era when the events take place.  The story of how a 18 year old kid turned into the one of the greatest non violent con men in American history seems to take a backseat to Steven Spielberg's infatuation with the era.  What is missing is the breezy carefree attitude that Mr. Abagnale expressed so easily in the book.  The film tries to hard to be moralistic.  I guess I was just expecting more when such a talented group of film makers and actors too on a great book like this.
About the DVD:  I got this DVD for my birthday and watched disc one almost immediately, and was left disappointed, it took a few months for me to dig this out and take a look at disc two. It is loaded and is imminently more interesting than the film.  There are 5 vignettes on the supplemental disc that are all worth your time. Especially the retrospective on the real Frank Abagnale.

1476664,4,B00005JLSB,"This is a generally entertaining film with lesser ambitions than comparable films such as The Great Impostor (1961) and -- at least to some extent --  Zelig (1983) and Chamelon Street (1989). Directed by Steven Spielberg, Catch Me If You Can is mostly based on the autobiography of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., played by Leonardo DiCaprio. His performance is adequate but overshadowed by those of Christopher Walken (as Frank Sr.) and Tom Hanks (as Carl Hanratty, a character created by Spielberg and Jeff Nathanson who wrote the screenplay). Given Frank Jr.'s charm which seems natural to DiCaprio, it is easy to understand how quickly he could deceive so many different people, both in the United States and abroad. More difficult for me to understand is how Frank Jr. -- as portrayed by DiCaprio -- could sustain that deception almost indefinitely.
I just wish the film had devoted more attention to the exceptional cunning which was obviously required of Frank Jr. to devise so many ingenious strategies and tactics. For example, he recognized the benefits of having others' bank deposits credited to his own account so he devised a way by which to print slips bearing his account number. He then replaced blank deposit slips in bank branches with his own deposit slips. I also wish more attention had been devoted to examining Frank Jr.'s compulsive need to assume others' identities. Deep down, was he ashamed of his father? Was he ashamed of himself? I am also curious to know how he could betray the confidence of so many decent people and still remain so cheerful, even playful, even after he was finally apprehended. Perhaps Spielberg should be blamed for casting DiCaprio or perhaps the two of them should be blamed for a poorly developed character. In fact, other than Frank Sr. and perhaps Hanratty, none of the characters in this film is sufficiently developed. Hence the Four Star rating which includes one for the Walken and Hanks performances and another for the special features.
To repeat, Catch Me If You Can is frequently entertaining. However, after seeing it again recently, I again wondered if the real Frank Jr. could gain my confidence as easily as he did others. Probably...but DiCaprio's Frank Jr. couldn't.",1075161600,,2230,4.978552278820375

DiCaprio does an adequate job as the precocious criminal, but simply doesn't possess the cunning or bluster to be a credible high-stakes con man.  Tom Hanks gives (for once) a highly inconsistent performance, one minute confused and discombobulated and the next minute cool and calculating.  Christopher Walken tries hard as DiCaprio's hard-luck father, but is too chilly to evoke the sympathy Spielberg apparently wants us to have for him.  Second problem: direction.

1476755,4,B00005JLSB,"It is very hard for a director to make a truly great film today but it is even harder for a director to make two great films in one year. One director who is trying to do this is already known to be one of the greats: Steven Spielberg. Spielberg, who in years past brought us such classics as Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E.T., earlier this year directed the critically praised Minority Report. Unfortunately the film seemed to gather more media attention over the box office battle it had with Disney's Lilo & Stitch more then anything else. Now after directing box office draw Tom Cruise, Mr. Spielberg hopes to breathe new box office life into the ailing career of Leonardo DiCaprio by having star opposite Oscar winning actor, Tom Hanks. Will the experiment work and show that Spielberg still has the directing spark he had many years ago or will this be one of the few flaws in his career?
The film follows the amazing and emotionally driven life of Frank Abagnale Jr. from his late childhood to the present day. At the beginning of the film, Frank Abagnale Jr. lives a normal life with his parents in a beautiful home but things quickly change. When his father runs into trouble with the IRS, the family is forced to move into a small apartment. This leads to Frank's mother cheating on her husband and eventually his parents divorce. Frank, alone and confused, can't handle this anymore and runs away from home. But things begin to look up as Abagnale makes a decent living for himself by disguising himself as an airline pilot and thus being declared the James Bond of the skies. Unfortunately Frank can't keep the job for long as his must keep moving so that a FBI agent named Carl Hanratty can't catch him. Hanratty is a very serious and determined man who will do anything just to place the cuffs on this little criminal mastermind. The plot for Catch Me If You Can, which is based on a true story, was very well done though it felt weighted in moments. There were several sequences that probably weren't necessary for the feature while the ending came off as being too long and flat compared to the rest of the film.
All characters in the film were based on real life people and the cast does a magnificent job of presenting a delightful true life film. It wasn't much of a stretch for Leonardo DiCaprio, who takes the lead role as Frank Abagnale Jr., to play the ladies man but it has been quite some time since he played such a young character as the one he plays here. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a confused, lonely young man who continues the chase with Agent Hanratty not because he loves it but that he needs it. He needs the cat and mouse game with Agent Hanratty as well as the conversations he has with over the phone on Christmas to fill the void he is missing with his family. Quite surprisingly DiCaprio pulls off being a young character and shows great acting ability expressing this character. Agent Hanratty may not be an Oscar winning performance for Tom Hanks but does seem to be a role that he has a lot of fun with. Christopher Walken is fabulous as Frank Abagnale Sr. and really plays off Leonardo DiCaprio in the conversations the two characters have together. It is a shame that his character us not given as good of a send off as he should have had but it is not such a big deal. And Jennifer Garner, as gifted an actress as she may be, seems pointless in this film as her character doesn't really do anything overall for the feature.
Overall, Catch Me If You Can is another good offering from the creative directing genius of Steven Spielberg but certainly isn't one of his greatest and not even close to the creativity of Minority Report earlier this year. The film is certainly a great diversion from the usual dramatic fares but Catch Me seems too slow and flat in portions of the feature. Besides those squabbles, everything else seems to click especially from the cast with the exception of Jennifer Garner's character, which has more to do with her character not really doing anything and not her acting ability. Catch Me If You Can is a nice film, though, for people to relax in without having to waste a very long time with or being too blown away with elaborate special effects. Catch this film, if you can.

""Catch Me If You Can"" brings that all back in a rush, and also features the welcome sight of Tom Hanks stretching himself beyond the warm, lovable characters he's most associated with, portraying a character more prickly and difficult to warm to than any since his starring role in ""Saving Private Ryan.""
Spielberg's film moves along at a brisk pace, feeling very much of the period that it portrays, while reflecting a modern audience's sensibilities. When it needs to move quickly, it does, but he's also not afraid to let the camera linger on his two actors, allowing them to convey without words the deeper painful waters that run beneath their surfaces.
Towards the end, the film threatens to wear out its welcome, but on the whole, it ends up being a rewarding experience that is genuinely good for the whole family: Younger viewers will enjoy the caper aspects of the film (although it's no ""Sting"" or ""The Great Train Robbery,"" nor does it try to be), while older viewers will enjoy the subtexts of a desire to find a role in the world, and a way to make a mark.

They take an intriguing premise, a 16 year old runs away from home after his parents seperate and becomes one of the most notorious check forgers in U.S. history, and turns it into a very watchable film.  Spielberg wisely keeps the pace breezy and avoids some of the darker aspects of Frank's life (although it is hinted at in several powerful scenes between DiCaprio and Walken, especially the one set in a New York bar), setting the tone for an extremely entertaining ""coming-of-age"" movie from the swingin' 60's.  It's a great story told with vibrant actors, colors, wardrobe etc. that bring to life the era in which they took place.  The only downside of the film is that the ending is very disjointed from the overall pacing of the film.  Its like your cruising along the highway at a pretty good clip and someone neutral drops your car.  Although the ending turns out to have great redemptive value for the character and I was glad when Abignale finally turned himself around, Spielberg could've had a more direct way of coming to that conclusion that is more in-line with the overall tone of the picture.

1476931,4,B00005JLSB,"This movie purports to be about an actual person, Frank Abagnale, Jr., who posed more or less successfully as an airline pilot, teacher, physician, lawyer, and Secret Service agent (not in that order) before he turned 21.

It begins in a television studio, with three people all claiming to be the real Frank Abagnale, leaving the audience to judge who the real one is, but never returns to that sequence, and doesn't finish it.

I remember seeing just such a TV show years ago, which showed just such an imposter, but whose name I've forgotten.  I remember that he posed as a surgeon in the Canadian Navy, where he actually removed an apprendix successfully, and as a professor at St. Martin's college outside Olympia, Washington.

I don't remember all of the other details or parts he played, but I suspect that he was the trigger character for this movie.  If so, this was highly fictionalized, although the original story was supposedly written by Abagnale himself (the real con man).

Steven Spielberg produced and directed Catch Me If You Can, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing a 17-year-old as the lead whose mother and father are splitting up, and eventually divorce.  The mother is cheating on his father, depicted as a romantic loser by Martin Sheen.  The FBI agent that is tailing Abagnale is very well portrayed by Tom Hanks.  DiCaprio, Sheen, and Hanks all turn in good peformances.

The impostor that I saw on the TV show I later heard dropped out of sight, and apparently went back to his old tricks.  In the movie, Abagnale was sentenced to do 12 years in federal prison for bouncing a couple of million bucks worth of bad checks, but then was hired by the FBI to help them catch other ""paper hangers.""

The denouement stated that Abagnale eventually was married, had children, and was living ""happily ever after.""

It sounds too much like the character I saw on TV to be coincidental, but that guy was not a 17-year-old. More like in his forties, and not all that good-looking. Maybe Abagnale was a ""copy cat.""

As another reviewer has said, Spielberg does not sufficiently delve into to details of how Abagnale pulled off his impersonations (it all looks far too easy), nor his motivation.

All in all, it was an entertaining film.

1476933,5,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me If You Can is based on the true life story of one of the most successful con artists in history - Frank Abagnale Jr. ( Leonardo Dicaprio). Frank is able to assume several different identities including a Secret Service agent, an airline pilot, a doctor, and a history professor to cash more than $2.5 million in fraudulent checks in the United States, as well as 26 other countries.  Carl Hanratty ( Tom Hanks) is the lead FBI agent in the Checks Fraud division that is tracking Abagnale, and is determined to take him down no matter what. ""Catch Me If You Can"" takes us on an exciting and extremely entertaining cat and mouse chase between the two men.
""Catch Me If You Can"" is without a doubt the best film I have seen in the last couple of years. The film's screenplay was an extremely accurate adaptation of the book that was written by Frank himself. The story was absolutely perfect to bring to the big screen, simply because of how successfull Frank was. He managed to accomplish everything before he was 19. The overall direction from Stephen Spielberg was amazing. The film is paced extremely well, and even though it is almost 2 1/2 hours running, the film never seems long or drawn out. The set designs were also extremely authentic, and Spielberg was able to get the best performances possible out of the actors.
The overall cast was just great in this movie. Each actor was the perfect choice for their particular role. I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. But I must admit, that he turned in an outstanding performance and captured the true essance of Frank Abignale Jr. He is cunning, intelligent, and witty. This let him play the different identities of lawyer, teacher, doctor, etc, so convincingly. Tom Hanks was brilliant as Carl Hanratty. He will amaze you with the determination he gives in tracking Abignale. Hanks will also make you laugh because of his Boston accent, and also because of how extremely naive he can be at times. At one point, Abignale is able to convince Carl that he is a Secret Service agent working on the case. Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Jennifer Gardner ( TV's ""Alias""), and the rest of the cast put in top notch performances as well. Finally, the film is extremely fun to watch and down right hillarious. I was laughing for the majority of the film, and I actually had a good time watching Frank from one moment to the next.
""Catch Me If You Can"" was easily the best film of 2002.

1476934,5,B00005JLSB,"It was my father's idea to watch this movie;he said that a movie with Tom Hanks and Spielberg and Leonardo all together can't be that bad,so I agreed. But as it turned out,it isn't just ""not bad"",but thrilling,moving and most unique.
The movie is adapted from a real story. 16-year-old Frank W.Abgnate Jr. has a liar father and a Russian mother. He has the same(if not better)cheating talent and skills as his father,that allows him to fake the filling-in French teacher in his new school for a whole week without being known. When his mother divorces his father and he is asked to sign to decide which parent to live with,he breaks and ran away from home.
From that moment his adventure begins. Frank decides that the best way to gain money is faking checks. And he cheats numerous banks and gets millions of money. To get more fun,using his talent he becomes a pilot,a doctor,a lawyer - and even finds a girl he seriously wants to marry with. All the while,An FBI agnet,Carl Hanratty(Tome Hanks),is chasing him,determined to get him.
The story alone is bewildering enough. But Leonardo is even more amazing. I never like Leonardo before,neitherdid my dad(he stopped wanting to break Leon's neck only after he'd seen him drawn in Titanic).But here Leonardo's really like a talented young man. He is 28 already and he still plays the teenager like real. It's not a bit exaggerating to say that every glance,every move is impeccable. He is Frank Abgnate Jr.,and Frank is him. And you really should see how he deals with Carl had cornered him in the hotel room! It's only just unbelievable.
Of course,honestly I don't think that Tom has played his best,and I believe the movie can do with a better name.

The 2.5 hours are rather long, but Spielberg does a good job at keeping the story moving at a manageable pace.  There are some scenes that are totally unnecessary, and Martin Sheen puts up some pathetic performance.  But DiCaprio is surprisingly excellent and convincing as the protagonist, and Walken, one of my favorite actors of all time, turns in admirable performance as the down-and-out father.  Hanks is ok; a bit too much acting on his part.  DiCaprio alone is worth seeing the movie for.

1476936,4,B00005JLSB,"Frank Abignale is a con artist without really trying to be.  Fleeing from his parents' divorce at the age of 16, he observes how much respect a Pan Am pilot gets from a hotel concierge and the young ladies.  He therefore gets his hands on a uniform, passes off a few bad cheques, and is on his way to fame, fortune, girls, and free air travel.
That's about all there is to this immensely enjoyable, funny, and lighthearted film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the con artist, Christopher Walken as his father, and Tom Hanks as an FBI agent trying to track him down.  The performances are all excellent, as you might expect from the cast.  John William's score is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but its ""jazz fusion"" feel sets the perfect tone for Abignale's ad lib life of deception.
Some have complained that the characters are a little shallow and the adventure superficial - this is unfair, as the movie doesn't mean to be anything but a light-hearted romp.  It is unfairly overlooked, I think, because of the principle filmmakers' other projects that were released the same year: Spielberg's controversial A.I. and critical and commercial hit Minority Report, DiCaprio's multi-Oscar nominated Gangs of New York, and Hanks' multi-Oscar nominated Road to Perdition.  However, for pure enjoyment, this film beats all the above hands-down.

Spielberg's directing is superb, making the film a very realistic one indeed; there's an extremely entertaining script by Jeff Nathanson; then there's a very fine score by John Williams.

Plus the way he acted in public turned me off even more.  One thing I can't stand is spoiled brat celebrities.  The ONLY reasons I wanted to see this was for Tom Hanks (I've been a fan of him since Bosom Buddies), and the story itself intrigued me.  What I realized as I was watching this, is that Leo seems to have grown up, and that he can act again!!!  As for the movie itself, it's wonderful.  It's funny, but you don't get the sense that they are glorifying Mr. Abagnale's life of crime either, which is good.

1477005,5,B00005JLSB,"Everything about Steven Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a joy.  From the terrificly-retro John Williams musical score, to the fine acting performances, to the vibrant colors that saturate every scene in the film, to the clever animated title sequence, right on through to the enormously fine-tuned 1960s period detail that we see throughout the movie.

The sets and the colors used in this film truly make you feel you're back in the mid-1960s.  I only caught one very small error in this ""period"" flavoring of the movie, and that is a short clip shown of a Boeing 767 jetliner landing. The 767 didn't first fly until 1981.  Everything else lands the viewer directly in the middle of the '60s.

The story of one of the granddaddies of all check-forgers, Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., is told here by Mr. Spielberg at a very brisk and viewer-friendly pace; and, even though the picture clocks in at a fairly-lengthy 2 hours and 21 minutes, it never becomes tedious or wears out its welcome.  It seems fresh at every turn.

A marvelous film with brilliant attention to period detail, and a first-rate DVD to boot!  The 2-Disc DVD features multiple featurettes on the making of the film, with an ample dose of information provided by Mr. Spielberg himself.

I love the ""look"" and the feel of this film, and the way Director Spielberg uses his camera to tell the story...such as utilizing a high overhead shot looking down on a crowded street teeming with people, one of which is our subject, Mr. Abagnale, who stands out significantly by his merely donning his newly-acquired bright white Pan Am pilot's cap. ... There's another scene where Spielberg chooses to frame his actor (Tom Hanks) in the upper right corner of the screen, shooting him while we gaze over the shoulder of another actor in the foreground. ... And another grandiose Spielberg-like moment comes in the corridor of a fancy hotel, where nothing but the turning of a shoe tells the desire of a would-be femme fatale.

And the video transfer to disc is eye-popping!  The colors are very bold and lifelike. Just perfect.

This DVD offers three different Main Menus, based on each of the three primary ""fake occupations"" that Mr. Abagnale engages in.

1477008,5,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me If You Can (2002), dir. Steven Spielberg
With: Leonardo DiCaprio,  Tom Hanks.
Spielberg, aided by the talents of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, made an entertaining two-hour plus movie that, despite a slightly moralistic twist, is, in his words, pure unadulterated fun.  Catch Me If You Can must not be seen as a serious movie, but it does make a few ironic points,  if you are not too entertained to notice them. Its a cat-and-mouse structure,  comedic tone, movie, with light moments, a few (too few, given the subject) serious ones, with suspense galoreand Spielberg is just as much of a master of suspense as the old master (Hitchcock), whom Spielberg often imitates.
Comedy, satire, the American ethos: an unhappy youngster, a mom who flirts, a semi-drunk dad, and a young man who goes astray; he is smart, ingenious and discovers early that the easiest way to make money is to dupe people. So he pretends to be a school teacher, a pilot in PANAM, a phony doctor, and even a lawyer. He forges checks with uncanny ability, showing how easy it is to cash a phony check if you are charming and convincing. In tight situations, he uses ready witreminding us of his prototype, Huck Finn (who extricated himself from tight situations by lying readily). Of course, he has his way with women, for Abagnale (a real person) is somewhat of a Don Juan, though not for amorous reasons. This man wants to deceive for the sake for deceiving. He makes money, but rarely uses it. He is out there for the thrills, and also because he is essentially a loner, though the movie never gives him sufficient pause to introspect. He always hurries, between tight situations Thus the quick pacing, which keeps us entertained, if nothing else.
This actually is the point of the entire movie. We do not have much time to think. The young conman is constantly in peril, and manages to slip away just by the breadth of a hair. Tom Hanks is somewhat heavy-handed at first, slow to catch up with the youngsters quicker wit. But sooner than later he gets the pointand closes in. He tells him (the two are on the phone several times), its like Las Vegas: you win a few, but in the end its the house that wins. And Hanks, in fact, is good in this, almost a supporting role. He is a surrogate father, and, if the movie makes a moral point, he does fulfill that role.
Though based on real life, and real life-events, this movie barely escapes being a shallow escapade. If it has a moral, it is a surface one: those out there be aware of imposters. Its incredibly easy to cash false checks; charming young people are not what they appear. If you are a woman, be extra careful next time you see someone resembling Leo DiCaprio, or anyone like him. If you are an FBI agent, don't be so clumsy with your first attempts to catch a crook. If you are an ordinary American, look around you for phoniesthey can be anywhere, including inside your family.
This is the stuff Hollywood makes, and, if anything, Spielberg is first and foremost a Hollywood manand a good salesman of his products to boot (DreamWorks). Never mind pretensions of art in his movies. This is not the guy/director who will make an art movie, even if his wildest dreams came true. That task is for the likes of John Sayles (have you seen Sunshine State?) or Martin Scorsese, who will venture into the wilderness of art movie making with Travis Bickle or Jesus (or Nicholas Cage)all this to satisfy his mania for discovering true people in true places. Spielberg plays the big game: he wants a guaranteed success in his screens versions of truth.
To be fair, the movie does take some pains to explore the depths of naivet people will fall into, or the lengths to which they go to be deceived. Its like a national affliction: we Americans like to be conned, whether its the money thats taken from us by corporate wizards (witness ENRON), by taxes (never mind Bushs tax cuts), funeral parlors, drug industries (legal or illegal), or charming youths. Do you want to be an air pilot? Just wear the uniform and come to the job with an assured smile. Do you want to get your PH.D. in 24 hours? Just look at your unsolicited e-mail. Thats how easy and painless it is.
From that standpoint the movie wins. It warns the wise and cautions the nave. It gives a lesson to the dispirited and the despairing, teaching that anything is possibleincluding forging non-existing checks. Win a million the easy way. It teaches the bad ways of the American way. If you are a thief once, don't give up. The FBI will shelter you and offer you a job (and get you out of jail) if you can help catch more thieves. You are in the right country, where winning is the name of the game. In a deliciously twisted ironic comment, Tom Hanks warns the young escapee that if he wants to blow his secure job for a cheap thrill of escaping once again, he has fifty years/time waiting for him; a warning to the wise (and unwise), for Caprio/Abagnale for once goes where common sense beckons: to a bright future, catching more thieves, and, more importantly, inventing security devices for banks. That has netted him millions. A true story for the millions.",1060473600,2,5158,4.572972972972973

That being said, all the girls that like him in this movie is pretty believable. I mean especially when he is pretending to have cool jobs. Girls love that as well. My friend isn't even done with med school and he has girls all over him, and they are hot. So my point here is, is that girls love guys who are good looking and have cool jobs, and that is what Dicaprio is in this movie.
I am a big fan of it, It suprised me how entertaining it was. It was kind of a ""Nonstop romp of fun and mischeif, coupled with some heartfelt moments.""",1060214400,,653,3.9545454545454546

This movie was such a delight to watch it easily sets the standard for movies that are inspired by true stories.  The cat and mouse chase that Tom Hanks and Leonardo  DiCaprio go through throughout this movie is so engrossing that you almost never want it to end.  To think that this young man, Frank Abagnale, Jr.  played by DiCaprio, actually successfully passed himself off as a pilot, doctor and lawyer all before he turned 21 is so amazing and well worthy of being made into a movie you find yourself in awe of him and his quick witted charm.  Steven Spielberg does a great job of putting this story onto the screen and making it so unbelievably  entertaining and easy to watch that it almost seems effortless for him.  Not to be forgotten is the touching performance turned in by Christopher Walken, who plays the father of Frank and who earned an Academy Award Nomination for his job well done.  If I had to describe this movie with one word it would be fun.  You have so much fun watching this movie that it really does feel like your watching a true story and not some hollywood created generic  filth.

Leonardo Di Caprio is just not a good actor.  No matter what role he plays, he's like a little kid showing off.  I just couldn't get engaged with his character or really care.

As directed by Steven Spielberg, CMIYC is a very entertaining film.  It's well paced, funny, and moving at times.
My one complaint about the DVD is that Janusz Kaminski's cinematography gets mucked up in the transfer to digital.  On my widescreen digital TV and proscan DVD player, there are some digital problems in low light scenes with streams of light in the background.

1477107,4,B00005JLSB,"A Film by Steven Spielberg
Catch Me If You Can is based on the 1980 memoir by Frank Abagnale.  We are told at the very beginning that this movie is inspired by the book, which means that there are changes in both the events of the book as well as the characters.  All this means is that the filmmakers chose to tell a slightly different story than was Abagnale presented in the book.  It doesn't make the movie any less truthful.
This is the story of con man Frank Abagnale, Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio).  The movie starts with Abagnale in a French prison and being released into the custody of FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  Throughout the film we switch back between Abagnale conning and running from the law to Abagnale and Hanratty talking on the plane.  It offers a nice change of pace as well as a continued questioning of how Abagnale got caught.
We flash back to Abagnale before he leaves home.  He is devoted to his father (Christopher Walken), and is deeply hurt by the divorce and the court requirement that he make the choice of which parent he wants to live with.  Instead, Abagnale chooses neither and runs away to New York City.  Thus begins his life of the con (though there is a suggestion that he had been doing some check/credit card conning before he runs away).  Surprisingly, the movie strays from focusing on Frank Abagnale himself but spends just as much (or more) time on Carl Hanratty and the hunt to catch Abagnale.
Hanratty is a somewhat geeky FBI Agent.  He is very serious and very devoted to his job of catching check frauds like Abagnale.  He is good at his job, but Abagnale leads Hanratty on a long chase over most of the country (and the world) before ending in France.  The film shows as Hanratty discovers more clues as to where Abagnale is, but never quite manages to catch up to him.  There is the yearly Christmas Eve phone call from Abagnale to Hanratty (because both end up alone on Christmas).
We do get to see some of the cons that Frank Abagnale pulls off, but we never quite see his preparation or learn the reason why Abagnale is conning.  It takes something away from an otherwise excellent movie.
I would recommend this movie as I thought it was quite good, but if I had to choose between Abagnale's book and the movie, I would take the book any day of the week.",1058832000,,2312,4.458432304038005

The family goes to live in an apartment in a poor neighborhood. Frank changes school and when he arrives at his new school, he passes himself as the teacher. Then his mother, who is having an affair with a friend of her husband, decides to divorce. The lawyer ask Frank to choose if he is going to live with his mother or his father. He decides to run away with his check book that his father gave to him for his 16th birthday. When he gots nothing left in his account, he starts giving bad checks. Then, he sees a pilot on the street and it gives him the idea to become a pilot. He starts by going to Panam and pretend to be a kid making a report for his school paper. He gets information on how to become a pilot and the identification he needs. Then, he calls to the company and says that he lost his suit on the plane and asks where he can get another one. He gets his suit and the guy only ask him for his Pilot number, so he gots the suit and he starts cashing checks around the USA in different banks.  Meanwhile, F.B.I. Investigator Carl Henratty is on the trail of Frank, so Frank changes his name and profession, He meets a girl he likes and ask her to marry him, she accepts and he becomes a lawyer working for her father. But, he made a mistake because he can no longer change his name if he is married, because she would not stay married to a crook. So, Frank goes to Europe and spends a couple of years there before being caught around Christmas of 1967. Then, he goes to jail in France for 2 years and goes back to the United States around Christmas of 1969. He is sentenced to 12 years in jail and stays friend with Carl Henratty who while visiting Frank in 1970, discovers that Frank could work for the F.B.I. Finally, in 1974, Carl convinces the F.B.I. to release Frank from jail and make him work for the governement for the rest of his sentence. Since then, Frank has been paid millions of dollars from the governement for having captured some the best crooks in the world and he designed some checks for banks around the world.

Based on a true story (and from what I hear, quite accurate), this film follows the life of a very young Frank Abagnale jr. who runs away from home and disguises himself as a pilot, then a doctor, then a lawyer, all in the course of two years. The FBI is following him, particularly Carl Handratty, who works in the fraud department and doesn't have much for a sense of humor. This film strays from the usual ""based on a true story"" inspirational dreck and instead creates a fun, fast pace. The film runs close to two and a half hours, but feels like a mere 70 minutes. DiCaprio is perfect as young Abagnale, Hanks is (as always) marvelous as Handratty, but the best performance in the film comes from Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. Walken owns every scene he's in. He's absolutely brilliant. ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a very different film for Spielberg, but he shows once again that in the movie business, he's the very best.",1058400000,,996,4.538888888888889
1477169,3,B00005JLSB,"This movie is not a standard ""cop catches a thief"" story.  I don't think Steven Spielberg wants us to dislike or hate the thief and that, we want justice to be done towards the end by having the cop getting the culprit.  Rather, he shares with us Leonardo's character's family background, about his parent's divorce, about a young innocent boy that is forced to grow up too fast to fend for himself.  All along, Leonardo's character has a affectionate relationships with his father (played convincingly by the ever brilliant Christopher Walken) & there is a tell-tale sign in the movie that his X-factor is passed on by his father.  Maybe, Leonardo's character enjoys acting different characters so that he can escape from reality & that, he wants to make a lot of money to justify to his parents that they don't need to worry about financial security anymore & that they needn't have to worry about the very thing that separates them at the first place.  That's why in the end, all we have for Leonardo's character is utmost sympathy.  Sympathy is what Tom Hank's character gives Leonardo's character & maybe, that's why they share this chemistry or bond that can be read in between the lines.  It's refreshing to see Martin Sheen NOT playing US President for a change.  A truly enjoyable movie to watch & an affirmation of Steven Spielberg's versatility in directing different genres of movies.  Highly recommended & shouldn't be missed!",1058313600,,1439,4.840816326530613
1477170,4,B00005JLSB,The storyline- although based on a true story (so sorry no originality points) is great. Such a clever idea for a movie and so fun to watch the cat and mouse game between Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio. Leo does such a great job- I still am not sure why he isn't an Oscat winner... and the movie does not have a dull moment.,1057968000,,320,4.015625
1477171,5,B00005JLSB,"The storyline seems highly implausible on the surface; a seventeen-year-old boy runs away from home and impersonates an airline pilot, a pediatrician, and a district attorney - and is chased by the FBI for passing millions of dollars in bad checks.  And why cast Leonardo DiCaprio, a pretty face, in the lead role if you want this film to be believable?
But the movie, `Catch Me If You Can,' works surprisingly well; and not just because Leonardo uses his disguise to obtain sex from unsuspecting stewardesses; and not just because he cons a high-priced hooker into giving him a night's worth of pleasure - in exchange for an over-the-amount cashier's check - in which he even makes a profit on the deal!
No, this feature is remarkably heart-warming because Leonardo (as Frank Abagnale Jr., a real person) is motivated, despite his sophistication, by a young boy's desire to help his father financially - in the secret hope that he might somehow bring his parents back together.
Christopher Walken plays an outstanding role as Frank Abagnale Sr., Leonardo's father in the film.  The relationship they share is special; and Walken presents the elder Abagnale with extreme dignity, even as his life spirals irreversibly downhill.
Tom Hanks (as Inspector Hanratty) is the nerdish FBI agent who obsesses over catching Leonardo, and eventually does.  But the movie reaches a seemingly poignant conclusion when Leonardo discovers, after he is apprehended, that his father has died without ever regaining his stature; and that his mother has remarried (and has had another child) - forever dashing his dreams of recapturing they joy they once shared together as a family.  Frank's life then encounters a fortuitous twist - which leads to a surprisingly happy conclusion!
If you've ever loved your dad, or suffered through your own parent's break up, I'm sure you'll find this film to be exceptionally moving.  The outrageous cons are actually just for kicks.  This is easily the best Leonardo DiCaprio or Christopher Walken movie I've ever enjoyed, and I recommend it very highly!",1057881600,3,2073,5.08235294117647

By rights Spielberg should have us on the edge of our seats, and though it's enjoyable enough I can't help but feel it had the potential to be greater.",1057795200,4,433,4.425

1477177,2,B00005JLSB,"I guess I must have viewed a different version of ""Catch Me If You Can"" than did many of the other previous reviewers. So their will be a number of readers who won't like what I going to say, but every man has a right to his opinion, so here goes.
Based on a true story, ""Catch Me..."" is the tale of con-man, Frank Abignale, Jr. who over a 5-6 year period posed as a pilot, doctor and deputy prosecutor as he bilked over $4 million dollars in ""salary"" from Pan Am, a medical hospital and the city of New Orleans.  Frank's story is basically a sad one that Director Steven Spielberg portrays accurately.  So accurately in fact, that the movie is rather depressing to watch.  The son of a con-man, young Frank learned the ways of his father quite well and spent a number of years just trying to get his father's approval and his parents back together.
FBI agent Hanratty (Hanks) spends the entire movie on the trail of young Frank coming oh-so-close, but almost always finding himself one step behind.  Speilberg seems to takes considerable poetic license in portraying both Hanks and the FBI as modern day Keystone Kops who never quite get the job done!  I can't imagine that the real FBI bungled the chase as much as Speilberg portrayed.
It's hard to believe that this movie was just a ""mudder"" with the outstanding cast that it had. (But then again, look at the cast of ""Nothing But Trouble"" and explain to me why that ensemble allowed themselves to be associated with THAT celluloid dog!!)You just can't get much better than Tom Hanks, Chris Walken and Martin Sheen and each of them seemed to be oddly out of place in this film.  Leonardo Dicaprio does a credible job as young Frank, but even he seems stunted somewhat by Speilberg's heavy-handed direction.
Well...maybe I am a little hard on the film, but I did go into it with very high expectations.  So rather than completely ignore it, the viewer should probably pony up the cash to rent it (I wouldn't buy it) and make his or her own qualified judgement.  But after you view the first 45 minutes or so, you too might be urged to change the title to ""Turn Me Off If You Can"".

1477255,4,B00005JLSB,"When I watched this movie on the flight from Pearl Harbor to Guam, I was shocked at how they could still take a movie with almost no special effects and a relatively (at least it seemed like it) low budget and make a damn good movie based on an intriguing but questionable decision for a feature film.
Christopher Walken makes almost every movie he's in better and Tom Hanks is one of the best actors of all-time.  DiCaprio, who has been in some stupid movies and I believe is a level below Walken and about three below Hanks, is at least convincing enough as Frank Abagnale Jr.  This was one of his (if not the) strongest performances and he did not lessen the quality of this movie.
The ending is uplifting, as it really goes into a downward spiral that is quite depressing, and it really made me feel good that this young man (Abagnale Jr.) found something positive to put his strengths towards.  I don't want to ruin what happens for those of you who have not seen this, but you'll like it.",1056672000,,994,4.391304347826087
1477256,2,B00005JLSB,"Steven Speilberg once again drafts Hollywood's A-list to play out his latest overlong, self- indulgant blockbuster.  The reviews of this film drew me in, I must admit.  It was apparently the most fun I was going to have watching a movie this year.  Well who could turn that down???  Plus,  the plot of a high energy cat and mouse featuring the usually brilliant and entertaining Tom Hanks really appealed to me.  So, my expectations were high.  Nevertheless about an hour into the film I really began to wonder if I was watching the same film that had won over the critics and received numorous words of praise.  It was dark, gloomy, and full of grey skies and sadness.  I won't go into spoilers, though, this was my general impression of the film thus far.  Another hour later, I was sorely disappointed.  I literally could not wait for the movie to end so I could go to sleep.  Chances are, if you came to this movie looking for any sort of excitement or action, you'll be catching some z's as well.
Specifically, ""Catch me If you Can"" moves at a snails pace.  The chase sequences are so few and far between that you never have that intense feeling of excitement or danger for the characters.  In addition, the film portays Di Caprio's character as a scared little boy, void of mischeif and youth, despite his hijinks.  So, instead of being a worthy opponent for Hanks, he more or less makes you feel sorry for him.  He's sort of a cross between Oliver Twist and a pitifully  amateur James Bond.  This dampering  portrayal alone takes the whole ""fun"" aspect out of this picture.  Di Caprio never really seems content with his achievements, despite the fact that he twarts the US government on numerous occasions.  And the gloomy dark cloud of his degenerating father heigtens the film's overall dark theme.  It seems that throughout the whole film you're not really sure if you want Di  Caprio to get caught or if you want to give him a hug.  But by the film's climax you don't really care because it took too long to get there and there were too many pace hindering factors in the way.  In a nutshell, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is not entertaining, not exciting, not a thriller, and certainly not fun.  It is however a reasonable drama with good acting from it's principal stars.  Sadly, it's not much else. Check out something else for egde of  your seat suspense and humour all in one.  This isn't it, despite what the critics say.",1056412800,5,2432,4.539170506912442
1477257,5,B00005JLSB,"Steven Speilburg.  All you need to hear is that name on a movie and you already know it's good.  ""Catch Me if you Can"" is no exception on that statement.  Like a few other movies that came out this season, it seems like the moral is that crime does pay.  Think of ""Chicago.""  A girl who shoots and kills a man gets free publicity and becomes a big Vaudeville singer.  Kind of like what happens in ""Catch me if you Can.""  A teenage kid who has a knack for faking stuff runs away from home and becomes an expert check forger, and end's up faking millions of dollars worth of checks, all along being accepted for being a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer.  After he is caught, instead of getting life in prison, got a job with the FBI as an expert on determining how new people are forgeing checks.
Based on a true story, ""Catch me if you Can"" stared Leonardo Decaprio and Tom Hanks.  As I already said, it was directed by Steven Speilburg, and followed some of the same ideas that he uses in his other movies.  There's the usual ""Lost Boy"" theme that Speilburg uses in many of his movies.  DeCaprio plays the ""lost boy"" who is trying to find his way through life, and does this by being a fake.  It's also the first movie in a while by Speilburg that's not science fiction (most recent movies before that: Minority report (Excelent movie) and A.I.). Glad to see a change for something different from a great director.  It seems next we have Indiana Jones IV and Jurassic Park IV to look foward to from this director.
Although this movie was a bit on the long side, I still gotta give it 5 stars.  A great movie...",1056067200,,1607,4.2781456953642385
1477258,4,B00005JLSB,"A true story from director Steven Spielberg based on the autobiograpical book by Frank Abagnale Jr (Played here by Leonardo DiCaprio), CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is an entertaining, if somewhat overlong movie of the young con man who had successfully passed himself off as a pilot, pediatrician and Attorney General of Louisiana in addition to being wanted for fraud in 50 states: all before his 19th birthday!
The movie opens with Abagnale and two imposters pretending to be him on a TV game show, then the story begins in flashback mode (#1). FBI Agent Carl Handratty (Tom Hanks) had his first face to face encounter with Abagnale when Abagnale was imprisoned in France in 1969, after several years attempting to capture him. After being arrested and place on the plane Abagnale begins telling his story to Handratty which leads Spielberg to get tricky and start flashback #2. (Confused? I was at first). This starts the real story of Frank's escapades at Xmas 1963 with Frank watching his father Frank Sr (Christopher Walken) receive a doctorate. As it turns out Dad was also the one who taught Jr the art of scamming: The earliest example is when Frank successfully poses as a substitute French teacher at his own school! Of course along the way he assumes the identities of a Doctor, Lawyer and Pediatrician conning his way to immense wealth and throwing Hanratty off his trail numerous times- even posing as a Secret Service agent trying to help Hanratty!
But then as happens in life, Frank meets a wonderful girl and falls in love so soon he is grappling with the idea of telling her the truth about who he really is; and then risking being arrested and being separated from the woman he loves.
Sure, the story is pretty basic; but CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is still a highly enjoyable and fascinating movie which manages to maintain viewer interest for its full two hours plus running time. Though Leonardo doesn't portray a broad acting range at the best of times he's pretty good here. So is Hanks, but I found it annoying that he recycles his GREEN MILE accent for this character. That's my only quibble. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is easily Spielberg's best movie since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, although as I mentioned earlier his time juggling may confuse first time viewers. Martin Sheen plays Frank's future father-in-law.",1055980800,3,2313,4.770573566084788
1477259,4,B00005JLSB,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, the most successful conman in history. By the age of 19, Frank had already posed as a pilot for Pan Am, paraded around as a medical doctor, and fooled everyone by taking an on-the-side-job as a lawyer. (By the way, he faked a Harvard-graduate diploma to become one.) During this time he cashed fraudulent checks at various banks around the country, and eventually around various places in the world. His is an amazing story, and this film is based on it.
There's no real plot to go into, as I have already given it to you. Other than telling you that the film opens when Frank is sixteen and runs away from home after his parents (Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) have a messy divorce, you pretty much have the setup for a light, fluffy, and altogether fun film.
Frank is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the man hot on his trail, agent Carl Hanratty, is played by Tom Hanks. There isn't really a Carl Hanratty in real life, but it adds to the story. Frank, on the run, actually starts to become friends with Hanratty, who realizes Frank is just an adolescent and does not realize the eventual outcomes of what he is doing. Hanratty sort of adopts Frank, even after he is caught and thrown in a French prison. He helps him get transferred to an American prison, and then even gets him a job in the FBI for spotting fraudulent checks.
I read Frank William Abagnale, Jr.'s true-crime memoir, which was released a few decades ago. It differs from the film at times, and it isn't always as light-hearted as the film is. But in terms of pure, fluffy fun at the movies, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a sure-fire hit. At times it seems to stray a bit too far off the path of realism, unlike the book, but that's part of the fun, really.
The film is entirely watchable, and doesn't try to become an epic. Steven Spielberg creates a real dazzler here; it is effortlessly watchable and even at two and a half hours long, it doesn't become overbearing. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and, unlike most critics, I thought Tom Hanks did a great job in his role.
I especially like how Spielberg captured the image of the '60s so well here, and John Williams' score fits the part of the film very well. And as for the cast, they are all matched perfectly to their characters. I especially liked Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr., who steals every scene he is in. His performance was worthy of its Oscar nom.
If you just want to sit back and relax, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the perfect film for you. There's nothing all that special in the film, but the film kind of becomes special because it is so easy to watch. I recommend ""Catch Me If You Can"" to anyone who can enjoy a movie for what it is.

However, the second part of the movie turned very heavy handed and sad. I wouldn't normally have a problem with this type of transition, except here the comedy part of the movie wasn't comedic enough to satisfy my desire for a comedic film; in effect the first part of the movie had no point.
Then, in the serious part, there wasn't enough drama to make me care for the characters; there was only one major conflict: Tom Hanks trying to catch Leonardo.
Also, the acting, for the most part, was not so great. Christopher Walken was a let-down; for the most part I think he's fantastic but his performance was bland and boring.

But in this end this movie is ultimately about families- specifically, a divorced family. It shows the effect of seperation and death, and what that can lead some people to do.

I am not a fan of Leo but I grudgingly admit he's perfectly cast in the role and handles the character development and emotions of the role masterfully. Why he was passed over at Oscar-time is beyond me. Tom Hanks plays his role with understated complexity and understanding. In the hands of any other actor it would have been easy to play it one-dimensionally, but he pulls subtleties out of the role.

Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Frank, and definitely puts himself into the class of serious good actors.  He hasn't been in a movie with such wide acclaim since Titanic, and this is definitely a movie that will enhance his career.  Tom Hanks is entertaining as the detective, hot on Frank's tale.  His accent may be extremely fake, but it makes for quite humorous exchanges.
The pace of the movie is quick and non stop.  The directing is smooth and done with professionalism.  Some may see the movie as a disgrace to the criminal system, but I see it totally differently.  It's great to see Frank put his skills to good use.  I personally do not see anything wrong with that.
Catch Me If You Can is a tremendous film that finally gives Steven Spielberg a chance to direct without all the focus being on him.  5 Stars",1054080000,3,957,4.448275862068965

1477497,4,B00005JLSB,"We're in the sixties, a time of fun, laughter, love, and trust.  Enter Frank W. Abagnale, Jr.  Frank is a young adult who has decided to take the world by the horns and ride it until he's thrown...into jail.  This movie is Frank's story, adapted for the screen and adjusted slightly to be cinematically compelling.
Frank learned the art of forging checks and took it to a new level.  In the process he flew thousands of miles for free posing as a pilot for Pan Am, cashing bad checks everywhere he went.  Electing to stay in one place for a while, he decides to try his hand at medicine and later law.  All the while, a determined FBI agent by the name of Carl Hanratty is on his trail and refuses to let up.
For those of you who think that this is a bad film because the bad guy (Frank) ""gets away with it"" you should know that he spent years in jail in multiple countries for his crimes.  He then turned his life around completely by making the crimes he committed much harder to perform.
All of the actor's performances are great.  The only problem I really have with this movie was the part of Frank Abagnale, Sr.  Cristopher Walken gives a fine performance, complete with one remarkable moment of vulnrability, but I don't like the way the screenwriters made his character as it was just such a sad man.
A two-disc set, this DVD package comes chock full of extras, including the real breakdown of the man Frank W. Abagnale and his life both as a criminal and an honest man.",1053820800,,1478,4.364963503649635
1477498,2,B00005JLSB,"It baffles me that people rave and rave about this movie as if it were somehow a great achievement of Spielberg to make a movie that has absolutely nothing to say, no great performances, no insights into life or human relationships, and no goal other than to distract its audience for a couple of hours and then be quickly forgotten.
I suppose that if you were really, really bored, then it might be worth your while to watch Tom Hanks and Lenoard DiCaprio run around and utter inane dialogue. I mean, yes, it's a competently made film. If that's all you're looking for, then here it is. But, honestly, I can think of far more entertaining ways to spend two hours.
Spielberg seems to live in a world where there are no black people, no world context for anything that happens, no countries other than the U.S., no cultures other than the white middle-class, and women exist solely to be mothers or pretty (albeit slightly retarded) girlfriends/wives. In Spielberg-World, there are none of the pesky ambiguities of real life.
I suppose that this is the appeal of his movies for so many people... that they are total escapism. Personally, though, I find his homogenous white-bread version of reality to be so superficial and so far removed from reality that it's like eating a plate full of marshmellows and then washing it down with a tall glass of milk.",1053734400,6,1353,4.689075630252101

Speilburg does a great job telling this true story in such a manner where there were very few segments that ""dragged"".  It was serious at times and funny at times.

Right away I was afraid it was going to end up a very boring movie. Also throughout the movie I found myself saying, ""that's just not possible!"". Especially passing the Bar Exam after studying for just two weeks! I suppose it's true, but it takes the fun out of the movie. They should have put the disclaimer at the end of the movie.

The time they took to character build was wasted because the movie really only focused on DiCaprio and Hanks, so it did us little good learning about the ancillary characters as we went along.

Frank Abagnale JR(DiCaprio) does all this as a way to impress his father, played to perfection by Christopher Walken.  The movie follows the FBI's pursuit of the young crook over the period of four years.  This is a good movie with not much to it, but is still worth a view.
 The actors in this movie are what make it as good as it is.  DiCaprio is very good as Abagnale with Hanks his usual excellent self as Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent in pursuit of Abagnale.  Walken was very deserving of his Oscar nomination for his role as DiCaprio's father.  At times he is funny and then other times you feel so bad for him.  During some conversations, I couldn't help but think this was a lot like the relationship between Biff and Willy Loman.

A must see performance for anyone.  Tom Hanks(ditto) as the FBI agent, accent or not, is a genius at his part.  No flaws there.

The result is that we feel compassion for this criminal.  The film does an excellent job of developing his character from the outset.
Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken are also amazing in their supporting roles.  Especially walken.  There is so much hope in his character.  That inspiration slowly erodes as the film progresses.  In turn, Frank Jr's. ambition to relieve his father's sorrow continues to grow.

1477636,4,B00005JLSB,"""Catch me if you Can"" is an entertaining movie directed by that proverbial icon, Steven Spielberg. Call it Spielberg Lite. Perhaps exhausted by his last two films - the deeper and more controversial ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""Minority Report"", Spielberg chose to helm this screen version of the true life story of Frank Abagnale, who in the 1960s successfully posed as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. He also wrote millions of dollars in bad checks. What makes the story even more interesting is the fact that Frank was in his late teens when all of this happened.
A Spielberg project usually involves stellar talent. Here we have Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale, Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent who relentlessly pursues him, and Christopher Walken as Abagnale's father.
The movie truly is a lot of fun. It makes a hero of sorts out of an amoral protagonist, but Hollywood has a grand tradition of doing this - think George Clooney in ""Ocean's Eleven"", for example. After all, it is sometimes gratifying to root for a character who operates outside of the system. My only problem with ""Catch me if you Can"" is this: In Spielberg Lite, the director's tendency to manipulate becomes glaringly apparent. It's all the same heart-sting pulling maneuvers he has been using since ""ET"" twenty years ago, and I find the tactics a bit tiresome. Still, Spielberg at his least ingenious is better than most other directors at their best.",1052611200,,1446,4.882113821138211
1477637,4,B00005JLSB,"Steven Spielberg pulls the ultimate con with Catch Me If You Can. After all, both Hitchcock and Welles alluded to the fact that movies are the ultimate con. Speilberg, regardless how you feel about him, is one of the best at the game. With Catch Spielberg manages to recreate the era right down to the fondue forks perfectly. He also captures the loss of innocence during a time when globalization took flight allowing these type of things to happen.
Leonard Dicaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr with all the warmth and manipulative charm one would expect from a 17 year old who managed to impersonate a French teacher at his own high school for a week, an airline pilot for Pam Am and an ER doctor. It's amazing what charm, a warm smile and salesmanship can do to move people into your back pocket.
Tom Hanks plays against type here. His Tom Hanratty is a social inept but amazingly bright FBI agent that wrote the book check fraud. His lack of social grace clearly initially undermines his ability to negoiate promotion within the FBI. It's his smarts that save him and, surprisingly, the closer he gets to catching Abagnale, the more he comes to admire and pity him. He also picks up many of the social graces and characteristics that make Frank so likable. He still maintains his gruff FBI exterior but but softens overtime on the inside. Hanks gives a truly marvelous performance.
It's a pity that they couldn't have given two Academy Awards for best supporting actor. Walken's turn as Frank's father is the most powerful he's done in years. He manages to capture the combination that drives Frank senior in all of a few scenes--his brashness, insecurity, salesmanship, charm and sadness. He's one of America's underappreciated actors.
The rest of the cast is solid and manages to convey the feel of the time in their performances.
John Williams' unusual score recalls the jazzy film scores from the late 50's and early 60's. It's one of Williams best least combastic scores in years.
The Saul Bass like title design also manages to capture the feel of the time and films quite well. All of these elements capture the feel Spielberg was looking for. Spielberg, like Hitchcock, has his entertainments and his serious films. Catch Me is Spielberg's North By Northwest--it's not a lesser film because it isn't as serious as Minority Report or emotionally wretching as AI. Spielberg, like Hitch, manages the rare feat of tackling a number of themes, styles and types of films well. While Catch Me isn't Spielberg's best film, it's one of his richest and most enjoyable entertainments in years.

1477772,5,B00005JLSB,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is the story of real-life con artist Frank Abagnale, Jr. who, in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when he was between the ages of 16 and 21, wrote $2.5 million dollars in bad checks and became one of the most notorious con men in American history. The film follows Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) from his early high school pranks to his check-printing operation and eventual capture in France five years later. FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) doggedly pursues Frank as he successfully impersonates an air line pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, living the life of a playboy and cashing ingeniously forged checks all along the way.

""Catch Me If You Can"" was directed by Stephen Spielberg and, along with Minority Report, signifies a revival of Spielberg's directing talent after fifteen years of mediocre-at-best filmmaking. This film is fairly light fare, but it is immensely entertaining, funny, touching, and impeccably cast. Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a perfect fit for Leonardo DiCaprio, and is probably his best role since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". Tom Hanks seems to have abandoned his typically saccharine roles this year -much to his credit- and puts in a wonderful performance as sympathetic geeky G-man Carl Hanratty (along with a terrific showing in ""Road to Perdition""). Christopher Walken was the only actor to receive an Oscar nomination for ""Catch Me If You Can"". His performance as Frank Abagnale, Sr., our protagonist's down-and-out father, deserved the honor. Frank Jr.'s awkward combination of admiration and pity for his father seems to have been a key motivator in his illustrious life of crime, and Christopher Walken really helps us understand that.

The real Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a successful security consultant these days, protecting businesses from white collar crime. He cooperated with and bascially likes the film, but is quick to point out that ""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on his biography of the same name that was written about 25 years ago. Mr. Abagnale says that some aspects of his experiences were exaggerated in that book and some have been altered for the movie as well. Whatever the inaccuracies, Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s immense intelligence, ambition, and guts are the most striking elements of the film. It's the rarity of finding all of these qualities in such abundance in one person that make Frank's character so fascinating, and make him one of cinema's most lovable antiheroes.

I highly recommend ""Catch Me If You Can"" for its great performances and its extremely entertaining story of an ingenious con man and his noble pursuer...made all the more interesting because the story is largely true.",1052438400,135,2667,5.056818181818182

1477776,5,B00005JLSB,"After his dark, sci-fi work on A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report, Steven Spielberg returns to more lighter fare with the engaging and entertaining Catch Me If You Can.  The film is based on the true story of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., who by the age of nineteen passes himself off as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and cashes over four million dollars worth of fraudulent checks.  The film is told in a flashback style, opening with Frank being extricated from a French prison and brought back to the U.S. to face charges and bounces back and forth between his trip home and his exploits in the previous few years.  Leonardo DiCaprio is perfectly cast as Frank.  His boyish good looks and charm work to his advantage as the young con man.  Mr. DiCaprio gives a multi-layered performance as beneath the surface Frank is really a young man who is devastated by his parents divorce and wants only to please his father and see his parents back together again.  Mr. DiCaprio has never been better and it is certainly the equal of his Oscar nominated performance in Whats Eating Gilbert Grape.  Tom Hanks gives yet another superb performance as the dogged FBI agent Carl Hanratty who tracks Frank across the US and eventually to France where he finally captures him.  Mr. Hanks plays Carl as a by-the-numbers agent, who shows no outward mercy to Frank, but has compassion for the kid because of his situation.  Christopher Walken is excellent as well as Franks father, who loses everything to the IRS because of a fraud investigation.  His contempt towards the government as they strip away everything in his life is both hilarious and heartbreaking.  Mr. Walken received a deserved nomination as Best Supporting Actor in 2002.  There are other good performances by Amy Adams as a girl who Frank becomes engaged to, Martin Sheen as her father, Nathalie Baye as Franks French mother and Jennifer Garner has a bizarre cameo as a model who propositions Frank for an evening of pleasure.  While these performances are all since, they are mere sidebars to the triangle between Frank, Carl and Franks father.  The cat and mouse hunt between Frank and Carl is tension filled and briskly paced.  Mr. Spielberg keeps the action moving and he never lets you up for air.  The film has been criticized for not diving deeper into what made Frank do what he did or get in the mechanics of fraud, but thats not the point of the film.  It is the chase between the two leads.  You know that Frank will eventually get caught, but where, when and how will it happen.  Mr. Spielberg does gloss over some issues and the film does take some liberties, most notably that is no real Carl Hanratty.  Frank did have a main contact at the FBI, but there was a large team of investigators who tracked and caught him.  But the role of Carl is needed in the film as the chase becomes personal and the emotional focus of the film.  All in all, Catch Me If You Can is perfectly crafted film, full of lively performances, a sharp script and crisp direction.  This film yet again shows why Mr. Spielberg is among the greatest directors of this or any generation.",1052438400,2,3134,4.63768115942029
1477777,4,B00005JLSB,"The problem with ""Catch Me If You Can"" depends on whether you are vexed with the director or the starring actors.  If you go the Dawson Leery route and are a fan of Steven Spielberg then it seems the complaint is that this film is no ""E.T.,"" ""Jurassic Park"" or ""Schindler's List.""  But if you are a fan of Tom Hanks then the complaint would be that this is not a ""Philadelphia,"" ""Forrest Gump,"" or ""Cast Away.""  The idea that Spielberg and Hanks, who worked together on ""Saving Private Ryan,"" would spend there time on this trifle seems to be too much for some fans to take.  But then Leonardo DiCaprio, who has seen little sign of the critical success (""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"") or box office success (""Titanic"") of his earlier days is probably just happy to have had movies with Spielberg and Martin Scorsese out at the same time.  Okay, so ""Catch Me If You Can"" is not a great film.  It is a very good film and that puts all the parties concerned ahead of the game given the standard fare from Hollywood.
The story might not be about life and death, but it is certainly compelling.  Young Frank W. Abagnale Jr (DiCaprio) runs away from home rather than deal with the divorce of his parents and has to live by his wits and the checkbook in his back pocket.  It turns out his wits are pretty good and he is not only able to pass millions of dollars worth of bad checks, but pass himself off as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  Doggedly pursuing him is F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks), who knows that Frank is really a beggarman and thief.  Actually, we know that Frank will get his man, because that is how the film opens, and it is as Hanratty is bringing Frank back to the United States from France that the story is revealed.
""Catch Me If You Can,"" based on Abagnale's biography, is the story of an engaging rogue who uses his charm and aforementioned quick wits to get himself out of one sticky situation after another.  The man had panache, which is exemplified when he has to get through the Miami airport despite the fact Hanratty has F.B.I. agents at every other line.  The movie is not really a primer for a life of crime since Abagnale's did his con man act in the Sixties and technology has advanced well beyond his effective use of a bathtub full of water and model airplanes to make thousands of dollars.
In addition to the questions regarding how Frank does it and how Hanratty catches him, there is the relationship between the two men as well as the relationship between Frank and his father (Christopher Walken), from whom he gets his charm and sense of larceny.  It is when the film operates on this level that ""Catch Me If You Can"" becomes another classic Spielberg film, at least in the sense of the constant theme of symbolic fathers and sons, even if it never gets churned into real butter.
This is an enjoyable film even if it does not fall into the category of joining other Spielberg, Hanks, and DiCaprio films that you have in your video library for convenient repeat viewing.  There is a bonus disc with the DVD version, which only has 75 minutes worth of extra material, mostly about the real Frank Abegnale Jr. (maybe when Spielberg has to put kids through college or something he will break down and start doing commentary tracks so I can get enjoy a course in filmmaking in the comfort of my own home).  If you really are insulted by Spielberg and Hanks doing this project, just wait until next year's ""Terminal.""  Hang in there.",1052352000,,3475,4.483359746434231
1477778,4,B00005JLSB,"Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, a natural born con-man, and a real person.  At first Frank is merely an imposter.  However, as the movie progresses Frank begins to find out how easy it is to write bad checks and to forge documents that are his entry into jobs such as doctor, lawyer and even jet pilot.  Eventually, the forgeries begin running into millions of dollars, and Frank risks making a mistake that will cause someone's death.
Two events lead to Frank's eventual undoing.  First, Frank falls in love.  As with all great con men, falling in love is nearly always a precursor to doom, as we have previously discovered in movies such as ""The Music Man"" and ""The Distinguished Gentleman"".  Once a con man falls in love, he begins to care, and once he begins to care, eventually he realizes that there are other things in life besides being a con man.  The other event is a chance meeting with Tom Hanks, playing FBI agent Carl Hanratty.  Once Tom Hanks is on the trail of Frank, he doesn't let go for the rest of the movie, eventually tracking him down and catching him.
One of the problems with the movie is that it is a little difficult to understand Frank's motivations.  Frank was put into a situation in his life where he felt he was in an untenable situation.  Further, he was extremely intelligent.  Frank didn't really think about becoming an imposter and writing bad checks, it just happened, and being successful as an imposter and at getting money by writing bad checks then created a lifestyle that in many ways Frank enjoys.  However, if you have not been faced with the kind of emotional stress Frank faced, it may be difficult to understand why Frank did what he did.
Another problem is with Tom Hanks.  Tom plays a character similar to the character he played in ""Dragnet"".  In some ways Carl Hanratty appears to be a stereotype.  However, I can imagine that in the 1960s check fraud was not a high-profile and glamorous job in the FBI, instead relegated to nerdy types better suited for doing research than for breaking down doors and pulling guns.  If you consider the kinds of people that historically have systematically written bad checks for large sums of money, these people are often intelligent and well-organized, and it requires a special skill to find these people.  Carl Hanratty was perfect for the job, though initially somewhat naive.
I was reminded of ""The Great Imposter"" starring Tony Curtis as I watched this movie.  I was fascinated by the story of Ferdinand Demara, who typically impersonated doctors.  Both that movie and this one have their strong points, but I give the nod to this movie for greater entertainment value, assuming you can get through the occasionally confusing first half of the movie.
I am not a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan.  However, Leo is a perfect fit as Frank Abagnale.  In my opinion this role may be one of Leo's best performances, in the same league as his performance in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"".  At the very least Leo should have gotten a nomination by someone for his acting in this movie, which was very good.
Creating a movie such as this is a difficult task.  It is sometimes difficult for a modern audience to put itself into an era that, while not so very long ago, is very different from what they have experienced.  Further, it may also be difficult to understand the motivations of someone like Frank.  Director Steven Spielberg tries very hard to accomplish both tasks.  In the first part of the movie, I struggled somewhat trying to put the pieces together and follow the rapidly evolving plot, and sometimes had to pick up answers from later in the movie, but I felt overall the effort and the ending was worth the wait; 4 stars for a very entertaining movie about a challenging subject.",1052352000,,3784,4.695454545454545

1477780,3,B00005JLSB,"Like 1999's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" Steven Speilberg's breezy ""Catch Me If You Can"" tells the story of a young man who enjoys life's riches through an identity that's not his own.  Leo DiCaprio is Frank Abagnale, Jr., a teenager who spends the mid-1960s posing as an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer--all the while cashing checks around the world that ring to the tune of $2.5 million.  His quick wit and suave demeanor are apparently enough to make unsuspecting strangers believe at face value anything Frank says.  Hot on his tail, however, is an FBI agent (Tom Hanks, in a supporting role) who's determined to nail Frank and end his streak of ruthless deception.  DiCaprio fits into his role like a pair of well-worn jeans and seems more confortable with his material than he did in Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York.""  Productionwise, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is also a success, as it captures the flavor and texture of the 1960s admirably through its colors and fashions.  I just wished the film would dig a little deeper into Frank's background which could shed some light as to why he decided to be a juvenile con man.  Sure, we know Frank's parents divorced (Christopher Walken, who plays Frank's dad, earned his Oscar nomination, by the way), but not all kids with mommy/daddy issues turn into sophisticated criminals.  And, at 2 hours and 20 minutes, ""Catch Me If You Can"" gets a bit long-winded and could use some trimming.  To be honest, this movie doesn't represent the cream of Speilberg's crop, and it pales a bit in comparison to the far more engaging ""Minority Report,"" also released in 2002.  As for the DVD itself, I don't understand why it needed to have 2 discs.  The movie and the bonus material (which consists mostly of glossy featurettes) could have fit into one DVD.  Despite this, the film's lighthearted spirit and agreeable tone make it still worth ""catch""-ing.",1052265600,3,1891,4.766871165644171

It was a movie I had looked forward to for months, having read the book and heard of Frank Abagnale's amazing story of deceipt and fraud arround the world while still a teenager. Amazingly, Speilburg and company flubbed it, spending entirely too much time on Abagnale's family dynamics and his parent's marital problems and not nearly enough time just telling the incredible story of this young man's adventures. There was so much fodder here for a wonderful movie that I was very surprised how average the end product was. Decaprio, for my money, never got the right balance of calculating intelligence and nerves of steel of the real Frank Abagnale. Decraprio's Abagnale was all luck and pluck. A casting of someone like Matt Damon would have been far better. The movie's greatest flaw was it's meandering into the fictional and distracting story line of Abagnale's parent's marriage. All said, this was still an entertaining movie with good actors and a talented director. It is just sad that since it is likely that this story will be told on film only once and has been a long time coming that it did not live up to it's potential.",1052265600,,1277,4.705357142857143

1477901,5,B00005JLSB,"It is not often that I get to see a movie that has so many preconceived ideas eminating from other and similar films as well as an effective use of nostalgia carefully mixed with psychological undertones.  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN brings to mind Tony Curtis as Ferdinand Waldo Demarra of THE GREAT IMPOSTER.  However, in Curtis' case, his quest for identity was vaguely undefined as he sloughed his skins more for the sheer joy of it than for any other ostensible purpose.  Leonardo DiCaprio made it clear early on that his own quest was based on a need to restore his moral universe, one in which was threatened by the dissolution of his parents' marriage.  DiCaprio, as Frank Abagnale,Jr, idolized his parents.  When they danced, the joy in his eyes was unmistakable.  It was when they stopped dancing, that the world of marital discord intruded.  Christopher Walken, as Frank's con man father, gives a powerful performance as a smooth talking yet ineffective businessman whose only success in life was to have married a desirable Frenchwoman some twenty years earlier.  It is Walken's constant harping of his landing her that, over the years, became the central mantra for his son's life.  In the young Frank's eyes, his mother became a symbol of all that was noble and beautiful, and if it were a lack of money and success that doomed his father to lose her, then it became his own mission in life to reconnect them.  All of the scams that Frank Jr. pulled off are seen not as to enrich his own wallet, but to act as the glue to reestablish the natural order of things.  DiCaprio's most touching scenes are the most easily overlooked. In a restaurant, he is dressed as a co-pilot, treating his father to a fancy meal.  During the conversation, in front of his father's astonished eyes, he casually pushes the keys to a brand new Cadillac parked just outside.  ""Take them, Dad,"" he pleads, ""won't Mom be impressed.""  There are many scenes like that which allow Frank to make it clear that his crimes of theft and forgery mask a talent that under different circumstances might have allowed him to be in  the flesh those fake uniformed superficial entities that now register in the mind as the prototypical demi-gods that ruled the television screens of the 60s.
Tom Hanks, as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, registers as a sort of combination of pseudo-father figure whose respect Frank wishes with a more than subtle undertone as Frank's Dr. Richard Kimble to Carl's Detective Gerard.  But unlike that fugitive, this one plays his escapes with style and a sense of not wishing to blend in.  Where Dr. Kimble sought work as dishwashers, Frank Abagnale flew only in the highest stratospheres of our cultures.  Not only did he want the job of pilot, doctor, and lawyer, he wanted their badge and uniform too. This connection of Carl Hanratty as father-confessor and father-surrogate slowly accrues its own kinetic energy until by the film's end, the bond between Frank and Carl was at least as strong as the one that Frank tried so hard to forge with his own father.  By the time the closing credits roll, Frank shows that the simple respect that one human being can feel for another can be enough to turn around a life that for a few short years seemed headed for a tragedy that this film thankfully avoided.  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of the most entertaining films of the year that in its own way points out the need for people to connect in a manner not unlike that Jimmy Stewart posited in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.",1051920000,2,3506,4.651539708265802
1477902,4,B00005JLSB,"The Spielberg canon can pretty much be divided into two categories.  On the one hand, there is the escapist, fantasy Spielberg (ET, Close Encounters, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park), where the movies are enormously entertaining but leave the viewer without any real insights.  On the other hand is the more recent serious Spielberg (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) which present serious topics & stunning character studies, but are at times so intense and raw as to be unwatchable.  The second category forced the film industry finally to acknowledge Spielberg as one of the great filmmakers of his time, rather than a commercially successful lightweight.
After finally being taken seriously, Spielberg faced the new challenge of making a film which bridged the categories, one that was both entertaining and thought-provoking.  He has largely succeeded with ""Catch Me if You Can.""
To me the film was largely a study of the character of two men, the elder and younger Frank Abagnale.  The father (in one of the best performances by Christopher Walken I have ever seen) imparts to his son the philosophy that ""if you act successful, you will be perceived as successful.""  Despite a lifetime of defeats and setbacks, Abagnale Sr. always keeps his chin and plays the part of a man who has the upper hand in life.  Appearance is everything.
Abagnale Jr. takes this philosophy to its logical extreme.  Play the part, and you will become the part.  As long as he had the nerve to be deceive people into thinking he was a pilot, a doctor, or a lawyer, then that was exactly what he was, despite having no skills (although he did pass the bar exam) in those fields.
It is interesting that the movie viewer is almost encouraged to indulge in moral relativism and root for Abagnale Jr. as he practices this massive deception, as well as massive fraud.  Will basically lying to every person he meets, Abagnale Jr. also embarks on a fraudulent check scheme of an almost unimaginable scale, passing nearly $2.5 million in bad checks.  But one is left with the impression that it isn't a crime until you get caught, especially if the crime is executed with such virtuosity.
The one character in the film who sees Abagnale Jr. for the criminal he is, is Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is portrayed a bloodless pedant bereft of any humor.  The one man who represents authority, and is able finally to bring an end to Abagnale Jr.'s crime spree comes off as being rather unsympathetic to the viewer.
You can't help but hope that Abagnale Jr. doesn't get caught.  The chase that unfolds is absolutely fascinating, and the sheer nerve that is displayed is awe-inspiring.  I suspect that most of us have an inner con man that is fighting to get out, but we are too chicken to risk the consequences.
Enjoy ""Catch Me if You Can,"" and let your inner con man live vicariously through the film.",1051920000,,2874,4.791497975708502
1477903,3,B00005JLSB,"In Ancient China they sentenced counterfeiters to work in the mint. That could be the underlying message of this movie. Intelligence will find a way to get what it thinks it deserves if unrecognized and unrewarded in the normal course of events.
Young bright a-little-lazy kid watches his dad just a little too closely, and becomes just like him only better. Christopher Walkien is excellent as the dad; moody, manipulative, eager to be recognized and top-of-the-heap. And the son inherited double doses of all these with a chutzpa without end. At seventeen, with barely any facial hair he pretends to be a mid-20's airplane pilot. Fills his apartment with bikini clad blondes, all financed by kiting checks.
If you excuse the making of a criminal who rips off banks for more than 4million, he is a hero, outrunning the FBI and tricking their best agent on the spur of the moment. but the real point is talent needs to be, demands to be recognized, and thankfully in this case it was....

All the while, he is being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), whose dedication to catching Abagnale borders on obsessive.
While the main focus of the film is on Abagnale's genius for defrauding the government, deceiving just about anyone with whom he comes into contact, and the ensuing cat and mouse game with the FBI, it also allows us a glimpse into the underlying roots of his deception.  His father Frank Abagnale Sr., portrayed with great depth and sincerity by Christopher Walken, has a penchant for deceit himself but when his business and marriage fall apart it ignites his son's strong yearning to restore the life and family they once had and ultimately his ambitious yet perilous journey into high stakes fraud.

It doesn't want to give an example, it doesn't discuss a political, religious or social issue, it just entretains; and that's the beauty of it.  It only tells a story, a real (and sometimes unbelievable) story, and leaves you thinking about Abagnale's great capacity and intelligence and Hanratty's great determination to not only catch this kid, but to use his abilities to turn him in the right path.

As far as acting is concerned this ones a winner...stellar performances specially by Christopher Walken and Tom Hanks...they are both solid professional actors and they diliver...DeCaprio is young and no where near the level of his fellow cast members but here he does show singns of the great talent he displayed ealier on in his carreer during his basketball Diaries and Whats Eating Gilbert Grape glory days.

Now imagine for a moment trying to walk into all of these lives in the course of only four or five years.  Sound difficult?  What if you tried to do all of this between the ages of 16 and 21?  Tough, huh?  This is the life that was lived by Frank Abagnale, Jr. for a period of time in the 1970s and was recently adapted by Steven Spielberg into the film Catch Me If You Can.
Leonard DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr., the charming conman who seems to be always one step ahead of the FBI agent in pursuit, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  Based on the true story, this film is a departure from recent works for both Spielberg and DiCaprio.  Spielbergs Minority Report, A.I., and Saving Private Ryan, while all being fantastically directed films haven't exactly been, well, fun. The same goes for DiCaprios roles in Gangs of New York and The Beach.  As for Tom Hanks  we all know theres nothing the man cant do.

Supporting actors, set design, and a score, for starters.  Luckily, this film holds strong on all counts.  Christopher Walken, for example, plays the role of Frank Abagnale, Sr. brilliantly.

Well, it's a true story based on the life of Frank Abnigale and his autobiographical novel of the same name.

And we identify sympathetically with Frank and his bold and technically sophisticated crimes.

What I like about this movie is that it shows an interesting story (adaptation of a true story) without being too pretentious (which is one of the main problems I find in Spielberg - ex.

Leonardo pulled off the role of a teenager very well and i think did the true con justice.

1477992,3,B00005JLSB,"Steven Spielberg is THE director for making films on profound, human topics (""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan""). This time he tried a comedy based on a true story -- about a notorious cheque forger, Frank William Abagnale Jr., who got to the list of FBI's most wanted men in 1960's while still in his teens.
The film starts gloriously -- the opening titles are one of the best I've ever seen, accompanied by John Williams' trademark first-class music. The magic works a little bit longer but ultimately fails.
Don't get me wrong. ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a decent piece of entertaining cinema. But it looks like Spielberg was trying to apply some of his typical mix of melodramatic flair and deep undertones to the film (family values and so on) and went just half-way. Too serious for a pure comedy, too light for a deeper substance.
Actors do not disappoint, though. Leonardo DiCaprio turns in an all-round performance, worthy of the Golden Globe nomination  he got for playing Frank Jr. Tom Hanks slowly but surely is typecasted as a bulky good guy (after ""Road to Perdition""), portraying FBI's Carl Hanratty. And Christopher Walken almost steals the show as Frank Abagnale, Sr. (well-deserved British BAFTA award for supporting actor). Well-cast was also the French actress Nathalie Baye -- her English is justified by French descent of her character.
Yeah. Catch this film if you want. An average movie goer should not be disappointed. However, if ""Minority Report"" and even ""A.I. The Artificial Intelligence"" had you thinking and you hope for more, be warned.",1050796800,2,1573,4.958333333333333
1477993,4,B00005JLSB,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is a genuine throwback, made with a light touch and finger-snapping charm, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, finally, in a movie star performance. If he hits a down note as 1960s con artist Frank Abagnale I'd like to see it.
 Director Steven Spielberg, too, gears back his tendency to pile on the portent, although there are few scenes of thick soup drama that seem to jar us out of our enjoyment. Mostly, however, ""Catch Me"" is an easybreezer about a kid who finds the one thing he does well, does it with extraordinary ease, and eludes the entire FBI mail fraud division for years while he does it. The highest-concept script floating around Hollywood couldn't tell a better tall-but-true tale.
 Frank Abagnale was a kid of above average smarts with a slick, quick-thinking businessman for a dad (Christopher Walken) and a mannered, spoiled French mother (the estimable Nathalie Baye). When Frank Sr. gets tagged by the IRS, his wife swiftly sours on him and gets a divorce. That sets up a scene where, on the spot, Frank Jr. has to decide where, and with whom, he'll live, and Frank Jr. bolts, beginning a five-year run of check fraud unlike anything before or since.
 The movie better explains the mechanics of just how Frank Jr. rips off Pan-Am Airlines, his chosen victim for the stunning no-questions-asked treatment afforded pilots at the time. Later, he becomes a doctor in Georgia, then a lawyer in Louisiana, where his run nearly ends when he gets involved with a rich girl (Amy Adams) and decides to marry.
 On Frank's ""tale"" is FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) a straight-arrow investigator with a better taste for magnetic ink than human relations. Hanks personally asked for the role, and he makes a nice, determined foil. ""How else do you think this is going to end?"" is his standard line to Frank. A kinship develops, the kind of kinship between two acknowledged, lonely professionals on opposite sides of a business, and when the game comes to a final close, Carl goes a mile -- and further -- for Frank when most ""kinder"" agents would have let the chips fall where they may.
  Frank Jr. also tries to keep a tenuous connection with his father when he can, and Walken, in a few scenes, essays a broken, disillusioned man just about as well as an actor can. Frank Sr. barely hides his seething under the polish of his false optimism; Walken, as usual, gives his lines an ever-changing, jazzlike cadence; his performances are mysteries all themselves. He's beautiful in this movie.
 And look at DiCaprio! So cautious in both ""The Beach"" and ""Gangs of New York,"" Leo seems to have refound the confidence the groove he flaunted in his early career. The role suits him -- DiCaprio still looks like a boy, so playing young is easy -- and it may, in fact, turn out to be one of his best roles. DiCaprio, because of his face and voice, will always struggle with movies on the other side of the track; better he should play to his good looks and his easy-to-smile demeanor. Frank Abagnale is a Cary Grant/Jimmy Stewart kind of guy, and DiCaprio can be their heir, should he want the mantle. ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a hell of a start.",1050537600,,3163,4.647584973166368

Every detail is perfect in this period piece, from cars to hair, etc.  There is a real gracefulness to the flow of the characters from scene to scene.  It is fluid, like dancing, even when the characters are on the run.
The subject matter is fascinating.  I don't know how much the story was embellished for the movie, but if even a fraction of it is true, Frank Abagnale, the infamous counterfeiter, should be as legendary as Butch and Sundance.  What is fact is that Abagnale stole over $4 million during the 1960s using counterfeit checks.  He was a pioneer in fraud, and as a reformed thief, he has been a pioneer in fraud detection and prevention.  I'm inspired to read Abagnale's autobiography of the same name.
The reason I only give the movie four stars is that it won't be something I watch even annually.  While it is an excellent film, the characters are not endearing and I do not identify with their struggle.  That's as it should be.  For Spielberg to make this movie more heart-tugging would have meant resorting to cliched plot devices that are thankfully not part of his repetoire.",1050192000,,1160,4.698019801980198
1477995,5,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me If You Can, based on the experiences of a real life con artist, is a more light-hearted affair than one would expect from Steven Spielberg.  I would agree to an extent with the Amazon reviewer who claimed this film to be ""shallow"", but then I think that was the whole point.  Spielberg's big successes over the last decade have been the likes of `Schindler's List' and `Saving Private Ryan'; very thought heavy, serious films, I think on this one he just wanted to relax and make a movie that would entertain.  And there's nothing wrong with that, after all, doesn't he deserve to more than anyone else?
It is the films three leading performances that make the film such a joy to watch.  Leonardo Di Caprio very much suits the role of the conman Frank Abagnale  and delivers a better performance than he does in `Gangs of New York'.  The underrated Christopher Walken is also superbly witty as Abagnale's father, and as FBI agent Hanratty, Tom Hanks is as brilliant as ever.  And to top it all off, there is a cameo from the beautiful Jennifer Garner.
I have to admit, the film did start very lightly, and I thought this movie was going to be a real flop, but thankfully I was proved wrong.  After fifteen or so minutes, it really got going, and stayed at that level for the rest of the film.  Most of the joy from the film came from watching Abagnale perform and get away with feigning as someone he isn't.
I would say that this was my favourite movie of 2002, and I preferred it to Spielberg's last film `Minority Report'.  As with the alien in ET, and the soldiers in `Saving Private Ryan', `Catch Me If You Can' yet again explores the director's recurring theme of characters longing to be home.",1049241600,,1708,4.480645161290322
1478076,5,B00005JLSB,"A funny film about a faultless fraud, a perfect forger who manipulated bank checks and stole a real fortune in the 60s when he was not even out of high school and at the same time he impersonated all types of professions, pilot, doctor, lawyer, and many others all around the world, or nearly, and he ended up in prison in Atlanta for twelve years in total isolation. And yet the FBI who finally caught him in France got him out of the prison in which they had locked him up, because he was the best-qualified forger on the market and they needed him to catch as many of these forgers who were myriads and legions in those years when the two ways to pay for anything was either cash or a check.

Very entertaining in a way though of course, the depth of the story is that you better be a good forger because then you will have a beautiful career in the FBI. The more advanced cases of fraud today is no longer forgers of checks but hackers. The best of these hackers are recruited to work for all kinds of security services, both public and private. It is good to be reminded at times that the worst frauds and the best forgers of anything, hackers or Internet fraud-artists, are often working for the CIA, the FBI, Homeland Security or the big corporation like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook.

And with Artificial Intelligence it becomes ever easier to set up a scam of any sort that can access millions of computers in the world and create chaos here or there. At the same time, it is often a lot easier to counter such actions with Artificial Intelligence too. The attack from the USA against the nuclear centrifuges in Iran some years ago was identified and blocked by other hackers and AI specialists from Belarus, California and a couple more places.

That should make us think twice before launching any propaganda against such frauds, actions, cyberwar acts, because if a digital system is attacked, its because its security is underdeveloped, or if a social network is used to spread fake news or whatever rumors to influence public opinion here or there, it cannot be stopped nor prevented except with censorship, and even so there is always a way to go around this censorship and reach a disturbing objective here and there, in any country you can think of. Cybercrime and cyberwar are the prices we have to pay for cyberspace and cyber communication. It is better to build some efficient defense than to cry, yell and scream because after a while no one believes there is a fire in the house or there is a wolf in the poultry yard.

Society as a factory of criminals
By Dr Jacques COULARDEAU on March 31, 2003

In this film Steven Spielberg wants to entertain us with a simple plot, a simple situation, a great chase around the world. He wants to entertain us with two characters who are highly attractive. The young man who becomes a criminal because his father is harrassed by the IRS and whose wife is stolen away by his best friend can easily become a symbol of fighting back, resilience, rebellion, intelligence against a system that tries to crush all those who may be antisocial, or just appear to be antisocial. The second character of the cop who is chasing this young man is just as attractive.

Divorced, having lost wife and daughter, abandoned and isolated in his personal life, living the life of a hermit, of a monk of the law against crime, he easily becomes a father substitute to the young man and chases him with real paternal care and even maybe love. This relation between the criminal and the cop is amazingly reassuring. The young criminal becomes a hero because he attacks the economic system and is more intelligent than the businessmen and CEOs of this system.

The cop becomes a hero because he is not viciously chasing a criminal he is ready to kill if necessary, but he chases him to protect him against his own desire to fool the system, and to give him the opportunity to really become  social  by using his talent and his intelligence against the criminals who attack the system. This will lead me to the conclusion on this point : this film is in a way a denunciation of the economic and political system that tries to destroy its opponents by all means available, including in their private life, due to a total lack of ethics on the side of the proponents of this system.

Why does our system produce such a phenomenal highjacking of intelligence into crime ? But the film also has another interest. Leonardo Di Caprio reveals himself as able to impersonate many characters and personalities in this film and this is the proof that he is improving and developing. He is able to become, in the near future, a good and even great actor, provided his body and face are put aside and his acting talent is emphasized. That is all the more important because he is getting old and will no longer be able to play the handsome and lovable teenagers he has played so often. He is entering the real profession : he is enabled by this film to show that he can act with his soul and not only with his body.

1478077,5,B00005JLSB,"What a fresh and surprising performance by DiCaprio, whom I have never favored before, particularly in the blockbuster ""Titanic.""  Here his character Frank evolves and resonates with fragility, bravado, wit and pathos.  Tom Hanks's Carl likewise is no one-dimensional cop, but a fully formed individual whose apparent staleness is deceptive and simultaneously revealing--his work is his life, and yet he expresses care for his duaghter and, ultimately, for Frank.
""Catch Me"" entertains on many levels and proves rewatchable--for me a mark of all great films.  Other reviewers have commented that the film is not deep and epic and enduring as are some of Spielberg's other works.  I respond that Carl and Frank developed a unique and believable relationship whose complexity and universality combine to produce subtle import and audience identification surpassing the shallow feel-good wrap-up lesser films pander to their audiences.  The film's true-story aspect played only a minor role for me, as the story was of a boy needing stability and love, and of a man lost to his own family redeeming himself through this particular case.
Oh, and don't invite Carl Hanratty to tell jokes at your next party. ""Knock, knock.""
Who's there is a compelling story, the truth of which only serves to buttress a well-outfitted period chase film bent on revealing to its audience a pursuit of belonging and identity.  Matt Damon in ""The Bourne Identity"" sought to regain an identity he had lost.  Here DiCaprio and Hanks aim to assemble identities and connections they have never had.
This fine film definitely lives a step above the action genre or shallower ""buddy"" ventures.  So (groan) cath it if you can.",1048809600,2,1695,5.160583941605839
1478078,4,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me does not have the heaviness of a Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, both were, last time I checked, under Steven Spielberg's resume. But here, Speilberg is not out to dazzle us or make us think deeply about our lives; this movie was made to entertain.
Leornado Dicaprio, who has been missing after enormous success in Titanic, finds his key here (unlike Gangs of New York) and gives a fine performance as the sly con artist. The real great performance here was Chris Walken, who plays Dicaprio's father. He is strangely optimistic and takes pride in his son's accomplishments. Tom Hanks is solid as usual, enough said. Spielberg has great mastery of atmosphere and fills the screen with bright and retro colors.
Catch Me is not going to win many Oscars (even though Walken should), but its lightheartedness will win success for this touching film and Dicaprio may regain his status as a major heartthrob.",1048291200,,919,4.859872611464968

It's not quite as entertaining as I though it would be, but the fact that it's enjoyable enough help make the movie, considering that it's quite shallow, and doesn't really go indepth. This movie really is more about surface glimmer,than actual depth. Leonardo DiCaprio was ok, as was Tom Hanks. Christopher Walken, in my opinion gave the best performance as the father of the ""real fake"" Frank Abagnale jr. I'm not a fan of Steven Spielberg's work in general. And this film was very surface,and seemed to realy rush itself to get to the ending.",1048291200,4,588,4.718446601941747

Leonard DiCaprio is excellent in a complex and well acted role.  Tom Hanks is solid as always, although his faux-Boston accent is a tad grating at times.  John Williams has produced a score that is more subtle than his usual efforts, and quite effective in setting the mood for the various scenes.  And Steven Spielberg does his usual highly professional job of directing.  The film fails to be anything especially thrilling, but I can't imagine many people claiming that watching it was a waste of time.
I loved the period feel of the film.  Most of the decor felt just right.  At no point was it anything less than a joy to behold
The only problem with the film is that in the end, it just isn't very memorable.  I loved the performances, I loved the set and art design, I loved the score.  But I felt far less moved by the film than I would have anticipated.

In the end it all worked out for hanks anyway. Dicaprio was sent to jail and because of his intelligence for printing money he knew what money was real and what wasnt. He was released from prison and had to work at the police station to catch out these criminals.

1478083,5,B00005JLSB,"I hated Leonardo DiCaprio until I saw this. I thought he was a sissy (Man in the Iron Mask, Titanic, Romeo and Juliet). He really surprised me with this one though.

The best role of the whole film though went to Christopher Walken, playing as DiCaprio's Father who became a total loser. Chris Walken was amazing. It truly was his best role since his oscar-winning performance in ""The Deer Hunter"" in 1978. Stephen Spielberg is an impressive director who always comes through. ""Catch Me if you Can"" is among the finest con artist movies I've seen. I can't wait until May 6th to buy the dvd. This isn't something that really young kids should see, nor would they enjoy it.

1478084,4,B00005JLSB,"Catch Me If You Can is one of the most captivating movies I have seen in a long time. Not visually, but performance wise and emotionally. Perhaps I was so struck by the movie because I went in without having read any reviews, and I knew only little of the plot. So I went in without a biased opinion, and with an open mind, and was treated to the nicest movie I've caught since Lord of the Rings.
 Leonardo Dicaprio brings in his best performance here, in my opinion. He was a little off at first, but as the story delved more into his character, I believed him to be Frank Abagnale. With this being a true story, I was in awe at how much Frank actually got a way with. Sure, the movie may have exagerrated, but the situations Frank put himself into and got himself out of were absolutely crazy. Also how Dicaprio showed Frank's descent from fully confident in his dealings to being on the run and in fear from Tom Hanks' character Carl Hanratty was priceless. Speaking of Tom Hanks, he's so awesome. I've always liked him, but this movie made him high on my list of top actors. His subtle one liners were great, and the Knock Knock joke has become classic to me. A surprise to me was Christopher Walken. I'm used to seeing him play the villian or a devious character, but here he showed heart and range. Great actor. Another nice addition was Amy Adams.
 Everyone knows this, but Steven Spielberg is a directing genuis. He makes setting the tone for any type of feeling seem so easy. I'd feel like I was making an understatement if I said ""Great directing.""
 I'm continually saying good things about Catch Me If You Can, and it's because I honestly can't think of a bad thing. Even with its over two hours play, I can find no complaint.

1478085,4,B00005JLSB,"Wow, Spielberg was a busy little man this year. After Saving Private Ryan, Steven took a nice long three year break. When he returned with an enjoyable, but stereotypical sci-fi drama - A.I. Artificial Intellegence - life wasn't too good for him, as the film flopped at the box office. Well, now this year Spielberg came out with two very satisfying films: Minority Report and Catch Me If You Can. While Catch Me If You Can isn't as good as Minority Report (I like sci-fi movies more than comedy), it still was a breakthrough for Spielberg. All of Steven's previous comedies have either flopped at the box office or recieved very negative reviews by critics (1941 and Hook. I actually enjoyed Hook though). Well now, he goes back to comedy in a more serious way. I just enjoy seeing Tom Hanks act so [mixed]up and I get a kick out of his Boston accent. I'm not a big DiCaprio fan, in fact I usually hate his gut. But in Catch Me, he was excellent. I loved the part when he pretends to be a substitute teacher, it's just so funny. All of the actors seem to enjoy their roles, and that's a good thing. I do tend on getting the two-disc DVD when it comes out in May. The only flaw in the movie is that it can drag on some of the slower scenes sometimes. Other than that, the movie is excellent. And must I not forget John Williams' classical 50's style score. I highly recommend it.",1046649600,3,1379,4.348837209302325
1478219,5,B00005JLSB,"""Catch me if you can"" is, maybe, Spielberg's first movie not featuring any special effects since Duel. That's good, because the viewer can concentrate in the actors' performance. And that's this movie's main feature.
The story, as everyone may already know, is about Frank W. Abagnale Jr., who left home as a sixteen-year-old and became one of the most successful criminal of all times. What is most interesting, Abagnale was an intelligent felon, his crimes were related to fraudulent checks, identities, etc; he didn't have to murder or kidnapp anyone to be part of FBI's top 10 wanted list.
Abagnale Jr is played by Leonardo diCaprio, acting in a very loose and comfortable way, at times serious, at other times charming, according to the script. Tom Hanks proves his capacity at playing another different character: Carl Hanratty is boring, fatty, charmless, lonely and yet you like him anyway. The duo's relationship is very well portraied in screen. Another good thing is that Christopher Walken's back to a good role as Leonardo diCaprio's father.
This is nice entertainment, and the best part is that it was reportedly an easy and fast film to make, and based on a true story. There are some obvious fictious parts in the movie, but that's for script's sake, so it doesn't ruin the story.

The story is simple- After his parent's divorce,  DiCaprio decides to leave the household and set up on his own.  With no money, he soon resorts to scams, most notably using counterfeit cheques.  This story is a game of cat and mouse between Hanks and DiCaprio.  DiCaprio poses as many different faces including policemen and pilots.  However, the tension that builds up in where Hanks is getting closer to DiCaprio soon fades.
What we are left with in the end is a film which proves to be long and, in the end, begins to get tedious.  Had Catch Me If You Can been shorter, perhaps it could have proved more enjoyable.

In this he is still clearly a teenager of divorced parents trying but failing to come to grips with that reality.

That movie represented the ""new"" Spielberg, the director whose view of the world has become much more dark and sinister. Yet, in that film there were hints of the comedy and dark humor that were reminiscent of the ""old"" family friendly Spielberg. Spielberg's other film of 2002 is CATCH ME IF YOU CAN and it's a classic Spielberg piece in every way.

The movie is warm, light-hearted, and full of nostalgia. That is ironic in a way considering the movie is based upon the crime spree of the world's most successful con artist, Frank Abagdale. Of course, if you've read Frank's memoir of the same name, you know that's how the book is too. Therefore, the film stays true to the spirit of the book, messing with history just enough to make the movie more compelling, dramatic, and lively.

The whole look of the film; from the cars, clothing, hairstyles, and Christmas ornaments; captures the style and era of the mid-1960's. The soundtrack is great and the movie's main theme is another tune that makes a nice addition to the John Williams canon.

Every performance Tom Hanks has done since SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE has been golden and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is no exception. Leonardo DiCaprio does a wonderful job as the main character and Christopher Walken pulls off a supporting performance that should earn him an Oscar nomination.

Frank Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a bright kid from a middle-class home who becomes an accomplished cheat before his 17th birthday by palming himself as an airline pilot,a doctor and even an attorney and by paying bills with his counterfeit checks.
He steals almost $4 Million in the whole world while his father (Christopher Walken) gets in trouble with the taxman and has to sell everything,ending up working for the Post Office. And while his mother (Nathalie Baye),who had an affair with one of her husband's rich friends before,which led to the divorce,marries her new boyfriend.
FBI agent Carl Hanratty(Tom Hanks) tries grimly to catch Frank who rings him every Christmas Eve to ask about his estranged daughter and wishes him well.
One Christmas, Carl catches Frank in France,but does the story end there?
Steven Spielberg chose some brilliant actors for his film who bring a lot of quip and als seriousness into this true story of Frank W. Abagnale.
It is a very good film and Leonardo DiCaprio convinces the audience in his role as an 16 year old cheat,just like Tom Hanks as a subborn FBI agent.",1044576000,3,1254,4.864485981308412

Is this a great country or what?
Stephen Spielberg's CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), who conned his way to outrageous fortune before he was even old enough to buy a beer.  The Abagnale family is on the cusp of implosion, and when his parents finally split, do does Frank, Jr.  As a 16-year-old living on his own, he quickly learns one thing:  as long as you can write a check, you can survive another day.
DiCaprio at last sheds his bubblegum ""Titanic"" image and turns in an impressive performance.  He shows some remarkable range in a role that is fundamentally and inherently complex.  Tom Hanks is solid as FBI Agent Carl Hanratty, who stubbornly and relentlessly pursues Abagnale from one con to the next.  But it is Christopher Walken as Frank, Sr. who steals the show; Walken effectively portrays the senior Abagnale as a shrewd, yet vulnerable businessman overwhelmed with financial troubles--a con man himself who is pleased with his son's daring duplicity.
I would have liked for the film to dive deeper into the ingenious machinations of Frank, Jr's check forging ability, and the Sixties Retro opening credits are so annoying I almost walked out then and there.

Indeed Leo did a very good job in Catch Me If You Can. Co-starring with Tom Hanks, whose acting is nearly unquestionable; Leo's performance is no second grade to Tom. Telling the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., a 16 year old school boy turned fraud cheque expert, Leonardo has captured the essence of the character who show gradual psychological changes with huge dilemma inside: on one hand he needs to survive in the cruel material world and on the other hand he doesn't want to be hunted down as a criminal. He took up different fake roles as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, which all requires strict standard of accreditation without being questioned. However, he who scored all these successes was not happy with his life. He tried to confess to his father-in-law to be but was not taken seriously. It is sometimes interesting that people would prefer to believe in lies instead of the truth. The problem is where is the truth for this tragic character now? Also where could he position himself in the world while he believes there is nobody to trust anymore? His father is far from being able to help, while his mother is already occupied with a new family, he seemed to be alone and on the run by himself. Strangely enough, Tom Hanks, who was the agent to catch him for his deeds become his only soul mate that he could call on Christmas Eves. The tie between these characters are interesting in a way that both saw something inside each other, but because of the difference in position that they could not let each other have a minute of rest. This is a very touching story delivered by two really really good actors who brought these two real characters back to life again in front of the audience. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is way back on track and Tom Hanks' attention to details in character building is just shockingly good.

Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank, who runs away from home when his parents are going to get divorced, and poses as a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and other praiseworthy professions in order to pass phony checks and win the hearts of girls everywhere.  Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent out to catch Frank.  The story is great, the acting is superb (Hanks's Boston accent is hilarious), and the jokes are great.

1478309,4,B00005JLSB,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is the dramatization of the semi-true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., a man who, during the 1960s, managed to con his way from woman to woman, and locale to locale. Abagnale lived his life of deceit all before the age of 20. There have been some liberties taken with the story (isn't that always the case with film?), but you get the overall picture of what his life was like at the time. It makes for an interesting, engaging movie. This will not be a deep, meaningful 2 hours you spend, watching this film, but it will be enjoyable.
Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale Jr., a teenager living at home with his mother and father, living what seems to be, by all intents and purposes, a 'normal' life. Then we begin to see the layers of the family's life come apart and unravel. Frank Sr., played with subtle depth by Christopher Walken, is being hounded by the IRS. He has lost all of the family's money. Then, the mother sees fit to find her comfort elsewhere, if you know what I mean. The family falls apart. Frank Jr., unable to handle this, runs away. And thus begins the main thrust of ""Catch Me If You Can"".
Frank Jr.'s role model growing up was his father, who we can infer from his IRS troubles wasn't the most proper businessman on the face of the planet. Frank Jr. follows in his footsteps. He runs the gamut, from check forgery to false identities. The junior Frank criss-crosses the nation, finding a woman in every city, and prosperity at every turn (all through deceit, of course). FBI agent Carl Hanratty, played with hilarious deadpan by Tom Hanks, is constantly on Abagnale's trail, but always seems to be a step behind.
This doesn't feel like a Steven Spielberg movie and, though I hardly ever thought I'd be saying this, that is a good thing. At times, Spielberg's hand can be a tad heavy over the atmosphere of a film, and this particular tale needs to be let free to just simply tell its story. And it is. The movie flows effortlessly from scene-to-scene, plot point-to-plot point, and it's a good, smooth ride. Tom Hanks does the most perfect portrayal of a thick-rimmed glasses, stuffy personality 'suit' that you could hope for. Leonardo DiCaprio, though about ten years older than the part he plays, still looks boyishly handsome, and once again gives us a strong, confident performance. He just gets better with each role he undertakes, and he already started out as the best of his generation. Christopher Walken deserves accolades for his role as Frank Abagnale Sr. There are so many scenes where he simply simmers with complexity. One scene, in particular, filled me with so much sympathy for the character that I immediately thought 'he needs to get an Oscar nomination for this'.
""Catch Me If You Can"" won't change your life. It isn't some profound piece of film such as ""Schindler's List"", or ""Saving Private Ryan"". No, Spielberg has left that behind, for the moment, and instead has given us a solid, well-structured, appealing chase film that doesn't feel like a chase film. And the opening credits are some of the most creative I've seen in a long time - a fun blend of sixties jazz and cartoon frolic. John William's score is also excellent. There isn't much to *not* recommend about this film. Most enjoyable.",1043193600,13,3268,4.655709342560554

1478311,3,B00005JLSB,"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very charming film directed by Stephen Spielberg (ET-The Extraterrestrial, Minority Report). It is a period piece and the detail to costumes and set design is very interesting and accurate. It made me wonder how much was actually special effects and how much was real. It's got humor sprinkled throughout and when you see what the ending tells you - you'll walk out of the theatre in amazement.
The story is that of 16 year-old played by Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic, Gangs of New York) who cons his way into the airline business, medical field and in the Legal profession. His learns the scheming ways from his father who is brilliantly played by Christopher Walkin (The Dead Zone, America's Sweethearts).
Now, the FBI catches on to forged checks and sees a pattern develop and then assigns Tom Hanks (Apollo 13, Castaway, Splash) to try and track him down and incarcerate him
Spielberg directed this one with a little flair and a lot of attention to detail. It has humorous moments and a lot of interesting facets on the FBI, their procedures and what a clever boy can really do.
As a result of his worldly travels he ends up falling in love and the kicker of it all is the ending when you read the text on the screen that tells you what happened to these two men and what their doping today. I liked this movie - although a little long in length - it was much better than AI. This one is one I think the whole family can enjoy - if you can wait the length of the movie.

1478312,4,B00005JLSB,"December is typically the time of year that movie studios release all of their 'serious' movies just in time to be considered for Oscar nominations.  While this invariably leads to wealth of excellent films to see, most of them are exactly 'fun' to watch.  ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a welcome break from the dour natures of the films this time of year and is a very entertaining viewing experience.  In fact, if it were not for the Academy of Motion Pictures disdain for comedies and multi-genre films (this would qualify is a 'dramedy'), ""Catch Me..."" might have a shot at a few Oscars, too.

  ""Catch Me If You Can"" tells the real-life story of one of the most unlikely, accomplished con artists in U.S. History, Frank Abagnale Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio).  Abagnale was responsible for impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, an assistant attorney general, a history professor, and forging $2.5 million in counterfeit checks.  The real kicker is that he did all this before he even reached the age of 18!  Ironically, Abagnale currently is one of the most sought after experts by banks and business when it comes to check fraud and developing methods to guard against it.  Although there are likely some embellishments to enhance the dramatic value of this movie, ""Catch Me..."" by and large sticks closely to facts of the story.

  In the movie, Abagnale (DiCaprio) first realizes his gift for the con when, at a new school, he takes advantage of a substitute teacher's tardiness and impersonates being a teacher, himself.  It's not important that he didn't have that much greater knowledge over the class material than they other students.  What was important was that he had the charisma and charm to make the rest of the class think he did.  A key scene early in the movie takes place when Abagnale's parents are called to the principal's office because the school found out about Frank's scam.  Instead of coming down hard on Frank, his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (played with understated grace by Christopher Walken), jokes with his son about it and almost seems proud of it.  Frank Sr., unfortunately, is one of those lost souls in life, who seems to have the perfect American family, but is really more of a loser who is watching all he worked for come unraveled (a failing business and a failing marriage).  Frank Sr. seems proud of Frank Jr. because the younger has the ability to actually pull off the scams that the older tries and fails to do.  It's a very telling moment, because it foreshadows the motivation for the path in life Frank Jr. would take because Frank Sr. chose to be a cheerleader rather than a father.

  After his parents divorce, Frank Jr. decides to run away and use his 'skill' to make a living.  This is where ""Catch Me..."" takes the audience on a long journey through the various professions and scams of Abagnale's mentioned above.  To be able to fund his 'adventures', Frank uses his intelligence and charm to discover all manner of ways to get false checks cashed.  As he becomes more adept at this task, he also attracts the attention of FBI Check Fraud division and agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  Abagnale begins to move across the country and pick up new professions while managing to stay one step ahead of, but still in contact with, agent Hanratty.  The irony of Hanratty's pursuit of Abagnale is that Hanratty understands Frank better than Frank does, at least in terms why he is doing these scams.  In trying to stop Frank and help him rehabilitate himself, Hanratty becomes the father figure that Frank Sr. never was.

  ""Catch Me If You Can"" is simply one of those funs movies that make the movie going experience worthwhile.  Hanks plays agent Hanratty well as somewhat clumsy, stodgy, and determined pursuer.  Walken gives what could (and should) be an award-winning performance as Frank Sr.  The true pleasant surprise here, though, is Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Frank Jr.  After years of self-important behavior and an almost total disappearance from big screen in the aftermath of ""Titanic's"" massive hype machine, it's nice to see DiCaprio back as a likable character in a good role.  He has probably learned his lessons about what fame can do and, combined with his role in ""Gangs of New York"", has likely signaled a return to the successful acting career many people expected of him from his earliest days.  In concert with the other fine performances, DiCaprio helps make ""Catch Me If You Can"" a cinematic treat.",1043193600,2,4490,4.798177083333333

All the while he's pursued by a dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty ), whose dogged determination stays one step behind Abagnale's spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn in enjoyable performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it zipping along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please his father. In my oppinion, this is a must see for anyone that has good taste. ...if I were you I'd get out there and see this movie as soon as possible.",1043193600,,860,4.74
1478314,4,B00005JLSB,"It's nice to have a Spielberg movie that doesn't have to be loaded with portent. Don't get me wrong, I like portent, but I went to this expecting escapism (based on the trailers) and I got it in spades! I was immediately caught up in the movie and enchanted by the light story. The characters were all likable. The period details really great (check out DiCaprio's Bachelor pad when he's pretending to be a doctor). Even the John William's score works nicely for a change. Everyone is working in the same light-hearted vein, and the tone is very nice and consistent throughout.
DiCaprio is very charming and believable, and in his few serious scenes, he brings some real pain to the proceedings. I hope this and Gangs of New York helps us remember that he actually was (and is) a good actor, and not just that obnoxious playboy from the post-Titanic days. Tom Hanks is great: we root for him to catch DiCaprio, and we root for DiCaprio not to get caught. That's part of the fun! And Christopher Walken really gives one of his best performances in a long time. He's the most ""serious"" character in the film, but he shows terrific heart and spirit, and only occasionally falls back to his ""creepy"" mannerisms.
This is not a serious work. It is meant to lighten your mood with a competent, straightforward telling of a truly engaging story. And it succeeds. I say ""catch it if you can.""
REGARDING OTHER REVIEWS I'VE SEEN SAYING THE MOVIE ISN'T FUNNY AND AUDIENCES AREN'T LAUGHING:  The audience I saw this movie with was in stiches.

1478315,5,B00005JLSB,"Leo turns in a super fun and super poignant performance as 16 year old Frank Abagnale, Jr. (note the Jr.--he is very proud of his dad!). He is a little boy lost who makes the best of things when his father (Christopher Walken, in one of his typically quirky and unique performances...is that guy crazy or what???)--the only hero he has--goes under finacially and emotionally. Walken is forced into giving up his house, business, and French war trophy chippy of a wife in one fell swoop all because of ""the damn IRS--they are after me all the time!"" he claims.
The truth is, he overstretched himself, probably because his immigrant wife wanted a nice house, a Cadillac, all those things that Americans wanted in the post WWII years.
When their little American dream is shattered, Leo has to choose between parents when the divorce papers are being signed. Unwilling to do this because he loves them both, he gets up and runs out of the house at the tender age of 16.  Making the best of things out on the street, he uses his wits to carve out a new life for himself, embellishing the con games his father taught him, bumping them up to a way larger scale. Vastly intelligent, he is able to figure out how to impersonate a pilot, a James Bondian glamor type with a ""little silver sports car"", a pediatrician and a lawyer all before the age of 19.
He does it for the money, but more than that..he does it for his beloved, failing in health, ne'er do well, but good hearted dad. He is immature enough, for all his con man ways, to think that money can put his family back together again.  He wants his dad to get his mother back, so they can all return to the way things were.  In the long run, it turns out he is just a kid, a devoted son, who idolizes his father through thick and thin.
So that is what drives Frank(Leo).
What drives Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks, who generously ""gives"" the movie to Leo, which does them both a service in this case), the FBI agent who relentlessly and unglamorously pursues Frank throughout his conman career? Carl is driven by the emptiness at the core of his life, too.  His family is broken, just like Leo's. The two make quite a pair. Their relationship is understandable, and touching, as you will see.  All anyone wants is a little love I guess, and someone to come home to.

1478317,5,B00005JLSB,"""Catch Me if You Can"" is a smart and occasionally funny film that shows you that sometimes the most outrageous stories are the ones that are true.  Yes, this was inspired by a true story.  How close to the facts it stayed is unknown to me, but what is known is that this was a film that kept me intrigued and in awe from start to finish.
Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale Jr.; a young and bright kid who can con with the best of them.  How he got there is that he has learned from the best, his father.  Things get shaky when his parents are undergoing investigations from the IRS and his mother wants to get a divorce.  Not knowing what else to do, Frank runs away and tries his best to make it on his own by doing what he does best: con.  Posing in many different occupations such as an airline co-pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer triggers a cat/mouse chase conducted by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks).  The movie keeps your attention throughout and leaves you unsure of what's going to happen next.
I loved everything about this movie.  It was ten times better than I thought it would've been, mainly because the trailers do mislead you (as many have said) into thinking that you're going to be seeing a whacky chase comedy with all sorts of shenanigans and mishaps.  Well, yes it is a funny movie at times, but I don't think I would really label it as a comedy.  A lot of the things that happen in the film are actually heartbreaking and sad.  So be aware of that when you decide to buy a ticket for this one.
The performances were more than ingenious.  Tom Hanks is as great as ever and really takes his role to the limit while DiCaprio also proves to be a fabulous actor as well, and also is able to show us there is life after ""Titanic.""  Everybody else was really great in the film, especially the great Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. (your eyes never leave his sight when he's on the screen).
Stephen Spielberg does an outstanding job of orchestrating this wildly unpredictable film.  It doesn't always have to be sci-fi this or aliens-that when it comes to his films.  He's able to expose the heart of the story with ease in this film, not cheating us out of anything at any point during the entire movie.  I wished he'd do more films like these because he's really good at it.  Although I do love some of sci-fi films like ""Minority Report,"" I think his more realistic films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"" is when you get to see his true and unique talent at its absolute best.
""Catch Me if You Can"" was a pleasant surprise for me.  I did not plan on liking it as much as I did, which in itself is a pretty neat quality of the film.  Just remember that this isn't supposed to be a ""dead-on"" comedy.  There are funny and amusing moments, but some of the things you will see are actually sad in some cases.  Still, this is a very well-made movie with top notch performances that definitely deserve recognition.  Very worth your time.",1042934400,,2974,4.369090909090909
1478425,5,B00005JLSB,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on the true story of former con artist, Frank Abagnale Jr., directed by Steven Speilberg.
PLOT SUMMARY: In ""Catch Me..."", Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Frank Abagnale Jr., a teenager of the 60's who's life abruptly changes when his parents (played by Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye), get a divorce. His father was being investigated by the FBI, and Frank, not wanting to have to choose between living with his mother or father, took off. Now on the run, Frank needed money. He had no previous job experience or college education. So what did he do? He changed his name, forged checks, and disgused himself as a co-pilot for a Pan Am jet, became a lawyer, and a doctor--all without licenses! After investing over $2.5 million, he eventually got the FBI's attention...one particular FBI agent however, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), did and risked everything to catch Frank and put him to justice.
MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: ""Catch Me If You Can"" was clever, witty, and a quirky film. It was fast-paced with excellent, Oscar-worthy performances delivered (especially by DiCaprio and Hanks--who, by the way, made a terrific dueo team) by the entire cast. The screenplay, written by Jeff Nathanson, was wonderful. The humor is solid, though I don't really know if it is actually a ""full-fledge comedy""...you probably won't be laughing all the way through. Steven Speilberg has yet to disappoint me with his work. With each and every film he does, he continues to impress and entertain me. Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life story is indeed extraodinary; what amazes me most is HOW he became the most successful con artist BEFORE he turned twenty-one years old. All of that is revealed in the film, which you must go and see by the way. All I can say is that I will definitely by the DVD when it comes out--hopefully, it will have some great bonus features, as Speilberg always remembers to add onto the DVDs of his films.
I highly recommend ""Catch Me If You Can"".

I have to admit that the film was kind of long (that is what you would expect from a Steven Spielberg film), but it really didn't matter just as long as the film was good, and man was it ever! The performances from Leonardo DiCaprio (""Titanic"") and 2-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks (""Cast Away"") just couldn't be better! The true-life story of ""Catch Me If You Can"" focuses on Frank Abagnale, Jr. (DiCaprio), a teen growing up outside of New York. His father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken in an outstanding performance) is being investigated by the IRS for maybe some back taxes and such. And the lives of Frank Jr., Frank Sr., and Frank's mother/Frank's wife, Paula (Nathalie Baye) take a turn for the worse. When Frank Jr. finds out that his whole life is in a bit of a shambles, he does the unthinkable...he embarks on a journey of impersonation and fraud by becoming a doctor, a lawyer, and an airline pilot. Not to mention that Frank has also cashed some fraudulent checks, in which the banks lost $4 million in the process...and he did it all before his 19th birthday. This case has attracted the attention of an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Hanks), who is determined to bring Frank to justice...if he can catch Frank first! The direction of Steven Spielberg was just as outstanding as when he directed ""Minority Report"" and the ""Indiana Jones"" films! The scenes in ""Catch Me If You Can"" were hilarious, especially the scenes when Leo's character outsmarts Hanks' character throughout the film, such as when Frank hires some ""stewardesses"" to escort him throughout the airport without being caught by Frank and his FBI boys. In conclusion, ""Catch Me If You Can"" has great performances from 2 celebrated actors, a great supporting cast (Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, Nathalie Baye, James Brolin, and Jennifer Garner), lots of humor, powerful storytelling, and a great soundtrack!

You will definitley leave the theater after this 2 hour + film very satisfied, with a smile on your face to boot. That is how incredibly enjoyable and fun this movie is. Right from the cool opening credits down to the last minute, it is nothing but a fun, entertaining ride for the viewing audience. Everybody knows that this is a true story based on the life experience of a real man, Frank William Abagnale, Jr. I haven't read the book, so I can't quite comment on how truthful it is, or what it leaves out. What a life. He was a 16 year old kid who was dealt with a upsetting blow in his family life, and it sent him on the run. If you haven't read the book, I won't say what causes this. Frank now finds himself on his own, with nowhere to go, and no one to do it with. Thus begins the cons. Frank becomes one of the best con men ever. He went on to impersonate an airline pilot(as Frank Taylor), and then a doctor(under the name Frank Connors), and then onto being a lawyer. He even took the bar exam and passed. In a few funny scenes, Frank is seeing watching tapes of ""Perry Mason"", ""Dr. Kildare"", and ""Dr. No"", all after taking on these new identities, to get a hang of just what exactly he is doing. All of this before he turned 19 years old. Hot on his trail is FBI agent Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks. The chase scenes between the two are extremely fun. How he slips away, which sets the cat and mouse game back in action, is great. Once caught, Frank is asked to work with the FBI helping out check fraud, under the supervision of Hanratty of course. This is unlike any Spielberg film I've seen. Different. All Frank wanted was a family. He loved his mother, but it seemed he had a closer, more loving bond with his father, Frank William Abagnale, Sr., who is played by the always fantastic Christopher Walken. The scenes they have together are all wonderful. Some of the best moments in the film. Frank wanted his parents. That's all. Once you get get past the fact of all the incredible things he has done, impersonated, and gotten away with, you start to remember that he is just a 16 year old kid, scared to death, and wanting a home, with a mother and father, to go too. This is what also makes his relationship with Hanratty so interesting too. He is chasing him. He's around. When he is caught and in Carl's care, it is apparent that Carl has been somewhat of a father figure to him. These two relationships with Frank and his father and Frank with Carl are very interesting to watch. The identities and all that are great fun, but it's these storylines that are fascinating to watch. The actors here are all great. Leonardo DiCaprio has proved that he is a great actor, and he is far more than just the king of world idol from ""Titanic"". For all the fronts he puts up, you see down deep that he is a scared young kid. He did a wonderful job. Tom Hanks shines too. But then again, when doesn't he?. Hanratty is a real man of course, and Tom makes it seem so on the screen. A harried man just trying to do his job. Walken is great as I've already said earlier. Martin Sheen also appears in a small role, as does James Brolin, and an uncredited Jennifer Garner from ""Alias"". John William's score is zippy and whimsical and it takes you right into the time. A nice piece of work. The film also looks amazing. They got great colors and the look and feel of the 60's down pat. It is a fantastic looking film. While it may appear to be light and shallow(Amazon's wrong)at first, you got to look beyond that and see what's really going on. This is something Spielberg has always been a master at.

1478433,4,B00005JLSB,"While I will admit up front that I have not yet seen this movie, There is one comment hat I would like to make with regards to its subject matter. With all the reviews, the commentary, and the advertising (it is a Spielberg film, after all), it seems that there has been one facet of this movie's genre left out of it, its predecessor.
I am speaking of a movie which is not a widely known film, but it can be said that at least the premise is not far from it. The film I am referring to is ""The Great Impostor"", starring Tony Curtis as the title character, and one that for its time showed much of the same premise as this one does.
For those who haven't seen the other movie, Tony Curtis plays Ferdinand Waldo Demarra (also a real life person), who from anearly age begins to develop his art for impersonating other people and professions. He criscrosses half the world, moving from the East Coast of the US to working aboard a Canadian hospital ship off Korea during the conflict. The two parts of that movie which I liked, aside from the ending of course, when Tony is allowed to break the rule about the fourth wall, were Karl Malden's performance as the family priest-turned-confidante to the younger and adult Demarra, and his time in Canada, where Demarra is able to not only appear more human, but actually allow the audience to see that side of him.",1041984000,,1358,4.414342629482071
1478434,4,B00005JLSB,"and the message is, ""Sometimes, I'm gonna do a film where I just try to entertain you"".  And entertain it did!

 Reviewers of the movie are at odds, either giving it high praise, when they recognize that it is just there to entertain the filmgoer, or calling it dreadful, when they expect every Spielberg movie to be a momentous event of special effects and storytelling. ""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on the life of a con man, who pulled his crimes as a teenager, and then reformed for the rest of a long life.  The story engrosses the watcher, and Spielberg gives the film a light touch, a terrific cast, and fits it all into the eerily real culture of the 60's everyday life with costumes (wardrobe is outstanding), period sets, and a general feeling of wonder (Remember ""The Wonder Years""?) that was the true 60's feel, devoid of momentous political events and the inevitable strife caused by war.

DiCaprio is featured as an odd duck, an obsessive compulsive trapped in escalating acts designed to make his father feel that his life is successful.  He shows some great naivete, especially in the scene criticized by many with Jennifer Garner, and displays the genial and engaging manner that the real Frank must have had to get away with what he did.

 Hanks is another believable work obsessive compulsive who chases him down and forms the nucleus of the nonviolent criminal teams that solve financial crimes in this country every day.  Bringing Frank to the FBI feels a little unbelievable, but it DID happen, and it was based on Hanratty's understanding and faith in not only the genius, but also the need of Abagnale to outsmart the world.  I'm sure it was a huge
financial success for law enforcement in the real world.

 Many seem surprised at the fine flair that Christopher Walken displays as Frank's father, but Walken's career is full of moments like these, where he has flashes of a true craftsman, then does an over the top performance in his next role...kind of a roller coaster ride with this fine performer, you never know what to expect.

 The audience clapped in the film I saw, enjoyed the music, had a great time...now that's entertainment!  Catch Me If You Can blends light comedy with a background edge of why things turn out the way they do when families dissolve.  It may be the most entertaining movie (short of My Big Fat Greek Wedding) of 2002; and although it doesn't deserve to win any awards....

sometimes Spielberg should just entertain us!  He's earned it.",1041984000,36,2494,4.694252873563219
1478546,5,B00005JLSB,"Steven Spielburg's second 2002 film is a dinosaur.  It's an anachronism.  It belongs to the time period in which it's set, a more innocent America where Charles Manson had not brought violence to the wealthy and Vietnam was still a winnable (and profitable) war.  It's Catch Me If You Can, the story of con man Frank Abagnale, Jr., who may very well be the world's foremost expert on forgery and fraud.  If that doesn't sound like a complimentary introduction, fear not; Catch Me a film's film and a throwback to the cinema of yore, when audio and video combined to make an experience rather than an assault on the senses.
Imagine a mixture of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and To Catch a Thief.  Catch Me has the slow pacing and careful cinematography of Hitchcock at his finest, and Spielburg has forsaken his recent effects-laden shots for straightforward storytelling.  Every individual shot is deliberately framed, with a care for detail not usually seen outside of a Lynch film.  There are no explosions to distract the eye from character interaction, and the overall effect is that of an effortless and immersive film.
Leonardo DiCaprio, in one of his best (and best-developed) roles since Gilbert Grape, plays Frank Abagnale, a teenager growing up outside of New York.  His father (played by Christopher Walken) is being investigated by the IRS, and Frank Jr.'s idyllic American life full of apple pie, WWII vets marrying their sweethearts, and large-finned cars is about to come crashing down.  When he finds that what he's left with isn't to his liking, Frank embarks on a career of impersonation and fraud.  He passes himself off as an airline pilot, a Harvard-educated doctor, an assistant prosecutor, and a recruiter for an airline stewardess program - all before his 19th birthday.  When he starts passing bad checks - to the tune of four million dollars - he attracts the attention of straightlaced FBI Agent Tom Hanks, who manages to avoid his Hanks persona in favor of actual acting.
Catch Me is a character story, told through a series of events in Abagnale's life.  It's funny at times, but the portrait that develops is of a sad, lonely, and almost pathetic child who runs and hides because he doesn't know what else to do.  Hanks is like an automaton, relentless in his pursuit, and his grip on Abagnale only grows tighter with each narrow escape.  It's not a deep meditation on a philosophical subject, or an artistic look at some overused postmodern clich.  Catch Me aims to entertain, nothing more, and succeeds admirably.
Without effects, a blazing soundtrack, and fast-paced action to drive the story, Spielburg ekes the most from Hanks and DiCaprio without resorting to hammy overacting.  This, combined with the easygoing plot and fantastic camerawork, lend Catch Me an unusual amount of verisimilitude for a modern film: it's something to lose yourself in, where you no longer think ""I'm watching a movie.""  That is an accomplishment worthy of note.

1478547,4,B00005JLSB,"Steven Spielberg's latest film, Catch Me if You Can, is his freshest in years after a stretch of good but flawed movies. This lighthearted comedy/drama is a little different style of film then his usual sci-fi or heavy drama fare, and the change seems to have revitalized him.
This true story, which sticks pretty close to fact, follows Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DeCaprio) in the 1960s as he fakes his way as an airline pilot, doctor and a lawyer while cashing thousands of forged checks. The story is hard to believe, despite its basis in fact, but Spielberg brings it very much down to earth and creates some very real characters. It is a very simple film in its nature, compared to most of Spielberg more complicated tastes, as of late. In fact, it hearkens back to his early films which displayed a more youthful vigor and passion. What he has always been best at is telling simple, magical tales about regular people getting caught up in extraordinary events, and that's what Catch Me if You Can is all about.
In fact, this film seems to revitalize everyone involved. Not only is Spielberg at his highest form, DeCaprio performs far better then anything he's ever done before. He shows some true talent portraying the genius kid. He manages to upstage the great Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, something I never would have guessed was possible. Spielberg must have seen the potential in him, and helped bring it to the forefront. Also, John Williams score is breathtakingly original. As of late, the great composer has delivered some stale music that sounds much like many other scores he's done (something that happens to everyone after being in the business as long as he), but Williams here shows that he's still got the talent to produce amazing new material. The authentic 60's sound of the music captures the tone of the film perfectly, and the unique opening sequence both looks and sounds like a period production. There are a few moments where the score begins to sound like some of his other work, but Williams seems to keep it under control and these moments are only fleeting.
This film is truly as near flawless as they come. Sure it isn't something that will have a profound effect on anyone; it won't change culture or demand viewing upon viewing. It's not that kind of film. It's just a simple, fun, entertaining story that is expertly produced and shows that Spielberg still has what it makes to make the classic movies of his career. Good job Spielberg, I knew you still had it in you.",1041811200,2,2513,4.713636363636364
1478548,5,B00005JLSB,"It's easy to see ""Catch Me if You Can"" as Spielberg Lite. Certainly it's ridiculous to compare it with such grave, portentous films as ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and it doesn't call for a fraction of the technical wizardry of ""E.T."" or the Indiana Jones flicks. Nevertheless, in its sprightly elegance and moments of unexpected poignancy, ""Catch Me if You Can"" is as fine a movie as Spielberg has ever made. The themes of home and belonging are crucial to Spielberg--""E.T. phone home"" could be the epigraph to his entire career. Beneath the cat-and-mouse game played by teenage con man Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) and FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is an intense longing on the part of both men for human connection, which they find unexpectedly in each other. Setting the action on successive Christmases was a master stroke, casting in bas relief the essential loneliness of both men. ""Catch Me if You Can"" would make a great double bill with Spielberg's first feature, ""The Sugarland Express,"" another film about an epic police chase and the need for home.  Of course you probably won't think about any of this while watching the movie; you'll be too busy laughing at DiCaprio's chutzpah and Machiavellian cleverness, and at Hanks' grumpy, Sad Sack attempts to trap him. The two leads, of course, are wonderful--DiCaprio in particular plays his role the way Yo-Yo Ma plays his cello--but the standout is Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr., shedding his usual creepy persona in a moving portrayal of a man whose essential optimism is slowly ground into the dirt. Frankly, the film could stand to lose about 15 minutes at the end, but it's built up so much good will up to that point that most audiences won't mind. My guess is that, in retrospectives 50 years from now, ""Catch Me if You Can"" will be considered among Spielberg's finest.",1041724800,5,1879,4.890282131661442
1478549,3,B00005JLSB,"I am not and have never been a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I must admit that he did a good job conveying the inner workings of the mind of Frank Abignale, who was started on the path to being ""The Great Pretender"" by a football-playing jerk as he went from his exclusive Prep school to a public school.  He very successfully posed as the substitute French teacher and, from all accounts, did a very good job at it until they caught him.  When his family broke up, he was on his own and living by his wits.  He did a great job of it, too, including passing the Louisiana State Bar Exam, especially considering his youth, which makes me assume his IQ was extremely high.
Tom Hanks is the Javert (or Lt. Gerard) to DiCaprio's Jean Valjean (or Richard Kimble), obsessed with capturing this fraud artist.  I thought he took it too seriously and, to be honest, I did not like him for about 3/4 of the movie.  Too many of the attempts to capture Abignale were pure overkill.  He had never been at all violent nor had physically harmed anyone, yet on several occasions hordes of armed men attempted (and failed) to capture him.  When he was finally incarcerated, no one took into account the total lack of violence that surrounded his career.
Of the supporting players, Christopher Walken was sympathetic, even pathetic, as Frank's father who cannot face reality and is the primary cause of Frank's life of crime.  I did not find Martin Sheen at all believable as Frank's fiancee's father.  My husband thought Frank's mother was a witch, but I found some sympathy for a woman married to a loser who refused to try to help himself so she made a new happier life, although I can't forgive her infidelity to her husband while they were still married.
This film is much more reminiscent of the television show The Pretender than of Les Miserables or The Fugitive.  Go with the right attitude, not expecting a Steven Spielberg masterpiece, and you'll enjoy yourself.  Expect too much, and you'll be disappointed!",1041724800,,2002,4.627118644067797
1478550,5,B00005JLSB,"While I looked forward to seeing this movie, I was surprised at just how well it was done. DiCaprio and Hanks both give very good performances, but what hit it out of the ballpark for me was capturing the mood of both the era and the chase.
Films and books have an interesting way of turning outlaws into charming folk heroes. This is one of those films that realistically bucks that notion. It shows the slick charm and finesse that Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio) used to sneak onto airlines and into prolific jobs, but it also shows the emotional destruction ---both his as well as his friends' and family's--- that comes with living on the run. Abagnale did live lavishly at times, but always had the anxiety of looking over his shoulder and keeping his stories straight.
We also see Abagnale grow up witnessing his father (Christopher Walken) attempting less successful scams, thus planting the seed for Jr's career.
We also get a nice overview of how bank criminals committed bank check fraud before the ""personal computer"" era, how such crooks were able to evade quick detection of the checks they forged, and how one person's charm versus another's gullible nature can be a deceptive weapon.
All in all, this film does a great job showing why even a successful con-artist is not so successful. This film humanizes the con-artist without making us feel pity for him. The lack of pity for the scammer is partly due to the character of Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who makes numerous personal sacrifices (including working in a department of the FBI that his peers judge as tedious). When you see Hanratty getting little thanks and dire frustration while playing by the rules, you want to see Frank Jr get busted.",1041552000,10,1717,4.784511784511785

However, what I found most intriguing about this movie was the depth of the relationship between Carl (Hanks) and Frank, as they realize that they have become more than just a cat and a mouse, or so to speak.

Since Spielberg's directing and the acting of Tom Hanks (who plays the FBI agent behind Abagnale's back) are both legendary already, I'd like to dedicate these lines to the lasting impression that DiCaprio left on me, with his versatility compared to his more dramatic performance in his other 2002 Christmas movie, ""Gangs of New York."" With this performance, he comes full circle, by encompassing the dramatic/romantic (""Titanic,"" ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Iron Mask""), the action (""Gangs of NY"") and the funny (""Catch Me..."") both in commercial, and not-so-commercial productions. His performance was very enjoyable: subtle, yet all-encompassing... like the smart intro titles of the movie. I am pretty sure you will enjoy this movie, for this, and for the cleverness of the whole concept, specially considering that it's based on a true life story.",1041465600,3,1203,5.206185567010309
1478553,4,B00005JLSB,"There is a definite sadness inherent in the story of Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the film made by Steven Spielberg of Abagnale's life as a con man. But it is a sadness tempered by exhilarating highs when Frank's cons work to his advantage.
DiCaprio plays Frank with all the notes necessary to convey both the sadness: check out his annual 12/24 calls to his nemesis FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) and the exhilarating highs: Frank methodically planning and executing a con.
Spielberg, in deciding to keep things ""light,"" misses out on making his film deeper and more probing especially since he pretty much avoids the psychology of what makes Frank Jr. tick. His one stab at explaining Frank is a scene with Frank's father (brilliantly played by a subdued Christopher Walken) in which Frank Sr. tries to con a Bank Loan Officer and has Frank Jr. help him out.
The Cons by themselves are fascinating...this is true. But how much more interesting they would have been if we knew more of Frank's motivations. Is it just the money? I don't think so.
The production is flawless, capturing the 1960's in all their grooviness: the space age looking airports, the avocado colored refrigerators and stoves, the neon colored shirts and peg leg pants.
""Catch Me if You Can"" is bright and fun and it's lingering sadness reminds me a lot of the TV series, ""The Fugitive"" with Tom Hanks playing Lt. Gerard to DiCaprio's Richard Kimble.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Abagnale, a young con artist who successfully masquerades as an airline pilot (among other professions) and passes off forged checks in the course of his travels. Tom Hanks portrays the nerdy but dedicated FBI agent who relentlessly pursues young Abagnale.
""Catch Me"" opens with a great, atmospheric animated sequence that is perfectly complemented by John Williams' score. The movie as a whole is an excellent blend of suspense, human drama, and laughs. Although the film deals with some very serious themes, the tone is largely light and fun. Abagnale conducts his scams during the 1960s and the film makes superb use of period music, film, clothing, and cars: it's great fun to look at and listen to.
The performances, script, and direction are first rate. The story is told in a very effective non-chronological fashion. DiCaprio shines in this lead role; he brings a nice mix of charm, brains, and boyish enthusiasm to the character. Hanks' likeable character is an excellent foil for DiCaprio's. Special mention should be made of Christopher Walken's witty yet touching performance as young Abagnale's father.

I'm not one of those psycho DICAPRIO TITANIC fans or anything, in my opinion, the real star of TITANIC was JAMES CAMERON.  But, from the trailers, it looked like a snappy, snazzy hip little movie with SPIELBERG in charge.  Come on, it can't miss.
I think it did though.
It's nothing like it's trailer.  From the trailer, I was expecting IN LIKE FLINT, THE PINK PANTHER, JAMES BOND... something quick witted, colorful and frantic, but instead it was slow.  It had some snazzy parts.  In fact, it had some really good parts, but I couldn't help thinking that this movie was more suited for a CBS sunday movie or LIFETIME NETWORK.
Before seeing the movie, I was expecting to see an OSCAR contendor or something.  After seeing the movie, I will be really disappointed if it is.  In fact, now I'm thinking CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND is the real TRUE STORY movie to see.
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a true story and it's an interesting story.  The acting is great.  I don't think anything different of DICAPRIO or HANKS.  They're both top notch performers.  In fact, if anybody deserves any acknowledgement in this movie, it's CHRIS WALKEN.  He's outstanding in it.  Maybe a best supporting actor here.
Although, the movie was a let down, should have just waited for it to come out on video.  A good movie, but not what I expected and not the kind of movie I wanted to see.",1041465600,4,1435,4.4653846153846155
1478622,4,B00005JLSB,"It's surprising that no filmmaker has told this story before -- it's an amazing one in so many ways!  It's a totally unique tale considering the age of the con man (a teenager), how much he got away with and how he actually did his cons, the extended pursuit by the FBI man, and much more.
The movie is full of amusing moments (fellow audience members were laughing at many points), but there's also a very human side as Frank the con man's motivations are explored.  The two lead actors in Catch Me are marvelous.  You have to believe Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank) as both a high school kid and a decade-older adult, and he carries it off well.  His convincing performance minimizes the ""how could anyone fall for it"" aspect of the cons.  (As in, ""how could anyone believe a 16 year-old is a doctor/airline pilot/lawyer?"")  Tom Hanks as the FBI agent is playing a kind of ornery character relatively different from the lovable or heroic people he usually portrays.  The development of the complex relationship between hunted and hunter is one of the movie's most interesting features, largely because of the skill of the two leads.
There are many visual touches throughout the movie that reveal we're in the hands of a master.  Clever camera angles, excellent period costumes, great sets, props and casting - everything comes together so well in Catch Me If You Can.

1478623,4,B00005JLSB,"This is a well directed, well acted movie from an excellent screenplay that tells the story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage ""con man"" who was finally captured after more than three years of posing as an airline pilot, doctor and lawyer while becoming a master check forger who undestood the intricacies of the banking system as well as did FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), the agent in charge of check fraud who pursued him. Obviously the reason Stephen Speilberg chose to make this movie was the challenge of keeping an audience entertained while telling an absolutely unbelievable story that only compells our attention because it is true.
Leonardo DiCaprio becomes Frank and convinces us of his ability to con others through his belief in himself, and Tom Hanks is Carl Hanratty, the man whose life is his job and who not only becomes Frank's shadow but eventual savior from a French prison (in the movie's opening scene). The supporting cast is very good as well - Amy Adams as Brenda, with whom Frank falls in love, Martin Sheen as her father who despite his belief in his worldliness is totally taken in by Frank, but most crucially, Christopher Walken who plays Frank, Sr. to perfection, a dysfunctional father and husband whose self deception and failed marriage cause the crisis that leads to Frank's decision to make a life for himself without the usual moorings of reality.
This is a story with many funny moments, but it is not a comedy. The movie begins near the story's conclusion to give us needed perspective, since otherwise it would seem even slower paced than it does at the beginning, which is one of its few faults. Then it concludes rapidly in a very interesting and somewhat unexpected manner except for those few moviegoers who may be familiar with the details of the story. However, when the film was over I felt that the audience's patience and understanding had been well rewarded; interestingly enough after more than two hours several people didn't rush out of the theater but sat there watching the credits and talking about the movie. In the end, to understand Frank's story, you had to understand his father, you had to understand Hanratty, you had to fully appreciate that Frank was really only a teenager, and the movie needed time to develop and integrate all these themes.

One of the main flaws with this film is its structure.  By starting the movie by showing us what is essentally the happy ending first (juvenile criminal Frank Abagnale all-grown up on the ""To Tell the Truth"" show, followed by a more-recent flashback being rescued by agent Handratty from a French prison), we can pretty much figure out the whole plot right at the outset, so the best director Spielberg can do for the remainder of a very long film is to distract us.  Granted this is done with superb acting and awesome photography of 1950's-60's scenery and costumes, but all it amounts to is a distraction nonetheless.
I found the repeated Christmas phone calls and outrageous coincedences simply too much to swallow.  Spielberg IS one of my favorite directors of all time, but even his most far-out sci-fi epic was written more believably than this.
There are glaring continuity problems in ""Catch Me..."" that have continued to sneak into SS's films starting with ""Artificial Intelligence"" when a character is shown in a perfectly dry, pressed shirt after rescuing his son from a swimming pool; and in ""Minority Report"" when the weather changes from a torrential rainstorm to a brilliantly sunny day in the next frame.  In ""Catch Me"" we have an absurd chasm between two Kitty Carlisle voice-overs in the opening scene, and later, a wine-stain on beige carpet moves very obviously between shots.  Come on, Steven, with all that dough and studio-backing, can't you hire someone with a pad and pencil to watch out for these bloopers?",1041379200,,1704,4.841924398625429
1478625,4,B00005JLSB,"Based on a true story, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN provides a congenial theater outing.
Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr., who, between the ages of 16 and 19, successfully impersonated an airline pilot, a physician, and a lawyer. In the process, he passed phony checks totaling millions of dollars. Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, the nerdy FBI agent out to bust young Frank.
This is probably the best acting performance by DiCaprio since TITANIC, which isn't saying much, and Hanks has done better. However, both actors apparently had a lot of fun with their roles here, and it's that energy that makes CATCH ME IF YOU CAN a film worth watching. Also, Christopher Walken is wonderful as the enigmatic Frank Abagnale, Sr., whose business and marriage is ruined by the IRS, which is pursuing him for reasons left largely unspecified. And, while it was never clear to me whether the Old Man clearly understood the extent of his son's mischief, the occasional sly grin and whisper in the ear seemed to indicate that he admired and envied his boy's larcenous spirit and adventurous lifestyle.
This film is a flight into nostalgia for those of us old enough to remember the days when commercial air travel still had lan, when pilots were heroes, and when the politically correct ""cabin attendants"" were elegant ""stewardesses"".  There's one comic scene involving Frank, Carl and an in-flight chocolate clair that pointedly recalls that coach fare used to be more than an apple and bagged peanuts.
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN drags a little by the end, and the lesson of the epilog might be that crime pays. However, it's a reminder that fact can be genuinely more entertaining than FX-laden fiction.",1041379200,15,1686,4.874564459930314
1478626,5,B00005JLSB,"Those are perhaps the best three words to describe what Catch Me If You Can is, but it's not limited to that.
When I first heard of this movie, I had low expectations to say the least.  The plot didn't seem like it was up to Spielberg standards, and at the time I didn't hold much respect for DiCaprio as an actor.  Of course, I was proven completely wrong.
This was the most entertaining movie I have seen all year.  Never for one single second did my eyes vear from the screen.  My thoughts did not wander for even a single moment.  I was mesmerized by Frank William Abagnale Jr.'s life's tale.  It is truly amazing.  Once you think that he can't top himself, he does.  I don't want to reveal anything about the ending (even though it's not one of those big ""surprise ending"" movies) because it is so much better if you don't know.  I guarantee you will be laughing out loud at the irony of the end.
But that won't be the only time you laugh - this movie is hilarious throughout!  From the beginning where he impersonates a substitute teacher on the spur of the moment (which ends up lasting a whole week, when he is caught he was in the middle of planning a field trip), to all the ways he eludes FBI Agent Carl Handratty, to the afore-mentioned ending.  It is sprinkled with so many jokes and gags that you will think it is a comedy...
...but there is also a serious dramatic edge.  The other main plotline that the movie revolves around is Frank's family.  When his parents divorce he is 16 years old, and that is when he runs off and starts his life of crime.  It is clear that this plays a key role in Frank's life.  Throughout his crimes, it becomes obvious he is trying to reclaim the loving life he had when his parents were still together.
Overall, Frank Abagnale's life is quite a ride.  I have to admit, I personally envy him a little.  He manages to live the high life as a criminal, and more than get away with it afterwards.  I thought that this movie was more consistantly entertaining than the OTHER blockbuster, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which is quite slow through the middle.  Catch Me If You Can was such an entertaining, fun, and hope-filled journey that not only can I easily see myself buying the DVD and watching it innumerable times, but I also plan on seeing it AGAIN this coming weekend.  This will be one of the very few occasions that I have seen a movie twice while it is still in the theaters, and that is saying quite a lot because most movies aren't even worth the cost to see once (Analyze That) let alone twice in the same week.
See this movie for a fun time, but expect to feel some heavy emotions.",1041292800,8,2645,4.305050505050505
1478627,4,B00005JLSB,"Let's face it: ""Catch Me if You Can"" is this year's ""Ocean's Eleven"". It's a fun movie made in a short amount of time by a director who's best known for his serious works in what feels like a side project. I mean, Steven Spielburg had just put out a brilliant blockbuster (""Minority Report"") last summer. Still, that doesn't stop ""Catch Me if You Can"" from being one of the most entertaining movies of the holiday season. From the gorgeous opening titles by Kuntzel + Deygas to the jazzy Mancini-style score by John Williams, everything about this movie is fun. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfectly cast as Frank Abagnale, Jr, the fast-talking con man who ends up robbing the United States out of $2.5 million. Same for Tom Hanks, who plays the role of Carl Hanratty, an obsessed bank fraud investigator for the FBI, who's thankful he finally has a good assignment on his hands...but soon realizes, he may be in over his head. The time of the season is explored as well, with Frank and Carl running into each other every Christmas Eve. Overall, a fun movie for anyone who'd love to see a simple picture without all the gloss and special effects of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"".",1041292800,,1181,4.601895734597156
1478628,1,B00005JLSB,"This movie was so much of a let-down from the book.  DiCrapio [stunk]-again.  Hanks was awful.  Worse accent/dialect than Costner's in 13 days (or however long that movie lasted.)  I usually enjoy Hanks (and Costner) but this was unbearable.  Sheen [stunk].  Walken was nothing like Abagnale's real father.  If you have high expectations, DO NOT READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU SEE THE FILM!!! So many cool tricks were left out that he really pulled in exchange for the lame ones done in the movie. ""To the moon"" and the awful ""mouse in whipped cream"" analogy drove me ape-youknowwhat!  Wait until it comes out on regular TV.  The book is a must have, but for lame brains who only see the movie, have at it.",1041206400,9,700,4.580645161290323
1478629,3,B00005JLSB,"I guess I expected much more from this film considering it was SPEILBERG after all. In short, the movie takes quite some time getting started i.e., the background on Frank Jr.'s family took up to an hour to establish.  The second half was more enjoyable, however, the movie was WAY TOO LONG!  At least 30 minutes could have been cut easily!  The scene with Jennifer Garner was a total waste of time and an insult to her talent.  That's all I have to say about that.",1041206400,2,465,4.372093023255814
1478630,4,B00005JLSB,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is one motion picture which asks one question in particular: If you were to toss a (bank or cashier's) check on the floor, would it bounce, or would it make a soft thud, and remain motionless afterward? As to the answer to the above two-part question, both aftermaths are correct...well...sort of. Although this is a motion picture which features a fine main and supporting cast (featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen in adequate roles), the film's plot seems to drag in certain places, making some scenes appear to be both drawn-out and boring (the ""thuds""). Overall, the main theme for the most part makes for an interesting teleplay between DiCaprio's and Walken's main characters (one of a number of ""bounces""). In this film, Walken portrays a ""freelancer"" named Frank Abagnale, Sr., who, in the past, was charged with tax evasion, leaving him in severe financial dire straits, amounting to a huge debt. His son Frank Jr. (DiCaprio) contrives on a scheme to cover his father's financial losses, so he cooks up a batch of fake identities, ranging from a doctor to a co-pilot (including everything in between) and writes several bad checks in the process (yet more ""bounces"". Get it? A virtual play on words!) FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (played by Tom Hanks) is assigned this case, and the wheels are set in motion. Agent Hanratty does everything in his power to attempt to catch this clever teenaged fugitive, but it seems as if he gets closer and closer to catching the forgerer, DiCaprio's character is criss-crossing the country. The few minor perks as to how the forgerer changes identities in this movie are quite amusing and hilarious (which I won't reveal for spoiler's sake), and these are essential to the film's main storyline, which makes ""Catch Me If You Can"" a mostly fluid and interesting movie, to say the least. However, due to the fact this is a two hour and twenty minute feature, means that some scenes appear to be tedious and tiresome, making the storyline hard to follow in certain places. But, Steven Spielberg should be given the utmost credit for making the directorial (and theatrical) aspect of this movie work. Despite some of the above minor inconveniences, this is a film that's definitely worth checking out, so be sure and ""catch it if you can"" (either at your local theater or soon to be released on VHS or DVD format) today!",1041120000,,2415,4.849878934624697
1478705,4,B00005JLSB,"Diet as in not as phat as his more recent films like ""Minority Report"", ""A. I."", and the revamp'd ""E T"". Don't get me wrong I liked this movie, notice the 4 stars. ""Minority Report"" was a phat movie, it was a movie to see on the BIG screen. It was mind blowing and just a cool futuristic flick with an intriguing story. This film had a good story, however less than mind blowing in most other departments. ""E T"" was a phat movie, it is one of the biggest movies ever. I never thought there needed to be additional footage dug up from 20 years ago, but hey that was cool. ""E T"" is BIG screen material. This movie is not likely to go down in history with Rudolph. ""A. I."" was phat as in just plain bloated. No additional comment on that film. This movie displays good performances, an interesting (""inspired by a true story"") story, and is well paced for the type of movie it is. If you haven't.. catch Leo while you can in ""GANGS OF NEW YORK"" it's epic Scorsese. Also Leo gives a fine performance in that film as well. So if you wanna kick back and take in a lite Spielberg movie with no artificial flavors, colors or intelligences for that matter.. ""CATCH ME IF YOU CAN"" is your ticket.",1041120000,,1186,4.229074889867841
1478706,4,B00005JLSB,"This film really is all about Leo.  It was interesting to see how Hanks doesn't really steal any scenes away or move the movie focus in his direction.  Leo is confident in this and truly plays a role that I think was just perfect for him.
As Frank Abagnale Jr., his relationship with the Sr. version is something that is very interesting to watch as this is being setup earlier in the movie.  This father-son duo are very close and it's great to watch.  The small exchage they have after the first time that Jr. get's in trouble at school give you a great smile b/c you feel that these two really do think alike.
The creative ways in which Jr. avoids trouble and the fbi is wonderful to see considering how quick-thinking Leo is in his ability to get his way out anything!
It's fast paced, doesn't linger on too much, but you don't feel like anything needs to be explained any more.  It's over 2 hours but it really doesn't feel like it.  A wonderful film for the holidays with a lesson learned and nothing but a smile on your face as you leave the theatre.",1041120000,,1057,4.313131313131313
1478707,4,B00005JLSB,"I didn't know what to expect when I ventured to this movie other than I'm not normally a big DiCaprio fan. I can say now that this stellar cast and producers have put forth a strong showing, that is, if you can last through the nearly three hours.
Pay attention so you don't get lost with the foreshadowing. I believe it is necessary to help set up the ending of the film but I think it was also longer than necessary. Without getting into details to spoil the story, I was impressed that it was based upon a real story and that the time period seemed to be somewhat authentic and not overly played, particularly with Southern locales.
I recommend the movie if you have around 3 hours to kill and enjoy a story about the ability to turn a sour life into one that is redeeming. There's a lot of psychology and sociology in the film that begs to be used as examples for discussion at the collegiate level. I can't wait for the DVD - it'll be added to my collection.",1041033600,,963,4.26775956284153

Martin Sheen's performance as the future father-in-law of ""Frank Conners, M.D."" is well done.  Fast paced and fun to watch, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is worth the evening admission price.

1478712,5,B00005JLSB,"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, the latest opus so far from the cinema's greatest living director Steven Spielberg, is a highly inventive crime caper movie based on real life.
Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Frank Abagnale, a kid from Long Island who ran away from a broken home and worked his way to riches by impersonating everyone from airline pilots to doctors to lawyers and forging checks to the tune of $4 million during a three-year spree in the 1960s.  Tom Hanks, reliable as always, portrays Carl Hanratty, the FBI man hot on his trail from coast to coast who eventually tracks him down in France.  The process by which DiCaprio is able to manage not only to forge checks but also his own identity is done with considerable wit and humor; and the cat-and-mouse game between him and Hanks closely resembles Hitchcock at his prime.
Spielberg obviously identified with Abagnale and his saga, since the director himself told some pretty tall tails in his youth to break into Hollywood, including lying about his age.  As a result, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, like a lot of Spielberg's work, has a deep personal resonance to it.  But Spielberg also devotes time to Hanks' FBI agent's dilligence in pursuing the elusive Abagnale.  The film's witty title sequence, made to look like the film itself was actually made in the early 1960s, and John Williams' jazzy score (in the manner of Henry Mancini's great film scores from the 60s), prove to be the icing on the cake.
Long and deliberately paced but never dull, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of the best films of 2002, and yet another great movie in the Spielberg canon.",1041033600,6,1599,4.656028368794326
