419346,5,630204135X,"To really comment on a film like Persona there would first have to be written full, a dictionary of completely new words and terms.  Verbal language simply cannot describe the emotional piano Persona plays.  Along with 2001: A Space odyssey, it is the single most disturbing and mind opening film I have ever seen.  While in the middle of performing the last act of Electra, Elizabeth Vogler suddenly freezes, and from then on ceases to speak.  She is in perfect health both mentally and physically, but for reasons unknown has simply retreated into herself.  Sister Alma, a young nurse, is sent to look after her.  They go together to a small remote Island, where Alma attempts to nurture her out of her silent facade.  At first, due to her silence, Alma cares for Elizabeth like an oversized doll.  But then, with the opportunity of real conversation, Elizabeth becomes to her an empty vessel into which she spills her soul.  And Elizabeth, hollow, becomes a sort of vampire, constantly taking in Alma, but at the same time giving herself up as well.  Nestled together, without the interferences of the world, their personas begin to mesh, as they become the two sides of a single personality, one soul living amongst two bodies.  However, as a human body warns off a foreign intruder, the personas of Elizabeth and Alma become allergic to each other, engaging in a fierce battle for identity.  Throughout, as if testing his own skills as a seducer, Bergman tries to remind his audience that it is just a movie they are watching, not experiencing.  But true to his form it becomes of no use... Persona is an experience.  Alluring, compelling, mind opening, and disturbing, Persona is all of these things.  It is a film that works on a multitude of complex levels.  In a sexual sense, not a stitch of clothing is removed, and yet the film permeates with eroticism.  It is on many stages completely surreal, but you don't realize that.  You don't realize anything... you simply experience.  And then afterwards you sit in awe, trying to recall what has just gone on.",987984000,6,2066,4.769014084507043
419347,5,630204135X,"God, where do you start?
For the young Bergman, it was a guy playing with a two-pronged hairpin that also looked like it had one prong. Well, he talks about this in 'After the Rehearsal' and again in Chapter 4 of the 'Magic Lantern', as it implies the illusion/magic of the reel (think ?The Face', whose silent performer-'hero' shares a surname with Elisabeth in this film)... and also the idea of conflation - the idea that characters in Bergman's films are not opposites but complements.  I mean, who else sees the squire not the knight as the true hero of the 'Seventh Seal', as he actually helps people instead of moaning?...  Or take 'The Silence', where the two sisters are so different but equally self-obsessed?...  Or indeed 'Persona'...
The two merging into one... The search/struggle for identity...
The VAMPIRE  la Dreyer  la - in turn - 'Seventh Seal'...
Psychology (the babies' hands - remember Bergman's obsession with his childhood) and the inadequacy of traditional psychological methods - cf. that smug summary at the end of 'World of Mariopnettes' or the SCRIPT of 'Persona'...
The religious/existential dilemma (the crucifiction - remember those harrowing shots in 'Seventh Seal' and 'Winter Light')...
The sheer aesthetic beauty of it all (the depoliticised Brechtian alienation effect)...
A life-changing film, anyone?",981072000,,1340,5.213953488372093
419348,5,630204135X,"""Persona"" is not only Bergman's masterpiece; it is consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made.  It is admittedly difficult, but never pointlessly so.  The underlying spirit feels much the same as the High Modernist literature of the 1920s: a brilliant fusion of emotion and intellect resulting in a startling new form of expression.  Indeed, the opening sequence of the film -- ""a heap of broken images"" -- brings ""The Waste Land"" to mind, and Bergman himself remarked, ""I had it in my head to make a poem, not in words but in images.""
Despite the unconventional style, one never has the feeling of novelty for the sake of mere effect.  The formal innovations follow from the content.  Much of the film, in fact, is shot in a fairly traditional way, though with Bergman's usual painstaking subtlety.  The detailing is even finer than one might expect, with every sound, almost every word, orchestrated with great care.
""Persona"" is a deeply compelling film, but it is probably not an ideal starting point for a newcomer to Bergman's work.  ""Wild Strawberries"" is more straightforward and warmer; a great character study that retains elements of fantasy.
A final note: Avoid the grungy transfer on Hen's Tooth Video.  The MGM version is far cleaner and is worth the extra money.",979948800,13,1293,4.89908256880734
419349,5,630204135X,"This is one of Bergman's most challenging psychological studies ever.  It asks (or rather inspires the viewer to ask) radical questions about personality, identity and character by presenting a woman who one day just stops living her life; stops talking, working or responding to others.  This rejection of both self and society poses a threat to others who don't know how to interpret what is going on and can't ask her directly.  Is your identity (""persona"") something you are--a personal soul or essence?  Is it something you choose to do (a series of actions)?  Is it a role forced on you by society and culture?  All Bergman fans should have a copy of this film.  It is at least as essential as *The Seventh Seal* and much more important than anything he did in the 70s and 80s.  Many of his films are about the silence or non-existence of God; but *Persona* dares to show us a world in which we are not even sure that people truly exist.",977788800,39,943,4.538461538461538

With it, the critical viewer can surpass content-based approaches to film and begin to understand the way film communicates visually.  Not only do I find the film valuable for my students, but myself as well.  I love to watch it and unravel its complex and compelling messages.  In approaching such a bold and innovative work, I find much of what I love in movies.  That experience is beautiful.

Unlike so many other great films (""Citizen Kane"" comes to mind) however, it is a difficult movie, one that works on so many different  levels that it is virtually impossible fully to appreciate it with a single  viewing.

419354,5,630204135X,"The first time I saw ""Persona"" as an eager college student many years ago, my reaction was ""huh?"" I have seen the film several dozen more times since then, and much of the mystery remains, revealing  another dimension with each viewing. Since Bergman's retirement and  subsequent autobiographical writings, John Lahr speculates that this film  is clearly about the two sides of Bergman's mother--and he makes a  convincing case.  Someone else here has posted that the film is really a  disection of schitzophrenia. I have made the argument in the past that the  movie is about...the movies.  The working title was  ""Cinematography,"" and Bergman has expressed this duality about  the role of the artist/filmmaker in the past and the trickery inherent in  the process of making and watching films. My point is that all the  above--and more--is true. Critic John Simon has stated that ""'Persona'  is to film what 'Ullyses' is to the novel."" Yep...at least.",931219200,16,953,5.070967741935484

The opening sequence  is far more original and artistic than most films of today which think they  are influenced by Bergman.  Along with being a startling intellectual  puzzle, this film also stands for many emotional problems and slips of  sincerity. The scene where the two women become one is reminiscent of the  bathing scene in a different but similarly harrowing work, The Plague, but  Camus.

419386,5,630204135X,"I'm a fan of Amazon reviews because you find regular people not in the critic business often writing more perceptive ideas about a book or film or whatever than a lot of critics do. I find that in the responses here to one of the greatest and most difficult mainstream movies ever made, Persona. I want to add a few elements. First, that most of Bergman's films are not hard to follow at all in terms of narration, as this one is. Second, that this is his response to the tradition of experimental film as it existed from the 40s to the 60s (and I guess no longer exists). Third, that as a director who had established himself on the international stage it took tremendous guts to make a film this obscure and intense, and he never quite did it again (though came close in Cries and Whispers).  As Bergman admitted, he was obsessed with reviews and basically wanted everybody to like his stuff, yet over and over he took tremendous chances, never more than with Persona. I taught this film for 25 years in a college class, partly because I wanted to understand it better myself. I'll never forget the first time I saw it, staggering out of a barn showing in the Berkshires with no idea what I'd seen, but a burning desire to comprehend it. Really, some people here have grasped it pretty well, some on a single viewing. I've seen it eight or ten times. Let me add a few things. First, Elizabeth's muteness is a fairly realistic portrait of a nervous breakdown. I had a mother-in-law who did the same thing, went limp. Second, the opening is what I call the ""mad montage."" It first of all tells us that this is a film, and you can put any piece of film together with any other. Second, the montage kind of makes us crazy in preparation for a film about two women breaking down each in her own way. Third, you can take in the movie from several angles: the psychological, as a study of breakdown and obsession and losing identity; as a study of art and artists: for Alma, Elizabeth as an actress is a kind of goddess, and she projects her own fantasies on her; third, it is a statement about film itself, at once a distortion and an illumination of reality: one of the central images, from the very first shot, is of illumination. As Picasso said, art is a lie that shows us the truth. In movies Persona is a demonstration that  truth. Among the most disturbing aspects of Persona is that this work of fiction includes things that are terribly true: the monk burning in Vietnam, the Jewish boy rounded up by the Gestapo. So there's another theme for you: what is the illuminating lie of art, and what is the truth? Plus, if you strip away all the masks, who are you? As a practical matter: the celebrated ""mirror scene"" near the end actually tells you what you need to know about Elizabeth, her desperate and failed attempt to escape from who she is, from all the lies.",1450915200,,2867,4.417769376181474
419387,5,630204135X,"Persona is a film by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman that features Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann..The film is difficult to characterize in simple terms, but it may be helpful to describe this complex film as being an exploration of identity that combines elements of drama, visual poetry, and modern psychology. This happens to be categorized as a postmodern lesbian romantic psychological mystery made during the 1960's.

The central story revolves around a young nurse named Alma and her patient, a well-known actress named Elisabet Vogler. Elisabet has stopped speaking, and the attending psychiatrist treats the actress by sending her to an isolated seaside cottage under Alma's care. There the nurse, who must do all the talking for both women, becomes a little enamored of the actress. One evening Alma tells Elisabet about some exhilarating sexual experiences she once had and their unpleasant aftermath. Soon after sharing this confidence, the nurse reads a letter Elisabet has written and is shocked to learn that the actress thinks of her as an amusing study. The relationship between the women becomes tense, and they wound each other. Then Alma has a long dream in which her identity merges with that of Elisabet, but when the nurse awakes, both women have apparently come to at least temporary terms with their psychological problems.

Bergman has come up with probably one of his most masterful films technically and in conception, but also one of his most difficult ones. This is subject to many interpretations wherein any of which provide deeply disturbing looks into the psyche of the characters or character. But overall,it is an artistic study of the rules of interplay between opposite, ill-equipped dominant and submissive characters, expresses universal ideas about human compatibility.

Bergman 'returned' to the film world after a self-imposed exile because he was upset that god had died without letting him knowing about it so he bought an island off the coast of sweden and 'withdrew' from the world.  we begged him to come back, and he did, with 'persona.'  he knew he had a 'fan base' itching to hear from him again and he needed to accept  responsibility for that.  his 'silence' was officially over with 'persona' and he wanted everyone to know he was back in town.  'persona' is full of all sorts of 'cinema vague' artsy fartsey alienation techniques but it's also a damn enjoyable movie.  bib and liv are great and bibi tells a long running story about a sexual encounter on a beach that sets your hair on end.  it looks great.  filmed on his 'private island,' Faro, where he would make all his movies from then on.",1425600000,4,937,4.369942196531792

The older woman, having seen that the younger was making the same mistakes she had, gave the younger one the benefit of her ultimately negative experience.  So, there was at least the possibility that the younger one might do things differently.

Other than the stunning cinematography, the acting is nothing short of perfect. Especially the nurse, who carries a great majority of the dialogue in the movie. She gives monologue after monologue showing off her powerful acting skills.

The toughest thing about the movie is trying to figure out some of the more abstract passages, like the opening montage of shots which includes an erect penis.

419426,5,630204135X,"Well, if I thought Orpheus was wacky, I sure wasn't ready for the complex juggernaut of Ingmar Bergmans Persona. This confounding yet hypnotic work brings together two very different women, puts them together in isolation, and very possibly unites them as one.

Often ambitious films like this, with complex ambitions yet lighter narrative, lose momentum as they chug along, while this one actually had (for me) a sour start that got all the more intriguing. The glow of a projector ignites the screen, and we witness disturbing images of violence and isolation accompanied by screeching, unnerving sounds. After a seizure-inducing titles sequence of fast cuts and pounding timpani, we are eased into a (seemingly) more typical narrative structure.

A young, somewhat naive nurse has been assigned the difficult assignment to care for an established actress who, despite all signs of healthiness, has mysteriously gone mute. It is soon decided that the two leave the hospital for some R&R at the head nurses summer home on the coast.

From here on, the plot unravels hypnotically while somehow believably. The nurse carries out all the conversation (duh) but builds a relationship with her patient, and eventually reveals some troubling past sins shed committed. She confesses such actions with no prodding or interrogation from her counterpart, with her projection of a friendship upon the actress as the real only momentum fueling her disturbing monologue.

As the film progresses, additional acts, both large and small, trigger more and more impassioned reactions from the nurse, seemingly on the brink of hysteria. The more she invests into this one-sided relationship the more desperate and anguished she grows.

In Persona's final moments, we hear cameras whirring as our point of view glides back to reveal the actress performing on a film set. My take on this is the projection an audience, or an obsessed fan, can place upon fictional works or even specific stars. Like the nurse with the actress, the relationship between the parties is truly a one-way road. The impact attained from such investment and interpretation is just what you put into it.

Granted, this is a reading from one murky viewing of this film; upon additional visits, or if different elements had stood out to me beyond that fateful shot of a camera, my take on Persona could have been a very different one. Like the nurse with the actress, though, there is so much meaning and depth to uncover within this film if you only search for yourself in the art.",1406073600,5,2535,5.052631578947368

419428,5,630204135X,"Ingmar Bergman loaded this one up with everything but the kitchen sink. I think this film is at its best when it is portraying the psychological phenomena of transference and projection.

But I don't think Bergman intended to explain any particular type of behavior in this. He simply intended to portray the mysteries of life and did not attempt to shed any light on any possible explanations.

This film reminds me so much of my reaction to something like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I have a two-hour explanation of what that film is ""about."" But I don't think this's what Kubrick is getting at. The film attempts to portray the mysteries of the universe and not explain them. (God, does anyone think that Kubrick is actually attempting to explain the meaning of the universe??)

I think Bergman is after the same thing in Persona. How could I believe, or how could anyone believe, that Bergman is attempting to explain the mysteries of human behavior?

Lastly, here's Bergman discussing the writing of his scripts: ""I wrote my films not really understanding what I'd written. Then I shot them, and they meant certain things to me. But what they meant - that I didn't really understand until afterwards. Long afterwards. If my relationships to my own products are so odd, it's because often when I'm writing and shooting a film I'm inside some sort of protective shell.

The documentary with Liv Ullman is very good. She describes her life with and without Bergman as well as her career separate from him. She Bergman had a tempestuous yet nurturing relationship that shaped both their lives. Ullman in old age is very touching in her reminisces but would appear to be a person with inner strength and joy and is very appealing.

The blu-ray transfer of Persona rivals that of The Seventh Seal, which I consider one of the best black-and-white HD transfers ever released on home video. Beautifully grainy and detailed, with perfect blacks and little or no fluctuation or damage that I could see. Such a visual film truly requires a pristine image, and Criterion have delivered. I believe it greatly enhances the viewing experience, even for those of us who have seen the film multiple times previously. It makes recent releases by other studios, such as Kino's dreadful Nostalghia blu-ray, look even worse.

How wonderful that Criterion chose to also include ""Liv & Ingmar"", an 85-minute documentary that explores Ullman and Bergman's difficult but clearly loving relationship over the years. I had almost given up hope on the film getting any US release at all, much less a Criterion release.

I know Criterion films can be expensive, but you are really getting 2 films here, plus the additional supplements and the rather long, thorough booklet that comes with it. More than justifies the MSRP. I do wish they would reduce the price on other films that are slim in the supplements department, like Smiles of a Summer Night.

419506,5,630204135X,"What remains to be said about this wondrous, haunting film? From its opening montage of dreamlike images, mixing the luminous with the nightmarish, it draws the viewer into the private yet universal world of the human psyche. The story is simplicity itself: actress Elizabeth Vogler has chosen to be mute, unwilling to speak another word, and nurse Alma has come to care for her on a lonely island. But that bare-boned storyline yields an astonishing richness & mystery for the enrapt viewer, who is drawn into these two lives & their nakedly intimate entanglement.

Or is it just one life?

Among the pleasures of this film are the ways it can be interpreted. Are Elizabeth & Alma two aspects of the same woman? Are they two women, each one lacking what the other possesses? Is this a sexual seduction in progress? Or is it something much deeper, reaching down to the very roots of individual being?

As to the sexual aspect, Bergman demonstrates how the imagination is the most erotic part of being human, as Alma relates a youthful sexual adventure to Elizabeth. All we hear are her words, all we see are the women's faces ... but this sequence remains one of the most vividly powerful scenes of intense sexuality ever put on the movie screen. What our minds see & make our bodies feel is so much more erotic than any mere, blatantly graphic image could hope to be.

Yet that's only one aspect of the film, and hardly its most revealing one. What interests Bergman even more is the complicated, infinitely intertwining knot that is human desire, longing, and despair, searching for some resolution or illumination. What he offers here is not so much a definite answer as it is immediate experience for the viewer, who is left to respond & pursue the same questions. It's a film that invites multiple viewings, both for those perpetual questions & for its sheer beauty, thanks to the breathtaking black-&-white cinematography. Bergman has long had the reputation of being an intellectual filmmaker; I often think his eye for stunning beauty & poetic composition is neglected because of it. The film is an aesthetic marvel as well as an intellectual one!

For some, of course, all of this is just pretentious gobbledygook posing as transcendent depth. Certainly it won't appeal to everyone. And I'm sure Bergman's solemn reputation is off-putting to some potential viewers as well. But if you can set that aside & simply give yourself over to the film, you're likely to find yourself enthralled with it before long. And it will stay with you afterwards. Most highly recommended!",1361577600,13,2579,4.8522727272727275
419507,5,630204135X,"Review - Persona

After pouring through what can only be described as some of the best films of all time - Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, and many more - I couldn't help but think ""is this it? Is this the best that almost a hundred years of cinema can offer?"" Not that there's anything wrong with the films I just listed - they're legitimate classics - but still, I couldn't shake the feeling that the art of film had the potential to be deeper and much more meaningful than the famous Hollywood offers that are constantly quoted and referenced.

With that need ever present in my head, I decided to explore the films of Ingmar Bergman. It's with a great deal of embarrassment that I admit that Persona is as of yet my first, and only, exposure to Bergman's work, but I feel it couldn't be a better introduction to the subtle brilliance of his filmmaking and philosophy.

Persona starts strangely - with random uncomfortable images flashing at rapid pace across the screen before we're shown a scene involving a dead woman and a half-nude prepubescent boy. It's almost as if Bergman designed this introduction to ward off those who lack the courage or the intelligence to see past the strange and the shocking to the real wisdom that lies beneath it. That, in fact, is what Persona as a whole becomes; a strange and sometimes disturbing voyage into the mind of two women, and how profoundly lost even the most normal among us can become when we delve too deeply into our own psyche.

This is when we meet our two players. Elizabet Vogler, an actress rendered mute by a psychosis, and her caregiver, Alma, a nurse who begins the film on the universal and  prototypical path to a mundane life; a uneventful career path, an unassuming fianc, and the promise of a future with equally unassuming children. After a short introduction, the two women find themselves in a seaside villa - Alma's superior feeling it would be for the benefit of Vogler's health. One at the villa, Alma begins to open up to the consistently mute Vogler and as she does so, we see her deteriorate into profound identity confusion and illusion.

I won't go into any more of the story, as there isn't much more to tell. And if I tried, it would merely sound confusing and bizarre to someone who has yet to experience the film. Suffice it to say, we're taken on a journey into Alma's psychology that becomes as frightening and as curiously warped as the images that first greeted us upon starting the film.

Bergman achieves this level of depth and sophisticated storytelling through mild yet subtly lewd exposition paired with an extremely well crafted visual presentation that heightens the overall tension and metaphorical nature of the film. Bergman seems to have a meaning behind every aspect of the film's visual landscape. From his shot selection, to framing, to choice of scenery and even clothing of our protagonists, everything is to give us further insight into the story that lies in front of us.

It takes true literary skill to achieve the level of execution that Bergman achieves in presenting his story, and more often than not, when a writer attempts to weave such a complex tale, they fall flat with shaky logic or an unfulfilling conclusion. Delightfully, Bergman manages to deftly avoid all of these pitfalls and conclude his narrative in a way that's both satisfying yet as compellingly vague and aloof as the rest of the film.

By the time the movie was over, I found that the question I had posed to myself at the beginning of this article had been answered; no, cinema doesn't end with Clasblanca or The Godfather. The Silence of the Lambs isn't the deepest we can delve into the madness of the mind. No, while it may not be as epic or as flashy (or even as technically good) as other, more well known movies, it does achieve something that sparingly few American movies have; it makes the most of its craft, it transcends mere entertainment, and meshes fiction and photography and acting into the singular art that we call film.

There's been a lot of movies made recently that are little more than love letters to cinema - Hugo, and The Artist to name a few - but if you really want to see a film that plays true tribute to its artform, Persona is the film for you.",1341187200,3,4268,4.633597883597884

David Lynch, or Fellini, or Kubrick or Godard. Now that I understand
that, it's easier for me to get excited by the earlier experimental

in some of Bergman's other early work. The themes are right out in the
open but there's much less literalness in the questions. The whole FILM

What is acting? What is film? What are the boundaries between people?

ultimately the kind of puzzle that art does best - it makes you ponder

The two lead performances by Bibi Anderson and Liv Ullmann are
extraordinary, and Sven Nykvist again creates a series of unforgettable
images (now with the wider palate that Bergman started towards in 'The
Silence' - more camera moves, more 'cinematic' angles.).

But the nexus of this film, isn't the acting or the photography (though
the film would fail miserably without both being great), this is a film
about the inside of the filmmaker's mind, and by extension the inside
of all of our minds as we fight to make sense of the lives we lead.

It also has the single most erotic scene where nothing physical happens
I've ever encountered. And it's that kind of paradox that 'Persona' is
all about. I know I will get more from repeated viewings. The film begs
for it.

Bergman was obviously very well versed in Transactional Analysis concepts & brings them to the scene as only he can.

The more I look at these scenes & their construction the more impressed I am. I haven't seen every Bergman film but this is definitely the cream of the crop in my estimation.

It's also sometimes boring and annoying as hell, which is part of the point.  Unlike his other celebrated films, this one doesn't try to seduce or impress you by being aggressively ""deep"" and Scandinavian.  There's genuine tedium, hatred and contempt here--and friendship and honesty--not self-conscious angst and pretentious symbolism.

Loved this film when I first saw it in college and still do, even though I can't watch most of Bergman's other ""greats"" anymore (Cries and Whispers, Fanny and Alexander, Seventh Seal, etc.), they're so serious and self-important (though I do still enjoy ""Wild Strawberries"").

And even if I was lost and confused at times, the tension remained so great throughout that I kept watching.

A few weaknesses, though, got under my skin.

Although the film was psychologically deep, I didn't feel the character of the actress totally added up, and I think the director intended this.  But personally this troubled me.  She was portrayed as both sane and insane at the same time in a way that I (as a therapist who worked with many people labeled with psychosis) didn't find believable.

The other thing that got to me was the sexual perversity.  I felt it was a bit overdone -- and unnecessary.  But again, maybe that's just my personal thing.  Maybe it really was intrinsic to the movie.",1297987200,2,1087,4.38
419569,5,630204135X,"PERSONA is one of Ingmar Bergman's best remembered films & one  that solidified his reputation as a leading post-World War II film director. It also loosely codified his basic approach: Very theatrical, intimate & psychological--with a dab of surrealism..

At the beginning of the film a psychiatric nurse is given the doctor's explanation of his patient's condition. We learn that she is an actress and that one night while she was playing ELEKTRA she suddenly froze. It was not stage fright, but rather the symptom of a deeply embeded conflict. It's interesting that the role of Elektra should be the catalyst for her neurosis as the play deals with the subject of family betrayal. Freud's theories of the Elektra Complex also factors in with its complex sexual & role dynamics.

Next we see the actress in her hospital room & the TV is on, but she does not react to it. Suddenly a news item shows a monk in Saigon setting himself on fire as a protest to the corrupt regime in power. The actress jumps up and flings herself against a wall in silent hysterics. I interpreted this to signify that her crisis was not just personal, but also the sensitive reaction of a woman highly attuned to her environment & society.

The nurse & her patient go to live in seclusion with the idea that this companionable relationship without any real committment & away from the collective negativity of society will enable the actress to heal & resumme her place in that same society. There are just two little problems: The patient IS an actress & the Nurse is a real person, not just a passive listener.

419570,5,630204135X,"Persona is not a story of two women, it is the story of one woman. At the start of the film, she is having a breakdown. At the end of the film, she is back together again, ready to return to the world. The woman--call her Vogler--is not ""everyman"" or ""everywoman."" She is Bergman's ideal of the creative personality, with its horror show of neuroticisms. Liv represents the inner woman. Liv is silent to the world, but she is the essence of what is expressed by Vogler as an actress. Bibi is the persona--the outer woman. Bibi is the mask that Vogler presents to the world, her mechanism for coping with reality. The analysis of Vogler that the psychologist provides is 100% Bergman, and ""on the nose."" The easiest way to dial into the movie is to focus on the scene in which the husband reappears. This is the only actual ""intrusion"" of the outside world into Vogler's healing process. In this scene, the husband doesn't see Liv. The inner woman is invisible to him. He only sees Bibi, the persona. That is because he only knows his wife through her mask. When the husband first appears, Bibi doesn't recognize him. This is because, as a result of the breakdown, the two halves of Vogler's personality have become dissociated. But in this scene,  Liv appears behind Bibi, raises Bibi's hand like a puppet, and places it on the husband, directing her exterior self to resume her role. And at that point, Bibi ""recognizes"" her husband, remembers her child, and steps into the role. Bergman intended that this scene would shatter the viewer's notion that the movie was about two women, because the scene is otherwise inscrutable. The portrait of the two women, with Liv in the background and Bibi in the foreground, with Liv arranging Bibi's hair (and about to sink her fangs into Bibi's neck), is emblematic of Vogler's psychological architecture.

If you start at the beginning, and view the film as the story of the reintegration of a woman who has had a mental breakdown, keeping Vogler's psychological architecture in mind, it will make sense. At the end, when the reintegration is complete, Bergman shows us one woman, with one face, split down the middle. In the last scene, there is only one woman who gets on the bus. We see Bibi, the persona, restored to her role as the external woman, and we get a glimpse of Liv, the inner woman, as she will emerge as an actress, now that Vogler is able to return to the world.

During the period that Bergman made Persona, he made two other films in which he used multiple characters to ""stand for"" a single personality.

The same boy is used in both films. Most of the film takes place in and around a beach-house on the windswept coast of Faro.

Bibi Andersson plays the chatty state carer whose perfectly adaptive nature leads to being sucked into her companion's showdown with negativity - so that she too is made to examine what, if anything, lies behind her own socially-ordained mask. There is one of the most erotic scenes in film as Alma recounts an encounter she and her friend have with two young men while they lie naked on a beach.

This film speaks to me.

The plot is simple (at least on the outset).  Elisabeth Vogler is an actress who, for no apparent reason, decided partway through a performance to remain silent and she has been hospitalized because of it.  Alma, a young and nave nurse, has been commissioned to care for her.  The two women are relocated to a small seaside house where Alma will attempt to break Elisabeth of her muted condition.  When alone though, these two women begin to clash.  Mentally they start to break one another down, frustrated and impatient and stubborn they start to attack one another (especially Alma as her frailty starts to unravel).

The film is not given a clear conclusion, but that doesn't take anything away from you've experienced.  It actually helps to watch the film multiple times, for it is with each viewing that one can dissect and uncover the core of this very poignant and powerful expos&eacute; on human mentality and illness.

With brash directorial touches, Bergman blurs the lines between character developments to expose a truth we strain to see.

Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann are flawless here.  This is Andersson's movie, despite this being Elisabeth's story.  As Alma, Andersson carries the bulk of the films dialog, and she handles each scene rather effortlessly.  Even when discussing weighty subjects (her erotic encounter is just brilliant) she has this natural tone, an ease that helps establish her remarkable comfort with Elisabeth.  Although silent, Liv really transcends that silence and delivers a very moving performance.  Bergman always pushed his actors to deliver with minor facial movements to really convey feelings and emotions that were not dependant on words.  Liv's dynamic performance is proof of that.

If you are willing to climb inside your mind and explore what may not be most comfortable, then `Persona' is a film for you.  With startling images (the opening scenes are rather abrasive and shocking) and a subtle yet complex plot, `Persona' has everything a film needs to make an impact.

And what an impact it makes!",1260835200,,2354,5.028423772609819
419573,5,630204135X,"""Persona"" (1966) is a film about many things on many levels. It can be seen an experimental deconstructivist film, or as a film about identity and nothingness, or as a film with any number of other themes. Actress Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann) has a breakdown, and after a short stint in the hospital she is taken care of by Alma (Bibi Andersson) at a remote seaside cottage. Elisabet never speaks to Alma, and so Alma fills the silence with her intimate life stories. After a time it is as if the two woman are gradually becoming one. Alma speaks for, and interprets what Elisabet is thinking. This is a powerful, and thought provoking film, that gradually lays down layers upon layers of images, as it develops this story that becomes something of an unconscious power struggle between, and within, two people, as their identities gradually become reversed over time, as Alma seems like the patient, and Elisabet, the caregiver.

It could also be said that Ingmar Bergman is making a statement about how it is impossible to really know another person, and that we project our ideas and values onto other people. The speechless Elisabet acts like an empty vessel that Alma projects her own ideas and feelings upon. Elisabet is the actor, the blank slate, that changes her personality and character with each role she plays. Perhaps this was also what led her to have her break down. She had lost her sense of self, her identity. Ingmar Bergman reminds us that the film we are watching is a fabrication, a recreation on celluloid, with the initial film clips, and with the fragmenting of the image as the film appears at one point to burn up before resuming the story of the two women. The white light of the projection is the blank slate that the director fills with images and his story, just as Elisabet is the blank slate of Alma's projections of who she thinks Elisabet is. Alma doesn't really know who Elisabet is, she only knows Elisabet from the roles she has played as a screen actress.

I watched this film with the original mono Swedish audio, with English subtitles. There is also an English (mono audio ) dubbed version for the soundtrack, but I wouldn't recommend using it as it spoils the mood and atmosphere of the film. The English dubbed voice used for Alma sounds like a young girl, which gives an altogether different quality to Alma's voice.

There is also a featurette with interviews with the actors and Ingmar Bergman, as well as an audio commentary by Marc Gervais. This is the uncensored, theatrical version of the film, with a new (2004) digital transfer of the film that is presented in the original aspect ratio of 1.33 to 1.

2014 Update:
The 2014 dual format Criterion release includes many more special features than the MGM release, such as a 84 minute interview with Liv Ullmann, on-set footage (18 min), a recent interview with Paul Schrader (10 min), a visual essay on the film's prologue by Bergman scholar Peter Cowie, as well as archival interviews with Bergman, Ullman, and Bibi Andersson. The Criterion release also has a booklet with an essay by film scholar Thomas Elsaesser, as well as excerpts from a 1970 book ""Bergman on Bergman"", and excerpts from a 1977 interview with Andersson. The Criterion release is a new 2K digital restoration with a cleaned up and uncompressed monaural soundtrack on blu-ray.",1260316800,3,3349,4.768965517241379
419574,3,630204135X,"The Bottom Line:

Persona feels more like a pet project of Bergman's than a film meant for mass consumption: it's consistently obtuse, mostly dull, and feels long even at under 90 minutes; unless you're a real Bergman aficionado then stay away from this very unpleasant film.

2.5/4",1248998400,3,282,4.9787234042553195
419575,3,630204135X,"There is little doubt that Ingmar Bergman's cinematic masterpieces have continually redefined the popular notion of film as art, and Persona takes that influence to the extreme. As the film began, with flickering, disintegrating film reels, a phallus, an eviscerated sheep, and a boy lying limp in a morgue, Persona challenged everything I knew about cinema and left me asking two questions: ""Is this art?"" and ""Is there a purpose?"" The answer to both is certainly ""yes,"" though I am not as pleased with the purpose as with the art.

While the film is, on the surface, the story of electively mute actress Elisabet Vogler and her nurse, Alma (""soul"" in Spanish), I choose to see it as a film about two sides of the same person -- two internal voices squabbling over the mess of a complicated life full of dark secrets hidden in shadowy recesses. Additionally, motherhood is an issue raised repeatedly and prominently in the film. Alma still carries the shame of a secret abortion (as well as the pregnancy's genesis) while Elisabet secretly hates her son and wishes he were dead because she is not able to requite his love. It is hard to resist connecting this to the image which frames this film of a young boy yearningly touching a (movie?) screen projecting the intermixing faces of Elisabet and Alma. I choose then to see Bergman as the dichotomous Alma/Elisabet mother, the audience as the yearning children that he alternately rejects (Elisabet) and makes love to (Alma), and film (or perhaps this film) as the insufficient love he attempts to give to his children (and we are reminded by Bergman throughout the film that Persona is a paltry cinematic illusion, not a substantial reality).

I write all of this partially to give new viewers to the film a point of reference against which to contrast their own interpretation of this amorphous work, and I also write this to make it clear that I appreciate the artistry and symbolism behind this film even while I do not appreciate the film, itself.

Here's my issue: I believe that the purpose of art is to connect while instructing. A great film should win your affection (emotionally and/or intellectually) while subtly changing you in the process. This film challenges, and good art should challenge, but it offers me little more than that. Elisabet and Alma, as the only two fully developed persona in the film's reality (of course, they are one persona and it isn't reality), function as everywomen -- norms in the world as Bergman sees it. While Elisabet's elective silence is abnormal, the internal cause behind it is presented as quite the opposite. Even the doctor, a minor character at the beginning of the film, confesses that she understands the underlying issues that haunt Elisabet. She feels them too.

Yet both Alma and Elisabet are monstrous, and I find myself unable and unwilling to connect with them. I don't want to believe that all mothers secretly wish their babies were dead or that all faithful fiances are secretly having wild beach orgies with adolescents while their partners are away. We all hide ugliness within ourselves, but this is more ugliness than I am willing to handle. I am not often bothered by shocking art. Even the sheep having its eye gouged and its intestines ripped out at the beginning didn't disturb me in the slightest, but this misanthropic view of humanity haunts me. Bergman attempts to show us that, beneath the facade, we are all monsters, and then reminds us that he too is a monster hiding behind his art.

It is hard to accept that Persona is a product of the same artist who brought us films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seventh-Seal/dp/6305174083/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seventh Seal</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Strawberries/dp/B00005UQ7T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Strawberries</a>"" which, while asking all the hardest existential questions and challenging our senses of self and purpose in life, ultimately provided opportunities for redemption. There were lessons to be learned, changes that we were inspired to make. Maybe longing for such things sounds contrived and conventional; maybe I sound like the guy who is turned off anytime he doesn't get a happy ending, but all I see beneath Persona's art is the message that we are all truly terrible people deep down inside. I am not able to connect to the protagonists emotionally nor intellectually because of this, and I do not see anything redemptive nor positively transformative about such a conclusion. It leaves its audience on the morgue table, naked and emotionally starved, desperately reaching out to the coldness of the movie screen for a sense of hope that Bergman is either unable or unwilling to give. Ultimately, Persona offers its viewers a lesson in depravity and misanthropy, and nothing more.",1245110400,14,4900,5.158490566037736
419576,4,630204135X,"Often I've read people describe Bergman as essentially a crazy, unpleasant old man living in isolation on a remote island.  Haven't you?  Imagine:  People visit him there, at their peril, it seems, for one has the impression that he lived as a kind of diffident hermit spider who survived on the psychic juice he squeezed out of his victims, which stress-derived juice he transmuted into the visions and insights that became, eventually, his neurasthenic screenplays.  Seems plausible enough.  And here, viewing-reading PERSONA, this cinematic ESSAY ON DEPRESSION projected as a relapse into apathy by a famous actress -- reading it backwards and forwards and looking at it from many angles -- as one should with most abstract art, one can fairly well make out how and out of what material he contrived this movie.

It is a period piece, remember, arising out of that era of Cold War anxiety and Existential nausea -- late 50s - mid 70s -- when nothing seemed either solid or valuable.  It was a time when Psychoanalysis and Shrinks (like Sybils) of different stripes were thought weighty both as symbols and characters in stories (LADY IN THE DARK, EQUS, SPELLBOUND, ON A CLEAR DAY) about the struggles of individuals with and protests against society.  And so Bergman, who was notorious for his psychic instability -- in common with other european auteurs like Almodovar, Passolini and Fassbinder -- dredged the muckbins of his unconscious memories, for themes and incidents he could use.  And, he cannibalized material from others of his friends and colleagues. And he stole for effect when it s uited him; the most obvious example of it being the insertion in the screenplay of the most famous footage from the Viet Nam War, that of the self-immolation of a Buddhist monk, burning for a seeming eternity in the middle of a Saigon street.  Horror (and outrage) by association.  Which is to say, without cost.  Or personal involvement.

We can reconstruct it this way:  Probably at some point Bergman has a mini-breakdown; a fit of apathy like a dry patch of inspiration.  Screenwriter's Block.  He goes to a sympathetic and well-to-do Therapist who is sensitive to his position as ornament of Swedish Theatre and Film, and recommends a stay at his summer, beachfront home.  (The location proves fortuitous for it is close where in future, Bergman will build a home for himself.  There, later, several other of his meditations on mental illness will be written, and some will be filmed.)

Whether it actually true or not, through creative visualization, Bergman switches genders and envisions a situation where the silent, near catatonic patient (based on himself) and her care-taker will assume ""roles.""  (Re-examine Genet's THE MAIDS.)  The roles they assume in the film are that of the patient and Psychiatrist.  (Not Male/Female but Dominant/Passive.)  In typical Freudian theory and practice, the patient transfers his/her concerns on to the Therapist who remains not quite silent, but both distant and non-assertive.

This is very likely a situation familiar to Bergman who was himself cold and distant and non-communicative, often.  And it known that as a womanizer, and charming, he often chose women who were younger and more open, or more suceptible to his crafty form of control and manipulation.  (The Sadie/Mazie waltz.)

In PERSONA, the central confession of the Care-giver/now Patient, is of an intimate, sexual nature.  (Again here, there is a touch of alcohol as the barrier-breaking medium of self-revelation.  [AUTUMN SONATA.]  Which makes me think Bergman probably liked to drink, and got some of his material from his drinking partners.)  Unique in the film's writing, it has the character of an overheard or pilfered confession or recollection from some woman, and here, is used to provoke within the ambiguity of the mis-en-scene, a feeling of sexual ambiguity -- call it a lesbian tweak -- that allows Nyquist to suggest with his camera all kinds innuendos, visually, silently, without degenerating into smut, and this to such a degree that the screen has the look of a Fashion Magazine spread of the period with shots composed in the manner of the fashionable fashion photographers of the day; Penn, Avadon, etc.  In this respect PERSONA is like a hard cover cocktail table book of Blonde-on-Blonde Lesbian Pornography, with the softest conceivable core, and the devine Liv Ulman as the eternal center spread.

Whether or not you think any of these musings even remotely plausible, you are likely to enjoy the film if you are attracted to abstract art, generally, and are entertained by the ambiguities of films of the period like Renais' LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, or Antonioni's L'AVENTURA.  From the very first credits, both artsy, eccentric and disturbing, and that angular irritable music undernearth them, meaning: CAUTION, Montage (or pastiche) ahead, to the initial shot of Ulman heavily painted and in costume playing in a Greek Tragedy and having her fit of Stage Fright or spasm of psychic paralysis, you will know that you're in for a bumpy ride and may expect to be dragged with all deliberate speed over one of the cold beaches of polished rocks off the Swedish holiday coast.  It's a very interesting ride on any number of levels.

When you think of its comparatively brief duration, of PERSONA's tiny cast, and of its black and white format, you may be prompted to realize, with astonishment, how tiny the production budget must have been, and to realize with dawning respect and amazement, with what economy of word and image Bergman and his cinematographer, Nyquist,  managed to construct such a towering hour and a half of fascination.  Like all movies, it's all smoke and mirrors, of course, a shadow play, but their effective articulation is a question of masterful dexterity.  And in PERSONA, the display of the director's Skill in manipulating his ensemble is the star of the show.",1237939200,3,5928,5.047227926078029
419577,5,630204135X,"Just finish watching ""Persona"" from my Ingmar Bergman box set and I must tell you that (after watching ""Through a Glass Darkly"", ""Winter Light"", and ""The Silence"") this was the greatest movie that he ever did. So much that it's one of the five greatest classic movies (pre-1970) I ever saw in my life (other four are ""Bullitt"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""North By Northwest"", and ""Casablanca""). Great performances from Bibi Andersson (who looks like the British actress of that time-Susannah York) and Liv Ullmann (who would start a relationship with the director after he divorced from his wife; even though it lead to nothing despite having a child) as Alma-the nurse who helps troubled young actress Elisabeth Vogler (Ullmann); who has hit a wall when she walks out of rehearsal of the play 'Electra' and refuses to speak. We also get a walk-on role from Ingmar's favorie actor Gunnmar Bjornstord as Elisabeth's husband.

  But the real star is the cinematographer Sven Nykvist (who was Bergman's D.O.P. since ""The Virgin Spring"") and ""Persona"" has to be one of the ten greatest shot films of all time. Just look at the black-and-white and the shadows on the interiors and on the lead actresses' faces: He did an accomplishment that not even all the movies of the film noir genre could create. While the sequence in which Bergman films the same scene twice through the ladies' perspective (instead of cutting back and forth) is astonding.

  There are two scenes that stand out: One is the long dialogue that Andersson gives to Ullmann in which she tells her a story about how she was suntanning naked on a beach with her lady friend when two teenage boys came up. As the camera focuses in on Andersson and Ullmann, Alma explains that it lead to sex between them and that caused her to come home with her husband and have sex again to get pregnant; which she did but she had to have an abortion and was told never to have a child again. I'm telling you that was the first time in a long while that I got an erection from a movie just by dialogue; especially when Alma tells Elisabeth in detail about the foreplay (""He grabbed my breast""), feeling the boy's penis inside her vagina, and experiencing an orgasm. She even said 'Shooting his sperm' at one point!

 The other moment comes when Alma fights with Elisabeth over why she will not talk (I liked that scene before it when Ullmann is sitting on a table wearing a big hat while Andersson is against the wall wearing black glasses and although you don't see eyes, you can tell from her lips that Alma is really pissed off; which leads to her walking up the rock field and throws the glasses off her face and on the ground as if to say 'My gloves are off!'). It leads to Alma getting her nose bloody and in the film's defining moment, after she poked her left cheek, Elisabeth grabs her hand on it and gives a evil smile at her. That gave me chills considering that if they ever do a film montage on the movies in the 1960's that moment would be in there right next to Ernest Borgnine's character Dutch giving an evil smile of his own in ""The Wild Bunch"" (see my review of that movie).

  Then there's Ullmann's performance. It is a shock as to why the Academy people did not nominate her for Best Supporting Actress considering that they nominated Vivien Merchant for ""Alfie"" even though she is in for only one scene while Ullmann is seen for basically the entire film of ""Persona""...and she only speaks THREE TIMES! How can't that be Oscar worthy? Truth be told, I think she should of won it anyway because it's more stronger than the real winner-Sandy Dennis for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" In all, it's a great movie. Leonard Martin in his book said that ""Persona"" is a movie for people that are feeling blue. And he is correct because this is one of the reasons why 1966 was the best year film had in the 60's. Or as what Andersson said to Ullmann as an example, ""I'm not Elisabeth Vogler. You're Elisabeth Vogler.""",1236297600,,3977,4.556022408963585
419578,5,630204135X,"PERSONA ranks as one of Ingmar Bergman's masterpieces. Released in 1966 after a three-year hiatus following his ""chamber films"" of the early 1960s, PERSONA is Bergman's first mature film focusing entirely on human psychology and interpersonal relationships, leaving behind the religious angst of his earlier output.

Even before the action of the film begins, we are treated to an incredible mix of images. We see an arc lamp come to life and film rolling through a projector. A silent comedy film pops up for a few moments, only to be replaced by enigmatic footage of a slaughtered lamb and a hand being nailed to a cross. Finally, a boy wakes up (incidentally the same actor as the child protagonist of Bergman's earlier film TYSNADEN), puts his glasses on, and picks up a book (incidentally the same book as in that earlier film). But he is suddenly distracted, and holds his hand out to the camera. We see the boy touch some invisible screen, as the eerie images of two women alternate upon it. Then, the credits roll. This opening montage may seem unnecessary, but it serves as Bergman's way of hammering home the point that what we are watching is a film, and far from being banal entertainment, cinema is in fact capable of expressing striking truths, as we are about to experience.

The plot of PERSONA initially seems simple. The nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson) is tasked with caring for Elizabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann), an actress who has mysteriously ceased speaking. As Alma jabbers away, while Mrs Vogler says nothing, the action develops much like in Strindberg's play ""Der Starkare"". But a series of events suggests that things are much more complex than they seem. Are Alma and Volger the same woman, representing just two different facets of a single personality? This interpretation is a popular one and quite probable, but the film's mysteries don't end there. What is the meaning of the two historical tragedies Vogler witnesses, the clearing of the Warsaw ghetto and the self-immolation of the Vietnamese monk? Unlike contemporaries like Vilgot Sjoman, Bergman never directly responded to the violence of the mid-century, and I daresay here we get an explanation why, for how can mere words adequately relate to such horror?

If you don't like auteur cinema, and films that are fairly open in interpretation, then I don't know if I can convince you to love PERSONA in a humble Amazon review. Nonetheless, this is a film I highly recommend for the questions it raises. Rarely does one encounter a work of art that provides such satisfying challenge and leaves one thinking about it for a long time after it ends.

Sven Nykvist's cinematography expertly serves Bergman's storytelling. I was especially stunned by a long rolling shot as Alma and Mrs Vogler run along a beach. One gets the sense that after the intentionally limited ""chamber trilogy"", Nykvist was reveling in the greater variety of shots available to him. I'm impressed by how Bergman presents a plot that feels so epic when in locations and casting, at least, this is more similar to the chamber trilogy than the films of the late '50s. Besides Alma and Mrs Vogler, there are only two other characters, a psychaitrist (Margaretha Krook) and Mrs Vogler's husband (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who appear only briefly.",1229904000,,3286,4.947463768115942
419629,4,630204135X,"Two beautiful actresses, almost identical in their physical appearance, bettle it out on screen.  Liv Ullman plays an actress, Elizabeth, who during stage play goes silent (probably every director's nightmare).  There is nothing wrong with her physically or empotionally according to the doctor, so she is assigned a young nurse Alma (Bibi Anderson) to take care of her.  There is no need for them to stay in the hospital, so doctor let's them use her summer house in hopes that fresh air and rest will aid patient's recovery from the unexplainable illness.  As two women settle in house, it is amazing to see them interact in spite of the fact that Elizabeth does not speak at all and the young nurse is doing all the talking.  As the time goes by, it is the young nurse who opens herself up bare to her silent companion.  It is almost as if their roles are reversed.  As long kept secrets keep pouring out, the initial tenderness between two of them turns into violence and cruelty both verbal and physical.  It turns that solitude and deep reflection are cracking their personalities in the ways neither one of them expected.  Or could it be, that the two personalities are part of one that imagines it all as a form of self-healing?  Reconciling one's life is never easy, so it is not surprising the we witness all the psychological twists unfold in front of us.  Deeply intelectual film that can have many meanings, it is quiet, but not slow and engaging from start to finish.

419630,4,630204135X,"Persona, Ingmar Bergman's 1966 black and white film, reminds me of Herman Hesse's novella Siddhartha. Not in the subject matter, but in that both works of art perfectly marry their messages with their forms, and both say so much with so little a narrative spine. In that sense, both are great works of art that transcend any of the discomfit their often dubious artistic and social claims make. Persona has only four main actors, two of which dominate the film, and only one of which speaks. That would be a 25 year old nurse, sister Alma (Bibi Andersson), who is hired to take care of a famous stage actress who has had a nervous breakdown and refuses to speak. This is Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullman). The other two actors who appear and speak are Mr. Vogler (Gunnar Bjrnstrand), who makes a brief hallucinatory appearance late in the film, and the doctor of the asylum where Elisabet is housed and where Alma works (Margaretha Krook).... The title, also, given that Elisabet is an actress, has been endlessly argued over, even though it's perhaps the most manifest part of the film. In his defense, I think Bergman realized that he could not make too long a film out of this material, lest be charged with filmic narcissism, so wisely it only clocks in at about an hour and twenty minutes, for there are loads of people willing to overpraise this film for Bergman, without relying on himself to do so. That said, Bergman does give a little bit of narration, to most manifestly inject himself into the proceedings, as he does in shots where Elisabet is his surrogate, physically guiding Alma in her scenes with Mr. Vogler.
  Bergman takes the usual smug swipes at artists- that they are selfish, lazy, narcissistic, etc., but these are rather hollow moments, as true as they may often be. So are those moments involving pain, ecstasy, truth, ego and superego, and their critique. The real core of the film comes from the most artificial of the artifices. That Bergman acknowledges that art is all artifice (they come from the same Latin root, as I've long championed) it can never be reality nor truth, therefore, what the film really declaims is that all human pretensions to the nobility of art and truth and suffering are just that, pretensions. That so few people and critics have not realized that Bergman is not attacking the `deep' questions of existence, in this film, but affirming the immediacy of the shallow, is part of the film's brilliance. And this is true, whether or not Bergman claims it so, because the intent of the artist is meaningless. Once the art is completed, he or she has no more claim over it than any other interested percipient of it.
 That all said, the film is a technical tour de force due to the stellar camera work of cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The composition and lighting of every scene is breathtaking, heightened by the black and white (mixed with multiple grays), which is the true coin of the dream state, which this film fully exploits. Also, other than Alma's speaking, much of the rest of the film works as a de facto silent film, recalling to me the great Carl Theodor Dreyer film Vampyr, or Roman Polanski's Repulsion, which came out a year earlier. Both films are superior to Persona, for both have better tales, and are less self-conscious. Repulsion was set in a real world setting, and took off from there, while Persona is all artifice, with experimentation at its core. But that fact does not deny Persona its own form of greatness. There are numerous scenes which blatantly and slyly reference vampires, and Persona seems to have lifted much of its imagery and symbolism from Polanski's film, and Bergman's own earlier The Silence. Persona is indeed a horror film, in the sense that all horror is based internally, not in monsters manifested externally.
  Many critics refer to this film as deconstructive or Postmodern, but they are again missing the point. Those terms are merely inward terms, gawking at the art. That is only the veneer of this film, the toolkit used, as it gazes outward at the viewer. The film, however, is a small film, in every sense of the term, which holds up a mirror to the viewer, not the art it is. In that sense, it is anti-deconstructive, for the art is what it is, and the viewer is the subject matter under examination. The acting by Andersson and Ullman is consummately fine, especially with Ullman's realistic and hyper-realistic acting without words. Only four decades into the talky era, she has utterly shed all of the artifices silent films' acting required, and the acting and visual virtuosity of the film are more than enough to cancel out the hollow psychology, and dated artsy clichs.
  Persona is self-conscious, narcissistic, and not too psychologically deep, for there is no real reason offered for Alma's identification with Elisabet, nor her breakdown, but it is the ultimate style over substance film, and as such attains its true greatness, despite the visual sleight of hand that leads many to be sucked into its hollow posturing as some source of great depth. But, more so, it's a grandly entertaining film, more than it is a deep one, giving the psychologically nave much to talk about as Bergman deceives the viewer into deep thought over the shallow. As such, it was most deserving of its Oscar for Best Foreign Film in the year of its release, but I urge every viewer to ignore any reviews of the film beforehand, even this one, for a naked approach to it is the only way to fully plumb its essence. Good luck.",1221436800,,5524,4.741935483870968
419631,4,630204135X,"They say that Bergman is a complex director. But he's really all about one thing: cruelty. Almost all of his major films are about people hurting other people. The violence can be physical, like in ""The Virgin Spring,"" but usually it plays out through lengthy dialogues and monologues. The characters choose their words very carefully, in order to construct the most devastating phrasing. In all of cinema, Bergman is the absolute master of the art of hurting people with words.

About halfway through his career, Bergman stopped dressing up the emotional abuse with religious allegory. His films became less dependent on plot, their settings became narrower and more intimate. But the more they were reduced to their cruel essence, the more shockingly convincing they became. The later films are Bergman's best work -- ""Cries And Whispers"" (the best, in my opinion), ""Scenes From A Marriage"" and ""Autumn Sonata"" are all vicious and riveting. The one exception is ""Fanny And Alexander,"" which is much kinder than usual, perhaps because Bergman had some warm feelings about childhood.

""Persona"" fits into this fine tradition. The cinematography is stark and unadorned. The sets have very few props, which appear when they are needed and disappear again. Many scenes take place against a plain white background, without even discernible walls. It's impossible to get any sense of the layout of the house the characters live in. There are only four people in the film, only one of whom has a large speaking role. For the most part, the camera alternates between close-ups of their faces. Half of each face is often covered in shadow, which leads to an unsettling visual trick toward the end.

The sterile visuals put the focus on the emotional conflict. Only Bergman could have thought of that famous scene where Alma moves the piece of glass into Elisabeth's way. That elaborate, passive-aggressive malice is his calling card. The scene is similar in spirit to the flashbacks in ""Cries And Whispers"" where the women drive their husbands to despair. Bergman's characters attack with something as delicate as nudging a piece of glass with one's foot.

Prior to this scene, the film feels slow. The odd, arty opening, the cinematography, the silent main character are all disconcerting, and make it difficult to feel involved. But when the sharp piece of glass appears on the ground, the effect is heart-stopping. Before Alma has even moved, while she's still eyeing Elisabeth's movements, the hostility is so tangible that it's overwhelming. From there, it doesn't let up until the end.

The verbal violence comes later, in the other famous scene, the double monologue in the end. It doesn't really matter whether Alma's assessment of Elisabeth's character is accurate. She wants to draw blood (a literal wound suddenly appears soon after), so she says exactly those things that will hurt Elisabeth the most. Her choice of words is extremely sophisticated -- you'd have to try pretty hard just to think of the things she says, even if you were talking to your worst enemy. And, of course, she winds herself up as she's talking. Bergman's characters hate themselves as much as they hate everyone else. So, Elisabeth's silence is an equally sophisticated response, it's like a nightmare where you can't get through to your interlocutor no matter what you say.

While Alma speaks, the camera shows Elisabeth's silent face. Then, the monologue is repeated, but now the camera shows Alma talking. Bergman's reuse of the same dialogue in this scene has already been analyzed by everyone. But I think it's simple -- the film repeats the scene so that you won't miss any of the pain inflicted by the words. This way, you get the full reaction from both women, first you're forced to watch Elisabeth listening to the whole thing, then Alma speaking it.

You might ask if Bergman had any point in mind aside from showing people emotionally devastating each other. I don't know -- I'm sure there are many interpretations of the film that try to find one. But I don't think it matters that much. Although Alma talks a lot in the film, Bergman never really gives you any way to understand her. Her long sex monologue (Bergman may appear boring and old-fashioned now, but actually, he is often extremely explicit) really only shows that she's a very cold person. For this reason, she deeply resents having to be nice to people, including her husband. That's about it. Bergman is always more convincing when he's depicting coldness than when he's trying to explain it. ""Autumn Sonata"" is like that too.

Are there any actual people who act like these characters in real life? Maybe, maybe not, but that's beside the point. The hostility is very real, however stylized the expression. Why you'd want to watch that is another question, but if you do, it may be hard to forget.",1220745600,4,4856,4.942401960784314

419633,5,630204135X,"""Persona"" isn't one of my favorite Bergman films, although better people than I--including Susan Sontag and Bergman himself--consider it his masterpiece.  I'm sure that part of my uneasiness with it is that I just can't quite figure out what's going on in it.  Is it a parable about the various personae we all wear to protect ourselves from not only the prying eyes of others but also from our own inner scrutiny?  Are Alma and Elisabet alter egos of one and the same person, with Alma being the wild, untamed id and Elisabet the more constricted superego (I realize that this neat Freudian division fails to do justice to the richness of either character)?  Is the film the story about two actually different women, one of whom--Alma--is sinking deeper and deeper into psychosis and increasingly abusing the other?  All of these interpretations (and others, I'm sure) could be drawn from the film.

My best guess is that ""Persona"" (or better, I think, ""personae,"" since Alma and Elisabet, in addition to perhaps being masks themselves, each wear multiple masks--masks on top of masks, if you will) is the story of the split in humans that stories such as Hesse's Narcissus and Goldmund, Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Dostoevsky's The Double explore:  the reserved, contemplative, Apollonian side of us and the frenzied, ecstatic Dionysian side.  The two can co-exist, but they can frequently feud against one another.  Alma the Dionysian and Elisabet the Apollonian, each projecting onto the other, each intimately attracted to and violently repulsed by the other, each longing for and fearing integration:  this, I think, might be what's going on in the film.  If so, ""Persona"" really is an important parable about what it means to be human.

The acting is superb.  Bibi Andersson is astounding in the sheer energy she brings to the role of Alma, and Liv Ullmann's ability to convey deep and various emotions with only subtle facial expressions takes away my breath.  But one of the reasons the film isn't my favorite is that I think the famous opening scenes are distractions, and smack too much of the self-consciously arty hijinks that gets so much European cinema mocked at.

Does this mean that the film doesn't deserve 5 stars?  Not a bit.",1215648000,2,2259,4.920844327176781

419659,5,630204135X,"Where to begin with a film like Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA? It's both a famous and infamous example of world cinema in its heyday (the 1960's, mostly), working hard to stretch the medium past traditional or straightforward storytelling. It's famous, of course, because it was directed by Ingmar Bergman, the legendary Swedish film director (THE SEVENTH SEAL, WILD STRAWBERRIES), featured two of his acting mainstays Bibi Andersson and Gunnar Bjornstrand and introduced Liv Ullmann, who would figure prominently in both Bergman's personal life and professional career. It's infamous because it is usually regarded as a ""difficult"" film, subject to much critical commentary and debate (which is exactly the kind of response a great film should generate, right?). Was it Susan Sontag who said this was, by and large, a modernist vampire story? I don't know if I agree, but this gives some idea of the range of critical dispute.

After a short but enigmatic prologue, the film opens up into a accessible narrative: that of an actress named Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullman) who mysteriously falls silent during a stage performance of Medea (a meaningful play choice in the context of the film) and thereafter will not speak. She is sent to a hospital/clinic where she is assigned to an enthusiastic, inexperienced nurse named Alma (Bibi Andersson). The doctor sends Alma and Elisabeth to her seaside home as a sort of ""therapy,"" where their new friendship gathers an intensity which leads, ultimately, to psychological warfare and strange and symbolic happenings. If this sounds vague, well, that's mainly because the latter part of the film is difficult to summarize (especially without including one's own interpretation of what's ""actually"" going on).

One thing to notice in PERSONA is its indebtedness to dramatic forms: that is, stage performance. It is certainly no accident how much of the film feels very spare and theatrical. In the hospital, for instance, we see only three persons, Elisabeth, Alma, and the doctor. The hospital rooms are very empty and look, quite consciously, like a stage set. Although the prologue and epilogue include, fleetingly, a few other actors, only four actors have significant roles in the film--two of which dwarf the other two. All of this points very specifically to the notions of art and drama, and more generally, to the that of artifice versus truth; we are intended to sense the artificial structures of the film because they contribute largely to the film's meaning: What constitutes truth? Are we ever, properly speaking, not acting in some way? Can we refuse to participate in the drama of life or are we actors, whether willingly or not?

Let me add that PERSONA is not a characteristic Bergman film by any means. It is far more stylistically adventurous than most of his other films and seems to mark a break of sorts with the chamber dramas of the early 1960's, although there is a certain affinity with THE SILENCE, the final enigmatic film in the ""religious trilogy."" What I am saying is that, if you know and like THE SEVENTH SEAL or MONIKA or SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT, don't expect such austere storytelling in PERSONA, which is a forceful film partially because it can't quite be critically resolved.",1174867200,6,3250,5.048417132216015
419660,5,630204135X,"Persona (Ingmar Bergman, 1966)

It's been a while since I've added a movie to my all-time 100-best list after only one viewing. I've been doing a good deal of shifting stuff around recently, but always with movies I've seen ten, fifteen, twenty times that have held up well over decades. Tonight, however, I saw Ingmar Bergman's Persona for the first time, and I really found myself with no choice. I've seen a few Bergman movies over the years, and I've always found them thought-provoking and enjoyable; this is the first one, however, that's grabbed me by the throat and not let go until the final frame.

Bergman's eerie meditation on identity begins with Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann), a famous actress, in the hospital after what we assume is some sort of mental breakdown. A young nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson), is assigned to care for her, and as part of Elisabeth's recuperation, the two spend the summer in a remote cottage on the shore. Elisabeth is mute, but Alma does enough talking for both of them. The isolation and Elisabeth's continuing silence, however, begin to play tricks on Alma's mind-- or is her reality changing?

The movie hinges on Andersson's performance, which is as shocking today as it must have been in 1966-- her dialogue ranges from the mundane to the explicit, and she delivers it all with the same bubbliness (at least, in the early stages of the movie). Her character never slips, and she plays it to the hilt. Absolutely riveting. Even more impressive, however, is Ullmann, the silent spectre who often seems as if she's floating through the background of the movie; she doesn't have the benefit of dialogue here, so the power of her role comes solely from her body-- her facial expressions, the way she moves, her posture. And despite the greatness of Andersson's performance, Ullmann steals the show here. That's impressive.

419661,4,630204135X,"In the early '60s, Bergman's visual and narrative style became ever more austere in focusing on tormented souls seeking guidance and comfort from an empty heaven, thus paving the way for a stark foray into extreme close-up in the enigmatic ""Persona.""

A modernist masterpiece, the film initiated an introspective trilogy about the ivory towers built by artists as a defense against the horror of existence... It was Bergman's first completely innovative work, acknowledging itself as artifice through the regular insertion of non-narrative images such as projectors burning, film breaking, fragment of silent movies...

""Persona"" depicts the vampiric relationship between a talkative nurse and an actress who refuses to speak or work after a traumatic realization of the futility of creation in a loveless world surrounded by war... Psychology, philosophy and social comment are mixed to brilliant effect in a complex, clear interrogation both of filmic illusion and of the illusory values of modern life...",1168387200,2,1007,5.532467532467533
419662,5,630204135X,"When talking of Bergman, critics and viewers usually name ""Wild Strawberries"", ""The Seventh Seal"" or ""Cries and Whispers"" ahead of Persona. While those films are all amazing and stay very high on my list of all time favorites, for me, the truly unique and unforgettable is ""Persona"" - Bergman's enigmatic masterpiece.

The story is seemingly simple:

""A nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson), has been assigned to care for a famous actress, Elizabeth (Liv Ullman), who suddenly stopped speaking during a performance of Electra and has remained silent ever since. When they go to stay in a seaside house owned by Alma's psychiatrist colleague, the apparently self-confident nurse gradually reveals more and more of herself in the face of Elizabeth's silence, and is shocked to read a letter the actress has written implying that Alma is an interesting case-study. The two women seem almost to exchange identities, or to become one (strikingly expressed visually in a famous shot); in a dream sequence (or perhaps fantasy), Elizabeth's husband comes to visit and seems to think that Alma is his wife. Finally Alma, back in her nurse's uniform, catches a bus to go home, leaving the almost-mute Elizabeth alone.""

Whether Alma was able to get her identity back remains one of the film's many questions.

What is absolutely wonderful in the film - performances from two actresses. Anderson is the one who has to carry almost the entire dialog, her voice is one of the film's priceless treasures while Ullman is equally powerful in expressing hundreds of emotions through her face and eyes. Sven Nykvist's camera, the third star of the film makes two stars shine so bright.

Each scene in 81 minutes long film is memorable, some of them just unforgettable. For instance, the long scene where Alma reveals her most intimate memories of a sexual encounter with two boys while sunbathing nude with another girl on an empty beach, is infinitely more erotic to listen to than it would have been to see in flashback.

There is so much to think about in Persona. One major question concerns Elizabeth's silence: is it elective, as happens in Tarkovsky's ""Andrei Rublyov"" , or is it some kind of mental breakdown?. The documentaries about the war horrors that Elizabeth watches on TV suggest the former; the fact that it suddenly happens during a stage performance of ""Electra"" suggests the latter. I keep thinking about it. Why ""Electra"" of all plays? The story of the daughter who hated her mother and wanted her dead - does it reflect the accusation brought up by Alma that Elizabeth did not love her deformed son and wanted him dead? Did Elizabeth become so overwhelmed by guilt realizing that her life reminded so much of Electra's story? We don't know for sure, and Bergman does not help. The identical monologue in which Alma is accusing Elizabeth is the film's resolution. We hear it twice: first time, camera is concentrating on Elizabeth's face, second time - on Alma's. Is Alma talking about Elizabeth or herself or both? After that encounter on the beach, Alma became pregnant and had an abortion. The monologue may reflect her feelings of guilt and emptiness as well as Elizabeth's. Does it really happen?

Is Elizabeth a vampire sucking the life out of her victims only to use them as characters for her acting roles? Is that the ultimate price the artist is paying for being a great artist? Does he need lives and souls of others to be able to create? Can he/she love the ones who utterly depend on them and need their love? This film and later Autumn Sonata (1978) with Ingrid Bergman as a concert pianist show famous stars as selfish women who can't and don't love their children. The same question was brought up also in the earlier ""Through a Glass Darkly (1961)"" - in the relationship of the writer and his daughter.

Then there is the question of whether there are really two women at all; could the whole film be played out as a fantasy of one of them, or indeed of somebody else? Is there a sexual attraction between the two women? It might be or might be not. I believe, David Lynch has watched ""Persona"" very carefully, thought about it and used some of its ideas in his own ""Mullholland Dr.""

There are so many questions in this incredible film that are left unanswered. For almost forty years, viewers and filmmakers alike have been trying to find the answers. One thing is obvious - this is one of the films you want to watch over and over again. I think it should be seen by any viewer. If you've seen it already - see it again. You'll learn something new. If you have not seen it - you are in for a great experience. See it for Sven Nykvist's camera work, for Liv's face, for Bibi's voice, for the unique and mysterious world that is Ingmar Bergman's universe.",1168387200,32,4768,4.734939759036145
419663,5,630204135X,"Persona and The Seventh Seal are commonly called the masterpieces of Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman. I've seen The Seventh Seal, with images that have been parodied and plagiarized endlessly; A movie with a pretty straightforward narrative sans a few scenes here and there. Then there is Persona, a movie that seems to have a straightforward narrative but makes you think anyway. This isn't a movie like Mulholland Dr. or something, so the fact that it confuses is actually confusing. It begins with a brilliant opening sequence, which seems to suggest it's beginning at the birth of cinema. It includes random, sometimes subliminal, images flashing across the screen before a white title card with black print appears, reading: Persona. Maybe the movie is held within the title. Persona, singular. Liv Ullmann plays Elisabeth, an actress whom suddenly stopped speaking in the middle of a stage performance. Now in a hospital, a psychiatrist suggest to a twenty-five year old, engaged nurse named Alma (Bibi Andersson) that she spend the summer with Elisabeth in a secluded house. Once there, there's a strange dynamic with Alma doing all the talking and Elisabeth doing all the listening. The patient-caregiver relationship the two have suddenly becomes a much deeper psychic attraction. One scene that occurs, almost without warning, seems to underline this attraction...Elisabeth and Alma's faces combine, like a morph. I think few people will argue that this is one of the great shots in cinema, despite not being incredibly difficult to do. This is the kind of movie that could have been made by many people, but no one could have made it like Bergman did. First off, the movie came out in 1967, well into the ""color"" era, even though most filmmakers still hadn't experimented much with color. This movie, if made today by Bergman, would probably still be shot in black-and-white. Most films that use B&W in today's cinema use it for a good reason and for a film like Persona, I don't think it could be done in color. The cinematography gives it a much more stark, disturbing quality. The movie has aged perfectly, hardly aged at all. It looks like it could've been made this year and digitally drained of color. The performances, also, are incredible; Ullmann says a single sentence in the movie (technically...you'll know what I mean if you've seen the movie) and yet her eyes seem to serve as a way to fuel her performance. There's one stunning scene in Persona, which (from what I've read) it seems most people remember from the movie. Alma tells Elisabeth a story involving a beach, her friend, and two boys. Most writer/directors wouldn't dare write a monologue like this into a film. Not because of the content, but because they would fear it would test the viewer's patience. This scene is more detailed when spoken that it could've been had they filmed it. I could easily explained what Alma had said, as if I'd seen the actual event occur onscreen. Since I've only seen three films by Bergman (The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, and this) and I've only seen them once, I'd have to view this and The Seventh Seal to decide which one is better. Either way, I notice that this film was listed in a book called The 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. And you do.

Persona is a film which explores the psychological nature of identity, despair, the inner quest for individualism, and more importantly the philosophical theme of existence. As always those interested in existentialism and/or Nihilism need look no further than this Bergman masterpiece to supplement their curiosities in the uncanny/subconscious world. Not only does Bergman masterfully explore these themes through complex dialogue (as he's famous for), but also through beautifully imagery.

While literally dozens of scholarly papers on aesthetics and film studies have successfully explored the imagery in Persona, such on-screen representations of emotional and psychological turmoil on the part of the main characters should not be missed. From the famous ""burn"" during the film's climax (which I mention further in an aesthetics/Bergman article recently written), to the shadow-play of dark and light Bergman uses during the film: this film is amazing.

Regardless of what past reviews say, this is one of Bergman's more ""tame"" works as far as representational content is concerned and yet it manages to truly be an intense, eye-opening experience. Admittedly in the past some Bergman films - despite being of good quality - have been long, drawn out, and somewhat tiring (reading philosophical texts are sometimes similar).

419667,5,630204135X,"""Persona"" is not the easiest of Ingmar Bergman's films to understand, but it is certainly one of his most cerebral. And there's the rub. He picks our brain, exploring the depths of guilt and despair, both of the mute actress Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) and attending nurse Alma(Bibi Andersson). And yet, it is not a depressing film. On the contrary, it makes you think about the healing process the psyche undergoes to recover when it is hurt.

The film itself marks Bergman's break from the symbolism notably seen in his earlier works such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seventh-Seal-Criterion-Collection/dp/6305174083/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seventh Seal - Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Virgin-Spring-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000BR6QIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Virgin Spring - Criterion Collection</a>.

If you scratch the surface deeper, you might even find this psychological film alludes to the Freudian or Jungian concepts of the feminine persona.

Aside from these references, Bergman deconstructs the film before our very eyes as though he is probing the make-up of one's personality. He splices cartoon frames, silent films with his own creation. The film is burnt at one point. The images of Elisabeth Vogler and Alma are melded together to suggest similarity and resolution. A young adolescent boy is seen at the beginning with seemingly no purpose, until at the end we realise this child represents their shared guilt.

Photographer Sven Nykvist's close-ups of Ullman and Andersson are intimate, allowing us to scrutinise their facial expressions and body language for telltale clues to their problem. Bergman's common use of silhouettes on white backgrounds and vice-versa are here too. So are the cleansing seascapes with the lone figure.

One of the most intriguing scenes in the film is Alma's walking on shards of glass without cutting her bare feet, as if her own soul is on edge. The erotic scene where she confesses to Elisabeth Vogler of a sexual encounter years ago and her abortion is the climax (pardon the pun) of the film and foreshadows the revelation to come. And that revelation is Elisabeth Vogler's own guilt; it is her inability to deal with the responsibilities of motherhood, hence her silence and the teenage boy touching the image of his mother at the end.  It's a powerful image depicting disconnection, isolation and loneliness.

All in all, MGM has put together a credible DVD package inclusive of the film, trailer, an Ingmar Berman interview in 1970, interviews with Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann in 2002 and analysis with film critic and comments from Andersson and Ullmann. To be honest, I was reluctant initially to buy this MGM version, but I must confess after having reviewed the content that it is comparable to any Criterion package and well worth the purchase.",1147651200,8,3359,5.972972972972973
419668,5,630204135X,"There is a mood that Bergman creates in his films that is special.  An intention seems to run so deep beneath the surface that we can only peel back layers of understanding but never arrive at the final solution.  One suspects that this intention is beyond Bergman himself who only provides a vehicle for its imperfect expression: a stage for the unpredictable interaction of autonomous concepts; which in Persona include ambition, sensual love, envy, fate, and madness.

Liv Ullman's retreat from a savage world - her attempt to step off the merry-go-round - ends unexpectedly as the fate which has been frustrated in expressing itself through her persona begins to work through her caretaker, Bibi Andersson .  Ullman is left to watch, horrified, as an intrinsic piece of her identity is appropriated by someone else.  The self-immolation of the monk that Ullman had earlier retreated from is encountered once more as a kind of bonfire of her own vanity.  Fate is the consequence of a person's actions, and it catches up with Ullman who has run away from the responsibility of raising her son.  Andersson's own approach to an unwanted pregnancy is shown to be a more responsible reaction to life's challenges, yet it haunts her and provides the catalyst for the operation of Ullman's fate.

Did Bergman intend to communicate all this at the outset?  I don't know or care.  This is moviemaking as a higher calling: an attempt to create an experience so rich that it leaves an indelible impression on the viewer, and changes him for the better.  It is mythmaking.",1146700800,3,1563,4.882575757575758
419690,5,630204135X,"The word ""persona"" stands for the roles people assume on stage or in the world.  It relates back to the masks that actors wore in ancient Greek drama.  What happens in art or life when we refuse to wear our masks?  What if we can't keep them on?  How then are we to live?  Persona is perhaps the furthest flight ever made by a filmmaker in search of answers to these questions.

Bergman shot Persona in the mid sixties, a time when all the big constructs - personal identity, the nature of art, the role of the individual in society - were up for grabs.  The opening of the movie seems to mirror the intellectual jumble of the times: shots of film stock, a camera, an arc lamp; several disturbing images dredged up from the swamp of the adult unconscious; finally, an adolescent boy in a hospital-like room.  The boy gets out of bed and walks toward the blurry, blown-up photograph of a woman's face.

After this disconcerting beginning, Bergman drops us into the actual start of the story.  Elisabeth (Liv Ullman) is a famous actress who suddenly refuses to speak.  She's sent to a psychiatric institution where she's attended by Alma, a young, seemingly nave nurse (Bibi Andersson in one of the bravura performances in world cinema).  Elisabeth turns on the television in her hospital room and sees one of the sixties' most indelible images:  a Vietnamese monk burning himself alive on a sidewalk as a war protest.  Perhaps Elisabeth stays silent because she refuses to participate in such a horrific world.

Elisabeth's psychiatrist arranges for a rest cure in a summer cottage on a small island off the Swedish coast, and sends Alma along to care for her.  Once on the island, Alma's nurse mask starts to slip.  She drinks too much one night and tells Elisabeth about an odd sexual encounter she had several years back with another woman and two boys.  We watch the silent Elisabeth drink in Alma's words like a vampire draining the life force from a victim.  Elisabeth's voyeurism feels almost repulsive, but then we realize it's no different from our own.

Alma tells Elisabeth that the sexual experience she described led to an abortion, after which she can no longer bear children.  Elisabeth then casually reveals Alma's sexual secrets in a letter that Alma peeks at on the way to the post office.  This betrayal knocks Alma off center.  The kind, deferential nurse deliberately leaves a piece of broken glass where Elisabeth will step on it.  Alma doesn't know herself any more, which Bergman dramatizes by cutting to a shot of the film stock snapping in two.

Social conventions are abandoned.  Alma gives over to primal emotions - anger, violence, lust, cruelty - to try and break through Elisabeth's wall of silence.  Alma attacks Elisabeth for being a monstrous egotist, and accuses her of hating her son and wishing he was dead.  Andersson does all the talking in this scene, but the camera is focused exclusively on Ullman's face.  Then Andersson repeats the same monologue, word for word, only this time the camera stays fixed on her own face.  Now we're not sure if Alma is talking about Elisabeth's son or describing the guilt she felt at aborting her own child.  Alma denies that she's like Elisabeth; at the same time, on the screen their two faces merge into one.

From here, fantasy and reality blur even further.  In one gruesome sequence, Elisabeth literally sucks the blood from Alma's arm.  Alma briefly surrenders.  A look of sexual pleasure flits across her face, but then she recoils and slaps Elisabeth viciously across the cheek.  In another dreamlike scene, Alma, back in uniform at the hospital, wakes up Elisabeth and holds her.  ""It's all nothing,"" Alma says.  Which is what all of Bergman's authorial intrusions into Alma and Elisabeth's story seem to be telling us: creative illusions are just that, no thing. Yet they signify everything, and great artists will surrender their social and psychological security in service to them.

The two women pack up and leave the cottage.  The movie ends with a series of images that relate back to the opening.  There's Elisabeth back on stage - is she cured, or has she succumbed to a worse illness than silence and withdrawal?  We see a closeup of a mask sculpture that we saw before outside the cottage, then a cut to the film crew, including the great cinematographer Sven Nykvist behind his camera.  Alma flags down a bus, presumably headed back to her ""normal"" life as a hospital nurse.  We see the little boy from the opening sequence again, looking at images of Ullman's and Andersson's faces.  The film unspools, and we're staring at a screen gone to black.

For movie that deals with such abstract ideas, Persona is surprising sensual.  The camera caresses the faces of Ullman and Andersson; they caress each other; Sven Nykvist sculpts the light into pleasing, mysterious textures.  Using only a black and white palette, Bergman turns morning into twilight, sun to shadow, beautiful faces into harpy masks.  The rhythms of physical reality shift and morph like the psychological foundations of Alma's identity.

In a sense, Bergman has recast the Icarus myth.  Elisabeth soars above accepted social constraints, but may not be able to return to normal life.  Too much self-knowledge that she can't emotionally handle melts Alma down, as surely as solar heat melts wax wings. In this, as in his other movies, Bergman, despite his own bouts of incapacitating doubt and despair, simply refuses to stop flying right toward the sun.",1130803200,14,5516,4.838675213675214
419691,5,630204135X,"Whoa, man.  Take a deep breath.  Here we have it: the cinematic equivalent of ""Hamlet"" -- meaning, the piece of work that re-writes all the rules on its own terms, and so creates a newer, bigger idea of the ""Self"" in art (and thus, in the world).

Nothing you can say about this thing can fully encompass what it IS.  There's a whole universe in there.  Do I know what this movie ""really"" means?  Of course not!  (or, only a little bit.)

Some movies are like a deep, clear well that people can drink from, and get refreshed by, again and again over time.  But ""Persona"" is like the enormous underground aquifer that feeds all of those wells.  Almost every really serious movie that's been made since 1966 has had to come to terms with it: either they are kinda-sorta attempted re-makes of ""Persona"" (everything from 'Two-Lane Blacktop' to 'Apocalypse Now'), or else they are struggling to avoid its immense gravitational pull -- the way that American novelists from the '70s until now had to either imitate ""Gravity's Rainbow,"" or else pretend that it didn't exist.  You can never really get to the bottom of this movie: it shows you something new and startling every time you watch it.

What's really astonishing is that it all unfolds on such a ""small"" scale: the whole thing is really just two women in a hospital and then a summer house, with no big sets, no effects, and almost no ""story"" to speak of.  Kind of like splitting the atom: you had no idea so much energy was hidden inside that tiny speck.

One of the five or so films* that I would use to try and explain to space-aliens what ""movies"" are, and why they're so cool, and so important.  And don't get me started on that opening sequence....

419692,5,630204135X,"Persona is probably my favorite Ingmar Bergman film.  Watching it again, I now realize that it is a ghost story.  Were ever characters more haunted than Bergman's?  Everything about the film is eerie, especially the music.  Everything has the feel of a horror film, even though nothing ""scary"" actually happens.  The horror is of Being and Nothingness.  Persona does what so much of horror literature attempts - undermine our conceptions of what is real.  Bergman is not content to do only that - he undermines the conventions of moviemaking as well: half-way through the movie, the film breaks and needs to be re-started.

It is almost impossible to summarize the ""plot.""  Liv Ullman's character decides to stop talking.  She is sent to a summer home in care of a nurse - Bibi Anderson.  Gradually, the two personalities begin to merge until we realize that there may have only been one person in the house to begin with.

Persona is an art film if ever there was one.  It stands next to 2001: A Space Odyssey as one of the great experimental pictures of the 1960's.  It contains one of the most erotic scenes in cinema, even though there is no nudity.  It foreshadows a new era of filmmaking.

The DVD transfer is pristine, however it is NOT letterboxed.  For some reason the subtitles remain white, instead of the more user-friendly yellow.  There is also an invaluable featurette on the making of the film with interviews of all the principals, including Bergman.  A must for any serious DVD collection.",1124496000,2,1507,4.771317829457364

There is really no words to truly describe the haunting, poetic, and erotic mood, feeling, and plot of this entire film and it's two exemplary female characters. This is truly a visual feast, at times cringing, beautiful, haunting, sad, erotic, and at the end, profound. This is a film that will truly make you think. For instance, the boy in the beginning can symbolize two things: Elisabeth's neglected child, or Alma's unborn child. And of course, the most haunting scene in cinema is when Alma, dressed in the same black clothing as Elisabeth, talks about Elisabeth's neglection of motherhood and marriage, while to some degree she's talking about her own naive view on both of these topics. Then, at the end, both of their faces emerge, exemplifying the exploration of a psychoanalysis breaking into subtle madness! That scene will always remain in my mind, it's so haunting in a deep and profound way. This film truly has the immense emotion and intensity that is highly rare in movies today. The end is even just as profound when we are back at the scene with the boy watching a screen of what appears to be the face of Elisabeth (or Alma? Both?), but then the reel breaks apart, and then the light that was lit in the beginning of the film suddenly fades into darkness. If you want to watch a film that is not cliche and predictable, watch PERSONA. But beware, a film like this should be watched with an OPEN MIND.

There is a story to it but the thing becomes fractured midway through and from then on you have to make your own way through this movie. It does question the impact of friendships and the deceit and betrayal that can come from them. It's all very real in a sense and then it's not. It is that which questions our own take on reality.

419695,5,630204135X,"I first saw Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona"" about eight years ago. I was fourteen years old at the time and after watching the film I was utterly confused as to what I had just seen and yet at the same time I knew I had just seen one of the greatest films I would ever see. Conversation after conversation the movie would come up. I only saw it that one time but I felt as if I could recite the entire film for you. It had that kind of lasting power. The film stays with, absorbs your thoughts.

 The story goes during the 1960's critics of Ingmar Bergman were starting to complain the master was old hat. His films were starting to look pale when compared to the French New Wave. Could Bergman compete with directors such as Jean-Luc Godard? Was Bergman's style of filmaking boring? Was it heavy-handed and stifle? In reaction to these comments Bergman decided to shut them all up and thus ""Persona"" was made. And it didn't exactly shut the critics up. Now they started saying what kind of genius Bergman was. Here with one film Bergman proved his methods were not old-fashion. One of Bergman's next films, ""Hour of the Wolf"" would also be experimental, but would be considered one of his ""lesser"" films. Though I've noticed on amazon that people seem to be rediscovering that film. Because DVD has something to do with that. Now it people is easy to obtain and younger people are starting to watch it. But back to ""Persona"".

 We can immediately sense the contradictions between Elizabeth (Liv Ullmann, ""A Passion of Anna"", ""Shame"") and Alma (Bibi Andersson, ""The Touch"", ""The Devil's Eye""). Elizabeth has been mute for three months. Alma is a very talkative person. Elizabeth is married and has a child. Alma is not, but would like to start a family. And has the film goes on we find out a shocking secret about Alma's past. It would appear we are getting two sides of the same personality. At one point Alma even says she think she and Elizabeth are the same person.

 Elizabeth is an actress and Alma is a nurse that has been assigned to take care of her. Soon it is clear nothing mentally is wrong with Elizabeth and there is really no need to keep her, but she refuses to go home. Soon it is suggested Alma and Elizabeth share a summer house.

 At this point and perhaps even before it ""Persona"" manages to have a nightmare quality to it. It is hard for us to believe what we are seeing is real. The walls of reality are quickly crumbling. We start to question who is who. Does Elizabeth complete Alma or does Alma complete Elizabeth. Who's story is it really?

 One of the film's most intense moments comes near the end when Alma notices Elizabeth hiding a picture of her son. What is extremely important here is the way Bergman and cinematographer Sven Nykvist have set up the shot. It is a close up of Alma's face as she tries to guess what made Elizabeth want to become a mother. But soon it is clear, we are not talking about Elizabeth. We are talking about Alma. The scene is really a confession. Alma looks directly at us. We must confront her and she must confront us. Bergman then uses a split screen and now we see half of Alma's face and half of Elizabeth's. Bergman is doing more than just drawing a pcture for us. He's beating us on the head with it after he's done drawing it. We get the connection.

 ""Persona"" was an extremely influential film, especially on American directors such as Robert Altman (""3 Women"") and David Lynch (""Mulholland Drive""). But even in their cases they don't seem to be working on the same level as Bergman. He seems to be a step ahead of them. It is as if ""Persona"" can not be duplicated.

 But perhaps I'm wrong about everything I've said. Perhaps there are no parallels between Elizabeth and Alma. Maybe the film is not about guilt, trauma, identity lost, the way people expect us to act in society or even the role of women. Maybe the film is really about how to file your income tax. But at least I've made you think. And that was all this review was suppose to do.

 I want to mention one more thing. As I watched to film I thought what if the movie is all dream and everything started to occure right when one of the women got their abortion. What if the movie is about the guilt she felt over the act. There's something else to think about.

 Bottom-line Simply not only one of the greatest films Ingmar Bergman ever made but one of the greatest films of all time. The performances are as powerful as in any other Bergman film. The movie doesn't seem to miss a step. Behind 'Wild Strawberries' this is my favorite Bergman film.",1116633600,4,4579,4.437425506555424

I would have rewound the tape, but was tired and ready for this project to come to an end. How can so many people like this?! What about a story for crying out loud?!

419697,4,630204135X,"Persona (1966)

 Bergman's Persona begins with many seemingly random images, including an eye being removed from its socket, a child crying, an erect penis and an animal being slaughtered.  The first three minutes of the film is a jumbled, cluttered and fast-paced sequence that appears to have no continuity whatsoever.  The genius of Bergman, as a masterful ""auteur,"" is revealed as many of these same images conclude the film, only now they clearly have a significant meaning to the action of the film.  Bergman's ability to symbolize abstract concepts such as loneliness, abortion, rage and sadness in this confusing sequence clearly depicts film as art.  Persona, technically, visually and symbolically demonstrates the ability for film to be seen as a form of art.

 Throughout the film, Bergman uses many symbols to show the progression of the relationship between Elizabeth and Sister Alma.  Twice in the film, Bergman visually shows how Alma and Elizabeth have switched roles.  The ""overlap"" between the two women is first seen when Elizabeth enters Alma's room while she is asleep.  As Elizabeth is about to exit the bedroom, Alma jolts out of her bed and embraces Elizabeth.  As the two sit side-by-side, they embrace, as Elizabeth physically crosses her head over Alma's far shoulder.  The same sequence occurs toward the latter part of the film.  From these identical scenes, it is easy for one to conclude that Alma has become Elizabeth.  Alma and Elizabeth have switched roles; Alma has become the one needing help and Elizabeth appears to be the silent, yet attentive listener.  As we see later, the roles have changed when Elizabeth writes to the doctor that she has been ""studying"" Alma.  The most significant role-reversal between the two occurs when Alma has sex with Elizabeth's blind husband and pretends to be Elizabeth.  Yet, it is the image of the two beautiful  women intertwined that seem to describe the complexities of their relationship much more appropriately than Alma making love to Elizabeth's husband.

 The film visually shows us the emotions and mind-sets of the main characters.  In the opening sequence, Elizabeth is seen lying in a room that resembles a morgue.  There is no movement or sound (diagetic nor non-diagetic) and everything in the room appears dead.  It is quite startling when Elizabeth suddenly opens her eyes, as if she is suddenly awoken from a horrible dream.  She appears terrified and at the same time lifeless.  She does not make a sound, nor does she utter more than a couple sentences in the entirety of the film.  This one scene shows that Elizabeth is terrified as if she is keeping a secret.  The secret that is later revealed, not by Elizabeth but by Alma shows that Elizabeth has feared motherhood and it has caused her to become a mute.

 The film is largely about identity roles and how we perceive each other.  Bergman creates these unbelievable scenes that force us to question reality and how we perceive reality.  He also uses misrepresentations to depict false perceptions.  Initially, Alma believes that Elizabeth is good-natured and sincerely interested in her difficulties.  As the film plays out, we see that Alma's perceptions are wrong and that Elizabeth is in fact using her.  It seems as if Bergman is saying that it is truly impossible to really know someone else.  Our own projections, however false they may be, are largely the only way we think we know a person.  Bergman's most significant message of Persona tragically shows our inability to truly know anyone else from ourselves.",1110153600,,3568,5.006802721088436

 I just watched this film again tonight -- we're blessed with a Bergman festival here in Washington, DC just now (July 2004). I watched it as a quasi-double bill with Through a Glass Darkly -- another movie, like this one, in which Bibi Andersson goes mad. Yet two completely different performances, portraying different-seeming women.

 In this one, as the other plot summaries state, Andersson nurses an actress played by Liv Ullmann who decides to stop talking. Andersson takes that silence as a cue to start talking herself, opening up about herself and the sins of her past. Like so many other serious sixties movies, this one toys with the idea of who is the sane one.

 You should pick your friends carefully and Ullmann proves maybe not Andersson's best bet. Let's not give away too much about what happens, but like so many Bergman pictures this is about whether any two people can truly know each other -- whether you can know the person you're talking to and living with, or whether you only know a mask that person is wearing. Ullmann and Andersson are made up to look very much alike, lending an overt touch to the idea that their personalities are somehow merging or overlapping as they explore themselves through their interactions with each other.

They were right, for I was completely blown away by this Bergman masterpiece.  'Persona' is a powerhouse of emotions, and the acting is superb.  Liv Ullmann's silence is extremely compelling, for her nonverbal communication conveys a whole lot more than any dialogue could relate!

This movie was shot on the island of Fr (Bergman's residence for the past 40 years,) by cinematographer Sven Nykvist, who had been Bergman's regularly used cinematographer for all his movies since ""Jungfrukllan"" a.k.a. ""The Virgin Spring"" (1960). ""Persona"" tells the story of actress Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann,) who has chosen muteness, and her nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson,) who observes her, keeps her company, and is trying to ""cure"" her while they live together in the archipelago during the summer. As always both these actresses do convincing jobs. This was Liv Ullmann's first appearance in a Bergman movie (it lead to a relationship between her and the director,) while Bibi Andersson had been reoccurring in Bergman's movies since ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" (1955).
MGM's presentation is less than professional. They have presented the movie in Aspect Ratio 1.33:1 instead of Original Aspect Ratio 1.37:1! MGM have announced that they are not going to correct this mistake.

419784,5,630204135X,"""Persona"" is the equivalent of cinematic poetry, and like many poems, it relies on striking visual imagery and symbolism to convey its meaning (or meaninglessness) rather than the conventional, linear narative of most films. While hauntingly beautiful, ""Persona"" is clearly open to interpretation, as many great poems are. The film is a frustrating, paradoxical enigma, but leaves the viewer breathless with its dazzling images and thought provoking ""silences"".
The paradox at the heart of the film involves the together yet separate place in which these two women find themselves. How can two people, two personalities, two entities be so merged yet so apart?
On a universal level, one could venture that the two women represent the ever-present duality in both man and nature; forces that are inter-related, yet so separate from each other: good vs. evil, the belief in God vs. the meaninglessness of existence (or as Aristotle might have phrased it: creation in time vs. the eternity of the universe) or love vs hate (among the many dueling dualities in the universe). The reason that these two women can never really merge is that the universal battling of conflicting forces could never allow it. Confliciting forces will always be separate, as hard as they try to connect or compromise.
On a personal level, the two women represent the vast abyss that separates one person from the other. As hard as we try to understand each other, the human psyche is a nearly inpenatrable puzzle that defies trite pschological categories. Because life is basically a stage, we are forced to play roles that are set up by other's expectations, fears and desires that don't necessarily reflect our true selves. The camera is always on, as the film implies, and we are are rarely free to be ouselves,if we are even able to discern who we are underneath the many masks that we wear. We are like ""marionettes"" with others pulling the strings of our personalities for us. For Bergmann, it seems, all relationships (husband/wife, parent/child, etc.) are doomed to failure. No matter how close we are able to get to each other, we will always be separate, with false and misleading notions (that we have created ouselves) of who the other person is.
From the above discussion, it is clear that the film is enormously complex. (I have not even begun to touch on all the elements of the film- that would take volumes.) Almost any other interpretation of the film would be equally valid. That is the daunting challenge and huge joy of this film. The meaning of beautifully symbolic poetry is often hard to penetrate. The effort, however, is worth it, so that we may learn about ourselves, about our relationship to others, and about our relationship to the universal forces.",1046563200,16,2755,4.952483801295896
419785,5,630204135X,"This is a truly outstanding film.  After viewing this film one is much more confused than before seeing it.  Of course, the interest in the film is to be able to say what it is about.
This is a truly philosophical film, especially existentialist in a Sartrean fashion, in which the self is in dialogue with itself.  It is difficult to say if there are two women in the film talking to each other, or just one woman talking to her own self (conscience).
I also think the film is about the inadequacy to conceptually represent that which happens at the consciousness level that can only be shown.  This is quite likely the reason we just cannot say what this film is about.
This film is a true work of art that will have that status for centuries to come.",1046304000,5,753,4.357142857142857
419786,5,630204135X,"MGM has a much better transfer, and more user-friendly subtitles.  The most famous shot of the movie (shows up on the box cover of both versions) barely even shows up in the other version.  Short of a much-anticipated DVD release of this, the MGM version at least tries to come close.  A movie of this kind of beauty doesn't deserve any less than optimal viewing conditions.  If you are a Bergman buff or something, though, you might get both editions to compare and contrast (e.g., the subtitle content).  (Please note, folks: the average rating of this has been dragged down by low votes for the non-MGM version; I think almost all agree that the film itself is a 5-star affair.)",1045785600,3,681,4.641666666666667
419787,5,630204135X,"Another masterpiece from Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, this dark psychological study of two woman undergoing an existential crisis, is renown for great acting, directing, and a great script. Alma is a nurse assigned to watch Elizabeth, an actress who will not speak even though neither physically or mentally ill, at a beach house isolated from the hectic city. At first Alma gets along very well with Elizabeth who seems to listen to her, and her problems as she talks about her past and ideas of life. But soon, Alma see Elizabeth's dark nature, and is even more disturbed to find how similar she herself is to Elizabeth.
This film is great, winning awards for both actresses, and for the direction by Ingmar Bergman. The style is very experimental, and always presents itself to let you know it is a film you are watching. There is a lot of difficult topics in this, and Bergman, and the two actresses handle it wonderfully, presenting the ideas clearly and very effectively. The film's intriguing story sucks you in, and builds suspense in you. Even though you can understand the film with one viewing, multiple viewing will reveal more layers, and encourage discussion. If you enjoy serious films looking at existential topics, with psychological depth, I'd highly recommend you check this out. If non-conventional films with big concepts hurts your head, stay away. 5 stars.",1039651200,5,1383,4.991341991341991
419788,5,630204135X,"PERSONA may well be Ingmar Bergman's most complex film--yet, like many Bergman films, the story it tells is superficially simple.  Actress Elizabeth Volger has suddenly stopped speaking in what appears to be an effort to cease all communication with the external world.  She is taken to a hospital, where nurse Alma is assigned to care for her.  After some time, Elisabeth's doctor feels the hospital is of little use to her; the doctor accordingly lends her seaside home to Elisabeth, who goes there with Alma in attendance.  Although Elisabeth remains silent, the relationship between the women is a pleasant one--until a rainy day, too much alcohol, and Elisabeth's silence drives Alma into a series of highly charged personal revelations.

It is at this point that the film, which has already be super-saturated with complex visual imagery, begins to create an unnerving and deeply existential portrait of how we interpret others, how others interpret us, and the impact that these interpretations have upon both us and them.  What at first seemed fond glances and friendly gestures from the silent Elisabeth are now suddenly open to different interpretations, and Alma--feeling increasingly trapped by the silence--enters into a series of confrontations with her patient... but these confrontations have a dreamlike quality, and it becomes impossible to know if they are real or imagined--and if imagined, in which of the women's minds the fantasy occurs.

Ultimately, Bergman seems to be creating a situation in which we are forced to acknowledge that a great deal of what we believe we know about each other rests largely upon what we ourselves project upon them.  Elisabeth's face and its expressions become akin to a blank screen on which we see our own hopes, dreams, torments, and tragedies projected--while the person behind the face constantly eludes our understanding.  In this respect, the theme is remarkably well-suited to its medium: the blankness of the cinema screen with its flickering, endless shifting images that can be interpreted in infinite ways.

Bergman is exceptionally fortunate in his actresses here: both Liv Ullman as the silent Elisabeth and Bibi Anderson as the increasingly distraught Alma offer incredible performances that seem to encompass both what we know from the obvious surface and what we can never know that exists behind their individual masks.  Ullman has been justly praised for the power of her silence in this film, and it is difficult to imagine another actress who could carry off a role that must be performed entirely by ambigious implications.  Anderson is likewise remarkable, her increasing levels of emotional distress resounding like the waves upon the rocks at their seaside retreat.  And Bergman and his celebrated cinematographer Sven Nykvist fill the screen with a dreamlike quality that is constantly interrupted by unexpected images ranging from glimpses of silent films to a moment at which the celluloid appears to burn to images that merge Ullman and Anderson's faces into one.

As in many of his films, Bergman seems to be stating that we cannot know another person, and that our inability to know is our greatest tragedy.  But however the film is interpreted, it is a stunning and powerful achievement, one that will resonate with the viewer long after the film ends.  On a technical note, I recommend the MGM video release (and am astonished that the film is not available on DVD as yet); although the subtitles have moments of what is clearly poor translation, they are easy to read.  I cannot recommend this film too strongly.

419789,5,630204135X,"""Persona"" is by far one of the most complex films ever fabricated in cinema.  Like all Ingmar Bergman films, ""Persona"" challenges the viewer's thoughts of reason and reality.  Made in 1967, this still remains to this day, the most haunting and confusing film on self-identity and the duality we have as human beings.  Some might find the overlay of the movie too cynical maybe, but only because Bergman so purposely shows us our contradictory natures.  Both character leads played by Bergman regulars Liv Ullman and Bibi Anderson give stunning performances, as usual.  It's really amazing how well both women played such difficult roles, Ullman's character doesn't speak one line throughout the film and Anderson so captures all the different moods with an almost too realistic touch.  Recommended to only serious movie-goers, Bergman fans, art house, foreign film fans, and those who can handle disturbing commentaries on self reflection.",1023667200,9,939,5.3108108108108105

419791,5,630204135X,"PERSONA is everything a film should be - visually groundbreaking, thematically complex, and a deeply involving emotional experience.  The plot is almost laughably simple: A famous stage actress, Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) appears to have a nervous breakdown.  Unwilling to speak or even interact with others, she is sent to recuperate at the seaside home of her doctor in the care of a young nurse, Sister Alma (Bibi Andersson).  Over time, the talkative Alma becomes more and more obsessed with her famous patient, and resorts to emotional blackmail and even violence in her attempts to force Elisabeth to communicate with her.  Ultimately, the two women's identities seem to blur into one.  Driven nearly insane by her relationship with Elisabeth, Alma leaves her service.  It is impossible to overstate how complicated a viewing experience PERSONA is for the uninitiated spectator.  Both of the lead actresses are phenomenal.  Liv Ullmann delivers one of the most nuanced and complex cinematic performances in existence, despite having no more than one line of dialogue (or possibly two).  Bibi Andersson's interpretation of Alma is equally stunning - cool, calm and professional at first, then slowly descending into a whirlpool of self-doubt and then madness.  Characteristic of this film is its ambiguity - the viewer is forced think for themselves about the meaning of events and individual sequences, rather than being spoon-fed a series of definitive images, as in Hollywood movies.  Is Elisabeth actually ill, or is she merely selfish, acting yet another role to manipulate those around her?  Is Alma's mental breakdown the result of Elisabeth's treatment of her, or does she bring it on herself by using Elisabeth as a blank screen on which she projects her own fantasies?  The emotional and intellectual themes of the film - what is identity and how do other people play a role in our construction of our own personalities? - are perfectly balanced by an extraordinary cinematic style which foregrounds the illusory nature of the ""actions"" taking place in front of us.  Beginning with its opening montage, PERSONA explicitly reminds the viewer of its status as a fiction, and of the material process which transforms a set of still pictures into shadows with the illusion of life.  Within the body of the main narrative, certain sequences (such as Elisabeth's midnight visit to Alma's room) are structured so that we are unsure whether what we are watching is ""real"" or merely an hallucination on Alma's part - indeed, the entire last half of the film may be no more than Sister Alma's fantasies, but then again...PERSONA'S mystery and meaning are best expressed in an astonishing shot within the opening montage - a boy interrupts his reading and reaches towards the camera/audience.  A cut reverses the perspective, and we see the boy extending his arm to caress what seems to be a huge screen, on which colossal images of Andersson and Ullmann's faces appear, merge with one another, and disappear.  In this single sequence, Bergman amalgamates Woman and the Screen of the cinema, and the child seeking the embrace of the mother with the cinema audience.  PERSONA is one of the most unusual, even philosophical films ever made and it will certainly haunt your dreams as it haunts mine.",996796800,16,3304,5.098330241187384
419792,5,630204135X,"Someone who has read a biography of Ingmar Bergman would probably be able to offer an intelligent interpretation of this very personal film by the great Swedish director.  Since it stars his two most famous proteges, Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, and is an intense focus on their faces as though to look into their souls, and further since during the film their personas merge as one--given all this, perhaps it could be speculated that Bergman is suggesting that his perfect love would be a composite of the two.  Certainly part of the erotic power of this stunningly filmed masterwork (black and white cinematography by the gifted Sven Nykvist) is the evocative display of the two Swedish actresses, who were respectively, 30- and 26-years-old, when the film was made.  It is curious however that Bergman is very deliberate in downplaying their sexuality.  They are never coquettish, nor openly sexual.  Very little skin is exposed and that only incidentally.  It is their differing power as actresses that is explored with some, no doubt, deliberate and unavoidable revelation of their real life personalities.
I was particularly impressed with Bibi Andersson's performance.  She plays, Alma, a young and naive nurse who is called upon to help rehabilitate Liv Ullmann's Elisabeth Vogler, an actress who suddenly stopped talking.  Andersson has a beautiful and expressive voice that should be heard, so avoid a dubbed version (if it exists).  It is true that the subtitles are occasionally ungrammatical and full of typos (and at one point a misleading term is used to avoid a gross sexual expression), but it doesn't matter because everything is very clear; indeed one could view this without the subtitles and without knowing Swedish and still get a fair idea of what is going on.  Liv Ullmann is also brilliant in a part that has her on camera for most of the film but without a single speaking line!  Nurse Alma does all the talking and something curious happens.  She becomes the ""patient,"" spilling out the intimate details of her life while Elisabeth becomes in a sense the shrink, and a ""transference"" takes place.  This is no doubt a Bergman joke (he was no fan of psychotherapy), but it is also a statement about the power of silence.  Elisabeth stopped speaking during a performance of the Greek tragedy Electra, and of course we have all heard of the Electra Complex, the female equivalent of the Oedipus Complex so beloved of psychoanalytic theory.  However what Bergman's point here is, I have no idea.  I do know that in the last two Bergman films I have viewed, this and Autumn Sonata (1978) with Ingrid Bergman as a concert pianist, the star is a selfish woman who does not love her children.  Here, we have Alma tearing into Elisabeth with the accusation that she hates her son and wishes he was dead.  Since Ingmar Bergman both wrote and directed this film, one might reasonably ask what this has to do with the psyche of the master.  The fact that an older man makes love to both women is also grist for the mill of an autobiographical interpretation.
However, I am Against Interpretation in this case (although clearly a film like this cries out for it) and more in favor of experience.  A work of art can always be interpreted and sometimes should, but it is essential to first experience the work.  If I ever see this film again, and after reading up on the life and loves Ingmar Bergman, perhaps I will look for what Persona says about him.  Meanwhile, I am content to observe that this is an original work of art, and as always with Bergman, an emotionally draining experience.",994723200,12,3607,4.811993517017828

7820289,4,630204135X,"This film has an avant-garde introduction of about 5 minutes, two brief experimental sections in the middle, and a brief avant-garde ending.  It has excellent cinematography and sharply visible white subtitles on a black background.  The narrative refers to themes of existentialism, such as anxiety, nausea, nothingness, and authenticity.  Bergman's script says, ""Reality is diabolical...[with] unbearable pain.""  ""Persona"" means ""role,"" and this story is about an actress, Elizabet, who stops speaking in order to stop playing a role, in order to search for meaning and for her genuine self.  There is one very sexual monologue.  A shattering glass may symbolize Alma's shattering personality, and her leaving a piece of glass to cut Elizabet's foot presages Nurse Alma's physical attacks on her patient, Elizabet.  There's an enigmatic scene of Elizabet's husband having sex with Alma and calling Alma ""Elizabet"" repeatedly--all in front of Elizabet.  Similarly, the confusion of identities recurs when the two women's faces fuse into one.  A long monologue is immediately repeated from the opposite camera angle, but I don't understand how Alma could know so much information private to Elizabet.",1519171200,,1200,5.549450549450549
7820290,4,630204135X,"I've seen a few of Bergman's movies but I can safely say that this one is the most challenging to get into and yet is one of the more rewarding for the patient viewer willing to take repeated stabs at it.  I loved ""The Seventh Seal"" and the later ""Fanny & Alexander"" and I'm now getting to love ""Persona"" as well.  Having all 3 on Criterion helps too as the picture and sound qualities are excellent as one expects from any of their releases.  Also included is a 60-page booklet containing an essay on the film and an interview with the director.  This film challenges the viewer in a number of ways and questions our conceptions as to what film really is.  Do we consider the characters as is or metaphorically or what are we supposed to think?  The answer the director himself would probably say depends on you and how you wish to view this.  The part in the film where the film itself appears to disintegrate comes across as self-sabotage to me at first but then it seems to be the director giving me a hint on how to interpret this work.  Is he reminding me that this is just a film and so as actors simply portray roles or personas of others or of themselves for a time could all three people, the young man in the beginning, Liv and Bibi's characters all be the same person with different personas?  Is this all a dream or is anything actual?  It is this confusion and trying to figure this out for me is what makes this a great film that rewards repeated viewing as any classic film should.

For those who like to be challenged by film this one should certainly be in your video library.
