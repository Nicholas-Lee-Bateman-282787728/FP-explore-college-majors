8508814,3,B00008EY5T,If you can take the fact that Grady Tate keeps rushing and making everything feel uncomfortable then it's worth a listen. But I don't think they could hear one another that well. There is a nice hi-hat solo by Max Roach and Milt Jackson's Lover Man is excellent. But the big band did not have a chance to swing because of the awful way the rhythm section played. Bass and drums were NOT in the groove. Why did they release this? And Dizzy's antics got old real quick for me as great as he was in his day. To sum it up: A whole lot of great musicians struggling to make meaningful music together and showing just how not great they can be on an off night in difficult circumstances.,1427760000,,681,4.246153846153846
