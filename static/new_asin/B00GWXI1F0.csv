6122352,5,B00GWXI1F0,"Both television series, George Gently and Justified are intricately woven stories,
with thoughtfully realized characters, and genuine emotion.
I'm going to be writing a full length Riding Shotgun column on the]
George Gently series, but I just couldn't stand not seeing any reviews up
here on the extraordinary work being done by Martin Shaw (who owns this
role!) and complimented by Lee Ingleby, who has to walk a difficult and delicate
tightrope with his character John Bacchus.
Pick up this season on blu ray.
Or pick up any of the previous seasons.
They are immaculately preserved.

6122353,5,B00GWXI1F0,"If you're a GG fan, then there isn't anymore anyone can say about Season 6. Excellent ending (no spoiler alert here). Acting is superb, tho Shaw seemed a wee bit tired this season, he makes up for it in the finale. Does anything rile GG? Let's get over the deceased wife & give the guy a 'like' interest at least. Bacchus is awesome. Sometimes you just love to love him, or, love to hate him. His father is a jerk, but boy that ending is killer on the emotions - love the twists & turns of Baccus' life & Ingleby is just so perfect in this role. Get Season 6 is all I can really say. Excellent. Superb. Gently in His Element",1395619200,5,624,4.122950819672131
6122354,4,B00GWXI1F0,Will I get the wrong DVD if I order this?  The editorial review for this is wrong.  It is reviewing Vera Series 3 instead of George Gently Series 6. There is a mixup here.,1393459200,5,171,4.0
6122355,5,B00GWXI1F0,"This says Vera, Set 3, but the DVD is Gently George.  If you like the police drama during the 1960s in England, then this series is great.  There's no bloodshed.  Sometimes the accents are difficult to understand.  Fortunately, there are subtitles.",1390867200,15,248,4.975609756097561
6122356,5,B00GWXI1F0,"Dramatic HD cinematography. Packed suspense & cop action. 4 [cinema feature length] exciting episodes have different themes. Aristocrat family prejudice, racial conflict, revenge & greed each take a turn. Great adaptations of Alan Hunter crime novels, filmed in HD [great for Blu-ray fans.] All episodes show rural Durham England set in the year 1968. Fun period background music. I love all aspects of this copper series.

George Gently (Martin Shaw) is a fine copper, yet grieving widower of 4 years. His assistant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) displays a bit of a learning curve when it comes to correct police procedure. Together they get the job done, one way or another. This due has thrilled UK crime show fans since 2007 and a 2013 series is in production. Each season seems to get even better.
My favorite episode of all time is 2-Gently with Class, due to the music (see why below).

SDH SUBTITLES for this 6th series of 4 long feature episodes
1 Gently Between Lines
2 Blue for Bluebird
3 Gently Going Under
4 Gently from the Cold
George Gently series began well in 2007 and has raised the bar ever since. Competes in quality to Midsomer Murder, especially with the two-generational leading characters. Of course there is crime violence and blood, it is murder investigations, but suitable for older teens through adults.

6122357,5,B00GWXI1F0,"Martin Shaw is superb as a deeply intelligent and ethical police detective who has become fed-up with corruption at London's Met. Complex, honest, and stalwart, Inspector George Gently (Martin Shaw) is a veteran of World War II who had happily married his lovely Italian bride. After witnessing her murder in ""Series One,"" the grieving Gently seeks refuge in the North East. Shaw is masterful, powerfully depicting a man with deep integrity and convictions, and a talent for boxing. Those of you who enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera/dp/B0050N0US4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera</a>&nbsp;are in for a treat. Filmed in England's starkly beautiful North Country, and historic city of Durham, this vivid series boasts high-production values, and authentically recreates the ambiguous, and at times disturbing, era of the late 1960s.

Series Five ended on a disturbing note, a cliffhanger, where the fate of our main characters was unsure. Veteran cop George Gently mentors Detective Sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby), a young fellow whose morals run adrift amidst the swirling social turmoil of the 1960s. As Gently's ambitious sidekick, Ingleby inhabits his character perfectly. You may recall Ingleby's inimitable turn in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban/dp/B000W796OM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban </a>, as the Knight Bus conductor, Stan Shunpike.

Series Six resumes in 1969, several months after Gently and Bacchus were brutally shot admit the majestic Durham Cathedral. This encounter nearly claimed their lives, and both suffer post-traumatic stress, along with physical scars. Poor Bacchus is still recuperating in a police convalescent home

Each mystery is feature-length at 89 minutes. Thankfully, there are English subtitles, for those of who do not want to miss one word. For a three-dimensional taste experience, you may want to indulge in some Northumberland style bangers & mash, with a classic Newcastle Nut Brown Ale (a favorite of Bacchus') to top it off. Enjoy!

""Gently Between the Lines""
Gently is shocked to receive Bacchus's resignation, as the sergeant is suffering PTSD after the shooting (in the last season). Although Gently seems to accept the young man's notice, he insists that Bacchus help with another murder investigation. After rioters were arrested after Newcastle police tried to clear a poor neighborhood out, prior to demolition and redevelopment, one of the protesters is found dead in the cells the next morning. The case causes both Gently and Bacchus to examine their role as police officers, during a time when law enforcement changed from being seen as locally based, to being thuggish agents of the state. Young policewoman Rachel Coles (Lisa Mcgrillis) is wrongly fired from the force - just wait and see what our George makes of that! Written by Tim Prager; cast includes: Robert Pugh, Steve Evets, Ruth Gemmell, Matt Stokoe and Caroline O'Neill.

""Blue for Bluebird""
This mystery is written by Jess Williams, of the marvelous series ""Call The Midwife."" Personally, I tend to dislike mysteries set in coastal holiday camps, and this one features dreadful clown faces. A beautiful young ""Bluebird"" from the camp washes ashore. Under all the camp's revelry and playful permissiveness, Gently and Bacchus expose a web of greed and jealousy. PC Rachel Coles (Lisa Mcgrillis) assists the team, while Bacchus fights to see more of his daughter. Guest stars include: Lee Boardman, and Pixie Lott.

""Gently From the Cold""
As often is the case in murder investigations, cases connect in ways not anticipated. From a murder in a sauna, the case moves Gently to investigate the possibility of military abuse. He finds himself actually facing a wall of silence and Cold War conspiracy. Written by Jess Williams; guest stars include: Jemma Redgrave and Helen Coverdale.

""Gently Going Under""
The best mystery of the lot, with wonderful developments in the relationships between Gently, Bacchus, and newcomer Coles (Lisa Mcgrillis). During the late 1960s, massive economic shifts pressure communities in the North. As Northumberland's coal mining industry suffers, stress grows in tightly knit mining communities. In Burnsend, a body is found in the mine, and Gently and Bacchus must unearth the truth beneath the community's tensions. In this beleaguered community, schisms and ill-feelings there date back to World War II. Though WWII may seem distant now, in 1969, it had only been over 24 years. To make a contemporary comparison, many of us recall the 1980s up to 1990 quite vividly. Time is relative, and memory collapses intervening years quite effectively. Written by Mike Cullen (the great Scottish series ""Taggart""); guest stars include: Grant Crookes, Neil Eddy, and Poppy Lee Friar.

While you wait for more George, there is another wonderful mystery series set in Northumbria, worth savoring. Based upon novels by Ann Cleeves (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crow-Trap/dp/0330518704/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crow Trap</a>), the series features the great Brenda Blethyn as caustic DCI Vera Stanhope:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera/dp/B0050N0US4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera-Set-2/dp/B008OTTTP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera: Set 2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera-Set-3/dp/B00GAXASK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera, Set 3</a>&nbsp;(to be released).

6122518,5,B00GWXI1F0,"Frankly, through 6 seasons I haven't been able to figure out if I'm in love with Martin Shaw, or George Gently.  Whether one, or the other, it doesn't matter because this is a brilliant series. As is often the case with British TV, the main characters are developed and grow over time. They are far more than stereotypes.  If I had more time, I'd write more, but let me just say that Series 6 continues to intrigue, provoke deep thinking, and engage this viewer. From Series 1, ""Gently"" has explored the social dynamics of the time, which includes, for example, an examination of the impact of immigration from the ""colonies"" on the social fabric of the English mindset. Also, Gently wonderfully handles ""classism-social stratification"" from the gentry with a stern grace that can only delight the heart of any who finds the concept of Lords' and Ladies', Dukes' and Duchesses' inbred sense of entitlement repugnant.",1447113600,,916,4.903225806451613

Bacchus is scraggy longer haired, talked into not leaving the force by Gently to pursue the hard to guess perps in this series. Gently somewhat harsh approach to Bacchus is only more endearing knowing he really likes him And he finally reveals why he's been a short fused inspector.. And a female copper irritating John with her detailed work ethic is again endearing with the feeling he likes her. this cat n mouse combined with great camera work make this entire series worth watching . and one spoiler alert Gently as advised by his Superiors to take a traffic gig, refuses to quit his present job, because this  is what they do!",1438387200,,757,4.69172932330827

6122728,5,B00GWXI1F0,"George Gently manages to be different. On the surface, it is similar: set in the 1960s, with a younger, more foolish detective assisting him.

How is it different?

Brilliantly written, but not dwelling on witty one-liners, the characters are believable. Neither is perfect, but clearly, Inspector George Gently holds a higher moral and ethical standard than Detective Sergeant John Bacchus.

The cases themselves are ordinary enough -- usually murder with some interesting nuances. As it is set in the 1960s, the writers draw from the era for issues, police procedures and cultural milieu. While they aren't in the thick of protests and court cases, they are impacted from a distance just as anyone was then.

As is typical of British TV that makes it to the States, production values are high. Each episode is much like a movie, not rushing through plot points. The relationship between Gently and Bacchus develops show by show, never beyond the reality of each character. The viewer is always left satisfied by the show's end, waiting impatiently for the next one to be released.

I fully recommend George Gently.

6122789,5,B00GWXI1F0,"This just might be the best police procedural ever done in any media, in any country. The stories are solid, without gaping holes. People act like... people. And the acting is astoundingly good. The real story in the George Gently series is not the crimes and the criminals, but the changing social setting, and the personal growth and change of the main characters. Martin Shaw is excellent, but to me, the real standout is Lee Ingleby, whose John Bacchus begins as a cocksure young policeman and goes through a series of changes as he encounters various life-changing and threatening events under the tutelage of Gently.

Season 5 ended with the lives of Gently and Bacchus hanging by a thread, with the suggestion that they were dying; I was doubtful that the producers could follow up that brilliant final episode with something worthy, rather than a deus ex machine with our heroes plucked form the jaws of death.

6122815,4,B00GWXI1F0,"Martin Shaw as Chief Inspector George Gently is similar in a lot of ways to the equally fictional DCI Christopher Foyle.  Both are superb detectives and deeply ethical men who are widowers.  The difference between ""George Gently"" and ""Foyle's War"" is of course the time setting.  Gently is set in the 1960s (although I imagine we're going to see the 1970s too since this set was set in 1969).  Picking this time period was a stroke of genius because it must have been very tough to be a copper in a time of tremendous social upheaval and all kinds of new crime.

The main selling point of the show is Shaw and Lee Ingelby, as Gently's ""bagman"" Detective Sergeant John Bacchus.  Both do an outstanding job of bringing their characters to life.  My only criticism of the way their characters are drawn is sometimes Gently comes across as a bit too progressive to be an old time copper in 1960s Britain and sometimes Bacchus comes across as a little thick.

As far as the episodes go, I liked ""Gently Between the Lines"" and ""Blue Bird"" the best.  Both of them were very believable (the first being an investigation of a death in police custody after a riot and the second being a murder taking place at a holiday camp).

I didn't like ""Gently with Honor"" all that much...

<spoilers>

Frankly, the whole thing came across as wildly implausible.  How believable is it that someone would commit a murder in front of a rolling camera and then not make sure the film of him committing such a terrible crime was destroyed?  After all, this was the 1960s, people couldn't just make a quick copy of something like that on their computer and post it to the Internet.

Also, I couldn't help but think that the whole plot of the British Army drugging squaddies with LSD and then torturing them to see if they could use such techniques on the Russians smacked more of a plot out of the ""X-Files"" than reality.  I also could have done without the whole angle of the soldiers in question being gay and being forced to reveal that by the ""evil British Army officer.""  The whole thing smacked of political correctness.

<end spoilers?

The final episode in the set ""Gently Going Under"" was a good one but not quite as good as the the first two.  The setting for the murder --deep in a coal mine-- was pretty creative, but the complex family relationships that were critical to the story were a bit confusing, and I could have used a scene where someone explained the whole thing to make sure we all understood what was going on.

This being said, I will look forward to the next set of Gently stories.  One major development in the late 1960s and early 1970s that I hope they use in a future story is Northern Ireland.  In 1969, the whole place went up in flames and by 1972, Belfast was like a war zone.  It would cool to see Gently and Bacchus deal with some of the spillover that took place in the Home Islands.",1403913600,,2896,4.461977186311787

6122821,5,B00GWXI1F0,"Season six (6) of this superb British ""murder-mystery"" series, ""George Gently"", finds our two late 1960's era detectives being challenged by a changing world (i.e. the questioning of authority, women asserting themselves especially in the ""work-place""-- much to detective Bacchus' chagrin,  sex being a more ""open"" and talked about topic, etc.).

 Once again Season Six (6), of ""George Gently"" is greatly written, directed and, most of all, acted.  Mellow-voiced Martin Shaw, as George Gently is superb as a very wise and caring detective guiding and advising his rather ""rough around the edges"" partner Detective Sergeant John Bacchus (wonderfully acted by Lee Ingleby);  Baccus really needs a tremendous amount of guidance from Shaw both personally and professionally. (In Season Six (6) Bacchus seems to mature but is still very rough--there were times that I felt like smacking him!)

Series six (6) is, of course, void of any of the technological help to our detectives such as computers with Gently and Bacchus having to rely on basic  ""foot-work"" in solving some splendidly written  and directed mysteries involving murder in a Turkish bath, murder in coal mine, very young prostitution, military torture, civil unrest, police brutality,  etc.  They solve the cases most brilliantly; I was on the ""edge of my seat"" through all four episodes that are each well over an hour in length.

6122884,5,B00GWXI1F0,"GEORGE GENTLY is a British television series that debuted in 2007 on the BBC.  The crime/drama/British mystery production has aired on PBS stations in the United States.  Series 6 is now released. The show centers on Chief Inspector George Gently, one of the few good men at Scotland Yard, and an old school copper. On the eve of his retirement, the world-weary cop decides to pursue one final murder case, suspecting that it was done by a gangster who's already gotten away with the murder of Gently's own wife. So, as played by the sixty-something Tony nominated Martin Shaw, Gently relocates to Northumberland, in the North East of England, tucked in just below Hadrian's Wall, a relic of the Roman occupation of Britain a millennium or so ago.  Gently takes on a headstrong sidekick (Lee Ingleby); starts solving murders in a time of profound change: the 1960s. The series is based on Alan Hunter's novels.  In DVD format, there is a 4-disc boxed set, running approximately 369 minutes, plus some bonus footage of behind the scenes footage, text interviews with the cast, 1969 facts, and photo gallery. (In Blu-Ray format, there are 2 discs.)  And, praises be, thanks to RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, subtitles.  Or how would anyone on this side of the pond understand a word of the local dialect?

The 6th series consists of four powerful feature length episodes, one to a disk. It opens as Gently,(Martin Shaw, THE PROFESSIONALS, JUDGE JOHN DEED, THE CHIEF, DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS) and his ambitious undisciplined Sergeant John Bacchus ( Lee Ingleby, THE STREET, PLACE OF EXECUTION), who married his boss's daughter, return to the job. They were gravely injured in the line of duty six months earlier. Both officers appear to be on the mend, at least physically.  But, while Gently is determined to put the horror behind him, Bacchus is not, and has shocked his boss by submitting a letter of resignation.  The episodes, to quote RLJ/Acorn, are:

Disc 1
Episode 1: Gently between the Lines
Gently investigates a death in police custody--and insists that Bacchus assist him, even though his sergeant has just submitted his formal resignation. In the process, the inspector has to tread a careful path between fellow officers who are closing ranks in support of each other and a local population grown increasingly hostile towards the police.

Disc 2
Episode 2: Blue for Bluebird
The body of a young woman washed up on the beach turns the attentions of Gently and Bacchus to the nearby holiday camp where she worked. The once-thriving business is clearly in trouble, with fewer and fewer families visiting each summer. The detectives discover the lengths to which some are prepared to go to keep the camp afloat.

Disc 3
Episode 3: Gently with Honour
When a man is beaten to death in a Turkish bath, suspicion falls on an ex-soldier with a history of mental instability. But the mystery deepens when a psychologist who had been treating the suspect hangs himself after leaving money to the soldier in his will. World War II veteran Gently finds himself investigating a murder that makes no sense and a military he no longer understands.

Disc 4
Episode 4: Gently Going Under
The death of a coal miner 800 feet underground presents logistical problems for Gently and Bacchus. More challenging still is figuring out which of the tensions and rivalries raging above the surface--between labor and management, in the local community, and among the members of the dead man's family--is a motive for murder.

Gently sometimes seems a bit of a fish out of water: he seems to spend less time fighting crime in bleak Durham County than battling racism, sexism, corruption and narrow-mindedness, often in the police department.  Where, when his colleagues aren't taking ""backhanders"" (bribes), they can  be found harassing or beating up their Arab, black, mentally or physically disabled or Pakistani neighbors.  In fact, the negative attitude of the series to  police work might make a viewer wonder just why the veteran cop ever joined the service, let alone stayed so long.  The viewer must assume it's his passion for justice.

A distinguished cast gives us uniformly fine acting.  Shaw, whom many viewers consider to be the best actor ever to play Adam Dalgleish in the televised versions of P.D. James' crime novels, has the chops and the gravitas to play Gently, and to carry the show.  He and Ingleby play off each other with warmth and humor.  Guest stars include Jemma Redgrave (BRAMWELL) and Robert Pugh (GAME OF THRONES).  Author Alan Hunter set his work in East Anglia, around Norfolk, where he grew up; however, the television series has been set in a more northerly latitude.  The production has been filmed around Durham and in Ireland.  The 1960s were, of course, a very eventful era: the tense political climate of the Cold War; then, attitudes and values begin to change as the Swinging Sixties belatedly hit the North East, a process the scripts show in fine detail.  The series is shot in high definition; scripts are witty and ingenious, direction is stylish.  Rural Britain - or is it Ireland--provides a beautiful backdrop for the action.  The series, which has been compared to FOYLES WAR  and MIDSOMER MURDERS,  offers many excellent reasons to love it, and I do.",1399593600,2,5276,4.927683615819209

I am waiting for series 7, which is in production now to be released.  This is one of the few copper shows that sets itself in the early 60's, then travels down the decade.  So many things happen,and so many ideas emerge in the plots.  These writers are GREAT!  I hope I can look forwad to many more series from this British great!",1397606400,3,444,4.226190476190476
6122905,5,B00GWXI1F0,"After the stunning cliffhanger at the end of Series 5, it is with great satisfaction to find that the four episodes of GEORGE GENTLY Series 6 maintain the same high standard of quality as the previous programs. Gently Between the Lines, the first of the new episodes, shows the aftermath of Gently and Bacchus respective recoveries. Gently, a war veteran, is able to take things in stride and move on, whereas Bacchus clearly suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and wants to leave the Force. This provides some immediate conflict between them.

The episode opens with a riot scene in which it is interesting to note there isn't a false moment to be found. Often in such scenes involving a lot of actors, the background performers can frequently be seen to be either over doing it or looking self-conscious. Such is the meticulous attention to detaila defining aspect of this seriesthat this is not the case. Every actor plays the sequence with the utmost conviction.

The attention to period detail (the series is now up to the year 1969) is completely convincing, including such bits of dialogue when a female police officer is called Pet, an example of 60s sexism, though interestingly in the series VERA, another Acorn Media release, Vera refers to almost everyone as Pet. This is a double standard, to be sure, but there you go.

After a young man dies in police custody, Gently and Bacchus must investigate to see if they can shed light on the situation, especially as it appears the young man may be linked to the severe injury of a police constable who was at the riot scene. Gentlys investigation is not appreciated by the local police, who feel the young man was responsible for the wounding of the constable and should not be given any special investigative consideration. Needless to say, there is more to the situation than meets the eye. The actual suspect is set up early on in the episode in a throwaway line of dialogue that is easy to miss. Such is the subtlety of the writing.

Of course, Bacchus must confront his fears to watch Gentlys back in the climax of the episode. This gets things back on track for the series to continue with their strained father/son relationship at the core.

The second episode, Blue for Bluebird, involves the murder of a young woman working at a family resort and involves the attempts of the resort owners to keep the investigation quiet (much like in JAWS). A charming 60s dance routine is the big set piece here. Its another involving, cleverly-plotted addition to the growing GEORGE GENTLY canon.

Gently with Honour is another excellent episode, this time centred around secret drug testing by the military. Bacchus is particularly caustic in many of his remarks, which provides some comic relief.

Some outstanding guest stars, particularly from Jemma Redgrave, make this episode arguably the best of Set 6.

Lastly, Gently Going Under involves a murder in a mining town and puts Gentlys life in great peril. With pressure from his superiors to transfer to a desk job, Gently remains determined to continue doing what he does best: solve crimes and catch the bad guys, whatever the cost.

GEORGE GENTLY is a great series. The powerful presence of Martin Shaw as Gently is the rock upon which the series is built, but he is matched all the way by Lee Inglebys Bacchus and a production team that spares no attention to detail. After six series the show still has legs. It will be interesting to see if the show continues at the end of the 60s or if it will cross over into the 1970s. In one of the excellent bonus extras Martin Shaw says he doesnt think the show will work set in the 70s. We shall see

Meantime, GEORGE GENTLY continues to enthrall as one of the best police dramas in the current marketplace.",1397433600,34,3771,4.726027397260274

Enjoyed all the stories and of course enjoyed the characters, Gently gets a hold of something and will not let go till he has his answers !!!!!!!!!!  Sometimes I want to smack his partner!!!!!!!!!!!  He needs to grow up and not be so disagreeable, angry with the world and thinking it and everyone is out to get him.  Gently does his best to guide him but OH no!!!!!!!!!!  THAT  is what makes the series so good is their relationship and the stories, they do get involved. Will be looking for 7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1397260800,2,586,4.533333333333333

6122909,5,B00GWXI1F0,"I like George Gently, and have series 15. I am, however, hesitant to buy Series 6 because of the price.

Both Series 5 and 6 are originally priced at $59.99. With Amazon price reductions, they are $23.90 and $49.30, respectively. Both series have four episodes.

So why is Series 6 $25.40 MORE than Series 5? Heck, you can get Series 14 (eleven discs total) for less than the four-disc Series 6!

Could someone explain the disparity in price? I will defer purchase until the price is reduced substantially.",1397001600,,506,4.7272727272727275
6122910,5,B00GWXI1F0,"What is better than a new season of George Gently on DVD, well a new season of George Gently on Blu-Ray of course!!  We are fans of this series that is set in the 1960's.  Sometimes a series in a specific period becomes more about the time and the politics than it does the characters, not so with George Gently.  The issues of the time are evident in the stories and in the attitudes, but these serve to enhance rather than take over the plot lines.  Season Six is phenomenal, with George Gently (Martin Shaw) and his sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) returning to duty after both being seriously hurt in the line of duty.  Remember this is the age before we recognized PTSD, and both men outwardly seem unscathed by their recent experiences.  Each deals with the aftermath of injury differently, and both seem a bit caught in the past in the changing world of policing and crime detection.  This is another fine series to add to our George Gently collection.  If you don't know this series, you are missing excellent television drama.",1397001600,,1038,4.603260869565218

One of the nice things is that no-one is perfect, it shows the flaws of the two main characters, as well as the society changes which were occurring. Stories are excellent, showing the workings of country settings, which are influenced by the flux of change from race relations and politics, all influenced by the changes occurring in 60's London .  This is one series I would recommend",1396224000,3,453,4.580246913580247

8628161,4,B00GWXI1F0,"The sixth season of ""George Gently"" takes place in 1969 as the counterculture movement gains momentum, and the 1960s are coming to a close. DCI George Gently (Martin Shaw) and DS John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) were both shot six months ago. Gently is back at work as the series opens, while Bacchus is recuperating at a convalescent home. As always, each episode touches on a social or political issue of the time: increasing distrust and hostility toward police, the decline of the post-War middle class lifestyle in favor of more worldly pursuits, the lengths to which the British government will go to compete with its Cold War adversaries, the coal mine closures. WPC Rachel Coles (Lisa McGrillis) joins the series as a super-efficient researcher and frequent object of Bacchus' scorn. Bacchus has been divorced for two years now and sports some serious sideburns. He's become more aggressive at taunting witnesses and suspects, while Gently is perhaps a little too accepting of social changes for a cop of the Great Generation, even if he is a fair and scrupulous person.

There are four 90-minute episodes:

""Gently Between the Lines"": Newcastle 1969. Police officers ordered to clear some empty homes for demolition are surprised by protesters who throw rocks at them. In the melee, Constable Michael Ashton sustains a serious head injury, and a vagrant thought to be a drug addict is arrested for the assault. When the vagrant is found dead in his cell the next morning by WPC Rachel Coles (Lisa McGrillis), DI Gently and DS Bacchus are assigned to investigate. It has been six months since both were shot in the process of uncovering a conspiracy of corrupt cops. Gently is back at work, but Bacchus declares that he no longer cares about anything and hands in his resignation letter. The dead man is found to be Simon Thomas (Paul Dingwall), who had been squatting in one of the empty houses and had both friends and enemies among his neighbors. His death while in custody causes the police officers who had contact with him to close ranks against the investigation.

""Blue for Bluebird"": The body of a young blond woman is found on the beach. DCI Gently thinks she was dumped from the end of the pier and drifted inward. The deceased was wearing the uniform of the nearby Bluebird Holiday Camp, a resort for vacationing families. Agnes (Emma Fielding) and Patrick (Sean Kenney) Webb identify the dead woman as their teenaged daughter Megan (Pixie Lott), who moved away from home two months earlier to launch a singing career at the Bluebird Camp. Gently and Bacchus go around in circles questioning Bluebird's owner Todd Stretch (Lee Boardman), his sister Cherry (Andrea Lowe), Megan's family, and her cabin-mates Justine (Jodie Comer) and Gail (Amelia Arnold) to come to the conclusion that the camp was in financial trouble. Meanwhile, Bacchus' frustration at only being able to see his daughter once a month puts him in a perpetually foul mood, which he takes out on WPC Coles, whom Gently has asked to join his team.

""Gently with Honour"": Redcar 1969. A young man named Scott Tanner (Oliver Johnstone) loses his senses and kills another man, Leonard Price (Steven Hamilton), in the steam room of a Turkish bath, ""like a wild animal,"" according to witnesses. The case seems clear-cut, but Tanner has disappeared, and his older brother Mark (Wiiliam Ash), with whom he lives, says that Scott doesn't have it in him. Mark is under the impression that Scott left the military because he wasn't tough enough. Scott's psychiatrist Stefan Lesley (Daniel Lapaine), to whom he was referred by the military, reiterates Scott's docile nature but refuses to turn over records without a warrant. Coincidentally or not- a colleague of Lesley's, Dr. Jennifer Bing (Jemma Redgrave), is employed at the secretive Hopewood military facility, where Scott was stationed and the MOD won't discuss. Bacchus continues feuding with WPC Coles, whom Gently entrusts with more responsibility.

""Gently Going Under"": Northumbria 1969. Arthur Hawkes (Ralph Ineson), coal miner and union shop leader, is found dead at the bottom of the Burns End Colliery, hit over the head and left to suffocate in the dust. Peter Turner (Simon Greenall) takes Gently and Bacchus down to see the body, where he and son Joe (Michael Socha) found it. The trip makes it obvious that Bacchus couldn't have followed his father's footsteps into the mines, as he is a touch claustrophobic. The mine is under consideration for closure, pitting the miners against management and providing the investigators with their first line of inquiry. When Gently and Bacchus interview Arthur's family, they find that he didn't get on well with his son Sam (Lewis Reeves) and didn't approve of his teenaged daughter Hannah (Poppy Lee Friar) dating Joe Turner. Gently's superiors, meanwhile, are trying to put him out to pasture by promoting him to Chief Superintendent in Traffic. And Bacchus is reluctant to take the inspector's exam.

The DVDs (Acorn Media 2004): Bonus features are short and spare. Disc 2: ""An Interview with Pixie Lott"" (2  min).
