8394635,5,B003D3Y6CO,Nice exposure to Tesla that helps offset the caricature of him often seen in popular media. Portrays the competition with Edison nicely.,1384905600,,136,5.2272727272727275
8394636,5,B003D3Y6CO,We were so glad to be able to purchase just this book instead of having to get the whole series. We were interested in the part about Tesla and are pleased with it.,1378080000,,164,4.0
8394637,5,B003D3Y6CO,What didn't Tesla foresee?  This video revels the many aspects of our modern technological life that owe some debt (large or small) to Tesla.,1365552000,2,141,4.875
8394638,5,B003D3Y6CO,Tesla was a wild and crazy guy!  I got this for my son to help him with a book report.  It did the job and gave him a little education too.,1355961600,2,139,3.4516129032258065
8394639,4,B003D3Y6CO,"Given I never knew much about Tesla, I would say this was a worthwhile buy.  Outside of that, much of what I learned a friend told me casually in a conversation.  There's a nice bunch of other information I, and he, never knew, so that was cool.  So I leave it to you to make up your own mind.  Are there better dvds out there?  I don't know, but I wouldn't have minded the price being a little lower - even though I am a bit stingy!  Overall, I'd say it was really cool though, check it out if you get the chance.",1350432000,,514,3.941747572815534
8394640,5,B003D3Y6CO,"I TEACH AT A LOCAL COLLEGE IN THE AREA OF ELECTRICITY, POWER DISTRIBUTION, SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY AND THIS IS AN EXCELLENT INTRO DVD TO SET THE STAGE FOR WHY THE MATERIAL THEY ARE LEARNING IS IMPORTANT.  IT IS WELL DONE AND HOLDS THEIR ATTENTION.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE ORIGINS OF OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY.",1324339200,2,329,4.655172413793103
8394641,5,B003D3Y6CO,"I'll make this review quite short but hopefully effective.  This is one of the BEST DVD'S  I've watched in years ! - - - and I'm not easy to please !  It's only approx. 47 minutes long, and TOTALLY interesting the entire time.  How many DVD's  (on any subject) can you say that about ?  I even purchased 3 more and sent it to 3 other people (and I'm not rich) - - - it just THAT GOOD !  People need to know  about Nikola Tesla, and all his contributions.  A definite 5 Stars in my opinion.

8394642,5,B003D3Y6CO,"I recently watched this video on the History Channel. Thought it would be a great addition for a unit on electricity that I teach to 8th graders. Tesla was a very smart man though a little odd. The only part I don't like about this video is when they show the elephant being electrocuted. It's only a short piece and I plan on fast forwarding that section when I show the video to my students. That piece really wasn't necessary. Even though I will skip that part I'm not sure if I will expand upon why I skipped it or not. It's gross and inhumane. However, it does provide some valuable learning if approached properly.",1281312000,12,620,4.4
