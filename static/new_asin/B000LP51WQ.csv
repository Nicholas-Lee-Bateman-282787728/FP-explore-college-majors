8162831,5,B000LP51WQ,"This is a very intriguing training video demonstrating weaving (interlinking) Bagua palm sets together with each other, and even weaving the same palm set back on itself repeatedly again and again. I had heard about Cheng style Bagua Zhang practicing this way and I am very glad to finally see it demonstrated and explained. Other than just the aerobic benefit of such training master Liu explains how the movements flow together smoothly. This is important because it develops fluidity and rhythm which are the keys to improving one's tactical speed.

Sequence
1. Brief history of Bagua
2. Full demonstration of the form.
3. Walk through explanation of each step and complementing palm technique very slow. Some of the techniques have an explanation how to weave it back on itself first to the left, then right, again left. This weaving is gradually speeded up in one continuous flow repeating the same few movements over and over again.

This method of training also seems to accentuate the way Bagua follows nature and our natural defensive instincts. Example: 8 basic ways to avoid an incoming strike: 1. Cover up with arms. 2. Push away forward. 3. Deflect vertically up or down. 4. Deflect horizontally left or right. 5. Twist body to absorb. 6. Spin body to deflect. 7. Shuffle step left or right to dodge. 8. Full step through to the left, right or back to evade. You can also see combinations of these 8 basics, like folding the arms to cover up and twisting the body at the same time to go with the force of the strike.",1294358400,6,1529,4.7443609022556394
