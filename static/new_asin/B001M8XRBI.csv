8320642,3,B001M8XRBI,"This DVD features the same episodes as Caillou's Winter Wonders.  I thought this was a new collection (it plays in English as well as French).  We didn't realize it was the same until we watched it, so now we can't return it!  Don't be fooled!  Didn't know how to rate it because it would be fine if I hadn't bought the other DVD.",1263513600,8,330,4.190476190476191
