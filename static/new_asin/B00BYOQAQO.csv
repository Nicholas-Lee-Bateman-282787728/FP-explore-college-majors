5682824,1,B00BYOQAQO,"Previous reviewer is correct.  Taylor does not wear blue jeans on stage and top is too trashy to be her.  Arms are too heavy to be Taylor.  Also, hair is completely wrong.

If you read the line at the bottom of cover ""unauthorized""...no kinding!  scam alert!",1316736000,9,258,4.521739130434782
5682825,3,B00BYOQAQO,"i know for sure that Taylor Swift would not wear something like that on stage. Not only that, but the guitar is not her style, nor would her hair be that short and straight, and would not turn her back on the camera.",1315612800,14,216,4.046511627906977

8575662,1,B00BYOQAQO,"Considering this is Unauthorized... no fan of Taylor Swift should put any money into such things.  The picture is not her on the cover, and in this case, I am judging by the cover.  Don't waste your money.",1318896000,,205,4.368421052631579
8575663,1,B00BYOQAQO,"There is no way that's Taylor on the cover seeing as she doesn't own a guitar like that, and wouldn't play one on stage. That's not even her hair. If the cover isn't even right, I can hardly see how the information inside it can be.",1318291200,4,232,4.065217391304348
