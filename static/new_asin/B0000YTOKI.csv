1959287,4,B0000YTOKI,...But still strong considering other films of its type.  I really liked DeVito's style as always.  His sense of humor and pacing is incredible.  Stiller and Barrymore deliver solid performances.  The real let down I had with the film was that I expected it to be funnier after how hilarious Death To Smoochy was...But in terms of it being critiqued on the merits of being a dark comedy it is one of the best in recent years that is for sure.  Devito has never made a bad movie directorially speaking as fas as I am concerned.  So far Hoffa and Smoochy are his masterpieces though.,1078358400,2,581,4.485714285714286
1959288,4,B0000YTOKI,"This movie has some great laughs and a great cast, not to mention it is directed by Danny DeVito! I was a little disappointed at Ben Stiller's performance and thought that he could have been funnier, but overall, I really liked this movie. Definitely one I will watch again and would recommend to friends! It's worth a watch.",1078272000,,325,4.620689655172414
1959289,2,B0000YTOKI,"Well so am I. I've always found his movies to be absolutely hilarious and when I saw the preview for 'Duplex', I was excited to see it. Unfortunately, this movie isn't as good as any of his movies. While the plot was decent, the movie seemed like it rushed through events kind of fast, the script wasn't exactly amazing, and as a whole, the movie just wasn't all that funny... Hopefully, 'Along Came Polly' will be better....",1074470400,2,425,4.532467532467533
1959290,5,B0000YTOKI,"Alex (Ben Stiller) and Nancy (Drew Barrymore) play a young couple with hopes of having their own home and starting a family.  The dream of owning a home becomes a reality when Realtor, Harvey Fierstein,  shows them a beautiful duplex in Brooklyn.  The duplex is everything they could have hoped for, especially since the second floor will make the perfect nursery, but there is one little problem... the elderly woman living on the second floor.  But, as Fierstein explains of the woman's age and failing health, Alex and Nancy decide they can live with the tenant while they try to get pregnant.
Upon moving in the building the elderly neighbor is sweet and kind, but things soon change.  Alex begins work on his new novel, complete with a short deadline, but his work day is constantly interrupted with requests by his neighbor.  Things escalate from bad to worse as the old woman's craziness spreads from affecting their home, to their jobs and eventually to the police station, as one cop takes a quick disliking to Alex and Nancy.  As the couple reach their breaking point they resort to drastic measures to get the old lady out and that's when the fun really begins.
`Duplex' is hysterical.  From start to finish the film is filled with twisted laughs leading to a surprise ending.  Most of the gags are side-splittingly funny, especially the Riverdance scene...I have not laughed this hard at a movie in a very long time.  Director Danny Devito has created a dark comedy that is a winning mix of `Throw Momma From The Train' and `Meet The Parents' with great performances from both Stiller and Barrymore.
Anyone looking for an original, funny comedy should look no further...'Duplex' is a winner!

The plot in theory, is not bad. But the story drags out forever. I ADORE Ben Stiller - but he essentially playing Greg Focker all over again here, same personality, same temper tantrums, same everything. Drew Barrymore is not a favorite of mine but she isn't awful. I barely made it through to the end without turning it off, it seemed endless.

They are too busy to deal with an ungrateful, presumptuous, spoiled brat of an elderly woman and she's not their responsibility anyway!

Stiller's part of the home is the downstairs portion, and it is gorgeous with the beautiful wood interior, built in bookcases, fireplace, and stained glass windows.  Perfect, right?  W-e-l-l, not exactly.

As you will quickly see, the little old lady turns out to be a royal pain.  She causes trouble one way or another and is slowly ruining their lives.  Meanwhile Stiller (the author) is trying despirately to meet his publisher's deadlines in a seemingly no-win situation.  They are stuck with the granny from Hades until she voluntarily moves, or dies.

Two married yuppies, (BEN STILLER and DREW BARRYMORE -- quite convincing as a devoted husband-and-wife), want to get rid of their rent-controlled tenant, (Ms. Elliss), so they can have enough room for their hoped-for child.  But Ms. Elliss does NOT want to move.  They try everything -- and more than everything.  You will find yourself chuckling, tittering, and groaning, (with delight, and with chagrin), as the antics and situations just keep coming, and just keep you laughing.  (Have you ever laughed whilst your mouth was frowning?  I don't remember ever doing so, but the incredible, comedic bad luck had by our two earst-while landlords had me doing so.)  This is slap-stick comedy with a delightfully modern twist.  The storyline is credible, the dialogue believable, (and often too-funny-and-clever for words to describe),
the acting quite good, and the direction -- by Danny de Vito -- seems to ooze the ""ha-ha-I-gotcha"" mentality that comes from a real-life of perhaps being put down in one's youth...............but triumphing, delightly, in the end with sucessful career, (and marriage), fame, and laughing, delighedly and deservedly, all the way to the bank! (Yay!)

The only thing that stuck me as wrong in this movie was the scene with the garbage disposal.  I don't believe garbage disposals were
legal in New York City until very recently....but I could be wrong here.

At any rate, however, this is a FUNNY film.  Funny, funny, funny, funny.....all the way through, from the very first to the very last scene.  A delight!  And it's wonderful to see a ""senior citizen"" (Ms. Elliss), take a leading role -- and a scene-stealing one as well.
Like KATIE JOHNSON, (aka: KATIE JANE JOHNSTON), the ""little old lady"" who stole so many scenes in 1955's ""THE LADYKILLERS""), Ms. Ellis shows how ""age cannot wither"" talent!  With an ageing baby-boomer population, romances involving the 70+ generation should come more and more into Vogue, I think!  In the meantime, enjoy 'DUPLEX'!

Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore are the perfunctory stars but the film belongs to Eileen Essell as Mrs. Connelly, the supposedly sweet little old lady whose actions wreak havoc in the lives of her confident yuppie landlords.

Barrymore and Stiller are looking for a bigger place because they eventually want to start a family. They found a terrific place in Brooklyn, but it comes with an elderly woman who lives in the upstairs apartment. They buy the building and become her new landlord.

The premise of the movie is that they want to try to get the old lady out of the apartment. Obviously she refuses and that's where the story really takes off.

What promises to be a friendly old lady soon becomes an annoyance. While Barrymore is at work as a graphic designer in a magazine, Stiller tries to enjoy his new office to finish his 2nd book. If he doesn't, the publisher will cancel his contract.

One thing after another follows Stiller and Barrymore until they seriously consider ending the life of their dear upstairs neighbor. The ending is very funny when all is revealed.

They are so endearing and convincing as a newly married couple.
It starts out that this young married couple are having a hard time finding the house of thier dreams in their price range. It seems almost too good to be true when they find a duplex near the big city life in Brooklyn, it is beautiful and spacious, and the downfall is that it comes with a very, VERY old woman who rents the upstairs apartment.

Because of a clause in her rental agreement, they cannot kick her out,but being that she is old, they figure she will die soon enough, So they buy the place and move in.

Suddenly the old lady seems healthy as a horse, and is a constant nuisance to them.
She keeps them awake all night with her blaring TV, Always bothering them for favors etc.
As things continue to go from bad to worse, they decide to have a hit on her, and hire a hit man to do it...Like everything else, that goes terribly wrong, too.

Great inherent likeability and comedic timing in any number of underappreciated movies.  So I was happy when I put this in my DVD player.

I was not happy almost immediately afterwards.  A hokey, painfully unfunny animated intro leads into a 20+ minute episode of ""House Hunters.""  Stiller and Barrymore spend almost 1/3 of the entire movie angsting about whether to buy some duplex in Brooklyn.  Come on - they needed to get in the house right away to get some comedy going.  That's just poor writing.  Instead of comedy, we get something you might see on HGTV or read about in the paper.

Once they move in, the elderly tenant upstairs is annoying.  She has brass band practice early in the morning and plays her TV too loud!  Ho, ho, ho!  It's funny!  Well, it's not, because it's so poorly written and directed that the supposed ""comedy"" just lies there like the DVD lies on the floor after you throw it there.

1959487,1,B0000YTOKI,"Probably the best effort from Danny DeVito as director would be 'Throw Momma from the Train' or 'The War of the Roses,' the latter being the ultimate battle of sex between Kathleen Turner and Micheal Douglas.  'Roses' was marred by occasional overdirection and presence of DeVito himself as lawyer, but certainly it was funny.  But those films were made back in the 80s, when he was in the prime.  With an exception of so-so 'Hoffa,' Danny DeVito has been doing the same pattern -- making comedies based on the battle between bickering characters.

Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore (who are also co-producers of the film) play a married couple moving into a duplex.  For the reasons I do not know and do not care, the old lady (who must be more than 80 years old) living in the upper room starts annoying them, making big noises in the middle of the night for starters.  The ""battle"" begins between the owners and the tennant (even the clever old lady has a nice trick of smiling before the young couple), and the more fierce the battle gets, the funnier the film becomes.  That's how DeVito must have thought.  Just like 15 years ago, in 'The War of the Roses.'

[JUST AWFUL] The results are awful mess, however.  Most of the situations are plain impossible; the stars are charmless; amd most of all, their bahaviors are not merely stupid, but predictable.  Ben Stiller does the same kind of character again, grumbling, always uptight and easily is persuaded to do something he never wants to do.  Drew Barrymore is nice and sweet to everyone, but her sweetness is there fot the director to make some goofy scenes later (like her 'funny' hair formed by 'electricity').  And veteran Eileen Essell, who, with all respect, is so hammy at times that I still am not sure she really thinks that this is not a comedy, but a serious BBC drama or something.  In short, she is devoid of the magic that is needed to make those potentially offensive characters charming to see.

In short, for the majority of the viewers, 'Duplex' is not funny; even by any standard of so-called dark humor, it is terribly unfunny and unpleasant to see.  I found his comedy style pretty funny back in the 80s, but obviously it's time he quit.  At least, as director.",1127952000,4,2236,4.620253164556962

Ben stiller and Drew Barrymore were told that the old lady upstairs is a sweet lady. She turns out to be their worst nightmare. They can't sleep at night, they can't have their privacy, she asks them to run errands for her all the time and gives them accusations that are not true, but then turn to be true because they had enough of it with her she was a pain in the neck, they really tried later to kill in any way they could think of but backfired, they even called for an assassin to murder her for them for 25 grand. They didn't have that kind of money so they sold everything they had in their apartment. And guess what, the assassin couldn't get her killed either. She is one tough Lady!!

In the end they sell their duplex to another couple, go upstairs to say good bye to her, and what do they find right after they sold their duplex, the old lady past away with natural causes. They sold the place and she dies. What a waste. But the fact is.. it turned out she was faking it, holding her breath. How did she get away with it. the man who sold them the house turned out to be the old ladies son. They have been playing on couples for a long time just to get their money.

This Movie is a little like ""throw momma off the train"" which is about an author writing a book trying to kill an old lady too but for someone .and the author ends up writing about the whole thing. This happens too in the duplex..Ben stiller in the role of the author ends up writing a book called ""Duplex"" and makes lots of money.",1122163200,4,1632,4.112852664576803

Unlike the monstrous Momma in Throw Momma From The Train, the elderly tenant in Duplex could almost be likeable, and she is certainly more believable (I'm sure most of us have met and eldster like this at some point in our lives). She seems to spend the whole film sublimely unaware of how annoying she is, and the actress (whoever she is) ought to be congratulated on how convincingly she played the part.

  As the film progresses we come to learn that she is the tenant from hell - and each new horror she foists upon Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore's Alex and Nancy confirms it all the more. Their desperate attempts to cope with her as she ratchets up the pressure are almost as hilarious as their ham-fisted attempts to do away with her. Obviously, they haven't got a chance because they are just too darn nice, and as a result, the old lady makes mincemeat of them in a series of almost Loony Toon style ""get the rabbit"" schemes. I half expected to see ACME on the side of some of the items in their arsenal.

  Ben Stiller was at his best playing his typical poor-downtrodden-loser part as he has done in almost every film since ""There's Something About Mary."" Drew Barrymore was actually likeable as the sweet always-look-on-the-bright-side wife.

  I'm not sure why this film got so many bad reviews. Myself, I was barely able to breath I was laughing so hard. By the end I was doubled over and my face hurt. I know that the film wasn't Shakespere, but it was a million times better than ""Along Came Polly"" which, for some reason, was given more playtime and seemed to be better accepted by moviegoers. I know there were a lot of scenes that had really vile content (chewed up sausages, rotting noodles, vomit and saturation sneezing) but it was all very tastefully done (in comparison to others I've seen) and for the most part really funny.

Why do I feel betrayed?

That means the ending didn't work for me as well, but there were some funny moments and I won't go into them because they were such a small speck on a dreadful experience for me.  I could tell when they were reaching for a laugh, a more appropriate word for this would be straining.  It's this straining that took me out of the film.  It could have been a straighead black comedy and tried to correctly work the emotions, but it doesn't and sidesteps it at the end.  As a result it was a ripoff, in my opinion.

Or so they think...for, unfortunately, the place also comes replete with what turns out to be the tenant from hell, a doddering old woman who lives on the second floor and who makes life miserable for the two of them with her continually blaring television and her constant intrusions into their daily lives.  Finally driven to the breaking point, Alex and Nancy decide to take matters into their own hands in order to rid themselves of this human pest in any way they can.

""Duplex"" is, essentially, a one-joke comedy and, as such, it does suffer from the occupational hazard common to all one-joke comedies of built-in repetitiousness.  However, the writing has a surprisingly dark edge to it that lifts the film above the run-of-the-Hollywood-comedy-mill.  I must confess to having a certain weakness for dotty old lady comedies, counting among my favorite films the original British classic ""The Lady killers"" from 1955.  Eileen Essel is so delightful as the bete noire of the piece that it's hard not to fall under the spell of both her character and the film itself.  De Vito, in a return to the black comedy form that served him so well in ""The War of the Roses,"" keeps the comedy tough and brutal, even if it means bludgeoning the audience over the head a bit in the process.  Stiller does his usual shtick as the put-upon Everyman, while Barrymore is able to use her customary cutesiness to full advantage as the sweet little ingenue driven to murder to save her own sanity.

""Duplex"" is certainly not everyone's cup of tea, and I imagine that it would not win the stamp of approval from the AARP.  Still, if you're in the market for something different in a mainstream comedy, ""Duplex"" just might fit the bill.",1106784000,12,2113,4.844444444444444

How far can the old woman go, and how long can Stiller and Barrymore hang on?  Lots of funny moments topped off by a delicious and ever-mounting anxiety.

1959522,3,B0000YTOKI,"***

This was not a great movie, but unlike other reviewers I did find it really funny.  Good performances by Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore help.

I almost didn't rent this movie because the notes on the DVD jacket describe two young people who want to kill their elderly tenant.  That idea was very offensive to me.  Instead, the movie is about the frustration of dealing with this difficult tenant, to the point that the young couple wishes they could kill her, and almost go crazy trying not to---a very different thing.  Everyone has probably felt frustration like this about one thing or another, and that's part of what makes the movie so funny---you can identify with things you've gone really nuts over.  Again, it is NOT a movie about an evil young couple tormenting a poor old lady!

I found Duplex funny, entertaining, and not offensive in any way.  Ben Stiller is a great comedian, and Drew Barrymore was perfect as his Pollyanna-like wife.  It's worth the rental, or buying it for a reasonable price from Amazon.

""Duplex"" was a very funny and entertaining film by Director Danny Devito. Devito's resume of films does read like a long list of mean spirited revenge films.  ""War of the Roses"",  is the one that sort of came to mind first, although in this case we have one couple (Stiller and Barrymore) working together to get rid of one nasty old lady. Critics panned the film calling it unreal and stupid, but that's the appeal. Its sort of like a twisted version of ""Home Alone"" except we have an old lady using various dirty tricks to get rid of her two attackers.

1959531,2,B0000YTOKI,"I flew to Seattle a few months ago, and this was the in-flight film. I was intrigued, as I had never heard of it, and I enjoy Ben Stiller's movies. Moreover, this one was directed by Danny DeVito, and I had loved what he did with ""The War of the Roses"". So, I settled down to watch what I thought might be a somewhat dark comedy. After watching it, I decided that this film was chosen for in-flight viewing, as the audience was a captive one and could not leave. Had I seen it in the theatre, I am sure I would have been witness to people leaving mid-film. To add insult to injury, this film was the same one shown on the return flight.

The plot is simple. A young couple, Alex and Nancy, buy their dream home, a large and lovely  apartment in a turn of the century brownstone in Brooklyn. Replete with period detail, they fall in love with it, probably paying more than they should. The good thing is that the price includes an upper apartment, which is also part of the deal and would convert their apartment into a duplex. The only caveat is that the upper apartment is rented by an ancient  crone, Mrs. Connelly, who pays under a hundred dollars a month in rent, as the apartment is rent controlled.

Still, they love the apartment so much that they buy it anyway, figuring that the tenant, whom they met, would not be there much longer due to her age and seeming ill health. Once they move in, however, Mrs. Connelly appears to have recovered her health and turns out to be quite an active and spry old woman who seems determined, in her own sweet way, to make the lives of the new owners a living hell on earth. Alex and Nancy hurry and scurry to meet their tenant's insatiable demands, which wreak havoc with their personal lives. This compels them to resort to various ways of getting her to move, all of which she seemingly resists without batting an eyelash. Finally, the harried, beleaguered couple is driven to seek a more permanent solution to their landlord/tenant problem.

The film was clearly meant to be a dark comedy. It was dark, alright, because most everyone associated with it seems to have lost their way, but there is nothing really comedic about it. Ben Stiller's performance is strained, as he must have recognized early on that this film was not particularly funny. Drew Barrymore sleepwalks through her role as if she were on thorazine to quell any potentially psychotic behavior should she realize the turkey of a film in which she was acting. Harvey Fierstein manages to be annoying in the small, but pivotal, role of the real estate agent, while Swoosie Kurtz plays her role straight, rather than for laughs, and manages to avoid personal embarrassment.  The only real saving  grace is the performance by veteran British television thespian, Eileen Essel, in the role of Mrs. Connelly. She is the only reason the film warranted a rating of even two stars. Ms. Essel, however, must surely have a contract out on her agent for inducing her to make her feature film debut in this flop.",1094860800,7,3015,4.551660516605166

1959533,4,B0000YTOKI,"This dark comedy is a barrel of laughs and worthy of more attention than it received.

Danny DeVito directs yet another great comedy frayed with darkness around its edges. He manages to create humor from characters that are struggling with their consequences. Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore are a young couple in search of more space to live in when they are sold a duplex by a slimy real estate agent, played by Harvey Fierstein. But the duplex comes with conditions that unfold as the movie progresses. Living above the young couple is an old Irish lady (brilliantly played by Eileen Essel) who creates all sorts of comedic havoc. Appearing sweet and innocently feeble she irritates and riles her landlords with the blare of her TV, constant calls for assistance and a many more silly moments that will leave you in stitches. The young couple is driven crazy and that only leads to additional antics well written and as funny as can be.

Stiller and Barrymore are perfectly cast as the young couple with Stiller stealing most of the scenes with his neurotic, paranoid and defensive acting. Just his facial expressions alone are enough to rob you of a few laughs. But the star of the movie is Eileen Essel who has an unending sense of humor and natural comedic energy that rivals Stiller's. Beside Essel is a macaw that adds a bit of animal life to the scenes and flaps about with additional value. Leave it to DeVito to add a bit of a dark twist at the end.

1959535,4,B0000YTOKI,"This is a comedy about a young couple who decides to buy a duplex just outside New York City.

She's the supportive wife going off to work at a magazine in NY. The little old woman is a very old widow.

During the course of the movie, the old woman continuously disturbs their sleep, destroys the writer's ability to finish his work, and generally disrupts the peace and tranquility they mistakenly thought they would attain with the purchase of the house.

What follows is a myriad of very entertaining, slapstick comedy and a murder plot. This movie is funny, but somehow just misses the mark.

I love black comedy as much as the next guy, but even in the whackiest of out-of-control black comedy plots the characters have to be believable. Plots require that characters do the unexpected; but the unexpected must be within character.
It's a fine line, something that DeVito dances along surperbly in ""The War of the Roses,"" but fumbles here. When Alex Rose (Ben Stiller) and Nancy Kendricks (Drew Berrymore) decide to kill their upstairs tenant - well, let's just say the idea of the two starry-eyed idealists sneaking around a Brooklyn apartment with murder on their mind feels patently ridiculous. They don't ""earn"" it. I just didn't buy it. And all the smothering, harpooning, and booby-trapping that follows.
Kendricks especially doesn't feel right because Berrymore is miscast. Stiller is perfect for the movie. He's excellent at characters who barely suppress rage. It makes sense Rose would snap. But Berrymore plays characters who are light and optimistic, despite all the bad things that have happened to her. It's that tension between her simplicity now and her dark, complex past that creates laughs (see ""Charlie's Angels"").
But it's the script that's the biggest failure. It feels like a pastiche of funny moments loosely based on an amusing premise. The scenes don't lead well into one another. It's stilted and unbelievable. It jolted me from the movie, made me aware I was watching a movie.

The story is of a young couple, a writer and a journalist moving into a duplex to start a new phase in their lives and try for a baby, but one thing they did not plan for is the tenant of their first floor who is not the sweet old lady she appears to be, and many accidents, disturbances and interferences ensue.
Ben Stiller is always wonderful to watch no matter how great or mediocre the film is, for he has this rare talent that reminds somehow of Peter Sellers in Pink Panther..His 'helpless' expressions and 'victim's face' has made many of his performances endearing.
Drew Barrymore, is very sweet and looked relaxed in her role, while Eileen Essel, the British TV theater actress in her first feature film, does a very good job and managed to play her character with a mixture of 'anyone's grandmother' and Tatie Danielle.
Danny DeVito is undoubtedly not a bad director, even if he has had mixed results so far, from the excellent War Of Roses, and Matilda, to the average and disappointing Death To Smoochy. Duplex I believe falls between the two, and this is maybe the problem of the film and hence my three stars,
There is something missing from the film..I don't know quite what it is, since there are many hilarious and disgustingly funny moments not quite out of place in a Farrelly Brothers movie, but I remained totally detached, unconnected and without much sympathy for any of the characters...When the credits role, you will not help feeling that the whole project lacked inspiration..

However, all comedians tend to have at least one movie that's fails to pay the bill on humor.  Richard Pryor has his with ""Superman III"", and Ben Stiller has his with ""Duplex"", a movie that made a mediocre comedy like ""Zoolander"" seems like ""Monty Python's Holy Grail"".
Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore were newlyweds who just owned a Duplex(surprised?) in the Brooklyn neighborhood.  There, it lived an old Irish woman on the upper level of the Duplex who's ""delighted"" to see new landlords.  Courtesies and friendly greetings aside, its looks as though the couple will get used to the easy life as Ben would finish his second novel and Drew would be a more out-going as both a wife and a decorator, but they haven't a clue that living with the nice old lady would eventually bring them hell.  The old lady starts asking Ben to help around her room while he was doing his novel in a strict deadline, fixing the bathroom pipes and consuming dozens of hours of escorting the lady to the pharmacy, counting prescribed pills.  Drew, later, takes his place to share the torture.  Exhausted and peeved, Ben eventually loses his book deal, Drew loses her job at some newsletter business, and since their troubles came from the old lady's ranting, they decided to off her for good.
This may sound like a good dark comedy by paper, but in its final product, this slapstick movie is really a punch in the face.  I found nothing funny about this movie.

There's little humor that I haven't seen already and the deliveries were spastic.  The one thing in that REALLY got my knickers in a twist is the ending of this movie, which I didn't see it coming, and all the better to breaks this movie in two.

1959579,1,B0000YTOKI,"My wife gave up on it after a half hour. I wanted to like it  (hey, I paid $4.00 to rent it) so I made it another half hour before turning it off. The script is awful and the film is an embarrasing mess.
Actually, when I was 12 I might have found the vomiting gags amusing. It's hard to imagine why Ben Stiller and Drew Barriemore were willing to stoop to these kinds of antics. I lost an hour I can never get back.",1079827200,5,415,3.8823529411764706
1959580,3,B0000YTOKI,"From out of nowhere comes ""Duplex"" a somewhat funny comedy directed by Danny DeVito, it stars Ben Siller and Drew Barrymore. This movie must of had a short life in theaters, because I never even knew of it to be on the big screen. Perhaps I blink'd and missed it. Anyway, I said it was somewhat funny a moment ago, let me explain. It was funny, but only a few scenes were laugh out loud funny. The movie as a whole was more of a crack a smile comedy with an edge. A dark (""wanna murder your sweet faced yet annoying Irish old lady neighbor"") kinda comedy with a dash of uninvited satire. If you're fans of Stiller or Barrymore the movie will most likely be more enjoyable than if you're not. I liked both stars and was on their side the whole time. I'm not going to go over the storyline for you, there are a number of other reviews that do that. I will recommend ""Duplex"" for a rainy afternoon movie.",1079740800,3,901,4.213872832369942
1959581,5,B0000YTOKI,"This is by no means a hollywood blockbuster, or deserving of an oscar, but a fun movie about a newlywed couple getting the house of their dreams, with the tenant from Hell. I recommend this movie!",1079395200,2,196,4.472222222222222
1959582,1,B0000YTOKI,"Please don't waste your time or your money on this movie.  Luckily, I did not wast my money in the movie theatre on this motion picture.  I didn't even waste my money at the movie rentals, but that's besides my point because I wasted my time.  If I could give this movie an infinite amount of negative stars, believe me I would.  Giving it one star is bad enough.  This movie shouldn't even be rewarded one star, let alone five.  What seems like a seemingly funny movie about a little old lady who gives her tenants hell turns out to give the viewer hell instead.  I laughed two times, but even then it was a forced laugh.  Sure it is funny when the little old lady is choking on a chocolate, or when a hit-man is hired to kill her off, but not funny enough to spend twenty dollars on.  There was no substance and a lack of humor, which I am disappointed about.  The old lady asking for help is just too much to handle.  If you have had to deal with living with an old grandma who wants her grandson to do everything for her, no matter what the task is or what the time is, then you pretty much have seen the movie and do not want to relive the experience.  If you are the type of person who gets irritated quickly, I strongly do not recommend this movie.  For all the people who give movies a chance, this is an exception.  If you want to see some real Ben Stiller comedy, rent Something About Mary and Meet the Parents.  Trust me, this movie was a waste of my time and don't let it be a waste of your money.",1079222400,5,1509,4.102389078498294

Thank you for putting a GOOD movie out that everyone could watch and not be embarrassed.",1079136000,3,214,4.35
1959584,2,B0000YTOKI,Not as cool as the hype.  There is a reason this went quickly to video without much hype. I like Devito and Stiller but this just was not that great of a comedy it was simply average and I expected more given all the prais reviewers have given it.,1078876800,2,247,4.040816326530612

ben stiller is great as is the old lady.  for anyone over 50
this film reminded me a bit of the 1955 alec guiness movie
""the ladykillers""
a thoroughly enjoyable movie",1078704000,2,218,4.45
1959587,3,B0000YTOKI,"Danny Devito seems to be stuck on the idea of making dark comedies of late. He's better at it than he gets credit for. Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore star as a couple who move to a Duplex that they love. There's just one problem, the old lady upstairs. She bugs them to do choirs for her, blasts her tv when they are trying to sleep. Just for those reasons the couple decide to kill her a little too quickly. There's a lot of scenes where they try and fail but I found them all pretty funny and one even extremely gross. Eileen Essell shines as the little old lady who drives the couple crazy. I think Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore shine as well and have better chemestry than they got credit for. The movie is basically the Money Trap meets Throw Momma from the Train. I think the actors make it work though because they work great together. Plus unlike the couple, you sorta love the old lady and not hate her. She totally steals the show.",1078358400,3,942,4.268156424581005
