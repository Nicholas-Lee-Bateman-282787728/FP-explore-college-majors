8049735,5,B0007OP1AI,"A fun movie with a lot of action and a great picture for Ward Bond. The picture is very good as is the sound. It is just another great old B/W movie worth watching. The plot is nothing new for the time this movie was made, but still fun with great action.",1418083200,2,255,3.923076923076923
8049736,5,B0007OP1AI,"Joseph Kane's ""Born to be Wild"" (1938) might look a little creaky today, but it's 64-minute running time is packed with non-stop action  from beginning to end with some good-natured humour thrown in. Truckies Ralph Byrd and Ward Bon battle capitalist robber barons to transport dynamite to a dam site in order to prevent a looming disaster. Maybe not exactly ""The Wages of Fear"", but it has some moments of genuine suspense. Script is by Nathanael West, the bloke who wrote ""The Day of the Locust"". Joseph Kane directs at a cracking pace.",1360368000,2,538,4.78494623655914
8049737,4,B0007OP1AI,"This is the original buddy movie played to perfection by Ralph Byrd and Ward Bond.  Ward missed his calling as a comic.  As a ""big byrd"" fan, I was so happy to see that Ralph proves he could also play comedy.  These guys really had good chemistry between them; so much so that easily, Republic should have put them into their own movie series.

The girl was cute too and not at all annoying.  Come to think of it, she held her own against Ralph and Ward.

Great story!  Ralph even sings a bit.  (I wonder if that was really his voice - anybody know?  If so, he was really multi talented.)

You gotta get this film.  It's a great entry in the Republic catalog.  And the Alpha print is great - for once.  This one's a keeper, a movie you take out once a year and enjoy.",1284076800,3,767,4.101351351351352
