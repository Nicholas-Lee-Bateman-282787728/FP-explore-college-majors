8341500,1,B001TIAUE8,"If you have seen the trailer, you have literally seen over 1/4 of the entire film and all of the good parts, at that. The total run time in about 15 minutes minus credits and intro. Not worth the price. There are other films about rooster fishing much better than this that are free on the internet. If you are looking to learn about fishing for roosters on the fly this is not the film to get, no educational value.",1483315200,,416,4.2125

8341502,5,B001TIAUE8,"this is a very short video, that is fairly professionally recorded.  I have a house in the East Cape area and this is exactly how it is.  Love to see this video when I am not there.",1402099200,,181,3.864864864864865
8341503,2,B001TIAUE8,"I watched this last night. It was over before I knew it started! When they started playing the credits, I thought it was the beginning of the film. This is really a joke. I paid $25 and the total run time is about 30 minutes.... or less. No content whatsoever. Just some hippie looking dudes (pathetically) running around the beach throwing unknown flies. A few questions for the film makers:
Why do (or should we) care about these people? A little character development would have been nice.
Who are they? What job does the fat guy have that allows him to do this (you reference it, but don't explain)?
A little background on the rooster fish would have been appreciated.
Why do we (or should we) even care about rooster fish? Can I eat them? Should I kill a few to find out?
Maybe more than one shot (not even a close up) of the flies you use.
How are you rigging your gear?
Why do you call the rooster fish ""the man?"" What's the reference?

I also highly doubt these guys were the first to ever catch a rooster fish from the beach on a fly as they claim. Sounds like a load of BS to me.

Nice scenes, but not worth the money. This is more like a teaser for a docudrama. Maybe a $5 film, but definitely not $25.",1380672000,,1213,4.224137931034483
8341504,3,B001TIAUE8,Problem is you can watch 3/4 of it on youtube so kind of felt ripped off paying for it. A bit too short of a video to have such long previews.,1373932800,,142,3.6129032258064515
8341505,5,B001TIAUE8,"This is a great film.  Fly Fishing films need to be short and to the point which this film is.  Too long they turn into the torture of watching a family home moive.  Too much fishing action and the film becomes boring.  This film has just the right balance.  This film has a great plot, interesting characaters and great cinematography.  If you are into fly fishing, you need to see this film!",1368748800,,393,4.388888888888889
8341506,1,B001TIAUE8,"Absolutely not worth it at all,  SAVE-YOUR-MONEY- if you saw the trailer, you saw the movie, period.

How this could be considered a ""film"" is beyond me

As a rule, a fishing film should last longer than it takes to tie a fly.

This is nothing more than a few clips from somebody's fishing trip.

No useful content what so ever.",1362182400,,328,4.311475409836065
8341507,2,B001TIAUE8,"I love fishing... and the idea of fishing for roosters from the beach with a flyrod is well changeling to say the least.  I had to get this.  I bought the dvd and looked for a film length but never did see one listed anyplace but figured it had to be 60 or 90 mins.  If you saw the ""trailer"" on YouTube...you saw the movie!  It can't be more then 5 or 10 mins longer than the trailer and to be frank, the trailer is better edited. There are some ""extras"" but you get another 4 or 5 mins of video.  I think this could have been a fantastic film, they had the right scene, great characters, ideal location...but this fell way short and is worth more like 5 bucks and not 24.95",1331337600,,674,4.037593984962406
8341508,4,B001TIAUE8,I'm going to honest about this video.  It's okay.  Looking back I most likely would buy it again but that's because I'm a fly fishing freak.  It's a decent movie and was fairly entertaining.  I recommend buying it but let all your friends borrow it.  If you are looking for a good Feltsoul media DVD get Eastern Rises.  Much better.  Although it is a unique DVD and focuses on fly fishing for Roosterfish.,1325030400,,405,4.465753424657534
