2561833,5,B000FDO09O,"I have done yoga before, but am definitely not very flexible.  I can actually do these poses and feel like I'm getting a good stetch, and it's not sooo challening that I feel totally sore the next day. I like walking and am even still running some on the days I don't do the yoga, and it's a great opportunity to do more stretching and toning than I would get otherwise. Sara is a great instructor and very easy to follow.  Unlike another reviewer who really liked the relaxation portion at the end, I tend to fast-forward through it...but over all I've really enjoyed it and I'm really motivated to do it because I feel like I'm doing something good for the growing baby!  It's nice that Sara has a new video for each trimester, because I'm just beginning to get excited about trying a new one!",1172620800,,795,4.394557823129252
2561834,3,B000FDO09O,"The poses were very easy, which is good for women not feeling well in the first trimester and can't handle having their heart rate above normal. For more experienced women or women feeling OK, it was too easy",1168300800,,208,4.5
2561835,5,B000FDO09O,"I have never done Yoga before, nor am i very flexible, so this video was the perfect challenge for me.  Knowing that the workout I am doing is good for my pregnancy and my baby is very calming to me.  i have been so afraid to do the wrong exercises since being pregnant.  While this DVD is relaxing, it was challenging enough to give me that feeling like i did a tough workout.  I also had a friend of mine do it with me who has done yoga before and is not pregnant and she loved the workout as well.  She said it was very relaxing to her and she felt like her muscles were challenged too.  So i am confident that all levels will enjoy this work-out.",1163980800,2,650,4.0390625
2561836,5,B000FDO09O,"I'm new to yoga, so I wasn't sure if I would like it or not but, boy was I wrong. The workout out was really relaxing and the poses were not too difficult to follow. A great way to get back into shape (before and after). Sara Holliday's yoga workout is not just for pregnant women. Highly recommened!!!!!!!!!!!",1155945600,,310,4.362068965517241
2561837,5,B000FDO09O,I really enjoyed this workout and I'm not even pregnant!!! It is fast paced and challenging yet completely doable and the relaxation segment at the end is fantastic. I'd highly recommend this to everyone and feel it would make a great gift to congratulate a new Mom to be.,1154304000,,272,4.571428571428571
2561838,5,B000FDO09O,This prenatal yoga workout is calming and yet keeps a good pace and gives a good workout.  I especially like all the ways the workout helps work on posture.  I highly recommend Sara Holliday's yoga workouts.  It is a fabulous way to stay toned while you are pregnant.,1154217600,2,267,4.520833333333333
2561839,5,B000FDO09O,"I am not pregnant yet, but purchased this dvd to get in shape and increase my flexibility.  I am new to yoga, so I was very pleased that I was able to do the stretches and poses with ease.  The instructor is easy to follow and the flow of the movements is relaxing and refreshing.  I would recommend this dvd to all women, pregnant or not.",1146182400,2,339,4.106060606060606
2561840,5,B000FDO09O,"You don't have to be pregnant to do this yoga workout.  Since it was designed for the first trimester, there is really very little mention of pregnancy at all.

For someone who's not that flexible, the stretches are ""do-able"" and if you are consistent you will notice results.  At first, the repeated yoga salutations will seem to go on and on but after after a few classes you get the hang of the movements.  It provides a low intensity aerobic workout and the rhythm of the methodical movements is very relaxing.  The only negative I found with the video is the quality of the sound because it fades in and out.  Overall, I think this is a great way to ease back into an exercise routine.",1145923200,,690,4.436507936507937
8121276,4,B000FDO09O,"Sara is very pleasant and is a great  teacher. Always reminding you to and how to breathe, very important to me. Having picked up yoga (really any form of exercise) again after a few years of absence, I found myself getting very nauseous even after 35-40 minutes. This video is almost 50 minutes long. In the delicate stages of the first trimester, 20 minutes is all my body will allow and really all I have time for on a daily basis. It's too bad I have to 'quit' at 20 minutes, I don't feel complete!",1394496000,,502,4.28421052631579
8121277,1,B000FDO09O,"Perhaps the workouts are good, but I never made past the first 10. Insures of the tape. I just didn't like the tone or narrative of the instructor.",1382572800,,147,4.285714285714286
8121278,4,B000FDO09O,"This DVD feels low budget, but if you can overlook that, the routine is really great.

I usually find myself getting bored or wanting to skip certain parts of a yoga routine, but this is not the case for my with this DVD. I am engaged the whole way through.

I especially like that Sara gives adequate time to release from poses.  Instead of just moving on the the next pose, she has you rest in forward bend for a breath or rotate your ankle to release before moving to the other side.

Another thing I really like is that Sara walks you through progressive muscle relaxation before resting in corpse pose, this really helps me to relax at the end of the workout.

I wanted a DVD that was good for pregnancy but didn't just focus on the huge belly that I don't have yet. This is it. And if I end up with the awesome muscle tone that Sara has, I certainly won't complain.

Four stars instead of five because the production quality is really not great.  As another reviewer mentioned, there is this weird smoke going across the screen the whole time that really makes it feel cheesy.  After I've done a routine a few times, I really don't look at the TV much, so the smoke doesn't bother me too much.  I also sort of wished she had voiced over instead of giving vocal direction while she does the routine herself.  While she moves her voice gets softer or louder or more muffled based on her position. This bugs me a little bit, but not as much as I thought it would when I first got the DVD.

So, if you are in your first trimester, I recommend this DVD.",1346112000,,1554,4.2517006802721085
8121279,5,B000FDO09O,"Great video. It is very easy to follow yet hard and rewarding. I did w first pregnancy all of her dvds and while it did not help weight gain i had no pregnancy symptoms, pains, and i had a very easy labor.  I have been working out at the gym this pregnancy and it has helped weight gain but late in second trimester having tons of back pain and just pulled out dvds again to prepare for delivery n help w back, shoulder, rib pain.",1312848000,,430,4.0588235294117645
8121280,5,B000FDO09O,"I really enjoy this dvd.  There is a natural flow between poses with good descriptions, and the selection is great for allover stretching and toning.  Unlike some prenatal dvd's, it actually does give a workout.  I don't feel too exhausted afterward, but I do feel that I've accomplished something.  Many of the poses were ones that I enjoyed before pregnancy, so the transition in this first dvd is not enormous.  The instructor's voice is pleasant and thoughtful.  I would highly recommend this.

I also bought Prenatal Yoga with Mary Pappas-Sandonas and disliked it.  That dvd had no transitions, too many props, and poses with little to no stretching...I got more of a workout from constantly stopping the dvd and moving all of the props for the next pose.  I would not recommend it at all.",1299715200,,794,4.822222222222222
8121281,2,B000FDO09O,The quality of this video is very poor.  Additionally there's really not much difference between this and a regular yoga workout (at least for the first trimester).  Maybe the other two are better.,1255737600,,197,4.9393939393939394
8121282,1,B000FDO09O,"I have tried a few different prenatal yoga dvds and this one was by far my least favorite. The first thing I noticed was the laughably bad production value. The word ""cheesy"" comes to mind. A smoke machine?! It was a bit silly. And her instruction was seriously lacking. I guess for someone who is really new to yoga this might be ok, but even her breathing instruction bothered me. She seemed to have lungs the size of a small bird or something,  I could not go at her pace as my breaths took much longer. Overall, I wasn't thrilled with every aspect of this dvd, the poses, the way she instructed them, the sound quality (AWFUL,) the video quality, the ridiculous set, etc. Save your money or invest in a different dvd.",1218931200,,721,4.421052631578948
8121283,1,B000FDO09O,"This video was clearly for those yoga experts or people that do yoga quite often.  I am not new to yoga, but I had quite a bit of difficultly completing this video.  This is not a relaxing exercise for those in first trimester that experience fatigue AND nausea!!!!  I'm not impressed, and feel ripped off by the whole experience!!!!!",1201737600,,334,4.627118644067797
8121284,4,B000FDO09O,"I am a person who loves special features, extravagent sets, and perfect costumes.  At first, I was put off by the apparent low-budget set.  After I did the practice, I began to appreciate the instructor's effectivenss and choice of rotine.  Its one of the only prenatal yoga videos that have strengthening and toning as a focus, rather than relaxing or stretching.  Most of the poses are standing poses, similar to a real yoga class.  Many other prenatal yoga dvds are designed to be ""generic""... I mean that its okay for all stages of pregnancy.  This one is unique because it doesn't modify to be too easy.

If you have done yoga in a studio, you will probably like this dvd.  If you do yoga to relax rather than tone, it probably is not what you want.

A word about the instructor - she has a confident voice, not whinny or breathy.  She also looks like an athlete - a swimmer or something. She is very strong looking.  Also- she did not indicate that she was actually pregnant at the time of filming- only that she did these type of things during her pregnancy.

I will do this the next time I am pregnant.",1182470400,6,1110,4.413793103448276
8121285,2,B000FDO09O,"I bought all three series of prenatal yoga and I regret it.  This video does not offer walk throughs on how to do many of the poses.  She just quickly changes from one pose to the next, without explaining how to do it, give you time to inhale or exhale properly, show you where and how to position hands and feet for support, or how to twist core body, etc.  Both her verbal explanations and visuals leave me frustrated, wondering if I should position the hands one way or another for a particular pose.  What is worse, the camera does not follow many of her important movements, focusing sometimes only on her face or on a detail of her shirt, instead of showing how she is positioning her arms, hand, toes, etc. even when she puts them behind her body  -- these are important details in yoga, because incorrect poses can lead to injuries.",1181088000,3,840,4.428571428571429
