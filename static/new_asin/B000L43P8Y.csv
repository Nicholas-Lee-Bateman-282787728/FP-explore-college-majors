Overall, a very solid set. Especially if you can get it for under $20. Many fights and a few explosive knock-outs. By the way, be on the lookout for The Punk ""maddogging"" Ryan Gracie, even after the match. The Punk is one intense fella. If you are an MMA fan, be sure to get yourself a copy. Then sit back and enjoy.",1210291200,14,2296,5.349030470914127
2700286,2,B000L43P8Y,"after watching all the ufc fights i decided to give pride fighting a try. and it does not even compare to ufc. so if you are a ufc fan don't waste your time on any pride fights. the rules are more strict, the fighters pretty much suck and it is pretty boring. whats the deal with wearing pads and no kicks to the head? or no knees to the head? no thank you i will stick with ufc.",1209513600,,379,3.871794871794872

8160239,5,B000L43P8Y,"the real deal, the best promotion ever and the most glorius events from them, they are here and you should get it",1355702400,,113,4.181818181818182
8160240,4,B000L43P8Y,"The Bushido fights were based on action, this is a great formula if the styles fit. Team Japan vs. Gracie is rather slow until the young Gracies ,especially Ryan (R.I.P.), add a spark. The second disc is Japan vs. Chute Boxe so here is the action, not only does Chute Boxe Academy live up to it's name, Team Japan seems to respond making close matches. The third is less themed as in teams competing but all discs include great bouts outside the teams featuring Cro Cop and other greats. Remember, this revolves around action, so mostly fast stand-ups.",1331683200,,552,4.642857142857143
8160241,5,B000L43P8Y,Really great fights. Very entertaining.  I would definately recommend this video to anyone.  Lots of hours of fights and so much fun to watch.,1326067200,,142,4.875
