Another crazy thing, all of the artwork indicates that this is the original version (which I also have on DVD), but when I load the disc it displays the cast of the inferior remake. What the hell? Don't get fleeced. Stick with an alternate release, but not this one. I only saw a couple of one-star reviews and apparently few other people have had issues. Still, out of dozens of Blu-rays, new and old, this is the only disc that refuses to load not because of a  manufacturing defect, but rather a built in refusal to recognize my valid and licensed player.

434866,5,6302168465,"We are visited by a flying saucer that lands near the U.S. capital. As a precaution the saucer is surrounded by the military with tanks, carbines, and side arms. The ship opens up and a being, Klaatu (Michael Rennie), steps out. He makes a menacing move with a foreign object. A quick thinking well trained military man shoots first.

Why are we being visited? A mysterious man named Mr. Carpenter may hold the answer. However the only people that will listen to the message are the world's scientists. To bring his point home Klaatu holds a demonstration. The result of the demonstration gives the movie its title ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""

Besides being a classic this movie also captures a time. It is intriguing looking at the technology of the time and even the locations before they changed (some have not changed).

It is still fun to watch as Klaatu is encountered, detained, and the state of the governments (does not look like things have changed much). We all want to say to Gort ""Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!""

This movie was better built than most for its time and rivals some movies of today. The message is still relevant and we sometimes try to apply the same solution here.",1504742400,4,1194,4.644549763033176

434902,5,6302168465,"This is one of the first of the 1950s flying saucer movies and arguably the best. The many extra features on the Blu-ray disc alone justify the purchase. According to the ""making of"" feature, the producers ultimately decided against casting Spencer Tracy and Claude Rains as Klaatu, preferring to use an unknown Michael Rennie which time has proven to be the right choice.

The smooth simplicity of the saucer rendered it timeless even as much more recent, highly detailed movie spacecrafts appear much more dated. Combine a compelling script, flawless direction, excellent acting and effective special effects and you have the perfect template for the 1950s sci-fi movie genre.

I showed it to my young nephew and he loved it, especially the part where Gort's ocular death ray predated the metal robot in ""Thor"" by over 60 years. This film also helped him to develop a more mature attention span that doesn't require constant explosions and special effects to hold his interest.

434973,4,6302168465,"This classic scifi film will not play on my computer for some reason.  I'm assuming there's some anti-piracy software running, which is odd since where I do have two external bluray drives, I don't actually have any copying software, and both bluray drives are read-only.  Oh well.

The movie is about as I remember it from way back when.  One of the guys on the ""making of"" documentary included on the disk states that the film has a documentary feel to it.  Eh, maybe.  I got more of a sense that it had more of a film noire vibe going visually with all the harsh shadows and high contrast shots.

The acting is on par for an early 1950s offering--a kind of natural yet comported behavioral norm when people were a little more polite.  The message, however, now that I'm a middle aged dude, doesn't strike me as being very sound; i.e. ""We'll kill you if you stir any trouble"" kind of thing.  Well, okay, that's kind of what all international policies are guided by these days, but Klaatu's race promises annihilation, and not just simple conquest.  I mean, wow.  Is that really how a superior species or race greets newcomers on the interstellar scene?

It is a 1950s film, and so it has a somewhat hokey feel to it with the theramin music going on combined with the stereotypical flying saucer and giant killer robot.  It's a window into science fiction film making from another period.  It has some good messages, but it also has some messages that maybe you should think about for a bit before agreeing or disagreeing.

Either way it's slower paced and enjoyable.  No massive battles, no intricate action scenes with lots of derring-do, none of the usual stuff that unfortunately pollutes a lot of scifi made for today's pre-to-post teen audiences.  Take it for what it's worth, relax and enjoy on your day off from work.",1491350400,,1826,4.62111801242236

TITLE: The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)  G  1:32:11
  Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe
  Robert Wise (Director)

  The ORIGINAL thinking-man's science fiction movie. Those of you that have seen it KNOW what I'm talking about (and can skip my rather long-winded musings and go directly to the ""VIDEO"" and ""AUDIO"" portion of this review). For the rest of you: please, read on.

  If you are one of those people who was raised on the action-oriented, extremely loud, special-effects driven, ""sci-fi"" movies of the last twenty, or so, years (hey, I ain't hatin', I liked most of them too), AND you have yet to see this movie, then probably EVERYTHING that you see and hear ABOUT it will make it seem like another potentially huge waste of time  a waste of time, that the old-timers (like your mom and dad), for reasons known only to them, are always ranting and raving about how YOU should drop everything and watch it NOW, because of how great THEY think it is. Yes, it is a black-and-white movie from the fifties (the poodle skirt wearing, tail-finned car driving, pipe-smoking father-knows-best NINETEEN-FIFTIES(!!!), for heaven's sake). Yes, the special-effects are dated, and, in some cases, even kinda cheesy looking. And, yes, it does star a bunch of people that you have probably NEVER heard of. However, every ""serious"" science fiction aficionado (i.e.someone who READS science fiction, as well as, WATCHES it) that I have EVER met LOVES this movie. Heck, every self-professed non-sci-fi person (young or old) that I've ever corralled into watching this movie, has  at the VERY least  liked it (and usually LOVED it). The main reasons being: that it is very well written, it is very well directed, it has very good acting, and (for its day) it has high production values (In fact, this movie (along with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing-from-Another-World/dp/B00009NHC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing from Another World</a>"" [commonly known as The ""original"" Thing]) were the first ""modern"" science fiction movies that were released by a major studio [Fox for this movie and RKO for ""The Thing""  also, because of their HUGE popularity, they helped to quickly usher in the 1950's science fiction ""craze""]). Also, its main plot points, regarding paranoia and fear, are still VERY relevant today.

  I think, if you keep an open mind (and focus on the message of the film) while watching it, that you will be VERY pleasantly surprised at how much you actually like this movie  plus, you'll finally know what the old-timers are talking about when they say things like ""Gort! Klaatu barada nicto!"" around you. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO: 1.37:1  B&W  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (35.3 Mbps)

  Fox Home Video is to be commended for its first-rate results in the re-mastering of this classic 1950's sci-fi gem. Because, this transfer exhibits very-good to frequently excellent picture quality  due, I'm sure, to its MUCH higher than average bit-rate (particularly for an ""old"", 4:3, B&W, movie). Another reason for the commendation is, that there were virtually NO artifacts such as black specks, white dots, hair-lines or dropped frames (though there was some weird fluttering for a few frames starting at approximately 1:10:50 into the movie, which is very likely because of the source elements used). In addition, sharpness and detail (except for some rather obvious stock footage, and some (probably) second-unit outdoor shots) are usually EXCELLENT throughout most of the film  with the textures of hair-styles, clothing and furnishings being readily apparent and natural looking. (In fact, the sharpness in this version is so good that, for the first time ever, in my 18 or 19 viewings of this movie, I could CLEARLY see black support wires holding Patricia Neal as Gort carried her into the spaceship!) Also, contrast and gray scale are VERY good overall, and in the outdoor daytime scenes, and in most of the well-lit indoor scenes, even excellent; however, there is almost NO shadow detail (and LOTS of black crush) in nearly all of the outdoor nighttime scenes (which, given the age of the film, is acceptable [at least, to me]). The only major issue that I find with this restoration and transfer of the film is that, it is SO GOOD that you see just how BAD and dated most of the special-effects are in the movie  which, all things considered, is a very nice ""problem"" to have. Overall, this movie's presentation on blu-ray has VERY good picture quality, and should satisfy all but the VERY pickiest of viewers.

AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (48kHz, 24-bit)

  Fox Home Video has also done extensive clean-up work, and a 5.1 re-mix, on the film's soundtrack. First-off, the good news is that there are no loud bumps nor objectionably high levels of hiss to be found anywhere. In addition, the dialog is very clear and all voices are easily understood  however, dynamic range is quite limited, and there isn't very much bottom-end nor any top-end to speak of (which makes the few sound effects contained in the movie seem a little harsh and constrained). Finally, although the soundtrack has been redone as a ""5.1"" re-mix, it is still essentially a MONOPHONIC soundtrack; yes, there is music (surprisingly good sounding music, considering its age) in the surrounds  but there is VERY little else there (aside from VERY infrequent crowd-noises and RARE environmental street-sounds). Overall, considering the age of the source elements and the fact that this is (despite proclamations to the contrary) still a monophonic, dialog-driven, movie from the early 1950's, its soundtrack has more than acceptable sound quality.

435046,5,6302168465,"I saw this film when it came out in 1951. I was 15 years old. I had been interested in science fiction for some time and had read sci-fi books and studied science in school, even taking an extra course of science. The film made an enormous impression upon me. It intensified my interest in whether people lived on other planets. It prompted me to ask: For those who believe that Christianity, Judaism, Islam is essential to life, would any of these religions exist on another planet. I doubted it. My doubt did not affect my religious practices.  But I suspected it would be devastating to many others. This, in turn, caused me to think of the purpose of religion and could this purpose be achieved without religion, and if it could, why do people need religion and religious practices.
I was also sadly impressed by how people feared the alien and how they wanted to hurt him. This is also a psychological phenomenon that people should think about.
Since 1951, I wanted to see the film again. I wondered if I would still like it. I found it on the Retro TV station and watched it. I was not disappointed at all.",1488412800,,1112,4.477832512315271

locations where that film was made. Especially since I worked at the White House and I could see the
Ellipse just south of the White House.
Billy Gray is an excellent actor and played Jim Thorpe(later Burt Lancaster) when Thorpe was a young boy.
Michael Rennie is the perfect Klaatu  as is Patricia Neal as Mrs. Benson and all the others.

435258,5,6302168465,"Just  finished watching ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" released by 20th Century Fox.
Confession time, this is the first time I had ever seen ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" in its entirety.  For some reason it was one of the few of the great classic Golden Age of Hollywood Science Fiction Movies that I had never seen - which was a bit odd considering how big of fans Mom and Dad were of classic science fiction movies.
Perhaps one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made, it is also perhaps one of the most allegorically religious science fiction movies ever made - not counting the often under-rated ""Red Planet Mars.""  It is also one of the most minimalist science fiction movies ever made.
A mixture of Old Testament and New Testament religious symbolism abounds in ""The Day The Earth Stood Still.""  Klaatu descends from the heavens in a spaceship and lands in a park in Washington, D.C.  Attempting to deliver a message of goodwill and a gift to the president of the United States that would have taught him about life on other planets, Klaatu is shot and wounded by a nervous nelly of a soldier.  Gort begins to defend Klaatu by destroying all the weaponry around the spacecraft. At this juncture, Gort does not take human life.
Taken to Walter Reed Army Hospital, Klaatu attempts to convince the American Government that a special session of the United Nations must be called so that he can deliver a message.  World leaders balk and refuse to attend.  Frustrated, Klaatu escapes from the hospital, and adopts the identity of Mr. Carpenter - there is a brief flash of the initials on the luggage Klaatu ""borrowed"":  JC.
Taking refuge in a boarding house, Klaatu meets and befiends Helen Benson and her son Bobby.  It is their acceptance of Klaatu and Helen's willingness to help him once he reveals the entire truth of his mission off screen that prevents the destruction of Earth.  In short, Klaatu has found two good humans making Earth worthy if being saved if humanity heeds the message and warning he was sent to deliver.  And when Klaatu smiles and waves good by to Helen, and she returns the gesture, there is an unspoken hope being revealed there.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Though certain aspects (mainly aesthetics, specific politics and the science) may be dated, the overall messages and observations of American society, and humankind as a whole, still ring true. The leads are all well cast, though some of the smaller parts get pretty wooden. Michael Rennie as Klaatu is a compellingly sympathetic alien and Patricia Neal as Helen is a well-developed and brave every-woman character in an era when many women were often relegated to love interests or living props. Billy Gray as Bobby is most surprising as a likable child character who actually serves a purpose in the plot! There are great observations about the media, how humans react to the unusual and unknown, and the importance of asking ourselves where society is heading and where we want to go.

As I understand it, this movie was inspired by a story, ""Farewell to The Master"" by Harry Bates.  That story is from 1940.  There were, of course, changes.  In the movie there is reference to the atomic bomb.  Of course the atomic bomb did not exist in 1940.

In the reading of the story that inspired the movie, I have found many differences.  The massive robot is named ""Gnut"".  Gnut engages in a terrible struggle with a gorilla after the death of Klaatu.  This story has a different and surprise ending.  I would recommend reading the story and THEN watching the movie.

435531,5,6302168465,"This is one of my all-time favorite films. It's good on so many levels. The acting is sure-footed. The directing is masterful. The sound and editing are superb. The story line doesn't particularly tread new ground; however, it's a positive twist on the too-prevalent  ""alien monster"" schlock of the genre. Granted, the special effects are dated, but they are surprisingly effective. Michael Rennie scores as the totally convincing alien. There's no big CGI budget, very little violence, no well-known Hollywood actors--yet the spell created by this masterpiece is real and enduring. Rennie is brilliant as the alien who visits Earth to deliver a message. Rennie perfectly portrays a deft combination of near-human emotion coupled with alien strangeness. The young boy who befriends him carries the viewer further into the film. The humans encountered by the alien are equally up to the task of portraying the genuine confusion, wonder and fear this other-world man invokes. Then there's Rennie's enforcer: the scene-stealing robot. The Theremin-laced music boosts up and wavers. The robot's visor slides open to reveal a serious weapon--a startlingly impressive laser. Without spoilers, let's just say, if you haven't seen this film (or haven't seen it recently), you might just fall in sci-fi-love.",1465344000,7,1299,5.399014778325123

The film that looks at the inefficiencies of world nations and their powers and how they manage it as a balance to their interactions to one another. I loved that the people who were willing to listen to potential end-times of the world and determine solutions with one another were not world leaders but the philosophers, scientists and leading thinkers of the time who already had relationships across their nation's shortcomings. A film not filled with action junk. As you begin to love this film, you need to memorize the three words of significance that a human had to speak to an alien robot, named Gort, in order to prevent ultimate destruction to humanity.",1465084800,,825,4.657534246575342

With twin rubber suits (one with a zipper in the front and the other with a zipper in the back), a large mock-up of the space ship, and clever lighting, this movie still holds up today. Michael Rennie stood six foot four, an imposing figure to Patricia Neal's five foot eight. Wise chose Rennie partially because he was an ""unknown"" actor to most Americans. Finally, the Gort suit (two of them) could only be filled by one man in Hollywood, that being Locke Martin who stood an astounding seven feet seven inches tall.

This was Wise's first science fiction move though he went on to direct The Andromeda Strain (1971) and Star Trek (1979)",1462924800,,778,4.678832116788321

The theme is idealistic; the writing is compelling; the production values equal the best of the early 1950s; and the cast is magnificent, especially Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal. Even the special effects are quite good for the times (and should not at all be judged by today's standards, though aren't terrible if they are). I have never seen the remake; not sure I want to.

435745,4,6302168465,"I've been a sci-fi buff ever since my mom took me to Star Wars when I was five.  I enjoy sci fi and fantasy books and films and television programmes but only recently have I taken the time to watch The Day the Earth Stood Still.  Don't expect outstanding special effects, Oscar-award-winning acting, or anything of that sort, and certainly don't expect accuracy when it comes to distances and time to travel between star systems.

No, the driving force behind the attraction of The Day the Earth Stood Still is simple: It is essentially a thought experiment regarding our paranoid, xenophobic and warlike nature as a species, and if other civilizations have achieved interstellar travel were to visit our planet, how would we greet them, and how would they receive our shortsighted, bigoted and aggressive nature?

The special effects are lousy (by today's standards), acting is... well, there is plenty of overacting (on part of some performers - I blame the over-acting feel on the artificial ""transatlantic accent"" which was all too common for the era and is the primary reason I haven't explored more 1950s science fiction films than I have) to the point where it feels very strained, scientific accuracy is all but absent... and yet, it has this strong appeal which makes one wonder - is there any hope for our future? If there is other intelligent life in the universe, would we make ourselves known as welcoming, moral, and peaceful, or would we make our greeting in the form of acts of war?

This film is ranked as the fifth best Sci Fi film ever.. I quite enjoyed it and have now watched it twice, and feel bad I haven't taken the time to watch it sooner. For all of its flaws, the ""transatlantic accent"" dominating the dialogue (which today lends the film an ""over-acted"" feel), scientific inaccuracies... it is well worth the watch for the social commentary and moralistic outlook, which are lessons that are very bit as timely today as they were in the postwar era during which the film was made.  I agree with the rankings, that this film is great, not for any one element in the film, because quite honestly it's sub-par, but rather for the cerebral experience, which is the thing that makes this one of the best sci fi films ever.",1459209600,,2246,4.716836734693878

436073,2,6302168465,"I like Sci-Fi and I like old movies.  But this movie was lacking in both entertainment and plot.

SPOILERS****************

So I get that this is supposed to mirror the issue with the cold war.  But this movie could be summed up with an alien saying ""If you're violent, we'll obliterate you.""  Which really isn't a good analogy since these aliens are much more powerful, apparently there to teach earth a lesson, while the cold war was about two sets of people with their fingers on a trigger.  A better analogy would be if the aliens were the last of their civilization looking to settle on earth, while the earth and the aliens both had bombs pointed at each other, from fear of not being able to trust the other.

The rest of the movie is spent with this single alien being dumb, gallavanting about earth in a boring manner without any precautions.  And the police / army forces being dumb, repeatedly trying to kill this alien without any thought of repercussions and secondly, having terrible security (think of the few guards around the space ship and how the alien's body was so easily retrieved, without anyone knowing about it).

Now this alien knew that earth was violent and he might be killed.
Why did he venture out with no protective gear?  They obviously were pretty advanced with their practically indestructible robot, so why could he not have better armor?

And why did he not have a more sophisticated way to contact his ship?  He seriously had to get close enough to shine little lights on the ship?  I mean they knew about radio waves back then- they could at least have had him use radio waves with some remote transmitter or something.  Or what makes even more sense: Have the robot follow him and protect his fragile comically human body.

And he knew that if he died, he would have no way to tell his robot to revive him.  Apparently his only plan was to get some human to speak the magic words to his robot.  Now how likely is it that he could both find someone to do this, have them remember the words, and also have this random human be able to get close enough to the ship to do it?  Oh right, their security around the ship sucked.

Secondly, what was his mission, really?  In the end he says:

""Your choice is simple.
Join us and live in peace,
or pursue your present course
and face obliteration.
We shall be waiting
for your answer.""

Okay, so right before this quote, he explains how it is robots like the one he brought which keep them in line.  Basically if anyone acts in aggression in his culture, the robots wipe them from existence or something really bad.  Earth has none of these robots.  So how can he expect the earth to change their ways if his own culture can't even behave without nanny destroyo bots?

And what does he mean by ""Join us and live in peace?""  What does he mean by ""Join us?""  Is he asking for the earth to agree to allow their robots to come down and occupy earth?  Or is he just asking them to not inflict violence upon each other?  Or is he asking for them to come fly away with him?  It is not clear and it is a bit confusing with how immediately he leaves on his ship.  He doesn't even wait to hear an answer.  Not to mention, he speaks in English the whole time around these people from different countries.

If he's talking about the atomic bomb, there is no way the bomb could reach their planet.  Is he really so concerned about humans destroying each other?  Does he really think that threatening to wipe the earth out ""if we wipe each other out"" makes a lot of sense?

I'm really not sure why this movie got such high reviews.",1453766400,2,3598,4.3969696969696965

Yes, its black & white but thats part of the magic. No, their is no gory violence. The bottom line is that this 1951 movie was so far ahead of its time. For example, I loved all the special effects. Then their was Gort the enforcer robot, the saucer that had ""no seams"". OMG! then the many actors that were chosen, who fit their parts perfectly. What a very wise choice of Klaatu to be portrayed by Michael Rennie. The thoughtful use of lighting and sound. The use of ""shadows"" to increase the scare, just plain wonderful. I've seen this movie too many times to count and each time I see it, something new appears that delights me.

436252,5,6302168465,"I give this movie a five star because it tells a story and actor delivers a sobering message in his final remarks just before he and his robot friend went back into space. The Day The Earth Stood Still is one of my favorite movies,I know that it is a science fiction movie but it has a message. This is the third time I watch this movie and every time I watch it I say to myself ho how I wish that everyone on this planet would take time out to see this movie and heed the advice of the actor in his final remarks. My friends, we need no telling that our world in a state of confusion and before long we will be caught in the throws of the final battle of all ages called Armageddon, unless God Almighty intervene and save us from ourselves. It is lamentable that people no longer care for each other, our hell born pride,our prejudices,our ego and our hell bent attitude and our thirst for blood and destructive behavior is more than enough material to build our highway to hell. This is not the way we
ought to live with each other on this planet, we were meant to be our brothers keeper be they black, yellow or white. We need to stop looking at each other longitude and latitude and national origin in my book I care less what color your house is, be it black, yellow, red, brown or white (I am referring to the bodies in which our souls are housed) for those that believe that they have a soul. As the actor said in his final remarks not until all are safe individually none of us are safe and that is a fact cold hard facts. I love everyone that I meet along life's perilous journey because I don't see bodies nor skin color I see souls eternal souls that will live for all eternity. In closing I want to entreat all my fellow human beings that read this review to see this movie with an open mind and think about the safety of our children and our generation that is yet to come long after we are gone, to prepare a better world for them in which they can coexist regardless of their race, color, creed or national origin and in so doing we will leave a good legacy for them for which they will be eternally grateful.",1448323200,5,2124,4.170316301703163

And as a Washingtonian, I was genuinely impressed by the real-life DC backdrop images of the day (even though some were shot with rear-projection techniques).  It was a real DC setting, not a Los Angeles pretend-scape.

In terms of the sci-fi effects, it was really ahead of its time as well.  It was simple but technically well crafted; no wires visible or wobbling spaceships, and it didn't rely on a lot of hocus pokus ideas.

I remember the movie and Gort as being very scary when I was young.  Now it is an epic anti-war themed movie easily worth your viewing time.  Make some popcorn!",1447977600,,688,4.590163934426229

Look out for spoilers, in case you are one of the few people who has never seen this movie. As I look at the movie through adult eyes, I realize that Klatu is as much to blame for the miscommunications between him and Earthlings as the Earthlings are. He walks out of his spaceship wearing a space helmet, even though he can breathe Earths air, and holds up a mysterious thing, knowing that Earth people are violent and edgy.
Rather than agreeing to meet with Earths leaders one at time, he insists on meeting them all at once, knowing that they will not agree to that.
So the story is a lot about culture clash.
Any way its a good movie. Yeah, its easy to poke holes in some of the science, but mostly its good stuff, great acting, and wonderful music.",1446336000,,1000,4.208333333333333

  and free Klatu from prison...
  This  lazer  energy beam  was so new  and far reaching into the future,  1951,
  that there was not even a name for it...
  Special effects were quite good for the period,
  and the movie sound of the  weird electronic music  (Theramin)  was apt, and  truly inspired !!

437171,5,6302168465,"For the classic SciFi fan, this is a great 1950's visionary tale.  Remade in the early 2000s, showing the classic vision.

As most 50's era movies, they are less complex, and usually more thought provoking.  Treading on the politics of the day (post nuclear war and world control) this story is a view into the mind and ideas of the time.

I would recommend it.  If you are interested enough to read the reviews, you will enjoy the time spent.",1442620800,,443,4.4875

I was ten years old and remember where I saw it and how profoundly it affected me then and still does today.  In fact, it is more relevant today and the craft in our skies witnessed throughout the world makes me wonder are there fleets of Gorts patrolling our world even now!  Our nuclear missiles in their silos have been taken off line in the US and in Russia.  Nuclear Power Plants have seen these things hovering around and over them.  Even Chernobyl had visitations.

Just one look at the GIGANTIC GORT thing with bees flying out of it makes everyone laugh...how sad, what a tragedy and waste of a potentially great opportunity to do a faithful, realistic, and exciting remake for today's audiences.

That said, The Day the Earth Stood Still, though very steeped in its time, is an example of universal film making that earns the term ""classic.""
A tight story, good actors, good sound track, and layers that make this an enjoyable experience for several generations.

437794,5,6302168465,"This review is for the 1951 original, NOT the abysmal Keanu Reeves remake. The atmosphere of this movie is pure 1950's - capitalizing on the genuine fear that flying saucers or nuclear war could snuff us out at the speed of a gamma ray. Bernard Herrmann's score meshes perfectly with the script, years before he polished off North by Northwest, Vertigo or Psycho. Whether it's the two medical doctors smoking in a military hospital or Gort's powerful ray melting a tank, everything about this film is classic; right down to Klaatu's instructions for preventing Gort from destroying the world - ""Gort; Klaatu barada nikto!

I watch this movie every few months and it never fails to satisfy my need to be chilled by dialogue, story and music. No CGI. No blood and guts. And best of all - no environmental polemics!",1440288000,6,812,4.75886524822695

437910,5,6302168465,"This is still one of the premier science fiction movies.  It's amusing to note, though, that Klaatu says he traveled about 250 million miles, which would put his home planet somewhere between Mars and Jupiter at their closest approaches to Earth.  Maybe he's from dwarf-planet Ceres?  Also, he says his spaceship zips along at 4000 mph --  an impressive speed when the movie was made, but less than 13 percent of the speed at which NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto.  You'd think such a technologically advanced civilization as Klaatu's would construct peppier spaceships.  But let's not quibble.  The script, performances, direction, cinematography and special effects (for its time) are excellent.

438722,4,6302168465,"I was born the year this movie first appeared in theaters and have been a SciFi fan for most of that time. Initially, of course, there was little media around to fill a child's needs for such. Most novels were in the section of the library reserved for adults and I was too young to borrow them, and most SF movies were pretty awful, but there were 4 that to my young mind were fantastic: War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planet, Robinson Crusoe on Mars, and best of all The Day The Earth Stood Still. When the latter was first shown on TV I wasn't old enough to stay up and watch it to the end, but I was so enthralled with it that after our parents sent us to bed I talked my brother and sisters into hiding with me in the hall and craning our necks around the corner to watch the rest of it (5 of us disobeying would blunt the punishment each would receive). Needless to say, near the end of the movie we were caught. Surprisingly our parents showed a rare bit of forbearance and allowed us to watch the ending.

Visually it doesn't hold a candle to the movies that CG allows to be made 55 years later and the plot is rather unsophisticated (also the 1950's attitudes and concerns seem amusing in this day and age) but every time I watch it I travel back to those days of my youth and love it once again.",1437868800,,1303,4.150197628458498

438808,5,6302168465,"This film still stands as one of the all time SF classics. It has great acting by Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal. The SFX are solid but not flashy. The robot Gort is still one of the few classic movie robots. The story is directed by Robert Wise in a realistic and suspenseful film noir fashion that is rare in science fiction movies. It was adapted from a short story called 'Farewell to the Master' by Harry Bates. If you are a true SF fan, read the story and you will be pleasantly surprised at the differences.

The script/story are intelligent but not perfect. For example: Klaatu boasts that he has traveled 250 million miles to reach Earth, but that is not a great enough distance to even leave our solar system. Also, a picture of Klaatu with his space helmet on is sent out during his manhunt - surely they took a picture of him with his helmet off while he was in their hospital. But these are minor failings in a very good script and story.

The Amazon video quality was excellent.

Note: this film is far superior to the recent remake starring Keanu Reaves.",1437523200,2,1071,4.426395939086294

They have such a cool tone and style, and despite the decade being famous for conformity and conservatism I feel a lot of the weirdness and anxiety and discontent was sublimated into the science fiction, much the same way the cynicism was sublimated into film noir.

The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the best of the '50s sci-fi films. This is not a B-Movie, but a big affair by a major studio with a brilliant script, classic director (Robert Wise!), great cast, lots of great location footage, beautifully shot, and with nifty special effects... okay, maybe the robot Gort can't move around very well, but at least he looks damn cool! It's really night-and-day compared to the public perception that the decade only offered threadbare cheapies.

The film looks spectacular in HD, and the extras are really engrossing, covering not just the film, but the film's place in history as both an anti-nuclear plea as well as it's influence on later UFO true-believers.",1437004800,4,1132,4.712121212121212

439664,5,6302168465,"Quite a while since last seeing this B&W classic. Much better than its re-make a few years back, as the focus is on story and character development, rather than spectacular special effects. The real back story here is the movie's references to the Cold War paranoia that had taken hold following WWII. We had just emerged from a terrible global conflict, the Iron Curtain had descended, and the suspicion and possibility of new nuclear-tipped conflict was growing more each day. In this case, though, an envoy from ""out there,"" along with his frightening and unstoppable sidekick, drops by and delivers an observation and a warning to Earthlings to clean up our act...or else. A great storyline that played to the emotions of the time. The visual that accompanies this movie's listing is spot on and effectively sets the stage, too.

For realism, there are numerous shots of recognizable sites and buildings in and around Washington DC., which make the overall story very believable for the theatergoers in 1951. While the special effects may be considered archaic by today's computer-driven standards, they create the visual impact that was state of the art for its day. (Spoiler Alert - On watching this once again, my only question is, during the supposedly harmless demonstration of our visitor's true power - on the day when the Earth stood still - what became of all the airplanes in the skies? But don't let such things get in the way of an increasingly gripping story, eh?)

This is one of the early sci-fi masterpieces. As such, it deserves a look into the way that such stories were told in the contrast and shadows of classic black and white film. Taken for what it is and the time in which it was made, this remains a great watch. Now, dim the lights please, and pass the popcorn...",1436400000,2,1794,4.783870967741936

If your interest is primarily in flash and crash or CGI this gem, unfortunately, is not for you...but it will be your loss. Some reviewers have alluded to religious overtones in the film. Although a weak case might be made by stretching one's imagination, it's a futile exercise and does nothing for the story whatsoever. And it's doubtful that the films creators  intended such allusions. The film does have a serious message however and it's as relevant today as it was sixty four years ago and actually even more so now. If the events depicted were to actually happen (IF ONLY!!) the world would become a better and safer place or, to quote Rennie's trenchant line as Klatu, ""...be reduced to a burnt out cinder""...and the choice is ours. By all meansee this film or ignore it at your own peril and definitely ignore the characters who really can't appreciate it  and definitely ignore the recent version which is a travesty.",1433635200,,1009,4.7272727272727275

439760,5,6302168465,"Easily one of the best SF movies of all time and one of my own top choices for any film.  I saw it on NBC's ""Saturday Night at the Movies"" in 1962 at an impressionable age, was hooked, and have happily remained so since then.

It was loosely based on the Harry Bates short story ""Farewell to the Master"" -- which is actually very different, though quite good on its own.  I prefer the movie's storyline -- the updating to flying saucers and a very 1950's feel to the storyline and the way the movie was made.  The primary theme of the danger of atomic weapons was right on the money -- it was made only half a dozen years after the first bombs were made -- and would continue to be a major worry for years to come (as it still is).

The cast was great and I liked the chemistry among Helen (Patricia Neal), son Bobby (Billy Gray) and Klaatu (Michael Rennie).  Director Robert Wise talks about how well they worked together in the comments track (which I recommend; it's on the DVD version), which he did with screenwriter Nicholas Meyer.  The supporting cast was also good -- I even liked the performance of Hugh Marlowe, who played the unscrupulous insurance salesman who had his eye on Helen.

This is always a joy to watch and I usually watch it back to back, first without comments, then with, as I think it adds a lot to find out how the film was made and how the director felt about the many different things that make it up.  It's not just the FX, which are good enough, very good considering the period in which it was made. The story is complex and very well put together -- even as a kid I loved the part of the ""Einstein-like"" professor (Sam Jaffe).

I would like a sequel, (not the 2008 remake, though it's not really bad).  But I suppose you can't have everything.",1433203200,,1777,4.306306306306307

A military radar station tracks a bogey (unknown flying object) flying at 4,000 miles an hour around the world. Speakers on the radio inform their audiences. People watch the sky. This round object lands in a baseball field in Washington. People are alarmed! Soldiers surround it. A helmeted being emerges. A lieutenant fires a pistol hitting an object held in a hand! Then another being emerges. The civilians scream and run away! A beam of light from its helmet destroys rifles and tanks! The Presidents secretary arrives to interview Klaatu. Klaatu wants to meet with representatives of all peoples in the world. The future of the planet is at stake!

The spaceship is studied by experts. It's made of the toughest material, nothing like on earth. Can the leaders of the world agree to a meeting? These beings are super-human. Klaatu escaped from Walter Reed Hospital, and they search for him. Mr. Carpenter rents a room and talks to other people. Young Bobby Bensons father was killed at Anzio. They discuss life. Carpenter writes a formula on a professors blackboard. Mr. Brady (a government agent) visits Carpenter and leaves with him. Later he is brought to Professor Barnhart. Klaatu explains his mission. Atomic energy in a spaceship threatens other planets, they will act to prevent this. Klaatu warns of the alternative. Bobby tells his Mom about Mr. Carpenter. Carpenter borrows Bobbys Boy Scout flashlight.

Bobby follows Mr. Carpenter, who flashes a message to that spaceman. Then he enters the spaceship and speaks a report. [What language?] Will they believe Bobby? [No locked doors then?] Is Carpenter a crook or a diamond smuggler? At noon every mechanical device stops working all over the world! Then power is restored. [Have you ever lived without electricity? Note how ladies wear white gloves.] The military hunt for the spaceman, alive if possible. Is he a danger to the people? The search goes on. Carpenter gives a message to Mrs. Carpenter: Klaatu barada nikto. [Is that an earthly language?] Their taxicab is followed. Get that message to Gort!

The troops shoot at Carpenter, he falls! Mrs. Benson repeats the message. The Colonel reports Carpenter is dead and in a jail cell. Gort takes the body back to the spaceship and applies their technology. Carpenter is brought to life! The group by the spaceship watch Gort, Mrs. Benson, and Klaatu walk out. Klaatu warns them against threats of aggression and violence. Robot police keep the peace for these planets. Live in peace or face obliteration. What will the planet earth decide? The spaceship then flies away to outer space.

This story reminds me of the New Testament where a teacher preaches peace to the people, then it attacked and killed by the military (who effect the wishes of the ruling class). After death the teacher rises again to repeat his teachings then flies away to the heavens. Will people follow this teaching? Read the newspapers. Robot police to keep order? Milovan Djilas wrote how any group that controls society will form a New Class who will rule for their benefit, a new ruling class. Is eternal vigilance still the price of freedom?",1429747200,2,3183,4.953183520599251

That worry is still here today as rogue nations acquire these bombs and have very poor leadership. I have watched this film over many times over the years and it always is a joy to see the actors work the story line. Yes, the rounded cars are funny looking just as they are on any Superman episodes. They can only use what is available to them- they don't work in modern cards though some form of computer generation. I suppose it could be done but then what about next years car. People love to pick at things attaching a religious meaning to the members and I suppose you could draw parallels to a lot of things. These people have too much time on their hands. Enjoy the film for what it is and remember they made this long before that preposterous Transformers film. While transformers may have entertainment for the cartoon crowd I see no reason to even watch it. That is the junk of today.  This film is considered a classic among most of the Sci-Fi people I know. I own at least one copy of it. Probably more.",1425859200,,1670,4.251572327044025

440089,5,6302168465,"I've seen this movie at least a half a dozen times over the years and each time I spot something I missed before.

This movie is a true classic in all meanings of the word. Michael Rennie's preformance is stunning as the alien invader, Klattu. Patrica Neal and Billy Gray (of Father Knows Best fame - who played her young son) were both great as well. And Gort, the silver hued robot, scared the crap out of 10's of thousands kids in the 50's and 60's. The 2008 remake was quite simply not very good, especially compared to the original. Sam Jaffe plays the world famous professior (an Einstein like role) very well. And Francis Bavier (of Mayberry fame) has a nice supporting role as well. Robert Wise does a great job directing in one of his more famous movies.

I would rate this a extremely high 9.25 to 9.75 - nearly a perfect sci-fi movie - VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENED!!

On of my favorite scenes invovles Klattu talking with Billy about the trains that don't need any track because they 'float' above the ground - kind of like the trains in Japan that levitate and travel up to 300 miles AN HOUR! I always find it interesting when Sci-Fi become science fact,

And I almost forgot that Hugh Marlowe (of Earth Vs the Flying Saucer fame) plays the snitch and boyfriend of Patrica Neal. He does a very good job with a relatively minor role - paticularly the scene involving the diamonds that Klaatue gave the Patrica Neal character.

This movie works on several different levels and should be viewed by nearly eveyong at least once in their life! Yes - it's that good!

I would rate this a very, very high 9.25 to 9.75 - nearly a perfect movie! VERY, VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1424390400,2,1674,4.490131578947368

440128,5,6302168465,"This is a review of the 2003 single-disc release ASIN:B00005JKFR, which includes extras apparently from the Laserdisc release. The ""restoration comparison"" compares a 1993 film transfer (warts 'n all) against a ""1995 Laserdisc release."" One of the interviewees on the 80-minute ""Making the Earth Stand Still"" documentary mentions ""this Laserdisc release."" The headline for my review is a result of reading reviews of the 2008 release (DVD and BD, timed for the remake release) that identify that ""Making the Earth Stand Still"" is missing, replaced by a shorter piece. The later 2-disc release may be missing the bazillion production photos in the stills gallery as well.

So if you're getting the later BD release, compare the price with the 2008 remake 3-disc BD release that includes a BD of the original 1951 film (no extras), and get the cheaper of the two, and find a copy of this two-sided DVD release for the extras.",1422835200,,923,4.9935064935064934

440323,5,6302168465,"This is a solemn and intellectual movie as opposed to, say, Independence Day or War of the Worlds.
In this film, an advanced society wants to study Earth before they take any action.  To do this, they install someone who can 'pass' as a normal human among the rest of us.  Michael Rennie is masterful in this role as an observor who can learn so much from a simple conversation with normal folk at a private bed 'n breakfast.
The 'invaders' came prepared for any eventuality with peace(Rennie) or war(his giant and all-powerful robot).  In the end, Rennie learns we are a planet on the brink of self-destruction but Mankind might be worth saving.  He must give a final order to his robot, either destroy these creatures or spare them.  Which would it be?
To appreciate this thoughtful film, you have to reset your mindset to understand the zeitgeist(the spirit of the times:
There was a 'Cold War' with the 'Reds' that threatened to become a 'hot war'.  UFO's were the thing; many thought, and some still do, that Ike (President Eisenhower) was actually shown UFO's or occupants thereof.  Finally, a brilliant religious scholar, Fulton Sheen, was a minor TV phenomenon.  He would lecture us on just about everything.  This is only relevant as he looked and sounded uncannily like Michael Rennie.

If you want an intellectual as opposed to a Saturday cartoon approach to a meeting of worlds, then this is your choice.  If you just want nonstop action, this is definitely not at all for you...",1418601600,,1491,4.74031007751938

You won't see a lot of fancy special effects of modern productions, but the opening and closing of the spacecraft (and how the seams disappear) was an inspired aspect in this film. This film is very ""50s"" and depicts characters and settings of that time period - enjoy the nostalgia. Women wear dresses and men wear suit coats and ties, even at breakfast and walking around town. All of the actors play their roles extremely well.

The simplicity of the robot is its most ominous feature and I liked that his size (although somewhat larger than the average man) does not in any way represent the extent of his power. I thought the alien Klaatu was perfectly depicted as an intelligent being superior to man in many ways but with an understanding of the value of interacting with others on a personal level.

Black and white filming has its advantages as there are numerous seamless cuts to stock footage integrated with actors in a variety of settings, making it seem that scenes were filmed around the world and throughout Washington.  The variety of complex scenes depicting the world standing still will surprise you [and I will always remember the key exceptions]. The play of the shadows was also exceptional in the black and white format.

This is not an action flick but is heavy on character and emotional states -- not only the individuals who are the main characters but look at the faces of people in the crowds or gathered around the TV or radio, and listen to the chatter at the breakfast table. Very well done. This is an outstanding film not to be missed.",1417219200,9,1782,4.717041800643087

generated towards the white european. They are always ready to destroy anything that they don't understand; frighten of; or
is not like themselves, but, that is just my opinion and basically that is what the movie is about. Michael Renny and his robot
are from another planet and goes to earth with a message about miltarily destruction which could affect other planets whom are
in peace. The robots are the planetary police of the solar system and their job is to maintain peace throughout the solar system
and our world, if not our planet will be destroyed. This is the 1951 black and white orginal version of  the day the earth stood still.

440789,5,6302168465,"The commentary on the disc is a conversation between Nicholas Meyer and Robert Wise and is consistently interesting. Both make good observations; only a few stretches of digressive anecdotes appear. One of Meyer's strong points is his remark (in praise of Patricia Neal), ""There are actors you can see thinking and actors you cannot see thinking."" Hugh Marlowe's face gives away no thought to Meyer while Neal and Michael Rennie are actors with open, reflective faces. It's a good comment, and Meyer is also able to elicit some revealing observations from director Robert Wise: his lack of rehearsal time (due to costs), his use of storyboarding, his taking on the direction with the project already underway, his dislike of cinematic style as an end in itself (the moving camera, surround sound), his working methods with composer Bernard Herrmann. Wise comes off as a self-effacing, somewhat unassertive but more than capable artist, especially in his talent for making visual simplicity very artistic. My vote for the best comment is Wise first saying a bit apologetically that today's film style is so flashy and energized followed by Meyer's reassuring remark that his young daughter, raised on modern movies, just watched this movie and was riveted by it in spite of the black-and-white photography and austere visuals. Wise was quite properly pleased.",1402790400,,1358,5.205479452054795

From the initial reaction of the military when the flying saucer lands, to the government red tape, to Klaatu's observations of humans, to the ending, the movie reflects a lot about the fears of the time. If I tell too much about the synopsis, it ruins the movie.

Filmed entirely on the FOX backlot (except for a few 2nd unit shots of D.C.), no one at the time could have imagined that THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL would reach legendary status and remain there almost 60 years later.

The story of the arrival in the U.S. capital city of alien Klaatu and his policeman robot Gort remains relevant to this day. Klaatu's message that Earthlings are becoming a threat because of their militarism and nuclear weapons might be right out of today's news.

Klaatu comes in peace with a communique vital to our planet's survival and is immediately wounded by rifle fire for his efforts. After escaping from Walter Reed Hospital, Klaatu takes on the alias of Carpenter and becomes a boarder with Helen Benson (Neal). He instantly bonds with Helen's son, Bobby (Gray) and the two go on a D.C. sightseeing tour that ends at the home of Prof. Barnhardt (Jaffe). ""Carpenter"" solves a complex mathematical equation on the not-home professor's chalkboard, and leaves a note with his name and address.

Later, Carpenter/Klaatu enlists Barnhardt's aid in telling all the nations of Earth that the planet will be destroyed if a way ian't found for everyone to live in peace. He also reveals his true identity to Helen; her boyfriend, Tom (Marlowe) betrays Helen's confidence and informs the authorities of Klaatu's whereabouts, but if he's killed, robot Gort is programmed to destroy the Earth.

440953,5,6302168465,I really was disappointed at the new version of The Day The Earth Stood Still with Keanu Reeves. Mainly because of the wooden almost robotic performance by Reeves. Michael Rennie was a good actor who became GREAT in this role in 1951. Backed by legendary Patricia Neal and Sam Jaffee they produced a science fiction classic.

The movie is great, it shows how America used to be. It does show a couple of mistakes made by our military, that I found to be very funny and probably very accurate, if an event such as that actually happened. First of all let me say, I believe there is life on other planets. I don't believe we have the exclusivity of being the only creatures in the entire universe. I don't however believe we will see an event like that because other extra terrestrial beings consider us the Alabama of the Universe. Klatu brought us a gift, what did we do? We shot him for it. Thats why we will never see an event like that. Other civilizations for eons have probably discussed visiting Earth and other members of that civilization said no, they're not quite ready for a visit from us, they have a tendancy to shoot at us, we should just watch them from afar, safer that way. So, here we have a craft that is capable of visiting other planets, Klatu can render electrical power all over the world for 30min. null and void, and can also reduce our planet to a burnt out cinder, and Private Knothead shoots Klatu with a .45cal pistol? Well played Private, well played. And we continue to wonder why they won't make contact. I found the reverse side of the disc to be just about as good as the movie side of the disc, very informative. The movie was done on site, instead of a studio. This was revlutionary for it's time. The premice of the movie is that now in 1951 we earthlings have discovered nuclear weapons, as well as the ability to deliver those weapons to other countries. Now this was OK with Klatu as long as we kept it here on our planet. Seeing that Earthlings can't seem to get along with each other, and we are constantly poking our nose into someone elses business, and we at the time were experimenting with Von Braun's toy, or variations of that toy, it would not be all that long until we posed a danger to other planets, or other civilizations. This is why Klatu came here in the first place. To give us a warning, a warning that had an end of days warning. Now if this had actually happened, do you think we would have heeded the warning? Probably not. It would be nice to believe that we would have. I believe, even with the technology we posess today, in 2014, to other beings, we are just now crawling out of the caves.

A cult film at the time of release (patrons were known to shout the famous line ""Klaatu barada nikto!"" at one another as a sign that they had seen it), it provides a chilling comment on the fraught political situation at that time, in which communism was perceived as a genuine threat to world peace.  Robert Wise's tautly directed piece vividly captures the atmosphere of paranoia prevailing in the United States at that time, where governments and the media were always suspicious of people's motives and assumed that everyone not conforming to the prevailing ideology was automatically a communist.  The power of the media is also stressed, with several scenes of broadcasters communicating half-truths and outright lies to groups of credulous viewers also/or listeners.  It seems that they had the power to manipulate public opinion in precisely the way they wished.  Michael Rennie cuts an imposing presence as Klaatu - even when faced with the entire might of the US Army, we know that he will emerge unscathed.  The special effects are rudimentary by today's standards, but in thematic terms Gort - the robot - is there to show the importance of people looking after one another.

441190,5,6302168465,"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL [1951] [Limited Edition SteelBook] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] From Out of Space . . . A Warning and An Ultimatum!

A hallmark of the science fiction genre as well as a wry commentary on the political climate of the 1950s, The Day the Earth Stood Still is a sci-fi film less concerned with special effects than with a social parable. A spacecraft lands in Washington, D.C., carrying a humanoid messenger from another world [Michael Rennie] imparting a warning to the people of Earth to cease their violent behaviour. But panic ensues as the messenger lands and is shot by a nervous soldier. His large robot companion destroys the Capitol as the messenger escapes the confines of the hospital. He moves in with a family as a boarder and blends into society to observe the full range of the human experience. Director Robert Wise [West Side Story] not only provides one of the most recognisable icons of the science fiction world in his depiction of the massive robot loyal to his master, but he avoids the obvious camp elements of the story to create a quiet and observant story highlighting both the good and the bad in human nature.

FILM FACT: Well-known broadcast journalists of their time, H.V. Kaltenborn, Elmer Davis, Drew Pearson, and Gabriel Heatter, appeared and/or were heard as themselves in cameo roles. Patricia Neal, who played Helen Benson, was only 12 years older than Billy Gray, who played her son. Spencer Tracy and Claude Rains were originally considered for the part of Klaatu. Edmund H. North, who wrote The Day the Earth Stood Still, also created the alien language used in the film, including the iconic phrase ""Klaatu barada nikto"". The official spelling for the phrase comes directly from the script and provides insight as to its proper pronunciation, which you will find if you go to the Wikipedia web site.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The Day the Earth Stood Still [1951] was one of the first films out of the gate in the long cycle of 1950s American science fiction films, and perhaps along with Forbidden Planet [1956] and Invasion of the Body Snatchers [1956], it remains the one against which all of the others are measured.

A flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C., and out of it emerges Klaatu [Michael Rennie], a humanoid extra-terrestrial. He declares that he's come to earth in peace and with good will, but when he reaches into his silvery spacesuit for something, a nervous soldier shoots him in the shoulder, wounding him. In response out of the spaceship steps Gort [Lock Martin], a large, metallic anthropomorphic robot that zaps all the guns, tanks and other military hardware with a powerful laser beam shooting out of its ""eye,"" melting everything into pools of molten metal.

Klaatu is taken to Walter Reed Hospital, where the President's secretary, Mr. Harley [Frank Conroy], apologises for the misunderstanding. Klaatu informs Harley that he wants to meet with the entire world's leaders simultaneously, to deliver an urgent message from the stars concerning the future of the planet Earth. This being the height of the Cold War and among other things, Harley insists such a meeting is impossible, that the leaders of the world ""wouldn't sit at the same table together."" Frustrated, Klaatu escapes into the night, hoping to better understand the situation by living among ordinary human beings.

Assuming the alias ""Mr. Carpenter,"" Klaatu rents a room at a boarding house, where its residents, including Aunt Bee from The Andy Griffith Show, Francis Bavier, are following the story of the alien's flight with intense fear and suspicion. Francis Bavier's character is convinced it's all a Soviet plot. Only Helen Benson [Patricia Neal], a war widow, and her son Bobby [Billy Gray] think perhaps the alien is benign and that his mission might be peaceful.

Klaatu/Mr. Carpenter takes a liking to Bobby, and together they visit the home of scientific genius Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe, is a total delight here), obviously Albert Einstein in all but name. Klaatu later reveals himself to Professor Barnhardt, and together they come up with a plan to bring all the great minds of the world together so that Klaatu can at last deliver his message.

Unlike the majority of '50s sci-fi films, The Day the Earth Stood Still was a Class-A, Big Studio production. It cost about $960,000 to produce, slightly less than average for an ""A"" release in 1951, but an ""A"" nonetheless and clearly made for an adult audience. It's handsomely produced and at times very imaginative, though it does have several major flaws.

Produced at the height of Cold War hysteria and McCarthyism, The Day the Earth Stood Still suggests maybe we ought to solve our planet's ""petty squabbles"" and halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Though that seems entirely reasonable, even obvious today, back then in some circles the very suggestion was tantamount to high treason. Reviews for The Day the Earth Stood Still generally were very positive, but the film was not popular with the ""My Country  Right or Wrong"" crowd.

The film remains timely and indeed more so in the wake of 9/11 and in the way Klaatu and Gort's appearance evokes fear and paranoia among the populace, and how it's exploited and exacerbated by sensational media coverage. This may be the first Hollywood movie to extensively incorporate real newsmen into a wholly fictional story. In one interesting scene, a CNN-type on-scene reporter plays up the fear factor, but when Klaatu-as-Mr. Carpenter is coincidentally interviewed and speaks intelligently, the reporter rudely cuts him off.

Surprisingly, Klaatu's superficially sensible pacifist message plays much less so in recent years. His technologically superior society claims the same rights as the United States under the Bush Doctrine, the right to pre-emptive strike a perceived threat to its security. Certainly in 1951 and for that matter, in 2008 the threat to intelligent life elsewhere in the universe by mankind is non-existent: we simply don't yet have the technology to even reach other star systems, let alone spread like a virus our violent nature.

And yet here's Klaatu ordering us to shape up - or he'll ship us out, reducing our earth ""to a burnt-out cinder."" Forget ""regime change"" and his solution is a police state of all-powerful robots like Gort, Blackwater-like Robocops with ""absolute power over us."" I've not seen the Keanu Reeves film, but it seems like exploring the idea of Earth finding itself in the same position as countries like Iraq and Afghanistan now have with the United States would be a valid and potentially interesting approach to the material.

The film is excellent on many levels. 20th Century Fox originally wanted Claude Rains to play Klaatu, but Michael Rennie, then unknown in America, was a far superior choice. Lanky, articulate and almost ageless, projecting unusual intelligence and thoughtfulness, Michael Rennie was and is immediately acceptable as a visitor from another planet. His flat accent, somewhat more Mid-Atlantic than British, avoids tying him to a specific geographical place. Indeed, he was virtually the template for such characters, and continued playing intelligent aliens on-and-off for the rest of his life. To cite one such example of Michael Rennie's influence?

The production is handsome, with exceptionally good second unit work filmed in Washington, D.C., that director and former editor Robert Wise successfully integrates with footage shot on the 20th Century-Fox back lot and elsewhere. Wise slightly overplays the script's paralleling of Klaatu to Christ and his ""dying for our sins,"" resurrection, etc., but for the most part his direction serves the film well. Correction: As stated in the documentary and as genre historian Bill Keep Watching the Skies! Warren points out, ""Not Wise, Edmond H. North. Wise had no idea the film had Christ parallels until he was told about this in the early 1980s. He was stunned."" Thanks, Bill! The special effects are simple but just about flawless, and Bernard Herrmann's score, one of the very best ever written for a science fiction film, was monumentally influential.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Day the Earth Stood Still' black-and-white imagery has never looked better, presented here in 1080p high definition and in its original 1.34:1 aspect ratio. The film isn't razor sharp in every shot, but it still looks fantastic nonetheless, with an appreciable sense of depth, particularly during the film's opening, long-distance shots of Washington. Detail is particularly high; close-ups of articles of clothing, for example, reveal intricate textures. Blacks are deep and dark, looking particularly good at every turn. The print exhibits some spots in a few places, but the image never greatly suffers as a result. The high quality of the transfer even reveals some obvious wires at a most inopportune time that might be seen as a distraction to one of the film's most crucial sequences. Still, the film has never looked better, cleaner, more defined than and certainly never as good on large screens at home as it does here. This is no doubt the definitive home video presentation of The Day the Earth Stood Still.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox presents The Day the Earth Stood Still with the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack, in addition to the original monaural sound presentation. The stunning track makes for a vast improvement of the original mono offering, sounding fuller and more precise, noticed immediately during the film's opening credit sequence that is accompanied by the haunting notes of the Theremin. The score plays loudly and pleasantly across the front throughout the entire film. As the craft lands in Washington, the reverberations of its power can be felt permeating the entire listening area. The soundtrack produces some excellent lows within the confines of its original mix. Nothing ever sounds trumped up or phony. There is little in the way of appreciable rear channel activity, but the track does feature a few doses of low frequency effects in accompaniment of several crucial sequences. Dialogue reproduction is fabulous throughout. Much like the video presentation, listeners and long-time fans of the film will appreciate the high quality of this soundtrack.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Robert Wise and Nicholas Meyer [Director of Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan]: We start with two audio commentaries. Both were recorded together for this running, occasionally screen-specific track. For the most part, Nicholas Meyer acts as interviewer, especially during the films first half. Wise discusses some specifics of Earth such as casting, story issues, and other topics, but he often talks about his general filmmaking thoughts. He tells us how he likes to work, and while this often touches upon Earth, Robert Wise frequently digresses into other films.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Film & Music Historians John Morgan, Steve Smith, William Stromberg and Nick Redman: For the second commentary, we hear from film and music historians Josh Morgan, Steven Smith, William Stromberg, and Nick Redman. All four sit together for this running, screen-specific chat. They tell us a little about cast and crew such as Robert Wise and actor Michael Rennie, but the track usually focuses on composer Bernard Herrmann and his work. That heavy emphasis surprises me, but it succeeds. The concentration on Herrmann allows the participants to dig into his score and career pretty well, so we get a more detailed conversation than usual. Things peter out a little during the films third act, as the participants often do little more than grumble about the current state of movie music. Nonetheless, the discussion usually informs and entertains.

Special Feature: Isolated Score track 5.1 DTS: This allows us to listen to Bernard Herrmanns music in a 5.1 Dolby Digital rendition. It adds a nice bonus for the many film score fans out there.

Special Feature: The World of the Theremin [5:40] During the five-minute and 40-second piece, we hear from musician Peter Pringle. He gives us a quick history of the instrument as well as a demonstration of how it works. This turns into a cool glimpse of how the quirky instrument works. After this we get a Live Performance by Peter Pringle. It seems redundant after the prior documentary, so don't expect much from it.

Special Feature: Gort Command! Interactive Game: This requires you to move the arrows on your remote to attempt to shoot Gorts enemies. It got a bit old hat in about three minutes and I quit; it offered no enjoyment at all, only total frustration.

Special Feature: The Making of The Day The Earth Stood Still [23:51] This provides notes from Smith, Robert Wise (via archival interviews), film historian Steven Jay Rubin, producer Julian Blaustein (via archival interviews), Julian Blausteins widow Florence, The Films of Robert Wise author Richard Keenan, Wises daughter Pamela Conrad Rosenberg, Robert Wises widow Millicent, filmmaker Lewis Gilbert, aerospace historian Curtis Peebles, Auburn University Associate Professor of History Guy V. Beckwith, and actors Patricia Neal and Bobby Gray. Making looks at the cinemas roots and development, how Robert Wise came onto the project and his involvement, cast and performances, sets and locations, visual effects, music and the films impact. In Making, we get a good nuts and bolts look at the film. Its too brief to provide a terribly full examination of the flick, but then again, with two commentaries and many other documentaries available here, it doesnt need to include every element of the production. Making offers an engaging overview.

Special Feature: Decoding Klautu, Barada, Nikto: Science Fiction as Metaphor [16:13] This features Keenan, Peebles, Beckwith, Julian Blaustein, Florence Blaustein, Rubin, Wise, Gray, filmmaker Arnold Orgolini, London School of Economics International History Professor Arne Westad, producer Edmund Norths daughter Susie, and Screening Space: The American Science Fiction Film author Vivian Sobchack. Decoding examines the geopolitical climate in the early 1950s and how Earth reflects this along with some other interpretive elements. It does this in a somewhat scattershot manner, but it still provides a generally thought-provoking look at the films subtext.

Special Feature: A Brief History of Flying Saucers [33:59] This show includes remarks from Peebles, George Adamski Foundation director Glenn Steckling, UFO Religion author Gregory L. Reece, journalist/author Dr. David Clarke, UFO researcher Dennis Bathaser, Roswell Convention and Civic Center director Dusty Huckabee, International UFO Museum and Research Center executive director Julie Shuster, Witness to Roswell co-author Thomas J. Carey, Saucer Smear Newsletter editor James W. Moseley, retired radar engineer Robert Gardenghi, radar systems analyst Glenn Van Blaricum, and Abducted: How People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped By Aliens author Susan Clancy. Saucers looks at the UFO phenomenon of the 1940s/1950s and how it continued into later years.

Special Feature: The Astounding Harry Bates [2008] [11:02] During the 11-minute and two-second programme, we hear from the likes of Vivian Sobchack [Author of Screening Space: The American Science Fiction Film]; David G. Hartwell [Senior editor of Tor Books]; Bob Gay [Writer and Researcher]; Author Harry Bates [archival audio material]; Charles N. Brown [Publisher/Editor of Locus Magazine]; Lawrence Davidson [Co-author of Pulp Culture]; Steven Jay Rubin [Film Historian] and Richard Wolinsky [Radio Interviewer]. The programme gives us some biographical notes about Harry Bates as well as thoughts about Farewell to the Master and its cinematic adaptation. Apparently history hasn't left much documentation of Harry Bates life, so don't expect a ton of concise details here. Nonetheless, we do get enough interesting material to make the piece worthwhile. Directed by John Cork (uncredited) and Lisa Van Eyssen (uncredited). Produced by John Cork (uncredited) and Lisa Van Eyssen (uncredited). Writing Credits: John Cork (uncredited). Cinematography by Robert Rasmussen (uncredited).

Special Feature: Edmund North: The Man Who Made The Earth Stood Still [2008] [15:42] This special feature provides informative comments from Lewis Gilbert, Arnold H. Orgolini, Florence Blaustein, Edmund Norths daughters Bobbie North and Susie North, and film historian John Cork. As expected, the show gives us a quick biography of the films screenwriter. It proves very satisfying.

Special Feature: Race To Oblivion: A Documentary Short: Written and Produced by Edmund North [1982] [26:40] This is an archival piece arrives with the 1951 film and runs 26 minutes, 40 seconds and comes hosted by Burt Lancaster. This is a message against nuclear proliferation; and we get comments from Hiroshima survivor Shigeko Sasamori and thoughts about the medical consequences of a nuclear war. Oblivion cuts between those two elements to cover its subject. The documentary is clearly a product of its time, as fears of a nuclear battle between the US and USSR was high in the early 1980s. The possibility of nuclear war hasn't vanished, of course, but it seems less relevant today, as we have other terrors to fear. Directed by Robert B. Churchill.

Special Feature: Farewell To The Master: A Reading by Jamieson K. Price of the original Harry Bates Short Story [96:06] When a mysterious ship instantaneously appears on the grounds of the US Capitol in Washington, freelance picture reporter Cliff Sutherland is there to see it. Two days later, two passengers from the ship emerge: a godlike being in human form and an eight-foot robot made of green metal. Are the alien and his robot here to help or hinder humankind? Find out the surprising answer in the original story that inspired the classic 1951 science fiction film, The Day the Earth Stood Still. This is a must-hear for any science fiction lover, for, as The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction says, ""the film lost the story's ironic ending."" Now listeners can discover first-hand what Hollywood left out in this best-known novella by the legendary 1930s idea man Harry Bates. Long-time science fiction fans rank Farewell to the Master and its creator among the greats.

Special Feature: Fox Movietonews [1951] [6:21] It provides a six-minute and 21-second clip from 1951. In addition to a little coverage of the film, we get snippets about other news events like a Japanese peace treaty. Its a brief but neat look at contemporary history from the time of The Day The Earth Stood Still creation.

Teaser Trailer [1951] [480i] [4:3] [1:04] I have no idea why they included this trailer, as the quality is absolutely atrocious.

Theatrical Trailer [1951] [480i] [4:3] [2:09] This a totally brilliant trailer and is of top quality and is more like a short documentary.

Special Feature: Galleries: These cover Interactive Pressbook [19 screens], Advertising Gallery [11], Behind-the-Scenes Gallery [55], Portrait Gallery [17], Production Gallery [59], Spaceship Construction Blueprints [21] and Shooting Script [412]. All offer some interesting elements, but like the Pressbook which allows close-ups of some pages and the script the best. Dont expect big differences between the film and the screenplay, though; the final film follows the script pretty closely.

Finally, The Day the Earth Stood Still is a bona-fide classic both in its genre and in the annals of cinema history as a whole. The film epitomises Science Fiction like few others, creating in the viewer a sense of wonder but also conveying a socially aware message that even today remains one of utmost urgency. Robert Wise's film endures, playing both as timely and entertaining as ever. While the remake of this film is currently enjoying a high-dollar run at the box office despite its mostly negative critical reception, one must wonder for the future of what is arguably the most important and influential cinematic genre yet, one that offers viewers both what is often the peak of movie magic, witnessing first-hand the incredible, the unbelievable, the impossible, but also, perhaps, through that awe-inspiring storytelling better understanding the world as it is or once was. No doubt, like many other genres, Science Fiction seems to have taken something of a wayward turn, though films like Danny Boyle's Sunshine are able to recall the classic feel of the genre with the updated visual effects of the modern era. Thankfully, no matter what direction Sci-Fi may take next, modern technology allows for the preservation and presentation of these classics like never before, and 20th Century Fox's Blu-ray release of The Day the Earth Stood Still is certainly a benefactor of its high definition release. Audiences may enjoy this picture at the current zenith of home presentation, with a beautifully presented picture quality and several audio options, including the film's original monaural presentation, which make enjoying this classic easier and better than ever before. To top it off, Fox has seen fit to load the disc with supplemental materials that alone are worth the price of admission. That is why I am so happy to add this Special Limited Edition SteelBook, as it is a vast improvement over the previous Blu-ray release of this film. But the only thing that lets it down big time is the design of the steelbook cover, and it is absolutely abysmal design and I could of done a much better job myself. I just wish they had repeated the awesome excellent CinemaReserve Region 2 Limited Edition SteelBook DVD design and also slightly disappointed they could not have included a booklet like the Region 2 Limited Edition SteelBook DVD. Despite this slight negative comment, it is still an amazing purchase and so proud to add this Special Limited Edition SteelBook of The Day the Earth Stood Still to my extensive Blu-ray Limited Edition SteelBook Collection and easily earns my highest praise. Very Highly Recommended!

441248,5,6302168465,"The very idea of a remake of this film was horrifying.  The product itself, embarrassing.  Stick to the original and you won't be disappointed.

As with the old Twilight Zone series, you'll need to understand the American mindset of the times to get the most out of the experience.  Keeping that in mind, I understand why certain people felt it needed to be 'updated' to reflect the current culture.  Still, it ruined the legacy of an excellent, well-presented film, one that has risen far above the typically cheesy SF movies of that era.

You can't go wrong with this movie.  Well worth the price of purchase!",1389484800,,611,4.7075471698113205

The ""special effects"" were, of course, not anywhere what they are today, but the effect it should have had on us all should have ""scared us awake..."" but it didn't.  Anyone who thinks that there are not an uncountable number of other life forms in existence throughout the Universe, at various stages of development including far more advanced than are we, is in denial.  Every star we see at night in the sky is a burning ball of hydrogen as is our Sun. We see only a miniscule number of them becuase of the ambient surfice lights of our civilization. Go to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and look up at the night sky and you will be in awe; the entire sky is alight with billions of stars and the Milky Way is prominently visible to the naked eye.  Regardless of your religiosity or the religion you follow, it is blasphemous to think that God in all His or Her omnipetence created life ONLY on one small orb in the vastness of the Universe; or, that all life forms evloved at the same rate over the past 4.5 billions years since Earth coalesced into a solid mass.

It depends more on story & character development than special effects or spectacular explosions.  Classic suspense story, and has relevance in today's world of paranoid politics and global upheaval.  Gort the robot is one of the scariest characters in the movies, and he doesn't have any lines, just menacing presence.  Simple is sometimes scarier than lots of details & action, because it taps into the ""Theater of the mind"", like a good radio show.  What you imagine can be far more frightening than blood, gore, and explosions.
Bernard Herrman's score adds to the suspense and creepiness.",1388966400,,735,4.887096774193548
441287,5,6302168465,"In a story geared by world peace and the animalistic nature of Human Beings, an alien and his android come to earth to warn it of impending doom, a concept that no other hollywood film has ever grasped.

The beauty of this movie is the fact that it states that human beings are liable to destroy one another, something that was a planetary issue then, and is still potent in our day and age.

This movie requires the viewer's attention from beginning to end, it is by no means an action movie, if you're the kind of viewer who requires constant explosions and virtually no character development or plot progression, don't watch this movie and give it a negative review. This movie has a Pulp Fiction ending. rather than going out with a bang, the final scene of this movie is the leaders from all the nations of earth gathered at a rally where our alien protagonist gives a powerful speech that sums up the basic message of this film, and it's just wonderful.

One day all humanity will put aside its distrustful tendencies, and live free of the desire to engage in armed conflict.  The visitor shows this at the films conclusion.

Considering it was done in 1951, it is relevant today because it exposes mankind's inability to curb mass violence, quell hysteria, and control forces greater than armies. The 1951 special effects assist in getting the Message across.
My only criticism is when ""Gort"" leaves the spaceship grounds to retrieve the body of ""Klaatu"", there was no crowd that followed him through the city.

The Bernard Herrmann soundtrack is a little unbalanced with the dialogue in volume, but is still haunting.
The special features are excellent, including a feature that allows you to create your own ""theremin"" soundtrack which  will play in a scene from the movie.

From the Bernard Hermann score to Michael Rennie's compassionate yet determined performance on to Patricia Neal's leveled headed mom and finally ending with menacing Gort.  And don't forget Bobby, the young man that showed a visitor from another planet what we are all about.  And it all works.  I'm sure you already know about this movie or have read other reviews. So, I only have one more thing to say.
  Watching it this time I realised how much it is paced like an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  Sure, the Bernard Hermann music helps, but there are several times where it is shot and paced just like one of his earlier movies.  It isn't so staged and there is more warmth, but still.  I say this as an interesting comparison, not to say there was any copying going on.
  So, this is just as good a movie as it has always been.  You should watch it if you haven't seen it.

441643,5,6302168465,"Are we long for this world? The Day the Earth Stood Still came out in 1951. It brought science fiction films to the next level and was directed by Robert Wise. This film is thoughtful, visionary, and intelligent. It could potentially be the most important film of the 20th century.
Overall, The Day the Earth Stood Still is a very thoughtful exercise in inner cultural self-reflection. The story is about a spaceship that
lands in Washington on any given day. The humans are nervous, interested, and very excited. An alien man named Klaatu and giant robot emerge from the ship. The extraterrestrial man states that he brings an enlightened message of peace and is promptly shot down by a paranoid human soldier. Klaatu survives and attempts to send an important message to the leaders of planet earth. Unfortunately, due to issues of tension, the world leaders will essentially hear none of it. Klaatu does whatever he can to spread his word and warn the humans that the violent fighting on earth is out of control.  He tells the humans that if the inner planet turmoil continues, the planet will be doomed.
The Day the Earth Stood Still is the original science fiction cerebral cautionary tale. This film asks the viewer to question the world and make changes for the better. It is full of clever special effects and equally clever ideas. This one is a must see classic for all thinkers.",1372982400,2,1388,4.759336099585062
441644,5,6302168465,"Very clear message, one we still haven't figured out for ourselves.

This blu-ray rendition is like seeing it again for the first time. The images are crystal clear and the director's mastery of light and shadow is evident. When I was nine, it was just an interesting story. Unlike the ""Heroe's Journey"" moltif of the Star Wars films, this is  a modern-day retelling of the basic story and morality as portrayed in the New Testament. It's a bit heavy-handed and somewhat obvious to adults. A man comes from the sky and takes the name ""Carpenter."" He is a man of peace but carries the instrument of total destruction. He lives amongst us for a while before returning to his home in the sky. He leaves us with a warning to care for each other. As a nine year old I didn't get it as a work of art; a metaphor for my time. This is a film that doesn't need IMAX 3-D or CGI graphics or even Technicolor to be powerful and gripping. Michael Rennie is convincing and the other characters are equally underplayed and seem like people you know.",1371945600,,1103,4.354368932038835

The actor playing the alien robot was tall but actually rather weak and needed help, but he got the job done.  The professor was played by Sam Jaffee (Gunga Din when he was young, and later on TV in the Ben Casey series).  And two super, leading stars.  It is not the usual monsters from Mars stuff, but actually has a plot and things to think about, while still having the requisite excitement and fun.  It has to be in the top 10 list of anyone rating sci fi, and arguably would be high up in a list of top movies in general.

441683,5,6302168465,"I've loved this movie since seeing it as a kid and despite 60+ years it's still profound and still a classic. The inspiration for Robocop (Gort) and for a plethora of sci-fi movies that followed it, its leitmotif that man must live in harmony in the universe or face the consequences has only become more pronounced over time.  If you're seen the Keanu Reeves remake, which lacks the poetic impact of the original, check this out.  Both films are similar, but only one has lasting depth.",1369958400,,487,4.651162790697675
441684,5,6302168465,"If you are reading this, I'm sure you already are familiar with this classic 1950 film.  This review is about the disc format.  I have both the DVD and now the Blu-ray releases.  The video in both versions is very good with the BD edition being a little better.  The real advantage to the Blu-ray is the audio.  A purist will want to select the included original mono audio track.  I'm a long time audiophile and I find true mono audio can be a distraction as it is a flat and often unnatural sound.  After comparing both of the Blu-ray's audio tracks, I preferred the DTS surround audio.  It's not tricked out with re-engineered surround effects to emulate current films.  Instead, the DTS 5.1 track presents a full sound stage across the front three (L, C and R) speakers giving the original audio more detail and richness making this classic film all the more enjoyable.

Michale Rennie as the alien emissary, with Patricia Neal and Billy Gray who plays her son as the ones most trustworthy.  Sam Jaffe as the professor and of course Hugh Marlowe as the jealous poer hungry  boyfriend.  This movie came out at the beginning of the cold war andwas at the time a warning about nuclear power and the destruction it could creat if left unchecked.  It seems as if we were being watched not only by the Russians, but by those from other planets and galaxies.  Once the spaceship lands, the attention of the world is captured, but it still takes a small show of force to make the nations and scientist understand.

The opening photo of the robot is awesome and so I start the movie with great anticipation.  I checked the audio settings and it was in 5.1 DTS.  My big toe went stiff.  I started the movie and the chair was pulled out from beneath me.  The sound was like it was recorded in a wind tunnel.  It was worst than that, an echo chamber.  It was so bad you couldn't make out the words the actors were speaking.  The reason I rated the movie so high is because fortunately it is also recorded in 2.0 stereo and everything is cool at that setting.  I just wishing 5.1 has working, it would have been awesome.

441709,5,6302168465,"Is this the best sci-fi classic ever made? No, but it's in the top 10. The film has it's faults. ""Gort"" the robot looks like a guy in a rubber suit (He is). The spaceship looks like a large wooden set (It is). The army, as always, is clueless and heartless. However, that laser beam-eyed robot still sends chills down my spine. It all works: The uncomplicated story, the efx, the music. It's one of those movies where the sum of it is far greater than it's parts. Even the sparse interior of the spaceship holds up, and this film was made in 1951!  The timely message of peace or destruction. Far more entertaining than the recent Spielberg remake. This DVD is one of those old double-sided ones with the extras on the flip side. In the making of feature, poor Robert Wise looks terrible  with an old-age skin condition. I could hardly watch it, poor man. Fox did an excellent film restoration. The copy is crisp and new looking with few scratches. The reel change spots have been edited out.

such a good role again. To me Klaatu will remain the most impressive alien I have seen in a film,since my childhood.
There are very few special effects,the film is in black and white but it beats the modern multi million dollar productions.
From recent evidence gathered from unmanned space probes,we now know that there is no life,much less intelligent life in our Solar System (may be on planets around other stars but they are too far away for a visit).Still I continue to watch Klaatu moving about and acting with supreme confidence on my much treasured DVD.Nostalgia? perhaps.

If you've seen the ""modern"" remake of this old classic you will know the remake lacks nearly everything the original has. Story...and heavy handed CG...less than inspiring acting.

441746,5,6302168465,"Even though this film was released in 1951 it's been one of my top all-time favorites. I actually like this better than the more recent redo of the classic story about a visitor from a planet in our solar system, who has come to warn earth's inhabitants that there will be dire consequences for any of our aggressive behavior extended beyond our own planet now that we have nuclear weapons. The book was a very advanced and pertinent sci-fi drama that was superbly written and had a message that had great relevance then and does now.  Robert Wise directed the screen adaptation extremely well keeping the intrigue and suspense high through-out. Special effects were quite limited at the time, but, he managed to carry out a huge feat in that he told the story in a very human and visceral manner by using fuller character development and interaction while toning down on over the top visual concoctions or devices, that we have all grown too used to seeing in today's computer generated artificial and thusly more fake depictions leaving behind the good story in the process. The newer version with Keanu Reeves does that in spades, which really bored me with all its grandiose special effects and gibberish for dialog.  I was hoping they would attempt to remake the original film true to the basics of story and character and just make for a more exact space ship and robot leading to a more polished-up version. That would have been much more impressive to me if they had, rather than the hack job they did depending more on computer special effects and one dimensional characters' who I didn't have any feeling for let alone to be moved by!  They even had to tie in the usual PC nonsense in an attempt to make the story more current.  They would have served the story well if they had made the newer version as if set during the late 40's or early 50's at the dawn of the atomic age like the original to really connect all the dots in a suitable fashion.  After all that was the main thrust of the story, how we had just started development of atomic weapons and may at some future point in time try to extend our capabilities of aggression and nuclear power beyond our own troubled planet, which would not be tolerated! But they just went for the cheap shot and fast buck to capitalize on a true classic story and film to serve some board room executives, resulting in a botched-up film that may have made some bucks but never got off the ground and had no heart! To awe and inspire by getting the viewer to really think would have been a more noteworthy endevour, but, sadly today most decisions always come down to just the money, when in fact both demands can be met with the proper team of talented artisans who follow closely to the authors intent, as was the case in this original sci-fi masterpiece. The casting was perfect and the directing superb, while staying on target to the stories theme and author's intent.  Anyone who might never have seen either of the films or anyone who has only seen the new version will do themselves a great service to make sure they watch the original version and just enjoy it for what it is and when it was made!  Maybe someday someone will do another remake and do the story justice, but, until then I'm only going to watch this 1951 version!  The DVD comes with some very interesting extras which are entertaining in themselves and Bernard Herrmann's musical score makes the movie spring to life albeit simple black and white low tech film making by today's standards.

How flawlessly aligned are all the elements in this masterpiece of science fiction.  With Michael Rennie the perfect choice to play Klaatu.  That sad knowing smile, the parental concern for kids playing with rocks and sticks, forever locked in anger.  What a marvelous rebuke he provides, entirely wasted of course, given mankinds predilection for violence.  Still, its the thought that counts.
The movie opens with all the subtly of mass hysteria, as word of mouth announcements herald the news that something is circling the globe.  Whatever it is, its something real!  Not to mention potentially dangerous.  Unfortunately, as people, we shoot first and ask questions later.  What follows is a brilliant display of paranoia and stupidity, in equal measure.  When faced with an obvious superior power, people go at the problem with blowtorches, unlawful incarceration, and tanks.  And then cant understand why it didn't work.  Most people have a healthy respect for reprisals.
The most amusing aspect of this film was the casting of Sam Jaffe as Professor Jacob Barnhardt.  Has anyone ever looked more otherworldly!?

441841,5,6302168465,"About the film... one of the best films ever made.
And personally I only rate 2001: A Space Odyssey, higher as a science fiction... there are other great one's, Contact, Alien, Deep Impact, >>> Third Kind... and a few others.

However, I want to draw your attentions to a couple of ideas not discussed in the 20 or so... reviews that I read.

Our visitor from another world that is apparently close enough to be called a ""neighbors,"" says very clearly, in effect: 'you will be killed and the Earth destroyed if you don't do as we instruct.'

I mention this not just to counter the line of thought in the reviews here that this is really about Cold War ""paranoia"" or Cold War Propaganda or even a sensitive and enlightened being from another world. Well... it certainly is about propaganda.

Mentally...put the director and writer and others in a column. Then read about how the FED was set up and by whom. Read who was the first N.Y. Fed Chairman (Chairman of the FED in those days) and about his brother Max, the head of German Intelligence during WW1 while his brother was head of the FED... your read that right.

WW1 was financed in effect... BOTH sides... by the new toy of the Banking Cartel... the IRS... set up directly after 'THE DAWN OF THE FED!' (a horror story looking for a movie) had passed Congress.

After the Russian and Turkish empires were brought to their knees and Germany staggered... by the end of WW1... the glorious ""League of Nations"" was proffered as a solution to war.
Only one thing went wrong on the way to World Government... the Senate of the USA... gave it a thumbs down, by a vast majority.

So what to do? Well have another World War! First... the financing of Hitler by... the English American banking houses... and by the end of the WW11 Germany and Japan destroyed, the countries that rivaled England and the USA and their rulers the Banking Elite.

Also, the armies of the West were stopped purposefully before Berlin (Patton)... who just happened to run out of gas... allowing the Soviets eventually... to take what became Eastern Europe. This caused considerable concern in the Early 50s as well as deep and valid... suspicions.

AND of course two completely unnecessary atomic bombings of two cities in Japan... to end WW11 with a final trauma event... . Leaving... a very frightened population in America and around the world... and a few years later with the help of a certain group... Communism achieved the atomic bomb WAY before anyone thought possible.

Today we know the American Manhattan Project's plans for the bomb were in Russia DAYS... after their completion. Paranoia or the ""Red Scare"" is only paranoia or a scare if not true... .

The warning in the movie... was not from space... it was a warning to America and to the West and really to humanity... that they would be exterminated... if they dared resist... an enlightened... if involuntary... reorganization... of Earth.

Discipline ... was carried out on Nov. 22nd, 1963 and on 9/11/01.

Still... a GREAT movie in its own right... wonderful acting and the propaganda is so subtle and yet so thick... that it is fascinating to watch in light of proceeding historical events.",1359676800,2,3185,4.717117117117117

Filmed entirely on the FOX backlot (except for a few 2nd unit shots of D.C.), no one at the time could have imagined that THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL would reach legendary status and remain there almost 60 years later.

The story of the arrival in the U.S. capital city of alien Klaatu and his policeman robot Gort remains relevant to this day. Klaatu's message that Earthlings are becoming a threat because of their militarism and nuclear weapons might be right out of today's news.

Klaatu comes in peace with a communique vital to our planet's survival and is immediately wounded by rifle fire for his efforts. After escaping from Walter Reed Hospital, Klaatu takes on the alias of Carpenter and becomes a boarder with Helen Benson (Neal). He instantly bonds with Helen's son, Bobby (Gray) and the two go on a D.C. sightseeing tour that ends at the home of Prof. Barnhardt (Jaffe). ""Carpenter"" solves a complex mathematical equation on the not-home professor's chalkboard, and leaves a note with his name and address.

Later, Carpenter/Klaatu enlists Barnhardt's aid in telling all the nations of Earth that the planet will be destroyed if a way ian't found for everyone to live in peace. He also reveals his true identity to Helen; her boyfriend, Tom (Marlowe) betrays Helen's confidence and informs the authorities of Klaatu's whereabouts, but if he's killed, robot Gort is programmed to destroy the Earth.

Michael Rennie is believable as an alien who tries to be understanding with the foolish human race, and I really like Patricia Neal, going from mostly disinterested mother, to scared victim, to strong figure and advocate for peace. And her bad half, Hugh Marlowe, acting as if he's right here in the 2010 decade, where anyone with a gimmick can capture the media & be a star for a few minutes. Unfortunately, too many open problems that take away a large measure of believability - only two guards on watch on the perimeter of the spaceship? Gort gets Rennie back to the ship from prison unseen??  And in the space of a few minutes, it seems, and ahead of the large gathering of scientists and after an extended chase by the military? Not so real.

441887,5,6302168465,"I went to see this movie when it first came out, with my Mom and older sister. We were highly impressed. We lived in Roswell, New Mexico at the time and we saw it at the Chief Theater, which is now the UFO Museum in Roswell. We were stunned by the movie. The idea that a person, entity, from outer space could come visit Earth and dictate terms to us mere, helpless Earthlings, really shocked us. Mother was really impressed. My sister and I talked about the film, even discussing it occasionally to this very day. People today have no concept of how stunning such a concept as this film depicts was for people of the early 50's. It was a much simpler time. We never even noticed any of the oddly incompatible portions of the script- such as the very idea the government had Klaatu in their very hands and yet, somehow, failed to take a single photograph of him for spreading around public places during the manhunt for him after he escaped. Also, the government agent sent to talk to Klaatu in the hospital had nothing of any real importance to discuss with the very technically advanced alien. We never even questioned Klaatus decision to skip out of government contact and endanger himself and the public as a fugitive, seeking to do what? Negotiate with and deliver a message to the very people he was in contact with in the first place! Oh, well. Also, we never made the Christian religious connection, which today seems so overtly obvious. My God, the alien even called himself ""Mr. Carpenter""! They were beating the audience over the head with it and yet, we just were not that sophisticated enough in the day to catch what the writers were pitching- to us, it was just a creepy kind of sci-fi adventure. I was mighty impressed with the silver man, Gort, and even painted an old pair of levies silver trying to make my own Gort suit, using a silver painted bucket as a helmet. It was impressive, scary, interesting and even creepy. We actually would sit outside at night watching the sky and talking endlessly about the possibilities of a visit from outer space and what the creatures would look like. We never really believed they would be nearly as humanoid and friendly as Klaatu. The film is captivating, somewhat interesting in the genre and, I think, important in both concept for sci-fie and message. I give it five stars- Oh, and it beats the Reeves version all to smoke!

I'll have to go with the 2008 version because this 1951 version is so dated by comparison. Although Michael Rennie as Klaatu is arguably superior to Keanu Reeves, I like the fish-our-of-water approach Reeves took, sort of Spock-like. Basically, the 2008 version took everything about this version and made it better: color, drama, f/x, Gort, the Christian typology and the spectacular apocalyptic climax.

That said, this '51 version was great for its time and is definitely worthy of one's video library. It has a nice eerie 50's sci-fi score.

Some parts of this version are just lame and boring, but I found it interesting to see how the USA was back in 1950, the way people dressed and talked, etc. Other than that, though, the 2008 version is leagues superior in every conceivable way.

The point being nothing has changed and film intends to warn Earth's occupants to stop the aggression before its too late.  The interactions between the charactors are stereo-typical for the time but never the less the human nature element is captured and that will remain. Please watch and enjoy the story and take the message to heart. Robert Wise is well known for his ability to make a film into a wonderful piece of art. Sam Jaffe was perfectly cast as was Rennie. Gort, the robot, must have the ability to vanish and reappear. The viewer may wonder how Gort was able to leave the landing site , move across town to the police station, break Klatu from the cell, and return to the ship unnoticed.

441894,5,6302168465,"First of all, anyone who was involved in the making of this outstanding film or their estates should have sued for defamation of character everyone involved in the absolutely horrendous 2008 remake, a ""remake"" in title only.  If you believe the 2008 travesty was anything remotely like this classic film and use that as the reason not to watch the original 1951 film with the same title, you will be missing one of the very best science fiction films ever made.

The director of this film is Academy Award-winner Robert Wise who also directed, most notably, The Sound of Music and West Side Story.

The outstanding soundtrack is by Academy Award-winner Bernard Herrmann who also created the scores for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, North by Northwest, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and Vertigo. He composed notable scores for many other movies, including Citizen Kane, Cape Fear, and Taxi Driver and for TV shows such as Rod Serling's Twilight Zone.

Combine on black and white film the outstanding direction, acting and soundtrack with a great story and you have a science fiction film noir classic, one that I personally prefer even over another classic sci-fi film from the same period, ""Forbidden Planet.""  I have watched ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" far more times than any other sci-fi film and it never gets old.  It's simply brilliant.",1350086400,2,1340,4.907079646017699

Despite all the scifi films I've watched and loved over the years, this film has oddly grown to be my favorite of the genre. There is such an elegance and a beautiful economy to the storytelling. There doesn't seem an unnecessary action or line in the entire film, just this wonderful awe and intelligence and tension throughout. The cast is first-rate, and Michael Rennie was a brilliant choice for Klaatu. And as much as I like The Sound of Music and other films by Robert Wise, I think this is his finest. His direction is impeccable here; the story's subject matter and pacing fitting his directing style to a T.

The message, of course, is just as poignant today as it was then -- and leaving the ending hanging with the audience makes it all that more sterling an accomplishment.

And I haven't even mentioned Bernard Herrmann's masterful innovative score, which was groundbreaking for its day, and so oft repeated in the decades to come that here it begins to border on the cliche. But even then it remains above the musical fray, adding so beautifully to the wonderful mystery and atmosphere of the story, and melding film and music in a way rarely achieved.

441914,4,6302168465,"This movie, a Christian allegory (the name Klaatu adopts on Earth is 'Carpenter', get it?) is on the face of it a rather simple little scifi story, requiring considerable suspension of disbelief. Would a spaceship sitting in the middle of Washington be guarded by nobody except a couple of squaddies? Would an 8-foot robot be able to walk through the streets of Washington to the morgue, retrieve a dead body and carry it back to the spaceship without anybody noticing? Nevertheless, more than 60 years on, it still exerts considerable fascination and respect, as the reviews show. Why is this?

Well, first is the atmosphere director Robert Wise creates. For a movie with such a grandiose theme, it's surprisingly intimate. Being shot in black and white mutes the more spectacular special effects and many of the scenes involve quiet conversations. There's a feeling about the movie that it is telling us something about ourselves, not just providing a visual experience. Next, there's the acting and, in keeping with Wise's low-key approach, the acting is understated, apart from a few scenes. Michael Rennie, in particular, gives a very controlled performance as Klaatu. He's quiet, a little gloomy, but more sad than angry at the reception he gets on Earth, even though the first action of the people he has come to enlighten is to shoot him. A very fine performance by a great actor. The other really good thing about the movie is its pacing and balance. At 92 minutes, it's a short film, but there's so little filler in it that it has more content than many much longer movies. It shifts quickly but surely from scene to scene, each evoking different emotions- suspense, horror, empathy, even humor.

Even today, when this might be just another 1950s 'they came from another planet' story, the movie repays rewatching and the feeling it inspires is not laughter at its antique special effects and ridiculous premise, but thoughtfulness and maybe some unease as it describes only too accurately the way in which we are still behaving.

441938,5,6302168465,"In my previous Best Movie reviews, I've mentioned scenes that I believe to be the heart of those films, the essential expression of their nature. In La Belle et La Bete, it's the scene where Belle and the Beast walk together in the garden for the first time. In Bad Day At Black Rock, it's the scene where Macreedy delivers a karate chop to Trimble, proving that one-armed war veterans should not be underestimated by small-town thugs.

In The Day The Earth Stood Still, it's the scene where Klaatu signals Gort with the flashlight, then enters his spaceship, while Bernard Herrmann's incomparable score plays in the background (a segment called Nocturne/The Flashlight/The Robot/Space Control). With no dialog, it manages to convey a supreme sense of wonder as we're invited into that alien ship to glimpse the Unfathomable.

Like Rear Window, The Day The Earth Stood Still has no wasted scenes, every frame counts. The difference is that the score for The Day The Earth Stood Still is an integral part of the movie - it's essential to help tell the story. Movies like this are one of the reasons music videos eventually became so popular - images and sounds, when combined, are powerful storytellers.

In a way, it's surprising this movie ever got made. It's based on a classic science fiction story, ""Farewell To The Master,"" (Harry Bates, 1940) which has a very different plot. Only the basic premise of an alien visitation remains the same, and the fact that there's a robot. These are nerdy elements, and in those days they were usually relegated to the realm of the B movie. Yet The Day The Earth Stood Still was made by an A-list director, Robert Wise - which is why it also earned an A-list composer for the score, and an excellent cast and script (Edmund H. North).

Many people have seen a parallel to the storyline of the film and the Jesus parable, with Klaatu as the Messiah. At one point, he is killed and resurrected. But though Klaatu is ethical and wise beyond Human standards, his message is not one of joy and peace. Basically he's on Earth to tell us: Look, you're a bunch of destructive yahoos. If you're so petty and foolish that you have to keep killing each other, that's your business. But if you bring your conflicts out into space, we'll blast you into oblivion. The choice is yours.

He doesn't deliver that ultimatum until the very end of the movie - up until that point, most of the humans he encounters spend their time proving that his lack of faith in us is utterly justified. People react fearfully, and the government fails to approach Klaatu with diplomacy (they opt for the Scorched Earth approach). A few of the people he meets manage to win him over. You never get the impression that he hates us, just that he's disappointed that we can't grow up and get a clue. Heck, I'm disappointed by that, too. Being a member of the Human Race is like having a cousin who's a great guy - unless he's drinking.

Both Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal give their characters extraordinary depth. They come from a time when ""The Theater"" included plays acted on stage. In the early days of Hollywood, casting directors recruited heavily from a stable of extremely well- trained and talented character actors from that earlier tradition. This is one of the things that puts the Day The Earth Stood Still in a category above many of the Science fiction B films of that era (fun and imaginative though they could be).

The special effects are fairly minimal - just some minor animation when Gort disintegrates guns and tanks (also a soldier or two when the going gets tough). Everything else is camera angle, lighting, great editing, perfect music. I'll take these old-fashioned psychological effects over CGI any day.

Beyond the fact that it's a great Science Fiction movie, The Day The Earth Stood Still has a personal dimension for me. The first time I saw it, I was about eight years old, and my father didn't live with us. He and my mother had divorced a few years before, but I didn't know that. He served in the air force, and the Viet Nam war was still going on. I knew my father was deployed there, so I assumed he wasn't home because he was fighting in that war. I was only half right.

In the movie, Klaatu befriends a boy. His behavior toward that boy is fatherly, and I've always sensed a bit of romance between Klaatu and Patricia Neal's character. When I saw Klaatu get into his ship at the end of the movie and fly away, leaving the woman and her boy behind, it broke my heart. It still does, every time I see it.

That's why this movie makes the A list - and my list of greatest movies ever.",1343001600,,4631,4.575392038600723
441939,3,6302168465,"The Blu-ray edition of this 1951 classic sci-fi film is welcome indeed.
The quality of the video is generally an improvement to the previous DVD release.  Most shots show the expected improvement in clarity, others do not.  All shots drawn from file footage will not display the sharpness possible with studio created takes but it is generally satisfactory, except for one discrepancy.  The frame aspect ratio given in Amazon's specification for the product is given as 1.37:1.  This is what is also stated in the IMDb specification for the film.  All sound theatrical films produced after 1931 were shown in an aspect ratio of 1.37:1 which is referred to as the ""Academy Aperture.""  However,  the product package for this film states the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 which was the standard ratio for non-anamorphic films  released to DVD.  This is the aspect ratio for the NTSC television standard and was used for all non-anamorphic displays on DVD.  The aspect ratio for this film on Blu-ray should have been released in the 1.37:1 aspect ratio.  I took a measurement on my screen display and confirmed that it is 1.33:1.
Warner Home Video released ""The Wizard of Oz"" in Blu-ray in the 1.37:1 aspect ratio although the packaging for that product incorrectly states it as being in the 1.33:1 ratio.  I checked that also on my display and confirmed that it is, in fact in 1.37:1 as it should be.

Apparently some studios are reprocessing these older films on Blu-ray in the correct 1.37:1 aspect ratio and some are not.  TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT APPARENTLY DID NOT CHOOSE TO RELEASE THE BLU-RAY DISC OF ""THE DAY THE EARTH  STOOD STILL"" IN ITS CORRECT ASPECT RATIO OF 1.37:1 .

The soundtrack appears to have been remixed to a considerable degree with sound effects and music somewhat louder relative to the dialog than any of the previous releases of this film and most likely what was originally heard in theaters.  Some users may find this a source of irritation, others may not.  The tonal balance of the Bernard Herrmann music score has been altered and has been given stereo aspects which the original film shown in theaters certainly did not have.",1342224000,4,2164,4.8501362397820165
441940,5,6302168465,"Since Amazon has tended to bundle their reviews to multiple products, allow me to clarify that this review is of the blu-ray edition of 1951's The Day the Earth Stood Still.

Without getting too spoiler-y for those who haven't seen this film, TDTESS concerns a visiting extraterrestrial humanoid, Klaatu - the people he meets, the ""civilization"" he observes, and the obstacles he must overcome to deliver a message to humankind.

This film has been analyzed from multiple artistic, political, and religious angles.  It has been praised as a paean to peace, and condemned as endorsing fascism.  The story is told with such simplicity and is so universal that nearly anyone can apply their own philosophy to it - as evidenced by some reviews here.  Let me write bluntly that the 2008 remake is not the equal of the 1951 version in any way - except for advancement in visual effects.

Michael Rennie brings a special sense of alien-ness to the role of Klaatu, at first detached, then bemused, then horrified by human behavior - finally concerned for his human friends, Helen and Robby.  Rennie and Patricia Neal bring a lovely sense of chaste romance to their scenes.  Sam Jaffe was perfectly cast as the quasi-Einstein character.  There isn't a trace of artifice to Billy Gray's portrayal of young Bobby.  The performances and the deceptive simplicity of Robert Wise's directing serve to amplify the dialog: In a scene where Klaatu learns that many buried at Arlington National Cemetery died in wars, he tells Bobby that where he comes from, there are no wars.  Bobby's innocent response is enough to bring tears to nearly anyone.

The black and white video quality is excellent, with sharp detail.  The film elements have been thoroughly cleaned, yet not to the extent that natural grain has been suppressed.  There are numerous details now visible that I've been unable to see previously, including seams where the ramp to Klaatu's ship retracts, and details of backgrounds such as wallpaper.  No attempt has been made to improve on the visual effects, most of which hold up well, but the wires used to help Gort lift Helen after she utters the film's most famous line are still visible.  The original mono soundtrack has been expanded to surround, but the engineers have shown appropriate restraint - and the mono track is also included for purists.  French and Spanish tracks are also available, but some parts of the latter inexplicably replace Bernard Herrmann's superb music.

The bonus features alone are worth the cost of the disc:
*Two commentary tracks: one with Nicholas Meyer and director Robert Wise; the other concentrating on the music;
*Isolated Score;
*Shooting script - particularly interesting for comparison, with several humorous moments that did not make the final cut;
*Dramatic reading of the short-story ""Farewell to the Master"" - upon which the film was based;
*Documentary on ""Farewell"" author Harry Bates, TDTESS producer Edmund North, and the making of TDTESS;
*North's short documentary Race to Oblivion;
*Theremin demonstration videos, plus a score-the-scene game;
*Gort target practice game;
*Multiple galleries, including rare color photographs;
*Two trailers, and premiere footage.

441941,4,6302168465,This is another classic movie to add to our collection.  We love these old movies to watch with a bowl of popcorn.,1338595200,,114,4.181818181818182
441942,5,6302168465,"To begin with, this is the 1951 version of the movie that I'm reviewing.  Not the remake.  The remake ""starred"" Keanu Reaves, and will probably not be remembered in 10 years.

This movie, however, will be remembered in another 50, because its settings, characters, story and message are so timeless.  I've heard people say they were simple, but there's often something very sobering and essential hidden within that kind of simplicity.

A saucer lands in Washington DC in the 1950s, and an alien being; Klaatu, emerges from it, claiming to come in peace, and saying that he has a message, which must be heard by every person on Earth.  After failing to convince the world leaders to gather and hear his message, he disguises himself as an earthman named Carpenter and goes looking for answers; trying to understand Earthpeople a bit better before he makes his next choice.

The relationships that Klaatu develops with the people he meets are interesting and fun to watch, and this is where much of the story takes place.  The ultimate necessity of his message being received, and his eventual departure from Earth, however, are always looming in the background; calling him back to his mission, because according to Klaatu, the very safety of the world could be at stake.

A lot of other interesting things, and a few exciting things happen in this film over the course of Klaatu's visit, but three elements in particular make me like this film a great deal more than other sci-fi films from this time period.

First, Klaatu's relationship with other human beings, and his love of goodness, intelligence and maturity helped me to like the character, and to sympathise with his predicament.  At no point does he fall into any of the cliches that often plague other sci-fi protagonists.  He's not emotionless, or cold, or frantic, or ruthless.  He doesn't, in fact, come across as anything but a very decent man, who's terrified that he may be forced to cross a moral line in order to accomplish his mission.  This is the first reason I liked this film.  I liked and understood its main character.  He's not eager to cause trouble, but neither is he a delusional hippie-type, who thinks that peace can be made by just singing or emoting together.  He wants peace, but he knows you need to sacrifice to get it.  I often feel like him in my ordinary life.

Secondly, Klaatu is himself religious, after a fashion; a rare thing in sci-fi aliens.  He doesn't refer to any specific religion.  His acknowledgment of ""the almighty spirit"" could even imply deism, but it's so brief, that it doesn't really imply anything, except, of course, that he's not an atheist.  This alone would earn another star from me.  In this culture, we often assume that if aliens exist, they'll all be super-advanced atheists with no God concepts of any sort, and to be honest, I've never found this image convincing.

Thirdly, Klaatu's message, and his speech to mankind.  Some might consider his ultimatum a bit harsh, though remember; it's not his to give.  Still, many people would say things like ""Wait a minute!  That means we don't get to do whatever we want anymore!  That's dictatorial!  Boo!""  However, these people, I think, are missing the point.

The problem with dictatorships (and with democrasies, really,) has always been that no human being or group of human beings can be trusted to run them properly.  This, I think you'll agree, is not a factor with the form of government that Klaatu's people chose.

Furthermore, anyone who disagrees with Klaatu from the perspective of wanting unrestricted freedom must be a very wicked person indeed; especially if they've lived through any part of the last three decades.  Klaatu's message is, in many ways, more pertinent now than it was in the days of the 1950s, because we've seen the horrors that total freedom from all constraint and natural law bring; the endless abandonment of one another, the tyranny of our own whims, the debauchery and depravity of the frantic search for the next ""fix"" of illicit pleasure; it's all become an everyday occurrance as the 21st century dawns.  People don't deserve the chance to act irresponsibly, because when they do, they only hurt one another.  They need some authority figure to honor and listen to; someone they can trust to give them right guidance.  This truth is distinctly human.

This, I think, is the main reason I liked this film so much.  It doesn't just speak to the decent man, or the religious man.  It speaks to the human experience.

We've become so sensitive and touchy now; we humans.  We bark like dogs at anything that seems to present a ""heavy-handed"" or ""unsubtle"" message... as though we consisted of nothing more than feelings; to be utterly destroyed by the slightest pang of genuine sadness or guilt.  This is the real tragedy of the modern age; the raging, militant refusal to face our problems, so that the vast majority of people can't even appreciate simple pleasures like this film, which should be a stunning affirmation of human virtue and what's needed to preserve it.

But if you're on the other side of that moral line, you may find this movie burdensome and appalling, and that truly makes me sad.  If so, it's not that there's something wrong with the movie; but with the heart receiving the message.

The scope of the problem in the modern world is much bigger than it was in Klaatu's time, and we still don't have any concrete plan for solving it; less now than ever, in some ways.  The remnant needs a close encounter like this every so often to cheer them up and remind them that there's still a larger world; spared the ravages of evil and war, and if people who don't want to listen to that message don't want to hear it, then that's entirely their problem.",1337126400,4,5775,4.757788944723618
441943,4,6302168465,"This is probably the one science fiction film all baby boomers remember. It is THE classic. As the story opens, a flying saucer has been spotted all over the world, orbiting the planet at some 4,000 mph. After everyone is already in a panic, it lands on the mall in Washington, DC. Out comes Klaatu (Michael Rennie) in his lovely silver space suit, and Gort, his giant robot. Of course the military has the space surrounded, and when Klaatu reaches inside his garment for what turns out to be a gift for the president, a trigger-happy soldier shoots him. Then Gort melts a few guns and a tank, so everyone knows he's dangerous.

Klaatu is taken to Walter Reed Hospital, where he is visited by the president's personal assistant. He tells the envoy he wishes to speak to all the heads of state of the world. He suggests the United Nations, but the envoy points out that it does not represent all the countries. It will not do: Klaatu must speak to everyone at the same time.

When he is already healed up the next day, and the envoy cannot provide any optimism for his plan to speak to everyone, the Army guards lock him in. He just smiles. When the nurse and orderly come to bring him his dinner, the door is unlocked and he is gone.

He assumes the name Mr. Carpenter, based on the dry cleaner's tag that was on the suit he stole, and goes to a boarding house to rent a room. (One of the other boarders is our dear Aunt Bee, Frances Bavier.) Also living there are a widow (Patricia Neal) and her son (Billy Gray). Billy makes friends with Mr. Carpenter, and takes him to see the sights of Washington.

Carpenter asks Billy who the smartest man in the world is, and he decides it's Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), and takes Carpenter to see him. The professor is not in, but there's a chalk board with a problem in celestial mechanics over which the professor has been puzzling for weeks. Carpenter makes some check marks and adds a comment and a formula. As he is just finishing this, the professor's housekeeper comes in and starts hollering at him. He quickly puts his name and address on a slip of paper and hands it to the housekeeper. He asks her to give that to the professor, as ""He'll want to talk to me.""

That evening, Carpenter gets a visit from a G-man. He is taken to Professor Barnhardt, and reveals his true identity to him. The professor agrees to get together a group of scientists and ""the best minds"" so that Klaatu can address them all at once. As a demonstration of the power they are facing, Klaatu agrees to provide something spectacular that won't harm anyone.

He does. But when he goes to the spaceship to set it up, Billy follows him. So he knows who Mr. Carpenter is, and tells his mother and her boyfriend when they come home. He also shows them the two diamonds Mr. Carpenter ""sold him"" for two dollars. The boyfriend found another on the floor of Carpenter's room. When he has it appraised the next day, the jeweler is amazed, and offers him a good price for it.

At precisely noon that day, all electrical power is neutralized. Not just the kind that comes over wires, but all battery and other sorts of electrical power as well. Only hospitals and airplanes in flight are unaffected. At noon, Klaatu is in an elevator with Billy's mother, and so he has to explain who he is. Since she had not believed Billy's story of following Carpenter until she saw that his shoes were all wet, she is now prepared to believe Carpenter. He tells her that if anything happens to him she should go to the ship and tell Gort, ""Klaatu Barada Nicto.""

At 12:30 when the electricity comes back on and the elevator works, they get a cab to go home, but are diverted when they see police and military all around their house. The bad guys are closing in, and while Billy's mom gets away, Klaatu is shot and killed. She runs to Gort and delivers her message. Gort takes her into the spaceship, then goes and breaks Klaatu out of the police station where he'd been taken. Gort carries him to the ship and puts him in a device that restores him to life.

Then he goes out of the ship and addresses the crowd of ""the best minds."" He comes from another planet, he says, though he will not say which one. He explains that they have learned to live in peace, and use robots like Gort as their police. The robots' powers are ""irrevocable."" Since the people of earth are known to be violent, they basically have two choices: they can learn to live peaceably under the watchful eye of the robots like Gort, or the earth will be destroyed.

Most people see this as a message of peace. I see it as a message of ultimatum. We are to believe that the robots are to be trusted, but why? Is it really a good thing to submit to such a set-up? Great minds have debated the concept ever since 1951.

Even seen in the context of when it was made (early in the Korean ""conflict""), it is just a little too pat, a little to condescending. But it's film history, and it is a good movie; a great one for its time, but a good one even today.",1337126400,,5028,4.366844919786097
441944,4,6302168465,"The Day The Earth Stood Still is a classic sci-fi movie with a powerful cautionary message which, sadly, still rings true with the world's current situation. The movie is very well-filmed: special effects -although not many, are impressive (especially the scenes in the beginning of the film like the time when Gort zaps the tank); Bernard Herrmann's score is absolutely amazing, almost hypnotic; his use of theremins creates an eerie atmosphere which the movie needed. I recommend this Blu-ray movie to any sci-fi fan. Both video and audio quality are great despite its being black and white and made in 1951. There are a lot of extras, commentaries, ""making of"" featurette.

However, the movie is not without flaws. There are a few things about the plot that didn't feel consistent enough. Klaatu leaves the earth without obtaining any sort of confirmation from the world leaders that they will work towards peace. He is talking to a group of scientists who have no authority about government's decisions. It feels as if he could have made his speech at the  beginning and leave. He doesn't achieve anything by coming to earth except for delivering the message. Another problem for me was the scene in the beginning where Klaatu gets shot. Klaatu is very smart; he should have foreseen that he would be perceived as a threat in his unearthly costume holding an unknown device in his hand as he walks toward the soldiers. It felt like a convenient plot device to get him to hospital and build up for the second act. I also feel that his message at the end loses its effectiveness due to the fact that he already relayed the exact same message before. His final speech at the end was supposed to be climax of the movie but since we already heard it before, it didn't have that effect. The movie's power comes from its portrayal of humans, not aliens. The movie uses Klaatu as a mirror to show human's irrationality, their paranoia and fear of each other.

Overall, I love the film and recommend this Blu-ray to any sci-fi fan.",1336089600,,2026,4.73371104815864
441965,5,6302168465,"""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is a classic science fiction film, released in 1951. I consider it one of the best movies ever made. It works eminently well even today, despite the rather shaggy special effects (or complete lack of them). *Of course* the 2008 re-make was much worse. In contrast to most fans, however, I liked the re-make as well (I think it was quite clever. Besides, I'm partial to John Cleese!).

I'm more ambivalent to the message of the original film. Perhaps it's pointless to criticize a message so obviously connected to the Zeitgeist in 1951, but I can't say I like it. Stripped of all the cosmic rhetoric, the alien visitor Klaatu really calls for a stronger United Nations Organization, which will use deadly force against everyone threatening ""peace"". Really? But who watches the watchers, I wonder? Also, Klaatu implies that ""war"" in general is something negative, pointless and primitive - and this in a movie from 1951, just six years after the end of World War II, when the Western powers and the Soviet Union (correctly) united against Nazi Germany. Many other examples of righteous wars could be mentioned: what about the war against the slavocracy in the American South, for instance? Or what about the wars of national liberation in the Third World after the end of World War II? They obviously threatened ""peace"". But so what? The movie says nothing about the threat of the great powers to smaller nations, nothing about social justice, etc. It simply calls for ""peace"", apparently policed by an even greater power (the robots).

It's richly ironic that when Klaatu calls for peace, he can only do so by threatening humanity with an even more powerful military force...

In the re-make, Klaatu is more new agey and wants humans to transform on a spiritual level. That may be just as nave, but somehow it does feel as an improvement on the original message, with its implicit craving for authoritarian One World Government. I mean, a robotic peace force threatening everyone with annihilation unless they behave?!

But, as I said, none of this diminishes the stature of this elegantly made sci fi flick. On a more humorous note, I noticed that Professor Barnhardt looks vaguely like Einstein!

Incidentally, it's also interesting to speculate about the connection between ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and the contactee phenomenon. Did the movie inspire contactees such as George Adamski? Or was it the other way around? Or was it some kind of cross fertilization? After all, the aliens supposedly encountered by the contactees also warned us about the dangers of nuclear power and war. However, they also peddled a warped form of Theosophy. By contrast, Klaatu is a pseudo-Christian monotheist. In 1951, the New Age didn't even exist, and similar notions were very countercultural.

In his book ""UFOs - the Greatest Mystery"", Hillary Evans speculates that the scene where GORT resurrects Klaatu may have inspired stories of alien abduction, which often include a medical examination. I'm not sure whether this speculation makes any sense, however.

To sum up, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is both a entertaining adventure story, a look into a mindset long gone, and (possibly) an important part of the origins of the UFO subculture.

Klaatu barada...five stars.",1328313600,6,3304,4.994545454545454
441966,5,6302168465,"I've watched the original The Day The Earth Stood Still  at least 20 times. The relative unknown to US audiences British actor Michael Rennie played Klaatu( the spaceman in the silver suit from the flying saucer) and the known movie star Patricia Neal played Helen. Gort the huge robot was played by Lock Martin who was 7ft 7in tall.

The movie is in B/W and the sound is very good. To me the movie being B/W was not a subtraction. Almost all the actors/actresses are now dead so this movie is also of historical significance.

I love quality Science Fiction and have read hundreds of Sci Fi books and watched dozens and dozens of Sci Fi movies. INMO the original The Day The Earth Stood Still is in the top 5 Sci Fi movies of ALL time. The plot and acting were superb! There is some limited special effects but nowhere near the amount of special effects in today sci fi movies. To create this QUALITY Sci Fi movie great acting was needed and Michael Rennie playing Klaatu, Patricia Neal playing Bobbie's mother and Sam Jaffe playing Professor Barhardt were superb. These INMO was the highlight of the movie...the superb plot and great acting. The special effects were first class for 1950ish technology but were secondary.

This movie was put out during the height of the cold war when many people were watching the sky and afraid of a nuclear exchange between the US and the USSR. There is even a talk in the movie of the spacecraft being from the soviets by the actress who played Aunt Bea in the Andy Griffin television series.

I won't ruin the movie for you. A flying saucer type spacecraft lands near the White House and Michael Rennie comes out of the ship holding a gift to view life on other worlds for the President but is shot by a soldier and the gift destroyed. Out of the ship comes the giant robot Gort to save Klaatu. Gort disintegrates some soldiers guns, tanks and artillery. Klaatu deactivates Gort before he can disintegrate all the soldiers. Klaatu is taken to an army hospital,the bullet is removed and his wound dressed ; and he escapes. He makes friends with a boy named Bobbie and his mother Helen played by Patricia Neal. Klaatu helps Professor Barnhardt with advanced propulsion equations and shows the world leaders the power he commands ...Klaatu zaps the world for 1/2 hour. No electricity  world wide except emergency life sustaining power...the Earth stands still. Later Klaatu and Helen try to get to the ship for a meeting with the worlds scientists via taxicab. Klaatu is hunted by the military, gunned down and killed , but he is brought back to the ship and brought back life for an unknown limited time by the robot Gort. Helen must stop Gort before he destroys the Earth. Klaatu gives the assembled scientists the ultimate ultimatum; that if the world ....I won't ruin the great ending.

This is  some of the best ever Science Fiction. A true ultimate classic. If you like quality Sci Fi this DVD of the original The Day the Earth stood Still is a must have to add to your collection. Our family viewed the new The Day the Earth Stood Still with the flying nanobots eating everything and killing people. The special effects  were better but the acting and plot were nowhere as good as the original.

Just look at the hundreds of other 5 star reviews by other reviewers! The original the Day the Earth stood still on DVD rated 5 stars plus.",1324857600,4,3379,4.588723051409619
441967,4,6302168465,"Ah, the good old days when movies did NOT have today's three-fold magic formula of sex scenes, attacks on biblical religion, and outright perversion.  My kids saw it with me, as it was something today's adult films hardly ever are--clean.  I mean this was 1951, right?

I really enjoyed this film until the end.  Like ""The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming"", this turned out to be a political film.  But I didn't realize that until the UN speech that the space man gave at the end.  A really good film turned into a ""no, not this again"" film in the last couple of minutes.  So I rated this four stars instead of five.

Sorry, folks, I like my national sovereignty, and this film attacks it.

By the way, it did show me something we're still arguing about--how big cars should be.  Cars back then were the size of minivans now, while today's cars are smaller than they were decades ago.

441969,5,6302168465,"I was worried about the sound- old black and white movies were not known for their sound quality. But this has THX and great stereo sound, and the video was restored and cleaned up.

The extras are interesting as well, and since nearly everyone involved in this picture is now dead, the interviews are historical. The overly theatrical promotional materials are also included. Pat Neal could hardly keep a straight face when uttering the immortal words (you know, ""Klaatu! Borada. Nicto!"").

If you never experienced this version, it puts the recent remake to shame. Yes, the special effects and the Theremin could be considered cheesy, but this movie is not at all about special effects. It actually has a good plot involving interaction between characters! This version is considered by many to be the finest SF movie ever-or close to it- and it is certainly a classic, even if it is SF. The Theremin instrumentation was stolen and used by so many cheesy SF movies afterwards, but Bernard Herman, one of the best score composers ever, used it to great but not overdone effect.

Overall, this movie stands up well to any modern flick. You won't miss the lack of color.  In those days, a color movie was the exception, not the rule. The slow ASA film results in great contrast. This message that peace is needed (vs. the re-make's message about 'green') is sorrily still appropriate, even if much warfare today seems to come from terrorists and insurrectionists.",1314489600,5,1462,4.859437751004016
441970,5,6302168465,"Movies with plots associated with moral plays are many and varied, with many of these found in the Science Fiction genre. Not many have been associated with both a moral dimension and a socio/political focus. The Day the Earth Stood Still (not to be confused with the appalling recent re-make starring Keanu Reaves), came to the screen at the time of deep social concern with the progress of science and the deep seated fears of the western populace regarding the rise of communism and the propaganda surrounding the risks to civilization that a union between atomic power and the soviet state presented. The movie also appeared at a time of changing perspectives with the relevance of the church and the teachings of religion,and tapped into the unease and worries of a maturing, sophisticated society.

It attempted to provide both a calming reassurance in the oversight and power of a saviour (none too subtly linked to the lead characters (Klaatu's) assumed name (John Carpenter, i.e J.C or Jesus Christ), and a cautionary tale of the risk of unfettered scientific development to the health of the world. It also provided a early expression of an awakening concept of the world as both a living organism, and a component in a broader sentient universe. All this is a Man versus Robot genre science fiction movie. It highlighted the risk of ignorance and blinkered belief in propaganda, whilst displaying the inherent worth of the common man, and was one of the first movies that focussed on a female lead as the hero (Patricia Neal).

There are many levels and subtle sub-plots to this movie that allows it to be appreciated in addition to being a thrilling sci-fi/horror movie. The soundtrack by Bernard Hermann is itself, splendid, and provides an eerie and suspenseful backdrop. This is a movie for both lovers of the genre, and for people who like a good action story.",1314489600,,1876,4.89622641509434

441995,5,6302168465,"Few science fiction films from the 1950's stand the test of time as well as The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), a true masterwork that combines a compelling story with outstanding special effects, produce a film that delivers a message at a time when the world was just coming to terms with the scary possibility of a nuclear catastrophe.

Director Robert Wise (The Andromeda Strain, West Side Story, The Sand Pebbles, The Sound Of Music), at the early stages of an illustrious career, does a masterful job in the fledgling genre of science fiction, telling the tale of an alien named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) who lands his flying saucer in Washington DC, with the intent to deliver a message to the people of the Earth.  Surrounded by a curious crowd and the army, the saucer opens up, and a figure in a space suit walks out.  Unfortunately after pulling an object from his clothing, the visitor is shot by a nervous soldier.  A huge robot named Gort emerges from the spaceship, and firing a disintegrator ray from its head, destroys some of the weapons of the soldiers in the area, before being stopped by Klaatu.

After this quite impressive sequence, Klaatu is taken to Walter Reed Hospital for treatment, but after several conversations with the President's secretary (Frank Conroy), the alien finds that he cannot get an audience with the world's leaders.  Klaatu leaves the hospital, and calling himself Carpenter, finds his way to a rooming house in the city.

Carpenter quickly becomes friendly with fellow lodger Helen Benson (Patricia Neal), and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray).  While Helen is on a date with her boyfriend Tom Stephens (Hugh Marlowe), Carpenter tours Washington DC with the boy.  They visit the residence of Professor Jacob Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), a noted scientist, to leave a vital clue.  This leads to a meeting between Klaatu and Banhardt, where the scientist agrees to help arrange a meeting with some prominent scientists.  To establish his credibility, Klaatu arranges for a worldwide power outage that lasts for half an hour.  This incident proves convincing, and a meeting is arranged at the spaceship, however things don't go quite as planned.

One of the reasons the film is so compelling, is because instead of being a destructive monster, Klaatu is an alien is very similar to man, who comes in peace.  He interacts with people rationally and with understanding, even though he has been injured by humans.  Klaatu is highly intelligent, but still encounters many problems because his knowledge about man was mainly gained through listening to radio broadcasts.  Things like the nature of man, and the political situation on Earth are a mystery to him, and that lack of knowledge is one of the reasons he gets shot the first time.  Fortunately, Helen manages to prevent Gort from wreaking havoc when Klaatu is shot again.  The robot, who has the potential to become the stereotypical science fiction monster, instead saves the day, resurrecting the injured spaceman.  After nearly losing his life, Klaatu delivers a stern warning to the people of Earth before departing.  He might not get high marks back home for the way the mission went, but Klaatu's adventure is a very entertaining and suspenseful alien encounter, with a great performance from Michael Rennie.

For a film released in 1951, the special effects hold up surprisingly well.  The saucercraft, the spacesuited Klaatu, and the fearsome robot Gort, all became memorable icons in early sci-fi movie lore.  The two disc special edition has some solid extras including featurettes on writer Harry Bates, who wrote the short story that the film is loosely based on, and the film's screenwriter Edmund North.  There are two commentary tracks, one featuring directors Robert Wise and Nicholas Meyer (Time After Time, Star Trek II & VI) informally talking shop, is quite informative and entertaining.

This is an alien encounter that belongs in any 50's science fiction fan's collection, along with classics like Them! (1954), War Of The Worlds (1953), The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers (1956), and The Thing From Another World (1951).",1299628800,,4135,5.019033674963397

442001,5,6302168465,"I can't count the number of times I've wished this movie would come true.  Most SF films have portrayed aliens as hostile to humanity.  This one takes a different approach.  The main character, an ambassador from a planetary alliance similar to Star Trek's United Federation of Planets, arrives in Washington DC via flying saucer.  His name is Klaatu, and he has a giant metal robot named Gort that acts as his bodyguard.  He has a message that's vital to humanity's future, but before he can deliver it he's shot and wounded by a trigger happy soldier.  Gort responds by wiping out a number of tanks and other military vehicles with a ray weapon fired from his helmet, but takes no lives in the process.

Recovering at an inhumanly fast rate, Klaatu frees himself from the military hospital he's being held in and decides to go undercover and observe the human race firsthand.  Along the way he makes the acquaintance of a young widow, (played by the lovely Patricia Neal), her adolescent son and her jerk boyfriend.  Meanwhile Gort is encased in a clear metallic alloy that the Army believes will render him unable to move.

The film culminates with Klaatu delivering an ultimatum to an assembled group of world leaders, with Gort, who has proven himself to be unstoppable, at his side. Klaatu's terms: earth is invited give up its warlike ways and join the interplanetary alliance.  World peace will be assured by a police force consisting of Gort and his robot buddies, who will use advanced technology to punish any nation that invades another.  If earth spurns the invitation then it will be ""reduced to a burned out cinder"" to prevent it from spreading its violence throughout the galaxy.  Klaatu departs after delivering this message, with the question of how the world will respond left open.

The movie has a single flaw.  Its special effects are cheesy, even by 1950s standards.  In every other respect it's excellent.  The acting, storyline, scripting, etc. are superior to 95% of the films made today.  Its message is as relevant now as it was when it was made.

It was cool to see the old Capital Transit buses and streetcars, the People's Drug Store, the real phone number on the Yellow Cab rather than the usual ""555-5555"" routine we get nowadays for phone numbers (funny how everyone in movies has the same phone number now). The television camera had the call letters of a real station in Washington--WMAL, channel 7. The call letters have been changed some years ago to WJLA, but if you grew up in Washington in the 50's you would feel a connection to the old WMAL. The radio guy interviewing the folks at the mall held a WEAM microphone. That was a real radio station in the Washington area.

I don't think anybody mentioned that Billy Gray, the child actor, went on to play Bud Anderson in the Father Knows Best series.

ABOUT THE MOVIE--
Filmed entirely on the FOX backlot (except for a few 2nd unit shots of D.C.), no one at the time could have imagined that THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL would reach legendary status and remain there almost 60 years later.

The story of the arrival in the U.S. capital city of alien Klaatu and his policeman robot Gort remains relevant to this day. Klaatu's message that Earthlings are becoming a threat because of their militarism and nuclear weapons might be right out of today's news.

Klaatu comes in peace with a communique vital to our planet's survival and is immediately wounded by rifle fire for his efforts. After escaping from Walter Reed Hospital, Klaatu takes on the alias of Carpenter and becomes a boarder with Helen Benson (Neal). He instantly bonds with Helen's son, Bobby (Gray) and the two go on a D.C. sightseeing tour that ends at the home of Prof. Barnhardt (Jaffe). ""Carpenter"" solves a complex mathematical equation on the not-home professor's chalkboard, and leaves a note with his name and address.

Later, Carpenter/Klaatu enlists Barnhardt's aid in telling all the nations of Earth that the planet will be destroyed if a way ian't found for everyone to live in peace. He also reveals his true identity to Helen; her boyfriend, Tom (Marlowe) betrays Helen's confidence and informs the authorities of Klaatu's whereabouts, but if he's killed, robot Gort is programmed to destroy the Earth.

I will say I love both movies, but TDTESS will always be my favorite sci-fi film. This from a person who owns all the modern sci-fi films and TV series. It was such a pleasure to watch this without commercials. The blu-ray presentation is very impressive, very little grain and just awesome audio. It loaded on my blu-ray in less than 30 seconds.

Remembering the first time I watched this movie, my age was about 10 years and it was on the NBC Saturday Night at the Movies. It was usually on every two years or so. Really doubt if I blinked during the entire film the first time I watched it. Didn't want to miss a millisecond of the story. Really do doubt if there will ever be a more pure example of basic sci-fi than this film.",1274572800,7,904,4.280701754385965

I have wanted a copy of my own for some time. To me it is one of the classic Sic-Fi flicks of all time.  The remake did not do the original justice.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-the-Earth-Stood-Still/dp/B00005JKFR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>

442085,5,6302168465,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is one hour and thirty-two minutes and was released in theaters on September 28, 1951. The movie plays like an antiwar movie. The basic storyline is that a spaceship from two-hundred and fifty miles away lands in President's Park, in Washington, D.C. and a human like alien and giant robot appears. Klaatu, the alien appears and while reaching for a gift for the president, he is shot by soldier. Klaatu is taken to a hospital and later escapes from it. Klaatu moves into a border house so he can study the people of Earth. At the house he befriends a young boy named Bobby. Bobby gives Mr. Carpenter, Klaatu, a tour of Washington, D.C. One of the stops is at Arlington National Cemetery where Mr. Carpenter is distraught to learn that the people in the graves died mostly from past wars. The two pay a visit to the home of Professor Jacob Barnhardt and Mr. Carpenter goes over Professor Barnhardt math\physics formula and makes a correction. Before the two leave Mr. Carpenter leave his address with the housekeeper so Professor Barnhardt can call on him. A federal agent comes to the boarding house and collects Mr. Carpenter to take him to Professor Barnhardt's home. Mr. Carpenter reveals to Professor Barnhardt that he is Klaatu. Klaatu asks Professor Barnhardt to gather a group of international scientists at his spaceship so he can give them a message to take back to their governments. Professor Barnhardt asks Klaatu to give a demonstration of his technology but to harm no one in the process. Klaatu manages to sneak back on his ship set up the demonstration. The next day all the electricity across the world shuts down for a half hour with the exception of hospitals and planes in flight. The United States government and army go on a manhunt for Klaatu. Klaatu is shot in the back while trying to make it back to his spaceship. Before he is shot he tells Helen these famous words: ""Klaatu barada nikto"". Helen must say these words to Gort, the alien giant robot, or Gort might just scorch Earth. Gort retrieves Klaatu and takes him back to the spaceship where he is bought back to life. Klaatu leaves a message to the people of saying if you bring your warlike ways to our galaxy, we will scorch your Earth and all life on it will be killed or you can choose peace. The choice is yours and we will be waiting for your answer. If look in the beginning of movie you will notice Frances Bavier in her movie debut. Frances Bavier is better known as Aunt Bee in the Andy Griffith Show. Also this was Michael Rennie (Klaatu\Mr. Carpenter) first leading role and top billing role as well. The Day the Earth Stood Still gets an AAAAA+++++.

442091,5,6302168465,"Robert Wise has got to be the most successful underappreciated directors in movie history.  His resume includes: WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, THE SAND PEBBLES, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE and, from the early 1950's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  Now I have seen the remake.  Save your time and money.  As is all too often the case Hollywood tried to update something and came up with an albsolute turd.  Some things can't be remade because they are shaped by the time in which the original was made.  Such is the case of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  Roughly based on Jerome Bates' story ""Farewell to the Master"", the Earth is stirred by the arrival of Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and his giant robot Gort (Lock Martin).  Firmly fixed in the hysteria and fixation on nuclear war, TDESS is a cautionary tale about how would other species beyond the earth look at a hostile, violent human race bringing such baggage with them into the cosmos.  Terrific performances by Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe as a scientist meant to represent Albert Einstein and Billy Gray.  Incredible score by Bernard Hermann.  Extras includes a long documentary about the making of this sci-fi classic.  Thank God this was done at a time when Wise was still around.",1261267200,4,1279,4.737556561085973
442092,5,6302168465,"I only recently started posting reviews on Amazon which is why this one is so late...

When I first saw the trailer for the recent remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, I knew vaguely about the plot.  I generally make every effort to see the original or read the book before I see a remake or adaptation.  So, before the remake came out I sat down at my PC and pulled up Netflix.  I was truly blown away by this movie.  The acting is superb, the story is amazing and the pacing perfectly builds tension.  I never thought a movie from the 1950's would have me on the edge of my seat but this one did.

By todays standards yes the special effects are of course extremely dated, but for that time they were absolutely cutting edge and really considering when this was made they are actually quite well done.  No strings on the spaceships no obvious use of miniatures.  They used forced perspective to make Gort look 12 ft tall.  Really ahead of their time.

My main point is everything in this movie is done well, and I can see why this is considered a masterpiece of Science Fiction.

The 2008 remake?  not so much.",1261008000,3,1116,4.3076923076923075
442113,5,6302168465,"The Shakespearean actor Michael Rennie lamented that he would be forever remembered for a few words of gobbledygook (""Gort---Barenga!"") instead of ""What a piece of work is man!"" but the beautiful thing about this ageless 1951 classic is that it IS Hamlet's Soliliquy. Rennie plays Klaatu, an interstellar ambassador who lands in Washington DC to bring peace to the planet Earth. Unfortunately, he's immediately shot by a soldier with an itchy trigger finger. After recovering, he decides to go incognito to observe human society.

He quickly makes the acquaintance of Patricia Neal, a single mother boarding in his rooming house. She begins to think there's something unusual about ""Mr. Carpenter,"" but Klaatu is never frightening. Quite to the contrary. He is a soft-spoken, pacific, and gentlemanly sort who, though occasionally dismayed by human nature, recognizes it for what it is---evolving.

Even after being shot, killed, and regenerated by his android assistant Gort (played in a rubber suit by the very tall doorman of Grauman's Chinese Theatre), Klaatu asks for nothing more than an opportunity to address Earth's combined leadership. The scientific community applauds his request, but the military-industrial complex shudders. Things reach a climax when Klaatu uses the immense power of his culture to de-energize all Earth machines for one hour. The Earth stands still. Faced with such awesome power, humanity listens to this quiet, articulate, reasonable space visitor.

This is a thoughtful and intelligent film, short on effects but long on story, a tale of hope and of the ultimate redemption of the human spirit. It's antiwar message strikes just the right balance. The choice is ours.

Given it's era, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL could have degenerated into a paranoid red-baiting fantasy, but it doesn't. The anxiety of the time is present and destructive, but is rendered understandable. The threat of nuclear annihilation is very real, and is the one thing really to be feared. At this time, the U.S. was destroying atolls in nuclear tests, Russia had just developed the bomb, and the hydrogen bomb was in final development.

The early Cold War has given us a parable of tolerance, a critique of xenophobia, one that addresses what's best in human nature while never ignoring what is worst.",1259625600,5,2314,5.209677419354839
442114,5,6302168465,"If there is any message I can find in the original version of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" it is that of accepting the unknown as a source of wisdom rather than fearing it as an antagonist. We cannot survive on this planet if we are always going to insist that everything becomes the way that we want it to be. We must meet the Infinite on its own terms or become superfluous.

This 2-disc DVD set is the only one you want.  It contains not only the flawlessly restored original b&w movie from the early 50s, but HOURS of related video commentary and press releases.  Other remarkable material includes behind-the-scene shots, the saucer blueprints, how GORT was made, promo art, a video of a thereminist playing the eerie prelude to TDTEST, and a reading of the original short story, ""Farewell to the Master"", by it's late author Harry Bates.

442120,5,6302168465,"After renting a long line of sci fi B movies from the 50s for fun, we rented this one to remember what real movie making was like. The acting in this movie is top notch, with Patricia Neal turning in a solid performance, with depth of character and thoughtful touches. The alien visitor, who could so easily have some across as smarmy and superior, is carried off with gravity and humor. Even the annoying boyfriend, who could have been a cardboard cutout of a character, is well-acted. All the lines are delivered convincingly, with the kind of tone and pauses that makes characters come to life. It's *fun* watching it all done well.

The special effects are good for a 1951 movie, but they aren't the main part of the story and are used sparingly. The story is a classic, and like all good sci fi, it's more about what we are like as humans than anything else. The movie drips an acid commentary on mil-think, media bias, and small minded hysteria, making it still relevant today.

Highly recommended for anyone that wants to see solid science fiction - well written, well acted, well filmed, and well edited.

442121,2,6302168465,"This is a science fiction film that is moderately good at times.

It was made in the early 1950s so the technology, special effects, etc. are minimal.  That is understandable.

The story itself is more problematic.  It is basically propaganda camouflaged as entertainment.  The gist of the story is about an alien from another planet, Klaatu (Michael Rennie) who comes to Earth along with his robot Gort (Lock Martin) to threatent Earthlings with their extinction if they continue along their 'warlike path'.  There is a scene with Klaatu that is an allegory of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  That is rather tasteless especially considering that the message delivered is one of death threats in complete contrast to the message of love and life given by Jesus.  The basic message of the interplanetary traveler is: 'be peaceful or we'll kill you'.

If not for the questionable messages given, this might be considered a pretty good movie from that period of time.  As it is, I do not recommend it.",1246665600,5,1001,4.904761904761905

442164,4,6302168465,"This Blu-Ray was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player.

I am 33 years old and have a general idea of the political climate, during the time this film was released. I've also grown up in a film climate that is pre-occupied with special effects, generated by computers, and a break-neck pace. But this film's slower pace and emphasis on the dialogue worked for me.

The most striking aspect of this film, was that it is still relevant in its message and themes, for today. The warnings of the perils of aggression worldwide, could not be more important, than today, given the terrorist & nuclear threats. In addition, the repeated emphasis on the need for world leaders to unite and the message to be given to them, all at once, instead of in isolation, speaks volumes of the general need for a unified and concerted worldwide effort for less aggression and war-all of these things were interlaced in the dialogue, without an overkill of ""preaching"".

The PQ was a 3/5/5, with noticable artifacts and grain. I am not sure if anything was done to the original print, as I've not seen it. Since it was in black and white, there is nothing to say regarding color. However, overall the film was fairly clear and sharp, given its age. Sound quality was a 4/5, and the music in the film is representative of the power of sound in older films in conveying drama, fear, and other emotions.

Though the effects in the film can of course not be compared to today's pomp and circumstance, the film stands solid on its political message for mankind. The visual look of the film is still iconic,and it's clear why the film took its place in sci-fi history as a multi-faceted precursor to modern sci-fi.

442169,4,6302168465,"Saw this for the first time a little while ago, and I was fairly impressed. Very basic premise, a UFO with a man and his robot lands in DC with a warning to all mankind, but as flawed as humanity is, they shoot first and ask questions later and all hell breaks loose from there. Its story is simplistic and so is the morality of the film, which is beware of the dangers associated with nuclear weapons and do not give up on peaceful solutions to problems, despite the odds stacked against them.

The film was made back in 1951, so considering its time frame, the visual and special effects were excellent. I really liked the UFO design from the sleek and functional exterior to the dazzling and stylish user interface within the craft. One of the best parts about the whole film was that it serves as a time capsule by capturing the mood of the era, the feelings and fears of American society during post WW2 and the early cold war period, not to mention a sense of innocence that is unheard of today in this cynical and morally corrupt culture. It truly was the golden years.

Overall the acting was great, not only by Klaatu aka Mr. Carpenter, the intergalactic traveler, but also by the mother and her son Bobby with whom Klaatu stayed during his short stop on earth. His robot Gort didn't say anything, but his presence was riveting and his actions spoke louder than words, definitely very intimidating despite his apparent subtle presence. Klaatu's presence was understated yet effective, coming across as a man in control of his destiny, wise beyond mankind's limited capacity of understanding and intelligent way above the most brilliant professor. Not only that but he was suave and debonair, quite charismatic and his presence was felt by all, audience included, there was no mistaking that he was a man to be reckoned with.

I will not spoil the ending, but it had a profound message that is timeless and as relevant to today's world as it was back then, if only people could understand and learn from it. That is a sign of a classic movie which approaches its subject with a practicality and simple yet profound wisdom that transcends space and time. Today's Hollywood could benefit from its modus operandi and get back to basics. Film making is an art form in all its aspects, and shouldn't be limited to being a visual tour de force. This film is a prime example of that.",1243036800,,2384,4.604705882352941

442201,5,6302168465,"I got this DVD a week before I went away to West Virgina for a family reunion. Something I noticed was when Gort goes haywire with his laser when Klaatu gets shot (while trying to present a gift for the president which they thought was a weapon) Klaatu says ""Gort, Deplado Prosko"" which means ""shut down"". Of course, this is where the famous line ""Klaatu, Barada, Nikto"" originated. I like Gort between him and Klaatu. I am doing a movie marathon tommorow with this movie and the 2008 remake.",1239840000,2,492,4.53932584269663
442202,5,6302168465,"My rating:  4.5 out  of 5

Premise
*A UFO lands in Washington DC, and an alien named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) steps out with a message of peace.  He is promptly shot by the military, but is given medical care.  The alien escapes the hospital and goes on his own to observe humans from the street level.  Everybody becomes paranoid, fearful, and even apprehensive about the alien running loose on the streets, leaving Klaatu to believe that humans are a premature race.

The Good Things
*Video/sound quality are essentially as perfect as they can get.
*Includes commentaries, an isolated music score, a bunch of featurettes, a ""build your own score"" feature, some games, a trailer, and some archival news reel footage.
*The movie is well-paced and has some excellent photography.
*Production design is slick.  It is a bit antequated by today's standards (Klaatu's space suit, Gort, and the space ship all look fake these days).  But the special effects are awesome; they still hold up to this day.
*The story is good.
*The characters are good; the writing and acting are good.
*Strong themes about peace and human nature.  Also a couple of strong allegories (the Cold War being a prominent aspect).
*Interesting music.

The Bad Things
*Can be a bit dull for those looking for more intense action or adventure.

This movie is a classic in all respects, and I think all the stuff above says it all.  The disc is excellent; even if you bought the ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" 2008 version and got this movie with it, this version has all the extras, so it is a worthwhile purchase.

442203,3,6302168465,"I must say I was somewhat disappointed in this version of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. The 1951 classic has an amazing story and had fantastic actors supporting the story. This version on the other hand, uses actors that aren't all that believable, or likable for that matter. Keanu Reeves was totally void of emotion, whereas Michael Rennie in the original version had such an amazing screen presence. They could have done a whole lot more with this film, it left me feeling cheated. Cant wait to pop in the original that came with this 3 disc set.

But, as with any great story, you can listen or watch the same story over and over again and enjoy it every time.  I appreciate this movie more and more every time I see it.  However, the new element of the Blu-Ray high definition transfer has taken this great story to a new level of enjoyment.  The detail in this film is amazing.  From the herringbone patterns in the suits to the cigarette smoke wafting through many scenes (seems everybody smoked in 1951) to the details of Gort's ""skin"" to the painfully obvious wires holding up Patricia Neal as she is carried by Lock Martin to the spaceship!

I thought the new version of this movie was for a remake not too bad of a movie but this version, the original, is a great achievement in storytelling.  The acting is also is of the highest caliber with Patricia Neal and Michael Rennie giving award caliber performances. Of course back then the snobs could not see beyond the sci fi label to give them a nomination but they deserved. This blu ray version is well worth owning although the standard version looks very good this is just sharper in picture. This flick surely belongs in the top 250 movies of all time so it's great that they did a blu ray edition.

Watched the remake and then purchased the original movie on DVD. They are different - the remake is weak on many issues that made the 1950 b-movie great.

This film, however, isn't one of them.  The Day the Earth Stood Still might have been though provoking in its time, but it remains a movie relevant to its time with more of a historical interest than a timeless classic.  Not to mention the wooden acting and the dated effects.  At least a tenth of the film could have been edited out without changing the story or the message.

442235,5,6302168465,"Inspired by the short story ""Farewell to the Master"" by Harry Bates, screenwriter Edmund H. North penned a timeless gaze into the the raw - and manipulated - emotions that yield distrust, hate and war on a global scale.

Director Robert Wise stresses dialogue in this Sci-Fi classic that was released in 1951 which centers on the pilot of a flying saucer - Klaatu (Michael Rennie) - and its robot guard - Gort (Lock Martin) - and a message for a world in conflict. Though the backdrop is the real Cold War and Atomic Age, the terror is through ignorance, rather than heroism through defeating an ""enemy.""

Klaatu - after landing in Washington, D.C. - views society through a variety of individuals; Major White (Robert Osterloh), Helen and Bobby Benson (Patricia Neal, Billy Gray), Tom Stevens (Hugh Marlowe), Prof. Jacob Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), who each bring a different dynamic into play. But a chill is in the air as hearts harden and minds close to an everlasting peace to reign supreme.

In the end it's might that makes right and Klaatu issues a stark warning on the consequences of bringing the senseless conflicts to the universe, ""The decision rests with you."" And it still does, after all these years.",1233878400,3,1211,4.784688995215311

Others, on Amazon, have done a far more insightful, and eloquent job of reviewing than I ever could. I will just say this is an excellent production of a wonderful movie. If anything, Klaatu (and the other characters) and the questions he asks, made me think deeply about my humanity.

I have one, lingering question though...just after the scene where the space ship lands, a middle aged, balding man is seen running through the streets shouting ""It's landed on the mall.""

Is that man Fredric March? If it is not he, it is his clone.",1233792000,,614,4.473214285714286

The acting can be a bit cheesy at times but hey at least you can have a good laugh at that. The story is what is so good about this movie and, sadly, is what the remake completely failed to recreate.

The only thing I felt was unnecessary was the inclusion of the trailer for the '08 (and only adequate) version of the film. (If they had put it at the end of the film, I would have no objections, nor will I probably ever take a look at this '08 film. I have too much respect for the '51 film to see the other version.)

The extras are well done, with a couple of interviews with surviving cast members, an audio reading of the Harry Bates short story that inspired the film, and a couple of ""how we did it"" short flms.

The premise is simple and yet profound. An alien visitor that looks human arrives on Earth to give Earth's people a message about the future of mankind; however political red-tape and our own personal problems prevent him from delivering the message because he needs to assemble World leaders for it to happen and they just can't because of divisions. So instead he shows a sign by making all machinery stop around the world for a limited amount of time and in doing so this causes the military to kill him. It's an essential piece for any movie collection and the moral to the message doesn't change and still matters today. There are also a lot of religious undercurrent themes (such as bodily resurrection, miracles and signs) but in the context of a highly developed race with advanced technology that should amuse the scientifically-minded.",1231200000,,1012,4.788571428571428

The basic storyline is that a spaceship from two-hundred and fifty miles away lands in President's Park, in Washington, D.C. and a human like alien and giant robot appears. Klaatu, the alien appears and while reaching for a gift for the president, he is shot by soldier. Klaatu is taken to a hospital and later escapes from it. Klaatu moves into a border house so he can study the people of Earth. At the house he befriends a young boy named Bobby. Bobby gives Mr. Carpenter, Klaatu, a tour of Washington, D.C. One of the stops is at Arlington National Cemetery where Mr. Carpenter is distraught to learn that the people in the graves died mostly from past wars. The two pay a visit to the home of Professor Jacob Barnhardt and Mr. Carpenter goes over Professor Barnhardt math\physics formula and makes a correction. Before the two leave Mr. Carpenter leave his address with the housekeeper so Professor Barnhardt can call on him. A federal agent comes to the boarding house and collects Mr. Carpenter to take him to Professor Barnhardt's home. Mr. Carpenter reveals to Professor Barnhardt that he is Klaatu. Klaatu asks Professor Barnhardt to gather a group of international scientists at his spaceship so he can give them a message to take back to their governments. Professor Barnhardt asks Klaatu to give a demonstration of his technology but to harm no one in the process. Klaatu manages to sneak back on his ship set up the demonstration. The next day all the electricity across the world shuts down for a half hour with the exception of hospitals and planes in flight. The United States government and army go on a manhunt for Klaatu. Klaatu is shot in the back while trying to make it back to his spaceship. Before he is shot he tells Helen these famous words: ""Klaatu barada nikto"". Helen must say these words to Gort, the alien giant robot, or Gort might just scorch Earth. Gort retrieves Klaatu and takes him back to the spaceship where he is bought back to life. Klaatu leaves a message to the people of saying if you bring your warlike ways to our galaxy, we will scorch your Earth and all life on it will be killed or you can choose peace. The choice is yours and we will be waiting for your answer. If look in the beginning of movie you will notice Frances Bavier in her movie debut. Frances Bavier is better known as Aunt Bee in the Andy Griffith Show. Also this was Michael Rennie (Klaatu\Mr. Carpenter) first leading role and top billing role as well.

442337,5,6302168465,"Though released almost sixty years ago in 1951, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is a sci-fi and cinema classic that still holds up incredibly well. The film has had a huge impact upon popular culture and many elements in the film, e.g. the groundbreaking score, are now staples of the sci-fi genre.

The movie opens with worldwide warnings of an object hurling towards Earth. The object turns out to be a spaceship that lands in a field in Washington, D.C. The military, police officers, emergency personnel, and casual spectators surround the ship to see what will happen. A door opens in the spacecraft and a human-like creature walks out. The creature claims to come in peace and begins to take out a device from his suit. A fearful soldier shoots the creature and he falls to the ground wounded. From the spaceship a giant robot, named Gort, emerges and proceeds to destroy all the weapons in the area. He stops at the alien's command. The robot freezes and no one is able to move him from his place. Meanwhile, the alien is taken to a hospital. It is learned that the alien's name is Klaatu and he has come to Earth to deliver a vital message to the leaders of the world. Unfortunately, the world is an imperfect place and many of the world's leaders refuse to come to Washington, D.C. to hear what Klaatu has to say. So, he takes things into his own hands and escapes from the hospital. Very few people know what Klaatu looks like and he is able to blend in with the populace. He takes up residence at a local boarding house and takes the name of Mr. Carpenter. Klaatu attempts to complete his mission, but also befriends Helen Benson (Patricia Neal), a widowed mother, and her son, Bobby (Billy Gray).

Though some modern viewers might find THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL quaint, the film was exceptionally well done. The movie is notable for it's memorable images, e.g. Gort chasing after Helen Benson, and groundbreaking score by Bernard Herrman (the movie was one of the first to use theremins, an instrument that soon became common place in sci-fi musical scores). The movie withstood the test of time to become a classic piece of filmmaking and science fiction, it still holds up incredibly well today. Not only that, but despite not having many of the particulars that audiences seem to clamor for today: tons of special effects, excessive violence, gratuitous sexuality, etc.; the movie can still captivate an audience. In short, it's a film that people of all ages and from all walks of life can watch and enjoy today. ""Klaatu barada nikto."" And for those of you with a keen eye, look for Frances Bavier (best known as Aunt Bea on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW) as Mrs. Barley, one of the residents of the boarder house that Klaatu moves into.

The DVD includes all kinds of extra features including a commentary by Robert Wise, a 70-minute documentary entitled ""Making the Earth Stand Still"", a Movietone Newsreel that includes a spot with Gort, restoration comparatives between the original film and restored versions of the movie, still galleries, the shooting script, original theatrical trailer, and trailers for ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. and JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH. I particularly enjoyed the ""Making the Earth Stand Still"" documentary. I learned a great deal about the movie that I had never known or thought about before. For instance, though the parallels are rather apparent, I had never picked up on the Christian allegorical elements of the film. I also found it fascinating that Lock Martin, the giant of a man who portrayed Gort, was rather feeble.",1230595200,,3576,4.745980707395498
442388,5,6302168465,"This classic science fiction, the defining film of the genre for many people, is about a humanoid that travels 250,000,000 miles from another planet with a message for the people of our planet. He lands in Washington, D.C. with his guardian robot and attempts to connect with world leaders to make his message known. There is mistrust by those in power of someone they are unfamiliar with and powers they have not seen before. They are not willing to give him the opportunity to speak so he must attempt to get his message out through other channels. Are there people who will listen to his message of how to prevent Planet Earth from self destructing or being destroyed from outside forces? Will anyone take him seriously? You have to remember that this was made during the height of the Cold War and nuclear war was on the radar screen of almost every citizen. Watch the newsreel that coincides with the release of the movie to see what was going on in the world at that time and it will help to put the movie into context. While there is action and some violence this is also a movie of relationships and how people react to something/someone they're not familiar with. A classic still worth watching today with good entertainment value as well as plenty of food for thought. [...]",1230422400,,1284,4.611353711790393

442390,5,6302168465,"I was nine years old when this film first came out -- about the age of Patricia Neal's little boy. My parents refused to let me see it, so I had to pretend I was attending another film. I identified heavily with the little boy, of course, and for weeks after fantasized about having an alien friend with unearthly powers. Aside from some very bad TV series, it was my first real experience with science fiction. Some time later, in a literary theory class, I wrote an essay about the film's brilliant use of media as a disseminator of disinformation and hysteria. Recently I taught The Day the Earth Stood Still in a Science Fiction Film course at my University and was surprised at how well it went over with the young people, who typically reject anything prior to their generation. To me it's one of the greatest science fiction classics of all time, but it had a lot going against it: black and white movie, few special effects, fairly obscure actors, obtrusive film score, etc. But the students picked up on the film's virtues: the argument for peace in a world threatened with annihilation, a simple but effective script, beautiful black and white cinematography, the ancient drama of betrayal and redemption, a spooky mystery story, quality acting, and iconic scenes, such as Gort, the giant robot, standing immobile before the ship in the DC Mall. In their final essays, the students praised and wrote about this film more than any other in the course, including more recent favorites, such as Star Wars and The Matrix.",1230249600,,1527,4.7443609022556394

442396,5,6302168465,"Having reviewed this latest release of the 1951 movie - and within 14 hours having seen the recent remake - the contrast is amazing.  The black and white original version is the winner!  The most recent package is coherent, well-defined, and the audio is crystal clear.  The extras are appropriate and timely.

The movie and the message of the original have not stood still.  The acting is superb and the limited visual effects of the time are very well done.  With the ""Gort diaper"" and the ""Gort head-bob"" being the only real sticking points, this is the best version - hands down.  In terms of the well-tailored screenplay and the superior film scoring by the master - Bernard Herrmann - fifty-seven years could hardly improve upon it.

It's not appropriate to discuss the new movie in this format, but - in all fairness - the casting is superb, the CGI is as good as CGI can get (it's still obviously computer-generated)and the score is - well, it's there somewhere, but, let's face it - trying to score a remake of this classic took a lot of guts! !!!!!!!MOVIE SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! Gort's diaper problem and teeter-totter head are solved in the 2008 version.  Thankfully, the new version never quite went where I thought they were headed as to why we were going to be destroyed (they came close to dropping the global warming bomb).

So,take a look at the old movie and then see what a difference more than half a century makes in both the movie and the methods.  This remains a top ten sci-fi classic - you won't be disappointed.

442397,5,6302168465,"It's a very telling point, that the weakest feature of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still (Two-Disc Special Edition)"" is the preview of the 2008 remake of this classic. Seeing characterization supplanted by stereotype, mood replaced by special effects, and universal kindness, by cold aloofness, one can appreciate, even more, what a very special film the 1951 original was!

Created in an era of increasing paranoia, as the Cold War began, our failures in Korea created a sense of helplessness, and a nearly irrational fear of Communist world domination led to witch hunts in every field of endeavor, this simple tale of the galactic community sending an envoy to warn Earth to keep their problems 'at home', or face annihilation, offered a quiet note of reason for an insane time.

Intentionally filled with metaphors (many of them, Christian in nature), the black and white film, directed by the legendary Robert Wise, has a Noirish, documentary 'feel', heightened by actual newspersons in cameo roles, describing the action. Despite the threat of giant enforcement robot, Gort, the actual emissary, Klaatu (brilliantly portrayed by Michael Rennie), is kind, and curious about our planet, and the film becomes a well-crafted character study, as he bonds with a widowed secretary (Patricia Neal), her son (Billy Gray), and Earth's greatest scientist (soon to be blacklisted Sam Jaffe). The real villain of the film is man's paranoia over anything they don't understand, and, sadly, despite a decisive display of alien technological superiority, the film offers only a small hope that we might come to our senses (which makes the film timeless, as we still haven't achieved the maturity the alien community demanded of us, over a half-century ago).

The new two-disc collection offers a wealth of special features, from the creation of the film (did you know that Claude Rains and Spencer Tracy were the first choices to play Klaatu?), a look at the remarkable electronic-based theremin, which created the unearthly musical effects, and brief histories of the era, personalities, and UFO sightings rampant in the late 1940s. Added treats include a dramatic reading of Harry Bates' story, ""Farewell to the Master"", which was the basis of the film (and far more chilling!), and an 'audio only' option, allowing viewers to savor both the theremins (two were used in the film), and Bernard Herrman's brilliant score.

442442,3,6302168465,"First and foremost, this is a review for the 1951, black and white, 1.33:1 aspect ratio, 2-disc, special edition DVD and NOT for the remake (Gort! Keanu barada nikto :)

Okay so here's the lowdown; as I now have both this new edition and the original single, flipper disc, version, and having watched all of the bonus features on the new 2-disc set, I can tell you this: keep the old disc!

Why, because the 73 plus minute, making of, on the original disc is gone, replaced with a new 23 minute fluff piece that only skims the surface of the story, of the making of this film.

Gone are the lengthy on camera interviews with the producer, director and female lead, replaced instead with film historian's inane babble, with the odd snippet of voice recordings of the director and producer, taken from the 73 plus minutes, making of, from the original disc (without the on camera picture).

Also gone, is the very interesting, ""Collectors"", segment, tacked onto the end of the original making of, which had several prominent collectors showing off such treasures as the original flying saucer model and Gort statue, used in the actual film, with anecdotes about the film, and where the props they now owned, had ended up after the filming.

As for the extra stuff added to the 2-disc set, nothing is worth the non-inclusion of the original making of from the first disc (most of the new stuff has nothing to do with the film, but instead conveys the political tensions of the world at that time, which, although slightly of interest, is not worth upgrading for).

And on a new extra note for the new 2-disc set, the reading of, Farewell To The Master, is poorly executed, with a static picture with simple playing instructions, present throughout the entire reading (where as they could of has stills from the film playing throughout the reading, while the soundtrack played quietly in the background) and trying to maneuver through the reading is a nightmare, as there are three chapter stops, which are about 10 plus minutes each, with no way of fast searching through the 10 plus minute segments, so if you stop playing the reading at 9 minutes, you can't start the playback where you left off but instead have to listen to the whole thing from the start of the chapter (I know this because I stopped the playback for a minute, and when I hit the play button on the remote, the film started to play, so I had to go back to the menu and start the reading again, and listen to the stuff I had already heard. I would have preferred that an onscreen text version of the short (45 pages - not so short in my books) story be included instead).

So unless you are a completes, then this 2-disc version isn't worth the money, and even if you are looking to buy this for the first time, I'd HIGHLY recommend that you pick up the original DVD release, as the picture quality is the same, and you get the far superior 73 plus minute, making of, along with the director's commentary, picture galleries and original trailer.",1228435200,333,3012,4.5769944341372915

442505,4,6302168465,"The other day I bought the DVD of one of my favorite all-time films: The Day The Earth Stood Still. In watching it I was struck by how relevant this sci fi classic from over 50 years ago is to today's political milieu. In brief, a flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C. Its occupant is a creature that looks human enough, named Klaatu (Michael Rennie). He is injured by fearful humans as the military surrounds the spacecraft. He is rescued by an all-powerful robot named Gort, who vaporizes the military machinery.
  Klaatu decides to infiltrate human society under the pseudonym Carpenter and takes up residence at a local boarding house, where he meets a widow named Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) who has a 10 year old son Bobby (Billy Gray of later Father Knows Best fame). In short, Klaatu is hunted down and killed by the military, then resurrected by Gort, who is aided by Helen, who knows the phrase that can control Gort: Klaatu Barada Nikto. Upon leaving Earth Klaatu issues an edict: either humans can change their ways or they will be exterminated if they spread their nuclear terror to the stars. Klaatu has only been an emissary from an organization called the United Planets. Gort is merely one of many all-powerful robots that police the UP registry and battle warring instinct with extermination- a policy all UP members submit to. With this knowledge Klaatu and Gort leave Earth to ponder its fate.
  Of course, the film has provoked many philosophical, ethical, and political salvos through the years. Made during the early years of the Cold War its symbolism was obvious, and its `message' later became standard fare for much of the early `real' UFO lore, depicted by the `Contactees' of that era. But, its message still resonates today, in the post-Cold War restiveness of dying religious Fundamentalism's death throes. Especially since Rennie plays a near-Christ-like character.
  It has also been vociferously attacked as `liberal' propaganda. Many Leftists of the day saw the film as a plea against the insanity of the nuclear arms race, which was insane- not because of the arms race mentality, but because total annihilation could occur by error, and not intent. Rightists pointed out that the `peace' offered by Klaatu, Gort, and the UP comes only if humanity is either content to remain earthbound, or submit to the tyranny of the Gortian robocops. Counterarguments span range from the social compact gambit- i.e.- that while Earth is our home and we can do what we like the universal society at large has every right to set up its own laws and penalties. After all, we are free to parade around naked in our own homes, but not in public- to the sanity defense- that any society advanced enough to discover interstellar travel will likely create weaponry capable of planet destruction, therefore only a preemptive ban and enforcement can work.
  Yet, there does seem something amiss with Klaatu's UP. Klaatu shows he has the power to utterly immobilize human machinery (hence the film's title) yet it is oblivion or else- no degrees of shading, such as `we'll take away all your nuclear toys if you humans are bad'. It's Armageddon or compliance. The UP has no problems with hypocrisy or `benevolent' dictatorship. If we are too violent, by UP standards, they will counter with the ultimate violence. This is their law, and will be applied without any research into why humans fight: exploitation, racism, sociology, and ideological differences as reasons are all equally wrong, even if in self defense. The query rises- is peace without freedom a virtue?
  It has been counter-argued that there is such a thing as limited freedom- we do not have the right to infringe upon others' rights with our own. Klaatu claims the only freedom the UP has given up is the freedom of violence. Violence is the only freedom that is policed by Gort and his robotic brethren. The film has thus been seen as posing the question How would society function if disputes had to be resolved without violence? And it's a good query.",1222300800,,4038,4.873177842565598
442506,5,6302168465,"Filmed entirely on the FOX backlot (except for a few 2nd unit shots of D.C.), no one at the time could have imagined that THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL would reach legendary status and remain there almost 60 years later.

The story of the arrival in the U.S. capital city of alien Klaatu and his policeman robot Gort remains relevant to this day. Klaatu's message that Earthlings are becoming a threat because of their militarism and nuclear weapons might be right out of today's news.

Klaatu comes in peace with a communique vital to our planet's survival and is immediately wounded by rifle fire for his efforts. After escaping from Walter Reed Hospital, Klaatu takes on the alias of Carpenter and becomes a boarder with Helen Benson (Neal). He instantly bonds with Helen's son, Bobby (Gray) and the two go on a D.C. sightseeing tour that ends at the home of Prof. Barnhardt (Jaffe). ""Carpenter"" solves a complex mathematical equation on the not-home professor's chalkboard, and leaves a note with his name and address.

Later, Carpenter/Klaatu enlists Barnhardt's aid in telling all the nations of Earth that the planet will be destroyed if a way ian't found for everyone to live in peace. He also reveals his true identity to Helen; her boyfriend, Tom (Marlowe) betrays Helen's confidence and informs the authorities of Klaatu's whereabouts, but if he's killed, robot Gort is programmed to destroy the Earth.

Another recommended 1950s sci-fier is INVADERS FROM MARS, where intelligent life from the red planet have a plan to turn everyone on Earth into willing slaves.

TRIVIA:

Bernard Herrmann's eerie Theremin-laced score was recycled for the pilot episode of TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LOST-IN-SPACE/dp/B0000DC3VM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LOST IN SPACE</a>.

Because of the then rampant Congressional Communist witchhunts, this was Sam Jaffe's last movie appearance for almost a decade.

Billy Gray (Bobby) portrayed Bud on the sitcom&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FATHER-KNOWS-BEST/dp/B0012Q3SZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FATHER KNOWS BEST</a>.

Klaatu was originally slated to be played by Claude Rains.

Jack Palance was suggested to inhabit Gort's robot suit. A more frail man (Martin) was chosen instead.

442550,5,6302168465,"It's amazing how timely the message of this movie still is. As I watched it, I realized how much it is not science fiction at all. Its observations and conclusions about humanity are still very relevant, and I found myself thinking about them even more as we live in these troubled times. The characters are very relatable, and the bad guys are not who you would think they'd be.

I heartily recommend this movie for the following:

--Great acting--Michael Rennie's Klaatu may be human-looking, but he's anything but human
--Wonderful special effects, considering the year it was made--even my teenagers were impressed, and they usually abhor black and white films
--Christian overtones
--Inherent messages (see above)
--Plus, it's interesting from a period film viewpoint.

Although the movie deviates from the original story on which it was based (""Farewell to the Master,"" by Harry Bates), it retains the suspense, human terror, and technological/ethical questioning of the original tale.

It would be interesting to see this movie re-made with an environmental twist, with Klaatu landing and then saying, ""If you don't take care of the Earth, it's going to be taken away from you.""

Watch this movie; it will make you think.",1217376000,4,1228,5.12
442551,5,6302168465,"I agree with almost all Amazon reviewers about this film. It was a great old movie that earns five stars in my book. I am sorry that I never got to see this film on the big screen, but the restored and enhanced DVD transfer was so good that it held up well on my large screen HDTV.  Excellent documentaries were included with the DVD about the making of the film and the materials that film collectors have accumulated over the years from this great movie.

During her interview Patricia Neal commented that her biggest problem during filming was keeping a straight face when required to say her now fameous line: ""Gort, Klaatu barada nikto"".  You would never have known this from the final cut.

I only have a couple of comments to make about seeing the film in a fine digitally enhanced DVD format (on a 52"" LCD screen):

1) As Gort carried Patricia Neal towards the saucer I noticed for the first time a network of (not so fine) cables supporting her weight.

2) In the saucer the foam rubber Gort suit laces were clearly visible on the front of the garment(for a fraction of a second) as Gort moved from right to left on  screen exiting the saucer.",1216598400,,1152,4.431279620853081

We are a stupid race of sentients destined for obliteration.  We spend trillions on tanks and fighter jets and nukes while people starve.  Gort should have a field day leveling the planet.

Of course, like any wise American we shot him instantly while offering our own, to quote House of Pain, slogan, eat you up like some butter cups from Reeses I come in peace but you'll leave in pieces.
Following this at exactly noon time today we lost power for 30 minutes.  Do you realize that for thirty minutes we were unable to launch nuclear weapons and missiles.  I don't know if America is prepared for the devastation of not being able to launch missiles could cause.  For those 30 terrifying minutes our cars could not pollute the environment.  The radio and television newscasters could not promote fear and panic.  IT WAS TERRIBLE!

442554,5,6302168465,"This is an excellent film.  However, despite the important message it delivers at the end, I am of the opinion, that films in any age should be used for the sole purpose of entertainment and not for the delivery of political messages.  Morality plays are a different issue and I can see where they may fit into film making.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this film because it is extremely well acted, well directed and well written; and most importantly, very entertaining.",1213315200,3,473,4.814814814814815
442555,5,6302168465,"I find it difficult to believe that individuals continue to find this film a stimulant to simple-minded political critique.  One would think, to read some of the reviews here and elsewhere, that we were still in the middle of the Cold War.  Klaatu and Gort are, to these poor, befuddled souls, archetypes of the Evil Empire, intent on subjugating the people of earth into a huddled, quivering mass of terrified obedience.  I wonder if they bothered to listen to the dialogue...

The quality of the restoration is not bad at all.  The sound track, in particular, sounds quite good.  While one can detect some video artifacts, they should only bother those folk who watch TV screens primarily to detect moires and jaggies.  For the rest of us, the appearance is quite good enough, thank you.

The plot is laden with the usual improbabilities.  Persons who cannot deal with such probably ought not view science fiction.  Only Patricia Neal's obligatory screaming seemed to me contrived and facile.  Otherwise, the writers simply did what writers must do to make a complex story fit within the time frames of American movie-making.

When all the carping and griping is done, this remains THE film by which science fiction of its period will be judged.  It ranks among the very best sci-fi films of all time; a position that it amply earns.",1212451200,2,1335,4.828193832599119
442556,3,6302168465,"I couldn't agree or add much more with the positive reviews already posted here. I first saw this film in the 60's on ""Saturday Night at the Movies"". The film was introduced by the star, Michael Rennie, who spoke to the continued timeliness of the underlying theme of the movie. I now own this particular DVD version of the film and I have to agree with the less favorable reviews of some others give here that focus on the technical failings of this reproduction (not restoration).
Nonetheless the message of this movie is still relevant. I have read that a remake is in production but the focus of Klaatu's concern will be our disregard of the damage being done to our planet in general rather than specifically the nuclear proliferation threat emphasized in the 1951 film. There are also rumors that the film may return to the final twist of the short story ""Farewell to the Master"" written by Harry Bates.

When I ordered this, it was very confusing as there were two ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" DVDs available and I couldn't tell which one was the ""right"" one.  It's not this one.

442626,5,6302168465,"The Day the Earth Stood Still was decades ahead of its time and being made in 1951 truly makes it so.

Not like the cheap junk that followed being stupid looking, jerky, monster aliens that ate, killed, enslaved or mind controlled every human, this movie has a believable story line with real actors, actresses, acting and a plot.

I saw this movie with my Dad and although he's gone now remember being a kid and liking what my Dad liked and that was a good thing.

My father served in WWII and only talked of it when he recalled a funny or interesting story that never contained the death or grossness of war.  He was able to put that behind him and see this movie as entertaining.  As you can read in the inside jacket info the US military (then the War department) would have no part of the movie so the tanks and other military equipment was loaned by the Virginia National Guard.

Remember there was no CGI (computer generated images), heck there weren't even any computers and special effects were extremely limited.  So when and if you watch The Day the Earth Stood Still keep this in mind and don't expect a display of 2000+ technology when this was made in 1951 and before color movies were a must, it is in black and white.  However, you will see real actors, a mostly believable plot and of course remember it was the Winner of the Golden Globe 1951.

The decency of SciFi was not returned to until as far as I remember Star Trek.  Also you'll learn where and what ""Klaatu Barada Nikto"" means.  My son had heard it many times but didn't know where it came from or what it meant until he watched watch The Day the Earth Stood Still with me.

But the 1950's of my childhood was a science fiction orgy and i loved it. If not in the theatre, i managed to catch every one of them as they were replayed on Saturday afternoon tv.
But this movie stood out then as it still does now. The acting, effects, cinematography, direction and especially the script are just top notch.
I have recommended it to my adult friends over the years and except for the occasional jab at it's obviously dated effects, every one of them reacted with the same admiration of the story and it's emotional impact.

Unfortunately, a soldier too quick on his trigger finger shoots him just as his space ship landed on the mall in Washington, DC.  Klaatu escapes US military custody and goes out to evaluate humanity on his own.

""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" shows earthlings at our best and worst.

This is the film that reminds the peacenik in us that those higher powers, you know - the guardians of intergalactic peace we just know are out there, are watching, waiting for that single telltale act of malicious intent from homo sapiens that will bring down every last heat ray of righteous fury the outer space cops can muster and ""leave our world a burned out cinder.""

With the help of a most intriquing figure robot, and sci-fi icon, he hides among the neighborhood as a lone stranger in need of a room to rent. It is the young boy in the house, who with his youthful curiosity, discovers his real true identity. Although he tries to expose him as an alien man nobody, of course, at first believes his story. It's Patricia Neal, well played as the protective mother, who finally confronts the situation, to discover her son was right. Thereby beginning a dramatic tale of questioning his mission here on earth, and if his story on saving the earth's people is justified. Even the worldwide demonstration he ensues, is to become a non-violent example.
As usual, it's the humans that respond violently due to worry, ignorance, and even horror. But Klaatu, finely played by veteran actor Michael Rennie, ultimately delivers his message to the people as United Nations to come to grips with their squabbles, arguments, and downfalls.

442771,5,6302168465,"When I look back over my life, I remember not hearing the name of Michael Rennie until the Rocky Horror Picture show that came out in the 1970's. His name was used in the opening lyrics of the opening song of that movie. Even back then I had wondered what ever happened to the old film ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"".

The story line of this movie is simple: Klatu comes from a far away Galaxy to bring a message to this world to abandone all violence and pursue the pathway of peace and love or be destoyed by its neighboring worlds forming a galactic community of peace.  He is first greeted by being shot by a U.S. soilder after exiting his space craft.  He then escapes the military hospital, where he is kept under close guard; only to mingle with the earthlings and learn of their ways before reporting back to those who sent him for a judgement over this earth. He finally meets the world's top scientist, Professor Bernhardt, where he is asked by Bernhardt to perform a demonstration to the world that will convince everyone we must either stop our violence or be utterly destroyed by the community of planets Klatu represents.  Klatu comes complete with his own military power in a single robot named ""Gort"" which has the power to selectively destroy objects while sparing human flesh of total disintegration. Gort also has the power to destroy the entire planet if need be, we learn.

The property work done to create the space ship seen in this film is very well done, but what really carries this film is not the limited special effects, but the story.  Even though the film is in black and white, the lighting and cinematography in this work is marvelous to say the least.  The only orchestral sound effect used that adds a ""creepiness"" to the feel of the film is the use of a bow on a saw blade.  This was before synthesizers and digital sound were created; so given the limitations of what was available, allot had to be done to focus on a good story to drive home the product.  I remember seeing a fellow demonstrate the use of a bow on a sawblade when I was much younger which is how I can tell the sound was created in the opening music of the film as the picture starts from outer space, while slowly focusing in on the earth, as a suggestion we are following Klatu's journey toward the earth while the opening credits being.

While I was born 11 years after the end of World War II, This film is literally a post World War II peace keeping tool with a powerful message behind it, although it certainly doesn't use a Gandi type approach to solving world peace.  This film is great for the whole family however, including little children: It is also a good topic parents can use for discussion to help their children think when it comes to dealing with the violence and evil this world is subject to. The only real violent scenes are when two military gaurds are totally disintegrated by Gort's light beem and when the military shoot down Klatu while running from the military police to reach a meeting of scientists to give his message.  Even this violent act is redeemed when Gort comes for Klatu's body, takes him to the space ship and restores full life to Klatu's body as a form of resurrection.

While we all dream for either God or a messenger from space coming to knock some sense into this violent ridden planet of ours, so as to teach us we are one fragile small world, the truth is, the burden of making this world work is our own, which this film teaches in its final message.  This story teaches without being preachy, while asking the viewer in the end ""what outcome will you choose for your world?"". The only controversy for discussion with the story premise is that violence is being offered by the worlds Klatu represents, if this world does not turn from its own violence: Kind of like ""There is always a greater bully to bully the bully"" concept.  On one side of the argument, you get a post Nazi dictatorial approach to solving world peace, which the world had just come out of in 1951 with the story line of this film. This would suggest the Universe is as violent as George Lucus's Star Wars.  However, on the other side, you can't help but wonder if the report Klatu will make to his superiors, in the end, will avert the use of destructive force on the earth to get it to depart from its own violent ways.  It is an interesting paradox for study and would have made for a good sequel to this original film.

Regardless, it's great now to have this old 1951 classic gracing my library these days in DVD format.  It never gets old to watch, nor the message of peace it tries to deliver to a post WWII generation, which is my generation.

442825,5,6302168465,"""The Day The World Stood Still"" is a powerful 1951 sci-fi film that I thought was both thought provoking and really enjoyable. The special features on this DVD were really nicely done too.

In the early 1950s, a time of high political tension, a UFO appears over Washington DC, landing in a park. Two strange beings emerge. The first is named Klaatu, resembling a human in a spacesuit, while the other, Gort, is an silent but intimidating robot who can destroy a tank with a glance. Klaatu, despite his peaceful introduction, is shot, and taken to a military hospital. He tells the Major who checks up on him that he has an important message to tell the world, the whole world at once, and wonders if it is possible to assemble the world leaders before him to talk. The Major tells, and shows him, that this isn't possible. The Americans want such a meeting on their terms and territory, the Russians want such a meeting on theirs, etc, etc, etc. Frustrated with the squabbling and mistrust, Klaatu leaves the hospital, taking the name of ""Mr Carpenter"" and mingling with the good citizens of the Capitol. He's able to get away with this because no one knows what he looks like when he's not wearing a spacesuit. Klaatu discovers the paranoia and panic surrounding his arrival, befriends a mother and her son, and meets the smartest of scientists. Will he be able to communicate his important message? How will the world leaders unite? Will Klaatu be found out?

It's a very atmospheric film, and would have been even more so in 1951, the world fresh into the fears of the Cold War. I love the look of the white hot UFO, and the reactions, both mild and extreme of the citizens of Washington. I love how engaging the film is on mostly just dialogue and concepts, it's a great satire. The foreboding score with a hint of theremin is a nice touch too.

Klaatu is an interesting character. Even though he's an alien, he's everything you could want a man of the 1950s to be, mild mannered, nicely dresssed, handsome, intellegent, good with kids, a man eager to listen and understand people's point of view. He's a lot nicer than the father of Billy, the child who Klaatu befriends, a more stoic man who quite categorically says ""I don't care about the world!"" when personal fame and fortune come calling. Klaatu takes the name of ""Carpenter"", stands for peace and love, and has an important message (and important warning) for the world. The leaders don't understand him, but the common people do. Because of these and other reasons, I couldn't help being reminded of a similar, more Biblical, person...

Special features include the original 1951 Movietone newsreel from the premiere of the film, which was great for context, as it featured footage of the Korean War and of a meeting of world leaders. There's also the original theatrical trailer, a featurette on restortation, and a commentary with director Robert Wise, with a chap called Nicholas Meyers asking him about the film. That's not a bad idea, to have someone in the commentary ask questions to the filmmakers. I know some DVD commentaries, where the cast or crew haven't seen the film in a while or pause to remember, don't really know what to say during the commentary, and they would have gained a lot having a third party help them like this.

442829,5,6302168465,"The Day the Earth stood Still (1951)was not only among the very best Science Fiction films, in my view; it was also one of the most courageous. We all know the story; messenger Klaatu (Michael Rennie) is sent to warn the endemical violent nations of Earth that ""if they threaten to extend their petty jealousies and rivalries to the other planets their own planet will be reduced to a burned out cinder"".

The earth creatures make an early start on that ""extension"" by shooting Klaatu the minute he steps off his spaceship.

Apart from being shot by a single panicking soldier, Klaatu soon realises that the world's leaders themselves,have no idea of the dangers their planet faces. The telegrams he urged the American President to send requesting a meeting receive shortsighted, you might even say pompous, rejections.

He then tries to alert the world through the scientific community, in the person of Dr. Barnhardt (Samuel Jaffe); an obvious allusion to Einstein.
Barnhardt, concerned that the world leaders may not see the gravity of the world's situation, asks Klaatu to arrange arranges ""a little demonstration"" of the power at his command.
Klaatu neutralizes the Earth's electrical supply for 30 minutes.

Wise puts his political reputation on the line with this film:
Barnhardt is an obvious reference to Albert Einstein had urged Americans NOT to cooperate with the House un-American Activites Committee. The meeting of international scientists Barnhardt calls at the ship is a reference to the 1949 Peace Conference of Western Soviet Bloc scientists at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. The heated anti-communist demonstrations before the hotel were an indication of the deep suspicion among some Americans that peace-talk was a 'commie trick' to soften the West up for attack.
Bobbie Benson's (Billy Gray) question if atomic power was only for bombs and Klaatu reply that it was for lots of other things too, was highly suspect before Eisenhower's 1954 ""Atoms for Peace,"" address!
The idea of robots like Gort with irrevocable power to destroy planets, was an allusion to world government and loss of national sovereignty smelled of commie totalitarianism.
The studio was worried about using Sam Jaffe because he was suspected of being a commie. Jaffe was in fact blacklisted shortly after ""Day"" and did not work again until 1959.

Still as Kids we loved ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" at the Saturday matinee...and even as children we laughed at the army's conceit in senting their primative tanks to subdue Klaatu's vastly superior technology. The portent Klaatu's departing speech has lost none of its impact.
Yet ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" has lost none of its impact since 1951 and is still something to think about.",1157846400,5,2744,5.088888888888889

442862,5,6302168465,"If I was forced to pick one classic science fiction movie which rises above the rest and one I nearly always watch whenever it's on TV, it would be The Day The Earth Stood Still.  Although shot in black & white with a mono soundtrack and predating digital FX by about 35 years, the film exudes a timeless sense of wonder and authenticity.  Except for the wardrobe and some of the dialogue, the film simply resists dating.  Its sensibilities, immensely effective depiction of an advanced alien visitor and wondrous technology, respect for the discipline of science and its overall core message resonates on for today and will do so far into tomorrow.  The film thoroughly entertains while it challenges us, something sadly missing in the vast majority of films from most any era.

Director Robert Wise wastes no time in getting things started.  As a startled Earth populace watches, an enormous flying saucer spins its way over the USA and makes touchdown in a Washington D.C park.  The military quickly assembles an armada like welcoming committee and when the occupant of the craft emerges, he's promptly shot by a jittery soldier.  And that's when Gort appears.  And when Gort shows up, there's probably going to be trouble.  Gort is a robot. A gleaming silver, amazingly smooth robot who stands nearly ten feet tall.  From appearances he's forged from a solid hunk of metal - with no discernable seams, rivets or bolts.  A thin visor on his head shows the only break in the surface of his body and when it opens, a eerie hum issues forth.  With a brilliant beam of light, Gort's disintegrator ray slags several large army cannons into steaming junk heaps.  The assemblage is shocked and the audience captivated.  And barely ten minutes of film time has passed.

Talk about big openings!

Michael Rennie plays Klattu, the sole occupant and pilot of the flying saucer and keeper of Gort.  In due course we learn that although Klattu controls Gort in many ways, Gort's prime directive programming overrides that of all other orders - that of total non-violence.  In effect, Gort is a cosmic police officer, patrolling the spaceways in search of offenders to his central purpose - keeping the peace.  At one point, Patricia Neal turns to Rennie and wonders, ""What could Gort do alone?""  Klattu looks deadly serious, ""What couldn't he do....  He could destroy your planet.""  And before leaving Klattu once again emphasizes the power of the Gort robots, their full autonomy to carry out their prime orders and the strict adherence on the part of his people to the philosophy.  ""We have a system.  We don't pretend it's perfect, but we have a system and it works.""

So then Klattu's people have achieved total planetary or in this case galactic non-violence.  Full autonomy was given to machines to carry out that philosophy.  Think about that for several minutes.  So if Klattu had lost it and had gone postal - if he started using his abilities to harm the people of Earth - then Gort would turn his awesome destructive power onto Klattu to restore order.  This appears to be a simplistic answer - an eye for an eye - a hit for hit.  But if there was a massive army of incorruptible & virtually indestructible beings who would severely punish any violent offender - who would be the first to step out line?  Sure wouldn't be me!  Maybe there on to something.  Of course you'd have to ensure that the machines would never falter or make an error in judgment - if even one did according to Klattu then the results would be catastrophic.  If this occurred, would then other Gorts step in?  Would they have to put down their renegade peer?  Entertaining and challenging - no?

All sorts of questions arise about a system like this.  How could living things put their trust and ultimate safety in the hands of machines?  What if the scenario turned into a nightmare one like the Terminator movies?  Machines designed for destruction going out of control and trying to exterminate the race which created them.  But don't we put out trust and safety into machines now - everyday?  Complex computer programs guide airplanes, trains and even the Space Shuttle.  Yes, accidents do happen, but that's the cost of progress and automation.  Ok enough philosophizing back to the review.

Without qualification Michael Renie is the reason why this film is a classic.  Patricia Neal and Hugh Marlowe both hold their own with him, and Billy Gray as the boy Klaatu befriends is likeable and believable, but it's Rennie which makes the film soar.  His appearance, manner and voice combine to create the benevolent alien we wish would actually visit Earth.  Although the ultimate message he brings us is one of caution and self-control or utter annihilation of our species will surely follow, his offering of a gift of information in the opening scene tells us that he and his race will treat us with compassion and friendship unless we choose otherwise.  It's the sort of movie that one takes away something new from each viewing and multiple viewings are highly advised.

The DVD is worthy of this film classic.  Navigating fun animated menus, you'll find yourself going back to the film, great documentary and audio commentary again and again.",1154736000,4,5224,4.805836139169473

But the neat thing about ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) is that we are not bombarded with special effects.  Consequently, as in the style of Alfred Hitchcock, we are teased, and when the special effects do happen, both visual and audio along with Bernard Herrmann's fantastic music, we are jolted and amazed and caught up in the story.

This has to rank as the best science-fiction movie ever made.  The script (Edmund North) along with the story and the acting move forward at a nice pace with blips along the way to shake us up from time to time.  Of course, there is the direction of the late Robert Wise, and that directing is the thread which holds the movie together, on track, and keeps it on course and so intriging.

Bernard Herrmann was one of the very best of film composers.  He showed us that in ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Psycho,"" etc.  And his music in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" was outstandingly  contemporary.  Let's face it.  The movie would not have succeeded without it.

""THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL"" WAS MEANT TO BE: An entertaining way to persuasively put forth an anti-war argument. This it does quite well and without getting bogged down in subplots. This film also is rather chilling -- even today

IT TURNED OUT TO BE: A TIMELESS SCI-FI CLASSIC!

WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?:

Our neighbors are getting a little nervous now that we've combined nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. They know we're coming into their backyard and they don't want a loose cannon in their solar system. The aliens came to give the Earth a warning -- that by threatening danger [nuclear proliferation in space], they were themselves provoking danger.

SO:

They send a diplomatic mission in the form of one humanoid and one robot plus one flying saucer to Washington! Naturally, this isn't Kool and the Gang with our military who promptly show up on the scene and . . . . . . SHOOT THE ALIEN - NATURALLY! Just as naturally, Gort [the robot] used his laser vision to give the army a little dose of attitude adjustment and . . . . .

NEXT: [Warning: some of the plot elements are discussed below]

Klaatu, the humanoid alien played by Michael Rennie, was sent to Walter Reed Army Hospital for some much needed treatment for a gunshot wound. A representative from the State Department explained why he could not speak to the Earth's leaders, but might instead have a chummy meeting with our President. After declining the generous offer, Klaatu was told that he is essentially under house arrest. Naturally, Klaatu easily removed himself from custody and now was faced with a dilemma.

HOW TO TELL ""ALL"" THE EARTH'S PEOPLE WHAT THEIR SITUATION IS?

Here in lies the heart of this film and here was where it really distinguished itself as a classic, regardless of genre. Since there was no way this plan of Klaatu's could ever go by the numbers, he was forced, at great personal risk, to take it on the lam, so to speak, and IMPROVISE.

After securing lodging with the natives, Klaatu set out to chat with the local Einstein, Dr. Barnhardt [Sam Jaffe], which was NOT without incident. After his improvised meeting with Dr. Barnhardt, Klaatu decided to provide a ""demonstration"" for ""all Earth's people"" which was very novel and very powerful, without using a lot of special effects.

Now that Klaatu had the world's attention, a meeting was called by Barnhardt of all the Earth's leading scientists. This meeting, it was hoped, would be the vehicle through which Klaatu's warning would be delivered to every head of state.

EARTH'S FATE IS UP IN THE AIR:

There was still time for a lot to go wrong, and it did. Not being satisfied with almost killing Klaatu, the army shot him again [in the street and in the back] and this time he was dead -or so he appeared! Patricia Neal as Helen Benson now had her chance to save the world by courageously seeking out Gort the Robot who by then had burned his way out of the ""plastic resin"" that he was encased in [neat effect] and had disintegrated two armed guards. She uttered three words, ""Klaatu - Barata - Necto"" and Gort immediately was on track to collect and revive Klaatu, thereby putting off, for the moment at least, the total destruction of the Earth.

A FAREWELL TO ARMS:

The meeting is a brief one at ""the ship"". Klaatu addresses Barnhardt and Earth's scientists, giving them the fast and dirty version of what's going to happen to the Earth ... if. During the confusion of the address, Mrs. Benson exits the ship and Klaatu re-enters his flying saucer and leaves for somewhere far from Earth.

TERRIFIC AGELESS CLASSIC:

They don't come any better than this. When special effects are needed, by Gort, for instance, they are effective and used in reasonable measure. The Bernard Herrmann score raises the level of suspense whenever it is needed. Rennie, Neal and Jaffe are wonderful in their roles but Billy Gray as Bobby Benson (Neal's son) was a real scene stealer, especially when he tours Washington with Klaatu. Robert Wise keeps the film very tight, well-paced, and concise. Now, 55 years after its release, this film looks like a modern period piece as the issues are still relevant and the delivery is timeless.

ABOUT THE DVD -- EXCELLENT RESTORATION IS HUGE IMPROVEMENT VS. VHS!

This is one of the best restorations of a 55-year-old film. It includes a 70-minute documentary plus trailers, a photo gallery, and film commentary. Director Robert Wise, Star Patricia Neal, and Producer Julian Blaustein are wonderfully engaging and informative. Wise and Blaustein's enthusiasm coupled with Neal's playful approach to the film makes this documentary a rare, fun treat to watch.

One of the greatest sci-fi/message films within this genre is the '51 classic, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still.' Even now, some 55 years since its theatrical release it delivers a timely, almost prophetic message to the world that is more important today than ever.

The message is just as valid today as it was in 1951 when it looked like we were going to blow each other up with atomic bombs.

I usually do not buy Full-Screen DVDs of old movies, since it is not vital to have them, if you own their VHS counterpart. Sometimes, the old transfers are even better than the newly, so-called restored versions.

But in this case I made an exception and was truly impressed by the difference.

Much clearer sound (true Digital Stero), excellent Contrast resolution of the Black & White tones.

A Masterpiece. Bravo!

This tiny Sci-Fi picture of 1951, starring a then unknown actor, Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal and Sam Jaffe is more a metaphor and an answer to the anti-communist ""witch-hunt"" and cold war ambience in which the U.S. Government had thrown the Nation.

Partly borrowing from the Bible, the Hero, the visiting Alien (Michael Rennie) appropriately calls himself ""Mr. Carpenter"", and as in the Bible, he comes to bring peace to a world gone mad.

Mind you, I am not a believer, but having been raised Catholic, its part of my heavy burden, hence I know about such things.

Now, back to the movie and its value.

To express it in just a few words, one can only say that it is a small Gem of a picture.

Never boring, always entertaining, and with a message of all things!

Even the primitive special effects of the day are forgivable, considering the smooth, perfect and natural acting of all involved.

Sam Jaffe, one of the best character actors of those years is simply perfect as the scientist meeting Mr. Carpenter.

It is evident that an allusion to Albert Einstein was made there.

Patricia Neal, is yes, the ""weak"" link of the movie, having to play the mother and housewife figure, but in the end, isn't she who helps the Alien to make contact with the ""minds"" of the planet?

Think about it, we are in the midst of the Korean War, at the beginning of the Cold War, in which housewise usually did not go roaming around in worldwide adventures, limiting themselves to cook, clean and keep husbands and children happy.

No, in this movie, in 1951, we see a conventional woman, who overcomes her fears and actually helps our hero complete his mission.

Anti-conventional you say? You bet!

The entire move is weaved with care and is well told. Oh, and ah yes, storytelling.

Talking about storytelling, this is one example in which storytelling is truly everything. Consider the fact that this movie is just about 90 minutes in length.

Nowadays, if they were to remake it (let's hope not!), it would go overboard into a full-fledged 2 hours and 20 minutes long movie. Boring!

Sometimes I ask myself what writers had back then, that they don't have anymore.

Creativity? You bet!

Originality? You got it!

Imagination? Well said!

Writers in those days (and mind you, in those days, writers had a far harder life than today, especially with all those darned censorship limitations, not forgetting the McCarthy's blacklist), still knew how to KISS (short for: keep it short stupid) and still keep the audience gripped and glued to their seats.

Today, unless you have a Circus for a movie (meaning tons of sex and special effects) you wouldn't keep a horse awake.

My passionate feeling is to suggest to you to buy it.

You won't be sorry, even if you, and I would expect such argument, are not a sci-fi aficionado or fan.

This is one of those movies that speaks to one's humanity and most hidden, inner feelings.

And still, in its simplicity, it is also a spectacular picture that I am sure, will be remembered and mentioned in schools in decades to come, as what it is: a tiny Gem.

442913,5,6302168465,"A golden braid on the silver screen: From The Day the Earth Stood Still, to The Sound of Music, to Lost in Space...

A great sci-fi flick with great effects-which remarkably seems to lose absolutely nothing by being in black-and-white.

The famous line from the film, ""Gort: Klaatu, Barada, Nikto,"" can be broken down a bit--

Klaatu is a mild-mannered from space walking the earth incognito, but with a peaceful dignity that makes him very likable.  He also has a metallic Super alter-ego, Gort.  Gort is the awesome effect of the film--though through suggestion/direction/lighting idea-of-the-thing, as much as through technical special effect.  Gort is a strong, silent type (never says a word, and doesn't even have eyes--just an opaque visor, which opens not to see, but to emit a disintegration beam), an apparently invincible, 8 feet tall police robot which utilizes the nano-technological capability (before anyone thought about nano-technology) to have solid metal bend and seamlessly heal as though it were liquid--while remaining solid (a technique also used by the spaceship Klaatu and Gort came to earth in).  And this 50 years before the Terminator!

I don't know what barada, nikto means, but if you don't remember it, the earth will be destroyed.

This film is about mood.  Its mood is so thick you can cut it, which is fine, because it will seamlessly heal itself.  And it is delicious.

A visitor from outer space befriending boy who lost his father in war.  (The boy will later go on to be the son of Father-Knows-Best--i.e., a prepubescent, Billy Gray, will become teenage ""son"" of Robert Young on TV, there called, ""Bud."") They walk together through Arlington national cemetery, stopping beneath the Lincoln Memorial, observing, ""those are great words,"" and then go on to visit a generic Albert Einstein played by frizzy-haired will-be Dr. Zorba (chief of neurosurgery in the 60's TV show Ben Casey) to calmly talk about an inflexible plan for world peace.  It can't quite be described--but somehow it works, and very well.  Timeless.  Brilliant.  Perfect.

Yet I don't think it would work if it weren't for two things: The music, and the excellent direction from Robert Wise (who went on to direct The Sound of Music).  Cosmic coincidence?--One of the children from the Sound of Music went on to star in the TV series Lost in Space-a show which borrowed a few parts of the music from The Day the Earth Stood Still-and got a lot of milage out of just those parts...the whole series.  (Michael Rennie even guest starred--playing, of course, an alien--in a two-part episode of Lost in Space, called ""The Keeper,"" which was complete with an extra helping of music from The Day the Earth Stood Still.)  Coincidence or no, it shows the power of the film to MAKE icons and cliches.

Not that the acting was bad, or that the plot was not interesting.  On the contrary.  But it wouldn't work without the perfect chemistry that it has-and the music and the direction which seals it together.

I suppose the majority of visitor-from-space flicks are about invasions.  This film is among the delightful minority.  But I wonder if it is unique in that the visitor here actually comes to save us.

If you are not a Patricia Neal fan, you probably will be after watching this film-for she should have gotten an academy award for successfully keeping a straight face (as she later reported having trouble doing).  Because it was worth it.  Her character also has a quiet dignity making her a strong woman of 1951, the earthly soul-mate of Klaatu and his only confidant!

This film deals with the ""Copernican"" theme of seeing the earth as a speck-of-dust, yet here the trump card is simply the respect for all rational beings, wherever they may be.  And so the earth doesn't spin--it stands still...",1140307200,7,3804,4.886115444617785
442914,5,6302168465,"A silver saucer descends from the sky right in the heart of Washington D.C. From its' innards rise a man clothed in silver and an imposing robot with the power to destroy everything in its' path.  But it is not the visitor who sours humanity's first encounter with extraterrestrial life, but a jittery army private who was too scared of what he saw to register the first words that came out of the visitors mouth ""We Come in Peace, and with Goodwill.""

So begins ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" a film that was so ridicuously ahead of its' time that its' relevance remains wholly intact today.  During a decade when science fiction films played off people's fears of the invading red menace for visceral thrills, director Robert Wise (The Sound of Music) and screenwriter Edward H. North did an about face and took on cold war fears and ignorance head on.  In doing so, they created a modern parable not only about the dangers of nuclear weapons and the insane arms race (as timely now as it ever was), but about human ignorance (the ""knee-jerk"" reaction) and on the basic truth that the actions of one entity, be it a man, a planet or an alien, has consequences for those around him as well as himself.

The alien, named Klatthu (a perceptive and soulful Michael Rennie) travels to earth with his robot Gort to warn humanity that their atomic race will lead to their destruction.  One way or another, they will be decimated.  But his peaceful, rational mission is met with irrational suspicion, fear and violence by the people he was trying to save.  To avoid capture while at the same time attempt to spread his message to the whole world, regardless of political creed, Klatthu takes the name of ""Carpenter"" and lives with a wife and son (the terrific pair of Patricia Neal and Billy Gray).  He learns the good that humanity can have, as well as the evil that is spawned from ignorance and fear.  It is because of this fear and suspicion that he finds that the only way to gain humanity's attention is to pull the plug on the entire world and be the subject of a miracle.

It is true that the effects don't hold up as well (a metal robot is not supposed to have a a crease in his breastplate or knees) but it is still impossible not to marvel at the technical skill of director Robert Wise.  His masterful command of light and shadow deepen the slowly building tension throughout the story, complementing while never overwhelming.  But as good as Wise is with the technical aspects, he's even better with story, theme and character, and with ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" he crafted, quite simply, one of the best movies ever made.",1139702400,5,2638,4.563559322033898

Stellar performances abound with Patricia Neal and Michael Rennie as the main characters.

Upon arriving on earth, Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and his robot, Gort, set out to find a scientist who is on the verge of writing a program of the utmost secrecy.  In fact, Klaatu discovers it and completes the equation, with a surprised scientist left speechless.  Like ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", our protaganist has ways to pay for things he needs.  He uses diamonds.

When discovered whom he really is, Patricia Neal escorts Klaatu about and ends up ultimately saving him from our own natural path of destruction.

Rennie gives a career-defining performance as the Christ-like, benevolent authority figure trying to give those war-mongering earthmen a chance before he blows their insignificant planet out of the firmament.

This film could also be compared to 'Casablanca' inasmuch as it has risen to cult status out of the Hollywood treadmill, a film that was hoped to simply make its money back and disappear.

The cast is rock-solid here with the exception of the very wooden Hugh Marlowe. Sam Jaffe is splendid as the  Einstein-like Professor Barnhardt, here employed against much studio opposition as he was under investigation by the McCarthy tribunal at the time.

Klaatu's final speech to the scientists before leaving has lost none of its cold and icy resonance in the 50+ years since this was made.

The DVD has some good extras, the best of which is the endearingly doddery commentary by veteran director Robert Wise, here aided by fellow 'Star Trek' director Nicholas Meyer.

Interesting note: the now famous words 'Klaatu barada nikto' do seem to have exactly the kind of Russian resonance that made the Army refuse to cooperate in the production of this film. 'Nikto' means 'nothing' in Russian, so a good guess as to what the phrase might mean is 'Klaatu says do nothing', i.e. Don't destroy the Earth.",1133222400,10,1436,5.008403361344538
442948,5,6302168465,"March 4, 2003, was a great day for Sci-Fi movie fans -- that's the day when one of the very best science-fiction movies of all-time was finally released on the DVD format by Twentieth Century Fox. That movie being one of my eternal faves, 1951's ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", directed by the great Robert Wise (who sadly passed away on September 14th, 2005, just four days after his 91st birthday).

I regard Mr. Wise as one of the top American directors of his time. In addition to this film, Wise also helmed two other motion pictures that are among my favorites -- ""The Haunting"" (1963) and ""Executive Suite"" (1954). Plus, of course, Wise also directed ""West Side Story"" in 1961 and ""The Sound Of Music"" in 1965, with both of those films earning the highest of all possible honors, each capturing the ""Best Picture"" Oscar at the Academy Awards.

I can watch ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" over and over again, and never get tired of it. It was made well prior to the computer-enhanced days of ""CGI"" (premiering in U.S. movie theaters on September 18, 1951), and relies mainly on a well-told story, rather than concentrating on the ""body count"" or continually feeling the need to blow something to smithereens (although a few pieces of Army artillery do suffer as a result of that ""Laser Beam""/""Death Ray"" that is utilized, when needed, by that most imposing of all robots, ""Gort"", who was played by the 7-foot-7 Lock Martin).

But, despite the lack of extra-fancy CGI-type special effects, I think the circa 1951 effects used for TDTESS hold up pretty well even in the 21st century. The ""disappearing tanks and guns"" scene has a fairly realistic look to it, via the time-lapse photography method employed. And Gort's ""death ray"" doesn't seem overly phony either (from a photography standpoint).

I have to admire the tenacity of Robert Wise, and the creative team who put TDTESS together, for even WANTING to ""test the waters"" (so to speak) and produce a film that contains such heavy and controversial ""end-of-the-world"" type of subject matter (especially in 1951, just six years after the bomb was dropped on Japan in World War II). Back in '51, the idea of ""nuclear holocaust"" was probably more than merely a distant thought in the minds of many Americans.

But I'm glad that Mr. Wise and company persevered and brought this quintessential sci-fi drama to the screen. It has stood the test of many decades' worth of time, and will no doubt stand many more to come.

This intelligently-written black-and-white film classic stars Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe, Billy Gray, and Frances Bavier. Plus, as mentioned before, the huge presence (literally) of Lock Martin as ""Gort"", who was one of the tallest actors ever to work in Hollywood films.

41-year-old England-born actor Michael Rennie does very well in the film as the alien (""Klaatu"") sent to Earth to urge us to save our planet from certain destruction if we Earthlings continue to experiment with atomic energy (which Klaatu predicts will be ""applied to spaceships"" in the foreseeable future).

Rennie's very controlled (dual) performance as ""Klaatu"" and ""Mr. Carpenter"" (who looks and talks exactly like English-speaking Earth folk) I think is a strong asset to this movie. He strikes just the right chords throughout the film. He's an ""alien being"" from an unknown far-away planet, sure. But he's far from being a ""monster"" of any sort. Instead, he's very likeable (despite the fact he's threatening to ""eliminate"" Planet Earth, and reduce it to a ""burned-out cinder"", if dire circumstances should warrant that action).

It's difficult to dislike Klaatu even after he delivers his impressive movie-concluding ultimatum to the people of Earth (""Your choice is simple...join us and live in peace; or pursue your present course and face obliteration""). Maybe it's the British accent -- but I just flat-out like the guy, funny-looking space suit and all. :-)

The movie contains several wonderfully-subtle moments where we can sense the true ""alien"" status of Klaatu. One such well-scripted occasion is when Klaatu/Carpenter opens up a musical box and is a bit surprised and amused when he hears a tune coming from within this 'odd' object. The idea of a box that emits music had been completely ""alien"" to him. It's a small but well-written moment in the picture.

Another scene of that sort which reminds the audience that Klaatu is from another world is so short that if you blink you will miss it (and you'd also miss its perfect visual subtlety) -- When ""Mr. Carpenter"" first meets ""Tom Stevens"" (Hugh Marlowe), Stevens holds out his hand to shake the hand of Carpenter. But this ""hand-shaking"" practice is obviously totally foreign to Mr. Carpenter, as he looks down at Marlowe's outstretched hand in bewilderment for just a brief moment, before ""catching on"" and holding out his own hand to be grasped.

Other similar examples of this ""new kid on the planet"" nature crop up throughout the movie, such as when Carpenter appears puzzled by the notion of being asked to ""take a hand"" of a different sort -- a card-playing ""hand"" during a game of gin rummy. These ill-at-ease moments exhibited by the quick-on-his-feet alien make up part of the rich underlying fabric of the film, and are nearly-imperceptible pieces of splendid writing by the author of the film's screenplay, Edmund H. North.

I've also always enjoyed 13-year-old Billy Gray in this movie. Gray (""Bud"" in the TV series ""Father Knows Best"") is excellent in the role of Patricia Neal's son, giving a performance that comes across as very relaxed and natural. He doesn't seem to be acting at all. I doubt if the casting director could have made a better choice for the part of ""Bobby Benson"" than Billy Gray.

One of my favorite (and humorous) lines of dialogue in the film is spoken by Gray -- ""You don't seem to know much about anything, do you Mr. Carpenter?"" (If only Billy knew just how untrue that line is.) ~wink~

Billy Gray was by no means new to the world of feature film-making when he gave his spirited performance in ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"". Billy had already appeared in literally dozens of films by the time he was 13. TDTESS, in fact, was his 8th movie part during JUST the calendar year of 1951! And he was in 9 others the previous year! Billy's first movie role was in 1943's ""Man Of Courage"". He was 5 years old at the time.

Frances Bavier (who nine years later would be co-starring as ""Aunt Bee"" in ""The Andy Griffith Show"") also does quite nicely in her small part as ""Mrs. Barley""; and 60-year-old Sam Jaffe is ideally cast in his role as ""Professor Barnhardt"". Jaffe adds a little bit of humor to the film as well (""There are several thousand questions I'd like to ask you"").

And then there's another ""co-star"", of sorts -- that being: the delightfully-eerie musical score composed by Bernard Herrmann, which never fails to send multiple chills down the spine of the listener. Herrmann's incredible music for TDTESS is, IMO, one of the best scores ever written for any motion picture, sci-fi variety or otherwise. It fits this movie to a perfect ""tee"". The fabulous theme music that opens the film is just incomparable.

I highly recommend this movie's soundtrack album, too. Varese Records issued a newly-packaged version of the soundtrack CD on the exact same day the DVD of the film was released (March 4th, 2003).

A writing gaffe, ya think? ..........

Almost every movie is plagued by a few unintentional bloopers or plot holes or writing errors and such. And TDTESS is no exception. Most fans of the film know of the ""visible wires"" that can be briefly seen on screen as Patricia Neal is being carried to the spaceship by robot Gort. And in that same scene, the ""zipper"" on the front of Lock Martin's ""Gort suit"" can be seen.

But here's a more subtle writing goof that I've noticed when watching the film .... I've always wondered why a more detailed physical description of Klaatu (or, for that matter, ANY description) was not made available to the public after Klaatu's escape from Washington's Walter Reed Hospital.

Several people got a good look at Klaatu when he wasn't wearing the face-covering 'get-up' he was decked out in during his first scene in the movie. Nurses, doctors, and ""Mr. Harley"" certainly could have given a description to the authorities or to a Radio/Television audience.

But, according to the TV bulletin provided by newsman Drew Pearson (aka ""Drear Pooson"" to fans of ""The Jack Benny Program""; ROFL!!), there was no physical description of Klaatu given out whatsoever. (Pearson just showed a picture of him in his ""Klaatu Suit"", which he was wearing upon his unannounced arrival in Washington ""at Three Forty-Seven PM Eastern Standard Time"").

Now, if an alien who is possibly bent on destroying the world were on the loose, I think I'd want as much information on the subject that I could get. But, I guess it was just too difficult a task to ask those few individuals who actually DID see Klaatu's outer features for a description of the visitor from outer space. ~LOL!~

To be perfectly fair to the filmmakers in this ""lack of Klaatu description"" regard -- I suppose that we, the viewers of this flick, could just assume that a better description of Klaatu WAS issued at some point via TV and/or radio, and any such info simply didn't make it into the movie's screenplay. However, if this is to be ""assumed"", I'd then begin to wonder why the people who set up house with the alien didn't realize, from any such description they might have been exposed to after he began living under their roof, that this stranger in their midst just might be the most-hunted ""foreigner"" ever to drop from the heavens. Oh well....just alien food for thought.

Then, too, from strictly a moviemaking perspective, if Mrs. Benson and company HAD been privy to a perfect description of the alien, and had subsequently blown the whistle on him, then I guess we'd have had only about a 15-minute movie. Klaatu needs to stay anonymous for the majority of the film, otherwise the screenplay goes down the tubes. :-)

More snafus in the 'credibility' departmart......

There's also the fact that Klaatu was able to waltz right out of the hospital without a single person noticing his escape, which could also be referred to as a script ""blunder"", I suppose. Talk about your lax security measures with an alien creature on the premises! But, perhaps Klaatu went into ""stealth"" mode as he slipped past hospital personnel. ;)

In addition, another completely-implausible ""security-lacking"" detail occurs later in the film, when Gort clobbers the two MPs stationed outside the ship. For goodness sake! We've been invaded by a flying saucer from another world, and all we can afford for protection are TWO MEASLY GUARDS??!! They could have AT LEAST posted Barney Fife alongside these two guards for additional protection against ""this menace from another world""! Barney could have gotten off at least one shot in case of trouble. (He only carried one bullet, ya know.) ~uncontrolled laughter ensues here~ ;)

But, when all is said and done, any boners that might exist in the script don't really matter a great deal -- because even with a few gaps in logic here and there, ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" shall forever remain a cinema masterpiece in this writer's steadfast opinion.

----------------

The DVD version of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" shines brightly in virtually every respect, doing full justice to this motion picture. The B&W Full-Frame (1.33:1 OAR) photography looks excellent via this nearly-flawless film-to-DVD transfer performed by 20th Century Fox.

The disc offers up plenty of audio choices to listen to as well. There are a total of five Dolby Digital audio tracks on the DVD -- English 2.0 Stereo; English 2.0 Mono; Spanish 2.0 Mono; French 2.0 Mono; plus a Commentary Track in English 2.0 Stereo. Subtitles are available also (in both English and Spanish).

Note re. language options: I took notice recently of a rather curious thing re. the Spanish audio track on this DVD -- some of the background music has been completely changed for this Spanish track (particularly noticeable in Chapter 15, during the film's final scene). The substituted musical cues are nothing like the Bernard Herrmann-created music. I'm not entirely sure, however, if this kind of music alteration for foreign-language DVD audio tracks is a common practice or not (because I rarely bother to check out any non-English tracks on any DVD products). Maybe it is common; I don't know. But I thought the changing of the music here for the Spanish audio was kind of a strange and unnecessary thing to do.

This DVD is double-sided (so no pictures on the disc), with the 92-minute film and a couple of special features located on Side A, and a handsome array of additional bonus items accessible on Side B.

Bonus Material includes.........

>> An Audio Commentary Track by Robert Wise and Nicholas Meyer. Recorded in 1995, this is the same Commentary that appeared on a LaserDisc edition of the movie.

>> An interesting feature-length ""making-of"" documentary, ""Making The Earth Stand Still"". ... This cleverly-titled featurette was made in 1995 for the Special-Edition LaserDisc release of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"".

There's not much in the way of sparkling production values attached to this piece. No music score at all, and no end credits whatsoever. But I very much enjoyed the interviews and hearing about how this great sci-fi film was put together. Director Robert Wise and the film's producer, Julian Blaustein, appear in on-camera interviews discussing in some depth how the movie was made. Blaustein recorded his portions of this documentary only a very short time before he passed away (he died in June of 1995).

Plus, we also get to see and hear others who were connected with the film too, including co-stars Patricia Neal and Billy Gray. Patricia, at age 69, looks absolutely lovely here I might add.

This ""Stand Still"" bonus has 15 separate chapter breaks (and a Scene Selection DVD Sub-Menu). It runs for 80 minutes and features Full-Frame 1.33:1 video and DD 2.0 Stereo for the audio. No subtitles are provided.

Note: The DVD box claims that this program lasts 70 minutes, but the total length is actually ten minutes longer than that.

>> A 1951 ""Movietone Newsreel"" (Length: 6:20).

>> A film ""Restoration Comparison"".

>> The Theatrical Trailer for the film (2:08). ... TDTESS experts will quickly notice the ""alternate"" versions of some scenes and dialogue that have been used for the trailer here. Very subtle differences in some of the line readings, but noticeable to those who have seen this movie dozens of times.

>> 2 Bonus Movie Trailers. ... For the films ""One Million Years B.C."" (1966) and ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"" (1959).

>> 6 ""Still Galleries"". ... These Photo Galleries are excellent, and quite extensive in scope. Setting aside about an hour or so for viewing these Galleries wouldn't be a bad idea (and even longer than that if you want to read the entire ""Shooting Script"" from start to finish). Each of the six photo sections contains dozens upon dozens of images.

Some very interesting ""behind-the-camera"" photos are provided here. I was surprised that this many behind-the-scenes type of pictures existed for this old movie. It's nice to know that a lot of this great stuff has survived in the Fox archives for all these years since the film's 1951 debut. This is fun stuff to scroll through to be sure.

The Photo Galleries are broken into six different sections, which are labelled as follows:

#1.) ""Production""

#2.) ""Scene And Set Photos""

#3.) ""Shooting Script""

#4.) ""Construction Blue Prints For The Ship""

#5.) ""American And British Pressbooks""

#6.) ""Posters, Lobby Cards, Spaceship Model And Gort""

All of these Photo Galleries are viewable in an ""at-your-own-pace"" manner. I.E., the ""forward"" remote button must be pressed to advance to the next image or script page. No ""timed"" track is utilized here.

The #3 Gallery -- the ""Shooting Script"" -- consists of pictures of all the script pages of the ""Revised Final"" shooting script of TDTESS (dated February 21, 1951). Fascinating stuff. If you know each line of the film verbatim, it's very interesting to note the slight changes in dialogue from the original script to what was ultimately filmed. Plus, there are a few intriguing deleted scenes revealed in this ""Shooting Script"" Gallery. One such deletion that I enjoyed was a cut made during the first ""Walter Reed Hospital"" scene. The Army General and ""Major White"" were supposed to have this conversation at the beginning of the scene (which was ultimately cut).....

General: ""How is he {Klaatu}?""

Major White: ""He's alright, General. Blood pressure's a little high, but it could be aggravation.""

General (wryly): ""Can't blame him. I always get mad when somebody shoots me.""

Major White: ""He still wants to see the President.""

Colonel (to General): ""We informed the White House over an hour ago.""

General: ""Didn't drop any hints about where he's from, did he?""

Major White: ""No, sir, he didn't.""

[The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain enters.]

Captain (to the Colonel): ""Excuse me. What about the reporters, Colonel? They're swarming all over the lobby.""

[The Colonel turns, in deference, to the General.]

General (quietly): ""Tell them there won't be any statement tonight.""

Captain: ""Yes sir.""

At this point, Mr. Harley (the White House secretary) enters, which is the point at which the scene begins in the final version of the film.

----------------

The DVD packaging is A-OK too. TDTESS is ""#5"" in Fox Home Entertainment's series of titles presented under its ""Studio Classics"" label. An image of ""Gort"" and the spaceship dons the front cover. The DVD's cover photo is okay (albeit a little bland), but I myself would have preferred either a replica of some of the original '51 poster art to grace this front cover, or possibly the same cover that was used for the 1998 VHS version of the movie, which is much more colorful and fun-looking.

I'm thankful, though, that Fox didn't recycle its cover design from the earlier 1991 VHS edition of TDTESS, which included a photo that falsely represents the relationship between Patricia Neal's and Michael Rennie's characters in the film (consisting of a silly-looking, lovey-dovey, cheek-to-cheek pose of Neal and Rennie, giving the impression that the pair were starry-eyed lovers in the movie, which is not accurate at all).

That ""romantic"" publicity photo always makes me want to burst out laughing when I see it. Some viewers of this film might be of the opinion that ""Helen Benson"" and ""Klaatu"" had 'amore' on their minds, but I'd disagree. IMO, Helen's personal feelings toward Klaatu didn't go much beyond ""respect"" and ""admiration"" by the film's final act. But I suppose that's part of the beauty of ""the movies"" -- each viewer can take from the film whatever he or she deems fit to take from it (perceived ""romance"" and all, if desired). ;)

A four-page mini-booklet is also included inside the Keep Case, with some production notes about the film and some trivia stuff too. The last page of the paper insert has a ""Scene Selection"" Guide (the movie is divided up into a total of 15 chapters/scenes). The front of the 4-page enclosure also sports a picture of one of the movie's original advertising posters. Some great artwork was created to promote this film in 1951, and a few pictures of original posters and lobby cards can be found in one of the Photo Galleries on this DVD as well.

The DVD Menus are kind of neat too, featuring a bit of animation upon disc load-up (including some of Drew Pearson's ""bulletins"" from the film); but the initial animated parts can be easily skipped with the click of a button or two. And the other junk that always appears whenever a DVD is put into the player can be rapidly bypassed too, if desired (e.g.: FBI warnings and misc. disclaimers). Fox Home Video is usually pretty good about not including any kind of ""forced-to-watch-it"" pre-Menu stuff on its DVDs. ~tips cap to them for that~

A portion of the famous theremin-heavy TDTESS theme music plays while the Main DVD Menu is on the screen (both sides of the disc). The music will repeat endlessly, but that's not too bad here, IMO, because it's a fantastic piece of music.

A nifty little thing happens when ""Play"" is selected from the Main Menu (to start up the feature presentation) -- After clicking ""Play"", Gort appears for a moment and then proceeds to ""vaporize"" the screen with his handy Death Ray. The screen then dissolves into nothingness for an instant prior to the beginning of the movie. A clever mood-enhancing little ""segue"" to start the movie-watching session.

----------------

Any DVD collector with a yen for great Sci-Fi flicks will certainly want to own this top-flight disc of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"". I can't think of a single reason for not adding this DVD to the home library's movie archives. (They're probably even collecting and enjoying this title on Gort's planet.)

Final Words -- ""Klaatu...Barada...Nikto"". (There, I said it. You didn't expect to get through this whole tome of a review without hearing that popular phrase/axiom at least once...did you? How good could any ""Stood Still"" essay be without the inclusion of those three cryptic words?) :-)",1131840000,27,21474,4.890418502202643
442949,5,6302168465,"If you are building a vintage collection, then you should include this one. Although filmed in black and white, the director (Robert Wise) makes very good use of light and shadow along with an effective score to create mood, suspense and even fear. Michael Rennie as the alien visitor Klaatu and Patricia Neal as Helen, Klaatu's earthly love (?) interest headline the movie, and both give excellent performances.

Sent to Earth by the Federation of Planets with a warning not to spread nuclear weapons to space or else the FoP (through Klaatu and his robot policeman, Gort) will have no choice but to destroy the planet. Klaatu's mission is to assemble all the heads of state in one place and deliver the ultimatum to all at the same time. Informed that under the circumstances of mistrust (cold war) that it would be impossible, Klaatu decides not to destroy the Earth until he has had time to walk among earthlings. He takes a room and befriends a boy, Bobby (Billy Gray) and his mother (Neal), who's father has been killed in WWII. Despite our problems and short-comings, Klaatu sees hope for us and as an alternative to destroying the planet, contacts Prof. Barnhardt (played to a tee by Sam Jaffe) and has him invite (to Washington) scientists from all over the world to whom he will give the ultimatum for them to bring back to their leaders. Klaatu agrees to give a demonstration of the FoP's power and neutralizes all electric power around the world at noon for a half hour. The demonstration also creates panic in the public and the military who eventually tracks down Klaatu and shoots him (typical, eh?). Before he dies Klaatu tells Helen she must get to the spaceship and 'deactivate' Gort's programming before the robot begins wholesale destruction of the Earth because Klaatu has been killed. She must repeat the famous words ""Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!"". Helen does this in the nick-of-time: the earth is saved; Gort retrieves Klaatu's body and brings him back to life inside the spaceship; Klaatu gives his speech to the scientists; Klaatu says good-by to Helen and takes off.

If you are looking for a lot of violence and mayhem, you won't find it here. This was a thinking person's film, with violence confined to some military hardware vaporized in the beginning and of course the shooting of Klaatu near the end. Use of score combined with light and shadow provides the suspense. Made in 1951 as the 'cold war' was heating up and nuclear testing was rampant by the USSR and the USA, this movie was a plea for peace and wiser minds to prevail.",1130716800,3,2562,4.742152466367713

442952,4,6302168465,"In director Robert Wise's science-fiction classic, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951, Fox), scripted by Edmund H. North (PATTON), a large spaceship lands in a Washington, D.C. park.  A man (Michael Rennie) who looks like a giant robot gets out and walks toward a fleeing crowd.  The National Guard's solution is, typically, to shoot off one of the stranger's hands.  But a young boy named Bobby (Billy Gray) believes him to be an alien and befriends him.  The alien, without his spacesuit, is an ordinary looking man whose name I forget.  And he spends a lot of time wandering all over the city, studying people everywhere.  There is a memorable scene at the Lincoln Memorial where he tells Bobby, ""Now there is a man I would like to converse with.""

DAY was decades-ahead of its time with its message from the sympathetic alien that we have to ban nuclear weapons from our planet, or face total annihilation.  This was very timely and controversial material only six years after the atom bombs were dropped on Japan in 1945.  Nuclear testing was going on in the Nevada desert.  Maybe this helps explain why the movie got no Oscar nominations in a weak movie year, but is now a cult classic.

Bobby's mother Helen (Patricia Neal) slowly realizes that her son's new friend is the alien and grows to like him also--he is nice to her son, maybe because Bobby is obviously not old enough to side with the federal government's stupid plan to want to kill the alien-and a second alien--before they have interrogated him to find out what he and the second alien want.  One thing is for sure; he is a wiz at math.  He helps scientist Sam Jaffe with higher math calculations that have stymied Jaffe!

The movie was largely filmed on location to give it a realistic feel; even the rear projections are way above average (a grown Billy Gray says on a DVD supplement that he never went to Washington, D.C.  That was second-unit work.) Cinematographer Leo Tover uses nighttime B&W to create a film noir landscape with just ordinary tree-lined streets with menacing shadows and apartments close together.  And he photographs interiors and daytime shots in interesting ways. And Bernard Herrmann's eerie theramin score adds immeasurably to the film's frightening subtext and mood.  DAY was also released the year I was born, 1951, and I am always interested in seeing what America looked like back then, especially on-location exteriors and home interiors.

THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is one of the priced-to-sell Fox Studio Classics DVD's with an amazing number of bonuses for only $15 or less because, ironically, it is ""an old movie, not a modern new release""!  Bonuses here include an audio commentary with Robert Wise and Nicholas Meyer, a comprehensive 70 minute filmmaking documentary, a Movietone newsreel, restoration comparison, and photo galleries.  The movie runs 92 minutes and is in luminous B&W.",1127001600,6,2900,4.867617107942974

Even today, with films of this genre having advanced to their present visual levels, lives on as a quintessential hallmark in movie history.  Actually, even the visual effects, which another reviewer characterized as not particularly impressive, are excellent.  The opening 5 minute sequence of the space craft coming down to land on the Wash DC Mall, is truly wonderful.....Extremely impressive in those days, due to its life-like rendition of flight and visual continuity .... without the ""herky-jerky"" quality of pre-matting technology of the day.  However, NOT sensationalized either ... just part of the story.  The film evolves into a finely crafted and balanced STORY ..... well presented, and mature... and an excellent cast (albeit Michael Renne's otherworldly ""British"" accent ... !!

442994,5,6302168465,"""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is arguably the most religious science fiction film ever made. It is hard to miss the religious symbolism of Klaatu (Michael Rennie), the strange visitor from another planet, who explores the neighborhood under the name of ""Carpenter,"" especially when he is killed and resurrected by his robot companion Gort (Lock Morton). The parallels between Klaatu and Christ continue as the alien brings a message for all of the people of earth that the people of earth are not all that interested in hearing. It seems that now that Earth is developing atomic power, the other inhabited planets of the galaxy are concerned that the new kids on the block are not mature enough to avoid destroying everything.

I remember Michael Rennie from ""Lost in Space,"" where he played ""The Keeper,"" and he brings the same sort of strong, dignity to the role of Klaatu. The alien might be here to lecture the Earth people, but he sounds so reasonable in his condemnation. Besides, how can you disagree with his reasoning? Patricia Neal as Helen Benson is the calmest and most rationale female lead every seen in a science fiction film, black & white from the Fifties or any other type. Helen accepts the reality of the rather remarkable situation she and her son Bobby (Billy Gray) find themselves involved in without really batting an eye. Nor does her voice tremble when she utters the greatest alien phrase in cinematic history. Sam Jaffe is equally unperturbed as Professor Jacob Barnhardt, the smartest man on Earth, who comes back from lunch and finds somebody (Klaatu) has been editing the formula on his blackboard. In contrast to these paragons of humanity is Hugh Marlowe as Tom Stevens, who has been stepping out with the widow Benson but throws all that away to be the man who captures the fugitive alien. The man is just such a schmuck.

The film is based on the Harry Bates short story ""Farewell to the Master,"" which was first published in the October 1940 issue of ""Astounding Stories."" Actually, screenwriter Edmund H. North only keeps the first part of the story, when the spaceship lands on earth, Klaatu and the robot emerge, and the humanoid is shot (check out the original story if you can track it down). Of course, in the 1950s, Hollywood was always taking great liberties with classic science fiction short stories. The other great example of this would be ""The Thing From Another World,"" based on John W. Campbell's short story ""Who Goes There?""

""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" provides one of the most unambiguous alien messages to be found in a science fiction film (cf. ""2001: A Space Odyssey""). As an extra bonus, you have Aunt Bee sharing her thoughts on aliens. This remains a classic science fiction film, a rare opportunity for the intellectualism of the genre to be given free reign on the big screen. Not my favorite Fifites sci-fi film, but certainly should be on everybody's top 10 list for the decade. However, watching the movie again this time I was struck by the fact that Robert Wise took the same sort of approach when he directed ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture.""

442997,5,6302168465,"This may be the iconic 1950s flying saucer movie. It's hard to take completely seriously now, but its basic theme still needs to be said. Jealousy and short-sightnedness aren't just defects of character, they are fatal illnesses.

The effects are modest, a few optical tricks and some tall guy in a robot suit. The people are straight out of Leave it to Beaver: men wearing hats, even indoors, women wearing fashions from that unfortunate time between 1940s style and 1960s passion, and eight year old boys who wear neckties to the playground. The alien (Klaatu, or Carpenter) is quite human-looking, too, as if every decent species would end up looking Caucasian. The movie's action is restrained, even somnolent by ""The Matrix"" standards - but it still holds the viewer's attention, and may offer somewhat rewards than most of today's chases, gunfights, and explosions. And it's in black and white, not color.

You can watch this movie as a laughable artifact of a more innocent time, good for popcorn on a rainy day, but maybe not much else. Or, you can look at it as a time capsule of the fears and hopes from the early days of the Cold War. We can no longer see it the way it was seen and meant to be seen originally. It is well worth seeing despite that, and maybe because of it.

442999,5,6302168465,"I've hesitated to review this movie primarily because I would merely be adding my voice to the chorus of kudos already here.  Still, here goes.

By every measure, this movie is a classic.  One of the few genuinely 5-star science-fiction films, it boasts superlative script, acting, direction, and production.  As for its message -- I wish today's world leaders could understand its implications.  When Klaatu is first in the hospital, he is visited by the Secretary of Something-or-Other who remarks, ""You seem impatient.""  Klaatu's comeback:  ""I'm impatient with stupidity.  My people have learned to live without it.""  And the Secretary responds, ""Unfortunately, my people have not.""  Fifty years later, that aspect of humanity hasn't changed.

The choice of Michael Rennie to play Klaatu was inspired.  Wise wanted a superb actor whose face would not be immediately recognized in the United States.  It gave Klaatu a bit more of an ""alien"" presence and added credibility to the execution of the plot.

This was a very bold movie for its time.  In 1951, the Korean War was in full swing, and a pacifist point-of-view did not sit well with the government brass.  In fact, the military refused to provide any hardware to add authenticity to the film.  All of the tanks, jeeps, and so on came from the Virginia Military Institute.

This movie also proves that you can make a first-class science-fiction film without the pyrotechnics (and the astronomical budget to support them) that characterize today's forays into the genre.  Ultimately, the story and the script (along with the acting and direction) count more than does maximizing the acreage you can blow up in two hours.  I wish there were more movies like this, but -- alas -- they are extremely hard to find.

Incidentally, the restoration of the film for this DVD is outstanding.  The package includes a documentary on the restoration and provides ""before"" and ""after"" examples.

443002,5,6302168465,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is what good Sci-Fi should be. It contains man's encounter with the unknown, and often shows the good and bad in human nature. This movie was made about 35 years before my time, but I still found it very well-made on so many levels. Michael Rennie plays the messenger from another planet, and his message is detrimental to the continued existence of the planet Earth. Man's aggresion and technological development have threatened other planets, which cannot be tolerated. Rennie is great as the visitor, as he becomes a character we sympathize with more than the people of Earth due to his peaceful nature.

Another thing good about this movie is the casting of characters. Development of these characters is what makes the story continue to flow, and ""Mr. Carpenter's"" (Rennie) interaction with the people of Earth delve into and reveal human emotion during an emergency like this where a spaceship has actually landed in Washington DC. There is not very much action in this movie, but it is excellent nonetheless. Even the soundtrack during the movie adds that eerie 50's sci-fi feel to it.

443003,4,6302168465,"I had forgotten what a great film this is. Or perhaps I was simply too young when I first saw it. Upon seeing it again, I realize it is three films in one: 1) it is a fifties SF flick; 2) it is a morality play; and 3) it is a tour de force in cinematographic technique.

As a fifties SF/Monster movie it is just adequate - a little boring is how I remembered it. It has all the obligatory clichs: the flying saucer; the menacing hulking monster robot; the death ray; the girl being stalked by the monster robot, falling down and screaming. One striking innovation is the seamless doors of the spaceship.

As a morality play it is a much finer film. A man comes to earth from somewhere in outer space (a neighboring planet we are told). His mission is to warn the people of the earth that they must mend their violent ways or suffer dire consequences. To demonstrate his powers he stops all traffic for half an hour. An ignorant public views him with fear. The authorities are jealous of his powers. Together they conspire to kill him. He is hunted down and fatally shot.  Forces unimagined on earth bring him back to life. He succeeds in completing his mission by informing the assembled scientists of the grave peril facing the earth. The scientists appear to be impressed. The spaceman departs for home.

The plot is veiled just enough so as not to offend most religious people.  The title of the film, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" refers directly to the traffic stopping incident, but also seems to have biblical allusions (Joshua?).

While overall effective, some parts of the plot appear inconsistent. Klaatu (as the space visitor is called) threatens to reduce the earth to cinders. But why is this necessary? He has demonstrated much more controlled and selective powers (such as stopping all traffic). Could he not just eliminate the violent people? Or even all humanity, but spare the animals? Also, would it be wise to give robots the unimaginable powers that Gorth (the robot) seems to have.

A character in the film, Dr. Barnhardt, is clearly meant to depict Albert Einstein. Einstein was at the height of his fame when the film was made, and had a reputation as a man of peace, as well as a great scientist. The scientist role is played with sensitivity and warmth. The real jewel of the film is the performance of Patricia Neal (playing Helen Benson, a single mother). Her facial expressions are so sweet that they rival the great Ingrid Bergman at her best. The role of Klaatu is excellently performed by Michael Rennie, who manages to portray strength and kindness at the same time.

Finally the film is masterful in its filming techniques. It is strongly reminiscent of the German impressionists, Eisenstein, and ""Citizen Kane."" The effective use of light and shadows is especially to be noted. The ominous chords of the soundtrack remind one of Prokofiev's scores for the Eisenstein films (though not of course on the same level). There are some excellent shots of Washington, DC, as it was half a century ago.",1114732800,4,3032,4.68609022556391

rooting for the alien!  What a wonderful film!!!",1114646400,3,396,4.328767123287672
443029,5,6302168465,"It's hard not to see this as anything but an A grade film. The camera  work is great. The use of light and shade is on a par  with the great work done in THE GHOST AND MRS  MUIR. And above  all, the script is a brilliant work, and a very erudite harbinger of the 1950s.
Contrary to some views, a lot happens in this film, and at no stage is Mr. "" Carpenter"" ever Resurrected... in fact, it is explictly stated in the film that this is not so. Yes, Carpenter ( Klaatu)  was close to death, but still far away from death for his technology to pull him back.
The skill in this film lies in the telling of a story, and the performance of Rennie and his supporting cast.
A brilliant film, and with a story told in magnificent form.

Reading the other reviews, I am glad to note that the vast majority like, enjoy, and celebrate the craft exhibited in this film. The very few ""looney right"" reviews are so far off the beam as to make you wonder what film they  saw. Still the one thing that is a constant in the last 2 millenia, and maybe more, is that the looney right will occasionally seize control, and they do so from a minority powerbase, usually deceiving the people who supported them for a while, until they wake up, and find that what was promised by the Looney right is not what was delivered. In this respect, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD  STILL is a reminder that hatred, bigotry, and the insanity of the looney right ( and yes, in saying this, I DO mean that there is a sane right ... as some have reminded me, do not judge the conservatives because of some morons; still, how many liberals have bombed places, killed people, and maimed them, just because they did not believe the same as they did).

Anyways, THE DAY... is a great piece of entertainment that you can analyse to death, but the fun is in watching a work of art like this magnificent piece.

enjoy.",1112572800,6,1866,4.245762711864407
443030,4,6302168465,"""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" was released in 1951.  It was based on a 1940 novelette by Harry Bates titled ""Farewell To The Master"".  While the novelette and the movie share several common elements, they are really two different stories.  The movie has a clear message of peace during a time period after World War II, and during the U.S. involvement in Korea.  The next paragraph discusses the plot of the movie, so if you want to avoid spoilers please skip it.

In the movie an alien called Klaatu (Michael Rennie) comes to Earth to deliver a warning to all the nations.  He is accompanied by an indestructible robot called Gort (Lock Martin), who takes action whenever violence is directed at Klaatu.  Klaatu tries political channels to deliver his message, but when that doesn't work he escapes into the general population to learn about Earth's people.  He then decides that the scientific community is the best way to deliver his message, and arranges for such a meeting.  The Army manages to track him down before the meeting though, and he provides Helen (Patricia Neal) with the famous command ""Klaatu Barada Nikto"" to use on Gort if he (Klaatu) should be harmed.  There is an underlying Christ story which goes through the film, and which becomes a bit more apparent at the end where Gort recovers Klaatu's body and resurrects him.

Unlike the science fiction movies of today, this is not an action movie.  The special effects in this film clearly reflect the time in which it was made, and today's audiences will probably not be impressed by them.  The strength of this movie is the story, which is still mesmerizing today.  While the 50's is certainly known as a decade when many low-budget science fiction movies were made, it really is not a fair categorization of this particular movie.

The restoration of this film is wonderful, it looks much better than when I first saw it in the late 70's.  There are also several special features, some on the other side of the DVD.  On the film side, there is an audio commentary by the Robert Wise (the director) and Nicolas Meyer; it is dry in spots, but for the most part is pretty interesting.  On the humorous side, it is clear from the commentary that Nicolas Meyer does not care for Hugh Marlowe as an actor, either in this movie or any other.  The other features on this side are a Movietone Newsreel from 1951, and the theatrical trailer for the film.

On the other side of the DVD, there is an interesting documentary called ""Making the Earth Stand Still"" which has many interviews with people involved in the making of the movie and it also has a section with fans that have collected memorabilia from the movie.  There is a restoration comparison showing the before and after, but this has been done with so many of the older films, I don't think it is of much interest.  The next special feature is the `Still Galleries' which includes production photos, scene and set photos, the shooting script, construction blue prints for the ship, the American and British pressbooks, and posters, lobby cards, the spaceship model and Gort.  Lastly, there are a couple of trailers for two other movies: ""One Million Years B.C."", and ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"".",1111708800,6,3230,4.708185053380783
443031,5,6302168465,"It must have been around the year 1962 when I was eight years old, that an  advertisement came on our TV screen for NBC's Saturday Night At the Movies. It showed a giant silver robot emerging from a picture-perfect flying saucer--the prototype for all my subsequent flying saucer dreams--which then proceeded to march menacingly down the ramp while people behind ropes scurried unnaturally away like hysterical mice. An insane, terrifying music from another world strained and soared while quietly , effortlessly the creature raised a silver visor, where eyes would have been, revealing a wavering, liquid light which hesitated, and then shot beam after beam reducing to ash  rifles ,artillery and a tank. A benign, wounded space man with a few words restrained him and we could once again take another breath.

I was forever changed from this moment and never,never saw the world the same again. What was this power that held all the authority that I saw and trusted at such a standstill? What creatures were these that commanded such awe,fear and respect and could they ever again be forgotton? As the years passed and I went about the usual rounds of school and childish enthusiasms I could never quite relenquish the power those images had on me and I find even today that the look-Gort with his unvanquished authority-Klaatu with his quiet yet menacing message-the sound--Bernard Hermann's

eerie, truly unearthly score--still have a hold, an emotional power that I feel to the depth of my bones.

I truly Love this film-it is the only framed Movie Poster I have in my house--and seeing it or hearing the music--I bought the score--tranports me back to that beautiful, paranoid, military loving black-and-white sublimeness known as the 1950's.

443032,5,6302168465,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is more than a movie.  It is a  universal message for peace and an allegory about our planet's situation. It was based on the book, ""When Kings Go Forth"".  The movie was released in 1950, right at the time of the Korean War and cold war tensions were high around the world.  Both the Soviet Union and the United States had the atomic bomb. Great director Robert Wise directed this movie in black and white.  Basically the story starts out with a spacecraft flying down to Earth, specifically Washington D.C. in a baseball park.  A humanoid alien named Klaatu played by a tall, handsome Michael Rennie leaves the spacecraft and attempts to peacefully communicate with humans but is met with violence by a frightened human race.  Klaatu is shot and wounded.  Gort, his giant (8 foot tall) robot retaliates and destroys several pieces of Army armor. He is taken to a hospital, ""secured"" and escapes after trying to convince the American authorities that he has come to Earth from an organization of planets from deep space to give a message to Earth.  Klaatu takes refuge incognito in Washington under an assumed name and befriends a war widow, Mrs. Benson played by the beautiful and talented Patricia Neal and her son played by Bobby Benson at a boarding house. Klaatu's mission is to get his very important message to Earth but he cannot give his message individually but conglomerately, to world leaders preferably.  He does meet with a Dr. Barnhart played by the excellent actor Sam Jaffe and Einstein look-alike, one of the world's greatest scientist's whose home is in Washington D.C.  Through Dr. Barnhart's suggestion, a demonstration is requested of Klaatu that would dramatize the seriousness of the situation, a demonstration of the visitor's powers that would be of a nonviolent nature and cause the political as well as scientific leaders to meet with Klaatu.  The rest of the movie reveals Klaatu's ingeniousness, peril by Earthmen, the eventual understanding relationship between Mrs. Benson (Neal) and Klaatu (Rennie).  The movie will reveal Klaatu's message and what alternative is offered to humankind.  See if you can determine  what this message by Klaatu means and how does it pertain to saving Earth?  What age is Klaatu?  What does Klaatu teach Dr. Barnhart?  You won't be disappointed watching this movie. I have it in my personal collection!",1110499200,4,2394,4.957393483709273

443034,5,6302168465,"Probably the most intelligent and thought provoking sci-fi movie ever made.  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is probably the primer  and set the tone for such television shows as THE TWILIGHT ZONE and even STAR TREK a few years later.  The title of the film itself stands for a segment during the film. An alien from another world demonstrates his advanced technology of his alien civilization by turning off all power and machines around the world for an hour thus frightening the world population. This plot device was lifted somewhat for the classic TWILIGHT ZONE episode ""The Monsters are Due on Maple Street"". Michael Rennie as Klaatu (aka Mr. Carpenter) gives a caring and compassionate performance as the Christ-like metaphor alien. He is sent to Earth to warn the leaders that they are being observed and that their current behavior can lead to their future anhilation. Earth, with its uncoopperative nations and in the dawn of its nuclear age can be a threat to a certain interstallar alien alliance whose main goal is peace and stability in the universe. The film has its stereotypical military paranoia baffoonishness that's played just right and has the classic alien robot(Gort)and spacecraft/flying saucer. However, the real treat is Klaatu's relationship with the boy Bobby Benson (Billy Gray from tv's FATHER KNOWS BEST) he befriends while escaping military incarceration and ends up in a boarding house to live among human beings. The tour they take to Arlington Cemetary and the Lincoln Memorial are great scenes which leads to a meeting with a celabrated Einstein-like scientist Dr. Barnhardt played by Sam Jaffe. The ""formula-on-the-blackboard"" segment in the film was another intelligent plot device.  Overall, a classic piece of science fiction with a great script, great cast, excellent characters, just the right amount of special effects for its day, and a timeless anti-war/anti-nuclear theme.",1107993600,4,1917,5.214285714285714

Holy Cow! Have I ever been missing out!?! This film is so poignant for the conditions of today's society that it's hardly noticeable as a classic movie.  The topic transcends the Sci-Fi genre and digs right into the crux of the modern, technological, human nuclear experience. Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal give extraordinary performances that break down the Human/Alien barriers in a way that makes evident the overall message of the individual's responsibility for universal, peaceful, coexistence. Moreover, it is a stunning reminder of the technological monster we have become used to sleeping with, and think about less and less: Nuclear Weapons.

The film stars Michael Rennie as the alien Klaatu, who comes to Earth with the message that its people must change our violent ways, or else our planet will be destroyed.  He is shot as soon as he steps foot on the planet, and then treated badly by the government.  He escapes from the hospital where he is imprisoned and befriends a widow (Patricia Neal) and her son (Billy Gray).  Ignoring the hostility of Earth's people, Klaatu continuosly tries to find a way to give us peace.

""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" won a Golden Globe for ""Best Film Promoting International Understanding"".  The greatest part of the film, and the biggest reason that it is respected, is that it only uses the aliens and science-fiction as the plot.  The movie's message is about peace, and it states that message loud and clear throughout the film.

The cast is great, especially Rennie as Klaatu - and who could forget Klaatu's assistant, the towering robot Gort, played by 7'7"" Lock Martin?  There's also a terrific score by Bernard Herrmann.

This is a film that I would recommend to anyone.  While it is, truly, a very good, intelligent sci-fi classic, I'd have to say it is a little overrated.",1104969600,,1441,4.517374517374518
443076,5,6302168465,"This may have been the first truly great scifi that I saw as a child.  I recall that it was puzzling to me - how an alien cd actually be a ""good guy"" even as he threatened Earth.  Well, having bought this in DVD, I can say that this is a fascinating and subtle film, in which the power of man is questioned by a being from a superior civilization.  He comes to Earth with a message, and is confronted by the realities of the Cold War - fear, the will to violence, the parochial arrogance of the local pols, and closed minds.  Somehow, he manages to investigate Earth and establish relationships, which may - and only MAY - lead to the salvation of a troubled planet.  There are great and simple special effects as well as an austerity of style that perfectly matches the story.

Maybe I am a sap, but I found it a deeply moving experience to watch this magic film, which totally enveloped me in its mood and message.  This is firt rate hard scifi, which is not easy to find in film.  There are also some very good characters, such as the lonely young widow and the man she is dating, about whom she learns many disturbing things.

443078,4,6302168465,"This is not the definitive Cold War Science Fiction movie- that honor would go to Invasion of the Body Snatchers- however, this is a far more intelligent and objective (and perhaps better) film.

Alien Klaatu lands on earth and is immediatly subject to suspision.  He goes incognito as ""Mr. Carpenter"" and decides people are worth saving.  The special effects are decent (aside from when Patricia Neal is picked up by Gort) and the acting generally decent.  However, these are not what make the film stand out.

Most Cold-war films use thinly veiled jabs at communists and their nefarious intentions (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) or are very anti-scientist (The Thing from Another World) because they're a convienent group to blame for the Cold War.  Of course no one was blaming them when they saved thousands of American lives by stopping an invasion of the Japanese mainland,  but hey, people are hypocrites.  This film uses neither attack, and is all the better for it.

When alien Klaatu lands on earth, it is a twitchy US soldier who shoots him in the arm and it is a Washington emissary who informs Klaatu of their failure to bring representatives of every nation in the world togethor.  It is the vacuous housewife who insinuates that the alien is a communist and the man, not the woman, who does something stupid to jeapardize the alien's mission.  Black people are shown standing in a crowd with white people, and the scientists are portrayed as intelligent and truth-seeking, not misanthropic.

I say these things to heap praise on the movie: it is clearly ahead of its time.  It casts aside prejudice and bigotry to get its pacifistic message across.  The question at the end is not whether the United States can prevent a communist invasion, but whether the world powers can prevent destroying the world.

This is thought-provoking science fiction at its finest.  It is also an extremely entertaining film.  True sci-fi aficionados would be remiss in their studies if they have overlooked this one.  It is comparable to an art history major that has never seen nor heard of the ""Mona Lisa"".

WHO sHOULD AVOID:

If your sci-fi tastes lean towards ""it got blowed up real good"" type entertainment like ""Independence Day"", then this is not your picture.  It is in boring black and white not shiny, distracting color and moves at a slow, steady pace building tension through tedious, attention-demanding elements such as character development, subtlety, fully realized dramatic situations and higher philosophic ideals.  It is a film designed to make you think.  It is the cinematic equivalent of being forced to read a book.  If you have ever been ""forced"" to read a book, stay away from this film.  It will only stimulate your under-used cerebral cortex and give you a headache.

He could destroy the earth!  But he doesn't.  Instead he melts some tanks and rifles..oh an he head butts to army guys or so we think cause the shot cuts away to the frightened Billy.  The film score by Bernard Hermann is so fantastic.  The Theramen really makes it special.  The film is so simple and that is why i love it.  It's a simple story with a simple message that is still as powerful as it was back in nineteen dickity one.  I would be the happiest filmmaker on earth if I could make such a classic science fiction film such as this.  Brilliance.  One of my all time favorites.

443081,4,6302168465,"I have to confess, up until I watched this DVD, my total appreciation of The Day the Earth Stood Still  consisted of my mom's idealistic teenage  Can't we all just get along?  memories of it, and the fact that the film and its star, Michael Rennie, made it into a line of the Rocky Horror theme song. (You remember, he told us where to stand, On our feet!). I didn't expect to get all that much out of it, but kept hearing my movie buff friends tout it as THE sci-fi classic of the early fifties. Well. Writer Nicolas Mayer, useful idiot though he may have been (Russia was trying to bring peace to the world, - he says in an accompanying documentary, referring to the time when Stalin was eating Ukrainians for breakfast, artists like Mayer for dinner, and throwing the leftovers in the Gulag, -and [the West] kept building bombs.), created a screenplay that transcended the political times. He says he employed a subtle Christ theme that he didn't expect anyone to notice. I noticed. It's precious.

 A guy from beyond our world, who takes on the name Carpenter,  and shows up in human form, comes to warn us that if all of us don't stop fighting....if we all don't learn to love each other that is... terrible destruction will befall us. But this message isn't for the select few who are full of self- importance. He insists the message is for everyone, although constantly he faces powers that try to stop him. Kids love him. He doesn't care very much about money. Sound familiar? I could go on, but reviews like that are called Spoilers.

 The direction and acting are superb. Shadow and light and camera direction are well-used to show how different the stranger seems to the others in the film, even though he looks like an ordinary human being to the viewer. The choice of an unknown was a brilliant means to ensure the interplanetary visitor was a stranger...unfortunately for Mr. Rennie, his career did so poorly he's a stranger for us, too. There are a few faux pas in scenery during a scene with Ms. Neal and the robot that could have been edited more carefully, hence the subtracted star.

443143,4,6302168465,"Some have interpreted this movie as a metaphor for big brother, or communisim. However there are also those that adhere to this movie symbolizing the life, appearence, crucifixtion and resurrection of Christ. Some clues seem obvious such as the alien adopting the name ""Carpenter"" and bringing a ""gift"" to mankind and also able to escape the hospital room without notice. But there are some clues that are a bit more hidden. Watch closely as Carpenter is shot in the street and his pose as he lays dying. I think the ""cross"" type posture is undeniable.

 And in response to the reviewer from Park Ridge Illinois describing the ""botched scene"" with scratches that appear on the screen when Gort picks up Patricia Neal. It actually is what it appears to be and that is strings attached to Patricia Neal's body. The print is so good it even reveals the ""special"" effects. The actor that played Gort was not very strong and the only way to make it appear as if Gort is carrying her was to attach strings to her for support. A rather embarrassing scene which is obscured in less sharp VHS prints. Although it seems laughable, I don't think it takes away substantially from the overall impact of the movie. Though I do agree that it could have been done better with the right lighting and shadows.

 1950's era sci-fi is filled with such faux paux's, but that is part of their charm too. I guess in 20 years the current sci-fi like Matrix and the fantasy movies such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter will be derided in the same way. Nevertheless I would prefer to watch most of the 50's era sci-fi than most of what is foisted upon the public today. In many cases the CGI seems to be the centerpiece of the movie and the creativity, character development and script appear to be thrown together at the last moment.

443145,5,6302168465,"Where does one begin with such a classic film.  The Day the Earth Stood Still is the definition of classic.  Above average for its genre, the movie still hold its own even today.
Robert Wise did a masterful job directing the picture.  Given the fact that he was directing a new and somewhat unknown lead actor in Michael Rennie, Wise did a superb job.  Could anyone else have played Clatu other than Rennie?
The premise of the story, a visitation from another planetary system to warn us off our reckless advancement into the nuclear age is very timely even in 2004.  Clatu, the alien traveler, needs to discuss the ramifications of our behavior with every nation on Earth but learns that such a meeting is impossible given the petty international squabbling and mistrust of the day. Clatu escapes his captivity in the hospital and moves around disguised as a Maj. Carpenter.  He meets Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her son Bobby (Bill Gray) and learns about many of our human foibles.  Also involved is Hugh Marlow's character, Helen Bensons male companion.  Sam Jaffe is wonderful as Prof. Barnhardt.
Eventually, Clatu is shot (a second time) and killed.  Gort, the robot, with the intervention of Helen revives Clatu and in a final climatic scene Clatu delivers his message.  This is a marvelous film even after 53 years.
The DVD is also well worth the small investment.  I purchased my copy at a discount store for $5.50....I should be arrested. I agree with an earlier reviewer that the number of extras devoted to this old film is remarkable.
If you get the chance grab this DVD.  Even after all these years the movie is fresh and certainly timely.  Also, a final observation.  Given the paranoia in most modern movies dealing with aliens, The Day the Earth Stood Still is another perspective on the topic of alien visitations.  Its amazing how perverted the whole genre has become.  This is certainly a reflection of society as a whole.",1090195200,3,1946,4.781437125748503
443146,5,6302168465,"I first saw this film in the mid 50s. It was excellent then and it remains so today. The effects are quaint, much of the action is completely implausable, but nonetheless the whole thing is effective. Seeing a cross-section of 50s life was interesting, too - nary an impolite or overweight person seems to have existed.
Michael Rennie has come here to warn us that his race's robots have the ability to destroy the Earth, and will do so unless we soon mend our aggressive ways. Of course, the root question - who gets to determine issues of aggression - is never touched on, but the film, at its simplified level, works as a morality play. We really should be nice to each other.
Machines as world policemen is exactly the concept behind SkyNet of the Terminator series. The main difference between the two plots is that Terminator has a more jaded - I would say realistic - view of the limits of technology, in that the machines have gone awry and the humans are forced to fight them for survival. ""Earth"" antiwar message is also  more politically correct, and its DVD's extras confirm that with their front and center faith in globalism.
It's interesting to imagine a sequel to ""Earth"", reflecting what we now know about the limits of technology: Michael Rennie, call home; the robots have taken over. Rennie thus has to come back to Earth to enlist OUR help in destroying the robots. He and Patricia Neal, of course, fall in love. The boy will grow up to lead the resistance. But I digress...
""Earth""'s shortcomings are forgiven. The movie works so well at its level and its message is so well-intentioned that it's hard to find fault. Rennie, Neal, the boy, the beau, all turn in great performances.
The genre has come a long way, baby, but it's good to revisit roots now and again. A classic.",1087171200,3,1797,4.598130841121495

I'm not sure of the exact day but the month and year was September 1951 when this somewhat serious sci-fi classic was released into theatres.  As a brief synopsis, this ninety-minute, black-and-white movie begins with a spaceship landing in Washington, DC, capturing the world's attention.  The human-like extraterrestrial named ""Klaatu"" (pronounced ""Claa-two"") onboard is detained by the military authorities and refuses to reveal the purpose of his mission to any single government.  His very tall and very powerful mute robot named ""Gort"" guards the spaceship while Klaatu is detained.  Eventually, Klaatu escapes the authorities and he (who takes the name ""Carpenter"") walks among Earthlings, befriending a young mother ""Helen Benson"" and her twelve-year old son ""Bobby.""  He even makes contact with an eminent professor of science named ""Jacob Barnhartd"" (pronounced ""Barn-hard"") and demonstrates (in a ""dramatic but not destructive"" way) to this scientist and the world the immense power he has at his command.  The authorities get very nervous because of this and a ""spaceman-hunt"" ensues which eventually turns violent.  By the end of the movie, Klaatu gives the human race a warning and an ultimatum.

This synopsis does not convey the numerous strengths of this movie, some of which are as follows:

(1) Acting. This is what makes the movie.  Michael Rennie as Klaatu is perfect as the peaceful and intelligent extraterrestrial and Lock Martin as Gort helps add mysteriousness to the movie as Klaatu's robotic sidekick.  Patricia Neal as Helen Benson plays a believable and strong heroine who along with her inquisitive son Bobby (Billy Gray) befriend Klaatu who poses as Mr. Carpenter.  As well, Sam Jaffe as Professor Barnhartd gives a brilliant portrayal of the Einstein-like scientist who also befriends Klaatu and acts as a voice of reason for the human race.

(2) Cinematography.  It adds to each scene of the movie.  This movie is like a ""time capsule"" giving the viewer a glimpse of 1950's America.

(3) Musical score.  Also adds to each scene of the movie.  In fact, the music was so good, that it eventually became the standard music of future sci-fi films.

Here are some things to look for when watching this movie:

(1) Klaatu's first and last words.  Klaatu's first words at the beginning of the movie are, ""We have come to visit you in peace and with good will.""  By the end of the movie, Klaatu gives an interesting speech, the last lines of which are the following: ""Your choice is simple: join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration...The decision rests with you.""

(2) Klaatu's ""resurrection.""  Near the end of the movie Klaatu, as Carpenter, dies and is brought back to life by Gort.

(3) Memorable lines especially those giving social commentary.  This movie is filled with unforgettable lines.  For example, Klaatu as Mr. Carpenter tells Bobby that he comes from a place where there are no wars.  The twelve-year old says, ""Gee, that's a good idea.""  Professor Barnhartd says, ""Faith doesn't make good science -- curiosity does.""  And the famous words uttered by Helen Benson to Gort have become well-known to sci-fi buffs: ""Klaatu barada nikto"" (pronounced ""Claa-two, ba-ra-da, nick-two"").  Be sure to listen for some humorous lines.  For example, ""They're not people.  They're Democrats.""

When watching this movie, remember that you're watching a movie made in the 1950s that was shot on a budget.  As a result, special effects are minimal (but still good) and the story depends more on character development and imagination.  Also, you might ask yourself some questions.  For example, why are only two soldiers guarding a spaceship that has a tall robot standing in front of it?  You'll also find that everybody in this movie is extremely well-mannered.  For example, all of the adults most of the time call themselves ""Mr."" or ""Mrs.""

The DVD extras are magnificent.  They enhance the enjoyment of the movie.

Finally, one problem for some people is that the movie on the DVD was not in widescreen format.  For me, this was not a problem.

In conclusion, be sure not to miss this well-acted sci-fi classic that has such a powerful message that it won the Golden Globe for Best Film Promoting International Understanding!!

443148,5,6302168465,"With no major stars, Robert Wise's film is as timely and relevant today as it was when it premiered in 1951.  The literate script, the crisp B & W cinematography, the wondrous Washington locations, an influential Bernard Herrmann and an outstanding cast combine to make this a masterpiece of the cinema.
Michael Rennie is flawless as the alien on a mission to a planet in deep internal chaos: the EARTH. Pre-Oscar winner Patricia Neal plays a non-stereotypical female lead: she is strong and does not cringe in the face of danger, never becoming a ""screaming Mimi.""  Frizzy-haired Sam Jaffe again assays a role that he practically patented: the all-knowing scientist. Young Billy Gray, later to be one of Robert Young's ""Father Knows Best"" brood, is believable as a kid fascinated by ""Mr. Carpenter"".  And Fox contract player Hugh Marlowe (he was one of the cast of the classic ""All About Eve"") does well as Neal's despicable cad of a boyfriend.  Even Frances Bavier (""Aunt Bee"" of ""The Andy Griffith Show"") has a small role.
Director Wise also populated his crowd scenes with African-Americans and other minorities, certainly a true reflection of America than most films of the era.  For that, he can be considered a visionary in more ways than one.
Also, the use of then-popular radio personalities as Drew Pearson and H.V. Kaltenborn adds an air of authenticity to the science fiction trappings of the storyline.

The premise of this story is simple enough and perhaps even predictable, yet it has the elements of a great fable that can be retold over and over.  This anniversary edition is excellent, the images are sharp and the spooky black and white contrasts are presented crisp and clear.  The sound is superb.  The special features only enhance the overall package. Highly recommended. The price is right and if you miss out on this one you will regret it.",1082419200,2,555,4.445544554455446

Michael Rennie's performance and demeanor are superb; along with the threat of his invincible robot and the portrayal of America's paramoia in the face of a hostile cold-war political environment.
Don't waste your time with this film if you're looking for special effects - they're minimal (and the film is B/W).

443151,2,6302168465,"Unlike many xenophobic American sci-fi movies of the era, this film refuses to cast the Other as a straight villain or menace and dares to present us his own point of view. At the same time, though, humanizing the hero considerably lessens the film's impact: local people are often portrayed critically, but since the stranger is a sort of 'superman' himself, that criticism loses most of its force. Thus, while 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' might initially seem like the exact opposite of xenophobic sci-fi pictures, its shortcomings are in fact very similar. In many ways, the film emphasizes the limitations of A-cinema in regard to 1950s American sci-fi: the topic is approached nationally (the entire U.S. seems to be involved), messages are explicitely stated, showing is generally more important than evocating; whereas true B-films can be more intimate, nuanced and subversive. As a case in point, a film like E. Ulmer's 'The Man From Planet X', made the same year on a much smaller budget, arguably has more to say on the subject - its treatment of the man/Other relationship is less explicit but more subtle and troubling, and that film is also more mysterious and beautiful from an aesthetic standpoint, Ulmer's deliberately 'unreal' images being more expressive than Wise's nice but conventional compositions. 'The Day...' should still be seen for some of its better scenes and its earnest criticism of xenophobia.",1081036800,7,1428,5.1068376068376065
443152,5,6302168465,"This is the dvd treatment deserved by this sci-fi classic!  The film still holds up, the print looks great, the sound track is crisp and the extras are spectacular.

If you remember this film from days gone by, or if you are curious to see this classic, you can't go wrong here.

Michael Rennie, in his film debut, is perfect as Klaatu, the visitor from another planet who arrives to warn humans against their violent ways. Patricia Neal and Billy Gray as her son befriend Klaatu without knowing who he is, and scientist Sam Jaffe, looking every bit like Einstein, converses with the stranger before the final showdown outside the spaceship.

In addition to this great film, you'll see and hear some wonderful dvd extras on this double-sided disk, including: a commentary track with Nicholas Meyer (Time After Time, The Day After) interviewing director Robert Wise (Sound of Music, editor on Citizen Kane) as they watch the film; a 1951 newsreel which includes a science fiction convention award for the film; trailers for Journey to the Center of the Earth and One Million Years B.C.; hundreds of stills; complete blueprints for the spaceship; a complete shooting script; American and British press books (marketing items); a restoration comparison including scenes from the 1995 film transfer, the 1993 laser disc master and the 2002 film restoration; a featurette about film collectibles; and a terrific making-of featurette, with interesting and fun comments from stars Patricia Neal and Billy Gray (later in Father Knows Best), director Wise and producer Julian Blaustein (80 min).

For admirers of Bernard Herrmann, the features include lots of anecdotes and information about this great composer, who went for lots of atmosphere in a score using two theremins, brass, harps, electric bass and guitar, a vibraphone and backward tracks.  Herrmann composed some of Hollywood's most iconic scores (Vertigo, Psycho, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Fahrenheit 451) and it's fun to learn more about him.

I loved this film when I was a kid, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it again and learning so much about it. While all the extras were great, I especially enjoyed the commentary track. Wise addresses the Christ-story parallels in the film, the movie's anti-nuke theme, and gives us lots of fun info. For instance, we learn that Darryl Zanuck wanted Spencer Tracy to play Klaatu(!); that Gort was played by the doorman at Grauman's Chinese Theatre (the tallest man they could find), and was actually rather frail, so he could only stay in the Gort suit for 20 minutes at a time; and that there were actually two Gort outfits -- one with a zipper on the front and one with a zipper on the back, depending on where the camera was situated.

Great fun!",1078790400,4,2758,4.954545454545454
443193,4,6302168465,"While its anti-war sentiments border on preachy, The Day the Earth Stood Still is, nonetheless, an excellent film and one of the first science fiction films designed for the thinking person.
Michael Rennie is well-cast in the role of Klaato, an alien who carries with him both a message of hope and a warning to the people of the Earth.  The military, as usual, is portrayed in a somewhat unfavorable light (trigger-happy).  Patricia Neal plays the mother of a boy that Klaato befriends.
I think one of the reasons this movie works so well is the stark black and white photography employed by Robert Wise (who went on to direct Andromeda Strain, among other films).  The special effects are very good for the period, although Gort looks, and at times, moves, like an early version of the Michelin Man, or even Barney.  The soundtrack is effectively eerie--and most certainly identified with the genre.
Overall, the movie is deservedly a classic.  Although it has its faults, it most assuredly is a standard bearer amongst science fiction fans.",1076716800,4,1043,4.903409090909091

And the ""stop the violence in the world"" philosophy is just ignorant. There will always be evil people in this world. Only God can be the ultimate judge. I felt like rooting for the military after awhile. If people won't listen to there creator why would we listen to Klaatu.",1074988800,6,572,4.355140186915888

443196,4,6302168465,"""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is a nifty little science fiction film from 1951, low-budget and starkly designed, that I'm sure was not meant to be anything major when released, but has since become to be considered one of the greatest of its genre.
Directed with a spare, documentary-like style by Robert Wise (who would go on to direct such major motion pictures as ""The Sound of Music"" and ""West Side Story""), the film tells the story of a lone visitor (with his robot Gort) to Earth, who comes to warn the inhabitants of this planet against the irresponsible use of atomic power. This movie should be required viewing today, especially by members of our own government, as U.S. policy seems to be shifting ever more toward doing whatever the hell we want and the effects of our actions on world relations be damned.  Sadly, the earthlings in the film behave all too predictably (and realistically), instantly assuming the visitors have come to inflict harm and dealing with the situation through excessive military force.  Sound familiar?
It's a quick 90-minute film that smartly keeps its plot basic; it knows not to overstretch its modest bounds.  Michael Rennie is appropriately otherworldly as Klaatu, the humanoid alien, and Patricia Neal appears in an early role as one of the only level-headed people in Washington D.C.
A terrific and thoughtful movie.
Trivia: Patricia Neal's character is instructed late in the film to say the words ""Klaatu, Barada, Nikto"" to Gort to prevent him from going on a destructive rampage.  George Lucas borrowed these three words and gave them as names to three of Jabba the Hutt's henchman in ""Return of the Jedi.""  A case of one sci-fi film offering homage to another.
Grade: A-",1074729600,2,1722,4.883561643835616
443197,5,6302168465,"In fact the only thing that really stayed still in this movie was the robot. He ended up moving in the end though. Much attention has been called to this movie's message. Human beings are paranoid, easily scared, and very very violent. This is all true. To a visitor from outer space, earthlings would look pretty foolish indeed. Of course an alien that sells two diamonds to an eight year old boy for two dollars can't be that bright either.
There are however many things to learn in this movie. One is that Aunt Bea only has one dress and hair style. As a matter of fact for her part in the movie, she probably walked right off the Mayberry set, did her parts, and went right back again.
Also, for you Marilyn Monroe fans, you will see actors from her early movies. Check out the little weakling dude who smokes cigarettes through the little holder. You will recognize him as the desk clerk of the McKinley hotel in 'Don't Bother to Knock'. How about the jilted boyfriend who finally calls the army to nab our alien friend? Surely you'll recognize him from Marilyn Monroe's 'As Young as you Feel'. The most obvious though is the professor. Who wouldn't immediately recognize him as 'Herr Doctor' in the great Marilyn film 'The Asphault Jungle?'. Of course none of this should be surprising since it was a 20th Century Fox release.
Some questions do abound in this movie though that are left to be answered. A spaceship that lands in Washington D.C. and has a robot that can destroy weapons at will is guarded by only two soldiers with an alien on the loose? The alien can escape from a heavily guarded hospital room, but cannot escape in the dark while running out of a taxi? What Big & Tall store did he go to to buy his suit. I mean c'mon that was one long lanky dude. Did he go to the store in a hospital gown?
The moral of this movie is as timeless as ever. People are too stupid to rule themselves. So when we are offered a race of Killer Police Robots, we should take advantage of the opportunity. Hey the aliens don't have all the answers, but they live in peace. I think Marilyn Monroe should have been the leading lady now that I think about it.

443199,5,6302168465,"If you are into the sci-fi genre at all (and even if you are not) this is positively  a ""must see"" film. Dispite the dated special effects, B&W 50's ""look"" and ""staged"" acting, this is a true classic. It is also prophetic, important, and has major spiritual undertones.
Young people should see this film, as it has no gratuitous violence or nookie scenes, and has many memorable (and oft quoted) scenes. It also is a reflection of the time that many now-adults lived, when the threat of worldwide annihilation by nuclear war was actually very real.
The plot is simple: a space ship lands in DC, and its captain tells ""The Earth"" to get its ""stuff"" together, ""or else"" (and then proceeds with a demonstration of ""or else"", i.e. the earth stood still).
My favorite scene is when the spaceship commander visits the (empty) office of a famous scientist (leaving a ""calling card"" by solving a complex space travel equation that was left on a blackboard) and then later confronts the scientist and is asked if the solution is accurate (and responds that it ""good enough to get from one planet to another"" - or words to that effect).
The DVD version is well worth owning, as it is ""crisper"" than VHS.
Next to ""2001"", ""Blade Runner"", and ""Star Wars"", this is without-a-doubt one of the landmark sci-fi films (I leave out Alien(s), as it is actually a ""cowboys and indians/horror film"" that takes place in outer space......but is also spectacular).
In the grand scheme of all mainstream film ever made, I would rank this film in the top several dozen. It's that good.
This film lingers in your mind, and makes you wonder if (when?) ""people"" from outer space actually visit us, what would REALLY happen?
BTW, this film has huge potential for an updated re-make, but probably would suffer from over zealous special effects, and thus is no doubt better left as is.",1072051200,5,1852,4.6984615384615385
443200,5,6302168465,"There are a handful of 'classic' SF movies that really demonstrate why this genre has appealed to intelligent lay audiences for so long. It's not the cheesy special effects and it's not _just_ the coolness of making contact with extraterrestrial cultures.
The best of these films -- like the low-budget and sometimes horrid original _Star Trek_ that they spawned -- succeed in using the genre and the medium to present the cinematic equivalent of a morality play. And if some of them, like this one, come across as a bit heavy-handed today, it's because they have fewer cliches to overcome now.
_The Day the Earth Stood Still_ is still, even today, head and shoulders above its rivals. See, in 1951, yer typical SF-alien movie was something more along the lines of _Independence Day_: humans good, aliens bad, and the object of the 'plot' is just to defend the earth against the nasty invaders. This film turned that cliche on its head.
The hero here is the humanoid alien Klaatu, played brilliantly by Michael Rennie with a fine-tuned combination of icy calm and easygoing reasonableness. Klaatu has a message for the people (and peoples) of earth, and he won't deliver it to any single nation or culture; he wants representatives of all nations to get together and listen to him, and rather than approach them through their governments, he decides to work through a physicist.
His message is essentially one of peace but he isn't messing around either. This is not a sweetness-and-light movie.
The special effects are cheesy as heck, of course. In general, the movie is just crying for a remake -- in part because its theme and message are just as timely now as they were in 1951.
But if you can look past the flying saucer and the big funny robot, it's still a very, very good movie, and still miles ahead of far too many SF films even of recent vintage. (Even the original _Star Trek_ series had only a handful of episodes along the lines of 'The Devil in the Dark'.) In written SF, Heinlein's _Starship Troopers_ has received its indirect reply in Joe Haldeman's _The Forever War_ and Orson Scott Card's _Ender's Game_. But cinematic SF is still too often based on the equation 'nonhuman = evil'. And since so much of our naked-ape 'thought' is explicitly or implicitly based on the further equation 'out-group = nonhuman' -- well, you do the math.
The digital transfer on the DVD version is lovely, and there are some cool features too. But the star is the movie itself.
By the way, the famous 'Klaatu barada nikto' is never actually translated into English, so don't let anybody tell you what it 'means'.",1071964800,7,2611,4.740659340659341

443202,5,6302168465,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest films in the sci-fi pantheon, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is one of the few science-fiction flicks from the McCarthy era that is not an anti-communist allegory.  A literate and thought-provoking film, it presents extraterrestrials as humanoid in appearance and intelligent and peaceful in demeanor, as opposed to the reptilian, googly-eyed creatures with a bent for world domination that are the norm in most other Hollywood space operas of the early 1950s.
The story revolves around Klaatu (Michael Rennie), an extraterrestrial being who comes to Earth as the representative of an intergalactic peacekeeping organization.  Now that the people of Earth have reached the nuclear age, they have become a potential threat to life on other planets, and the violent history of earthlings indicates that, if left unchecked, a threat is what they will indeed become.  So Klaatu's league of interplanetary peacekeepers have sent him to offer an ultimatum: Either the Earth agrees to join the league and abide by its rules--basically, a no-nukes, no-aggression policy--or the Earth will be utterly annihilated.  And to demonstrate that he and his fellows have the power to carry through, Klaatu arranges for all non-essential electrical devices to completely cease functioning for a full 24 hours.  (The Earth stands still for an entire day--get it?)
Although there is no real evidence to support it, many contemporary fans of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL have wondered if director Robert Wise and scriptwriter Edmund North were not waxing prophetic about the global role the U.S. was, circa 1950, poised to assume.  Since WWII--and even more so after the fall of the USSR--the United States has grown to become the dominant world power both militarily and economically, and it has used this position to muscle the other nations of the world into conforming to its basic principals or, at the very least, into maintaining a non-combative relationship with its allies.  In retrospect, then, Klaatu and the organization he represents can easily be viewed as an allegory of the U.S., with the Earthlings in the film representing the other nations of the world.  And the dropping of THE BOMB on Japan can therefore be seen as the U.S.'s demonstration of power--its proof that it can, indeed, make the Earth stand still.
Prophetic allegory or not, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is a well-written and well-directed motion picture.  Wise and North's powerful storytelling techniques create concepts and images that are hard to ignore and not easy to forget. Indeed, it's likely that Klaatu and his towering robo-cop sidekick, Gort, are cinematic icons that will remain in the sci-fi lexicon long after other 20th-century film characters are considered to be grossly pass.
The DVD offers a beautiful restored version of the film; an excellent feature commentary with the film's director, Robert Wise, and renowned writer/director Nicolas Meyer (Meyer spurs Wise with pertinent questions and comments); theatrical trailers; an interesting documentary/featurette on the making of the film; a period newsreel; and more.

I love this film. It never dates. But I'm always sad to see Michael Rennie wave bye to Patricia Neal, and I still am unclear how long he survives after the spaceship exits.  Bernard Herrmann (Taxi Driver) score is classic and minimal, with early use of Theremin.",1068163200,5,591,4.94949494949495
443234,5,6302168465,"Nearly everyone who has seen THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL hails it as a classic of science fiction, even if they are not quite sure why.  For a film that has withstood the test of time, it cannot be because of those elements that mark other and similar successful science fiction films.  There are no corresponding battle sequences that stamp, say, INDEPENDENCE DAY, or special effects that characterize any of the ALIENS saga.  What director Robert Wise did was to adapt the original short story, ""Farewell to the Master,"" by Harry Bates to transform a tale warning Earth to forego its mutually assured nuclear destruction into a riveting story that forces viewers to ponder some serious issues of why they are here on this planet and how they can avoid massive self-genocide.  Surprisingly enough, Wise does this without allowing the film's didacticism to dilute audience involvement.
Michael Rennie is Klaatu, an emissary who lands on Earth with the stated intention of saving humanity from itself.  He offers the olive branch of his race, a device that would have eliminated some of man's most persistent problems only to find that a collective fear of the unknown blasted that device to pieces and severely wounded him.  Rennie plays Klaatu as an earnest Christ figure so subliminally that the film morphs into an allegory of man's turning on the One who would die for their collective sins.  Klaatu escapes  from a hospital to assume the name of Carpenter, Jesus's occupation.  He performs miracles: where Jesus turned stone to water, Carpenter turns motion to non-motion by literally turning off Earth's electricity, thus the day of the title. Jesus here is Tom Stevens (slimingly played by Hugh Marlowe), who betrays Klaatu, not for thirty pieces of silver but for the love of a woman (Patricia Neal), who painfully learns that behind the smiling face of that Judas lies the smallness of the insecure mind.  Then there is the resurrection of Klaatu, who ascends, if not to heaven, than at least to his spaceship, which is almost the same thing.  Yet all these allusions to traditional Christianity do not intrude suffocatingly. Indeed, most viewers scarcely recognize them, and it is only after repeated viewings that such correspondances suggest why audiences continually flock to witness Klaatu's Good News.
It is not only the religious coating that marks this film as a classic.  It has a literate script that requires one to listen to well-reasoned ideas rather than to ooh and aah at FX.  Rennie's interpretation of Klaatu is both fluid and soothing.  In his exhortations to mankind to rise from the muck of squalor and viciousness, Klaatu is seen ultimately not so much as a representative of an alien power seeking to impose its will on a protesting humanity, but more as an inverted symbol of that humanity.  If Jesus were crucified for being both mortal and semi-devine, then surely Klaatu is meant to be the scapegoat for man's failure to heed his wisdom.  In nearly every scene that Klaatu is in, he is scorned, hunted, shot at, and mocked.  In lashing out at him, the Sanhendrin-like government and mass media exhibit the same lack of acumen that stamps most of the citizens.
The number of special effects are kept to a minimum.  The robot Gort is huge and menacing, but his lethality rests more in what he can do than what he does do.  Klaatu's spaceship does little but squat serenely on the White House lawn, with Klaatu spending only one brief scene aboard.  Some of the film's best moments are of the quiet sort, usually with Rennie in contemplative dialogue with others.  The words that pass back and forth suggest a subtext that if human beings are to avoid self-immolation, then it can occur only through the medium of verbalized reason that will negate the mushrooming clouds.  If and when the nukes fall, it will be because no one had the sense to cry out,""Klaatu Barada Nikto,"" to stop the madness.",1067731200,3,3930,4.860569715142429

The only way to achieve this would be to mask the top and bottom of the original film, since it was shot in an aspect ratio of 1.37 : 1.

443237,5,6302168465,"This movie was made ""way back in the day"", when people demanded excellence.(Even in B movies) There is a PLOT here, a very thought provoking plot. It shows that although standards have slipped abysmally in the past 50 years or so, people have remained the same. No nudity, no swearing, no blood, no gore, just a good solid flick. The other thing that is missing is the sour taste in your mouth from watching the trash that is cranked out of the Hollywood ""sausage factory"" studios these days. This movie is a classic sci-fi standard.",1062547200,10,533,4.621052631578947
443238,5,6302168465,"I wonder whether there was a run on this movie after the great blackout of 2003?  You could pretty much guess the ages of most Baby Boomers by whether we were going around muttering ""Klaatu barada nikto"" between August 14 and 16.  It's humbling to be reminded, over fifty years after this movie was made, how helpless we are when deprived of our sources of artificial energy, and how vulnerable.  And that's just one of many reasons why this movie is still timely.
Despite the fact that the Cold War and the nuclear arms race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. are long over, this is a movie that has worn extremely well.  For one thing, the black and white photography is beautiful, and the shots elegantly composed, and all that comes across extremely well on DVD.  For another, the human story (or perhaps I should say, human-E.T. story) is quite emotionally engaging; the alien ambassador Klaatu is a thoroughly sympathetic character who engages your emotions almost immediately, and his friendship with the young son of the Patricia Neal character is charming.  (Come to think of it, that relationship might have inspired the core story of Spielberg's E.T.) The special effects are fairly simple, but they work well enough to make the story believable; it's refreshing to see a science fiction movie that doesn't depend largely on CGI, explosions and chase scenes for its existence.  And the use of the theremin in the score is brilliant.  So many elements of science fiction movies that later became cliches were still quite original when this movie was made, and they became cliches later mainly because imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Anyway, great flick.  If you're too young to remember it, don't miss it on DVD.",1062115200,7,1730,4.857142857142857

'cause the digital improvements make it seem like you're seeing an entirely new movie. With the quality enhancements and the restoration of the tiny bits and pieces that T.V. has chopped out over the years, this Disc is a STEAL, ESPECIALLY at the ridiculously low price it is being offered.
If you haven't seen ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" on DVD, you just haven't SEEN it(and BOY are you in for a REAL TREAT! ! !)",1058400000,11,525,4.479166666666667
443242,4,6302168465,"Two conditions are necessary if you want to see this film: 1) You have to be a sci-fi fan, or at least have an open mind to the genre. 2) You certainly cannot be one of those people who mock at dated special effects. If you meet these two requirements, then you certainly can enjoy ""The Day the Earth stood still"", one of the capital films made during the Cold War paranoia.
If you're reading this, then you must be a fan already. But just in case you never heard about it before, this is one of those genre pieces everyone knows, even if they've never seen it. It's about an alien visitor who comes to Washington DC in the early 1950's. He brings a message of peace and a warning to the human world, but he gets shot right away when he sets foot off his ship. After escaping the hospital, the alien (Klatuu), who looks exactly like a human, must pass himself as a citizen and stop his robot, Gort, from destroying the Earth in retaliation. In a time of paranoia, tense conflicts and stubborn world leaders (what else is new?), the message that Klatuu brings is, however, difficult to swallow: the only answer to mankind's rule of violence is totalitarism.
The debate about the message continues even today. It doesn't matter if you agree or not, it is as powerful today as it was during the Cold War. Unlike the giant insects movies of the 40's or the silly space serials, ""The Day..."" tried to make a serious statment using sci-fi form. It certainly suceeded, because the movie became a cult classic right away, and the robot Gort was to be one the most recognizable movie icons of all time. The special effects look silly today, but an intelligent script knows how to extract the juice out of the story and avoid the campy elements (mainly because there is very little action).
Now, Fox surely took a sweet time into releasing the film on DVD, but the edition is well worth the wait. The transfer is nearly spotless, both in video quality and sound. Apart from the special editions of ""Psycho"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"", I don't think I've ever seen a B&W restoration this good. I would like to know, however, why it's not in Widescreen format. Maybe somebody else can answer that for me. And the extras surely are great. The disc includes an audio commentary by director Robert Wise, as well a 1 hour documentary about the film and the cult that followed. This documentary includes interviews with the director and producer, among others (and what the heck is Joe Dante doing there anyway?). There's also tons of picture images, including the original posters. One more thing: among the trailers featured on the B-side there was the one from ""5 million years BC"" (you know, the cavemen movie starring Raquel Welch). Does that mean they're going to release that little jewel on DVD as well? I can't wait!
So, to end this extremely long review, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is getting the DVD edition it deserves. It even has Spanish subtitles. Let's hope other cult classics are as lucky as this one.",1058227200,6,3011,4.557195571955719

As a movie, this is a great film on a variety of levels. The preformance are of the best quality (a rarity in 50's scifi films) and the casting and mood are perfect. As a period piece it is simply one of the best films of the 50's, and certainly is the best science fiction film of the entire era. This movie is so well made that even today it has a seamless believability, in spite of the primative special effects.
The moral lesson contained here is both timeless and well expressed. (All World leaders today should have to view this filem at least once a year.) It is interesting that the U.S. military of the pre Korean war years took offense to the anti-war sentiments of the script and would not provide any assistance. All tanks, weapons and military equipment seen in this film were provided by the National Guard. Times have really changed, huh?",1056672000,6,1059,4.380710659898477
443266,5,6302168465,"Science fiction doesn't get much better than this. Sure, the movie is a bit dated (it was filmed in 1951) but ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is still great science fiction. It delivers an important message for the times which, frankly, I'm surprised made it past the censor powers of the time. Still, the message got out and it no doubt contributed to the film winning a Golden Globe in 1952 for ""Best Film Promoting International Understanding.""
The special effects are fairly limited in this movie. Most everything comes from character development and their interactions -- a little different from recent science fiction movies. The score was the first to use this type of eerie sound that was later used widely among films of this genre.
If you enjoy science fiction, particularly classic science fiction, then you'll enjoy this movie. It ranks right up there with Forbidden Planet. ""Klaatu barada nikto,"" one of the quotes from this film made it into several other movies. Several other quotes are good, too. Check out IMDb for a list.
If you don't much care for the genre, then you would do well to skip this film.
The DVD extras are worth checking out. Be sure to watch the ""Movietone Newsreel"" prior to the movie. It'll give you a better understanding of events that took place around the time this movies was released (1951). The commentary with directory Robert Wise had some interesting bits. Be sure that you're wide awake for the commentary -- otherwise you might doze off for parts (like I did). :)

443271,5,6302168465,"Watching this recently, it amazed me how little action there is in this movie, and yet it remains as captivating and enthralling as ever.  There are none of the set pieces we have come to expect in modern genre films: no explosions, no gory deaths, one small chase scene.  Tension is developed through character development and the wonderful performances of Patricia Neal and Michael Rennie, with some wonderful supporting work from Sam Jaffe and Frances Bavier (Mayberry's Aunt Bea!)
There are very few special effects: the odd tank disappears in a glow of light, but other than that, this is a film driven by character development.  Taut direction by Robert Wise, straightforward writing from Edmund North and impressive cinematography by Leo Tower create an intelligent, literate, adult science fiction film that appeals to all ages.
Special mention must be made of Bernard Herrmann's haunting score.  One of the first film scores to use Leon Theremin's eerie and eponymous electronic instrument, which unfortunately became a genre clich, the music adds immeasurably to the tense and unsettling atmosphere.
Modern audiences may find the film's message heavy handed and obvious, relying on 1950's atomic paranoia and the absolute power it brought.  In fact, Klaatu's proffered peaceful solution borders on totalianarianism.  But these are minor considerations considering this is a simple story stunningly told.
The DVD contains many interesting extras of interest to film buffs and collectors, including a shooting script, extended discussions on the evolution of the film from idea to release, and an odd look at the people fascinated with collecting 1950's sci-fi film props and paraphernalia.",1054166400,533,1698,5.388679245283019
443272,5,6302168465,"Although there are numerous exceptions, in general, the 1950s were not a good era for movie making.  And in the field of science fiction - in the pre-Star Wars era, a rather unrespected genre in the film community - the number of good films in that decade are even more rare.  I can really think of only three: Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing from Another World and The Day the Earth Stood Still.
The movie follows the arrival of a flying saucer in Washington D.C.  Within are two occupants - the human-like Klaatu and his menacingly silent robot companion Gort.  After escaping from a brief stay in government custody, Klaatu (whose face is known to very few) takes a room in a boarding house and observes humanity.
Unlike most cinematic aliens, Klaatu is benevolent enough, a messenger who - in the Cold War world - is having trouble getting people to hear his message.  It is also clear he represents aliens who are so far beyond humans technologically that if conflict did arise, Earth would not stand a chance; there would be clever contrivance to stop Klaatu's people.
The Day the Earth Stood Still may seem a little dated (and occasionally preachy) but it is still a great movie.  It also gives us probably the most well-known nonsense words in cinema:  Klaatu Barada Nicto.  What does it mean?  You will need to watch the movie to see.",1053907200,4,1353,4.627615062761507
443273,5,6302168465,"This is a film which withstands the test of time and which is, until our world puts aside war and conflict, timeless.  Although it contains an anachronism or two (the Brits refer to the visitor's spacecraft as a ""buzz bomb"") this story is as relevant today as it was when it came out in the early 1950s.
The basic theme of the film is simple: an ambassador from a nearby world (Venus?  Mars?  we never learn which) comes to Earth to speak to all of the leaders of the world, to send a warning.  The warning is also simple: unless Earth puts aside its warlike ways, other planets will regard Earth as a threat, and this could lead to Earth's destruction.  The alien visitor (""Klaatu"") has little understanding of or sympathy with, the fact that Earth does not speak with one voice and is (at least in the film) unable to even cause its heads of state to sit down in one room together.
The special effects in the film are no great shakes by modern standards, but the truly thought-provoking aspect of this film is the possible reaction of humanity to a sudden visit from an alien world, revealing that we are not alone.  Patricia Neal and Michael Rennie (Klaatu) turn in bravura performances.  This is a fine film which, despite being a product of the 1950s, is still very worthwhile, and excellent entertainment.",1053907200,4,1311,4.553191489361702

This is really a great film with a great score.

Who can forget their first sight of the mighty Gort walking down the ramp or melting entire tanks, or Klaatu's empassioned farewell plea for humanity?

443297,5,6302168465,"Even if you're not the greatest sci-fi fan one should consider the content of this classic an even valuable message for earth today. Director Robert Wise (West Side Story, The Sound of Music) creates an intelligent observation of the good and bad side of human nature. What remains classic in it's message today is what if Klaatu returned to earth again only to find mankind didn't change much. Michael Rennie is superb in his performance as Klaatu, the alien messenger. He imparts a warning to Earth to end thier violent behavior or suffer the consequences. His classic line to Earth, ""Your choice is simple. Join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration. We shall be waiting for your answer. The decision rests with you."" He projects the wisdom and intelligence in his character. Can you imagine Claude Rains in his place? Klaatu lives with a family as a boarder to observe and blend into society. Another great performance is by Patricia Neal (Breakfast at Tiffany's) in her role as Helen. In the scene where Gort is about to aim at her and Earth's inhabitats, she keeps her composure. She stands before the big sleek robot and says, ""Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!"" That phrase had become a popular sci-fi fan adage over time and has been featured in other movies. I don't think that any other sci-fi film has matched it's quality and intelligence. It's quite different from your typical alien invasion movie.",1051660800,5,1441,4.814516129032258
443298,5,6302168465,"This is the best, and one of the oldest believe it or not, science fiction films ever made. The quality of the special effects was decades before it's time. The spacecraft flying scenes still amaze me.
The film has a strong message. Mankind isn't ready to become a member of a greater system of beings, and if we continue to develop our space program, alongside our weapons of mass destruction, we will have to be eliminated. This is because only ten years before, we had created the first atomic bomb, and have started sending people into space. The other civilized worlds in the galaxy have learned to live in peace, and don't need us around mucking it up. They give us an ultimatum, learn to live in peace, or be destroyed.
The apparent war-like paranoia of the human race is shown in the first scene of the film. Michael Rennie walks out of his ship and is immediately shot by a soldier. What a way to greet an out-of-towner! Anyway, he ultimately sneaks out of the hospital, and goes around D.C. with a young boy, trying to find something that will convince him that mankind is worth saving. He visits places like the Lincoln Memorial, where he's impressed, only to then visit Arlington Cemetery, where he's apalled.
The DVD has a few extras that make this even sweeter, such as the 'making of' featurette. This was shown on AMC, and is very good. It explains how many of the actors in the film were blacklisted during the communist hearings of the 50's, because of the message of the film. What a crock. Anyway, this was the paranoia the film parodies.
If you want to add a good science fiction film, that doesn't have lots of blood and gore, get this one, it's the best.",1050969600,7,1677,4.519736842105263
443299,5,6302168465,"An unidentified flying object is circulating the earths atmosphere at a speed of 4000 miles per hour and people begin to fear what it wants.  When the flying saucer lands in Washington D.C., soldiers surround the spaceship and are extremely nervous.  As the aliens exits the space craft, they says that they have come in peace and then raise a strange metallic object.  This triggers a solider to shot the alien who falls to the ground and as a result a giant robot appears from within the spaceship and begins to eliminate all hostile objects.  However, the alien orders the robot to cease destroying the human weapons and is helped by the humans.  At the hospital, a creature looking like a homo sapien appears from within the space suit and he wants to see all the leaders of the world, which is explained to be rather difficult due to the ongoing Cold War.  The Day Earth Stood Still is a frightening science fiction story where the concept of aliens appearing on earth is reversed to what is more popular in cinema.  The story keeps the audience chained to their chairs in suspense which also can cause the audience to loose itself in thoughts.

With its subtle allegory of the story of Christ, this multi-layered yet simple cautionary tale is a must in any serious videophile's DVD library.

443301,5,6302168465,"Numerous reviews have already stated various things about this classic so I'm going to focus on the things I'm not seeing immediately. This movie is an example of great sci-fi that may appeal to those who wouldn't normally watch sci-fi. As with most of the better sci-fi, there are hidden political and social comments. This could be why the insert includes statements about how the extras don't reflect the views of the studio.
The image and sound quality is the best I've seen of this movie. It has been cleaned up so there are only minor specks here and there. They're only noticeable if you're looking for them.
Although I'm not a fan of two sided DVDs, the extras here are wonderful. Personally, I'd prefer two separate DVDs, and the second side should have some kind of label. Some people may assume they can't play the other side since there's no indication that the side B exists. I could figure it out, but there may be some who don't.
The Movietone newsreel is complete. It contains a segment with Klaatu at a convention receiving an award which has been shown on the Fox Movie Channel. The newsreel also includes the signing of the Japanese Peace Treaty, Gen. MacArthur announcing that POWs will be returning home soon, G.I.s encountering floods in Korea, and clips from Miss. America and Mrs. America pageants.
This DVD also has the THX intro with the cows which is my personal favorite.
The ""Making of..."" documentry is interesting but fairly basic with talking head shots and some clips from the movie. The documentry contains one error that I know of. Julian Blaustein incorrectly states that, in the short story, the military shoots Klaatu. That only happens in the movie, not Harry Bates' story.
There are major differences between the movie and Harry Bates' Farewell To The Master. First off, Klaatu is dead at the beginning of the story, shot by someone who was ""mentally unbalanced."" The entire story focuses on a reporter observing the robot, called Gnut instead of Gort. The ship didn't land either. It simply appeared like Dr. Who's TARDIS. Klaatu steps out wearing robes instead of a space suit. The short story doesn't have the same political statements that the movie makes. As the documentry suggests, it would have worked well for a Twilight Zone episode. Right now, all copies of the short story are out of print. On Amazon, I found a used copy of They Came From Outer Space, edited by Jim Wynorski, which contains the original short story.
The early 1950s brought us some great sci-fi movies, and this one is highly recommended for any fans of the genre. Since the bulk of the story is dramatic, it might be enjoyed by a wider audience. There is very little sci-fi type action - no UFOs destroying buildings or aliens killing off humans. The action focuses on a misunderstood, peaceful alien trying to survive so he can deliver an important message to the people of Earth.",1050624000,3,2902,4.759920634920635
443332,3,6302168465,"The production is a product of the times. The studio couldn't see telling you the REAL story as written, so they FAKED the ENDING to ruin all the meaning the author intended. The movie is inferior to others around at that time by being hyper. The 3 stars are for the production--but it should be -10 for the ending.

443333,5,6302168465,"It has been at least fifty years and I remembered every scene! This film remains a classic that defines the genre.

Although immersed in the paranoia of the Fifties, the spaceman and the robot remain timeless. The spaceman comes through as an empathetic but unsympathetic alien with a message to deliver. He is unswayed by the current political climate and refuses to take sides in our ""irrelevent conflicts.""  The character of Gort, the robot manages to convey menace without uttering a sound and being imobile throughout most of the film. A mere turn of the robot's head was enough to cause me to run for cover. Yet it is shown to be an intelligent and complex being.

Throughout, the story relies little on special effects.  Even the spaceship is spartan with virtually none of the ever present knobs and dials we are used to seeing in an alien craft.

This should be on everyone's Must Have list.",1050364800,4,900,4.707006369426751
443334,5,6302168465,"For those outside the ""Know,"" this film is one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made.  It ranks second in my personal ""Top Five.""  It combines mythic elements, current issue relevance, and of course scintillating special effects to bring a wallop of a film.
The story is deceptively simple.  The aliens are concerned about our atomic infancy, especially combining atomics with rockets.  Klaatu lands in a baseball field in Washington D. C.  Klaatu has a rough encounter with the Army, and is shot.  He meets with the Secretary of state to get an audience with all nations, but it flops.  Unable to get a political solution, he decide to become human, and study humanity incognito.  He assumes the name ""Carpenter,"" and goes to a boarding house, and meet Helen Benson and her son Bobby.
Young Bobby provides a great window on humanity, since he is young and has not been corrupted by money and folly.  The most touching moment is when Klaatu and Bobby visit his father at Arlington.
Klaatu  decides to get a scientific solution to the problem of meeting, so he tracks down Nobel Laureate Professor Bernhard.  Klaatu and the Prof decide to call a meeting of scientist to hear Klaatu's message.  Before they meet, they demonstrate Klaatu's power by stopping all electricity on earth for half an hour.
...P>The meeting of minds happens and Klaatu explains that Gort is one of an army of robots that enforces peace in the galaxy: ""In matters of aggression, we have given them absolute power over us. This power cannot be revoked. At the first signs of violence, they act automatically against the aggressor. The penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk.""
Klaatu concludes his message: ""Your choice is simple. Join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration. We shall be waiting for your answer. The decision rests with you.
I think the staying power comes from Rennie's acting ability.  He is thin, and gaut, with intriguing features-he looks like Jesus.  His New England accents gives a sheen to his character, and he mixes childlike wonder with stern authority.  He was perfectly cast, and this film is his masterpiece.
Gort is a streamline moderne masterpiece.  He is not as flashy as Robbie, and does not have the pluck of R2-D2, but there is something about him-the brooding and quiet steel exterior that reflects his steel interior.  At times you see the costume and not the character, but with a friendly eye you get pulled into the illusion.
I appreciate the care that Fox took to restore this classic of classic.  The picture was sharp and clear. It looks like it was filmed yesterday; hopefully it will last forever.
I must comment on the music.  This film popularized the Theremin, the ""oooh-ooh"" sound from the Beach Boy's ""Good Vibrations.""  It reminds me of the muisc in ""Forbidden planet."" It is otherworldly, eerie, and  a far cry from the booming John William's ""Star Wars"" anthems.
There is one odd surprise: the boarding house is owned by Mrs. Barley, played by Francis Bavier, better known as ""Aunt Bee"" from the Andy Griffith show.  She just looks odd in this sci-fi classic film,
The extra's are killer.  Fox went hog wild, and made all the hard core fans very happy.  They has the shooting script, many production and promotional photos, and a 70 minute documentary.  They also included the Movietone newsreel, where Klaatu got an award from a sci-fi organization.  But they also included the rest of the newsreel, so you get a feel for the times and events of 1951.
I have two complaints.  First of all, this DVD is double-sided, so you need to be very careful as you grab the disk.  Moreover, you cannot set the DVD down, except in the case.  I would prefer paying more for two DVDs (which is what Lucas does with his films), than have to deal with a two-faced DVD.  They are just too awkward.
Secondly, the DVD cover is inferior to the video cover.  The DVD is pale and anemic, while the VHS is a lively riot of color and energy.  It looks like the 1930's propaganda posters of the Soviet Union.  It grabs your eye and arrests your imagination.  Furthermore, I find it easier to find the products I like if the DVD and the VHS covers are identical.  Once again, remember Lucas sets the industry standard here.",1050278400,7,4279,4.713324360699866
443335,5,6302168465,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the greatest movies of the Communist scare era. It is tense, gripping and exciting in the opening confrontation and is a study of emotional reaction to the unknown. All of the characters are typical post
World War 2 Americans, simplistic in lifestyle and philosophy and are brought to life with an amazing list of stock character actors in all of the minor roles. Patricia Neal as a co-star is excellent,and though somewhat older,her beauty is still present, only surpassed perhaps when she co-starred in ""The Fountainhead"" with Gary Cooper. From ""Aunt Bee"" as a boarder in the house who would soon appear on ""Andy Griffith"" as the maid,to Sam Jaffe as an ""Einstein"" type professor, this movie captures all of the flavor of the time period and remains somewhat tense and scary to this day due to the unforgettable musical score of Bernard Hermann and the presence of a gigantic robot known as ""Gort"". The music, produced by a type of ""harp"" is perhaps the strangest ever to associate with a film save for ""Forbidden Planet"". If the film has any weakness, it is that the portrayal of ""common folk"" can be equated as ""dumb"", especially when Klaatu is interviewed by an unsuspecting news reporter hawking the crowd for ""fear"" comments.(Another film that displayed common folk as having low IQ's was ""War of the Worlds"" with Gene Barry)  Still, the film is a science fiction icon, a classic in every sense of the word, and this DVD is a superior product. The quote for the title of this review is from the movie. When the film shows the world is stopped and travels from country to country, in England,a british working class man makes that classic comment! The film also embraces a view of an all knowing creator, something lacking in today's films. The film may be too intense for young children, as the presence of Gort and the dark imagery of black and white filming combined with chilling music can cause nightmares, so use parental discretion.",1050105600,2,1985,4.736994219653179
443336,5,6302168465,"To those of us of a ""certain"" age, those words will surely resonate far more strongly than ""Use the Force, Luke,"" or even ""Beam me up, Scotty!"" (Hey, I know the Trek line is a misquote, but you know what I mean!) ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" is THE seminal Sci Fi film of the 50's, the film that finally treated extraterrestrials as something more than bug-eyed monsters intent on taking over the World, stealing our beer, and our girlfriends, for no other reason than that they could!
The film hits the ground running, through a documentary style montage, we see worldwide reaction to the news that a strange craft is orbiting the Earth at incredible speed. Cut to Washington DC, and said craft, a beautifully classic ""saucer,"" lands in a park, scattering picnickers and baseball players like confetti. The next thing we know, the Military are on hand ASAP to deal with the ""threat;"" the saucer opens, and out steps Klaatu, an emissary from a ""Federation of Planets"" type body. They have been observing us with increasing worry; at our endless propensity for self-destruction, our development of nuclear weapons, but more importantly, our first, faltering steps into space.
Klaatu holds out with a gift for the President, and is immediately shot by a trigger-happy GI, thinking the device is an alien ""death-ray..."" not a particularly good start to interstellar relationships! As Klaatu writhes on the ground, from out of the ship steps the ""iron fist"" within Klaatu's ""velvet glove;"" an 8ft tall, indestructible robot named Gort. Now Gort HAS a death-ray, and he unleashes it in short order, not indiscriminately against the troops and civilians, but with precision, as he zaps rifles, artillery pieces, and finally a couple of tanks, into oblivion!
When you think about it, this is an incredibly original, and thoughtful, scene. In just about every film of this kind that had come before - and more than a few that have come since! - this kind of action would have resulted in wholesale destruction...Anyway, Gort's reaction to the attack on Klaatu betrays a superior intelligence at work: a measured response to a threat situation, instead of just nuking the planet to dust and ashes!
Klaatu is taken to hospital for treatment. But frustrated at ""our"" inability to come together and heed his ""message,"" he transforms himself, with the help of a freshly dry-cleaned suit, and a monogrammed briefcase, into ""Mr Carpenter,"" so he can lose himself within human society, all the better to study us. It is in this part of the film that the 1950's ""Reds under the bed"" paranoia really comes into focus.
Mr Carpenter befriends a mother, ""Helen,"" wonderfully played by Patricia Neal, and her young son ""Bobby"" played by Billy Gray. And I think it's this casting, plus the characterization, that does so much to make the film work. The main casting coup was getting Michael Rennie in the role of Klaatu. At the time, Rennie was a stage actor working in Britain, he'd never been seen in the US, so when he walks out of the saucer, he really is, to all intents and purposes, an ""alien,"" unknown and unfamiliar. Tall, almost painfully slim, aesthetic in appearance, urbane in his manner, he really was as far removed from the ""alien invader"" look and persona as it was possible to get! Patricia Neal's ""Helen"" is a single mother, an unusual lead role in 50's cinema, and she imparts her character with a great deal of self-sufficiency and ""grit."" Again, not the usual running/screaming/fainting leading lady. Billy Gray is a joy to watch, he portrays ""Bobby"" with that breathless wide-eyed innocence - ""...can we go see the spaceship mister, can we, huh , can we please mister?!?!?!"" - that really only existed, if ever, in 50's America.
Luminous black and white photography, a solid story, a tight, pared-to-the-bone script, naturalistic(!) performances, integral ""news broadcasts"" and ""interviews,"" plus a gorgeous soundtrack, all come together to tell the fantastical tale of TDTESS in an almost documentary style.
This was one of the first films I looked for on Amazon when I got my hands on a new shiny-disc player last year, and having watched this wonderful film on TV and video over the years, I can say that this DVD release was well worth the wait! The restoration is superb - never having owned a Laser Disc system I can't comment on those versions - and is light years ahead of the last video version I purchased back in the 90's. My one regret is that while restoring the film they didn't take out the ""wires"" and the ""lacing,"" on Gort's suite, that can be momentarily seen in one pivotal sequence. But that is a minor gripe; this is a superb, intelligent Sci Fi film, fully deserving of its ""classic"" status, and a must-have for any serious lover of the genre!",1049500800,19,4768,4.830073349633252

FANTASTIC!  This thoughtful and intelligent film is even more relevant today than when it was made. Its message of peaceful co-existence is heart-warming. Too bad the human race can't learn to live in peace. Many have stated that if Klaatu knew how little progress we have made since his journey to earth, he'd be disappointed. Maybe. But at least we are still confining our wars to just our world and not threatening the other planets, our space program being in a directionless shambles. We are no threat to the universe, just ourselves. So Klaatu can rest easy and Gort can cool his jets. We're much too primitive a people to threaten the safety of the universe. At least, for now.

443397,4,6302168465,"Fox has rereleased this classic mixture of drama and science fiction as part of its Studio Classics DVD collection. The DVD contains a restored and remastered version of the film that's out of this world. Extra features are interesting, but a bit dated -- they debuted on laserdisc in the mid-'90s.
""The Day the Earth Stood Still's"" silvery black-and-white images benefit greatly from the film's latest restoration, as demonstrated on one of the extras. The superimposed images of the actors in Washington blend in much better in the fine grain than on the laserdisc version. Night shots are breathtaking. The film is presented full frame (1.33:1).
The restoration gives Bernard Herrmann's brilliant score extra punch, even in simple stereo, with the din of the spaceship's landing pounding out of the subwoofer. Herrmann employed a pair of electronic Theramins to crank up the eerie mood.
Wise does a good job on the commentary, which touches on the edgy political climate back in 1950, camera techniques and working with the great Herrmann. A 70-minute documentary features interviews with Wise, producer Julian Blaustein, actress Patricia Neal and Billy Gray, the former child actor. Gray, in particular, has a great perspective on the film. Other extras include the shooting script, a terrific newsreel from 1951 and extensive still galleries.
Wise talks about how well the film has held up for contemporary viewers, and he's right. My 10 yr. old who loves ""Alien"" and the like watched this film with rapt attention. ""Don't tell me this is anything but way cool,"" he said.",1047859200,3,1576,5.112403100775194

443400,4,6302168465,"""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" is a fable for adults, the moral of the story being that mankind is doomed to self destruct unless he mends his ways and chooses peace over war.  The film stars Michael Rennie as the human/alien space traveller and Patricia Neal as the earthling who learns his secret.  Robert Wise has directed, perhaps, the best sci-fi movie of the decade, with adept concision and wit.  This is a classic that still holds its own.
The DVD transfer from FOX is near pristine.  Although it is self evident from the main title sequence onward that major restoration work has been done on the film, there is still a considerable amount of video noise present in background information, particularly in the opening scenes where the space ship lands in Washington.  Also in this sequence, are nicks, chips and scratches inherent in the original camera negative.  Some minor shimmering details are detected but nothing that will terribly distract.  The stunning ""film noir-ish"" photography is, for the most part, beautifully rendered on this DVD.  The soundtrack has been remixed to 5.1 and is worthy of mention here.

443427,4,6302168465,"I have been a fan of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" for several years. When I first saw it, I was impressed that there was a 50's Sci-Fi that was thoughtful of current events.
It also seemed to set the standard for Sci-Fi for the next 17 years.
But recently I have given it more consideration. Although the film quickly criticizes American and former Soviet Union cold war politics, it totally ignores the politics of Klatuu's society. For example, what type of government does Klatuu's people have? What would it be like to have Giant robots roaming earth waiting to ""neutralize"" an aggressor? Is that democracy? Socialism? No. That's not even Fascism. It's almost like this film found a way to make us believe that a ""Big Brother"" society would achieve world peace. After having read George Orwell's ""1984"", how could we come to this conclusion.
Think of it this way. A husband and wife are having an argument. The husband hits his wife. Would Gort burst through the wall and zap the husband? Would the wife say ""Thanks, Gort. I don't think the anger management classes would have worked anyway. Besides, as soon as hit me, I instantly stopped loving him."" If we really consider having Robot Policemen in our society we realize that it wouldn't work. Therefore, if it wouldn't work, who is Klatuu to tell us how to run our society?
Ask yourself this: Who would carry out the destruction of earth? If Klatuu destroyed earth, would Gort ""neutralize"" him? Would some other robot ""neutralize"" Gort? I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. Klatuu criticizes the very politics that he is using.
Klatuu's hypocritical culture is loosely based off of ours. For example, people find it okay to murder a doctor that performs abortions. There is truth in this movie, but not that Klatuu's culture is superior to our own. The truth is: we fear a culture that is superior in strength. Just like we fear God. But God is guilty of the same crimes as us.
In conclusion, Klatuu's robot police would defiantly end war. But that wouldn't end violence. It would just be somebody else committing the violence.",1047427200,,2099,4.722070844686648

There are a couple of moments in the film that are very poignant and make my mind soar, moment's like where Klaatu speaks with the Professor for the first time, and in a calm collected voice says, ...(Klaatu)""the Earth would be Eliminated...(the Professor) such power exists?...(Klaatu), I assure you, such power exists!"", and of course the speech Klaatu gives before leaving just before the end, and when Klaatu speaks to the Government Official in the beginning of the film and refers to ""petty squabbles"", an impatience with stupidity, references to time and measurement in terms of ""of your months"" and ""of your miles""...this is all correct scripting, this kind of detail is good and needs to remain if a remake ever gets planned, try to keep in homage with the original, and may I suggest that Robert Zemeckis be the one to Direct it, a director with vision. And might I say one more thing,
I was so surprised to see the scene where Gort lifts Patricia Neal
and carrys her, I don't know how many times I've seen this film, but this is the first time that I've noticed the support wires attached to a gurney to aid Lock Martin (Gort) to carry Helen (Patricia Neal), such is the improvement in picture quality!....

443429,5,6302168465,"At a time when nuclear and biological warfare loom over our heads, the simple message of 1951's ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" couldn't be more timely. The best sci-fi film of the 50's (and arguably the best ever made) has been handled with care and looks wonderful on disc. It retains its' mystery and suspense after all these years thanks to several key factors. One being the masterful direction of Robert Wise. Another is the great acting of the cast. But the most subtle element is the fantastic score by Bernard Herrmann---it is beautifully orchestrated to match and interlock each scene giving the film an almost seamless coherence. It's a memorable score and is hugely responsible for giving the film its' edge as well as its' class.
This film has a good subtle script also that never seems pedestrian. It has nice tight dialogue. Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) is not your average sci-fi film heroine either. She's portrayed as an intelligent working woman and mother. She doesn't succumb to hysteria. She functions heroically in the face of danger and only screams once. And then her terror is easily justified as she's at the mercy of Gort the robot and knows its' power. Another interesting aspect of this classic is the close-ups of the faces in the crowd scenes. They are multi-culturally diverse. They are not all white. Pretty cool for 1951. Everything about this film is natural and has that ""hey it could happen"" quality. Even ""Klaatu Barada Nikto"".

Unlike its famous ""right-wing"" counterpart, ""The Thing (From Another World)"" where science and the intelligencia were treated with suspicion, if not disdain, and it was all up to the military to save the day,  ""Day"" presents the military and modern weapons of mass destruction as the essence of the problem and has the international scientific community banding together to teach the politicians a thing or two.  The Army comes off as inept, at best.  Naturally, they refused to provide men and equipment for the filming.
Both ""Day"" and ""The Thing"" are wonderful films, among the best of their time.  And don't forget Bernard Herrmann's breathtaking score!
The film is presented in its original 1:37  or ""Full Screen"" aspect ratio and does not need to be letterboxed.  Picture is first-rate.

The kid who plays her son showed up later as ""Bud"" in Father Knows Best. Now the bad part: the speechifying Rennie does at the end is a turn-off for people who are politically aware and conservative. Rennie basically advocates turning Earth's sovereignty over to a galactic United Nations, including the threat of complete annihilation if we don't ""obey"" and ""stay within the guidelines"" and ""play nice with each other"". Given the UN's recent performance as an effete and impotent debating society that accomplishes nothing this would seem to be bad advice. I cannot watch the movie anymore without that last soliloquy souring the overall great effect. I know, get over it. Gort is definitely cool, though. Only understands Latin, understated malevolence, the threat of violence to keep you in line, the original Robocop. A UN with actual teeth, a backbone, and true impartiality, unlike anything we have now. Maybe it would work? These are scary times, but it was just as scary back then  - it was 1951, we just got out of a war 6 years ago, now we're in Korea providing the men, muscle, and blood for a UN-sanctioned ""police action"" against an insane Communist dictator running a bellicose North Korea and backed up by China, plus we've just realized we're in a nuclear stare-down with the Soviets.

It arrived yesterday and I immediately sat down to watch it, eager to see the restoration.  I was incredibly pleased until the scene where Gort picks up Patricia Neal to take her into the spaceship.  Suddenly, lines appeared on the print, looking almost like strings attached to Patricia Neal because the robot could not hoist or carry her. It looked like all those cheesy sci-fi films where you can see the strings attached to the flying saucers! I cannot believe the company could release this important film with this important scene in such shoddy condition.  What print did they use for the scene?  I checked an old video which I had taped off of television and the lines were nowhere to be seen in it.  If a crummy tv print is better than a restoration, then the company wasted its time and my money.  And there was a noticeable difference in stock quality in a close up of Patricia Neal in the same sequence.  It looked as if a third rate print had suddenly been used for this close-up.
It took so long for this film to come out, why couldn't they have taken greater care to make a supposedly pristine print, pristine?  I am really disappointed.",1046995200,,1250,4.47136563876652

It is wonderful to be able to look at the detail here.  I was born 5 years after the movie was made.  By the time I was able to read, upon seeing the movie (on B&W TV!) I couldn't read the sign on the boarding house - I assumed it read ""room for rent.""  In this film, I can now read that sign and I can see the clouds when the ship first lands.  Buildings and other scenes are not white washed of detail.  Again, the audio is great.  One can really appreciate Bernard Herrmann's work here.  It completes the film.  I can't say enough about the film and the story.  Others here have done well so I won't attempt a repeat.
So unworthy of a great film now restored and available (I can remove my copy from my TiVo!), there are two great disappointments with this DVD production.  (I've not yet watched the 70-Minute ""Making the Earth Stand Still"" Documentary.)
The first disappointment is the missing ending credits.
The most distressing thing about this DVD is the commentary.  Unlike the sentiments of a previous reviewer, I have to say it was very very disappointing.  Nicolas Meyer could barely keep on the topic of the movie.
What was the significance of the address on Harvard Street?  Anything?  Not even a mention of Aunt Bee.  How was that language devised?  Latin?  Over probably the most famous line in science fiction (along with 'live long and prosper'), ""Klaatu, barata, nikto"" Meyer led Wise down some other random esoteric diatribe.  At one point, Wise started to provide some background about the military base scene (where the 'duce-and-a-half's were assembling) but was cut off by Meyer on some other arcane issue of directing.  I would have liked to hear a little more about the equations on the blackboard....
That ship!!!  What were some of the inspirations for the ship and its inside design - those displays - the inner 'control' room?  Was that center bubble used on the Jupiter 2 (""Lost in Space"")?  How did Gort come into being?  What was any thinking behind the cool ray that Gort carried.  Melting the artillery was pretty cool.
I can't say how almost angry I was at this conversation.  I guess my expectations were set by the fine commentary in other DVD's (such as Gladiator!).  If anybody out there is listening, I'd buy another copy with Wise talking to somebody who loved the movie ABOUT the movie.  I did learn a few things such as Wise having no idea of the Christ analogy until well after the film was complete or the DOD not wanting to help in the production.  Rather than a commentary, this was more one director comparing methodologies and practices with another.
My wife and four year old daughter have seen the movie twice on TiVo.  My daughter (her first black and white movie) again sat with me glued to the set to watch the DVD the night it arrived.  When I got my first DVD player, this is the movie I waited for.  I'm glad I have it!",1046995200,,3098,4.475
443487,5,6302168465,"OK, you all know the film's a classic.  Maybe THE classic fifties sci-fi film.  So let's talk about the disc itself.  As expected, the transfer is first-rate (never in my wildest dreams would have thought I'd ever see a THX-certified copy of this movie).  The 70 minute documentary is chock full of good interviews, though the productions values of the program itself leave a bit to be desired.  And an interesting choice for the audio commentary: One well-respected genre director (Nicholas Meyer) interviewing another (Robert Wise).  Meyer obviously has a deep respect for this type of film and the era in which it was made, and his questions are as thought-provoking as Wise's responses are insightful.  The 1951 newsreel is a nice touch, putting the viewer into the political climate of the year in which DAY was released.

443561,5,6302168465,"Robert Wise has had a storied career. He began as an editor working for Orson Welles on Citizen Kane and eventually moved on to director and producer. Because his themes vary he, like Michael Curtiz, isn't seen as a ""auteur"" or author of his films. The French auteur theory overlooked the fact that film is very much a collaborative medium. It also overlooked the fact that an artist plays with a variety of themes regardless of whether or not they are personal.
Day is an example of what Wise has always done best; his forte was creating intelligent, enjoyable films that straddled the line between the old guard of Hollywood and the new, more message orientated films. Day, based on the short story Farewell To The Master (with a wicked twist not spelled out in the final film but twisted around with a touch of irony).
Klattu arrives on Earth with both a warning and a greeting; if you intend to join the community of space be prepared to leave your agression behind. While the deft screenplay is occasionally heavy handed (not unusual for a 50's science fiction film), it's, on the whole, a brilliant look at humanity from the outside in. The suggestion that Klattu is a Christ-like figure here to sermonize on humanity's faults and providing humanity with the choice of salvation or damnation could have been overkill in another director's hands. Wise's intelligent direction highlights the strongest aspects of the well written script. Klattu is attacked, hunted down and killed because he threatens the very essence of our freedom. His message that freedom, any freedom, comes with costs and limitations is lost on the rest of the world initially.
The cast including the marvelous Michael Rennie (Hollywood never did figure out what to do with this terrific talent), talented Patricia Neal and B-Movie stalwart Hugh O'Brien bring the story to life with minimal fuss (no elaborate special effects sequences or props except for the ship and Gort).
The commentary by director Robert Wise and writer/director Nicholas Meyer (a bit of trivia--both directors made Star Trek films as well)is informative. Meyer's hyperactive commentary works well against Wise's more laconic observations. My only complaint is that Meyer could have kept his questions directed more towards the making of the film. Then, again, since it's 50 years later, Wise does point out he doesn't remember a lot about the making of the film.
Possibly the most interesting observations come from director Joe Dante who puts the film's importance into perspective. Most science fiction films from the 50's that use real cities and backgrounds help ground these types of films in reality making them a bit more believable than films set in the future.
The crisp, black and white images reproduced on the DVD bring the film to life after a long purgatory of poor video transfers. The transfer here is about the best I've seen (although the laserdisc was very close). In fact, the print is so well restored on DVD that the wires holding Patricia Neal when Gort (Lock Martin) picks her up are in evidence. Perhaps the contrast should have been a bit darker there...There are a few analog artifacts on the mono soundtrack--it sounds a bit too flat for my tastes but, on the whole, the transfer is splendid. It's nice to finally have this seminal and important film finally available on DVD.
If you don't like dual sided discs, you'll find it annoying to have to flip it over for most of the supplements (the documentary is on side B). I don't imagine that you'll be flipping it over that often as the documentary is servicible but unimaginative in the way it's put together. It's more of the talking heads variety documentary. Still, it's nice to have the comments from the producer & director (although screenwriter Edmund North who deserves a lot of praise for his intelligent script must no longer be alive. Still, couldn't they have found his wife or someone else that was involved to comment from his perspective?).
All told Day is a class act and much improved over the Laserdisc because of the extras(and a huge leap over the video edition)that came out in 1993. One surprise is that I didn't know that the film had picked up a 1951 Golden Globe for Best Picture.",1044921600,,4234,4.857538035961272

Mainly I'm interested in responding to the review titled ""The Day The Brain Stood Still"".  I went through his list of questions and found that with the exception (in my opinion) of only three or four of them they are all easily explainable.  In fact many of the things that bother him actually make a great deal of sense when you think about them.  For those of you who have not seen this movie do not base any disinterest in watching it based on that review.

The other reviewer called his review ""The Day the Brain Stood Still"", without stopping to think that he might himself be the stupid one. He made so many 'points' that he thought (thought, good one) were relevant. They're not.
This film is not perfect. None are. What it is, is one of the finest examples of a science fiction film using allegory to address a contemporary social/political issue. Remember when they used to do that? Somewhere along the way, entertainment lost its brains, not the other way around.
I haven't seen this film for a few years, but I remember it very, very well, and it occured to me just now that given the state of the world at the moment, I think maybe we could do with this message being sent again. And that means directing it at Bush more than anyone else. Sure, you might say Bush is like Klaatu, trying to police the world and keep nuclear weapons under control. But what this film reminds me of is that it is the job of the UN, not W, to keep the world under control. And besides, I don't think Klaatu was more concerned in getting his hands on our oil.
Besides the film's message, the fact that it has been referenced so many times in other movies that proves the lasting testament to what really is great cinema.",1041984000,8,1358,4.30859375
443566,5,6302168465,"Of all the great sci fi classics from the 1950s, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL might be the most remarkable. While many of the other films viewed alien arrivals as menacing threats to be responded to with force or as political parables on the threat of communism (both THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS are examples), this film instead imagined an alien visitor as morally superior and more peaceful than human beings. Some have suggested, in fact, that Klaatu, played marvelously by Michael Rennie, was a Christ figure. In the film, he dies and is shockingly resurrected, and the name he adopts incognito is Mr. Carpenter. Furthermore, the message he brings is one of peace and the necessity of controlling our civilization's tendency towards militaristic aggression. None of these were widely expressed themes in 1951, when the film came out.
The film is also remarkable for one of the great screen robots, Gort, played by 7'7 Lock Martin. I still remember as a child the awful terror of seeing his visor gradually open near the end as Patricia Neal strives to get the words ""Klaatu barada nikto"" out of her mouth, and the relief of seeing the visor gradually close.
Unlike many other 1950s sci fi films, most of which barely came up to the level of B pictures, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL features a first rate cast. Very few films of the decade features any actresses remotely in Patricia Neal's class as a performer. Most were merely attractive manikins. Neal gives the film a strong female presence almost completely lacking in all other films of the 1950s, perhaps matched only by Dana Wynter in INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. Michael Rennie never had the kind of career that his talent would seem to have generated, but he imbued his performance as Klaatu with a deep and profound dignity. And the always memorable Sam Jaffe is a delight as the scientist Klaatu asks to act as an intermediary to the world's scientific community.

Klaatu is a being from another planet who lands in Washington DC to military power who capture him. He asks for a meeting with the leaders of every country to send them a message, but due to hate, suspicion, and war, this cannot be done. Klaatu then escapes and spends some time learning about our culture. He seeks a scientist to organize the meeting and he agrees. Humans don't want to listen to Klaatu, he observes that the only time they will understand, or take notice is after violent action. Will humans accept his message or will they be obliterated?
This is one of the first films to show aliens as peaceful, instead of monsters trying to take over Earth. There is good social commentary, and revealing of our negative attitudes and selfish, greedy ways. The film is well directed and acted, and the story is a very good one.

443677,5,6302168465,"In many respects THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is a very dated film. Obviously a comment on Cold War paranoias, it has little in the way of special effects or high-class production values, Edmund H. North's script is surprisingly talky, and it captures the very clunky look of late-1940s/early-1950s America to an uncomfortable degree.  Certainly few involved in the project took it very seriously--even leading lady Patricia Neal admitted that she and Michael Rennie had tremendous difficulty keeping straight faces while spouting ""Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!""  But strangely, against all the odds, the film continues to speak, capturing the imagination of each new generation that sees it.

The film's enduring power seems to arise from its very simplicity, which lifts the story of a visitor from outer space from mere sci-fi pulp to the level of a parable.  As frequently noted, the film contains significant religious symbolism. It is easy to read the visitor as Christ, the woman who befriends him as Mary Magdalene, the man who betrays him as Judas, and the message the visitor brings as both call to repentance and opportunity for redemption--and whatever one's actual religious beliefs, the film taps into these archetypes to create a very effective modern morality tale that works on several levels.  At the same time, the film makes a surprisingly acid comment on American and international politics, small minded bigotry, and media hysteria that still rings true today. And the film has surprising visual power.  Although the cinematography is very basic, and the design of both the spaceship and the robot Gort are very simple, they combine to create a number of startling images: the first moment that Gort is seen standing on the spaceship's ramp; the spacecraft interior; Gort as he menaces a screaming Patricia Neal--images so simple and yet so powerful that they have become part of our cultural landscape.

The cast plays very unpretentiously and cleanly, and although Rennie and Neal may have snickered on the set none of it shows in their performances. Both are very memorable.  Hugh Marlowe is appropriately smarmy as Neal's unpleasant boyfriend, and Sam Jaffe and Billy Gray are enjoyable in their supporting roles; film buffs will also enjoy seeing Frances Bavier (television's ""Aunt Bea"") in a rare film appearance.  Robert Wise's direction is impressively unobtrusive, and any review that did not reference Bernard Herrman's brilliant score--which easily doubles the film's effectiveness--would be incredibly remiss. If you want computer generated special effects, evil aliens, and lots of blood-letting, you should look elsewhere... but if you want something to think about, and something that will hold up under repeated viewings, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is strongly recommended.

A man comes to earth in peace to tell us we are threatening all other intelligent beings in the universe with our weapons of mass destruction and is met with violence. He proves that he is not of this planet, demonstrates to the world the power that could obliterate Earth in a frightening and convincing (but humane) manner, and tells us our warlike behavior will not be allowed to continue. This is an intelligent, well written, well produced film with extremely talented actors, including Oscar winner Patricia Neal. I find it entertaining, enjoyable, and thought provoking even after numerous viewings. (The Christian allegory [Mr. Carpenter] could have been omitted, though.)

443727,5,6302168465,"Maybe I'm just reading too much into this, but my take is this is a sci fi rendering of the Christ Story.  This fellow descends from the heaven's to preach a message of peace and ""love thy neighbor"" to us earthlings.  Initial response among earthlings?  Not too positive.  He's shot and locked away. He escapes and takes on a human identity (his name?  Mr. Carpenter!) and looks for local ""disciples"" to help him spread the word.  Finds a few but is still not going over well with the people at large.  Tries a miracle to get his point across-works with a few but still not catching on well with the local power structures. In fact, once they get their hands on him, they kill him.  Shortly thereafter, thanks to the application of some heavenly technology, he's resurrected, appears before his disciples and delivers his message and then ascends back into the heavens.
Of course, there are some liberties being taken here. He has a nominal love interest.  He's basically hiding out, not really working the crowds out in the open.  And he's brought help in the form of a large mechanical being.  So it's a very generalized rendering, yet an affecting one.  More of an effort to use the story as a sociological rather than a religious metaphor.  Nonetheless, I think it's that ""this all feels really familiar"" aspects of the story and plot that has a resonance with the audience.
The film is in black and white, so it has an authentic fell of the `50's.  The music score is authentic to the time as well. The acting is superb.  The technical effects, such as they are-and they are few and far between-are primitive by today's standards, but they are so peripheral to the story and the message that that doesn't become a factor insofar as enjoying the movie is concerned.
This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I watch it about once a year or so. I think it's will connect with a very wide audience.

One hidden area of fundamental intellectual thought in The Day the Earth Stood Still is hinted at in a very subtle manner by Michael Rennie's character.  It seems the ""space man"" uses diamonds for money (showing that even advanced races need a store of value and a means of exchange unlike the impossible premise of Star Trek that eliminates such currency), and that the fundamental programming of GORT is to punish those that initiate force. Further, the hero is able to judge each individual while, at the same time, commenting on the collective state of humanity (without describing the actual cause of humanities shortcomings).  The spaceman, in essence, is telling the people of Earth that once they step into the populated regions of space, they must not initiate force, and they can trade peacefully using a means of exchange that holds value.  Failure to do so on Earth results in our own destruction at our own hand.  Failure to do so in space results in our own destruction by a ""race of robots"".

443732,5,6302168465,"""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" was based on a short story by Harry Bates called ""Farewell to the Master"".  It doesn't take much insight to see that TDTESS is a variation on the Messiah story, complete with a scene of resurrection.  Note the name of the alien: Mr. Carpenter.  But, the connection is never forced on the viewer, and it forms the basis a very strong story of 1950's paranoia and distrust.  For me, TDTESS and ""2001, A Space Odyssey"" stand as the two finest science-fiction films ever made.
With Robert Wise as director -- who also made ""The Sound of Music"", The Sand Pebbles"", ""The Andromeda Strain"", ""West Side Story"", and more -- you get the care and attention of a skilled craftsman.  The score, by Bernard Herrman is outstanding, one of the first to feature the otherworldly sounds of the Theremin, which later on unfortunately became far overused in far-lesser films.  The original soundtrack is available on cd and very worthwhile.  Michael Rennie heads a cast of actors, each of whom holds his or her own.  Rennie stands out -- literally at a height of 6""4"" -- in his dignified and understated portrayal of the messenger from beyond.
A good story remains a good story no matter how old it gets.  Even though film effects have advanced drastically since 1951, Robert Wise used all the technology and talent available in his time to make an enduring cautionary tale which still speaks to us today.

This film was shot in Black & White AND it was originally shot in 4:3 aspect ratio.  There is NO widescreen version of this film available, so don't ask for it because it doesn't exist. The cinematography on this film was glorious B&W, and the DP knew how to use the B&W lighting and shadows to brilliantly frame and compose each shot.  Silhouettes, long shadows, rim lighting on faces that enhance they mystery...these are all aspects of a great B&W film.  Just ask Hitchcock.  Only an idiot would want this film to be released in color and, being released in Blu-Ray doesn't automatically mean a film has to be color or 16:9 widescreen.  Turner Broadcast ruined many B&W film classics by colorizing them.  It never paid off, but they needed to accomodate the simpletons who won't watch a B&W movie or TV.  This film is a classic.  Let's keep it that way.

My old VHS review:
This is, simply, a great movie! When a ""human"" alien visits earth, then takes up residence in a residential Washington D.C home, the issues of the movie becomes politically and socially focused when both the news media and neighbors alike begin describing what they think the alien looks like. Keeping in mind that the ""alien"" here looks like you and me, this movie beautifully illustrates how people everywhere develop a hysterical suspicion of everyone around them. With communism and racial issues being the important headlines of the day (mid-fifties) the writing in this film makes one think how they, themselves feel about these issues and makes one realize how really incorrect it is to judge someone based on a different belief, race or color. Heavy stuff for a '50's movie but still appropriate today. The ""special effect"" of this movie is Gort, the giant robot that serves as an unbiased, universally accepted police sentinel. It's great fun to watch him just stand in one spot and do almost nothing for most of the movie. People just panic, and in doing so, prove how stupid humanity really is.

To me, that isn't a well-thought message about peace and tolerance, that's a chilling tale of a master race that is willing to commit the ultimate form of barbarism for the sake of preserving their precious racial purity in space. And the arrogance of this film is that it expects us to accept that as good while taking us to task for the far lesser ""barbarism"" of fighting wars in the name of freedom and justice, as World War II and the Cold War struggle was.

Also like today, the scientists find it easier to meet on common ground than the politicians!  (Watch out for the cigarette smoking, though --- even the doctors light up in the hospital hallways!  Oh well, that's really how it was back in the 50s.  At the same time, it's neat to see all those ""classic"" cars and other props.)
 This film goes to show that special effects (of which this movie has relatively few) are not necessary for effective science fiction.  With good actors performing an excellent script, it doesn't really matter that the robot is a man in a rubber costume or the flying saucer looks a bit fakey when it first comes down to earth.  You soon get so caught up in the story, that it's easy to suspend disbelief and let it be real.  (I'm very glad they didn't colorize this, because the B&W lighting effects are a big part of the illusion.  Adding color would ruin it.)
 Precisely because the script doesn't go into much detail about how the spaceship works, it doesn't seem as dated as many other 1950s films.  The minimalist interior of the UFO simply suggests technology so far advanced,  that you can fill in explanations with your own imagination.  (Frankly, I like this approach much better than the constant technobabble in recent Star Trek episodes.)  Michael Rennie plays a highly intelligent alien who could be a forerunner of Spock (minus the pointed ears), and Sam Jaffe is just wonderful as the Einstein-like scientist whose unbridled curiousity and openess toward the unknown is a fine role model for us all.  This movie is true drama at its best!",979603200,68,1881,4.671732522796352
443806,5,6302168465,"This is the science fiction film for people who don't like science fiction.  Because of its reliance on an intriguing plot and superb screenwriting rather than sham special effects, the sci-fi aspects of the film seem to blend in seamlessly with other scenes.  Of course, special effects were limited in the year of its creation and that may not be a bad thing.  The effects that are present in the movie are still first-class in that they appear real.  We all know Gort is a man in a rubber suit, but he still seems real!  Rather than the usual dark cave for the spaceship interior, full of twinkling little lights, the interior of this ship is a model of Deco minimalism bathed in soft light!
I'm no real fan of science fiction, either in books or movies.  I've cherished this movie, though, for many years because of its combination of social moral and science fiction.  I recently showed this movie to my eleven year old niece and she was as captivated by it as I was at her age.

As a study in the history of film and a view of the standard thought of the 50's it is remarkable.  The space craft is approaching the earth at ""over 3000 miles and hour"" and the alien visitor says that he has come from ""billions of miles away.""  The  Doctors discussing the alien's rapid healing wound while chain smoking is an interesting view of the times of the film.

The ""Star Wars"" generation may find it a little slow, but that's probalby because of the drama and tension as the plot and  hunt for the ""spaceman"" unfolds. The 50s cold war is very much  part of the story. Special effects are dated, but still a great movie!",963446400,,351,4.46875
443861,5,6302168465,"This movie makes most of today's special-effects- heavy blockbusters look amateur. Everything is top notch in this one. Michael Rennie is very convincing as the alien visitor who shows compassion for the people of  Earth who are advancing too quickly in war technology for their own good.  Patricia Neal is also good in her role of mother to a son who spends time  with the mysterious stranger Mr. Carpenter. The special effects in this  film were beyond anything seen at the time and continue to be impressive to  this day, considering that this film was made in 1951. They are not too  flashy; they are subtle enough that viewers are not distracted and they  will actually make you think more about the power that the giant robot Gort  wields. The phrase ""he could destroy the world"" holds special  meaning when you see him melt weapons and revive the fallen Klaatu. This  film also has several amusing scenes, such as when Klaatu offers to pay to  see a movie. This one is also full of suspense. When the Earth stands  still, it's truly an impressive sight. On top of all of that, you have the  impressive soundtrack by the legendary Bernard Hermann. Buy this to see a  truly great example of film-making.

443862,4,6302168465,"This is one of the best and most intelligent Science-Fiction films of all time. At the time it was made, Cold War paranoia was rampant and the threat of 'the bomb' was more and more becoming a reality. And that is where this  film came along, it was made at a time when films 'tried to make a  difference' and burried beneath the metallic exterior of 'The Day The  Earth...' is a message, a message of peace, but put into sci-fi context;  aliens come to earth and warn 'Peace, or else...'. When you take a look at  all the pre-70's sci-fi films 'The Day...' stands out like a sore thumb, it  is one of the few that have stood the test of time and that continue to  captivate people of all ages. But the success of the film not only lies in  the material it also features an excellent cast. Michael Rennie is perfect  for the part, he has a coldness and a sense of absence of feeling that fits  perfectly. Robert Wise also directed with great assurance, adding timeless  elements, such as Gort the eight-foot indestructible robot and the  important message that Patricia Neal is give to save the earth from  destruction; Klatu...Barada...Nikto, those words linger in your mind long  afterwards. The metallic electronic score also adds to the effect. From a  scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!",961200000,,1293,4.512931034482759

It is always a pleasure to watch a science fiction movie that has a message and a good story, and does not need high tech special effects. Like the SR-71 Blackbird, it could  never be duplicated. All of today's modern high technology can never  improve on excellence.
A MUST for a science fiction video library.",959817600,,356,4.725806451612903
443864,5,6302168465,"Certain Directors can take cliches, spruce them up or even overcome them. Robert Wise is such a director. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is an example of Wise's art. Wise gives us a civilized alien, well played  by Michael Rennie, somewhat the proper Englishman, but in this movie seems  just perfectly cast as an ambassador of peace who warns the earth's leaders  what will happen if they don't stop the esculation of war making power. It  is a nice touch watching Rennie, head covered, emerge from his ""flying  saucer"" with what earthlings think is a weapon, so they shoot it out  of his hand and it turns out that it is a weapon of peace that could  prevent starvation. Patricia Neal is well cast and these type of movies  rarely gets this kind of casting. She believes in the alien and learns to  trust him. Another fascinating character is Gort, the Robot, who vaporizes  army tanks and reponds to his master's commands. Add to the excellent story  and suspense is the great music score of Bernard Herrman, composing an  exotic score that lifts this potentially average flying saucer flick to  greatness. A classic of the genre. Listen closely to the alien's language;  hundreds of people have used the command to Gort in conversation and in  other movies, even humorously in ""Army of Darkness."" Many would  call this too much of a ""message"" sci-fi movie, but it has too  much going for it to be just an ordinary message movie. It is one of a  handful of sci-fi flicks that hold up today, without resorting to an  overkill of computer generated special effects-the effects are good enough  here to tell the story of a civilized, lone ambassador stopping the world,  and making it think again about using atomic weapons,and just as  mysteriously as the saucer lands, the alien quietly walks back into his  ship, takes off, and leaves the earth to ponder whether to go to war again  or, as the deadly serious alien says,""be blown to cinders."" A  great sci-fi movie that can be viewed by the whole family.",958089600,7,2008,4.668571428571428
443865,4,6302168465,"""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is my all-time favorite sci-fi experience.  This is a movie where fine performances are extracted from ALL cast members with emphasis on Michael Rennie.  He is alternately subtle,  bemused, and does not suffer fools well.  The violence is minimized and is  only used to underscore the power of Gort.  If you're looking for an  abundance of gadgets and gizmos, this is not the movie for you.  It is  simply the story of an alien emissary telling us to get our act together.  The symbolism of the spacecraft landing in Washington makes a statement and  the hero worship bestowed on Klaatu by a young Billy Gray is touching.  The  glue that holds it together is Patricia Neal as we watch her intrigue  towards a handsome stranger segue to a deep felt respect for his earthly  mission.  Gort the Robot is truly terrifying although he does not have  ample screen time.  The eerie musical score by Bernard Herrman enhances the  production as it was one of the first sci-fi films to use the theramin for  the intense tonalities.  The film holds up well after almost fifty years  and it is truly the best of the thinking man's science fiction films.",956188800,11,1173,4.647058823529412
443906,5,6302168465,"The Day the Earth Stood Still was the first relatively modern film to show that Science Fiction and horror do not necessarily equate.  Unlike most of the genre at that time, and even today, TDTESS derives its strength not  from violence and destruction but from the then rather radical message that  peace and reason were superior to power and conquest.  The fact that the  message is delivered by alien ""invaders"" adds the magic of irony  and role reversal to the story.
Michael Rennie displays a marvelous  range of acting skills, ranging from patient forbearance to barely  concealed contempt, in his dealings with understandably cynical and  suspicious humans.  Patricia Neal fills a truly unique niche for the cinema  of the day, portraying an independent woman  with the intellect to think  for herself, the strength of character to say what she feels, and the  courage to take action when necessary.  Sam Jaffe is delightful as the  distinguished Professor Barnhart, who serves as the catalyst in allowing  Klaatu (Rennie) to present his message of  sober self-determination with  the potential for either enlightening or ominous consequences.
The  monster of this film is the robot Gort, also unusual in that he seldom  initiates any form of activity, but reacts decisively and often irrevocably  when provoked.  Another unusual twist is this thought-provoking movie is  that many of the mysteries surrounding Gort are never revealed.
Most  Sci-Fi of the early days either had no message, or the message was so  shallow and transparent as to be laughable.  The messages brought forth in  TDTESS are many and varied, both overt and subtle.  Among the most obvious  are that, while man holds his fate in his own hands, there comes a point at  which he is no longer in control of the consequences of irresponsible  action.  Another is that those we assume to be enemies are not necessarily  so, and those we determine to be friends may not always remain that  way.
Although The Day the Earth Stood Still is more than forty years old,  it remains a profound, effective gem of Science Fiction as relevant today  as it was in the early days of the Cold War.
This movie belongs in the  library of any true Sci-Fi enthusiast.",944611200,35,2225,4.9135135135135135

The two films share the same basic concept, however, in E.T.'s case, the entire motivation behind E.T. being on earth to begin  with is missing, whereas in TDTESS it acts as the main tension in the film.  In E.T., the alien becomes little more than a misunderstood pet, not  particularly intelligent or compelling, merely comforting.  Klaatu is a  living breathing entity with thoughts to express, a much more compelling  character as far as ""first contact"" with aliens go.  E.T. plucks  at the heartstrings in shamelessly obvious ways.  TDTESS is far more  restrained and somber, not sappy.
