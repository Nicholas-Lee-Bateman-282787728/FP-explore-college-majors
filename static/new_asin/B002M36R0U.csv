3951457,4,B002M36R0U,"My 2 yr old grandson loves this ... he's a huge Thomas fan.  The only thing I have to say is that each of the stories begins and ends with the famous Thomas music instead of just showing the story.  But it doesn't seem to bother my grandson..he's patient and knows ""other one comin'"" as he says.",1263081600,,295,4.157894736842105

I ordered the Thomas Spin & Fix Train along with the Thomas Hero DVD for $54.97
two or three days ago.
When I went back on line (Wednesday Dec. 16,2009)the Thomas Spin & Fix was reduced and now you can get the Thomas Holiday Express all three for $52.47.
I realize they have the right to do this but it's the timing that bothers me.",1260921600,,481,5.694444444444445
3951459,4,B002M36R0U,Product arrived in a timely manner and is excellent condition.  Thomas is my Grandson's favorite character.  We shop on Amazon together and he chooses the items to put in our wish list.,1260230400,,185,4.75
3951460,2,B002M36R0U,"I was disappointed because I assumed since this was a new DVD that it contained new episodes.  My son informed me that he had all the episodes except for one already.  At least he has a new train engine to play with. If you have a lot of Thomas DVD's already, there is probably nothing new for you on this one. :(",1258156800,12,313,4.032258064516129
3951461,2,B002M36R0U,This dvd isn't a new edition. Its an old version and I see that the toy comes with two magnetic clips on each side but nowhere can i find the other ones so that it can connect. Im really disappointed. My son loves the toy so much. I was really hoping that I could find the others so he can connect them,1257724800,,302,3.8870967741935485
3951462,2,B002M36R0U,"I figured that since this was a new release it would be like the new Thomas movie, ""Master of the Rails"", which my son and I both love.  But this is the old Thomas and this in itself would not be so bad if it wasn't a bunch of ten minute clips of holiday themed Thomas stories that begin with the opening music of the show and end with credits, only to begin again with the opening music and end again with more credits.  You get the point right?  If it wasn't for the free Take Along Holiday Thomas train that comes with it, I would have felt this a complete waste of my money.",1257638400,3,578,4.008695652173913
3951463,3,B002M36R0U,I agree with the other poster. There is nothing on the box to indicate which style of Thomas sets this works with. I'm glad we figured this out before we gave it to our son for the holidays.,1257552000,,190,4.026315789473684

8373500,1,B002M36R0U,DISAPPOINTED - THE TRAIN WASN'T INCLUDED. Upon delivery quickly noticed the train wasn't included. Just the DVD in its case only. Disappointed and returning it as the reason for purchase was to have the train for my Thomas the Train loving son.,1426896000,,244,4.833333333333333

8373504,5,B002M36R0U,"UPDATE: Learning Curve did a great job in handling this issue. I was told they may not have an exact replacement. I put a note in the box explain how important the train was to my son. Their first replacement was two zoo freight cars. Not even close. I emailed them, they sent me a shipping label and a short while later, we got not just the same train, but the entire package including a second DVD and a new winter train! My son hardly noticed it was gone and was quite happy to have the same item back! The magnets were put on correctly too!

Thanks Learning Curve!

This was one of the first Thomas DVDs we got for my son and therefore his first real introduction to the show. Since he had turned two not too long ago, this was among several things (other books and movies too) that helped us prepare him for Christmas. He loves the movies and loves to get involved and shout out during the movies!

The train however was a disappointment. A friend gave us her son's Gordon train and coal car. These were the only other Take-along trains we had. We noticed Winter Thomas didn't line up right. Sure enough the next time we went to her house, Winter Thomas didn't line up with anything there either. I twisted the engine around a few times and ways and realized the magnets aren't on there right. Now we have to come up with a receipt (I am sure the time code on the train is probably useless) to get it RMAed and hope they don't have a bunch of the same ones to replace it with.

We bought the last one at Target, so we couldn't exchange it there, and I'm not really fond of just returning it and trying to explain that it's broken.",1266364800,3,1635,4.230769230769231
