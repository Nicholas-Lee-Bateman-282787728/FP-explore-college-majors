8371002,5,B002IKVAG8,"""Good Eats"" scores another first when Vlad assists in ""In the Bulb of the Night,"" an episode devoted to garlic. I like all three of the episodes and found them all informative and entertaining, though I rarely eat fried food making ""Fry Hard 2"" not especially germane personally. ""What's Up Duck"" is interesting for those interested in either consuming quacking birds or thermodynamics; I fall more into the latter group. Of the three, however, I found the most entertaining and useful to be ""In the Bulb of the Night,"" as garlic is a great ingredient in cookery, but is one of the more challenging to use well. The set features one of Alton's greatest creations, ""Vlad's Very Garlicky Greens."" If you like greens (any kind, really) and garlic this is a preparation not to be missed.

This is another great presentation from Alton Brown, and I highly recommend it to poultry-minded cooks or Dracula completists anywhere.",1425081600,,920,4.897435897435898

Of the three, however, I found the most entertaining and useful to be ""In the Bulb of the Night,"" as garlic is a great ingredient in cookery, but is one of the more challenging to use well. The DVD comes with a recipe booklet that features one of Alton's greatest creations, ""Vlad's Very Garlicky Greens."" If you like greens (any kind, really) and garlic this is a preparation not to be missed. There are also duck and fried chicken recipes in the booklet, though I haven't made either, as well as ""40 Cloves and a Chicken,"" which serves as the poultry tie-in to the garlic show.

This is another great presentation from Alton Brown, and I highly recommend it to poultry-minded cooks or Dracula completists anywhere.",1425081600,2,1138,4.8061224489795915
