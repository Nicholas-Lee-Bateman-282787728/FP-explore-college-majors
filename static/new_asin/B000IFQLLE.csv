2655719,2,B000IFQLLE,"I know for some of you the sheer excitement of getting 2 disks of an old favorite tv show at such an amazing price is just too good to be true, isn't it? Well apparently, it is. If the 2006 in parenthesis didn't clue you in these 'Freaky Favorites' are picked from AYAOTD's Season 6, which was was the new cast after it's initial run was cancelled.

So like the other reviewer has stated, if you want the original cast and tales, goto amazon.ca and order it from amazon's canadian retailer. And write to Nick and tell them to release these classics in America, otherwise we're just going to keep giving those canucks our American money.",1171238400,51,636,4.482758620689655
2655720,5,B000IFQLLE,"This was my favorite show when I was a kid. I recently ordered the Season One set from Canada and found that I like the episodes as much today as I did long ago. Seasons One and Two of this series are undoubtedly the best; they have the most diverse array of unique, engaging stories with good dialog and acting. After Season Two, the series becomes derivative and disapointing. The show fell into a common trap: it began to immitate itself. The episodes in the Freaky Favorites collection are the first six episodes of Season Six. Keep in mind that Season Six is the first season of the revival series that aired about three years after the original. The quality of these episodes, as one might expect, is low; however, I recommend purchasing the Freaky Favorites set to show everyone that you are interested in the series. This could result in the U.S. release of the early seasons, the marvelous ones, which is what most of us truly desire.

All of you should make sure that you go to Amazon.ca and buy Season One! Pre-order Season Two as well! Canadian DVDs are Reagion 1, just like all DVDs in the U.S., so your player will definitely be able to read them. Also, shipping is faster than you might expect; I live in Chicago and it took Season One only a few days to arrive at my front door. Treat yourself to these amazing collections and spread the word!",1160438400,31,1359,4.479838709677419

2655725,5,B000IFQLLE,"Please know that this 2 disc set has ONLY a total of SIX episodes. I knew this when I bought it, but only because I read some reviews (# of episodes wasn't listed in description). I can't be disappointed, because frankly Goosebumps is packaged similarly.
I had set out to buy the complete series of AYAOTD but between living in US and apparently licensing difficulties, that won't be happening. Sad face.
Just as good as I remember. Costs way less than one trip to the movie theatre, and I already knew I'd enjoy it.
One last funny note- The outside of the case looks good, but when I flipped it open, the printing on the inside is backwards. All of it.",1389312000,2,653,4.404958677685951
2655726,4,B000IFQLLE,"I've been a ""Dark"" fan since it premiered on SNICK when I was 11.  It was my favorite live-action show back then.  I never saw the second series / cast until I recently started watching the show again online, and I strongly feel that these are underrated episodes.

The second cast is *different* than the first, and certainly lacks Gary's odd charisma and of course I miss my favorites Frank and Kiki, but these new kids (plus a startlingly grown-up Tucker) do a great job and bring their own vibe.  Tucker, if you can believe it, is even *nerdier* than Gary was, and Vange kind of picks up where Kiki left off.

The writing on these shows is really just as good as the *average* original-cast episode.  It's true that none of these are on the classic level of ""Laughing in the Dark,""  ""Prom Queen,""  or ""Old Man Corcoran,""  but these are solid scripts and well-acted, even the campy ""Gruesome Gourmets.""  I agree with the reviewer who said that the Tamagotchi-lampooning ""Virtual Pets"" probably should have been left off here, though -- that one is on the weak side, though it probably seemed very clever-topical at the time.

Back to the good part : you get the unsettling ""Forever Game,"" the heavy-handed but entertaining ""Misfortune Cookie,"" and one of the best villians ever in the A+ grade ""Zombie Dice.""  Plus the aforementioned ""Gruesome Gourmets,"" which has one of the best supporting characters ever in the meathead Chuck, not to mention a great semi-twist ending.  And the acting and production are at least as good, and probably somewhat better, than they were in the original run.

There are a few things that prevent this from being a 5-star set, and they are as follows :

1) ""Virtual Pets"" should have been swapped for a better episode.  The ""favorites, specially chosen"" rap on the package is jive, these are just the first six episodes of the sixth season.

2) The authoring and packaging on the DVD is pretty shoddy, though the functionality of the DVD is fine,

3) I feel like (and original prices for other ""Dark"" collections support the view that) they should have included more episodes for this price.  Especially the AWESOME 7th season posse three-parter ""Tale of the Silver Sight,"" or at least the rest of the 6th season. Come ON!

Those points aside, I still think this is a good value for getting some ""Dark"" in DVD quality (which beats streaming by a mile) and, as another reviewer pointed out, showing support for the series to increase the chances that more seasons will be reissued in the US at a decent price.

Finally, if you've avoided this set because the 2nd cast / series gets a bad rap, give these a try. Watch with an open mind, as you did back in the day, and you'll likely be as stoked as I was.  It's worth it!",1382313600,,2754,4.600409836065574
