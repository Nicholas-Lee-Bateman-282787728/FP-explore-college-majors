5690030,4,B00C3JUKHE,"By looking at the cover, one might assume this movie is a girlie feel good flick you might see on ABC family or the Halmark channel. I'm not sure why they chose to market the movie this way. It couldn't be further from the truth. It is a quirky little indie film with dark and mature themes, and is probably catered more towards men than women. My husband enjoyed the movie more than I (although I did really like it).

Beauty and the Least has something for everyone: romance, action, suspense, and comedy, although some of these are a bit more forced than others. By the photo chosen, I assumed the movie would be about Misha Barton. While I enjoyed her character, I was more drawn to Ben Banks and was much more invested in him as a person. I found the movie awkward and silly at times, but I remained invested in Ben's story throughout the movie's entirety. The ending was satisfying, although a bit predictable and cheesy. But it left me smiling. I've watched it more than once (actually, 4 times), so I'd say it's definitely worth watching.",1381536000,23,1046,4.505263157894737
5690031,5,B00C3JUKHE,"It was a great suspense, comedy and love story!!  I've watched it a few times and it just gets better each time!!",1376438400,2,113,4.136363636363637
5690032,4,B00C3JUKHE,"This is certainly a low budget production, and some of the acting, primarily by some of the secondary characters, is amateur. And, probably the worst thing about the movie is that it starts out slowly - verrrrrrrry slowwwwwwly. In fact, if someone with a busy schedule starts watching this, it is likely that they will give up watching it within the first 20 minutes. It just doesn't seem to go anywhere.
Still, with all of the things working against it, this turns out to be a delightful movie about good people doing the right things for the right reasons. If you stay with it, you will find yourself really caring about the main characters, and even some of the secondary characters.
So, it's not the best movie ever made, but those involved in it (both on-screen and off-screen) really put their hearts into it and made this movie for all the right reasons. By the end, you just feel really good, and that's reason enough to watch a movie.",1372118400,10,943,4.585798816568047

5690065,4,B00C3JUKHE,"This was intriguing and I""m left wondering how this Ben Banks guy got to play himself in the movie. He is awesome, I'm guessing that's part of the why. Most of the acting is not exactly on the scale of what I'm used to, but it was fairly interesting loved seeing Mischa Barton again. And been is super cute with the new look at the end.",1489276800,,336,4.106060606060606
5690066,5,B00C3JUKHE,"OK, so it wasn't a high tech Hollywood movie, but the story was very good. There were things like language, drugs and such to wade thru, but that was all part of the story. They weren't put there just for effect, but to set the stage for what was happening. I enjoyed the movie. It was funny, serious, touching, and kept our interest throughout. It is not a kid's movie. But we enjoyed it and would recommend it.",1488585600,,412,4.294871794871795
5690067,5,B00C3JUKHE,"I thought this movie was presented in a very endearing light. The music was great, the acting was great, and the subject is one that depicts real life events. I'm not sure what all the naysayers have a problem with. It had lightheartedness as well as nitty gritty reality. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and am appreciative of the opportunity to get to view it. Hope to see more from this filmmaker. Well done.",1488412800,,410,4.554054054054054
5690068,5,B00C3JUKHE,"Quite a nice movie--I was surprised.  I'm guessing it was produced or written or backed by the Mormons because there was a reference to a Bible story about the woman caught in adultery.  Ben Banks, the ""ne-er do well"" is refreshingly very believable as is Mishca Barton, the woman of his dreams.  This ranks up there with my favorite romance movies of all time.",1486598400,,361,4.609375
5690069,5,B00C3JUKHE,Pretty good. The title is very misleading. Interesting character study and good music.,1485820800,,86,5.6923076923076925

5690072,1,B00C3JUKHE,not at all what i expected. it was also disorganized in the story line. like it tried to cover too many topics.,1482019200,,111,4.090909090909091

5690094,2,B00C3JUKHE,"Not really a fan of this movie, but I did like the two main characters.  They weren't the typical Hollywood cookie-cutter types, not the ""rich girl"" or the ""bad girl"" or the ""pretty mean girl"" or the ""pretty girl-next-door"" or any other type, but more like real people.  That was the good part.  The rest was not so good.

It is FULL of crude humor, illegal drug use, references to condoms, sex, and porn throughout.  Violence is upheld as a valid way to respond to enemies or bad people.  The side characters are mostly stereotypical stupid sidekicks or beefy meatheads, etc.  The few times they have lines that are a ""message"" it is out of character (deliberately).  I think it is supposed to shock or surprise the audience.  I am not impressed with a church that turns out cretins like some of the characters in this movie.  They know enough scripture to tell stories from it to make a point, yet they don't know Jesus...they take illegal drugs and have sex and watch porn and discuss masturbation...oh, but, they aren't currently going to church, so maybe that's why...although the violent guy who beat people up (but they were bad people...) does attend church, apparently?  The guy who recommended burning down someone's house attends church--or Temple?

I believe the movie was meant to be  something about forgiveness, redemption, not judging others...but it really is very shallow in the way it depicts any of that.  Other than a few ""message"" lines about right and wrong, freedom, Jesus dying on the cross, etc., it's mainly a ""stoner makes good"" movie--though all the secondary characters remain stoners going nowhere, it seems.

There is a suicide in the movie, and several of the main characters take shrooms and are on their way to smoke weed during the scene where the suicide is discovered.  The effects of the shrooms are treated humorously in that scene and later on.

I almost did not watch past the first ten minutes because it was awful.  A bunch of stereotypical frat boy stoner dudes looking at porn, slacking off, and jacking off, basically.  There is a storyline eventually, including a romance, a simplistic blackmail plot uncovered for a newpaper article, and a simplistic subplot about a suicide note.

Although I liked the two main characters, it's a shame they were surrounded by such weak storylines, stereotypical characters, smut, and shallow messages.",1480896000,,2385,4.9002493765586035

5690127,4,B00C3JUKHE,"After reading reviews, including one by the film's director, I decided to give this movie a shot.  This isn't one I would watch with kids because the themes deal with drugs, death and the porn industry.  I actually really liked this movie.  As another reviewer mentioned, the cover picture and abbreviated title are a bit misleading since this movie is focused on a guy named Ben.  The main characters are all ""stoners"" or have had past addictions and especially the first 30 mins spends a lot of time setting themes and character insights with talk about sex, drugs and porn.  There is no actual sex or porn shown.  Pics of sexy girls in lacy underwear are shown but have direct relevance to the telling of the story, as well as a scene in which both men and women are creatively ""clothed"" (skimpy, not naked). There is some talk about ""going back to church"" as a solution for problems and a retelling of New Testament scripture, but it wasn't overly annoying to me.  I was annoyed by the music, which I found distracting instead of complementary to the movie (too loud?  Not my taste? Still not sure).  Even with that, the story is meaningful and worth watching as long as you go in kind of knowing what to expect: a sometimes funny, but real look at someone who needed to change their life and then actually does it.",1468022400,5,1319,4.531645569620253

5690146,5,B00C3JUKHE,"Enjoy Ben's journey to redemption, as Bryce put it. There is nothing to be offended about on here so enough of the lame reviews. This is a fun film that most of us young adults can relate to: college, soft drugs with our friends, and coming into our own after college. At some point in my life I felt like Ben, stuck in the pit of student life and the eternal curriculum, wondering if there is a finish line and something to be proud of. Bryce delivers genuine content, which is difficult to come across nowadays, especially when there is romance. Don't read to much into the movie, looking for things to pick at because you will miss how refreshing and hilarious it is. It feels good to think for a moment that there are others like us who get lost in the process of transitioning into adulthood, but later find themselves ready to take on the real world.",1465862400,4,856,4.389937106918239

5690149,5,B00C3JUKHE,"This little sleeper may start slow and seem like a stoner flick, but while a few stoners figure prominently in the movie, that is a major part of the whole plot. It is a congealed amalgam of self realization, atonement, and spiritual rebirth in a very low key offhand way. Throw in a little love story, offbeat humor, and the good guy winning in the end, and you have a pleasant, well acted respite from the gawky oversexualized drama of most movies. No senseless violence, gratuitous nudity here, just good acting. When it was over, I truly appreciated the ""art"" involved in the making of this little gem.

5690160,4,B00C3JUKHE,"I liked this movie, except for the shout out to Mormonism. It showed that in religion there is some judgment as evidenced by comments made by the 2 stars of the movie. This is not ""redemption inside Mormonism"" (comment by the movie's director). the redemption of the two main characters is outside of active membership. Their church membership has nothing to do with their redemption. To redeem something means to purchase. The only redemption comes through the shed blood of Jesus Christ through which he paid the price of our sins. So, yes, the movie seems to say that the answer lies in going back to church. Church can't save you no matter what name you call it. God can through Jesus Christ. Being religious doing good works doesn't save you no matter how many callings and if your temple recommend is up to date. As far as I can tell, the main characters did not put their trust in Jesus Christ, though Ben is going back to church which would make him religious only...Religion without a relationship with God basking in His presence, is just a man made set of rules and teachings: do this, don't do that. The life of our Holy God is through His word the Bible and in His son Jesus Christ who is not a spirit brother to Lucifer who is an angel a created being whereas Jesus always existed but was incarnated in the flesh and lived on this earth.",1456272000,,1351,4.473684210526316

I love the fact that the hero was no super hero or perfect guy (may not have even been functional actually).  But he rose above his own limitations and fought for the person he loved.  He loved his neighbor as himself-- a true hero.  I don't care so much about production quality. I simply loved the heart in this film.",1452816000,,564,4.194444444444445

This movie is about stoners or dudes looking for an escape and the writer put a twist at the heart of a successful flow of things...a heart knocking example of what a Man called Jesus should have been doing above all others (accusing the woman - because he had to die because of what she did.) I don't consider myself less sanctified or more Holy than anyone... but I was watching this movie because it seemed a little less corrupt of most of the other movies out now.

The execution by the actors is another thing entirely. Long silences after a line delivery aren't anything new but, here in this movie it comes across as lack of writing skill.

I walk away knowing absolutely nothing about Mormons. Sorry Bryce, I wanted to sit thru the whole thing to be fair. But you lost me. In your next work, I urge you to really delve into making characters interesting and losing the fluff dialogue. You reference Pulp fiction - which is one of my top favorites. Why - because the characters breathe texture. While I respect that you are making this movie thru the lens of the modern Mormon and the struggles.

I thought maybe he was so disillusioned by the generalizations about cavemen that he dropped out. So it was good to see he is acting and not depressed, contemplating suicide in Malibu. I added one star just for that in my review.  So he gets a haircut and they shave him. It wasn't two scenes later his beard started growing back. I think it might be hypertrichosis. I don't know. Good thing the other blond girl had an English accent. At first I thought it was the coffee shop/porno girl. The VW Van was cool. They're expensive when they're restored like that. I suppose I should talk about the movie. It was slow in the beginning. I enjoyed it though. The acting by the 2 guys at the motor home place (Hey! They looked the same too!) was lame. I think the biggest problems I had was how fast the whole movie wrapped up. It was nice how everything tied in together, but the last scene was a little cheesy.  The main guy Ben came off as co-dependent and the ""I'm going to church"" thing seemed tacked on. Worse than that, the preachy speech about Jesus didn't fit. I think I would have toned that down or had him go to church at his low point and hear the minister say that. At the end, I would have had the two main characters have a little dialogue and only go as far as saying they want to try to make it work. I guess Ben and his friends will have to buy some software to get all that porn off their computers. BTW, the porn guy looked suspiciously like the famous Ron Jeremy. Not that I know who he is, some friends told me about him. Haha. Finally, I really liked the idea of the ""boys"" mulling over all their problems together.
