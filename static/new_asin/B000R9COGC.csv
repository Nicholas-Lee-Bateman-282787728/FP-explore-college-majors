Fatty and his girl are walking in the park. A young girl leaves her distracted nurse and walks along the lake, then slips and falls in. Fatty goes into the lake to rescue the girl, who happens to be the Police Commissioner's child. Fatty is offered a job. [Government work pays steady.] He sees two men fighting and tries to stop them. Then he takes a rest. Five boys act up, one throws a pie, and they all run away. Fatty tries to wash up. [Note the men's bathing suit.] Those boys fool with Fatty's clothes. Another boy finds Fatty's coat and takes it to the police station. They think Fatty has drowned! Two women report a half-dressed man at large in the park. They search the lake, the boat capsizes! The police mourn their loss. Two cops bring Fatty back to the police station. Fatty has a lot of explaining to do. He winds up behind bars. From hero to zero?
