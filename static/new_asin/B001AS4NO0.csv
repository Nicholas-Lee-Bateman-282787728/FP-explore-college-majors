8279330,5,B001AS4NO0,"I really prefer not to review products. It's sufficient to say that I'm elated to have this rare insight into an enigmatic man and Supreme Court Justice-- Antonin Scalia. Charlie Rose is a master, one of the rare few who does in-depth research and brings his knowledge to the interview that probes beneath many misconceptions, beyond type-casting judges as liberals or conservatives. The American Constitution is the main character here. That's why I ordered this DVD. I have ordered Scalia's book, ""Making Your Case, The Art of Persuading Judges,"" as a result.

8279331,4,B001AS4NO0,"Charlie Rose speaks with Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia on judicial philosophy, the character of the present day Court, some of the judgments of Justice Scalia, on his background and education. Justice Scalia is straightforward, blunt, strict. His judicial philosophy is called 'Originalism' and focuses on a strict adherence to the original meaning of the Constitution. It is opposed by the judicial philosophy which Scalia calls 'Consequentialism' a philosophy which focuses on the social result of the ruling.
There are some surprising insights in the talk. Justice Scalia says for instance that it is not the Supreme Court which most determines what happens in the everyday life of Americans, but rather other more local courts. Justice Scalia appears to be a decent, principled Judge. He is the first Judge of Italian , actually Sicilian origin, on the Supreme Court. He is along with Clarence Thomas considered to be one of the most Conservative judges on the Court.
I perhaps quite naively supposed that the task of the Court was to do precisely the opposite of what Justice Scalia suggests i.e. to read the original principles as guiding principles in help making rulings which will be of benefit to present American society. I in my own mind think of Justice Scalia's view as a kind of literalism, fundamentalism which is not really the wisest of all policies.
Justice Scalia is clear, strong and determined. He is not a man , at least in this interview, of verbal brilliance or humor.
While the conversation was informative it did not stir to great interest.",1214438400,,1574,5.0344827586206895
