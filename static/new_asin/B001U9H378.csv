3797392,1,B001U9H378,"My husband is Italian and was concerned that our 2 y/o wasn't picking up Italian fast enough, especially since all the shows he watches are in English, so I bought these thinking they would help. Major flaw in these DVDs is that they clearly do not use a native Italian speaker. The accent is all wrong with emphasis place in the wrong place in words and sentences. Even I noticed the problems and I am not fluent at all. I think we will be better off finding an Italian cartoon on You Tube rather than showing these to our son.",1384387200,12,528,4.29
3797393,4,B001U9H378,"Simple easy to follow video information that even an adult can use to learn Italian a little.  The DVD's require having the TV on, so it's a little more difficult to use them than CDs.",1383782400,,184,4.257142857142857
3797394,5,B001U9H378,"These DVDs were purchased for my two grandchildren, ages 3 and 5, who already understand and speak some Italian, as this is their heritage through their mother.  My daughter-in-law reports that the children are learning and that she is also and that she enjoys listening to them practice.  She is very happy with the set.",1383350400,,321,4.818181818181818
3797395,5,B001U9H378,The visuals are great and easy to understand. This educational tool will help with Italian as a second language. I will definitely recommend this to family and friends.,1374796800,2,168,5.035714285714286
3797396,5,B001U9H378,"My husband is a native speaker of Italian, and usually only speaks/reads/ sings to her in Italian, so she's at an advantage. We strongly believe that these DVDs have helped reinforce her growing Italian vocabulary. We are thrilled with them, as is our now 15 month old who has been watching them on average 1-2xs a week for about 4-5 months. (They were a life saver on a long flight to visit Nona in Italia this summer!!)

They are well produced. The videos show children doing a variety of day to day activities such as eating, playing, and going to school. The music is fun, gentle and upbeat (a plus with me considering how often I have to listen to it) with short bits of cute animation that support each lesson. Finally, my daughter is madly in love with Pim. She now even sleeps with a stuffed Panda. If he's nowhere to be found at bed time, it's a crisis ;-). These DVDs are a huge hit in our household!",1351814400,2,910,4.352941176470588
3797397,5,B001U9H378,"My daughter has been watching this video series a few times a week for several months now and she loves it! She asks for ""Pim Mama, Pim!"". While she still often chooses to say an English word instead of the corresponding Italian one, she understands what my husband is saying to her when he speaks Italian. When he asks her to do something for him (in Italian) like ""go get the apple for Papa"", etc. she responds appropriately, demonstrating her comprehension. I think that when she gets a bit older (she is 22 months now), she will speak more Italian.

My only complaint is that you cannot SEE a person speaking. It is just a voice over. This video is teaching her what the words sound like, but it is not showing her what a mouth looks like when making that sound. Also, it would be helpful to have many more voices so that she can hear what the words sound like when spoken by a man, a woman, a child, etc.",1318204800,19,909,4.284883720930233
3797398,4,B001U9H378,"My 17-month old daughter loves this DVD set and will ask for the Panda almost daily.  The videos of the children and parents doing everyday things like eating, drinking and playing immediately resonate with her.

I'll confess, I sometimes use it to teach her the English words rather than the Italian, but it's an enjoyable set.",1253232000,7,328,4.839285714285714
3797399,4,B001U9H378,"We tried Muzzy (zero interest level) and so far, my son wants to watch the eating and drinking dvd with the panda over and over. I think he must be picking up on some Italian words b/c he remembers most words he hears.  I need to reinforce it a bit myself by using the language if I want it to stick.",1241654400,7,300,3.918032786885246
8343182,3,B001U9H378,We bought these because my son wanted to study Italian.  So we bought these.  The videos are for much younger children and were kind of cheesy.  My three year old enjoyed them but they were not for my 8 year old son.  So if you have a preschooler and need something kind of educational and fun to watch it's a good movie.  But if you are looking to really learn a language keep shopping.,1442448000,2,387,4.175675675675675

8343184,5,B001U9H378,"My kids are ages 5, 4, and 2 years old. I purchased this set to help them learn Italian. It is a cute video and keeps their attention. The high-pitched voice is attractive to young ears, and the cartoon is not too fast and flashy for young eyes. I recommend it!",1440201600,,261,4.137254901960785

8343188,4,B001U9H378,"I am mother tongue Italian, and I bought this product to have a little help on the side with teaching my daughter Italian since my husband doesn't speak it.

PROs:
- My daughter loves watching these videos over and over. They are almost always on in the background even if she is playing with another toy.
- They work! Her Italian has seen a nice boost since these DVDs arrived.

CONs:
- The voice is NOT mother tongue Italian. Sometimes the pronunciation is incorrect.
- Sometimes there are ""mistakes"". For example, an Italian would hardly say ""Il cane scuote la coda."", he/she would rather say ""Il cane scodinzola."" The former sentence is grammatically correct but not idiomatic. Another mistake I caught is ""Lui prepara il tavolo"" when it should have been ""la tavola"".

Overall I am happy with the product and I hope that in the future the creators decide to consult and use mother tongue Italians to improve the quality.",1410307200,9,924,4.726708074534161
8343189,4,B001U9H378,"My 4 month old son loves it. And so does my 7 and 9 year old. It has English subtitles so they can read what it says but I wish the people said some of the words so my 4 month old can see movement of lips. Overall, they are really good DVDs and has a repeat play option",1409270400,,269,3.5762711864406778
