8120346,3,B000FBHCMI,"Other reviewers have rehearsed the plot of Edward Killy's RKO B-Movie from 1940, so there is no need to tread over familiar ground. What is perhaps more intriguing is the way the film rehearses several themes characteristic of the western, which might tell us something about the way America viewed itself at that time. The film is awash with movement: the wagon train traveling across the plains, accompanied by riders; the perpetual threat of the bad guys wanting to stop the train; coupled with the subplot about a community's livelihood being threatened should vital food supplies not arrive. This draws attention to the idea of the pioneer spirit; the fact that, as a young country, the United States is perpetually looking to expand itself; it is never satisfied with staying n one place. WAGON TRAIN also embodies racial attitudes characteristic of that time: all the characters are Euros, save for one Mexican (Julian Rivero) who assumes a peripheral role as he is s seen entering the general store trying to buy some beans for his family. He cannot afford the exorbitant price; and hence throws them back in the seller's face. Native Americans are represented as savage; they destroy one settlement; and it is only because of our hero Zack Sibley's (Tim Holt's) cleverness that they allow him and his followers to pass through their territory unscathed. By contrast the 'good' white Euros are represented as strong yet fair, believing in the importance of group identity as a means to survive in an inhospitable landscape. The film packs a lot into its sixty-minute running time; comedy, adventure, even two songs (with music by Paul Sawtell). Not particularly memorable, perhaps, but an interesting historical document.",1402790400,,1729,5.091549295774648
