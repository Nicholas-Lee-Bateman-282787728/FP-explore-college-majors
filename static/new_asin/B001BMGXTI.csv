3493881,5,B001BMGXTI,"Forget what anyone says about the packing, that isn't what you're buying.  You're buying the show.  To be honest I downloaded it rather than mess with the dvd.

Anyway this is an excellent series.  One of the better ones on TV (and there aren't that many).  The writing is unique and Kyra Sedgwick does a great job at portraying a cop who is good at their job, but not her life.

Add in some good acting from the others in the show, and you have something that is worth watching.  I recommend it.",1219104000,,496,4.268817204301075
3493882,1,B001BMGXTI,This video is letterboxed inside a SD sized area on an HD screen.  Very disappointed.  Needs to be widescreen.,1216771200,7,110,4.7368421052631575
3493883,1,B001BMGXTI,The show was good.  Exactly what I would expect from a 4th season show.  What is horrible about this 'product' is the Unbox feature used to d/l and view it.  The Unbox help menu is very limited and there is no way to stage the videos waiting in quene.  Those are small flaws.  The major flaws are 1. d/l time is pathetic.  Almost a hour for the the approx. 45 min. show and 2. I can't import or play this on an ipod product.  The only reason I purchased this episode was it was not on iTunes like last season.  I hope iTunes does eventually carry this season because The Closer on Amazon Unbox is a giant step backwards.,1216252800,7,620,4.151260504201681
3493884,5,B001BMGXTI,"I love this show! Kyra Sedgwick is finally getting her just deserved! Please don't change any of the characters relationships. I love the chemistry just the way it is. Don't make the mistake of changing how the characters interact with each other. My other favorite show did and now I don't know how long I'm am going to continue to watch it. So, please, please , please, don't change a thing!!! I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!!",1216080000,13,419,4.6
3493885,5,B001BMGXTI,"Satisfying without being condescending, this is to most TV fare as frozen entres are to Cordon Bleu cuisine. This tightly written episode coaxes dimensional characters out of what in lesser hands would be pancake-flat caricatures, and twists viewer sympathies and suspicions as adroitly as Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson - the Closer herself - manipulates situations.
  From the grainy opening footage interspersed with episode credits, nothing is as it seems at first glance - or second or third, for that matter. As the show begins, we find ourselves both participants in and voyeurs to the drama unfolding, itself a deceptive wraparound embodying the theme of appearance versus reality. The attendant irony of such a theme set in Hollywood is too delicious not to be deliberate. This, too, would be unbearably trite if handled less expertly, for all the ingredients are stock, red herrings notwithstanding: the assertive female, the ingenious sidekick, the overbearing boss, the locked-room-with-dead- (well, almost all dead) occupants.
  Yet there's nothing yawn-inspiring about this treatment, where standard ingredients are swirled into an embarrassment of riches to surprise the senses, and we find our sympathies engaged along with our intellect.
  So what if we can't exactly follow how honey-tongued Brenda arrives at her jawdropping deductions? No dishonor in that; she abandons carpool lanes for the corporate jet, budget cuts be damned, and we're all for it, though we fear the price for such daring. Like a skilled magician, Brenda has distracted us too successfully for us to track what she's really up to. That's part of the fun, and in the end, part of the joke is revealed to be on her, anyway. The main thing is, the joke is not on the viewer, for a welcome change - and that's a treat to be savored, albeit one that could turn into a craving.",1214611200,2,1859,5.098684210526316

3493895,5,B001BMGXTI,I was watching this show then I notice the man named Provenza looks very familiar and like Omgoodness he is the man from the police academy I can't think of his name but that he always yelled.

She is tuff as nails but can be sugary sweet Southern Belle if the project warrants it.  She is a CIA trainned interigator now working for the LAPD.  The Comedy is supplied by  her two senior Lieutenants played by Tony Denison and G.W. Bailey.  At least once a season a whole show is dedicated to their comedic antics at solving crimes especially murder.  Romance is provided by her FBI husband.",1474934400,,558,4.760416666666667

I now own all seven seasons of ""The Closer"" and these shows are my first ""go to"" when nothing is on TV worth watching....which is most of the time.  All the actors in this show deliver their own unique humor and/or drama to the series.  The show is a balance of everything a TV show should be for family entertainment.  Another great series on TNT was ""King and Maxwell"", which only lasted one season before not being renewed.  Don't understand that one either as it was canceled before most people had a chance to discover it.  Also great characters in that show including Jon Tenney who also played Kyra Sedgwick's husband in ""The Closer"".  He was fantastic in both series.",1450137600,,839,4.509933774834437

3494098,5,B001BMGXTI,I absolutely enjoy watching the Closer.  Those characters fit so well with my personality and the work environment I had with great co-workers until I retired.  We used to banter each other and make cynical jokes and remarks about situations we were exposed to on a daily basis.  It helped us keep our sanity in an ugly real world.  We were a close group and we worked to top efficiency together.  A team that was fluid.  And that's what I experience with this show.  Thanks to all the characters for each of their character parts....you play them so well.,1424390400,,556,4.555555555555555

3494119,5,B001BMGXTI,"The characters are complex. The plot lines are realistic, at least as far as how the characters interact. Even the difficult members of the police force do something right from time to time. Sometimes the plot line is telegraphed, but most of the time there is a twist and a surprise. Even so some things are reassuringly consistent: Deputy Chief Brenda will always want to eat chocolate, will always misplace something she needs, will easily lie to and deceive people being interrogated. Her intuition is legendary. I really like the way that the scripts do not follow a timetable: Two minutes into the program some one dies. Each 10 minute segment has the newest suspect who proves not to be the right person.",1424390400,,711,4.788617886178862

3494159,4,B001BMGXTI,"This series tells the story of police protection from the perspective of the police.  What I like about this season is that the stories inform citizens who have had to interact with the police recognize what their job involves and it does not include holding your hand while they determine if you are a suspect (all loved ones are suspects). Brenda, the chief investigator, even says ""I wish there were a better way."" The show is for intelligent people to recognize the moral dilemma when Brenda says as a truism, ""If we do not lie [to the one we are interrogating] we will never get to the truth!"". I sense the continuity between the seasons as it builds with greater understanding and then communicates the complexity of dealing with people when looking for a criminal. I am looking forward to season 5 and hope to see more of the female character who investigates every time a policeman kills a civilian. She is hated by many, appreciated by few and MUST be a regular on the show to provide the tension between civilians and police that is so poignant now in 2014.",1419033600,,1067,4.5863874345549736

Some episodes are almost comical, with Provenza and Denison as the bungling stars, except that one must bear in mind that a crime has been committed. Other episodes focus on the tragedy, the poignant side of crime, when it personally affects team members such as Sanchez who's East LA neighborhood is the haunt of gangs.

Most of the episodes contain homosexual characters and situations, which just doesn't happen that frequently in real life...even in L.A. Unless, of course, the pathology of homosexuality manifests itself in increased criminal activity above that of the rest of the normal population - which may, upon further reflection, be valid.

3494320,4,B001BMGXTI,"I didn't catch onto this show when it was on air, mostly because the first season was so over-the-top feminist caricature.  However, watching it on Amazon, every season humanizes the cast and places Brenda in a more realistic and appealing role--a damn smart and driven woman who nevertheless has all the normal female (human?) vulnerabilities that actual smart and driven women have in the real world.  I think the show is a good set piece for female leadership in the work place, but that aside, it's pretty entertaining--comic at times, intense at others.  My only complaint is the formulaic approach where complex crimes are always solved in 48 hours or less.",1407110400,,663,4.954954954954955

3494330,5,B001BMGXTI,"The Closer with Kyra Sedgewyck was a favorite crime show of mine. I hated to see it end. I watch the reruns over and over. The uniqueness of the show centering around Deputy Chief Brenda Lee Johnson matching wits with suspects to get confessions was mesmerizing at times, funny at times, angering at times, but always entertaining. The casting of the detectives she worked with couldn't have been better, such camaraderie, such devotion, sometimes tension but always the ultimate in respect.  What can I say, it's a standout show.",1406419200,,530,4.955056179775281
3494331,5,B001BMGXTI,"Finally began watching the closer a month ago - unfortunately now it has been cancelled.  Really really clever show.  Gets a bit silly at times but once you have allowed the characters to develop, you can enjoy their silliness as well.  Great mix of characters and great writing.

3494383,5,B001BMGXTI,"This show has excellent writing and acting. There's also a little bit of humor that usually appears in each episode that takes the edge off the horrible crimes being investigated or the internal pressure that often comes down on Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. The Closer incorporates many of the nuances that occur with a woman heading a former bastion of male power. I like the play between Brenda and her boss because she is not politically savvy and gets straight to the point and, consequently, often ruffles egos and her boss often soothes those egos. The Closer shows Brenda as a workaholic yet  succeeds at making her a whole human being with a personal life and other (albeit, limited) interests, not a cliche.",1399507200,,716,4.821138211382114

3494427,5,B001BMGXTI,"I don't know where to start with my love for this show. The way she works all of the suspects, convincing them to confess is astonishing. She is so strong and forceful, yet so flawed that it creates the perfect character. I couldn't think of a more talented, beautiful, and intelligent woman to play the role of Brenda Leigh Johnson than Kyra Sedgwick. I love her <3!!!! I love the relationship between her and Fritz. The way she can come home and pour her heart put to him and the way they love each other even though their flaws might seem horrible. For example, in Season 4 Episode 1 ""Controlled Burn"", Fritz and Brenda are in their new house,(6 weeks after moving in they are still packed in hopes of finding a better place). Fritz notices that Brenda is stressed out and comes over to her with open arms inviting her into a hug. I thought that this showed that even though she had just yelled at him and they got into a small argument, that he has to be there for her. If there was no romance between 2 characters like there is with Fritz and Brenda, I do not think that this show would be as amazing as it is.  Brenda Leigh Johnson is a role model to me. The Closer is definatley worth watching.",1393372800,,1201,4.290748898678414

i really liked that I was made to feel that the characters were real people.  With real problems. Many popular programs are made up of actors that are so perfect I find it difficult to believe what I am watching.  The Closer  has chosen a cast that will show characters with messy morning hair - smudged makeup to fit the scenes.  Offensive character traits exposed - More realistic!

3494435,5,B001BMGXTI,"There are some shows that are so great that you only need to watch them once, but you still remember how each episode's plot goes, even years after the show ends. This is one of these shows.

I really enjoyed this show and I was so sad when it ended. Sedgwick's performance as Brenda Leigh Johnson was amazing. In the pilot, you're introduced to this older woman who pops out of nowhere to become one of the highest ranked woman in the LAPD, and the head of a department. Most of the people around hate her, including her own squad. I like how the seasons catalogued Brenda's struggle with respect for her skills in the LAPD to earning the wholehearted loyalty of her squad and how she develops personally as well.

Another thing that made me like Brenda so much was how she owned up to her bitchiness. She's a deeply flawed character (i.e. hypocrite, liar, control freak, workaholic, rude, inconsiderate, and sometimes vigilante). There were times when I even wanted to reach into the screen and shake the character for being who she is, which can be hurtful to the people around her. However, that's ultimately who Brenda is. She is also compassionate, kind, and determined. For me, Brenda's flaws are what makes her real, I don't like how female leads on TV and movies are often criticized/demonized if their characters are considered too weak/flawed (but there's a lot less criticism for their male counterparts). Despite all of her flaws, you still ultimately root for her.

On a side note, the regulars on the show have really great on screen chemistry, although it would have been nice to see another female squad member after Daniels left. Flynn and Provenza are a great comedic duo, but I would never want to meet their real-life equivalents in any law enforcement officers.",1392422400,,1783,4.745161290322581

3494437,5,B001BMGXTI,I can't think of a series I've enjoyed as much as this one.  The back stories stay where they belong -- in the back -- yet are an integral part of each episode.  I'm moving on to Season 5.,1392336000,,188,3.7948717948717947
3494438,5,B001BMGXTI,"Brenda's techniques of obtaining confessions remains very effective and have application to any negotiation situation, whether criminal or not. The re reappearance of the arson killer who helps catch the fireman killer shows a villian as evil as
Hannibal Lectur - definitely someone that one would not ever want to be around. Brenda's and Fritz's relationship develops  and Fritz shows that he can battle Brenda when necessary.

She picks up this series and rams it through year after year just as hard and fast as possible.

The crime scenes and investigations seem realistic enough to sell the story and the characters are very convincing.  I find the character of Brenda very charming and endearing.  She depicts a traditional southerner in a very high spirited and fast moving big city.  Even though she has a southern drawl she is intelligent and knows how to produce confessions by the book.  Each character is true to form for the person they are playing.  Brenda, the main character ,along with the other characters are an interesting mix who show plenty of on screen chemistry.  So far each character has played sensitive and moving experiences that are not only well played but the character stays true to itself.  Every episode is jam packed with a super well written story and excellent camera shots and filming locations.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great friendship, love and family story and crime investigation shows.",1383091200,,1061,5.017142857142857

3494547,5,B001BMGXTI,"When I got rid of my cable 5 years ago the only show I couldn't live without was ""The Closer"".  I love Brenda's quirky personality and all of the other team members as well.  I was so sad when it went off the air, but now I watch Major Crimes.  Not quite as good without Brenda, but at least most of the other cast members are still there & it is growing on me.  :)",1375833600,,365,3.8266666666666667

3494552,5,B001BMGXTI,Kyra Sedgwick is fantastic as the southern addition to the LAPD Major Crimes division. I love the relationship among all of her division. The acting is wonderful! I will be so sad when I finish watching all seven seasons!!,1375315200,,222,4.717948717948718

3494555,5,B001BMGXTI,...and that is saying something when you are talking about a series as good as this one. The comedy and the tragedy all work and there are some truly incredible performances.

3494559,5,B001BMGXTI,"The Closer introduces Kira Sedgewick as the new head of the Major Crimes Division.

The group of almost all male detectives put her through the paces, but she pushes back in gentle ways, always using her southern charm to calm a situation. The men learn to respect her as they watch her in action -- closing the deal, so to speak. Brenda gets perps to confess by expertly sidling up to them with that southern charm, disarming them. Then, like the snap of a southern gator, she latches onto the lie, the statement that doesn't match, or the arrogance of the criminal and twists them in a verbal death roll taking them down and closing the case.

This is an excellent crime drama with a heart -- and a bite! Watch this, and you'll be hooked!!",1374451200,,741,4.4411764705882355

I love that every character is well-drawn and that they work together so well as a team.  I do understand that there has to be conflict to keep a viewer's attention, but, I love the fact that the tension is with the criminal, not with other team members.  A fabulously written, smart, character-driven show and each of the characters is a joy to watch.",1374364800,,458,4.560975609756097

Kyra Sedgwick's role in this series is both disapproving and applauding. She is ""Assistant Chief"" of her domain, but she is definitely human.  I am now on the last episide of Season 7 and wonder, ""Where do I go from here?""",1373068800,,387,4.594202898550725

3494579,5,B001BMGXTI,Complex and complicated.  Brenda Leigh always gets the perp one way or another--usually by misleading the ciminal.  she has a great team and they all work together to solve the cases.

In a cliffhanging episode 10, ""Time Bomb"", the poor guy takes three bullets in the back and flies away in a copter bleeding in Brenda's arms. Next episode, he is all smiles and Brenda is in a wedding gown grinning ear to ear. Huh? This is insulting and disappointing. Continuity out the window, along with my respect for  the show. Just Awful. You lost a fan, but unlike Sanchez' miraculous return, at least I gave you an explanation. A bunch of kids with a camera. Shame on you.",1367366400,,524,4.458333333333333

I gave it five stars for the acting, drama, comedy and story lines.  Brenda Leigh is endearing; I like her un-selfconsciousness and willingness to look silly.  Kyra Sedgwick is a fantastic actress.  I'd love to see more of her.",1367107200,,379,4.582089552238806

3494646,2,B001BMGXTI,"Brenda Leigh Johnson is one of the most objectionable female characters I've seen in a long time.  She seems like a ""strong woman,"" but in actuality is just cruel, manipulative and selfish. Having this kind of female character on television has a negative impact on society because it implies that being a strong woman means being crappy to men.

No thank you.",1366934400,3,360,4.790322580645161

3494660,4,B001BMGXTI,"I like the closer be cause Brenda is unique.  She thinks out of the box.  She has issues both personal and work related. Can the show be too graphic?  Yes! It is not a kid friendly show. As with all things some will like it and others will hate it. But if you like drama and police techniques give it a shot, you may be one of the ""I like it"".",1365465600,,343,3.8028169014084505
3494661,5,B001BMGXTI,"While The Closer was consistently well done and acted, I believe season 4 is my favorite, from start to finish.  It started with a raging fire and the creepy character played so eeirily by Jason O'Mara and it ended with a wedding.  In between it dove into a multitude of interesting and heartbreaking cases that left a squad member's sibling dead and a squad member severely wounded.  It brought a couple of funny episodes and it brought a couple of episodes that had tears running down my face.  Every episode in season 4 is a gem for their own differing reasons.  It is the season that I find myself watching over and over, more than any of the other seasons and that is saying a lot since I tend to watch the other seasons quite a bit also.  If you like this genre, smart multi-faceted women and a group of men that make you smile, tug at your heart, cheer on to get the bad guy...you'll love this season.",1365465600,,908,4.34319526627219
3494662,5,B001BMGXTI,"This show, is so well put together.  It is often humorous, but still has a good story line about the latest, problem put before the detective team.
The cast works so well together, and off each other, it's always a pleasure to watch.  It's one of our favorite detective shows, and Brenda is our favorite detective.  It's a great show, and I wish they made more like it.

This is a good show for anyone who likes detective shows, with a great cast.  We especially like Brenda's parents, and the long suffering Fitz.

3494682,4,B001BMGXTI,"It took a while for the series to get going but it is hitting on all cylinders by season 4. Very smart writing, just the right combination of humor and drama. Excellent cast is fully in the grove by this point.  There are a few clunker episodes here, when the series decides to get too ""serious"" and start preaching about certain topics. Those episodes really stand out as completely out of character with the rest of the series (smart writing flies out the window, characters doing things they would normally NEVER do and plots full of huge holes) so one assumes the star, who is a flaming liberal (big surprise), or director or producer probably pushed for those topics. Also be prepared for some odd scenes in which the star inexplicably sheds her clothes. This ran  during a period when ""the Closer"" was competing with another TNT series with another past-middle age female star (Holly Hunter) who shed her clothes regularly so one assumes Kyra felt the need to compete. It's not offensive but jarring and in most cases, seems out of place.",1364515200,,1044,4.699453551912568
3494683,5,B001BMGXTI,"This series is still one of our favorite police procedural shows.  Brenda and the team still amuse as they teach us how police work operates.  Provenza and Flynn still provide excellent comic relief, and the tension between Pope and Brenda still moves along.  One thing we can do without, Brenda's Mom and Dad story line.  We don't feel it adds much to the story.",1364515200,,363,4.625

3494700,5,B001BMGXTI,Love the cast.  Kyra Sedgwick is a great actress. I especially like the fact that her character displays a strong and an assertive leadership style all the while she clearly presents herself very feminine.

Then, TNT changed its policy, and I was required to have a cable account, to be able to watch this show online (which made no sense to me). I gave up the cable acct., and my TV, some time ago, so I was not able to continue watching ""The Closer"" online.

I was surprised, and pleased, to discover my new Prime membership not only included many merchandise-related benefits, but also an extensive video library/catalog, among them, the complete series of ""The Closer."" Kyra Sedgwick, J.K. Simmons, and the rest of the cast make for a great ensemble crew. I'm working my way through the series, episode by episode, and none have disappointed yet.

Gil Garcetti is the technical adviser on this show. As I recall, he was the police chief for the city of Los Angeles during the time I lived there. I believe his contribution has given authenticity to the details that make this show the quality program it is.

3494775,5,B001BMGXTI,"The closer is famous for its plot twists but this episode takes the cake.  Special guest star Billy Burke (Twilight, Revolution) gives a stunning performance.  This is my all time favorite episode and very important to the final season and the finale itself.  Best $1.99 I've ever spent to own it.",1351468800,,297,4.784313725490196

Buzz is recording the entire event in a van with Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson in a restaurant parking lot. Provenza and Flynn buy Angie a nice breakfast before transporting her and all the evidence (camera with tape and $20,000) back to the station. Provenza has even put a theft prevention tool on his steering wheel while they eat. Unfortunately, the tool is broken, his car is stolen and the whole case goes joyriding down the highway. Angie is released and finds her husband has been murdered by someone else. To make matters worse, Polk tells Chief Johnson that Provenza will be out of a job if the case is not resolved in 48 hours. Racing against the clock, the team finds a way to get everything back on track and solve the murder. When all is said and done, Provenza and Polk have a hilarious meeting of the minds.

3494782,5,B001BMGXTI,"Please ignore the other reviewer who is taking their frustration with amazon instant video out on this episode. It makes no sense to leave a negative review for the episode, just because you have a problem with amazon video player. The episode was well done. Even with all the action and intensity, the acting was solid and memorable! To address the previous review: they were trying to kill someone wearing a bullet proof body suit and he had an automatic weapon and pipe bombs! That is the reason they were shooting from a distance, and at that distance it was hard to shoot him in the head. That was the reason they couldn't kill him, not because they are stupid, and not because this episode is stupid. I enjoyed this episode, I was riveted!

I come away from this, the third episode of season four, stunned by the edgy, enthralling performances of Kyra Sedgwick, Robert Gossett (Commander Taylor), and guest star Daniel Baldwin (an old favorite from ""Homicide: Life on The Street""). Kudos for the flawless direction of Rick Wallace. A truly powerful episode, a highwater mark for this consistently excellent series.",1319587200,,429,5.323529411764706

3494821,5,B001BMGXTI,"Finished #4 last night and agree with other reviewers they have really stepped up the writing.
The Gabriel and Daniels problems showcased why it is not good to have romance in the workplace. And of course Brenda already knows this from experience!!!
But it is very well written, Kyra at times seems to try Fritz's patience a little too much, but then we all have at times done this to our mates, this gives it that real human feeling on this show.
You feel like you are sitting in the squad room observing!
Can't wait to get started on #5!!! Come back fro the review and go on buy them, it is worth it or borrow your friend's you'll love it!!!",1294272000,3,643,4.322314049586777

If you enjoyed crime dramas, particulary ones that make you think and draw you in this is one to get. If you're a fan of the previous seasons of the Closer, then this season is not one to miss. The show only gets better as the years go by for The Closer. Not all televison shows can claim that.",1285718400,2,549,4.288461538461538

3494840,5,B001BMGXTI,Love this series. No Paid for TV up here in our rural wooods. So love to pick up TV Series by DVD. And this is by far one of our all time favorites. Is it the kits or is it the actors or story or the good writers....and she's married to Kevin Bacon too? Good acting and fun fun fun most of the time. I hate it when they do a too serious one...worse two in a row. Overall this series ranks a 10.....for total packaged deal. More kitty please.,1276300800,,441,3.911111111111111

It is great however to watch uninterrupted episodes of one of the best drama, mystery series on cable tv.",1265760000,,276,4.75
3494858,5,B001BMGXTI,"I am an avid fan of The Closer and Kyra Sedgwick was born to play the role of Brenda Leigh. The writing continues to be top notch and the directing flawless.  The supporting cast is phenomenal. One of my favorite episodes was when she and her staff donned a police uniform to attend a funeral of a fallen comrade. Her walk in slow motion and her posture spoke volumes. I know Ms. Sedgwick has won a golden globe for her role, but not an emmy.  Don't quite understand why not...",1265155200,,477,4.288888888888889

The 4th is certainly no letdown after the others...just more great performances from Kyra Sedgewick and cast! I really like this show and hope it has a very long run. Highly recommended!",1262822400,,328,4.672413793103448
3494862,5,B001BMGXTI,"This series seems to get better and better..It has the right amount of pathos thrown in with the blackest of comedies.

Brenda and her team face a tough season, as they are asked to allow a reporter to tag along, who along the way manages to throw a spanner in the works of the Proirity Homicide unit. Not only this, but a memeber of the team also has to deal with a personal loss, and with all that going on Brenda and Fitz are about to tie the knot.

The dvd extra's are a bit dissapointing, as there aren't any interviews with the cast and only a few behind the scenes and a funny gag reel..but having said this it's worth buying..trust me you won't be dissapointed.. and in the word of Brenda Lee Johnson 'thank you..thank you very much'!",1259539200,,742,4.292857142857143
3494863,5,B001BMGXTI,"The Closer has become one of the best and most watched programs on television. I was hooked on the first season.  Each season has been exciting and well-produced.
In the end of this season, Brenda and Fritz finally get married and like all of this series, things are complicated.  But, all's well that ends well and I am looking forward to the new season with them together as man and wife.  I saw a preview in TV Guide showing Brenda holding a baby kitten.  This, I am sure, is a replacement for ""Kitty"" in the scene where Brenda had to say a final goodby to the cat she had grown to love.  It was a very touching scene.  I say, Hurry with the new season.",1258934400,,656,4.208

3494865,5,B001BMGXTI,"For a non-TV watcher I find myself watching a surprising lot of TV shows, on DVD, lately. First 'Damages', great stuff, and now this cop series. I am hesitant to give it 5 stars, there are plenty of cliches, and not all the jokes work, and some of the cases are lame, and not all members of the team are real people... But overall, it is good fun.
What carries the mixture of suspense and comedy is the central character, Kyra Sedgwick's drawling Georgian homicide investigator in LA, Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson. She is marvellous in her combination of chaos, sentimentality, dishonesty, and ruthless bossiness. I can see how one might also decide to find her unnerving, but I have not reached that stage, I am still enchanted. I don't mind that the whole thing doesn't really seem believable.
Most recommendable for rainy November evenings. Unless you are in Australia, then better watch it in April or May.",1258502400,,915,4.761006289308176

There were also some changes in personal lives for some of the characters, so the story lines moved along.  It seemed almost too short for a whole season as I was finished in a week.  I'll have to see when season 5 is available!",1246924800,,405,4.153846153846154

My only complaint is that TNT broadcasts the show with black bars rather than full screen.  We hate that.

This series shows a head-strong determined WOMAN at work and let's other women know it is okay to let go and have a melt down if need be but probably not a work.

3494908,5,B001BMGXTI,"As most TV shows, one have to be attracted to the major theme. I wasn't at first, but my better half introduced me to ""The Closer"" season 1 and I couldn't stop raving about it. Nowadays, we find ourselves quoting and using some of ""Brenda""'s saying. For people like my partner and I, having the whole season to watch it every time we want is great... I do wish it was cheaper, but when I count how many times I play it.

Season 4 doesn't dissapoint and the clips are great and the features are good too.",1245283200,,503,4.185567010309279
3494909,5,B001BMGXTI,"If you are a fan of the show, you will love Season Four of the Closer.  Even if you are just getting into the show, not only are the show's plots interesting with twists and turns, the characters' plots add to the drama of the show.",1245110400,,232,4.043478260869565
3494910,5,B001BMGXTI,This is without a doubt one of the best series I have seen.  Kyra Sedgwick and the rest of the cast are always outstanding.,1244592000,,123,4.125
3494911,5,B001BMGXTI,"As usual,Kyra Sedgewick brings drama, comedy, & a little love to her show! I have watched this since its begining. I have ALL seasons, like many others who have written reviews. I love the way that 1 season leaves a cliff hangar to the next. At the end of Season 3, after a mall shootout with a teen gang, Julio is shot. The season ends with Kyra flying off in a helicopter to a trauma center. I won't be a season spoiler & tell you how the begining of season 4 deals with that, but its GREAT!! I guess I love Kyra Sedgewick the most because she is so realistic in her comraderie with her team. I too am in public service,& it's like your work force is your second family. I am also along the same age with her & can see the discrimination that goes along with working in a ""man's job"". She shows how she balances her relationship with FBI agent, FRITZIE,with her job. Solving crimes while planning a wedding with her parents, Her father getting sick, and dealing with meeting Fritz's ""psychic"" sister is just a walk in the park for her! I just think this series will continue to get better! GOOD JOB by everyone on the show!!!",1244332800,,1127,4.295774647887324
3494912,5,B001BMGXTI,This series is excellent. A very strong cast which can be both funny  and serious. Kyra ( Brenda ) and Jon Tenney ( Fritz ) are GREAT.,1244332800,,134,3.962962962962963
3494913,5,B001BMGXTI,My favorite show. The characters are well written and well acted and you care about them.  The plots keep you guessing and the back stories are at once amusing and compelling. Somehow they have been able to keep this series fresh.,1244332800,,230,4.609756097560975
3494914,4,B001BMGXTI,"Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick)has one of her most challenging cases when Detective Sanchez's (Raymond Cruz)younger brother Oscar is murdered. It's one of the stand out episodes of the fourth season of ""The Closer"" in a season full of stand out episodes. Although ""The Closer"" has always been exceptional the show took a leap to excellent with episodes like ""Sudden Death"" and the clever, amusing ""Dial `M' For Provenza"" where Lt. Provenza (G. W. Bailey)goes undercover posing as a hit man to snare a woman  looking for someone to kill her husband. The pressure is also on as Fritz and Brenda find that her father is pushing them towards the altar just a bit earlier than they had planned. With a cast featuring J.K. Simmons (""Spider-Man), Corey Reynolds, Robert Gossett, Tony Denison, Jon Tenney, Michael Paul Chan, Gina Ravera, Phillip P. Keene and others it's hard to go wrong and with the top notch writing/direction on this show the actors have great material to work with.

As with previous seasons the performances are flawless but more importantly, the writing and direction equal the actors in this terrific 15 episode season.  The nice thing about the show is that the series constantly employs the best character actors working in Hollywood. That's fortunate for viewers of the show but unfortunate for other TV shows. More importantly we get some strong work by some terrific directors from actor Kevin Bacon to Roxann Dawson (""Star Trek: Voyager""). That's not to suggest that the other directors are slouches when it comes to doing their job--all the director's do an outstanding job with the best written episodes.

There were only a couple of weak episodes for the fourth season and they were few and far between. The episodes that didn't stray from the series formula much tended to be the weaker ones of the bunch. Luckily, the writers/directors/producers play with that formula quite a bit.

""The Closer"" looks extremely good with a nice, crisp presentation on DVD that doesn't look over processed. Flesh tones are natural looking. The anamorphic transfers looks better than most TV shows on home video.

Audio isn't unusual or adventurous but the show is primarily a dialog driven show. The few, brief action scenes are nicely placed around the Surround speakers.

No commentary tracks which is a pity I would have loved to hear Kevin Bacon or Roxann Dawson discuss their role as directors on the show particularly with their backgrounds as actors.

We do get deleted scenes for ""Speed Bump"", ""Tijuana Brass"", ""Good Faith"", ""Fate Line"" and ""Double Blind"" the concluding episode of the fourth season.

We get two very good featurettes that show quite a bit of imagination and should be saluted for the exceptional work that went into them. ""To Catch a Lie"" features an FBI interrogator discussing how law enforcement catches folks messing with the truth.

""A Day in the Life of a Homicide Detective"" features series  star Corey Reynolds riding along with a retired LAPD Detective.

Finally we an amusing gag reel as part of the mix.

The fourth season of ""The Closer"" continues to develop the wonderfully realized characters on the show. The writing and direction take a jump up in quality producing the best season yet and some of the most exceptional episodes of the series' run.

With some of the best character actors in Hollywood featured on this show, it leaves other shows wanting. That's too bad for those other shows and great for fans of ""The Closer"".",1243987200,8,3491,4.9452991452991455
3494915,1,B001BMGXTI,"I stopped watching at season 3. Brenda's parents were in every episode and it was all about her and Fritz and their love/hate relationship (based soley on Brenda's constant selfishness). The first two seasons were awesome, but alas this series jumped the shark all too soon and stopped taking itself seriously.

5 24 11: I started watching again and apparently the writers and directors read my reviews coz they whipped it back in shape! Yes thanks to me!",1241049600,7,455,4.833333333333333

Maybe it's my computer, which I find hard to fathom, maybe it's Amazon but whatever it was throughout the entire episode it kept stopping to download.  Extremely annoying!  Re: this episode, not the best.  They're usually really good cops; on this episode they were idiots and extremely horrible shots!  I hope the next episode shows them all at a shooting range!",1235692800,,486,4.647058823529412

From Kyra Sedgewick's quirky Brenda Lee to all of her detectives and thier ""baggage"". Never has their been a detective show that could appeal in quite this way. I never miss a show and I have thoroughly enjoyed my other DVD's from the prior seasons more than any other set of DVD's that I have.",1235260800,6,471,4.0212765957446805

3494921,5,B001BMGXTI,I am a VERY BIG FAN OF THIS SHOW-I have watched every episode of this series from Season 1 to 4 multiple times! Season 4 episodes have ran the gambit from serious to comedic-the plots have been a joy to watch- but I will say the quality has somewhat suffered this past season & I truly hope the next season of episodes will return the show to its past glory. This show in my opinion is ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS EVER TO GRACED TV & KYRA'S PORTRAYAL OF BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON AS ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED/UNFORGETTABLE CHARACTERS IN TV HISTORY!,1234396800,5,542,4.323529411764706
3494922,5,B001BMGXTI,"I have been an avid fan of this television show since the first episode of the first season.  I have purchased all previous seasons.  I noticed that with the beginning of season four an upgrade had been made with regards to the writing, plots, and characterizations of the shows regulars.  (We still don't know Provenza's first name...) The most rewarding thing for me is that everything about the show improved in a very dramatic way.  I love watching all the previous seasons' shows over and over again, but I anticipate that season four will be equally great especially without all the commercials!  Kyra Sedgwick is the tasty bait for this show, but every other actor on the set is a joy to behold.  I applaud the writers and the directors for bringing out everyone's best!!!!",1230249600,39,780,4.7407407407407405
3494923,5,B001BMGXTI,"Kyra Sedqwick is not only interesting, but slightly annoying (in a good way) in her role as Brenda Leigh Johnson. In one scene she can give us a performance full of drama lightened by the quirkiness of her character.

Season 4 of The Closer was excellent. It was full of change and of very good and well written episodes. The team came under fire from the press for what is and what is not called Priority Homicide. This leads to a major restructuring of the squad and a very interesting turn of events thanks to Brenda's quick thinking. The squad had to deal with their own problems: interpersonal relationships (Daniels and Gabriel) and one of them has to deal the loss of a loved one. Brenda's parents came for an episode and put Brenda and Fritz' relationship in the limelight. Just when are they going to get married?!

Brenda and Fritz also had to deal with moving to a new (temporary) place and with their relationship. The episodes of the closer were excellent coming to a rather explosive and great season finale.",1221523200,28,1022,4.6098901098901095

I got hooked on Season One and it gets better from there.....even though I thought Season One was a great intro into the later seasons as far as getting to know ""Brenda"".

The entire cast is great.
