8760554,5,B01FBEKI74,"The plot was easy to follow not predictable in the lease. I love the way it flowed. The quality of the video was clear ant the sound was great. I cast it from my laptop to my 55In LED Smart TV without any lag of speech.. I have been following T Styles for a few years now and she just continues to amaze me. I just watched season 2 episode 1 and it promises to be just as good as season 1. Every episode just gets better and better. T Styles is a hell of a writer and has brought her greatness to the Film ,and the transition from print to film is great.actually i find the film to be more dramatic that the print. It jives very well of what one would imagine the charters to be in print and actually seeing them. Not a lot of authors can do this successfully. This movie had all one would want from a Urban tale. Killing , sex, drugs and fine ass women and sexy men.",1479513600,,867,3.96
8760555,4,B01FBEKI74,"I only rented it for the 1.99 and I think it was worth it. Quality of picture wasn't great on my 60"" LED TV. but wasn't bad neither. plot was nice enjoyed it a picture and the scenes flowed like if I was reading the book. I have watched it twice and wil watch 1 more time before my 7 days are up. I would recommend renting it . Great price and worth the time to watch. I did love seeing the charters , not like i would imagine them much nicer. for the men 1 of the Girls are fine as Frog Hair",1466899200,,492,3.7403846153846154

8760558,4,B01FBEKI74,So the 8 minute youtube segments were killing me so I finally watched the whole thing on Amazon. At first I wasn't to sure about this one even though I am a huge T. Styles fan.  But once again T. Styles sucked me in and I enjoyed season one. All of the actors were great and Roz kind of reminds me of T. Styles in a way. Looking forward to Season 2 and I really want to see how the baby sister will react now that things have changed forever in the HOOD household.,1465171200,2,464,3.9361702127659575

8760561,5,B01FBEKI74,"Great series....
I loved this show  from the very beginning.  I am a huge T Styles fan and she did not disappoint.  The characters were interesting and pulled me in from the beginning.  The Hood family is definitely not a family you want on your bad side.  They are crazy but they understand the value of family.  T Styles keep up the good work and hurry up with season 2...lol",1464134400,,377,4.314285714285714
