2398970,5,B000B19EBE,Excellent music and video with many active kids holds our kids' attention well. While under 2 they are beginning to sing the last words of many of the worship songs.,1174867200,,165,4.533333333333333
2398971,5,B000B19EBE,My 9 month old son is not interested in the Baby Einstein movies at all...so I was a little skeptical about these.  I bought the CD for the car (God of Wonders) and he loved it so much I thought...why not buy the DVDs.  He really likes seeing the other babies on the screen...he even waved at one last night!  So cute!  This is a great alternative to Baby Einstein...and it has wonderful Christian songs!!  I cannot wait for them to come out with more!,1173312000,,452,4.270588235294118
2398972,5,B000B19EBE,"My baby doesn't watch any other videos, not interested.  But she loves these videos and so do I.  I never tire of the praise and worship music played.",1170892800,,150,4.321428571428571
2398973,5,B000B19EBE,"This collection was the best purchase I ever made. My son from the time he turned 5 months old was like the Energizer Bunny gone haywire. He wanted to crawl wherever he wanted and if he didn't get his way, would scream and wail like a banshee. However, once I popped in this move, he was so in tune with the music, esp. the childrens voices and the bright, bold colors, it was the only way I could actually be with my son and spend 'quiet time' with him in my arms... He's 21 months old now and still LOVES this video! Even when my own mother came in town to visit, she was in awe by his reaction to this video. It completely calmed him. I would recommend this video to ANY Mom out there for their babies or toddlers or even for yourself; the music is great, it just makes you feel good! Now anytime a friend or family member have a babyshower, this is always one of my picks!",1158883200,2,876,4.098837209302325
2398974,5,B000B19EBE,"I am very happy with the Praise Baby Collection Gift Set.  My 10 month old is totally mesmorized with the images and loves moving to the worship music. Although not totally ""my"" style of worship music, the words are wonderful and the music is pleasant to listen to so I don't get irritated by it.  Cheaper to buy the set than separately.",1156377600,,337,4.419354838709677
2398975,5,B000B19EBE,"These videos run circles around other baby DVD sets.  My daughter (who is a year now), has watched them since birth and still is just as entertained by them.  Trust me...I have done other baby sets(Baby Einstein, Fisher Price baby, etc.) and none of them hold her attention like this one. I love it becuase it is very stimulating video set to all contemporary worship songs and hymns.  I like the fact that she can be watching it and I can be listening and enjoying it in another room. This has now become my standard baby shower gift!",1156118400,,535,4.438775510204081
2398976,5,B000B19EBE,"My children adore these videos. The music sends them the most important message in

life! I love listening to it in the background even when I can't see the TV screen... These

songs/videos are among few today that have a healthy message.",1152921600,4,238,4.642857142857143
2398977,5,B000B19EBE,I am a mother of a 10 month old daughter and greatly appreciate theses DVD's.  The worship music is awesome and the video keeps my youngster entertained.  Whenever she gets a little fussy we put her down to watch these videos and instantly she starts smiling and dancing and it puts Mommy and Daddy in a better mood too!!!  What a great way to introduce them to worshipping our Awesome God!!,1150848000,7,391,4.47887323943662
2398978,5,B000B19EBE,"I am a blessed Mommy of twin daughters and a four year old! We all greatly love these awesome praise videos. It is so wonderful to see the smiles on my little ones faces as we dance and I sing along to my favorite worship songs. It's a very nice change from the oh so common classical ballards and nursery music we are all so used to. I think it is a great way to get little ones of all ages excited about worshiping our God and Savior! The pictures are also very enjoyable and entertaining to my girls and myself. I greatly disagree with other reviewers who rave about Baby Einstein and Baby Faith and are unhappy with Baby Praises content. I was happy to finally find a dvd that I can sit down and enjoy with my children instead of wanting a video to just keep them busy. I have enough of those! These are definetly ones we can enjoy together, it's our special time and I pray worship will continue to be our special time as they grow older. I think this is a great way to incorporate it at such a young and influential age. I actually played these dvd's while my little ones were napping. It was very inspiring to sing along while cleaning up and doing daily chores. I was as excited as them to start the rest of our day together. Wish I had known about this gift set before purchasing all of the dvd's seperatly. Highly reccomend this video for anyone who wants to help their children and themselves stay focused on worshiping God and Jesus in their everyday lives. I don't think it's ever to early to start that!!!",1138665600,21,1519,4.277777777777778

2398980,5,B000B19EBE,"I purchased these for my granddaughters son after she was born and even in the very first months she was absolutely in love with them.  There were many times a day she would get fussy due to some digestion issues,  but we would put these on and she was memorized by them.  The songs, pictures, and videos are amazing and captivates her attention still at 2 1/2 years old. ..now my newest granddaughter is also enjoying these videos. I LOVE that my girls are learning wonderful meaningful songs of the Lord and don't worry about the videos that they are seeing on these ;-) They are great in the car when traveling. ...a true ""lifesaver"" to those who travel much distances with small children....I was so impressed with these videos that I purchased the Christmas edition for my granddaughters  :-) If you have young children and don't have these-order them! !! You will not be appointed! !! I hope they will make more collections :-)",1454198400,,933,4.636363636363637

The graphics etc are a little dated but the music is great and my son is entertained by them.  He's too young to know its outdated!!

2398992,5,B000B19EBE,Have ordered this three times this year. It was loved by our son who had a daughter who would settle down when he held her and put on the praise music. He swore by it (this granddaughter who loved the music is now 10) so I bought it for our new Great Grandbabies.,1416441600,,263,3.981132075471698
2398993,5,B000B19EBE,"We were given the Praise Baby DVD with the pink fish on it, (God of Wonders I think) as a baby shower gift back in 2006. 2 years later, we had our 2nd child, (both girls). We loved the firs tone so much as well as did pur first born, we played it almost continually. I ordered the other 3. Love all of them. As well as did our girls. Now, both are grown and in school, but We have them on loan to a local Christian Mothers Day Out program. These DVDs make a wonderful gift. And work amazingly when you have a fussy baby. They also put me in a worshipful mood. We will treasure these for years to come.",1414108800,,601,3.9344262295081966

It has age appropriate video (shapes, kids, adults, different colors,etc) that he loves.  He loves the songs.  We had friends over and after watching a few minutes of the video were delighted and bought it for themselves. Great gift, highly recommend if you are looking for a good Christian praise and worship video for your children.",1407283200,,464,4.7625
2398998,5,B000B19EBE,"I read the reviews before purchasing this DVD set and can gladly say I agree with everyone else!! These are awesome!! My 4 month old loves to sit in her swing and watch these for a good 20-30 minutes...which is surprising because she won't stay in her swing that long otherwise. I love that it is praise and worship music that keeps her attention, and not some mindless attention-grabber. My husband and I find ourselves humming and singing the songs to ourselves/daughter even when the DVDs aren't playing. I'm so glad I got these and I'm also really glad I got the set of 4 so we can have some variety while watching them throughout the week. I definitely recommend these and will probably buy them to give as gifts to any of my friends who are becoming new parents.",1407196800,,768,4.492857142857143

2399003,5,B000B19EBE,"We introduced this collection to our son when he was four months old. He really enjoys the stimulation and I think the music creates a peaceful environment! My husband thinks so too when he comes home from work and walks into the house with worship music on. I like that all the DVDs have the option to play female lead vocals, child lead vocals or instrumental. We have the Baby Einstein collection as well, but Praise Baby is lightyears better!",1396051200,,446,4.5875

He loves Elmo but prefers to watch praise baby any day. Esp now that he is expanding his vocab, he is seeing all the DVDs under a new light.  He loves seeing and calling out everything with all the new words he is learning. His lil brother is now enjoying it with him. I recently bought another set so I can gift it to my brother for his first baby.
I recall being watching it with my newborn as a first time mom, and being so incredibly blessed by the beautiful praise music and being in tears as the Spirit moved me. Perfect gift for any new moms!",1356480000,,691,3.832167832167832

2399026,5,B000B19EBE,"A friend recommended these at my baby shower and I bought the set of 4 dvd's when my son was about 4 months old.  He didn't pay much attention to them until he was at least 9 months old, but it's nice to have playing as background music, which is what I often did.  Once he hit one year old he became fascinated with these and would sit still for the entire disc (or if not sitting at least stand and sway to the music).  We began using these prior to bedtime to get him to slow down.  They're great, his absolute favorite parts are when the adults or kids come on the screen, especially if they're looking into the camera - he'll wave at them!  Now at 15 months he's still entertained by these and it's a fool-proof way to get him to calm down or sit quietly if needed.",1305504000,,770,4.072847682119205
2399027,4,B000B19EBE,"My baby loves these videos! Even if he is cranky, as soon as you start the DVD up, he just stares at it, smiles and laughes. He didn't really get interact with them much until about 4 months old, but now he just loves them!
An update for the videos would be the only thing that would make it better (some of the people and colors look like Sesame Street from the early 90s on VHS).",1304294400,,381,4.026315789473684
2399028,4,B000B19EBE,"I bought the Praise Baby DVDs because people said they were just like Baby Einstein. To be fair, they are similar, but NOT the same. They feature worship songs sung by a woman and children, along with video images of children playing and various child's toys. It's very nice, but not Baby Einstein (if you're a Baby Einstein fan). They are wonderful videos for your child, and really great for background music/images. However, if you are looking for the quality of a Baby Einstein video, with a Christian message, Baby Faith videos are outstanding. They are IDENTICAL to baby Einstein videos. Even the woman's voice seems the same! Calming, soft, and reassuring. They are very high quality, and along the same lines, except the messages are bible stories. God Made Me: ""On the first day, God said, 'Let there be light.""  (pause) ""LIGHT..."" proceeded by visually stimulating sights of light and color, accompanied by classical music. This continues through the story of creation. The dialog is minimal, but there. Every so often a baby's face will appear and the beautiful voice of the woman says, ""God LOVES you."" Baby Faith videos appear to be made by the same director, choreographer, producer as Baby Einstein--although they are not.",1299715200,7,1237,4.975845410628019
2399029,5,B000B19EBE,"Some friends of ours gave this to us just about 5 days ago. Magnificent!!!!!!
We play it to help our 13month old cool down after bath time just before we put him down for the night. He watches the images and says ""bah-be"" everytime a baby shows up or ""whoof"" when he recognizes a doggie. Very educational with out being stiff and boring. It's casual learning.

We watch it with him so it's not a passive experience and we point out a few things here and there but we mostly just let him watch or dance around,clap or even just walk around in the area where our living room is. This series is so calming, and healing too. The worshipful atmosphere just kills any bad energy in the room. It's been a useful tool in our child's bed time routine. He gets no TV at all  except 10- 30mins based on how tired he is by the time we get to the calm down video session.
I would recommend it to everyone, christians and non-christians. We're buying a bunch for all our friends with new babies. Oh, yeah, we switchout the DVD to another one every two days so it doesn't get monotonous.",1294444800,,1072,4.275862068965517

2399033,5,B000B19EBE,"These videos are one of the only things our little guy likes to watch while he's going to sleep.  And they do the trick every time.  Even when his two older cousins are around, we pop one of these into the DVD player and it's like there's a switch in their heads.  They stop whatever they're doing and are just mesmerized by the pictures.  The music is tasteful and appropriate and I find myself humming a few of the tunes even while I'm at work.",1284422400,,446,4.211764705882353
2399034,5,B000B19EBE,"My daughter just turned one and is VERY active. She doesn't like TV and doesn't sit still for anything except eating (sometimes), but the second these videos start she watches them without moving (except to dance!). She LOVES these videos! And what a sanity saver they have been for traveling because she will happily watch them over and over again without being upset that she is in the car for a long time. I like that the images moves very slowly so it's not over stimulating and she loves seeing all the kids and animals in the videos. Plus since the music is something that I like it's a win for all.",1283472000,,605,4.410714285714286
2399035,5,B000B19EBE,"I put these DVDs in to play for my son, who is now four years old, when he was a newborn.  Then, the music and singing was very soothing, plus I could sing along to them.  As he grew, he was very captivated with the DVDs, music and images.  I have been playing them more again, since I have another baby (a girl this time).  She is just as captivated with them as my son was.  Even playing them now, my four year old watches them all the way through.  I whole heartedly recommend them!",1276992000,5,485,4.052631578947368
2399036,5,B000B19EBE,"Exactly what I wanted.  The music is so soothing.  Our baby isn't due for another 2 weeks but I really enjoy listening to them as I do my housework and make dinner.  My sister had one of the DVD's for her daughter and I always thought that the dinner prep time at her house was so peaceful despite her 3 kids and my two.  When I found out I was pregnant with my #3, it was just the excuse I was looking for to order these.  I honestly wish I hadn't waited.  The pictures are fine and I'm sure the baby will love them.  My 8 and 10 yr old boys do balk a bit at the images but they acknowledge that the music is nice and don't complain when I pop a DVD in.  Having something for the baby to watch as she grows that calms me rather than gets more annoying the more you listen to it is priceless!",1255824000,,792,3.875776397515528
2399037,5,B000B19EBE,"My son just turned a year old and we ordered these DVDs for him for his birthday. He loves them!! Very soothing and peaceful, not annoying like some children's DVDs. We LOVE the fact that these DVDs promote Christian living- even for little ones! We highly recommend these. =)",1242000000,3,276,4.653061224489796
2399038,5,B000B19EBE,Love all the Praise Baby DVD's.  Can't start them early enough on this - good for all ages!  Like the adult or children choice of vocals on each DVD.  Beautiful photography and visuals.  Bear cub and Grandma Bear like these!,1241395200,4,224,4.525
2399039,5,B000B19EBE,"I love and would recommend these DVD's to anyone who has a baby, and I buy the gift set as a baby shower gift.  I have two girls, 13 mos. apart.  Many times this was the ""cure all"" when I couldn't get a fussy baby to calm down.  The songs became familiar to them and as they grew older (now 2 and 3 years old) the DVD's became a part of our bedtime routine, playing them while we get ready for bed to help settle them down.  I have watched these DVD's hundreds of times and the voices singing the songs are not annoying in the least.  The video is bright and as they get older it is even educational with some counting and ABC's.  I recently gave the set to my sister in law, her son is now 6 months old.  She told me it was the best shower gift she received.  I love them, now expecting my 3rd...  I know I will be hearing these even more.  Can't say enough about the Praise Baby collection.  I got my first DVD for 5$ at a Family Christian Bookstore, it was on special.  Now I usually order the gift sets through MusiChristian.com.",1207526400,4,1033,4.0594059405940595
2399040,5,B000B19EBE,"These DVDs are wonderful entertainment for our baby.  I got them when he was just six weeks old and he's loved them since.  The songs are beautiful and uplifting (even for parents - no annoying kids' songs stuck in your head all day), and our son loves to watch the images.  He smiles and coos at the other babies, the animals, the people.  I like also that there are letters, numbers, and shapes involved.  Sometimes I sit with him and tell him what he is seeing (red ball, baby, dog, etc).  When he is really fussy, these videos calm him right down when nothing else will.  They also sometimes provide a much-needed break for me during the day - I can get things done around the house while he is happily engaged.",1206489600,2,715,4.371212121212121
2399041,5,B000B19EBE,"My 10 month old has been watching these videos since she was only 3 months old and absolutely loves them.  As soon as she starts hearing the worship music, she gets this big grin on her face.  I love them too as Praise Music flows through our home and fills our hearts with such joy.",1200873600,,283,4.127272727272727
2399042,3,B000B19EBE,"Film/graphics is of poor quality.  The videos are too short only 30 minutes or so for each DVD (I expected at least 40 to 45 minutes). Songs are OK, but  everything seems altogether slow and not very upbeat.",1200700800,,207,4.421052631578948

She has been watching these since about 4 months old and now she ""dances"" to the music now and has even tried to sing!  Not only does it give us a little ""break"" (which I do not intend on using the TV for a baby sitter mind you)....but it's early teachings about our Lord and Savior.  These DVD's are worth as much as our house cost in my mind!",1188950400,,504,4.154639175257732

2399047,5,B000B19EBE,"I can not say enough good things about this DVD collection.  We purchased it when our son was a newborn.  We had it playing a lot during those first few months.  The music is so uplifting and encouraging.  When the time came that he was interested in TV, NOTHING captivated his attention like these DVD's.  He is 10 months old now and when he hears the first note of music, he stops what he is doing and crawls within sight of the TV.  He LOVES these.  I recommend them to every expectant mother and those with small children.  I would say this is one of my top 3 things I would not want to be without when baby #2 comes along.",1180569600,2,627,4.12396694214876
