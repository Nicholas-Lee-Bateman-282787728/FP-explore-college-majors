4097282,5,B0039S37F0,"If you hate bad flicks this disc may not be your thing but if you do like ""so bad its good"" movies than turn your brain off you'll love what you have on this disc . Superargo is the real gem. While not a beautiful presentation it looks like something you'd watch at a grindhouse.

Wacky Taxi on the other had has some laughs and the John Aston factor to go for it. The only question I have is why double this one with Superargo. Even with that ,it works!

Finally for extras you get a trailer and a commentary with Cinema Head Cheese. Prettyy funny stuff but really dirty.

buy it",1278633600,,580,4.160714285714286
4097283,2,B0039S37F0,"I have to fundamentally agree with the other review - the absolute bare-bones quality of this disc is a huge disappointment, and anyone placing this against any of the earlier entries in either the original ""Welcome to the Grindhouse"" double features or the newer ""Exploitation Cinema"" releases is in for a big disappointment.

In addition to a lack of trailers or option to play the films back to back, there is virtually no restoration at all on these prints, so you get films (especially Superargo) with severe vinegar effects (washing out of color and reddening of blacks) making the print quality about on par with a dollar store title, or something from videoasia.  That makes a sad contrast to the great restoration done (primarily to the Crown Films library) when the series was young, and just seems like a ""we-don't-care"" attitude on the part of Code Red.  Even the menu system is different, and believe me when I say it resembles dollar store junk as much as the print quality and lack of restoration of these films.

I own every other disc in this series, as well as the aforementioned Grindhouse series, so I have a measure to go by.  I will not be buying these new in the future based on the shoddy quality of this one, maybe used copies, but not new ones, as they are no longer worth the modest price if they are virtually slapped together with no effort to present them well or restore the source prints.

Lastly, the 'comedy commentary"" by Cinema Head Cheese is a complete waste of an audio track.  Compare that to Bobby Bresee doing commentary for Mausoleum earlier in the series - here we get just some ordinary guys with absolutely no connection to the picture trying to crack lame jokes without giving any insight into the movie at all.  Utterly stupid, and another reason to pass on this one.  It's too bad, as I loved this series, but it really has hit the skids.  We know these were marginal pictures to begin with - we don't need smarmy comments and lack of print restoration to remind us.",1277856000,5,2014,4.600558659217877
4097284,1,B0039S37F0,"I'm a fan of these series of films.  This review is not about the films.

The DVD is a disappointment because they have done away with the Grindhouse Double feature format, perhaps the main reason I've been buying these DVDs.  It's great to play a double feature with commercials in front and in the middle of the movies.

Unfortunately, this DVD only allows you to play each movie separate and has a trailer for Wacky Taxi as a separate feature.  Considering this is probably the last in this series the company will release(along with Lonely Wives/Sorry Wrong Bedroom Double feature which I haven't watched yet, but I assume its got the same issue) its a huge disappointment.

This series isn't a huge seller and they probably won't continue selling them.  But doing away with the play all double feature aspect is probably the death knell for the series.  You could just buy these movies separate for a lot cheaper and not be losing anything.

Poor DVD production.  This is clearly the Death of this series.  I regret buying this despite the obscure movies i got.",1274745600,8,1066,4.708108108108108
4097285,4,B0039S37F0,"This was the second of two Superargo movies from Italy produced in the 1960s. The first,Superargo vs. Diabolicus gave us more or less the hero's origin as he goes from masked wrestling champion to masked secret agent to foil a mad man bent on world conquest. This is the follow-up. Someone is kidnapping champion athletes and turning them into mindless robots. Much like Neil Hamilton and Stafford Repp the police and secret service here have no clue,so they call in Superargo to save the day. The former wrestling champion has taken up with an Indian yogi who has taught him to unleash the power of his mind. So not only is the masked man a physical phenomenon,but he now posseses telekinetic powers. The production vaues in this film are a little higher than you would find in your typical mexiluchahero movie,but you still get a story that Jim Kelly would say ""comes straight out of a comic book"".Superargo is portrayed by Ken Wood(real name Giovanni Cianfriglia)who was probally better known as Steve Reeves' stunt double and who played the villian in the Reg Park film Hercules,the Avenger. The villian here is played by former American western star Guy Madison. The film is dubbed into English and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of el Santo films and the mexiluchahero genre. There should have been a third movie to make a Superargo trilogy.",1265760000,11,1354,4.76595744680851

8392258,4,B0039S37F0,"This review is only for Superargo.  Not bad mid-60's Euro-made, English-dubbed superhero adventure film.  The hero, named Superargo, has a swami minion who aids him and teaches him to levitate.  Together they battle a scientist criminal who has created an army of robotic, zombiefied musclemen to use as muscle.  What the scientist is after I'm not quite sure but it doesn't matter much.  The quality of the DVD is not terrible but it needs re-mastering.  The color and picture is not bad but it has a pinkish tinge.  It also does not have the trailer.  Recommended for fans of this genre.
PS: When is Superargo vs. Diabolicus going to be released to US DVD.",1458345600,,658,4.7105263157894735

8392264,2,B0039S37F0,The movie ia as silly and fun as it gets but the print used for this dvd was so panned and scanned that there was literally scenes where you know people are there talking but all you see is back ground. It takes some getting used to. The movie was what one should expect of a sixties early seventies euro film. The plot is silly and the actors are over the top. The quality of the transfer is a real bummer!,1322611200,4,407,4.037037037037037
8392265,1,B0039S37F0,"The first movie Wacky Taxi is okay and if you are buying this DVD for this movie you won't be disappointed. However, I purchased this for the Superargo film. All I have to say is - ""Is quality this bad even allowed?""

The Superargo film also called ""L'invincibile Superman"" and ""Superargo vs. The Faceless Giants"" is an sequel to ""Superargo Vs. Diabolikus"" and both are Italian made and both were originally shot in Cinemascope or 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Unfortunately I have never seen a home version of this film in it's original aspect ratio and that is too bad because the 1.85:1 crop leaves a lot of scenes where you have to guess what is going on. Moreover, what really leaves you wondering what is happening on the screen is the truly horrible condition that the print is in. I'm not talking just pops scratches and splices. I'm talking almost the entire film being ""pink"" due to vinegar burn. I'm not kidding the movie is really that unwatchable.

I'm not a big fan of Sinister Cinema but they do have a better print of this film and I advise you to get that version. It's still cropped at 1.85:1 but it is a night and day difference compared to this crappy print.

One day maybe Superargo fans will get both films in their original scope and from the original negatives. Until then if you want to see this movie get the Sinister Cinema version please!",1306195200,4,1357,4.530612244897959
8392266,4,B0039S37F0,"I'm grateful Sinister Cinema is creating affordable and decent DVD's of some of these obscure films.  It would be nice to one day get it in wdescreen, but this will do for now.  The grainy full frame does recreate that feeling of catching a strange film on TV late at night - I remember when that was the only way I could hope to see these kinds of films.

This is a great camp superhero movie, with all the fun you might hope for from a sixties European action film.  A mad scientist, groovy girls, and sped-up action.  The hero, whom we never see unmasked, also has a spiritual/guru sidekick who sort of manages to be Yoda and Robin in one.  One of those surreal kinds of films that make it feel like 3 AM no matter what time of the day you watch it.",1295740800,7,752,4.151724137931034
