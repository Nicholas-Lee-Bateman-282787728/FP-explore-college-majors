8394851,5,B003DN9Y08,"I watched this DVD with a notepad and pen in hand and got the information that seemed relevant to my situation.  For me, this is much more time- efficient than reading a book.  The information was clearly presented and easy to follow - but a bit rapid at times - so was easy to pause and catch up.  Great DVD - very informative and helpful.",1400112000,3,340,4.2
8394852,5,B003DN9Y08,"this was a helpful dvd, I learned a lot from it. I am glad that I purchased it, I was having some problems & don't really have good medical insurance so I must admit that  this helped me learn about thyroid disorders & what I needed to do to help myself..

I would recommend this to anyone with thyroid issues.",1378425600,5,310,4.15
8394853,4,B003DN9Y08,"I learned a lot but was surprised it didn't deal more with what I was interested in, which was the way the body uses cytomel or C3.  I had my thyroid removed years ago because the doctor suspected thyroid cancer.  It was only thyroiditis, which is sad, because removal was not necessary, and levothyroxine alone doesn't keep me from being incredibly sleep every afternoon.  I traveled to San Francisco to find an endocrinologist who would prescribe cytomel (T3), but they only let me have .05 mcg. and I still fight sleep every day.  Also, Dr. Bhattacharia, here in Santa Cruz, paralyzed my left vocal cord when he removed the thyroid.  I was a voice major in college.

I was hoping to find more information on how thyroid supplements T4 and T3 help people like me and also those with bipolar or depression.  I do know it is given, in small dosages, to bipolar patients, but I don't know why.",1373155200,8,892,4.572327044025157
8394854,4,B003DN9Y08,"This is a computation and overview of information and serves as a great starting point for
a study of a thyroid problem. He is probably the best informed if you want to stay in the
'natural' way of taking care of health problems. I have never met anyone who had a thyroid
removed that fared well and most struggled everyday with trying to get well generally.
I believe in the future that removing a persons Thyroid will be viewed as a barbaric
unnecessary procedure.  Study and learn.",1372723200,7,484,4.563218390804598
8394855,1,B003DN9Y08,This DVD runs 50 minutes not 1 1/2 hours.  There is no information on it that is on many places on the web. Nothing new.  He is trying to sell his books so you can find out more.,1353801600,7,178,3.6578947368421053
