8021930,5,B000244F1Y,"Another installment in what I consider the BEST ANIME EVER PRODUCED!
Visually stunning with an incredibly rich and complex yet engaging storyline.
The music is also bar-none in comparison with todays broadcast norm.
I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed in this series.
HOWEVER, I recommend you watch the volumes in order to understand the complex storyline.
ENJOY!",1297209600,,368,5.362068965517241
8021931,5,B000244F1Y,"Last Exile is one of my favorite animes. I love the story and the characters, especially those of the Guild who are held ""prisoners"" aboard the Silvana.

Though it may not touch the hearts of all, for those it does touch, it is an unforgettable story about the dream of Claus and Lavie to fly in the Grand Stream, the harsh air currents that stole their fathers, and finding the mysterious legendary vessel known as Exile. With their responsibilities now heading beyond the call of duty, tragic events will begin to unfold.

All hands, prepare to brace for impact as they enter the Grand Stream in a battle to gain Exile.",1292716800,,621,4.585585585585585
8021932,4,B000244F1Y,"Last Exile starts to pick up as the series begins to form a clearer direction as it passes it's halfway point and the characters each prepare in their own way to face Queen Delphine and her forces.

Sophia's secret identity, revealed in the last volume, becomes useful on both political and personal scales as she takes her place as a powerful diplomatic figure - finally discovering the Guild's true intentions - and is able to pass on to Claus and Lavie information about the reason their fathers died.

The character who really shines in this volume, however, is Lord Dio Eraclea.  Although we have had our suspicions, it is now that we finally get a fairly clear picture of his true nature and it is finally established whether he is a spy or a good-intentioned deserter as we see a different, very human side of him behind the bravado that he had not previously shown anyone.  We get a further idea of what the Silvana is going to be dealing with in his sister Delphine through his point of view, building up tension for when the Silvana will finally confront her.

All in all, an excellent lead-in to the tense volume that follows.",1104105600,,1137,4.58128078817734
8021933,5,B000244F1Y,"""Grand Stream,"" Volume 5 (of 6) contains some of the most exciting episodes of the series. All the plots are finally coming together: old characters reappear, former enemies set aside their differences, and all to work to defeat the ""malicious queen"" Delphine and capture Exile.
Fans of Dio and Sophia will be particularly pleased by Volume 5, as they are given center stage. In fact, Ep. 18 is called ""Promotion Sophia."" As you know, when a pawn reaches the end of the board, it is ""promoted"" to Queen--in Sophia's case, Empress. The whole coronation sequence is simply GORGEOUS.
Unfortunately, there isn't much in terms of the DVD's ""extra"" material. There's a textless opening, a character gallery, and the obligatory Geneon previews. C'est tout. Oh well, I'm still glad I bought the DVD, and I can't wait for the next installment (""Queen Delphine"").",1093910400,,853,5.014084507042254
8021934,5,B000244F1Y,"This has got to be the best anime series ever!!! The characters all have incredible depth and have their own personalities. After watching the last dvd 'breakthrough' I am still waiting for this one to come out. I know you get this all the time but this is true,Believe me you have got to get this show, it is the best!!! If you wanna talk about it or anything else my screen name is ashi randi 34.",1089072000,2,398,4.181818181818182
