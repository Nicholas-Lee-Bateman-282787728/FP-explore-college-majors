4020979,5,B002ZG97M4,"I loved the remake of Footloose. I was a fan of the original, and think this movie stayed true to the first, and added so much to it.

Kenny Wormald does a fantastic job as Ren- boy can act, move, is hot,and has chemistry with the whole cast. Julianne Hough does a great job as Ariel.
She has really impressed me with her acting, and can dance so well. Miles Teller as Willard.. WOW. I'd never seen him in anything before, but
he's so funny. As good as Kenny, and Julianne are in this (and they are good), Miles has some great scene stealing moments. His girlfriend, Rusty, is
also fantastic. I'm not sure of the actress, but she's beautiful, and can dance. Andie McDowell is fantastic as Ariel's mom, Vi. She has a understated
strength. Dennis Quaid does a good job as the concerned father of Ariel, and the town reverend. There are several fantastic scenes where Ren and the Reverend
talk- my favorite being towards the end when he asks for permission to take Ariel to the dance. And of course Ren's speech at the town council is excellent.
And watching Willard learn to dance was HILARIOUS. And the little girls (Ren's cousins) are pure cute. Fantastic supporting cast. Amazing stars.

Highly recommend this movie.",1320278400,5,1217,4.6036866359447
4020980,3,B002ZG97M4,"Controversy always surrounds movies when it comes to remakes. Should ""Footloose"" have been made? Should ""Psycho"" have been remade? Absolutely not. ""Footloose"" though? Why not? The original is very dated and the elements that made the original ""Footloose"" so popular are still as timely and relevant today. It's the music and dancing that brought people to the cinemas back in 1984 for the original ""Footloose"" and today, movies like ""Step Up"", ""Save the Last Dance"" ""Stomp the Yard"" and ""Burlesque"" are just as popular. Yet ""Footloose"" seemed to rise to the top and has been touted as a classic, as far as dance movies go.

The new version of ""Footloose"" does a lot of things right and I would even go as far as to say that it takes absolutely nothing away from the original movie. They took some liberties with some scenes, putting their own twist on them. Most of the scenes are nearly identical. The script is nearly identical with the exception of the opening minutes that show the audience why the town of Bowmont has banned dancing and other things. Personally, I don't think this adds to the movie at all though. Since the main protagonist is Ren MacCormack, played by Kenny Worwald, a character who is new to the town and doesn't know these people anyway. I think not knowing the victims of the tragedy that caused the law against dancing makes more sense, and adds to the questioning of why the law exists in the first place.

Many of the scenes are too choreographed and those scenes take away from the realism and looking glass feel you should get from a movie. For instance, in the new version, the caf scene where the minister catches his daughter dancing is a full on blow out, up-in-the-club moment with choreographed craziness. It wasn't realistic and was way overblown. This wasn't always the case. Many of the revamped scenes are well done and much of the music has either been retooled or reused.

One of the more popular dance numbers in the original movie is when Wren blows off some steam in the warehouse to the song ""Never"". In the new version, the dance choreographer is preserved to a miserable, strange song that doesn't have near the moxie that ""Never"" did. Most of the songs are good enough to be memorable though, and Willard learning to dance to the song ""Let's Hear it for the Boys"" is one of the best scenes in the movie.

The biggest surprise of the movie though was the acting ability of Julianne Hough, who plays Ariel Moore, the preacher's daughter. Hough rose to fame as a dancer on ""Dancing with the Stars"" and ""Footloose"" is only her second movie. She did her part great justice, especially for someone who is a virtual novice. Miles Teller (Rabbit Hole), who plays Willard, also did a great job in only his second movie. In fact, he steals the show in many ways.

""Footloose"" is a good movie. It doesn't top the original or pale in comparison to it either. The original had a flow to it that can't be topped when you're trying to duplicate a movie and people like Kevin Bacon and John Lithgow pushed the original over-the-top. Nobody pushes the new version over the top like those two actors did, but the new version will certainly be enjoyed by young audiences of a new generation.",1320105600,2,3223,4.6276223776223775
4020981,5,B002ZG97M4,"Those Sunday shoes can be a little tiresome, especially when you are forced to wear them all week long.

Ren McCarthy arrives in the small town of Bomont, soon discovers dances are banned following a tragic accident several years earlier in which five high schoolers were killed.  Not only that, the blaring of music as you drive your car along a country road can get you fined.  He butts heads with police, preacher, and headmaster soon after.  He meets the attractive rebellious yet troubled preachers daughter, Ariel, played by Julianne Hough who blanks him.

Somewhere in town highschoolers can go and blare some music, but before long the authorities appear.  Ren dances and catches the eye of Ariel.  Her brother died in the accident, messing her up, and she acts out, thrillseeking, dangerously self destructive, she dates the local bad boy.  As the attraction grows, conflicts arise with both the preacher, and the bad boy.  Will Ren get her?  Will she change her ways?  Will they do the mambo?  If you're like me these are some of the questions that run through your mind as you watch this movie.

You have to watch the movie to find out.  Not having previously seen the original Footloose, I was curious to see this because of Julianne Hough, who has won twice on Dancing with the stars, and is a world champion ballroom dancer.  Kenny Wormald I had not heard of before.  He has danced professionally with some of the world's top entertainers such as Justin Timberlake, and I believe Mariah Carey.  I found his performance in his first leading role engaging, and clearly he has great dance skills.  Somewhat to my surprise I was impressed by the acting performance of Julianne Hough, she delivers in the several great emotional scenes this movie offers, particularly when she gets slapped.  I knew she could dance, and I did not recognise her in Burlesque, because she wore a brunette wig, but I think she could have a decent career as a leading movie actress.  Beyond her obvious appeal, she has some depth.

In some respects this is better than the original, particularly the storytelling, which includes the inciting incident of the accident at the beginning, and some of the dancing particularly by Kenny Wormald and others were very good.  What surprised me given the talent of Hough is that she was underused in a dancing capacity, and had no solo to speak of.

In some respects the original is better, particularly the depth of acting talent, which includes well known actors such as John Lithgow, and Dianne Wiest, as the preacher and his wife, whose characters were three dimensional, Kevin Bacon, of course, Sarah Jessica Parker in a supporting role as Ariel's friend, and a scene stealing Christopher Penn, Sean Penn's brother.

The best known actors in the new version are Dennis Quaid, and Angie McDowell, yet somehow the director played down the role of these characters so that they are one dimensional.

I think most people will enjoy both versions, with a new movie updated soundtrack with new artists.  I think the remake was worthwhile, because this version will appeal to a new generation that was not even alive when the first movie was made.  I think though we are seeing too many remakes this year.

If you want to watch another dance movie,  I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-Shoes-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00000IPHT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red Shoes - Criterion Collection</a>, one of the greatest dance movies ever made.",1319587200,,3524,5.048442906574395
4020982,4,B002ZG97M4,"This is a remake of an iconic 1980's film about a town that has banned dancing for its young residents.  A young man moves in from Boston and tries to change the law. This one features some very solid performances, and the interaction between the characters is the strong suit of the movie. There are some good dance sequences, and storyline is still a good fit for the modern era. Julianne Hough is a rebellious young woman trying to establish her own identity apart from being the preacher's daughter. She is terrific, as well as being absolutely gorgeous. This is a fun movie that I could see again.",1319328000,8,602,4.574074074074074
4020983,4,B002ZG97M4,"From Tom Cruise getting down in his tighty whiteys in ""Risky Business"" to Jennifer Grey having the time of her life in ""Dirty Dancing"", eighties movies were filled with great moments involving dancing.  They were one of a kind, and can't be recreated with the same impact.  If you asked me before I saw the reviews, I would have said that the cinematic world did not need a remake of ""Footloose.""  Mainly, because I can't think of a remake of an eighties' film that bettered the original. In this case, I've only seen bits of the original, so I thought this was pretty good.

 The plot is the same as the `84 version.  When a group of teens are killed in a drunk driving accident, the minister (Dennis Quaid) whose son has also died, and the town officials ban virtually everything teens do for recreation, including dancing. (Drag racing busses aflame, does get a pass.) Three years later, Bobby's younger sister, Ariel, played by Julianne Hough, is busy doing everything that's been banned and not caring if she's caught.  She also has the requisite bad boy older boyfriend, who doesn't respect her.  Naturally, she's a perfect match for new kid in town Ren (Kenny Wormald reprising the Kevin Bacon role), who's moved in with his uncle's family, following the death of his mom from cancer.  Ren is a good kid, but after a series of run-ins with the local authorities, he decides to cut loose, kick off his Sunday shoes and with his new friends, get the ban on dancing revoked.

The lead does a good job, but if you ask me, Miles Teller, playing Ren's pal who must overcome his fears of being a ""dancing dork"" stole the show.  Also excellent is Andie McDowell, in the role of the preacher's wife, who has stood by her man for too long and is about to tell him some uncomfortable truths.  Oh yes, and the dancing is totally awesome.",1318982400,51,1832,4.551829268292683
4020984,5,B002ZG97M4,"Like most folks I was sceptical when I sat down with my popcorn, but not for long.  Beginning the film with an actual dance was ingenious, and showing us the tragic accident immediately created the climate for the town of Bomont's overprotective atmosphere.

The director paid just the right amount of homage to the original with the use of the car, the red boots, and the similarity in the dance party attire.  The change in the mother's history in the new movie added to Ren's character arc.  Also, the new choreography, especially Ren's warehouse number, really made it surprising and exciting.

I wasn't the least bit disappointed at the script changes and was, in fact, impressed at how the writers were able to update the dialogue to make it more believable.  Ariel was actually more realistic in this version compared to the original, and I thought her chemistry with her Dad was more intense.

(Spoiler alert!) The only thing I missed was not seeing Ren's friend get busted up quite as bad at the C&W club as he did in the first movie.",1318723200,4,1043,4.666666666666667
4020985,5,B002ZG97M4,"Went to see this the weekend it came out. My wife and I loved it. They took the origninal film and added to it. More humour, better story telling.. Fantastic. This is a must have. I hope it will be released in time for Christmas, as my wife promptly told me exiting the cinema its on her Christmas list..",1318723200,3,304,4.169491525423729
4020986,2,B002ZG97M4,"I went into this movie really hoping they would do right by the original, which is a fine movie. After seeing the remake, it's very clear just how fine the original was. The remake failed to capture any of the spirit, youthful exuberance, or sincerity of the first one.

The script was the first problem. Very surprising since Dean Pitchford co-wrote it, and wrote the original. In his attempt to make the script more contemporary and relatable, he wrote out all the genuine emotion. Everything was explained to the point of hitting the audience over the head. Just one case in point: we start out by going straight to the fun toe-tapper of a theme song, everyone dancing, and a few seconds later BAM...we get emotionally jerked out of the feel-good fun time of hearing that nostalgic song and into the contrived sadness of Bobby's death, which paints too plain a picture of why Ariel is so rebellious and messed up. In the original, one simple conversation as they drive over the bridge after the night at the club, and Lori Singer's Ariel reacting to telling the story of Bobby's death was all we needed to feel her pain, and to finally understand, at the same moment Ren does, why she is the way she is. It was much more genuine and packed a much greater emotional punch than the remake's overly sappy church scene when Reverend Moore pours his heart out to the congregation. The bridge conversation just feels like overkill by that point.

The characters were also much more one-note and two-dimensional that the original characters. Julianne Hough's Ariel was just a little naughty and self-destructive. Lori Singer's Ariel was borderline crazy. You could see clearly that something very serious ailed her soul. Not so with Hough's Ariel. Even when the script again hits us over the head by having her tearfully come out and say ""I've been losing my mind"" you don't quite believe her in the way you knew Singer's Ariel was losing her mind, and she never even had to say a direct word about it. Ren's uncle was more like the mill boss in the original, and Ren's mom is gone altogether. Reverend Moore and his wife, Vi, portrayed by Dennis Quaid and Andie McDowell this time around, also felt flat and one-note. This seemed to be in part the way the characters were written, and in part how they were portrayed. Quaid and McDowell are fine, competent actors, but they simply cannot hold a candle to John Lithgow and the sublime Diane Wiest. McDowell's Vi betrays her own basic nature by shouting to get attention for Ren at the town hall meeting. But Wiest maintains Vi's quiet restraint and tendency toward deference in how she simply, and quietly says ""Eleanor, sit down."" And achieves even more impact than McDowell's out of character shouting. Likewise Quaid's Shaw Moore only had one level, barely  maintaining a calm and trying to hold things together. We never really see him struggle with the inner turmoil that Lithgow made so clear, and we never really see Qauid's Shaw smile. When he slaps Ariel, we don't really see what built up to lead him to do such a thing, and the fact that he does it when she is fresh from the beating by the bad ex boyfriend makes Quaid's Shaw far less sympathetic and relatable. Lithgow's Shaw never even found out about Ariel's run-in with Chuck, greater illustrating the chasm between daughter and parents. When Lithgow's Shaw smacks Ariel at the breakfast table in the original, we have a better understanding of why, and the tension between all three family members is much more palpable. In the conversation that follows, we can see Vi means the praise she gives Shaw, and in the same moment, when she says ""but it's the one on on where you need a little work"" we see her anger and frustration as well. Lithgow's and Wiest's performances made Shaw and Vi real, human and three-dimensional in a way Quaid and McDowell didn't even touch.

There was also very little if any exposition as to why the whole town put their youth on lockdown after the accident. There is no sense that the town is a powder keg ready to blow and the accident was just the match. The book burning incident, the town's irrational fear of anything modern or outside the acception convention, the discussion about the fired English teacher, Slaugherhouse Five, the sense of the mindset of the majority of the townsfolk, were all missing from this reboot.

I'm sure Footloose will make a nice load of  money, and it is not without entertainment value. But when it comes to quality, memorable teen films, the original will still go down in history, while folks say, ""did they ever do a remake of that?""",1318636800,8,4617,4.686806411837238
4020987,5,B002ZG97M4,"After a very long wait, I finally just saw the new Footloose film in the theater...
I could barely hold the excitment in any longer!!!
I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!

As a child of the 80's & probably the biggest Footloose fan of all time, I will say that if you go into this movie thinking that it will be the same Footloose you saw back in the 80's, you will probably be a bit surprised & maybe even disappointed.

After reading some previous articles/reviews from other sites, talking with people at work & friends etc... I found a lot of people who Hate the idea of this movie being re-made.
I also believe that most, if not all of these people wouldn't like the idea of any older film being re-made & think they believe films being re-made are bad before they even see them.
I can understand where these people are coming from, but to all of those people please give this movie a chance! Also, remember like me, the original Footloose will always hold a special place in your Heart, so even if you don't like this newer version, you won't lose the older version!!!
Futhermore, although this newer version of the Iconic Film has a lot of similarties to the old version, it isn't the Old version!!!
However, this Version of the film offers it's own STYLE & FLARE!!!

A lot of the scenes in the movie were near matches to scenes in the Original Footloose, and I really appreciated that, as it shows much Respect to the Original.
Also the same VW bug appeared, same tux jacket & similar outfits, hairstyles, quotes etc...

All the main actors did a Fantastic Job in their respective roles!!!

Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough had incredible on screen Chemistry & made a very good Ren & Ariel.
Julianne looked AMAZING & showed she can act & act well!!!
Kenny showed he can act as well & though he was no Kevin Bacon, he did one heck of a good job playing Ren.

Dennis Quaid played the strong willed Pastor, and he was very believable & real!

The new Williard did a good job... he was funny, showed his slow side(lol), had some great dance moves, and really fit the role well as his chemisty with Kenny Wormald was excellent!

The bad guy who played Chuck Cranston in the movie didn't seem to fit too well! I didn't like him near as much as Jim Youngs who played the bad guy in the Original Footloose.

The Dancing sequences were Amazing, and appropriate for todays style of dancing.
The songs/music were pretty good, but no match compared to the older Famous film Soundtrack that accompanied the original film.
They did manage to play the Kenny Loggins version of Footloose in the film, and I think they played the Deniece Williams version of Lets hear it for the boy, in which it was really nice to hear both of the original versions in this film.

Even though I like the Origianl Better, all in all I liked this Version of Footloose too. It was Exciting, Fun, Intense, High Spirited, Invigorating & was an AWESOME FLASHBACK to one of the Greatest movies of all time!!!

Please go & see the movie before judging it, and don't be too harsh on it, as nothing will replace the Original Version!

Thanks for reading my review!",1318550400,3,3119,4.462214411247803
4020988,4,B002ZG97M4,"When I heard they were remaking Footloose, my immediate reaction was to groan. It's a pretty cheesy movie in the first place, and in the High School Musical-influenced 21st century, I was sure it would be even worse.

I was completely surprised by this film when I had a chance to screen it last month. Director Craig Brewer (who also worked on the rewrite) has made an enjoyable movie in the spirit of the original Footloose, with its energy and fun, and possibly even surpassed it in heart.

In the remake, the characters seem more developed and real. I did not know how anyone could live up to the iconic Kevin Bacon Ren, but the writing (particularly the changes to the backstory) combined with his talent and likability make Kenny Wormald great in this role.

Setting it in the South added another dimension to the film. I found it familiar and the jokes hysterical as someone who lives in urban Memphis, but if you loathe anything country and Southern, be warned that this has its fair share of that vibe.

The original film has quite a bit of sex, drugs, drinking and violence, and I was curious as to how they would be handled in a remake, especially one that seemed a little more intense from the trailer. Overall, I thought the portrayals of ""risky behavior"" sent a better message than the original without coming off as hokey in the least.

It will be obvious to filmgoers that Brewer loves Footloose and wanted to do it justice in this remake. He pays tribute and yet develops the film as well. If you give it a chance, I think you will be pleasantly surprised as well.",1315612800,4,1581,4.533333333333333

4022645,5,B002ZG97M4,"I have watched this movie many times since 2011, and still think it is a great movie, a movie that will never get old from watching it too many times. The only thing about this movie i don't like is that it gets carried away with the no dancing laws. What i like about the movie is that there is a lot of excitement and also a lot that goes on during the movie and that keeps you on your toes. This is the type of movie that is going to make you want to get up and dance/ sing along with them. It has the catchiest songs you'll ever listen too and the easiest dances you can learn by just watching them. It is also the type of movie that gets down to business when it comes to their laws, especially when the preachers daughter is the one who breaks them the most behind his back. I highly recommend this movie because it is very upbeat and has a romantic love story some where in between if you like movies like that, but it isn't the kind that will have you crying into your bowl of popcorn at the end either. This is a movie for all ages, it takes place back in the 80's so even adults would enjoy the era in this movie to remind them of their good ole days being a teenager.",1458000000,,1178,3.9746835443037973

The fact that i have to pay to rent this. SERIOUSLY AMAZON???!!! Get with the times. I'm already paying you $90 for my prime account. Why would you even begin to think about charging your prime customers anything in addition?? I refuse to use amazon instant video. I got out-voted and tha'ts why this was rented. Netflix and Hulu are the streaming kings. If you want to step into the ring, ELIMINATE fees to watch videos (and an even higher premium to watch in HD (are you freaking kidding me??!! IT'S 2015 for god sake!!)) or just don't offer the videos that you want to charge money for.

4023779,3,B002ZG97M4,"Although the original ""Footloose"" was a cultural phenomenon when I was growing up (and happened to be the target age at the time) - I never liked the film.  It felt overwrought, over produced, and rather cheesy to me even then.  I dismissed it as ""targeted toward girls"" and I felt the characters were shallow.  But hey!  It was the 80's, and in that regard it was no different than myriad other films of the era.  Enter this remake.  Overall, this is a much better film.  It's more subtle (in most ways) and the characters have a little more depth.  Dennis Quaid is altogether human as the overprotective father that wants partying to be banned.  He has reasons, he is in pain. And he is not the caricature of a Bible-thumping preacher that John Lithgow (whom I love) came off as in the original film.  To be fair, Lithgow's portrayal was just as authentic to a certain type, especially for the time of the original film.  Although the film still has its dance montages and over the top moments, this remake infuses the story with some much needed subtlety and the characters with some believable dimension and humanity.",1425340800,,1121,4.611111111111111

4023869,3,B002ZG97M4,"I haven't seen the '84 original starring Kevin Bacon, so I didn't go into this with those kind of expectations. The plot is a fairly simple teens vs. adults story, so I also wasn't expecting anything terribly deep. And, now having finished it I would say that my limited expectations of at least being entertained were met. Beyond that, FOOTLOOSE is a very cliched teen drama that just happens to have good music and dancing sequences. The gist of the story is that a city kid, Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald) moves in with relatives who live in the sleepy southern town of Bomont, Georgia. Three years ago, after a tragic accident took the lives of five teenagers, the town council enacted a series of ordinances that aimed to prevent what caused it. Among those was an ordinance banning public dancing for those under 18 years of age.

 To me, such a set up is flimsy at best but the film worked with it in a decent, if pedestrian, way. On the surface is functions as story in which the rebellious teens face off against the stubborn, over-protective adults. But, towards the end, they manage to shoehorn a message about parents learning to trust their children. Nice, but a little too late if you ask me. The most interesting aspect of the film to me was the way in which it pits small-town life and values against real-world logic. I don't feel like the film ever disrespected people who live like that, but it wasn't exactly friendly towards them either. More problematic to me was a minister (Dennis Quaid) who wants to protect his daughter (Julianne Hough) against an abusive guy, yet slaps her across the face when she starts mouthing him off. That one scene came as an unwelcome surprise to me, and something which seemed completely out of character.

 In terms of acting, nobody was particularly bad. Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell came off looking the best, but I wouldn't place what they did here among their best work. As for Julianne Hough, let's just say she shouldn't abandon her singing and dancing careers. Kenny Wormald did fine as Ren McCormack but, like every other actor playing a teenager in this film, was utterly unconvincing as such. In terms of filmmaking quality, the cinematography and choreography was fine but unspectacular. Overall, it was a decent time-passer that was fitfully entertaining. It was a little too predictable for my tastes, and also not targeted to me, but that shouldn't stop teenagers enjoying it for the frivolous piece of entertainment that it is.

4023873,4,B002ZG97M4,"A remake of the iconic 1984 classic Footloose, I hadn't bothered to watch this in the years since it came out as I thought, what's the point of making a remake of a movie that is still part of popular culture in its original format?  But I had nothing at home to watch and this was sitting on a shelf and I thought, might as well give it a go, I did like Julianne Moore in Rock of Ages.  She does a decent job in this one but is somewhat underutilised compared to Rock of Ages.  Kenny Wormald does a pretty good job in Kevin Bacon's shoes too.  This version is pretty much a straight remake of the original so was kind of disappointing in that way, being that is set in the modern world of Ipods plugging into your cars speakers and other modern things, meant the storyline could have branched into areas the original couldn't, but it doesn't.  Being it's set today, they could have gone with the angle that Bacon's Footloose was a movie and they could have referenced and compared it to their reality own stupid laws such as the banning of dancing, which therefore would have made the rebellion scenes with the five year old girls make sense as to why they were dancing and singing to Let's Hear it For the Boy.  I hardly think that would be a song of choice for 5 year old girls.

Music wise the movie needed some modern songs, it still needed the classic Kenny Logins theme song and I thought they used that well at the start before the car crash.  This is also where they could have mentioned 84's Footloose as a movie if they had gone with that angle. The slow remake version near the end of the film of what was a fast dance song, just was terrible, I don't know who sang that, and I don't want to, I imagine they are quite embarrassed and don't want me to know either.  It's been about ten years since I last saw the 1984 original but don't remember a song about wanting to buy fake ID so you can get into the bar as there's a band you're dying to see.  I quite liked this song but was a poor decision to have the pub housebound that is singing it being old men.  These might well be the original artists, I have no idea but if you're not going to get Loggins back, why not get a younger band that could pass for pretending to be the 17 year old character in the song?

The law of the town banning dancing was a bit of a stretch in 1984 and even more so in a modern day setting to be believable.  You could imagine in today's world a cop pulling over a driver for having music playing and giving them a ticket for it being filmed on someone's phone and becoming the laughing stock of the world as it goes viral on Youtube. I don't remember the school bus demolition derby being in the 1984 version but it didn't make sense the town would be fine with this, being the catalyst was a fatal car accident, yet ban dancing.

If your DVD version has deleted scenes you'll see one where Ren is challenged by his football teammates as to what can you do and does some mad gymnastic moves on the chin up bars, acrobatically flying between them, thoroughly impressing and gaining the respect of the other students.  That was a brilliant scene I don't know why they left that out. What they should have left out though was the girlfriend of a minor character glassing a guy she was using to make her boyfriend jealous who won a fight that was provoked by the boyfriend.  That kind of thing might have been acceptable in the 80's but you do some serious jail time for coward punches or glassing in today's world.

As a remake movie it's pretty good, but when you finish you do wonder what the point of making it was when the original did and still does the job.",1421193600,,3656,4.222381635581062

Julianne Hough and Kenny Wormald do a fantastic job as Ariel and Ren, and Dennis Quaid does a outstanding job with every role he plays. In the original, Ren's uncle isn't supportive of Ren and what he wants to do in Bomont.  I felt as if the uncle almost didn't want Ren in his home. In the remake, Uncle Wes is very supportive of Ren and goes out of his way to stand up for him and help him as much as he can. The dancing was awesome and couldn't be compared to. It made you want to get up and start dancing to !  I liked how they told about the accident that claimed the lives of the teenagers and set up the story line. I thought it was very sensitive. They didn't try to ""hype"" it or make it larger than life. It was a tragic accident that has  happened before, only it shook the town of Bomont to it's core. I highly recommend this movie.

That said, this one did not totally suck but it was not great either.  The plot was expected and the acting was pretty good. My main problem with the movie is the b*tched up soundtrack.  The original soundtrack was great! The new versions of the old songs are redone by a bunch of country artists (Yuck). Trying to watch this movie (which is so dependent on it's soundtrack) was like nails on a chalk board. I became so distracted by the bad music that it made it difficult to pay attention to what was on screen. Thank God they left the Quiet Riot song alone!

Like in the first one they did a tractor race and that was just two people racing. Now in this movie they raced with old school buses and there were more then the two of them. Miles Teller, I feel he .didn't come across as being strong, He made me think that one good punch and he would be in lala land. Were Chris Penn was bulky and he looked strong, he looked like the country boy that worked all day lifting hay at a farm. Now Miles did wonderful with the dancing. I loved the music and all the dancing in this. I loved also that they tried to play the same songs that the first movie had and they did a lot of the songs, but they were alittle different. Then the ending I felt was so nice that they played the same last song of Kenny Logins and did the same last dance that Kevin Bacon did. That was awesome. This movie will be one that I will watch over and over. I probably be play the first one and comparing them. This is a movie that the whole family can watch.  Its about two teens that live in this town that as a law on rock and roll music and dancing. So this boy comes to this town to live and the people feel that he is bad and a troublemaker. The girl is the daughter of the preacher and she is just rebelling against her dad. So they both get together and start dating. He gets the town to change and allow them to have a dance.

I sat there thinking,  ""ok, those words were with this situation"" or ""this situation was this way or in this location""...in the original  I expected it to be a bit more edgy than the original  but found that it was, actually, a little more family friendly than the first--the female lead is a bit less racy in the remake than in the original.

Not a big C&W music fan, but the music is kicky enough to make even me want to dance.  Kenny Wormald NAILED the Boston accent...don't know where's he really from, but he's spot on.  The only other non-native I can think of in recent memory to do a faithful Boston accent (one of the hardest accents out there) is Cliff Clavin from Cheers, lol.  I kept replaying certain areas where Wormald was particularly skillful--made me think of home.  (Just looked it up while writing this, and it turns out the young Mr. Wormald is from Boston; I'm glad to see they didn't try to drum his accent out of him yet!)

I was already a big Julianne Hough fan--she was terrific in Burlesque. She has such a brightness about her, and she's talented and graceful.  Miles Teller as Willard was a riot, and a great dancer at that.  This was just one of those movies that lent itself well to an upgrade, and they didn't change the fundamental story.  I actually liked the changes; the circumstances set up for these young people were well-explained (no spoiler alerts in case someone hasn't seen it yet) and provided enough tension to force the challenge to Bomont's laws.  Lots of positive and meaningful messages here for younger people as well as adults.  Two thumbs up on this one!",1398124800,,1443,4.448669201520913

4024761,5,B002ZG97M4,"Okay..

  I am old... yes... old... and I remember the 1st one and it was excellent for it's time, the remake stands up to it and maybe even does it a bit better as they give more information on why exactly the idea of the no-dance policy and how in the end you can not stop your children from growing up.. also just telling your kids now adays to NOT do something is a sure fire way to get them to do it., kids like to rebel however kids now adays do it the wrong way.. in this movie I like to think they did it the right way.

4025022,3,B002ZG97M4,"I watched this movie out of boredom & also because I wanted to see how it compared to the 80s version that I loved as a teenager.  I did enjoy this version. However,like other reviewers, I am not sure why they did this remake.  The story was very true to the original, but it just doesn't translate well to today.  The idea that a town would ban dances and other such activities seemed completely plausible back in 1984, but in 2011, when this version was made, I can't imagine that happening.  I was also disappointed in the soundtrack choices for this flick.  Terrible remakes and nothing else really worth listening to.  The actors gave solid performances and some great dance moves.  But I agree with others that have said ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."".  The 1980s version was much better in my opinion.  This version could have been better if they had taken the original story and given it a grittier 2011 twist rather than staying so true to the original.  With that said, this one is fun & worth a watch if you are curious like I was, but don't expect anything spectacular. . .",1395532800,,1089,4.454545454545454

It crashed at the box office. It was phenomenally unpopular for a reason.

This is not so much a ""remake""  as an ""insult"" to the original movie.
The problem is with Kenny Wormald. He is so hopelessly miscast in the ""Renn"" role that it is painful to watch.
The movie becomes a big black hole every time he comes into the scene.
Wormald lacks charm. He totally lacks sex appeal. He plays his scenes with Julianne Hough as if she was his Sister.

4025425,1,B002ZG97M4,"I've seen plenty of remakes in my day and I have nothing against them, in fact some are even better than the original.  Oceans 11 comes to mind.  That being said, the new Footloose just doesn't cut it.  Admittedly, I couldn't even watch it to the end, I stopped at around the bus duel scene, but here's my real problem with the movie. The new actors look the same as the old actors, new Willard looks like old Willard, new Ariel looks like old Ariel, the dresses are the same, just shorter.  The dialogue in most places was basically taken out of the script from 1984 and the scenes almost always mirror each other.  Then all of a sudden you have a 4 bus figure 8 race to replace the tractor duel so at one moment everything is consistent and the next nothing is.  Also, sometimes the songs are the originals sung by the originals, like Deniece Williams singing 'Lets Hear it For The Boy', but 'Dancing in the Sheets' was definitely not Shalamar.
Like I said, I shut it off halfway through, but I did go back and fast forward to key scenes, like Willard learning to dance and the final fight/dance scene just to see how they destroyed those and I was right, they did.  Especially the final dance.  '84 had a bunch of kids that could dance a little and maybe a couple that were really good, but believable for a group of high school kids from the middle of nowhere.  In 2011, Bomont appears to be the epicenter of the dance world.  Every dancer looks professionally trained and ready for Broadway or some Las Vegas show.
If their plan was to take an iconic 80's film and twist it around to make a few dollars off the name then they hit it spot on.  For those of us that remember seeing this in '84 though, you're going to be sorely disappointed.  Watching the old footloose now, we all know it was a little cheesy, they let the cheese ferment for those 30 years when they remade this and gave Footloose a bad name.

I know this is putting a lot of pressure on Julianna, but since I am LDS, and she was raised with the same morals, I had high hopes that she'd keep it classy.  I realize that she had to portray a certain character, but she could have done it in more modest clothing and with less ""stripper"" dancing.  I bet most people would have appreciated less vulgarity overall.  I know that it would have been an even better and more entertaining movie without all this.  That being said, anyone who gave bad reviews on the acting is forgetting the acting in the original . . . give me a break!  I did love the soundtrack.  While I was disappointed that Julianna Hough didn't raise the bar on the moral side of thing, I did think her acting was good, and I still have high hope for her future because she knows and I know that she is a daughter of God and always will be.",1389398400,,928,4.179775280898877

I have liked Julianne Hough for a long time from ""Dancing With the Stars"" and I thought she was adequate in the part but thought the male lead was not good and his solos seemed more gymnastic than dance.",1388707200,,485,4.094736842105263

4026322,2,B002ZG97M4,I guess since I grew up watching the original this version was not for me.  For me you have to like the main characters and want them to succeed.  I did not care for the actor playing Wren nor for the overly slutty preacher's daughter.  I will say the movie went into more detail about the events leading up to Wren showing up and the reason the town was not allowed to dance.  The bus figure 8 race was cool.

4026389,4,B002ZG97M4,"[Rounded up from 3-1/2 stars] I grew up in the 80s, so I was skeptical about the remake, but I gave it a fair shot and was pleasantly surprised by this fresh reboot of an 80s gem (with Kevin Bacon being the lead in the original).  I never thought I'd say this, but I will now:  the original and the remake are like apples and oranges; I like'em both, each in their own way.  The young leads, Kenny Wormald (who landed the role of ""Ren,"" apparently after a lot of actor shuffling, including Zac Efron, who was originally cast as Ren) and Julianne Hough (""Ariel"") are good and energetic, but the real find here is the charismatic Miles Teller as Ren's buddy ""Willard"" (played by the late Chris Penn in the original), so one can't help but wonder what he might have been like as Ren instead (just a thought).  Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell are also very welcome in their parental supporting roles and are like getting a warm hug from the 80s.  Of course, if you've seen the original a hundred times, like me, there were no surprises in the plot (being a remake, though, maybe that unnecessary fight sequence at the end could have been edited out, especially since the movie was about 15 minutes too long), but those very familiar-looking scenes (almost shot for shot), including surprisingly effective father-daughter scenes between Quaid and Hough (""Daddy, guess what? We're dancing""), bring back some great memories, from the original and from the 80s in general.  Not sure the current teen crowd will go for it, with perhaps some slightly dated sequences, but this movie, I'll now admit, ultimately won me over.",1388188800,,1614,4.6855123674911665

I loved the original ""Footloose"" with Kevin Bacon, but this one is so terrible in acting and music, I hardly have the words to describe my utter disappointment. If Holly""dump"" has the need to remake a great classic, at least don't bug us with silly ""c""rap music and hip-hop dancing. I think we have enough of that on the streets and on TV. I also believe because of some ridiculous and slutty dance moves, this movie should be rated PG-17. My 14 year old watched both, the original first and than this horrific remake. She turned the remake off after the first 20 minutes. Even she thinks the original was WAY better and the remake a terrible attempt by Holly""dump"" to make money off a great movie.

After watching this I went out and browsed for the original Footloose and bought that, just to remind myself how good the music was.

4026524,3,B002ZG97M4,"I'm twenty something, I've seen tons of dance-movies and I really liked the original. This movie was hit and miss all the way. Some parts were good others felt 'cut in'. The actors...I really don't know what's up with trying to pass off older actors as teens. Doesn't make sense to me. It's bareable sometimes- some people have 'young genes' like the actors in Highschool Musical. But it was painfully obvious these guys were not in Highschool.

The second thing is that it's too extreme- in some movies directors/writers will write the most dramatic extreme thing they can think of to keep you watching. It doesn't work, it just feels chaotic from one scene to the next. It lacks that flow that takes you through the story. On top of that it just rushes from one topic to another.

Another thing is the music- there have got to be way way better songs than the ones chosen for this movie. A lot of it was just noise. Not even good noise.

If you can sit through it- kudos to you. Honestly, an hour into the movie I checked how much time was left and decided not to sit through yet another hour of watching this. At least not tonight, lol. To the point- there are MUCH better movies out there. This is just okay, a very low okay. I definitely don't recommend this for kids- or anyone really. I don't understand the high ratings but to each his own I guess.

The first reason I gave it 3 stars is because if the plot, the actors, the overall flow of the movie had been more thought out and refined it could've actually made sense. If it weren't a remake of the original footloose, and just it's own movie it would've been better. The second reason is that SOME of the dancing is good- if you over look the jerking, twerking, and occasional pole dancing, it has some pretty decent steps. Oh yea, the main actor wasn't too bad- kudos to him!",1385856000,,1838,4.381231671554252

4026683,3,B002ZG97M4,"It was okay. In some ways, better than the original, and in other ways, not as good as the original. Mostly about the same, but overall I don't think it was as good as the original.

Spoiler alert! The rest of this review contains detailed descriptions of the plot.

Better than the original:

Ren being from Boston instead of Chicago. Although it was kind of bogus that he never once mentioned anything particular to Boston (such as the Red Sox, stuff like that), it somehow worked better to have him be from Boston.

Setting it in the South rather than the West. Again, it just makes more sense that way, I think.

Worse than the original:

No good scenes of Ren doing gymnastics. What's the point of that plot element if we only see it indirectly through his dancing? The gymnastics talent was cool, and I wish it had been more evident in this remake.

Andie MacDowell was nowhere near as good as Dianne West. But I don't really think MacDowell is a particularly good actor in the first place, so I was not surprised.

Dialogue changes. Pretty much everywhere they changed the dialogue, they made it worse. There were a few good modifications, but the majority of the modifications made the scenes worse rather than better. For example, cutting the ""What did David do? . . . What did David do?"" line. I don't know why they cut that line--maybe Wormald couldn't pull it off the way Bacon could, or maybe they just didn't think it added anything--but it is one of the most famous lines in the movie, and it was just silly for them to remove it.

The same:

Kenny Wormald did a good job. I am a little biased toward Kevin Bacon for this role, but I think Wormald did fine as well. The girl who played Ariel also did a fine job. Dennis Quaid also did a good job, maybe as good as John Lithgow.

Overall plot is fairly comparable to the original.

-----

All things considered, this remake is okay and worth watching for fans of the original movie, but just go into it with low expectations and let the movie exceed your expectations.",1385078400,,2032,4.45945945945946

I like Julianne Hough's part but as far as the other actors ~ even though they did a good job ~ they were not as good as the actors in the old movie.  It would be hard to replace Kevin Bacon as well as pastor and wife.  There were parts of the new movie that I think were better (such as his uncle's supportiveness).

This is definitely a product I would recommend to all those who love the new version of footloose.",1380672000,,266,4.235294117647059
4026953,4,B002ZG97M4,Good fun entertaining movie. Just as enjoyable as the original.  The dance scenes showed some modern flare and the dialog was appropriate for the movie.,1380672000,,152,5.08
4026954,3,B002ZG97M4,I enjoyed how the adapted it to today.  it was Descent and entertaining.  Check it out today if it is free.,1380672000,,107,4.0476190476190474

4026956,3,B002ZG97M4,I guess this movie is ok for younger people. Actors did an ok job but the story line was a disappointment. It portrayed Minister daughters as slutty people.,1379894400,,156,4.607142857142857
4026957,3,B002ZG97M4,"movie was okay, had scratch on disk, and cover had few scratches and a tear in it,but I guess you get what you pay for! I only paid few bucks so it was okay!",1379721600,,157,3.6470588235294117
4026958,4,B002ZG97M4,"The acting isn't as good (not that it is stellar in the first Footloose) but the dancing is better, I think.  And the story is improved.  Our hero's host is more of a character, and the modifications to the story made it less cartoony and less cringeworthy, especially as the wives are involved.

All in all, worth watching, but not sure you need both.",1378166400,,352,4.46875
4026959,5,B002ZG97M4,Always a great watch whether the old version or the new.  My teenage grandchildren wanted to see it and was for the most part appropriate enough to watch.,1378080000,,154,4.5

4027133,3,B002ZG97M4,"The original is better, but Julianne Hough is far better looking than Lori Singer. I wasn't really happy that Ren was from Bahston instead of Chicago, and I could have done without the Southie Good Will Hunting accent. Overall, I'm not sorry I watched it, but I wouldn't watch it twice.",1377561600,,286,4.627450980392157

4027136,1,B002ZG97M4,"This movie is an insult to Psalm 150. The music and dance are insults and confusion to descent Christians. It is an insult to many good preachers' kids. Yet, it gives us the picture of today's morality standard in USA, a confused society who couldn't decide what is right and what is wrong.",1377216000,,290,4.490566037735849

4027138,1,B002ZG97M4,Inane story without any decent acting.  Even Dennis Quaid was kind of lame in this.  I guess I should say that I wasn't a big fan of the original either.,1376956800,,153,4.066666666666666

4027282,4,B002ZG97M4,"Overall a good and entertaining movie. I would not recommend it for small children since it does have some violence in it (fights, gun shots, blood etc.)",1376611200,,153,4.703703703703703
4027283,4,B002ZG97M4,A great remake of a classic - make you wanna get up and dance movie. Still love Kevin Bacon in the original too.,1376611200,,112,3.9130434782608696
4027284,1,B002ZG97M4,updating this movie was pointless as placing it in modern times just doesn't fly or feel real.  Stick to the original movie.,1376524800,,124,4.636363636363637

4027288,4,B002ZG97M4,This is a relevant rendition of the original movie Footloose. I liked it because they didn't just redo the original with a new cast. There is originality in the screenplay that still does the basic plotline of the original movie justice. I recommend it. It's a good movie and entertaining :-),1376179200,,292,4.745098039215686
4027289,5,B002ZG97M4,The old movie was really good and generally when they do a remake it's not as good but I think it's just as good as the first one.,1376179200,,130,3.6785714285714284

4027439,4,B002ZG97M4,it was a fun fast moving musical movie. I would recommend it to my friends and family to watch anytime,1376179200,,102,4.15
4027440,5,B002ZG97M4,"So romantic, funny and the music is awesome.  I would love to learn how to dance like that as well.",1376092800,,99,3.95

4027442,3,B002ZG97M4,not sure what the significance of a more current version of the original is.  Would just as soon watch the original.,1375833600,,116,4.523809523809524

4027444,1,B002ZG97M4,"I had to force myself to continue watching after the incredibly cheesy opening credits intro.  It was hard to get past that, but I tried, unsuccessfully.  I don't think I made it 20 minutes in.  Bad acting, horrible music, cheesy at best.  If you love the original Footloose (as I do), then don't watch this.",1375660800,,308,4.545454545454546

4027447,4,B002ZG97M4,Better than the original.....Kenny Wormald & Julianne Hough can dance!  Different enough from original to keep the viewers interest and entertained.,1374883200,,148,6.0476190476190474
4027528,5,B002ZG97M4,Of course the 1st movie is better. It was not what I expected but at least I able to watch it with any problems.,1374710400,,112,3.7083333333333335
4027529,3,B002ZG97M4,"There was not much new here.  It was more contemporary, of course, but that's about it.  There are better remakes.",1374710400,,114,4.65
4027530,4,B002ZG97M4,"Different than the first one. Enjoyed seeing updated actors in this fun movie. I would have like the main character to be unpacked more about his relationship with his mom, lots of talk but not a lot of emotion.",1374537600,,211,4.435897435897436
4027531,4,B002ZG97M4,It gave a more modern twist to the classic with Kevin Bacon.  I don't think the father played by Dennis Quaid was as good as the original.,1374451200,,138,4.111111111111111
4027532,4,B002ZG97M4,I was worried that the integrity of the movie would be lost but it was a wonderful surprise.  I enjoyed it!,1374451200,,107,4.095238095238095
4027533,1,B002ZG97M4,"rented this movie and watched only half of it until all three of us watchers agreed that we wished no more to sit there watching such emptiness of life substance.  no real connections between characters, just circumstances and the circumstances were so dry and devoid of kindness and life affirming connections that we didn't want to sit through such a bleak depiction of life....",1374451200,,380,4.9375
4027534,2,B002ZG97M4,I love the original and so this one just really redoing what they did I found cheesy.  Many of the lines and actions where exactly the same as the original.  I think when you remake a movie you should try to make it fresh and new this really didn't do that.,1374364800,,257,4.019607843137255
4027535,3,B002ZG97M4,I was disappointed with this movie.  It was an insult to the old movie.  Waste of money. Buy something else.,1374364800,,108,4.35
4027536,4,B002ZG97M4,The movie was very good and I may watch it again. The music is very good but when compared to the first one it does lack a bit.,1374364800,,127,3.5714285714285716
4027537,4,B002ZG97M4,It seemed as if it was a little updated but basically the same movie as the classic. The dancing was good but it just couldn't eclipse the original. It was fun to watch.,1374364800,,169,4.151515151515151
4027797,5,B002ZG97M4,Just put Jullian in it and you need not say more. Story line was changed but would highly recommend it,1374278400,,102,4.15

It was not very good and I stopped watching about halfway through.",1374278400,,134,4.4

4027801,1,B002ZG97M4,This movie should have been re-imagined.  With only a few exceptions this was a direct copy of the original with updates to the dance moves to fit the current time.  In one particularly bad scene where the heroin does this angry dance in the old abandoned warehouse they did almost the same sequence of moves for the actor but used different music which totally didn't fit.  Dennis Quaid and julianne hough were the only bright spots in the movie,1374019200,,446,4.620253164556962
4027802,4,B002ZG97M4,i like this movie just as much as the first  one what a great eye opener for me well tell people to give it a try,1373846400,,113,3.3461538461538463
4027803,4,B002ZG97M4,"It's just a remake of the first, not a retelling, but it's still fun to watch. The actors are pretty good and the dancing is cool. It's fun cute movie, maybe a little less heavy than the original, but still good.",1373500800,,212,4.195121951219512
4027804,3,B002ZG97M4,I am of the opinion that songs and movies should not be covered (remade) unless it is better than the original. Just updating to current time does not do it. That is all they have done here - best. They made some of the characters a little closer to real human behavior instead of so stereotypically (Hollywierd) bad in the original so that redeems it some.,1373500800,,357,4.424242424242424
4027805,5,B002ZG97M4,"When I heard that Footloose was being made, I was angry. You never want to mess up a classic. However, I saw this in theaters and was pleasantly surprised.

4027998,5,B002ZG97M4,"I liked the original so much that I didn't know if I would like the remake, but it stayed true to the original and after the first few minutes I stopped comparing the new actors to the old ones and just enjoyed it!",1372982400,,214,4.0
4027999,3,B002ZG97M4,"I grew up with Footloose so I am a little more critical of this.  Thy did a good remake, making it more modern but still like the old one better.",1372982400,,145,3.8333333333333335
4028000,5,B002ZG97M4,"A modern take on a classic.  Might be a little mindless entertainment, but it has great music, good story, and outstanding balance between new and old movie.  Highly recommended.",1372982400,,178,5.103448275862069
4028001,1,B002ZG97M4,They did not remake this movie.  No.  NO.  Tell me they did not remake this movie.  Please tell me.  Tell me it's not true.  Tell me that Hollywood - as terrible as it is - did not remake this stinkbomb of a movie.  I simply refuse to believe it.  No one could be that stupid. No.,1372896000,,280,3.875
4028002,3,B002ZG97M4,Its not as good the first one.  It's too fake and I'm surprised to see good know actors in this projects.  the music was fun to dance with again though,1372896000,,151,4.0
4028003,4,B002ZG97M4,Mindless movie for a relaxing evening.  I wasn't disappointed.  Lots of fun and energy in the movie.  Very Good flick.,1372809600,,118,4.8

4028139,3,B002ZG97M4,"Where to begin, some movies really do not need to be remade and here is a perfect example. It was an ok flick if you haven't seen the original. Again something's are better left untouched",1372291200,,187,4.371428571428571
4028140,5,B002ZG97M4,I really liked this Footloose as well some things we're not as good as the first one but other than that it was great movie,1372118400,,123,3.96

Great movie, my second fav to Great Gatsby, but trust me this movie probably didn't cost anything compared to that million dollar production.

I love love love this and I hope Amazon comes with new movies and keep this one to!!!",1371772800,,383,4.787878787878788

I'm not a great dancer, but I really enjoyed seeing how Ren, Willard, Ariel, and the Reverend changed throughout the movie and how they changed the town. I can't go into details without giving away parts of the movie but I highly recommend it!",1371427200,,381,4.380281690140845

It was different enough to distinguish it from the original. However, a lot of the lines were the same so it was very familiar. Dueling tractors are no more... it has adapted. The dancing is also updated. Ren (Kenny) is amazing! He has a different approach than Kevin Bacon had with the role and did a fantastic job. I have started looking for his movies so I can see more. I couldn't believe they found a talented actor/dancer to play Willard who looks so much like Chris Penn. Some people have trashed his performance. He did an excellent job in such an iconic role. I was also impressed with Julieanne Hough. She's a good dancer, but I didn't know what her acting was like. She did a good job as Ariel.",1369785600,,848,4.339622641509434

I thought it was pretty cute back then...but when I watched THIS version, it made me want to go back and see the original for comparison. I did that, and now will most likely watch THIS ONE again, and I am thinking that this was the better offering. I will get back on this. Both were entertaining, but I am finding that the original NOW seems cumbersome and a little boring in some places.

This remake is a fresh update on a classic original and definitely worth the time to watch. Hough and Wormald do a wonderful job as the young teens; Quaid and McDowell are wonderful as the preacher and his wife. It's a rollicking good time!,1367712000,,408,4.298701298701299

4028982,1,B002ZG97M4,"As a stand alone movie, I may have given this as high as two stars. My 8 year old daughter laughed a couple times and shook her butt to the music. But that would assume I had never heard of or seen the orignial. When watching the remake and having knowledge of the original, this receives ZERO stars. It's as if someone found a 25 year old movie script and said ""ok, lets make THIS movie. We don't even need to make any changes. It's fine as it is."" The script was virtually the same as the original. The original had moderately funny dialogue performed by good actors, and it worked. Take that same dialogue and give it to these modern day ""actors"" and it does not work. I can't tell if the writing didn't hold up well over time or if the main characters were just that bad.

To me the acting seems a bit off and there are some elements that were changed but at the same time they stuck so close to the original script I almost got a sense of deja-vu. A bit disappointing for me since I can't shake the memories of the original but I think a new generation, seeing it for the first time, would probably find it just as entertaining as I do the original.",1366502400,,627,4.367521367521367
4029155,5,B002ZG97M4,"Two Rising Stars are Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough on their way to making it in the Acting, Dancing, Singing, and Popularity categories of our times.  Director Craig Brewer did a wonderful directing job of bringing a movie up from the 1984 version to the 2011 era we are now living.  At 65 I could of gotten up and danced along with them and guess what I did.  Change of story just enough to make it right for today's teens.  Dennis Quaid and Andy McDowell were perfect as the preacher and his wife they even made the movie more realistic by being in it.

Trust is a big issue and if they do not earn your trust in them then a time out or grounding is correct for any teen.  Once they know you are the parent and not their Friend, as well as NOT buying their Love.  This helps them Respect you, as the parent and the teens will be trustworthy and make each parent proud to say that is my son or daughter.

No child is perfect at what ever age they grow because of our guidance and values, as well as morals.  We as parents make mistakes and own up to those mistakes to your children and you will be shown to them as Human Beings and not Fakes......

His opinion is it is fast paced, entertaining with excellent dancing and well worth watching again (we had seen it at the theater). And he put it on his wish list so I bought it. My opinion is it is a pale poor imitation of the original",1363996800,,389,3.875

Maybe it's just the way movies are made now, and maybe the story was told a little better, filling in and expanding on gaps the original missed. This one did a great job of keeping with the storyline of the original, even keeping a lot of the original music, although updated a little bit. Maybe I'll have to re-watch the original to see if I missed something when I saw it last, 15 years ago or so. If you haven't seen this one yet, do so.",1363046400,,554,4.045454545454546

I would have liked a lot more dancing in the movie, but it kept quite true to the original story, with some modernization where necessary.  The acting seemed a little forced at times, and I can't say I felt as sympathetic for the characters in this version as I did the original, but that might just be because the plot seems less plausible in a more modern era.

4030268,5,B002ZG97M4,"I saw the original Footloose movie in the theater.  I was more into Metal and didn't care much for the movie at the time.  Now, being much older, I love the original and I am Proud to say I saw it in the theater back in the 80's.  Recently, remakes of all of the movies that I grew up with are coming out almost every day it seems.  I cringe when I hear it.  These are the movies of my youth - the ones that I loved so I don't want them re-made because I love them as they are. No one has any creativity or imagination - they need to go to the 80's for inspiration and re-make material.  So, going into this movie - this new remake of Footloose I had very low expectations.

It was outstanding.  They nailed it - this is a remake not a re-do.  It's a remake and then some basically.

Each scene was recreated and some were added to help with the story.  I was able to anticipate what each line was - analyzed it and they did it right - all they way up to the Ariel kiss - my favorite part of the original.  I like how Ariel gives Ren the bible as a gift and not the music box - Ren was more excited to have the bible to help him than a music box.  However, I revert back to the original - my love - I did like how the music of the music box then carried over into the movie score as they kissed - love it.  Speaking of music - this sound track must be pretty good - there were not any songs in the movie that I didn't like - much like the music from the original.  We see the accident on the bridge in the beginning which sets the pace.  Also, seeing a small music video of Ren assembling the Bug with Quiet Riot was awesome and beats the quick 4 second sound bite in the original - the metal head in me :)

The casting was well done - each character was spot on and in some cases a match to the original.  If you are a fan of the 80's flick this new remake won't let you down - it is actually a tribute to you and me.  Everything was masterfully done and remade to work and not be at the least bit awkward and ridiculous. With that said the acting was pretty good -

Please see it if you are a fan and an old 42 year old like me :)",1361318400,,2132,3.8132118451025057

I did not like the way they used some of the old songs and updated them. My children did not like the old movie so it's a wash I guess. I did enjoy the way they expanded the story from the original to show more background about why the town was so against music and dancing.

I mean visuals don't make a moviehowever special effects is there to take the movie on a journey with good story line not be the storyline because storyline was rushed just to sell another picture. Case in point the girl with the dragon tattoo I mean come on guys really. Noomi rapace made that movie better than an international movie should have been.  Daniel Craig was good as well as rooney but it just to me lost something in the cast that made the movie. Julianne huff is very pleasent on the eyes but the movie was crap compared predecessor. Ms huff will have a good carreer I think though.,1360800000,,742,4.3768115942028984

The protagonist's accent comes and goes throughout the movie.  Whenever someone mentions Boston, he'll remember that he's supposed to have the accent, but the rest of the time, it's just flat.  Julianne Hough is cute, but not a great actress, and she doesn't get to show off much dancing, which seems like a shame.

4030563,3,B002ZG97M4,"Unlike the recent Fame reboot, this remake provides solid retelling of the town where dancing has been banned.

On top of that, I felt that most of the characters lost something in the translation.  I really didn't have any reason to feel anything for any of them.  I don't want to blame the acting, but something with the changes in story or how key scenes were played out just left me wishing I was watching the original instead.  In the end the movie is watchable, but I would feel very sorry for anyone who might watch this one having never seen the original, because they probably wouldn't even give the original a chance afterwards... and that is where all the magic of this story is.  One last thing to add for argument to watch the original over a remake... Kevin Bacon.  Enough said.",1360368000,,841,4.387096774193548

The stripper-style dancing and swearing weren't neccesary in the classic, why is it needed here?  The actors were sub-par and made the storyline not believable.

4030873,5,B002ZG97M4,"I was in High School in NH when the orignal movie came out.  I remember sitting between 2 of my friends and letting the movie take me to this magical world where music and dance could unite a community.  When we left the theater, my car was covered with snow, and I remember taking the snow brush out of my trunk and doing the ""footloose"" dance to my cassette of Quiet Riot (in the movie) while my friends cheered me on.  One of the best memories I have of being a teenager.

My teen years are, well, over 20 years behind me, so this movie means a lot to me.  When I heard they were remaking it, I was not happy.  I began watching this movie with a well deserved hatred.  How dare they mess with my memories??!!  Outside of the bus racing scene, this is an absolutely A++++ revision of the original.  The current version is respectful of the movie it is based on without being a lame carbon copy.  The leads are under appreciated actors and incredible dancers.  I defy anyone of my age (46) to watch the new Ren teach his best friend to dance and not remember Kevin Bacon teaching Chris Penn to dance.

This movie has the heart and soul of the original, while giving it a time-sensitive make over.  No Gen Y or Z kid will watch an 80's movie, but they will watch this.  Finally, a movie we can all enjoy!  You can fly if you'd only cut loose!",1357689600,,1342,4.1875
4030874,2,B002ZG97M4,"I think it hurts Hollywood to give new movies a chance - choosing to stick to formulaic hits that worked in the 80s - and regurgitating them for todays audience.  Why mess with what was perfection?  Not every film needs a ""remake"", several""sequels"" or now the addition of ""prequels"".  Take a chance on less grand productions and make some of these Indy filmmakers box office gold.  This movie was almost an exact take on the 80s version with none of the real chemistry or acting chops (K. Bacon).  Two thumbs dowm.....and two big toes!",1357689600,,535,4.648936170212766
4030875,5,B002ZG97M4,"I was leary about getting this movie, but I absolutely LOVE how they kept it so close to the original. What I really liked is how they changed Uncle Wes to be more laid back, giving the little girls much more acting in the movie, and most of all how they brought Vi into a more outgoing woman, rather than seeing her (in the original) just sit back and keep her mouth shut. Overall, I absolutely love this movie, but still watch the original now and then too. And the soundtrack to this updated version is absolutely fantastic!!",1357516800,2,528,4.3979591836734695

My opinion on a movie though, if you are going to remake something to be more updated, then update it.  The dancing, for the most part, was out of date except in the beginning of the movie.  Otherwise, well done.",1357516800,,364,4.084507042253521

The one thing I can note about it is that even though it is Ultraviolet they actually include a code for an iTunes file download with this edition of the movie!  The person I bought it for was particularly happy with this aspect of it!",1357344000,,283,4.127272727272727
4030881,2,B002ZG97M4,"No where near the original, and it gets confused throughout the movie - from playing modern hip hop in their cars and new country pop in the bar, to having a 1st gen ipod and everyone talking about cell phones but only showing the old rotary dial landlines of the 80's, to them breaking out a tape deck to play the 'music they aren't supposed to listen to'. In effect, I didn't know if it was a failed attempt at imitating the kitsch of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", or if they really were just too lazy to decide if it was the 80's or modern day. I suspect the former, but who knows...

The movie does have it's moments though...in all 10min of actual dancing, and in one line that came out right...

""Play fair, punk!"" made me laugh out loud, and the choreography at the end is great. The rest of the movie is better suited to entertain small children...that is, if you don't mind your kids looking up to a swearing, disrespectful ballerina.",1357257600,,934,4.393063583815029

4030943,4,B002ZG97M4,"After hearing what critics and others had to say, we didn't have high hopes for this movie. I think most of their dislike of the movie is that it isn't an exact remake. Rather it is the same story in a different location, with updated music, etc.
The relationship between Ren and Ariel is much more believable when played by Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough than in the orignial. While I found Kevin Bacon to be a believable and likable Ren, I always felt Lori Singer seemed far older than the teenager she was supposed to portray and was thus not believable in the role of Ariel.",1357257600,,580,4.429906542056075
4030944,4,B002ZG97M4,Being a fan of the original I think they did a pretty good job with the remake.  However I purchased this for my daughter who absolutely loves the movie.  She received it for Christmas and has already watched it 3+ times.,1357257600,,221,4.365853658536586
4030945,4,B002ZG97M4,"Granted, nothing will ever be as good as the original Footloose movie with Kevin Bacon.  That said, I thought the movie was entertaining and I love Julianne Hough.  Many people have given this movie a terrible wrap, but we all know that the reincarnation of a classic dance movie is a difficult proposition at best.

I think the film makers did a good job with the interpretation and development and I believe they cast the actors perfectly for their parts.

Overall, I would recommend this movie as an entertaining dance movie.  If every die hard original Footloose fan would take it for what it is and not continually contrast this with the original movie, I believe it is an enjoyable movie with a good cast.",1357257600,,711,4.656
4030946,1,B002ZG97M4,Horrible!  If you loved the original like I did back in the 80's this will be like hearing your favorite songs put to elevator music.

4030950,4,B002ZG97M4,It seems like a lot of films from my childhood are being remade these days and Footloose is just another in a long line of them.  I was bored one night and there was nothing else on TV so I gave it shot.  All in all it was an entertaining film.  I thought the beginning started off a little slow but after about 15 minutes it picked up and kept my attention though out the duration.  The film makers did change a few of the more iconic scenes (like playing chicken on tractors) but overall the story was the same.  If you have never seen it or if you aren't to uptight about a few changes to the story then I say give it a shot.,1356825600,,628,3.9523809523809526

4030952,2,B002ZG97M4,"Not sure what the point of this remake was. We only watched it because some of it was filmed in my partner's home town. Dennis Quaid was not at all convincing as a Southern Minister. Much of the movie was similar to the original (again, what was the point of making a remake?) Where there were differences, some of them were insignificant and others were just plain stupid: the game of chicken on the tractors in the original was replaced by a school bus race that turned into a smash up derby.

4031108,4,B002ZG97M4,"Having seen the first one years ago I was not sure what to expect out of this one.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The acting, while not top notch, was fairly decent.  The plot was similar to the original, but enough was changed so I did not feel like I was watching the same movie.  The dancing was fun to watch and had me smiling at parts.  I must admit I even watched the ending scene twice.  In my opinion, the best character in the movie was Willard.  He made me laugh because he represents every person who is shy of dancing.  Overall it is worth watching.  Don't listen to all the people who hate it because it is a remake, some people will never be happy with a movie they feel trounces on the hallowed ground of a favorite movie of their youth.  Watch it, enjoy it and you might find yourself dancing after you finish it.",1356048000,,828,4.2165605095541405

While the two movies have a lot in common, even some of the same music, its the differences that make this WELL worth the effort.  Seeing the original accident which led to the passing of the anti-dancing laws (which you also see being voted on), tells you very quickly that this is not a cookie-cutter remake.  The leads are both attractive, with good chemistry and a tallented cast of supporting actors make this a remake worth the time it takes you to watch it.  ENJOY!

4031245,1,B002ZG97M4,"I suppose the fact that I was a teenager when the original came out ruined any chance for this one to be considered good.  The music was painful to ones ears which is a shame since there were some pretty decent artists involved. What has happened to acting? This was abysmal. Ariel was not believable in the least bit as the slutty preachers kid.  Ren was inept at dancing, acting, emotion etc. His less than emotion filled speech to the city council was pathetic to say the least. Dennis Quaid failed miserably as Shaw.  John Lithgow was an imposing man as Shaw while being soft spoken. I won't even start in on Rusty and Willard. Changing the story line in some places to update it only served to further ruin the film. School bus races? Really? Why change it from playing chicken with tractors? That scene was so pathetically boring I was forced to fast forward through for any hope of finishing this film.  Truncating multiple scenes into one to well I suppose shorten the time frame leaves the viewer wondering what the hell the director was thinking.  Having Ariel confess her sins in church in front of Shaw should have been full of fire not ""oh by the way i'm not even a virgin"".  I fast forwarded through several parts of the movie just to get past the horrific acting and suddenly feel the need to watch the original to try and erase this one from my mind. Hollywood needs to stop remaking films and come up with some decent new ideas.",1355529600,7,1445,4.475285171102661

And boy did they butcher the original in every way possible. I had to immediately watch the original after seeing this version just to get it out of my head. Don't bother with this remake - just watch the original. And if you happen to have seen this and thought it was bad, please watch the original. It truly is a classic.  Come on Hollywood - is their anything original in there anymore? Yikes.",1355097600,19,559,4.314285714285714
4031248,4,B002ZG97M4,"When I found out they were re-making this movie, I (1) felt really old, and (2) shuttered at the thought of Hollywood desecrating and disrespecting this classic. (I saw it 6 Fridays in a row in the theaters) Also, who of us in the 80's didn't have a little Ren McCormick in us? So, needless to say, I thought that if I ever got around to watching this, I was probably not going to make it through the first 20 minutes. Boy was I wrong. Julianne Hough, is a perfect P.K. (preacher's kid) and..uh...what's his name is really likable against my every wishes of this project ever being  sought out. Over half of the movie is shot for shot, word for word re-make of the original. So you ask yourself, ""why re-make it then?"" To introduce it to a new audience. I'd like to call this ""Footloose 2.0"". Not a re-make, but an update. The charm, the music, the passion...it's all there.

Ariel is self centered and uninteresting.  Chuck is barely even a rival, and Ren is impossible to empathize with as he comes off as disrespectful and unnecessarily cocky, like a lot of kids nowadays.  This movie is like watching a poorly directed bubble gum commercial, and would actually make a great example of what not to do in a movie, as though they've basically stuck with the original storyline, the scenes utterly lack the poignant moments and emotions of the first one, and the dialogue just tries to explain the story so much that it is terribly unrealistic, unlike the first one.  It's a good indication of what ridiculous taste this country has now, as it really seems to have no heart and soul like the first one did.

This has been one of the disturbing trends to movies/shows being ""remakes"" of the originals... hard to improve a good movie / story line in the first place. Not really sure why they bothered. Replaced a cassette tape player with an iPod, the tractor ""chicken"" scene with a bus race, but pretty much the same movie.

Other than some ""modernization"" it's the same movie... good, but doesn't warrant more than 3 stars, the original deserves 5, watch both of them, you can hardly tell them apart... Can't give more stars for a ""copy"" of a good movie. Sorry.",1353801600,,838,4.58

Being a guy, I'll grant that the chick was way hotter than Lori Singer was. Not being a girl, I can't speak to what women think about this guy as opposed to Kevin Bacon.
The one aspect of this movie that I really liked was that these people can actually dance. TO THE MUSIC.
We see these BS shows like Dancing with the Stars, with has-been TV personalities of yesteryear trying to ballroom dance. Does anyone else not notice that ballroom dancing is more of an exhibition than a dance? These people do not dance to the music, they just perform a practiced exercise to some background music.
Real dancing, solo or partnered, should move to the particular song being played. Just as no two songs are the same, so no two dances should be.
Dirty Dancing was a corney movie but it did show the world what real partnered dancing should be. When Pat and Jen danced they at least danced TO the music. Bodies moving to the beat and rythm of the song. Hips moving to the timing of the drum.",1353110400,3,1210,4.40625

The acting by the lead guy wasn't as good as Kevin Bacon was in the original, but then again Kevin Bacon became a big star and I can't remember the name of the guy in this.  Although I did hear that his main career is actually dancing, not acting.  He is an amazing dancer and its worth watching this for that.  However, the movie wasn't exciting enough to keep it afloat beyond the dancing.  I don't know how many towns ban dancing in America in this day and age.  It may seem outlandish for some to fathom while watching this.  Clearly you'd need to keep the suspension of disbelief.  Dennis Quaid is fantastic as the dad of one of the teen girls and seems to be the only cast member who is a gifted actor.  His wife is played by Andie MacDowell in a pointless role proving that in Hollywood once you reach a certain age you have to take these little thankless Mother roles just to keep working.

4031756,5,B002ZG97M4,"No film I've seen so far in 2012 -- neither in a movie theater, nor on DVD -- has proven to be a BIGGER and BETTER surprise for me that 2011's ""Footloose"" ... a terrific (and terrifically-entertaining) remake of one of my LEAST favorite movies of the 1980s (one of many that came out back then where the film's soundtrack evidently had been written longgggg before anyone gave ANY thought whatsoever to constructing an even remotely-plausible movie plot that very same much-ballyhooed soundtrack might sorta-kinda ""fit into"", and/or a plot that otherwise resonated with even a modicum of genuine emotion).

What co-writer/director Craig Brewer (""Hustle & Flow"", ""Black Snake Moan"") has done here is basically re-invent/re-think the original ""Footloose"" from the ground, up -- providing, among many other things, a very understandable, plausible and empathetic reason now why the father-preacher character in ""Footloose"" (John Lithgow in the original; a much-better Dennis Quaid in the remake) does what he does.

In the original, Lithgow's character came across as a verrry thinly-veiled, self-serving loon ... someone who was simply ""deranged"" because he A) Believes in God, and B) Has banned dancing, live music, etc, throughout the small town where the ""Footloose"" characters live.

Conversely, in this 2011 version, we know almost immediately what has happened to both this town in general, and to Quaid's character in particular -- boy, do we EVER!! -- so pretty much EVERYTHING that follows that admittedly-horrific event does, for the most part, make sense (psychologically, emotionally, politically, etc).

Add to that the fact that the main couple in the movie (Lori Singer and Kevin Bacon in the original; Julianne Hough and Kenny Wormald in the remake) are now a MUCH more compelling, interesting, well-developed and well-rounded couple than they ever were in the mostly-forgettable 1980s version.

Hough and Wormald are also, arguably, CONSIDERABLY BETTER dancers, too (than either Bacon or Singer were), having won much-deserved accolades on numerous appearances of ""Dancing With the Stars"" over a five-year period -- among other very impressive professional-dancing credentials.

Plus, the music arrangements the filmmakers have done here with the songs from the original's soundtrack are nothing short of astonishing -- with special kudos to 15-year-old, North Carolina native ELLA MAE BOWEN (whose hauntingly-beautiful and wonderfully-quiet rendition of ""We Need a Hero Now"" is a real improvement in many ways, I think, over the obnoxiously-loud/pulsing Bonnie Tyler version that was featured in the first ""Footloose"").

(Bowen has a number of superb musical performances on YouTube that you may want to look up asap).

Faith-based and character-driven movies -- and 2011's ""Footloose"" is NOTHING if not THAT -- may not have had any place in mainstream Hollywood productions back in the 1980s, but thankfully they seem to have one now. And this constantly-surprising remake is proof-positive that you actually CAN have a father character in a film who genuinely DOES care about his daughter and who isn't merely an unceasingly-cartoonish/bufoonish, Bible-thumping caricature of one.

""Footloose"" (2011) is  movie with a lot of heart, soul, and wisdom in it. Didn't surprise AT ALL when I learned the other day (from the DVD's director's commentary) that co-writer/director Craig Brewer has two children of his own.

I watched it once by myself and once with my mother and both times we were laughing just about every time he went on screen.  They pretty much kept to the same script though there were differences.  I know the game of chicken was changed up quite a bit.  I guess kids nowadays are harder to entertain.  The juke joint scene was great.

4031918,3,B002ZG97M4,"Craig Brewer (""Hustle & Flow"", ""Black Snake Moan"") would seem to be an unlikely choice for directing this update of the 1984 minor classic of the same name.  Replacing Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer as the teenage leads are dancers Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough.  While neither is quite ready for the Oscar walk, they hold their own on the acting thing and are more than qualified in the dancing department.

The cornball story line has to do with the aftermath of a tragic car accident which killed 5 of small town Bomont, Georgia's teenagers.  Returning from a dance, the driver lost control and hit a semi-truck head on.  As a result, the town's (pop. 19,000) preacher (and father of the driver) leads the city council to set curfews for teens and outlaws loud music and dancing.  Ren (Wormald) moves to Bomont from Boston after his mother dies to live with his uncle and his family.  Ren discovers Ariel (Hough) who is the sister of the ill-fated driver and daughter of the Rev. (Dennis Quaid).  She's gone from nice girl to naughty girl after her brother's death, but mom and dad don't recognize her own pain.  Ren, of course does.  And when they discover they can both dance pretty well, they decide to try to overturn the arcane laws put in place.

Brewer and his choreographers do a good job of mixing up the dancing routines which range from country line dancing to acrobatic breaking, locking and popping.  All good although I thought Hough's abilities were restrained.  Her dance time was mostly sexy accompanying to Wormald's leads.  There's nothing really special about this movie, but I admit my toes were tappin' throughout.

The 1080p Blu ray disc has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is near perfect in every regard.  Beautiful sharp, clear photography transfers with no faults that I could see.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack is equally excellent.  Give Paramount credit on this one.",1337817600,2,1893,4.772307692307693

4032087,2,B002ZG97M4,"While I'm not opposed to remakes of teen classics, this one misses on several key marks, most notably a lack of acting chops in the main teen characters. The two leads come off as flat and are easily outshone by the supporting teen and adult actors (both very good). The main fault for this lies with the director, who seemed to be more concerned with the music selection (also good) than the acting or flow of the movie. Read one of his clunky interviews and you can see how he produces such a clunky movie.

Although I support the idea of casting ""unknowns"", I think Zac Efron would have done much better in the role. Both leads look more like 30 year olds than teens, which is further emphasized by the more youthful supporting actors. What's more, the heroes are made slutty and mean and the ""bad guys"" are more sympathetic, creating a big ole mess for the audience. Partying, drinking and sex seem to be more of a daily lifestyle choice for these teens, rather than an occasional way to blow off steam. Perhaps this reflects the reality of today's culture, but it undermines the theme of the movie.

The whole bit plays like the mocked up set piece that it is. You half expect to see 2x4s holding up the back of the buildings and I'd really like to know where in Georgia they grow enough cotton to operate a cotton gin for anything more than historical purposes. Gone is the fire and brimstone father of the original movie and in his place a benevolent but misguided Dennis Quaid with a Victoria's Secret model for a daughter. Black Americans are patronizingly presented as the friendly natives in much the same way they were in Mel Gibson's defeatist The Patriot.

I have not seen the original (avoid the Bacon at all costs) yet somehow this remake wound up on my Netflix queue and before I could stop it, they were shipping it to my house.  My wife was excited.  She loves dancing.  I do too, but there was something about this that seemed so `wrong' to me; so much so that I was heavily opposed to us watching it.

We watched it.

There is so much wrong with `Footloose' that I'm not even sure where to begin.  The basic premise is that a town, stricken with tragedy, goes overboard in an attempt to preserve the lives of their youth and actually bans public dancing unless supervised and orchestrated by adults (like a school dance observed by the Minister who enforces a rule that forbids dancing closer than six inches apart).  The Minister's young and tramplike daughter rebels, dates an older guy and dances in the parking lot of a local diner when the police aren't patrolling.  An outsider with a heart of gold comes to town, is picked on by locals, given a bad wrap and eventually falls for the Minister's daughter and together they fight for their right to dance.

Seriously.

The fact that nothing in `Footloose' makes sense ultimately becomes the film's biggest downfall.  I mean, it's enough that the town bans dancing, which is somewhat ludicrous, but the way the dance scenes are staged are ridiculous (the music blaring at a popular diner in a small town and thought to be unnoticeable when a cop literally pulled out of the parking lot not thirty seconds before the owner popped in the CD) and the music selected, while paying homage to the original film, also made no sense.  I'm sorry, but the song `Footloose' just isn't cool anymore, no matter who is singing it.  The acting is horrendous and the plotting is filled to the brim with holes that are puttied over with obvious clichs.

Yes, Dennis Quaid sells his speeches, but outside of that the film is a bit `WTF'.

I also found it quite humorous that Andie MacDowell gives some ""I've been silent"" speech towards the end and I was thinking to myself, `I totally forgot you were in this'...i.e.; she was right.  Kenny Wormald can't act, but he can dance; although I must say that this film tries far too hard to emulate the latest trend in `Step Up' films and fails rather drastically because the integration of country music into this breed of film doesn't come off as `inspired' as they wanted it to.  The dancing numbers become repetitive and lack any real charisma (all fake, plastic, manufactured).  Mile Teller is kind of hilarious and deserves props for having to spit out some of the most ridiculously clichd and stereotypical jargon I've heard in a feature film lately.  After watching him devastate in 2010's `Rabbit Hole', I was hoping he'd get a big break.  Maybe this was it.  Maybe now he can move on to more fare similar to `Rabbit Hole'.

Oh, and Wormald's dance freakout in the mill is completely OTT and utterly hilarious; which was not the intent.",1334275200,7,3014,4.592523364485982

4032272,1,B002ZG97M4,"First off,  I have a couple disclaimers just to clear things up.
Number One--I grew up in the eighties and Footloose was one of my favorite movies it was right up there with Breakfast Club and Top Gun. But also realize I enjoyed motion pictures like Children of a Lesser God as well. With that said, I tried to go in to this movie with an open mind and unbiased in anyway, whether or not I was successful read on and decide for yourself.
Number Two--I am by no means an accomplished critic in anyway,  it's very hard for me to find a movie I don't take joy in watching. After all, I am a movie geek, love movies, and watch everything I can get my hands on from raucous comedies to critically acclaimed to foreign films, and even some anime and an emerging new genre like FFVII: Advent Children and others in this type of film medium. I do have a minor in film studies from Wichita State University, but these are my only credentials. With these things said, read further if you would like to know my opinion of the Footloose remake.

In the ""It's our Time"" Footloose remake, it is far from its time because the hits are far outnumbered by the misses. I wish I could start and end on positive notes, there just wasn't much positive in this movie. I will cover the short list of hits in the movie first. If casting on looks alone were the only criteria for a good movie remake then this is a perfect movie all of the main characters seem to mimic the looks of the original cast; except for the changing of nationality of some of the characters, and Dennis Quaid doesn't resemble John Lithgow in any way.
I like the rewrites of the script where it concerns Ren's, aunt's husband. This was a nice attempt and a good hit. And the actor portraying him I believe gave one of the best, if not the best performance in the movie. I also like the reason Ren came to Bomont to live with his aunt, though it's true motives and potential falls way short, oh sorry, this is supposed to be the positives. The beginning and it's connecting parts throughout the film did its job in explaining the town a little, but not by much. The dance scenes were okay for the most part although most reminded me of the original more than being original themselves. Let's see, anything else...The actor playing Willard made me think of Sean Penn the whole time, nonetheless he did okay in his performance, as good as any of the other's except of course for the aunt's husband. Beyond these few things, there wasn't much else good about the movie.
And now for the misses, but there are so many, I do not know where to begin, so I will try and stick to fim criteria such as music, acting, script, and the like. First off, and I know this is my bias, the remakes of two of the more important songs in the movie were done horribly, not to mention leaving off the song from Ren's dance scene in the saw mill in the original; or if they used the same song it was done so horribly I didn't recognize it. Remaking a rock song into a ballad was the worst travasity I think. I could see changing it to a ballad if it was an emotional scene but it wasn't or if it was supposed to be, it fell short by far. And the remake of the love ballad at the end, it was so bad that I took the time to run to the restroom while it was playing. But I do apologize for being so harsh because I know music is subjective.
As for the acting and performances, as I said the only really memorable role was that of the aunt's husband. I saw very little chemistry between the Ren and Arielle character, but the friendship between Willard and Ren was done better I think, but this was by no means The actor who played Ren's doing, it was the actor playing Willard. Again Andie McDowell's role as Val Moore was given very little screen time at all, and this was probably the director's fault, I think Val should play a bigger role in the film. I say this mainly because one of the reason's I wanted to see it was because Dennis Quaid was cast as the Reverend. And I was very disappointed in his performance, in fact, it was subpar for any actor with his experience, but again this may not have been Mr. Quaid's fault. And it is hard to follow a performance like John Lithgow's was in the original film. Is there anything else about the acting??? Nothing that stands out.
The script...the main script was pretty much identical to the original, almost. The script tempted to add a few things and those things for the most part would have been excellent if they had been done properly. As I said in the positive's the relationship between Ren and his aunt's husband was a little better developed and I like the idea of him supporting instead of not as he did in the first one. I like the added dimension of why Ren ended up in Bomont, but it really was followed through haphazardly. Yes there was a lot of mention of it, but the actor portraying Ren didn't convey that much except for in the dance sequence in the abandoned building. The father-daughter relationship between Arielle and the reverend was done so much better in the original, and only one of the changes was a near hit, but ultimately failed because it lacked the emotion of the original. As I mentioned before Willard's and Ren's friendship was done better as well. I could pick this near exact cover of the script to death so I won't. I will just mention that the catch phrase for the movie and all over the poster's, `It's our Time', could have given this movie much more praise and power, but we never really see anything about it until the last few scenes of the movie. So don't let the phrase seduce you into watching the movie, because I believe you will be sorely disappointed. I would wait until it reaches DVD to watch it, but probably not even then. I was going to add it to my amazon wish list as soon as it was available. But now I don't think I will, and I feel it may well end up on the shelf way sooner than MTV wants it too.
In closing, if I as a freelance writer were commissioned to do another remake of the motion picture Footloose, I would probably piece together the best parts of both scripts and focus a little more on the relationships of the characters and keep the original music the way it was. Then look to the stars in the midnight sky and hope I could find actors and actresses that could convey the best  performances of the two motion pictures combined...Kevin Bacon, John Lithgow, Lori Singer, Andie McDowell, and those actors playing Willard and the aunt's husband in the remake...and there could be the potential to leave a lasting impression like August Rush, Music & Lyrics, Save the Last Dance, and Top Gun.
Well I hope this helps those who were wavering on whether or not to go see the movie in their decision-making. For those who loved the movie, I am sorry if I offended you, but if you really look within and maybe even compare the old and new songs one after the other, then you may begin to understand why I only gave this remake one star.  Until my next review, do yourself a favor and go take in a motion picture this weekend and suspend your disbelief for a couple hours, it may change the world, but if not the world; at the very least, it may change you just a little bit.",1333584000,4,7220,4.313696612665685

4032274,5,B002ZG97M4,"I just skimmed the one-star reviews decrying the messing with of a classic. When I rented this I was skeptical and thought I was going to be among that group as I was just a very young - under 21 - adult for the first go-around.  I've seen what Hollywood can do to a classic TV show like Dukes of Hazzard and also The Brady Bunch and some remakes of other movies have been less than decent.  So I was not about to plunk down my hard-earned at Walmart money to see basically a ""High School Musical"" or ""Glee"" dumb-down of this in the theater.
  I have to say that I was impressed at the faithfulness this rework exercised - like a great cover of a favorite song.  While the time-frame of the story is set in the present time, it's the same.  I like how they revisit some of the original music of the 1984 but give it a new twist.  The acoustic rendition of ""Holding Out For A Hero"" was superb.  Also I like a few of the changes for some of the scenes such as the racing of the school buses in place of the chicken game with the farm tractors, the dance at the drive-in instead of the hamburger joint and the dance lesson scenes for the cowboy kid were adorable. Making changes like these does not diminish the movie in anyway, there is not need to make a carbon copy, no more than Whitney trying to make a country version of ""I Will Always Love You"", her rendition captures the spirit of that song.
  While the original movie is still and always will be my classic, there are some elements that give this version an advantage over the original:

The Opening: The tragic car wreck and what led up to it and the subsequent laws that were passed as a result.  Here we see that the laws being passed in the wake of the tragedy came from love and genuine concern for the well-being of the adolescents from a heart-broken community.

The Court Scene: The concern stemming from the heartbreak from the loss is once again communicated by the preacher  when Ren wants to appeal against the no-dancing law.  The original movie paints the adults as oppressive and uncaring toward the youth because you don't see that love and concern that spawned the law, also the committee are rather condescending with Ren in the original.  In this remake, the preacher sounds empathetic and sensitive to what Ren is asking for.  Overall, the court scene in the remake is rendered much better in my opinion.

Preacher/Daughter Showdown Scene:  Here we see that the daughter is not merely being a rebel, she - like her mother - are frustrated by him, that because of losing his son he is over doing it in trying to protect her to the point that he is basically smothering her.

Preacher and Ren Scene:  Finally Ren's asking the preacher if he can take his daughter to the dance that was going to happen anyway in the neighboring town since Bomont was to remain a no-dance town. Here we see the preacher and the person he considers his enemy beginning to see eye to eye.

I like how this movie - though depicting the typical ""teenage rebellion"" and showing drinking of alcohol and explicit dancing, I feel it's conveys the message that it isn't espousing such behavior but showing how it can lead to bad consequences - the accident - and that while adolescents may want to ""act stupid"" as Ren said in the courtroom, there is a way to do it without harming yourself.  The movie also - like the original - espouses that parents and adults concerned about adolescents have to find that balance where you can set boundaries to protect them but not so much you are stiffing them and even giving them a reason to fight against you.

Congratulations on a job well done.",1333324800,3,3634,4.421921921921922

In 2011 Craig Brewer took over and rereleased (or perhaps I should say updated) the idea for the 21st century. Kenny Warmald stars as the new kid, Ren, and Jullianne Hough as his love interest. Dennise Quaid replaces John Lithgow as the firey Southern Baptist preacher determined to keep the town under his control.
Although the movie is meant for fun, it makes some good points. As Kenny's character says, there was a time for a ban on dancing and merry-making. But that time has ended. Teenagers need to be young and to live it up while they can. Ren at one point tries to convince town council of this by reading Bible verses. Psalms. Proverbs. Ephesians. I beleive it goes something like, ""Sing unto the LORD a new song"" and dancing ties in with it. How ironic that a preacher would outlaw dancing when the Word encourages it! Hmmm.
Altogether, the movie is a delight to watch and to relive the original. My own first exposure to Footloose was the classic Kenny Loggins song at my junior/senior prom. In October 2011 I went to the theater with my mom to see the movie and we both just loved it! The story reminded me of A Walk to Remember (another great film) and the classic story by Nicholas Sparks. Coming of age. Small towns. Pastor's daughter. A great love story.
That's what this movie is all about: a great story. And I advise everyone of you to go see it and buy it and cherish something that lives on no matter what the generation. Masterpieces speak no matter the generation. I have not seen the original yet (so sorry, mama!), but when I do, Amazon will have my review and my subsequent purchase.
Happy viewing!",1332979200,,1945,4.497175141242938

Normally I don't like remakes, but this one was pretty good.  I liked how it was updated to reflect the times, but it didn't change so much that it was totally unrecognizable.

I understand it is intended for the youth of today, however, aside from some variation in music, most songs from the 1984 movie turned into country-western sound, the script sticks very close to the original.  It seems to me that dusting off the older movie is a much more enticing movie for viewers of all ages.",1332547200,,368,4.6461538461538465

4032452,2,B002ZG97M4,"I guess this is what progress is, no more character, no more talent. If they're going to destroy movies like Footloose, why don't they just make their own movie and call it something else. I remember a time not too long ago when they remade songs and movies and many times they were better than the original, not anymore.
  Every part of this movie was mediocre at best, including the music, acting, dialogue, filming, directing and producing. This is a good example of what happens when you let your children grow up with no guidance, let them be who they are and try not to influence them as they grow up. We now live in a time where the young have no talent and no character, they are just a bunch of sheep with no common sense. They really should have have thrown in a few gays and lesbians so it could have totally fit the cookie cutter mold.
  This movie is just another movie that I would call ""Fill"", Something that's there to fill in the gaps between the good movies, which are few and far between these days.",1332374400,3,1018,4.342105263157895

4032454,4,B002ZG97M4,"I have to admit: I'm much too young to have seen the original FOOTLOOSE. With that being said, I still think if a remake succeeds it should be able to be good on its own merits. Especially in this case, because, like me, a majority of the audience probably aren't familiar with the original.

As far as the actual plot goes, I was impressed! The main character had an intriguing story and was an immensely likable character. The love story was so much more organic than 99 perent of modern romance movies. I also was impressed at how well this film dealt with issues like domestic abuse, the effects of over parenting and the negative effects of over-the-top Christian fundamentalism. Oh, yeah, the dancin' ain't too bad either.",1332201600,3,728,4.6875
4032455,5,B002ZG97M4,"They remade Footloose?  I groaned when I even thought about how bad this was going to be.  I liked the original, and didn't even consider seeing this when it came out at the theatre.  Flash forward to a cold and rainy night, and my teenage kids decide to rent this on pay per view.  I groan again, thinking how awful this is going to be.  I couldn't even watch it, so I puttered around the house doing everything else but sit there and watch a somewhat iconic movie be destroyed.  Two hours later, and my kids could not stop talking about it.  They loved it.  Curious, I plopped down and watched it.  They wanted to see it again.  I was shocked.  The first thing that grabs your attention is how my kids kept thinking the clothes and hair were cool.  I told them that in the ancient 80's, we used to flip our collars up, have our pants cinched at the ankles, and wear our hair short on the sides and long on top.  I also told them we used to dance.  It was a blast from the past, but a bridge to the present.  The story seemed fresh to the teenagers, and was even fresh to me.  The dancing is great.  The acting is decent, and this movie is fun.  There are a few scenes that are not appropriate for younger kids (a girl having sex for the first time, drug references, underage drinking, a girl getting slapped by her boyfriend, some swearing), but very tame stuff when compared to the groundbreaking stuff John Hughes did in the 80's.  It was a way to connect with the kids.  The movie is certainly way better than expected.  Way better than the garbage some remakes are.  Well done.  Well done indeed.",1332115200,59,1602,4.266666666666667
4032456,2,B002ZG97M4,"I want to be clear the only reason this film is getting 2 stars is because I like the remake of some of the songs and willard danced better in this remake.

I have never bothered to review a film before, but I felt after watching this film it was my duty to warn people.  the bad acting random lines from old movie, the dance off at a drive in movie theater were all the girls danced like they were swinging on poles ohh wait they did swing on poles.  This movie could have been so much better, the 15 people that gave it 5 stars must have been all men and had the film on mute.

Acting was naturalistic and not overly pop Hollywood. Overall just nicely scripted. Suggest seeing the original first then this redux update.,1331942400,,305,5.51063829787234
4032458,3,B002ZG97M4,"Well, for the most parts the movie was a remake of the first...same language, same hits, same songs.  There were a couple things that lost the movie for me....the scene in the warehouse with Wren dancing...the first one he was angry, but never vandalised anything.  He didn't have to here.

As for the quality of the HD.  I have a great TV and downloaded this through Amazon HD, the movie was by no means HD.  If was hard to view, especially during anytime that there was a lot of motion....during a dance movie, that is a lot of the time.  It became almost pixalated, little blocks of pictures.  It never tracked to clear itself up but the viewing quality was more like ONE star.

I am hoping that they did NOT butcher the original just to make a quick buck. Footloose is almost, not quite but almost, on a level with Grease NOT Grease 2 btw. However, the original Footloose had soooo much dancing, great moves, self expression, and GREAT songs that all ages could enjoy. I am curious to see the remake, HOWEVER, if the preview is actually how the movie will be...I will give a bad review...a very bad review. So if you're like me and loved the freedom of expression and originality that the original footloose brought...watch the preview because I'mma wait a bit. So keep your eyes pealed for my updated review AFTER I watch and hope for the best =)

Update: All in all, very similar to the original. It is good for a one time watch and the songs have been re-made. If you really LOVED the original, you probably won't like this. Again, very similar to the original. I would say it's an updated original that you can watch with your kids and they will better relate to the characters.",1331683200,,1109,4.409756097560976

I liked that they didn't add too many new dance styles with people just constantly break dancing all over like most new dance movies these days. I do wish they would have kept it back in that time era though, i find it hard to believe a town would pass a no dance law in 2011.

Ren (Kenny Wormald) has to move to Georgia after his mother passes away to live with his uncle and their family. There he meets Ariel (Julianne Hough) who is the wild preacher's daughter and a fire slowly builds between the two as they learn more about each other and their love of dancing.

The storyline is pretty true to the original movie but there are a few changes. I won't spoil them for you as you have to watch the movie. My wife and I both liked the remake and the acting was above average. Julianne Hough does a wonderful job as the preacher's daughter and the dance scenes are a lot of fun to watch. Almost all the characters are still in the remake and you will enjoy the goofy county boy Willard (Miles Teller) who steals the dance scene near the end of the movie.

4032548,5,B002ZG97M4,"I dragged two friends to see Footloose with Kevin Bacon when it premiered in Seattle.  They didn't care very much for the film.  I, on the other hand, loved it.  I had never heard of Kevin Bacon, but I became and instant fan.  I have watched everything he has done, right down to the episodes of The Closer that he directed.

I own 6 DVDs of Hamlet.  Should I say that since Laurence Olivier filmed Hamlet there is now no room for anyone else to do so?  Are David Tennant, Derek Jacobi and Christopher Plummer to be seen as ""upstart crows"" who have nothing new to add?  I mean, Olivier!  How do you top that?  Or could we see Tennant and Jacobi and Plummer as actors with a different interpretation?

And, could we not look at the remake of Footloose as a different interpretation rather than seeing it as a replacement?  I loved Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer.  But, I was a Kenny Warmold fan from the moment I saw him in Center Stage: Step It Up.  As Ren MacCormack he shines, for me, as innocence and determination combined.  And Julianne Hough -- what a revelation !!  I mean, we knew she could dance.  But, as an actress, she blew me away !!!  And what a find in Miles Teller.  He was hip, cool, and funny all at the same time.

I don't see this rendition of Footloose as a would-be replacement of the original.  I see it as a new interpretation of a story that will never grow old.  And, as such, I welcome it, I embrace it, and I commend it.

Two great versions of the same story!!  Who could ask for anything more?",1331337600,11,1519,4.230769230769231

I didn't like the way the characters were portrayed by Kenny Wormaid as Ren, or Julianne Hough as Ariel, or even Dennis Quaid as the preacher dad. Miles Teller as Willard was great.

Different sountrack from the original, Ren's Mom is gone, Ren's from some other city (not Chicago), his friend Willard is very hard to understand.  Dennis Quaid as Ariel's father seemed stiff in this, it just wasn't moving fluidly along. Ariel's boyfriend looked about 30 yrs. old. When playing ""chicken"" they used a school bus?  LOL.  Beaumont is now Bomont?
  Rap garbage music infiltrated this movie, not the place for it, along with line dancing to rap music? Odd.  Some movies just should be left alone as originals. Where'd most of the original music go?  They replaced it, ugh!  Go with the 1984 version.  The soundtrack rocked and so did the acting, dancing and the movie!  I'm sure those that are 30 yrs. and younger will like this movie.  I'm early 40's and have better taste than this. I thought I'd give it a shot.  Hey they remade True Grit and it wasn't a flop so I've heard.  Footloose- It's ok to pass a couple of hours, but not a keeper.",1331164800,2,995,4.611428571428571

I had to restrain myself from fastforwarding this within the first 15mins and I kept hoping it would get better ... it didn't. It may be worth $1 for the rental for some, but man am I glad I actually got this rental for free because personally - I'd want my $1 back. As it is I already want my 1hr 50mins minutes back. It was so obvious it was an Mtv production - this should've aired on Mtv or gone straight to DVD. And the ""actors"" in it should go back to their dancing day jobs.

The only reason this movie ever made it into the theaters is because it was a remake of a cult classic. A lame, insulting remake at that. The dancing in the original may have not been as cool cuz it was 80's style, but at least they were great actors and the soundtrack was good too.",1331078400,2,984,4.2063492063492065

4032636,3,B002ZG97M4,"Yeah, I know; I was thinking it too: ""A Footloose remake? Why?"" If there was any saving grace to the idea, it was that the film was to be helmed by the man who brought us Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan, two movies steeped in the music and culture of the American South. As it turns out, much to the surprise of moviegoers who initially balked at the remake, Craig Brewer's updated Footloose isn't half bad. Following cues from the original film relatively closely -- with a few tweaks -- the story revolves around a big city high schooler who moves to a small, conservative Southern town where, due to a past teenage tragedy, loud music and public dancing have been outlawed. Throw in a star-crossed romance with the local reverend's rebellious daughter, and you're looking at a pretty faithful remake. I felt that Brewer did a respectable job both paying homage to the original film and updating the story for a new generation, infusing Footloose with the same kind of energy he harnessed for his previous films.

Now let's see if this sweet-spirited version (which duplicates many of the original scenes verbatim!) will do the same for our new Ren McCormack. Based on the DVD available from Amazon, I think it might.

  * Kenny Wormald (""Center Stage: Turn It Up"") is Ren, who, after his mother died, was transplanted from Boston to this podunk town out in the hinterlands of Texas, where his love of dancing hits a stone wall. Wormald is a former backup dancer for Justin Timberlake, who recommended him for this role. Good call, Justin!
  * Dennis Quaid (""Vantage Point"") is Reverend Moore, the grieving minister who had a town ordinance passed that outlawed dancing three years ago after five teenagers were killed, including his boy.
  * Julianne Hough (""Dancing With the Stars"") is Ariel, the minister's daughter, rebellious and in pain because her father's sole focus is on his dead son and not on his living daughter.
  * Andie MacDowell (""Groundhog Day"") is Vi, the minister's wife. Her job is to referee the battles between her husband and their daughter and to provide another point of view when it's needed ...which is fairly often.
  * Ray McKinnon (""The Blind Side"") surprised me as Ren's Uncle Wes, because this gawky hick turned out to be fair, supportive and wise. I'm always shocked when I have to revise my expectations of a character that are based on a few prejudices of my own.
  * Miles Teller is a revelation! That sad, bewildered teenager from ""Rabbit Hole"" is the guy Ren and his nieces teach to dance. He's funny and (eventually) he really dances in a highly entertaining montage; I always like to watch someone master a new skill.

Of course you have the usual coterie of chums and high-school faculty, plus members of that well-meaning town council, so there are many capable actors who get to strut their stuff. The line dancing is enjoyable, but the grudge race using school buses left me cold.

I'm glad the film starts with that horrific wreck, it's a great illustration of the hazards of drinking and driving! I appreciate the clean-shaven look of the principal players - only the bad guys are scruffy. This version, like the first, does NOT devolve into an anti-religious screed, but instead respects the convictions of the principals, e.g., Ren uses the Old Testament in his petition to the city council.

This film is PG-13, so you'll hear a smattering of profanity and see the promise of nudity, but not the real thing. No gunshots or blowie uppie stuff, but you DO see what a reckless wench Ariel has become. Don't hate me Kevin Bacon, but given the athleticism of today's dancers, I like this one better than yours.",1328486400,6,2741,4.751054852320675

I looked into it more and more on the internet and found out about it more. I found out that it was going to be country and not rock like the first one. it was going to be a little different but still have the same characters and the same plot. I saw previews and thought, why not give it a try since the main star, Kenny Wormald, looked pretty good in it. I took my eight year old son to it when it first came out to theaters and had a blast watching it. A couple weeks later, I took the whole family to it because I liked it so much. There are some remakes that they shouldn't touch but this one, was a good one because you cant really say remake to this...its just a country version of it.

i went in with a open mind that it is not 1984 anymore.but they left 1984 stuff in there.for starters,the volkswagon beetle.hello,it is 2011.you mean you could not throw a 1993 mustang in there a 1987 camero?

i was surprised they kept the quiet riot classic ""bang your head"" in the movie.but not the part you remember.wren gets pulled over after fixing the car up and taking it for a test drive.

music was not that great.mostly country.they killed the original soundtrack.they got ""holding out for a hero"" as a ballad.wtf?and it was not in the chicken race scene either.that was replaced by kids(wren racing chuck and his friends) with school buses.

one of my favorite scenes was the warehouse scene in the original.once again,another mess up.wren pulls into the warehouse and when he is having the flashbacks,he is arguing with himself.he is saying what he would say if he was face to face with them.plus that was the most dumbest dancing i have ever seen in my life.like he was just goofing off.

ariel boyfriend chuck was not as good as the original.honestly,you forget about him till he pops in.i think you seen him 3 times

i don't want to ruin the rest of the movie.but the thing that bothered me the most was they took parts and replaced them.wren's uncle is on wren's side of things.you notice parts are here instead of there.overall,the same lines.just not where you expect them.and the fight scene at the end was really lame.and the actors always had a happy face on thru the whole movie.kinda like ""look at me.i am on camera"" look.like they didn't take the movie serious enough.

here is my thing.if you don't want to stick close to the original,then fine.update it.new car,new lines,new music.but if all your going to do is cover songs,keep the same lines,same cars,and rearrange a few things,then just leave it alone

overall,a okay movie.i will say it had its moments and did a good job in sticking with the original.but if your like me,seen this movie millions of times(my dad wore the original out) and get bugged my misplaced things,then don't waste your time.",1323129600,3,2348,4.794554455445544
4032703,2,B002ZG97M4,"Not without its moments - actors Kenny Wormald (Ren) and Miles Teller (Willard) have good chemistry, especially their first meeting (which plays out like a ""meet cute"") - and there's some clever re-imagining of the classic songs, but overall too poorly motivated and too contrived to earn my ""but in"" to the movie.  I mean, Rusty is obviously into Ren when she sees him and she's a way better choice than Ariel as a girlfriend but then all of a sudden out of nowhere Rusty and Willard are together? Where did that come from? Just needed to get the good girlfriend out of the way so the hero ends up with the girl the script calls for without looking like a total idiot for passing up the good girlfriend?",1322697600,7,704,4.457364341085271
4032704,5,B002ZG97M4,"I watched the original when it first came out and loved it. I seen reviews and thought will or won't I and then I seen the trailer with the line dance and that sold it on me going to see it in the cinema. I found dennis quaid to be a much better preacher than the original - boy must be a born preacher cause he was good, couldn't believe that they could find someone so close looking to the original dancing dork that I thought they must be related. I like the red boots making a reappearance but could have done without the 80's prom dress - though it is back in style again (too bad - thought it might be a style forever forgotten). I like the way that they changed certain characters like the boyfriend being a racecar driver. For anyone who loved the original this is a much needed see - best remake of an iconic movie that I have seen...............",1321056000,,855,4.1878787878787875
4032705,2,B002ZG97M4,"When I saw the MTV Films Logo flash across the screen in the Theatre, I settled back, knowing I was in for a good film, since similar films MTV has produced in the past with similar themes, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Walk-to-Remember/dp/B001NW8D6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Walk to Remember</a>&nbsp;with Mandy Moore, have been fabulous - but I was wrong.

While this remake has much in common with the original 1984 production, it just isn't as well done.  I did not find the dancing scenes to be as compelling, for the most part, and there were quite a few scenes and themes inserted into this film that had no reason for being there, or which were clumsily handled.  The bus-demolition derby scene, in particular, has a bit where the lead character, Ren asks himself ""What have I gotten myself into?"" - and we're left wondering the same thing.

Even so, most of the acting was really well done.  The real scene stealer, as others have noted, is Miles Teller, who plays Ren's gawky, awkward pal, and we have wonderful performances from many of the other actors in this production, both young and old, particularly  Andie MacDowell (best known for appearing opposite Bill Murray in Groundhog Day), Dennis Quaid (as her husband, the preacher) and Ray McKinnon (as Ren's Uncle).

Yet, the producers of this film throw lots of stuff at you without thought for how to make sure it makes sense to the audience.  Each scene needs to build on what has come before, there needs to be coherence and some sort of natural flow from one scene to the next.  You do not want to leave the audience wondering ""why did he (or she) do that?""  So, despite the excellent acting, some good dance scenes, the production as a whole is poor due to poor directing and especially bad editing.  I'll give the film two stars - worth buying when you find it as ""closeout"", and OK to watch as a streaming rental on a night when you have nothing else to do, but not worth seeing in the Theatres, nor worth paying full price to own.",1320796800,2,2062,4.813031161473088
4032706,5,B002ZG97M4,"This movie is about a guy named Ren Mac Cormack (KennyWormald) who just moved into with his aunt, uncle and cousins in a  really small town called Bomont.  Ren meets Ariel Moore (Julianne Hough) who is the wild girl and reverend's daughter.  Bomont has a law that the residents of residents could not dance or listen to loud music because some seniors, including Reverend Moore's son (Dennis Quaid) and Ariel's brother was killed in an accident along with some other seniors in the class coming home from a dance.  After three years after the tragedy Ren and the other seniors want to have a dance to celebrate the end the year.  This movie is really good. I loved it so much!

4032707,5,B002ZG97M4,"As soon as I heard from a local Sheriff in Hiram, Ga that the Downtown Hiram Car lot and Downtown Hiram (Where the bus drove through and stopped) was filming the new Footloose (August 2010) I was all over it. I found all of the locations used, and even went into Cowboys Atlanta in Kennesaw, Ga when they were filming since I know the houseband and had connections. I was waiting since then for it to be in theaters. I have seen the original 1984 version thousand times, but I LOVE the new one as well. Not only is it personal to me, but I love when they actually do a great re-make. So if you have not seen it yet. Get off these reviews and see it BEFORE judging (since I know some people are TOO judgmental over it)",1320624000,19,717,4.128571428571429
