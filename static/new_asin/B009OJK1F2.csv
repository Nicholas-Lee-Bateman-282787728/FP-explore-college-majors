8543407,5,B009OJK1F2,As good as the stuff put out by Absinthe and Brain Farm - hellacious heli footage and a super solid soundtrack. Xavier de Le Rue's finale footage of Alaska lines is like nothing I've ever seen. His part alone warrants buying this vid.,1400630400,,234,4.465116279069767
8543408,4,B009OJK1F2,I was actually pretty surprised at how good this video actually was. They feature some great riders and the music is actually pretty good.,1379462400,,138,4.791666666666667
