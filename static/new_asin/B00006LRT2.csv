As it is, this album has them playing through a bunch of Bela Fleck songs in the studio, with only a few jams.  I suppose they needed context to make a DVD, but I really cannot stand the saxophone player in Bela Fleck, so I was a bit annoyed.  But still...these guys rock and the interviews are pretty fun.",1169078400,,410,4.1645569620253164
8190879,5,B00006LRT2,"A very inspiring video. Its more a documentary on the process of creating music in the studio than a jam or method on how to play. Wooten, Beauford (and other musicians) build tracks in the studio, interact and improvise. Both talk about the creative process and express themselves really well. We hear about their values, experiences (and most of all, hear their musicianship in action) as they build a recording. Its not often you get to hear artists talk about their work in such depth. True, some of the music is played over and over, but it allows you to focus on the subtle changes they are making to the songs. There is, of course, a lot here for drum or bass players. Additional material includes a master class by Wooten",1145145600,5,729,4.572519083969466
8190880,3,B00006LRT2,"Warning. This DVD could be a waste of your time, or maybe you'll like it...it truly depends on how long you can stand to watch Carter Beauford and Vic play together in the studio. I don't find Zenergy (one of their showcased songs) to be too great of a song in the first place...however, some of the improv stuff that these two guys do is entertaining. If you desire some Vic dialogue material, there are added features on the DVD where Vic talks a long time and even answers questions. In addition to dialogue in the bonus material, there is a video of his performance at Bass Day 2000. He performs an original song that he would later incorporate into the next Flecktones CD (Little Worlds). This product wasn't too beneficial for me, but if you're a die hard Victor Wooten fan, then you'll probably be satisfied with it.",1072310400,11,823,4.530201342281879
