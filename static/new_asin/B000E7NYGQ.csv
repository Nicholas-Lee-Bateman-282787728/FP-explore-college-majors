8106927,1,B000E7NYGQ,"This DVD attempts to cover way too much in too little time. Explaing 7 card stud, Caribbean stud, Texas Hold'em and Omaha in about 25 minutes. No strategy or technique at all. It is less than a beginner level DVD. Camera is often too far away to see the cards on the table. You can find any of the information from this DVD doing a quick internet search on the games AND a lot more. Definitely pass on this one, really disappointed when I got it.",1141430400,6,446,4.1976744186046515
