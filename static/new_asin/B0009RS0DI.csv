8065650,5,B0009RS0DI,"This movie is not the ""Ten Commandments""  it is ""The Commandment"".  And event though it was made years ago it still

carries a good message.  I'm so glad  I was able to buy this and that's because of Amazon and a seller that helps us buffs
learn about such movies.  It arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely.  There will be more purchases for me to make
and add to my collection.  Thank you to the seller and to Amazon.",1386288000,4,432,4.246913580246914
8065651,5,B0009RS0DI,"Marjorie Cooley is my mother. She is now eighty five years old and was thrilled when I gave her the DVD. I also bought several other films she was in from other sources. She was seventeen and under contract with Twentieth Century Fox when this was filmed. So of course, I think it is a marvelous film. I would be very pleased to purchase any others, if you can locate more.",1182816000,8,373,4.267605633802817
8065652,5,B0009RS0DI,Given what is happeneing right now in the middle east I can't think of a more important film for people to watch. It explains how the early israelites had to fight for their freedom 2000 years ago. It's the same soft of fighting that is going on today and it really made me rethink what I thought about what was going on. The film is also well preserved and has some great action sequences in it.,1153440000,,396,4.223684210526316
8065653,5,B0009RS0DI,"I'm  not usually a fan of religious films, but I thought that this one is much, much better than most. It's nowhere near as preachy as The Passion of the Christ and not a ridiculous spectacle like The Ten Comandments.

Instead it takes a general adventure theme and sets it in the time of Jesus. Of course the hero must choose between saving his own life and embracing the side of god and jesus.

You can probably guess what choice he makes, but the film is a fun ride from start to finish.

It's a good film if you want some religion in your film experience but don't want it shoved down your throat.",1146614400,2,601,4.245614035087719
8065654,5,B0009RS0DI,"""I don't know what I expected when I sat down to watch The Great Commandment, but I don't think I will forget what it taught me. I found the film moving and very inspiring, and will not hesitate to recommend it to everyone who wants to know what real values are all about. Kudos to A2ZCDS for releasing this wonderful gem of a movie.""",1146528000,2,334,4.234375
