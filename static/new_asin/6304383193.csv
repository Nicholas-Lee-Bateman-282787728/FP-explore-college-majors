862029,4,6304383193,"Polly Parrish (Debbie Reynolds) works at the Merlin Department store. She gets fired for over-aggressive sales (too many of her sales are returned the next day). So on her last day on the job she is out on her lunch break looking for another situation. That is when she witnesses a baby being left on the steps of an orphanage. Afraid it will fall off, she goes to the rescue and is discovered ""leaving her baby""--so they think. After she has answered a few questions from the orphanage staff she realizes what they are thinking and scurries out. But they had learned her name and where she works. They track her down and discover from her employer that she had been fired that day. They deduce that she was concerned that she would no longer be able to care for her baby and that is why she ""abandon"" him. They convince young Mr. Merlin (the boss's son, played by Eddie Fisher) to give her back her job, and in the process he becomes involved with the ""family,"" and his father, John B. Merlin, Sr., becomes convinced that he is a grandfather. Things get pretty crazy as Polly believes that Mr. Merlin, Sr. is going to have her baby taken from her.

Though fun in its own way, this lacks the chemistry and wit of the original with David Niven and Ginger Rogers (in spite of the fact that Fisher and Reynolds were husband and wife, and parents of Carrie Fisher). Imdb trivia indicates that this was Fisher's acting debut and that he didn't care for this movie.

Unlike the original, this is a musical. Though the leads are both excellent musical talents, I prefer this story without the tunes. Even though much of the dialogue is the same from one movie to the other, it just doesn't seem to have the same spark in this version. Maybe it is just because I have enjoyed the original for so long, nothing can come close to it.

If you like the lead players and you like musicals, you will probably like this movie--it does have its own charm and I do own it, but if I could only have one, I would take the original. And be advised that these DVD-R products (which both this version and the original happen to be) are best played on ""play only"" machines, not player/recorders",1293840000,9,2171,4.43609022556391
862030,5,6304383193,"Never saw Eddie Fisher in anything before this....and I gotta say he was wonderful. Debbie, as always, is like a breath of fresh air.  The movie was wonderful, entertaining, heartwarming, the whole ball of wax. I just wish they still made movies like this. Today's garbage is all hack em up, sex em up, and swear a blue streak. Probably explains why I prefer to watch these old movies then TRY to find something in the theater worth watching.

862033,5,6304383193,"This was Eddie's chance to shine.  He'd had his own television shows for about three years before he made the mistake of marrying Debbie Reynolds.  It was not a marriage, but a publicity stunt which went bad.  She had to try to outshine him in his movie debut, but couldn't quite manage it.  I loved her in 'Tammy and the Batchelor' but then she was pretending to be a young, backward Southern girl in love with an older man who was pledged to someone else, a sophisticated pure-bred.

The baby was a delightful little actor.  He looked just like Buddy Hackett.  The Christmas theme set it off with beautiful Technicolor, and Eddie's 'mumbling' in the interview scene was reminiscent of someone I know.  Being the son of the store owner, he could have any girl he wanted, but he again made a mistake by choosing one he thought was 'experience' since she already had a child.

The music was spectacular.  This is Eddie at his best!",1130198400,3,930,4.548192771084337
862034,2,6304383193,"This movie aired recently on TCM. It was a remake of Bachelor Mother which starred Ginger Rogers.  Bachelor Mother was considerably better than this dud.
Basically the script is quite poor and not very funny. Eddie Fisher, while possesing a nice voice, just doesn't cut it as an actor. Debbie Reynolds does her usual good job but she simply can't carry this movie out of its mediocrity.
I feel I was quite generous in giving this movie two stars.",1055548800,7,446,4.6455696202531644
862035,5,6304383193,"Bundle of Joy  (1956)  98  minutes
Director: Norman Taurog  Studio: Turner Home Video
Adolphe Menjou, Una Merkel, Tommy Noonan, Debbie Reynolds, Eddie  Fisher
  Debbie  Reynolds  playing  as  Polly  Parrish  has  a  job  at  a  department  store  and  gets  fired  for  selling  too  much  merchandise.  People  end  up  bringing  the  merchandise  back  the  next  day.  When  she  got  fired  she  was  walking  home  looking  at  the  hiring  agencies  window  for  a  job.  When  she  proceeded  down  the  street  she  found  a  baby  on  the  steps  of  a  foundling  agency.  The  people  walked  out  and  saw  that  she  had  left  the  baby,  so  they  thought.  The  people  at  the  agency  talked  to  the  big  boss  at  her  job  and  explained  why  she  needed  her  job  back.  She  tried  to  tell  the  people  that  this  was  not  her  baby,  but  no  one  would  listen.  She  took  the  baby  in  and  loved  him  like  only  a  mother  would.  The  boss,  Dan  Merlin  got  involved  and  wanted  to  help  her.
  Everyone  she  tried  to  tell  the  story  too  did  not  believe  her  or  she  would  just  stop  because  it  sounded  crazy  that  something  like  this  would  happen  to  anyone.
  This  was  a  fairytale  of  sorts,  kind  of  like  Cinderella.  This  movie  was  in  color,  but  was  in  black  and  white  before.  Bundle  of  Joy  is  a  classical  and  a  musical  in  one.

  Dan  fell  in  love  with  the  fact  that  she  was  able  to  do  such  a  selfless  act.  Polly  and  Dan  got  married  so  she  did  not  have  to  work  anymore.  I  thought  this  movie  was  great  and  had  a  lot  of  heart  and  soul  to  it.  It  was  a  feel  good  movie.  It  makes  me  want  to  think  that  good  thing  do  happen  to  people.
  I  give  this  movie  ,  because  it  had  so  much  to  give  to  the  audience.  It  would  be  a  great  movie  to  take  to  you  Grand-mothers  house  and  enjoy  with  her.",1055462400,8,1971,4.142414860681114
862036,5,6304383193,"Why is it that Leonard Maltin is so critical about nice films that don't harm anyone in any way?  ""A Bundle of Joy"" might not be a film  that stimulates the brain cells but it is a jolly nice film all the same.  Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher are great as the mis-matched couple who  end up holding the baby, literally!  A musical remake of the 1930s film  ""Batchelor Mother"" this little film has a great musical score and  a nice little plot that is easy to follow.  When Reynolds an out of work  salesgirl finds an abandoned baby everyone thinks it is hers, and this is  the start of a comedy of errors that will have you laughing and crying in  the same breath.  Enter Eddie Fisher, Debbie's employer who thinking she  has abandoned her child because she has just lost her job, gives her back  her job along with the BABY and the laughs really start in earnest!  With  an adorable little boy to look after, Debbie has to juggle her life and her  job, whilst trying to convince everyone that she is not the boy's mother.  Add another complication in the form of Fisher's father played  magnificently by Adolphe Menjou who thinks he is a grandfather and sets  about claiming his grandchild, and you have a funny, gentle comedy that  gives you many a chuckle for the duration of the film.  So all you folks  that just want a nice little film to watch with no violence, no bad  language, and no nude scenes, then this film is for you.  It's well worth  adding to your video collection if you get the chance.",967248000,36,1508,4.3731884057971016

He is at his best however, with the songs performed throughout the film.  Adolphe Menmjou and Tommy Noonan are quite pleasing and lively throughout.  Plot focuses on a baby left on a doorstep and assumed to be single-girl Debbie Reynolds child.  Fisher is the store executive
who becomes involved in resolving the dilemma and eventually falls in love with Reynolds.  Menjou is Fisher's father who mistakenly believes he
is the grandfather of the baby.  Good fun with an update to an earlier plot that worked successfully in the past and does so once again.  Good fun

It's full of good songs and good laughs and features the cutest baby I've ever seen in a film.  He steals the show every time he's part of a scene with those blond curls of his and that cute little face.  He's too adorable for words.

At the time of making this movie, Debbie Reynolds was carrying Carrie Fisher. Once you know that and see the dance scene, it shows what a trooper Ms. Reynolds is. This is a remake of the Bundle of Joy originally staring Ginger Rogers and David Niven. This new one is definitely better especially with Eddie Fisher kicking it off with a great song.

Fisher and Reynolds were actually married at the time and Reynolds was pregnant with their first child, soon to become famous actress, Carrie Fisher. The movie's theme is interesting but the plot is a bit slow, however, Fisher and Reynolds have excellent rapor and harmonize beautifully.

Even though Eddie Fisher is no great actor, he makes up for it with his singing and young charm, and Debbie is at her best! I've always loved this movie and watch it nearly every year. A great Christmas and New Years movie, with really good songs. If you love the 50's style and feel, and you love Christmas and musicals, this is a perfect pick! The soundtrack is definitely recommended as well (Although I think it's only on LP).",1321401600,3,503,4.538461538461538
863925,2,6304383193,"Bundle of Joy is the story of a shop girl (Debbie Reynolds) who loses her job for being too eager to make good during the Christmas season. On her way to the employment office, she spots a baby on a doorstep, and being a good samaritan, she brings him to the orphanage. They will not take him, however, because they believe the baby is hers and that she made up a story to hide her embarrassment. Soon, the owner of the department store she was fired from and his son find out about the child and gives her her job back, and she has a fine time trying to convince everyone that the baby isn't really hers.

Reynolds works her way through a convoluted and unbelievable plot admirably, but her performance does not save the film. She said later in interviews that this movie was miserable to make, and it shows. I am utterly unimpressed with Fisher. His singing does nothing for me and he's a bland actor. Its a wonder he was ever as famous as he was, and the fact that his main claim to fame today is father Carrie Fisher and leaving Reynolds for Elizabeth Taylor is telling. Although I thought the movie would be fun since it stars a real-life husband and wife, I was sorely disappointed.",1318118400,2,1188,4.375565610859729

I hadn't realized there was a remake of the original black and white version, and since I like Debbie Reynolds and am typically a fan of musicals I decided to watch. I was very disappointed. The acting was inferior across the board from the Ginger Rogers version. Due to poor pacing and lackluster performances, Bundle of Joy couldn't inspire a laugh. It was a real dud compared to the comic romp of Bachelor Mother. Save your time and watch the original version.",1313712000,,646,4.52991452991453

Each and every character in this movie gives 100% to create such a sweet and amuzing story.
Debbie Reynolds rushes to make sure a baby left on a doorstep is safe and from that moment on this single girl becomes attached.
Eddie Fisher definitely makes the movie even more cute because you can tell he is in love with her on screen and off.
