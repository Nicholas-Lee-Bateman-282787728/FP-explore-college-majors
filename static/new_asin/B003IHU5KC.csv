4126686,5,B003IHU5KC,"This is one of my family's favorite shows of all time and I'm so glad we went ahead and ordered the set! Big Bang Theory is an intelligent, hilarious, laugh out loud funny series that you will enjoy whether you're a geek or not. If you are a geek and enjoy science fiction, comic books, MMORPG's (like World of Warcraft), Super Heroes, math, general science or physics it's even better. I would not call this an educational show, but it might spark an interest science or generally geekery. I even like the theme song. It's not for kids as there are many references to sex, but nothing that would offend the average adult in my opinion.

It's been a lot of fun watching the first season again; there were so many episodes we had forgotten. I laugh out loud at least a few times an episode and they are definitely consulting physicists because the physics related jokes are accurate and about real concepts (this was confirmed by an interview with the show's creators in one of the Special Features). There are some Special Features on some of the DVD's but so far not a ton (we are about halfway through Season 2). In the episodes we had already seen a few times in re-runs, we're still catching new subtle humor, SciFi references, physics jokes, or funny things in the background. There aren't many sitcoms I bother watching and this is the only one I can think of that stands up to multiple viewings.

I ordered with Free 2 Day Delivery through Amazon Prime and received my order in 24 hours. It was in great shape and as described. This is a great gift for anyone that enjoys intelligent humor, prides themselves in being a geek, loves comic books, gaming, science, etc. It's a great gift for those that are hard to shop for.",1310774400,6,1728,4.517571884984026
4126687,5,B003IHU5KC,"The Big Bang Theory is one of those rare shows that all my friends seem to be able to agree on. TBBT is undoubtedly one of the funniest shows ever; if it doesn't make you laugh out loud you either have no sense of humor or don't understand geek humor. The writing and acting are first-rate.
This box set simply packages the three individual season sets into one. All three seasons are excellent and well worth seeing. With at least three more seasons on the way, however, those seeking a complete box set will have to wait at least until 2014.",1297296000,2,543,4.3861386138613865
4126728,3,B003IHU5KC,"This is a hilarious series, however.  3 of the 48 shows I have watched so far had damaged disks,  causing parts of the show to be skipped.",1330819200,,138,4.074074074074074

4126730,5,B003IHU5KC,"I ordered these for Christmas, too late to arrive in time, but they did arrive and we have enjoyed them.",1326931200,,104,4.25
4126731,5,B003IHU5KC,My wife and I will sit for hours watching this show and laughing constantly. What a wonderful combination of 4 different types of geeks and the girl that is forced to put up with them. She has some of the best lines in the show. I hope the show continues for a long time.,1326585600,,271,4.037037037037037

4126734,5,B003IHU5KC,"At the end of the day I love to relax while watching a couple of episodes of Big Bang, & its great to watch them without the ads.  I'm a satisfied customer. Delivery was prompt too.",1325203200,,181,4.027777777777778
4126735,3,B003IHU5KC,"I bought these DVD's for my mother so she would have something to watch while taking Chemotherapy. She loves the show but has only seen re-runs out of sequence on TBS. I gave her seasons 1-3 for Christmas only to find that they will not play in our RCA DVD player nor my DVD ROM on my PC.  On the player it creates a message that says ""Disc not compatible"" and on my PC it just simply does not register a disc in the drive. The Discs do play in the portable DVD player I gave her for Christmas as well, but I am VERY upset with the selective way that these DVD's play. I am suspecting it has something to do with the copy protection, but I don't know why it would not play on my DVD player. It's crap like this that fuels the rip and burn campaign of the media pirates. It's a shame when the ""illegal"" media is more reliable, and user friendly, than the licensed ""professional"" originals. Now that I have proof that I bought the right to watch this material, I am considering going down to the local street corner and buying them from the pony tailed immigrant offering them with a photocopied cover, so I can watch a quality version of this media.( or maybe not, but it is tempting)

UPDATE: I bought a new DVD player and all 4 seasons of The Big Bang Theory do play in the new player. If you have a DVD player that is more than 4-5 years old I would suggest checking to see if these will play in your player.",1324771200,,1410,4.123636363636364

4126766,5,B003IHU5KC,"A really witty show that uses a great amount of large scientific words, but when Penny and other people don't know what they're talking about you still laugh. This sitcom could possibly one of the greatest in this 21st century forward, and could possibly be a candidate for all time. Regardless, the cast has great chemistry with each other, and there are the moments where actors are laughing in the scene, which shows how much fun the cast had in making this. It reflects upon the audience because I had fun watching this.",1315440000,,524,4.645161290322581

Personally, I guess I don't appreciate the nerdy humor this show presents, and I've never watched it, nor do I intend to. TV sitcoms are my least favorite genre and I don't watch them.",1389744000,,356,4.578125
