6564940,2,B00M97DPC2,"Debug is a Sci-Fi/horror film culled together from far better films such as Event Horizon, Tron, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.  In 2047, six young criminal computer hackers are sent to an abandoned space freighter as part of a prison release program.  They are tasked with debugging the ships computer network and rebooting its systems.  Unfortunately for the hackers, the ships security A.I. has no intention of being shut down.  Jason Mamoa plays the voice of the psychopathic security software, calling himself, I am, a bio-organic system that will do everything in its power to stop the hackers.

Although it is set on a mammoth freighter the film has the feel of a haunted house type film where the group breaks up to each explore the setting on their own, leaving them vulnerable to influence and attack.  First to be targeted is the groups prison supervisor, Capra (Holmes).  A drug addict, Capra attempts to use the ships pharmaceutical station to get his fix.  However, I Am takes controls of the automatic injection system, pumping Capra full of chemicals which turns him into a homicidal maniac who feels no pain.  As Capra begins to stalk the hackers, each of the group is encountering I Am on their own in the form of holograms or within virtual reality programs where it can play on their fears and insecurities.

There is little attempt made at character development.  We learn almost nothing about the characters except for James who took a hacking rap for his younger brother who has Down syndrome.  The rest of the characters are strictly two-dimensional cutouts just there to fill space until their demise.  The most intriguing member of the group is Kaida (Goossen), the lead programmer.  She is the toughest member of the group, physically and mentally.  Eventually Kaida sends a computer version of herself into the network to battle I Am meanwhile she and James search for the ship for I Ams bio-organic form to shut it down once and for all.

Writer/Director David Hewlett, best known for his work in front of the camera in shows such as Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, teases viewers with several interesting tidbits but he never follows up on them, leaving them dangling.  These involve who created I Am in the first place and what was the abandoned freighter carrying?  These intriguing questions unfortunately are never answered.  Its stated that bio-organics is strictly military grade stuff, hinting at some sinister purpose of the ship and its AI.  Its a shame that Hewlett didn't explore these points in more detail as they are frankly more interesting than the standard hunt and kill horror plotline.

Jeananne Goossen is the highlight of the film.  She is tough, strong, and intelligent and owns every scene that she is in.  This was a very different role for Mamoa who is known for his roles that are heavy on action.  Hes asked to do little of that here but is sufficiently menacing as the antagonist.  While Debug presents some interesting ideas it never fully embraces them and instead is satisfied with being a run-of-the-mill horror flick.

6564941,3,B00M97DPC2,"If you have seen 2001: A Space Odyssey (or Event Horizon Alien etc.), then you have practically seen Debug, a Canadian sci-fi thriller about computer programmers and artificial intelligence. Set in a deserted space freighter, Debug follows the story of a group of six hackers on work release, whose latest task is to debug the computer systems of a gigantic spaceship. Their mission goes terribly awry when the ships AI (played or personified by Jason Momoa) takes over the system, trapping all the crew inside.

The idea sounds interesting and the production designs are not bad. The film has also a nice twist in the story, but all these things are killed by poor execution. You know, clearly something is not right when characters, who should know what kind of situation they are in, keep doing stupid things, instead of sticking together.

What is worse is the lack of suspense. The pace is good, but the story doesnt have much to offer, and Momoas artificial intelligence (named I am) has no memorable traits of character to distinguish from better known ones, like HAL 9000 with Douglas Rains great voice.

The film is written and directed by David Hewlett best known for his role as Doctor Rodney McKay in the Stargate series. Debug could have been much more intriguing with more interesting interactions between characters (like in another Canadian thriller Cube in which Hewlett appears). As it is, Debug is just another example of a fine idea being wasted.",1429315200,7,1466,4.903225806451613

6564954,4,B00M97DPC2,"An interesting movie, and a fairly original concept. It's a moderate budget film, that looks better than many that you'd see on SyFy that probably had a much bigger pile of cash to work from. Good acting, good pacing of the story, and (for the most part) well cast. I normally don't watch anything that doesn't make 90 minutes running time (this one is a few minutes shy of the mark), but am glad that I made the exception.",1447977600,2,423,4.367088607594937

The underlying story is a lot of fun, and makes for a nice alone-in-the-dark movie evening.  These two were some of my favorites from the Stargate franchise, and the effects, sets, directing, and acting were all up to speed on this.  Definitely an enjoyable film, and one I'll likely watch again!",1495756800,,446,4.906666666666666
