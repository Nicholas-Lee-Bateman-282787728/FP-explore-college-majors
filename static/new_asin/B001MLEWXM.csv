8321418,5,B001MLEWXM,"My name is Nat Segaloff and I wrote, produced and directed this documentary for A&E's ""Biography"" series and this is a heck of a way to find out it's being distributed on home video! We made it in the mid-90s before the current crop of Marvel-based movies began appearing, so it's a little dated in that regard. But it's a loving and, I hope, moving profile of Stan Lee, his family, and the people who created the Marvel Universe. (As far as I know it hasn't been cut for home video).",1237420800,,484,4.329670329670329
