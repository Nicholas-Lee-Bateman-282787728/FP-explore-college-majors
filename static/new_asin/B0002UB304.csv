8031932,5,B0002UB304,"When I first heard of this anime, it peaked my interest. I personally love Great Teacher Onizuka (an ex-motorcycle gang leader who decides to become a teacher--slightly crude and perverted, but lovable in his own way). When I read this description, it looked like another great and similar anime but with a female in the role. I watched all of the 5 episodes straight and am dying for more. It isn't sci-fi, fantasy, romance-centered or the like but still is something that I believe a lot of people can enjoy.

Kumiko Yamaguchi is a wonderful character. I think she's awesome and couldn't be happier with her. Despite being able to kick serious but, not to mention a big-time Yakuza gang backing her up, she dons the role of an air-head to fulfil her dream of becoming a teacher. The trouble students have another thing coming though if they think that she's just what she seems, and one observant student already has his suspicions. Her double role and personality inevitably wavers to her true personality despite her efforts. Every episode was fun to watch.

I was sad that amazon had no cover picture. It bares noting that the animation for this series is wonderful and among my favorite. Though definitely in the anime style, it has more realism tones to the character's looks. The animation is everything you could hope for.

Where I understand where the other reviewer is coming from, I (as is habit when it's an anime I haven't seen) tried the English version first so had no problems or disappointments in that area. I think the dub version was excellent. I'm picky and often I'll prefer the japanese, but just like certain dubs like Trigun or GTO, I'm pleased with their english voices.

I highly recommend this series!",1102636800,,1730,4.756666666666667
