8341339,1,B001TH2DY4,"I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this item and actually found it somewhere else for much cheaper. Had I seen the reviews here I would most definitely have not bought it.

The actors are annoying and the ""instructors"" are dimwitted, arrogant, and DO NOT TEACH ANYTHING about tantra.  The best part of this DVD is the narrator who gives a nice history about tantra, but that is worth maybe five minutes out of the hour long DVD.  This is not a guide but some loosely cobbled vignettes where nothing is explained.  If you like old men who don't know how to smile (yup - just like one reviewer said, the old male actor is always frowning) this might be a DVD for you.

The other reviewer is quite correct - part of this DVD plays like an infomercial.  So before ordering, ask yourself this: would you pay $19.95 to watch an infomercial?",1290729600,6,836,4.396103896103896
8341340,3,B001TH2DY4,"All the people(90%) in video are sex therapist. So i don't know about other videos they have done, But even tho you will see Jiaya breast and pubic hair you won't see much more even when the yoni massage are done. Same with male gential massage its started but not complete. They are few group scenes with the other noted therapist but most time they are advising these 2. So if your buying it for erotic purposes forget it.",1283644800,3,424,4.379746835443038
8341341,1,B001TH2DY4,"An update to my review: This has to do with the truthfulness of the previous two reviewers (who give this item four and five stars), whom I believe are in some way associated with the production of this DVD.  If you look at the other DVD they have both reviewed (The Guide to Sex Positions of the Kama Sutra), their reviews are almost verbatim what you will read here - odd that the same two people are watching the same stuff given the huge amount of DVDs out there on the topic of sensual massage.  It is also odd that these same two people are only reviewing programs that star Jaiya and John Hanauer.

-------
The only thing I learned from this DVD:  Breathing is important.
I already knew that and do a pretty good job if I do say so myself.

The style of this DVD tries to be instructional, but it falls short of that goal.  This is nothing more than a glorified infomercial.  There are instructors with questionable credentials instructing a couple in the ways of tantra.  But about 70% of the time the couple or instructors fail to actually explain what they are doing!  There's a lot of man rubbing woman, woman rubbing man with soft piano music in the background, but absolutely no explanation about what's going on - what the benefit is, and how it relates to tantra.  About 20% of the time is devoted to naked couples at a retreat singing the praises of tantra.  That's great, but really I think it's just a masked advertisement for the people running these retreats.  They don't explain anything about what they are doing and why - other than to say ""tantra is great, tantra is magic"" and go on about how it's so great to pour honey on each other while naked but how that's just not possible at home.

I find it hard to believe that most couples would be able to sit through this DVD.  Some of what the instructors ask the student couple to do is far from what most couples would want to do or even feel comfortable doing (for example: making loud guttural noises while in a pseudo-doggy style position).

The real life couple (tantra students) in this DVD is slightly off-putting, and most definitely not ""HOT"" as described by one of the other reviewers (though I suppose beauty is in the eye of the beholder).  In fact, they are not a real life couple but actually ""sex educators"" who are trying to make a few bucks off this poorly assembled production.  The male component of the couple has a perpetual frown, looks decrepit, and is a stark contrast to the abnormally big-hipped but much younger looking female component.  The instructors (and there are many of these) have a mildly creepy and elitist edge about them; some come off as ditzy and some come off as just plain arrogant (""I have a PhD in physics but now I have tantric sex all day blah blah blah"").  They are all a bit on the older side - if this DVD had a younger crowd (someone my girlfriend and I could identify with) it might not have been as bad.

The production quality of this DVD is quite low - it looks as though it was shot with a camcorder purchased at a department store and the editing done on a 1990s desktop computer.  When couples are in front of a scenic backdrop, for example, it's clear that they have just been ""Photoshopped"" onto a poster picture - very poorly I might add.  In fact, the reason for including these scenic panoramas is never made clear - I think it's meant to be eye candy (a sexually energized couple in front of a sunset or snow capped mountains . . . that gets my engine running; Rrrrrrrrrrrr!), but really this just means that there is that much less time available for the instructor to talk about more important things like massage.

If I could, I would return this item for a full refund without hesitation and get something else.  I would strongly recommend to others considering this DVD to purchase something else or get a book on the subject - I think that would be more fun than sitting through this hour long poorly produced piece of ----.",1283558400,26,3968,4.433884297520661

It doesn't hurt that the tantra ""students"" are both HOT!",1237766400,7,178,5.137931034482759
8341343,5,B001TH2DY4,This is one of the best erotic videos we have seen.  It explains how to give really great massages and shows real couples exploring each other's bodies.  This has definitely helped my husband and I spice up our sex life.,1236211200,9,220,4.475
