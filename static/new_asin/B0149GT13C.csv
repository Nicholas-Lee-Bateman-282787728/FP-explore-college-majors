8730106,5,B0149GT13C,"I bought this CD as part of the full series boxset.  This is a North American region DVD.  It contains some very funny holiday episodes which are: Mammy's ass, Mammy's Christmas, The Virgin Mammy, Buckin' Mammy, Who's a Pretty Mammy, Mammy's Tickled Pink, and Mammy's Gamble.  This is more adult humor than child-friendly humor however it's nothing that I find inappropriate to have on the TV when my kids are around.  It's heart warming, silly Irish holiday comedy.  If you are a person who is easily offended and become morally outraged over little things then you would probably not enjoy this fun series.  My favorite episode is the one with the singing christmas tree in it - so many funny moments!  In many ways this show reminds me of family Christmases with my family who immigrated from the UK originally.",1477699200,5,814,4.771428571428571
