8462206,5,B0058QFZYC,"I have six shows listed at MyAnimeList with 10/10 ratings; Dennou Coil is one of these.  It follows a bunch of ten-year-olds as they navigate their way through a virtual reality world that overlays a small Japanese city.  To experience this world, you need to wear special glasses.  For the kids it's a remarkable playground where you can carry out battles, or raise strange creatures, or play with virtual pets.  However when one of the kids is run over by an automated car, they begin to wonder if there aren't some darker forces at work behind the scenes.

The two principals are both transfer students named Yuko who are quickly nicknamed ""Yasako"" and ""Isako.""  Yasako has a lot of experience with the ""dennou"" (""cyber"") world, but nothing like the powers young Isako wields.  She is in pursuit of the mysterious ""illegals,"" virtual creatures left behind in abandoned virtual ""spaces,"" that she hopes to use to help revive her comatose brother.  Along the way we meet a bunch of boys who form the Hackers Club, a talented girl hacker named Fumie who befriends Yasako, Yasako's grandmother who sells the kids illegal software to carry out their activities, and some other delightfully eccentric characters.

Dennou Coil was the brainchild of director Iso Mitsuo, best known for his ""sakuga"" work in famous shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Iso peddled his treatment for the story for some seven years before finally convincing Madhouse and the NHK public television network to produce it.  Most anime are adaptations of other works like manga, novels, and more recently videogames, which helps explain why Iso faced so many roadblocks to getting an original story like Coil produced. Luckily for us he persisted, though he has pretty much left the industry since this show was released in 2007.

My only problem with this version is that it costs $300 and has no English subtitles.  There is a much more affordable DVD release from Australia's Siren Visual,. but you need a DVD player that can handle Region 4 releases.",1452384000,,2025,4.938053097345133
