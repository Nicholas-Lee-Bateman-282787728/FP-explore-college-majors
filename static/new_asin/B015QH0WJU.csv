7446348,4,B015QH0WJU,"I bought this review because it's high intensity and intevals. Unfortunately when they are doing one of the  larger workouts (larger group of participants), the long shots mean you can't really see the cueing for the  intervals and follow the person you need to follow. It's paced very quickly.... which it should be but it's not for beginners. I am a semi-beginner in HIIT but I have been working out consistently for well over a  year + doing some interval workouts and lots of strength and some stamina.
I like the concept but I wish he gave more  cues.  I will just have to keep working on this one for a while to get a good handle on it.",1469318400,5,642,4.361344537815126

8734299,4,B015QH0WJU,Is what it is.  HIIT is where fitness is headed and for a good reason.,1527292800,,70,3.6666666666666665
8734300,5,B015QH0WJU,"I have finished each of these workouts once and feel that they are awesome!! I wish I would have known about this one sooner.
There is no doubt about it, this is a challenging workout. I consider my fitness level to be intermediate, so for some of the moves, I can follow Brett and others I have to follow the modifier. My heart rate gets up there and I feel my abs engaged through most of the workout. A win-win for sure. I do plan to order the trilogy from the 20-minute body website in the near future.",1525392000,,505,4.163265306122449
8734301,5,B015QH0WJU,Love HIIT workouts.  This is an awesome dvd.,1518998400,,44,4.5
8734302,5,B015QH0WJU,"I have never sweated so much. You will not be disappointed. I wasn't and the cost is unbelievable, until $10.00. I love it so much, I even posted the dvd to my friends on  My Fitness Pal application, if they wanted a awesome workout.",1513987200,,233,4.295454545454546
8734303,5,B015QH0WJU,"I bought the entire Brett Hoebel DVD collection of 20-minute body routines exclusively for the bonus item, which is the 20-minute Cardio Capoiera.  I love this routine.  Used to follow it on-demand with Comcast but they pulled it off their program rotation and I had to find it so I could continue to work out with it.  It's very easy to follow and he cues well.  After one or two times, you'll be totally comfortable with it.  I'm an experienced workout ""diva""-  Jazzercised for almost 30 years and now that I can't do that where I live, I've modified my routine to daily (outdoor) biking and various forms of aerobics via DVD at home.  This cardio capoiera fits in well with my other exercise routines and gets my heart rate up sufficiently.  The other routines included in this DVDs of 20-minute Body are a bit  too intense for me, perhaps meant for younger people.",1510531200,,868,4.584415584415584
8734304,5,B015QH0WJU,"He's a fantastic trainer. I've never done Capoeira before but he walks you through it. You should already be at intermediate exercise level. This is not for beginners. With warm up and cool down, the whole thing is 30 min, but it goes by super fast.",1506988800,,249,4.434782608695652
8734305,5,B015QH0WJU,"Love, love, love this video. 20 minutes is all it takes for a great workout!!",1487635200,,77,4.2
8734306,5,B015QH0WJU,"I bought the first video to see if I would like the workouts. I found the workouts to be great so I ended up getting the full series. I have done 90 day supreme, hard corps, p 90x and this workout is physically the same but Brett Hoebel is more unique less traditional working more with body weight and less of the traditional moves so you feel your muscles are wing challenged in a different way. He also has a fun personality.",1479859200,2,428,4.2317073170731705
