8304649,3,B001GAH9XO,"The original title is ""Tell Your Children."" aka Dope Addict (1938), aka Doped Youth (1938), aka Love Madness (1938), aka Burning Question, The (1939), aka Reefer Madness (1947).

This is an educational movie that shows you what they do not want you to know about the seamy side of burning hemp.

A tale by Dr. Carroll (Joseph Forte) of May Colman (Thelma White) and Jack Perry (Carleton Young) distributors. Their dealings with high school students that look like they flunked a few grades. There are many overlapping scenarios; one is which Ralph, under the influence, helps Mary with her inhabitations towards disrobing. Some time during this trying evening Mary is all shot. Others are rundown and some Grin and grin and grin and bear it.

A side note Mary and Ralph (Dorothy Short and Dave O'Brien) in real life were married to each other at the time of the movie.

Being a cult classic does not give it any better production rating.
You may just want rent this film first as it is not really one for re-watching",1495756800,,1016,4.691011235955056
8304650,2,B001GAH9XO,"Reefer Madness, made as an exploitation film in 1936, would have us believe that marijuana is the devil's weed from hell.  Worse than heroin!  Worse than cocaine!  Marijuana will blow your brain, shrivel your soul, and land you smack-dab into a nuthouse or a cemetery!

According to the prologue, marijuana was rampaging through the high schools in 1936 and was about to undermine the foundations of the Republic.  Here we meet Bill and Mary, two squeaky-clean kids (well, they're supposed to be kids but they look like they're on the far side of twenty-five) who get drawn into a marijuana den and suffer all kinds of dire consequences.  A kid stoned on pot drives down the street like a bat out of hell and runs down a pedestrian, all the while laughing like a maniac.  The good girl is shot dead and the good boy is framed while zonked out of his cranium.  The good boy is seduced by the bad woman, who ends up taking a swan dive from the courthouse window as penance for her sins.  The requisite courthouse climax neatly ties up all the loose ends.  Every clich you can think of is piled into the movie, all in the space of sixty-six minutes.

The movie is god-awful, over-acted, over-played and over-dramatized, and the hysteria rolls along at a fever pitch, but in light of what has been known for years about marijuana (it's not physically addicting nor does it cause people to suddenly start dancing like whirling dervishes or slaughter their families under the influence), it's all so over the top that all you can do is sit back and laugh at the silliness.  Watch this movie some night when you're bored out of your gourd and need a few giggles.  On that score, at least, it delivers.

8304651,5,B001GAH9XO,"This review is for anyone who KNOWS the real effects of the ""Last Dance with Mary Jane""...

If you were to trip on CID and have a vision about the most preposterous version of the effects of Weed on the brain...THIS movie is what you would probably see...

Enough of these reviews give away enough of the movie BUT what I will say is that MJ leads to hysteria, hallucinations, murder & rape!!!  Probably the most prolific Cult Classic of all time, Reefer Madness is both an Exploitation and Propaganda Film.  Watch it and learn.",1227830400,,528,4.526315789473684
8304652,5,B001GAH9XO,"This movie is absolutely hilarious and the fact that the creators tried to play it off in later years is even funnier.  It was their claim that the acting and OVER DRAMATIZATION where done on purpose.  If that was the case, then the film itself would have been useless.  This is an Exploitation Film, plain and simple.  The premise of the movie is that if you smoke ""Reefers"" (MJ Cigs) you will go out of your mind and committ horrible acts resulting in jail and insanity!!!  The movie has been beat up by the public domain but this is actually a good copy of this movie and probably the best currently available through Amazon directly.",1226016000,2,637,4.504347826086956
8304653,4,B001GAH9XO,"I don't know if this film was made to intentionally be as ridiculous as it is.  I have read reviews to that effect.  All I know is that you will laugh your butt off.  I tried to watch the colorized version and it actually gave me a headache.  The colors were way to ""Pastel.""  Made as an ""Exploitation Film"", Reefer Madness claims that ""The Dread Menace"" Marijuana is worse than ALL other drugs, including Heroin and Cocaine!!!  The film also claims that your children will go INSANE if they smoke dope and end up running people over and get framed for murder...

You absolutely must own this Cult Classic so that you can see how propaganda played such a huge role in the times.  Reefer Madness is absolute awesome.",1224201600,2,715,4.488372093023256
8304654,5,B001GAH9XO,"Made over the course of 3 weeks (most Exploitation films were shot in a few days), using an experienced director and a couple of talented actors who went on to have respectable careers in Hollywood, Reefer Madness is quite simply the finest Exploitation film to come out of the 30's.",1224115200,2,283,4.68
8304655,5,B001GAH9XO,"""Reefer Madness"" (originally ""Tell Your Children"") was created to teach parents that it's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids. Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin. We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.

Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:
- laughing maniacally while running people down in the street
- playing the piano too fast
- having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much
- accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well
- having no recollection of being framed for murder

This movie is a cult classic and should be owned by anyone with a sense of humor.",1224028800,2,875,4.788079470198675
