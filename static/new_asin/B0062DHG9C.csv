8491122,4,B0062DHG9C,There are few films that manage to combine with even a little modicum of success the disparate genres of romantic comedy and crime drama. MY SCARY GIRL does this quite well. Hwang Dae Woo (Park Yong Woo) is a thirtyish university lecturer who is as innocent and virginal as a man can be. He meets and falls for Lee Mina (Choi Kang Hee) an art student who is secretly a serial killer. Their gradual falling in love combines with his growing realization of her criminal past to produce in the mind of the viewer that love and death are not that far distant. MY SCARY GIRL was a low budget Korean indie that was a huge hit and made stars of the leads. It is a fascinating descent into the murky world where passion can and does lead to unexpected twists in the Road of Life.,1402185600,,771,4.287671232876712

I loved watching the zany best-girlfriend of the heroine; she was so subtly funny she must be a comedienne in ""real life.""

It's Korean, so not everything makes sense at all times, but that's cultural. I am always astonished at how reall teriffic the Korean actors are at crying (weeping). It just comes to them and they can make the eyes well up and the tears flow, as needed.

Thgis film is KIND OF reminiscent of the old Alfred Hitchcock mysteries, like ""The Trouble With Harry."" I recommend this film. You won't ""learn"" a thing, but you'll have a good time.

No nudity :(",1375401600,,729,4.592307692307692
