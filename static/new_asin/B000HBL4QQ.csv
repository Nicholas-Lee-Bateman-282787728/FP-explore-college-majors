8137974,5,B000HBL4QQ,"I got this because I have seen Charlie Rose interviews before and he is the best talk show interviewer in the world, he asks much more detailed questions than other talk show hosts and he creates a very casual personable feeling when he's talking to famous people, he makes it feel like they're just sitting in his living room having a casual friendly conversation. It sounds more like a real conversation that you would have with a friend than like a press interview with stereotyped questions. When I watch Charlie Rose, I don't feel like the famous person is being interviewed, I feel like they're just talking. So I decided that if I ever want to learn more about the life, opinions and feelings of any actor or director that I admired, I can learn more about a person from Charlie Rose interview than from anything else. I've been a James Garner fan my whole life but I'd never heard many interviews of him and never knew much about his feelings about the work he's done, and I wanted to learn more about the man cuz I thought he was a really nice guy, a regular guy. So I found this Charlie Rose with James Garner DVD for only 7 or 8 dollars, where most Charlie Rose DVD's are 24 dollars, so I grabbed this James Garner DVD real quick, I was so pleased to get it cheap. I learned more about Jim than I ever had before from listening to this casual homey conversation and I'm so glad that I got to hear this. I think James Garner is one of the nicest people in the world. And I have a lot in common with him, growing up a poor Oklahoma country hillbilly. So I feel a kinship connection with him for that. I admire him as a person as much as I do as an actor. A lot of characters he played were my best friends during some of my lonely troubled times. He just had some magical ability to make me feel better in my life, to not let trouble get me down. I'm really grateful for James Garner's presence in my life. I love him.",1324339200,2,1927,4.224932249322493
