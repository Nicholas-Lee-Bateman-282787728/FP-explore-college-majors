Not only due to the fact that he has been performing for more than fifty-five years, but more so because he has a talent unlike any other.  A comedic talent that endures and allows him to say what the public is thinking, and not only get away with would be considered politically incorrect, but garners laughter from all.

As a stand-up comedian Rickles can still fill theatres, but he has always struggled to play against type.  You want a fast witted razor sharp tongue; Rickles is your guy.  If you want a versatile character actor; Don may not be the first guy you call.  Never has this been more obvious than in his TV specials of the early seventies which can be seen in this new release.

The Don Rickles TV Specials Volume 1 was released from Time Life on October 7th and contains ninety minutes of material including The Many Sides of Don Rickles from 1970 and Don Rickles: Alive and Kicking from 1972.  Its ironic that The Many Sides of Don Rickles was on ABC, and Don Rickles; Alive and Kicking was on CBS who also gave life to The Don Rickles Show that same year.  Obviously there was recognition of Rickles talent and appeal; they just didn't know what to do with him.  At least not until NBC was able to glean a modicum of success by putting the character Rickles took on stage and put it into an environment in which it could flourish.  CPO Sharkey would last for two seasons.

In both TV specials Rickles plays against type in most of the poorly written sketches that leave even the legendary comedic talents of Harvey Korman, Don Adams, and Anne Meara, chewing scenery.

In The Many Sides of Don Rickles, there is a clear effort to try and do something completely different.  The show has a backstage feel to it when it opens with Don Rickles, Don Adams, Harvey Korman, and Robert Goulet sitting and talking in what is meant to be a casual environment.  The comedy here should be comfortable amongst men that are clearly friends, but it seems forced as the others attempt to let Rickles do his thing.  The backstage theme remains constant as they transition between sketches and a Goulet musical number.  The most unusual and uncomfortable segment to be found on this single DVD release is when Rickles sits down with three Psychologists to discuss his humor.  The doctors don't seem to know why they are there, Rickles get defensive, and the whole piece just drags without a clear direction.

Things get slightly better in Don Rickles; Alive and Kicking simply because the special open with Rickles doing a little kicking as he does the audience work he is known for.  Sadly that is the highlight as we once again are subjected to poorly written sketches.  There are pleasant cameos by Bob Newhart, Carroll O Connor, Jonny Carson, and Don Adams, and Juliet Prowse performs an enjoyable dance number. Ultimately far more traditional than the first special, the writing causes this show to fall well short of Special.

Rickles introduces both specials with segments that are too short.  Only slightly longer is the bonus feature in which Rickles receives the Legend Award from TV Land.

On the plus side; both specials look and sound great.

Recommendation: We love you Don but this was not the format to truly display your talent.

There is a release due out later this month that is to include this DVD, as well as volume 2, and the complete TV series CPO Sharkey.  Buy that, open it, and throw this DVD away.",1444867200,5,3490,4.6142625607779575
