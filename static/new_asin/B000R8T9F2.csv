2861973,4,B000R8T9F2,"I cant get his show on cable anymore, so I was shappy to be able to get some of his videos. My wife and I enjoy them a lot, but the quality of the recording is poor and it could really use some remastering.",1284940800,14,206,3.7045454545454546
2861974,5,B000R8T9F2,"I first encountered Bishop Fulton Sheen when I was a preteen viewing his Life Is Worth Living television series, and I would never miss even one of his telecasts. His inspirational oratory influenced my life for the better in many ways. The Faith, Hope and Love DVD series brought back wonderful memories of those past programs and reinforced the lessons I learned from them. Bishop Sheen captures his audience with his commanding, yet friendly presence as he goes on to explain in simple terms the realities of Faith, Hope, and Love. Of course, the greatest of these is Love, and one realizes this through his many verbal illustrations. If you have love, you will have hope and faith. One can have faith but no love. One can have hope without love. But only can one have it all with Love. Yet, Bishop Sheen does not ""preach."" He does not try to convince anyone to become Roman Catholic. Instead, he shows the universal relationship between God and man from the beginning, how it was lost and how to retrieve it. This man will amaze you with his honesty and knowledge, and above all his very own Faith, Hope and Love that radiates from him.",1281398400,16,1140,4.620689655172414
2861975,5,B000R8T9F2,"Bishop Sheen was one of the first TV evangelists and the most popular of all, outdrwaing Frank Sinatra and Milton Berle who appeared in the same time slot. The latter complained he did it with old material. Bishop Sheen based his talks on Catholic Values but rarely directly preached Catholism. Rather his story telling and wit drew the audience into his point of view. Although it was many many years ago I can remember his comparison of the chicken yard of Rhoad Island Reds to the communists of his day and of course there is the story of the man who bought an expensive sausage which he promised not to eat during lent.

I have listen to years of bad sermons. I just wish more priests to tell a story as well as he.",1273622400,16,719,4.365671641791045
2861976,5,B000R8T9F2,"I bought this set simply because I remembered watching Bishop Sheen on television when I was growing up in the Sixties.  As a Grade school kid I was able to relate to his message, and always chose to watch his program with no encouragement from my parents.  In fact, I often watched him and they seldom watched him.  As of this writing I am about halfway through watching this set, and I am happy to find his messages inspirational and timely today.  His wit and ability to spin a tale as he teaches about the Bible is truly timeless.  I just wish there was a ""complete"" Bishop Sheen set on DVD.  Video quality is good for 1960's television.",1256515200,34,641,4.389830508474576

8199443,3,B000R8T9F2,"One of the most interesting things culturally that I have benefitted from by watching  the Catholic cable station is the showings of the Bishop Fulton Sheen show from years ago. Those shows are like time capsules. They tell you so much about the country at the time, and especially about the desiderata of the Catholic Church at that period in American history. The most salient matter is simply the many, many  times that anti-Communist rhetoric  made its way into the show, often in episodes that would seem otherwise to have no connection to such issues. Ockham's Razor tells you that such anti-Communist rhetoric was the underlying reason for whatever ""unifying"" feelings Sheen may have elicited in viewers who were not Catholic. But the other very salient issue is just how many, many times Sheen seems to simply use examples which seem prima facie likely to be false. The audience did not seem to care, even though a moment's thought would have made a reasonable person wonder-- can this fellow's examples to make a point actually be trusted? There are a huge number of such examples. But one of the best I caught just the others day. It was an episode about what  the true nature of higher education should be, and of course he was trying to paint  a very scattered  portrait of modern education. By contrast, he actually extolled a more Medieval and Thomistic form for the modern world, though tellingly he did not identify its source Aquinas, He made it sound like this was a model that everyone would naturally agree to, no matter their religion. Yet the real howler came when he tried to give funny-sounding examples of the outrages in Modern education. He gave two examples; ""A PhD. Dissertation about Four Kinds of Ham"" and  ""A PHD. Dissertation on ways of Washing Dishes."" Of course he added that he was being nice and not identifying  which University produced these outrages. The audience laughed, and Sheen made his point. But a moment's thought makes it clear that these examples are likely totally made up. Sheen either so mangled some scientific research topic with tangential  relation to the ""ham"" and ""dish washing"", as to make it unrecognizable. Or more likely, he just created it out of whole cloth. And the amazing thing is that almost every episode has such an example of pure and likely prima facie fabrication. I think this style of deception for a cause, so to speak, likely culturally  influenced whole generations of Catholics. Surely one sees this same lamentable tendency in some Catholic leaders today, and especially on the Catholic cable channel. It seems quite entertaining the Sheen did it, because he was such a good showman. But fabrication is not a harmless tendency, and there's the rub culturally.",1449360000,,2741,4.875268817204301
