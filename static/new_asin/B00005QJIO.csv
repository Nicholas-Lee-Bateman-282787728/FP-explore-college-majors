7950637,1,B00005QJIO,"This is not a Leslie Cheung film, I wonder why it's listed under Leslie Cheung's. Although the name is the same as Leslie cheung's film ""Fatal Love"" in English, it confused people, since the introduction of the film said, starred by Leslie Cheung and Cherie Chung, it's a big mistake !

I'm afraid I cannot rate this one, cos' I don't have any idea about this film, I'm only familiar with the film ""Fatal Love"" starred by Leslie Cheung and Cherie Chung, definitely NOT this one !!!

Seemed that I was unable to post this review if I don't give any rate to this film, therefore I reluctantly rate it as ""1 star"", I definitely don't want to give any rating to it, NOT EVEN ONE !!!",1175558400,2,678,4.330708661417323
7950638,3,B00005QJIO,"There are two HK films with this title. I'm reviewing the version starring Michael Wong and Ellen Chan. Wong plays a businessman and murder suspect. Lovely Ellen Chan is the undercover cop out to nail him for a string of murders. She forgets her duty and falls in love with him. Lots of sexual content, frontal nudity and violence. I liked the story and the ending. I could have done without much of the violence and frontal nudity. Wong has generally played handsome good guy roles and I had trouble watching his performance as a psychopath. He was very believeable and frightening.",1094774400,22,583,4.7254901960784315
