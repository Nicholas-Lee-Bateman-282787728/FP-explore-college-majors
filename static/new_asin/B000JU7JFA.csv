8217900,1,B000JU7JFA,"This mockumentary starts out good, but seemingly spirals downhill for the whole two hours. Depressing. Not ""hilarious"" as it states on the cover. Not realistic or lifelike enough to see it as good comedy. Not worth watching.",1281484800,,224,5.081081081081081
8217901,5,B000JU7JFA,"I'm not sure how I went so long without knowing about this mini-series.

At only two hours long, it's a great depiction of film festivals.

Good dark humor that won't leave you disappointed.

If you enjoyed this, check out Best In Show, The Tournament, Trailer Park Boys and Blackballed.",1173052800,,287,4.816326530612245
