8495607,4,B0069WJHZW,"Great way to be introduced to the elemental information.  Tanis has many great books, and her brief videos are a great way to get started down a very interesting path.",1489104000,,167,4.566666666666666
8495608,4,B0069WJHZW,"While Tanis Hlliwell's interview is enjoyable, this is a very short, 25 minute video--if you watch the bit on YouTube, well, for the money, you have spent for a full length DVD, to get around 15 minutes. It's still nice to watch--it would be great if they reduced the price to around $8-10, for the length, or created an update, to make it longer. Her enthusiasm and message is a strong one.",1489104000,,391,4.444444444444445

 It helps I'm sure to be a ""believer"" already though. And FYI She Does give The Same info in her books.
I loved her Summer With The Leprechauns book and this was the perfect way to share what she learned with my husband who never gets around to reading a book no matter what the subject. We are both open to Nature Spirits because of our own ""otherness"" experiences. Her books end with a person wishing they had more,or more details, and she blames their length on her friend Lloyd; so I see his hand in how short This was too. It's a leprechaun thing!
 This DVD was a way for me to get an ""in person"" feeling for an author I've enjoyed and to share her ideas with others. It's too short and beautifully done to get ""bored"",that's for sure! But it is ""deep"" for those who take it to heart. Do not expect a lot of real pictures of Nature Spirits or explainations of the photography. That's a very briefly done bit. ONE of the few pictures shown wow'd me but don't expect too much. To love the DVD you've Got to love the whole subject! Then it's easy to give it 5 stars. I had a lot more fun looking for all the elemental faces in the bushes where she is sitting when the camera shows her talking! IF you have the eye for it,or have taken your own Nature Spirit pictures, you can find plenty behind/around her and it's fun.
 Tanis' gentle,happy and beautiful way of speaking on the subject is really what makes this so very nice to watch. She's wonderful and very matter-of-fact. She covers her categories quickly but meaningfully. We enjoyed watching it twice in a row to soak it in better and will watch it again whenever we want a refresher of how to be closer to our land and the earth!",1365638400,9,1783,4.207602339181286
