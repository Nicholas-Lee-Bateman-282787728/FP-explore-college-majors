3000296,5,B000XA6RUE,"Wow, this is an INTENSE workout.  Leslie says it's advanced and she is not kidding. The walks are really fast, even the ones that have the ""boosters.""  Be aware that you do need the hand weights (as advertised in this link, but it seems that the company offering this package doesn't have the weights anymore) as well as the waist belt with resistance bands and a ""stretchie"" (which is what Leslie calls a resistance band).  You can do the workout without this equipment, but it certainly does add intensity. What is nice is that you have the option of doing the whole 5 mile workout, or you can choose from some three-mile options that are a combination of the five one-mile segments in this DVD. There is also an option to shut off the talking and just hear the music once you have learned the routines. There is some nice stretching at the end. I will say that there is some problem with the cueing of the moves, mostly because this workout is so fast. If you watch the veterans that are walking behind Leslie (Joann and Linda) you will be fine.  Overall, if you are looking for a very intense walk-at-home DVD, this is the one for you.",1336262400,5,1139,4.435406698564593
3000297,5,B000XA6RUE,One of Leslie Sansone's  best DVDs. A great work out. It is always interesting to see the different moves Leslie incorporates into her videos.,1332806400,,142,4.916666666666667
3000298,1,B000XA6RUE,"This product is NOT what it appears to be.  It is a re-print of an older video (I already own this video in different, much more professional packaging.  This appears to be made on someone's home computer.  It is five miles, but only one mile uses weights.  From the description I read, I thought this was a five mile video using weights in some point of every mile.  Very misleading.  And, the video DID NOT come with hand weights.  Extremely mis-leading. I gave it a star because the video is a good workout.",1317859200,6,510,4.419354838709677
3000299,5,B000XA6RUE,"MAN OH MAN, did one of the workout options which was the 3 mile walk with hand weights and they kept my heart rate in between 72-78 percent the whole time almost from the beginning unlike the other five mile Leslie DVD which starts every mile slow like a warm up. my legs hurt today, and i tried doing two more miles after resting from the 3 miles, but had no more energy. if you are looking for a fast DVD with lots of different pre-programed workout options this is for you. One of the miles is 9 1/2mph,yikes! this was worth the money and it got here on time:) the only complaint is that it didn't come with hand weights like it says,but i have two already that i got at walmart so not a big deal.",1276819200,10,700,4.079710144927536
3000300,5,B000XA6RUE,Love this video. It's almost an hour in length and Leslie introduces you to light jogging with handweights. This is  a great challenging workout that will get you results. I've lost over 21 pounds thanks to Leslie!,1219968000,11,214,4.783783783783784
3000301,5,B000XA6RUE,I used this set for only two weeks and lost 12 pounds.  very energetic and fun.  the weight are pretty pink and easy to use.  I loved it,1208390400,7,136,3.7857142857142856
3000302,2,B000XA6RUE,"I purchased this product for my wife. she used it for about a month she told me she liked it. but I couldn't tell if she was telling the truth. The DVD was corney but if it made my wife happy thats good, I guess. took long time for the product to get to me, was not happy about that.",1207526400,,283,3.7333333333333334

8227611,5,B000XA6RUE,I have been walking with this lady for years. Good fitness resource.,1522108800,,68,4.75
8227612,5,B000XA6RUE,Love this walking at home dvd. So much more exercise than just walking outside. She has moves you would not do if neighbors were watching you walk outside.,1520380800,,155,4.571428571428571
8227613,5,B000XA6RUE,"As a woman well over 70, this is a great video for aerobic walking in your own home that helps condition the whole body.  The instructions are easy to follow and you can increase or decrease the intensity based on your fitness level.  This is a great way to get some exercise at a time of your choosing and be able to pick 1, 2, 3, 4 and/or 5 mile segments according to your physical state and time available.  That is a such great feature and some of Leslie Sansone's newer videos are not in 5 mile segments or as comprehensive.  Leslie and the others in the video are great to watch and are more personable than the people in her newer more professional videos which seem ""too"" slick.  Plus, you would have to buy at least 2 of the newer videos to get the same comprehensive workout that is in this video.  The two pound weights started to smell from sweat after the 1st year, so I replaced them with vinyl weights that don't smell after use.  I alternated between the 2 pound weights that came with the video and 3 pound weights I bought separately and also held these weights throughout the first 4 mile segments to increase intensity.  While this is an older video, it is excellent and I have given it as a gift to others who loved it as well.  This video is hard to find but well worth hunting for.",1474761600,,1304,4.2682926829268295

8227618,2,B000XA6RUE,"Book was in great condition.  BUT, there was writing inside first page
from the previous owner. Apparently they gave it as a gift and addressed
it to the receiver. That really was lousy considering I bought as
a gift for a friend",1381017600,,229,4.4523809523809526
8227619,4,B000XA6RUE,Love the Leslie Sansone videos especially the 5 mile walks! I need the exercise and this is a great way for me to get it. I was disappointed that the hand weights didn't come with the video as that is one of the reasons that I ordered it. But it is a great workout any way.,1371945600,2,273,3.892857142857143
8227620,5,B000XA6RUE,I'm been walking with Leslie for about three years now and I was glad to get the five mile video. It is more challenging and gives you a good workout.,1361577600,,150,4.033333333333333
