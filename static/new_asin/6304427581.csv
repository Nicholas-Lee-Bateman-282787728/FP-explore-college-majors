The Monkees not only gave us fun, catchy tunes but they appeared on a funny tv show that was too short-lived.

If you're a Monkees fan, I recommend these videos.",1220227200,,394,4.157894736842105
7870994,4,6304427581,"Dance, Monkee, Dance is one of the better episodes of the show.
Peter is suckered into joining an expensive dance school, Reynaldo's Dance A Go Go, and before long Mike and Micky are swept into joining.  Davy gets in by  posing as a teacher (and to ""I'll Get Back Upon My Feet"" the boys  dance), but there seems to be no way out.  They need a brilliant idea, so  Micky goes to talk to ""The Writers"" off the set, and they give  him an idea that he soon decides isn't worth it.
So the boys do all they  can to sabotage Reynaldo, all to the tune of ""I'm A Believer,""  until he relents and tears up all the lifetime contracts he's ever had  signed.",925430400,9,644,4.129032258064516
