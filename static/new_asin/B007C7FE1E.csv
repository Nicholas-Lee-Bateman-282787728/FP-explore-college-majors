8514250,5,B007C7FE1E,"I couldn't agree more with Mr. Giles' review.

While this is a concert with focus and intensity, the music is peaceful and absolutely gorgeous.  Paavo Jrvi is a pleasure to watch interacting with the musicians and soloists.

The audience is not obtrusive in any way, and each piece is followed by a respectful (but by no means excessive) length of silence.  I recognize that I will always want more!  The Blu-ray menu has background music (from the Pavane), although I didn't find it jarring in any way ...even if it is allowed to sit on repeat (kind of like Bolero!).

I have no hesitation in recommending this wholeheartedly.  I have re-listened to the disc many times since purchasing, yet it continues to haunt and call to me!",1434067200,,730,4.700787401574803

8514252,5,B007C7FE1E,"This all Faure concert disc by the Paris Orchestra and Chorus, nimbly conducted by Paavo Jarvi, is not perfect. For one, the audio though very clear is not the surround mix you might have expected given the DTS 5.1 labeling ....hardly any ambient signals from the rear speakers. Secondly, though for the most part the video quality is very good, it is not the pop up razor sharp image you'd expect from the best blu ray discs....some long shots of the choir at the back of the stage seem underexposed and soft and a curious shimmer sometimes mar the image causing for instance blacks to appear grayish and margins to lose their sharpness. But when the music starts all these seem trivial .
The  'Pavane' for orchestra and chorus is tender with its familiar haunting flute obligato, Jarvi highlighting the delicate interplay between the orchestra and the voices, and showing the flowing melodic lines that is simply Gabriel Faure. Picard next plays the Elegie for cello and orchestra and enraptures one with the expressiveness of its sweet nostalgic themes. Of the next two choral pieces, I liked the youthful and enchanting Cantique de Jean Racine more than the Babylonis psalm. Then comes the main event which is of course the Requiem and what a sublime work this is. Not showy, not massive like other Requiems, but graceful, bitter sweet, introspective and spiritual. The ever popular Pie Jesu is sung in all its crystalline splendor by Chen Reiss , a soprano voice of controlled strength and purity. Again Jarvi brings out the delicate melodic lines interspersed with passages of great intensity and succeeds in imposing on the listener an almost unbearable feeling of yearning  and sadness. If beautiful music can make you cry,this one will.",1348704000,6,1745,4.931972789115647
8514253,5,B007C7FE1E,"This is a very lovely disc indeed, featuring several of Faure's best known and loved choral works and including a couple of surprises chosen from early to mature works. All are given affectionate performances.

The first piece brings the first surprise - the choral version of the famous Pavane. This is generally played in its original orchestral mode of 1887. What many may not be aware of is that Faur made a version in 1891 including chorus, mime and dancing for a private party and it is that choral version we hear on this disc. This alternative setting completely changes the nature of the piece but it is nevertheless an effective transformation.

The only purely orchestral piece of the concert follows - the Elgie for cello and orchestra and this is given an attractive performance by Eric Picard who emphasises its apparent lyrical simplicity.

The remaining three pieces are from opposite ends of Faure's career. The early setting of a psalm concerning events in Babylon includes words which may more normally be associated with part of Walton's Belshazzar's Feast. Needless to say that is where the similarity ends! This premier recording of the work shows that, even as a student, Faur had already gone a long way to achieving his particular sound world. This is even more apparent in the following `Cantique de Jean Racine' which, although still an early work, is remarkably similar to the sound world of the Requiem written some 35 years later.

The Requiem itself is given in the full orchestral version instead of the frequently performed chamber orchestra version. Here Jarvi keeps the textures clear and avoids any thickening of textures so often a problem with this fuller version. The two soloists are completely up to the task, especially the soprano, Chen Reiss.

There is a fascinating 13 minute bonus during which Jarvi explains his thinking as regards the Requiem especially. He goes on to give details about himself as a musician, the orchestras he has worked with and their special characteristics and finally, the subject of making visual recordings such as this.

This is a disc of sublime music which receives sublime performances by totally sympathetic musicians. The recording quality offers faultless imaging and camera work and is presented in high quality DTS-HD and stereo sound. One cannot really ask for more and a 5 star rating seems only just. This disc should give much pleasure and satisfaction to future purchasers.",1341619200,6,2460,5.031941031941032
