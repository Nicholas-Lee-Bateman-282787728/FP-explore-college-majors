1899610,5,B0000A02YE,"Long overdue, but finally here.....  The Last Shout is on dvd.  Hopefully both 1 & 2 are shown in their entirety?!  I just wish at some point Jennifer would have secured the rights to put that wonderful episode of them when they appeared on ROSANNE, when Patsy finally discusses her past as a male. That episode would have fit in so well with these new dvd releases.  How fun, all three dvd's are being released on the same day!: ""Special"", ""French & Saunders: The Ingenue Years"", and ""French & Saunders: Living In A Material World"".  Jennifer Saunders is a genius. :)",1058659200,3,568,4.584158415841584
1899611,5,B0000A02YE,"First, know this...No one has seen the DVD yet because it has not been released yet. Secondly, the press release in the U.K. stated that there will be commentary from Jon Plowman AND Jennifer Saunders. Note that Jon Plowman is the Executive Producer of this episode and Tristan Shapeero is the Director. At any cost, this is a fantastic special to own if you are a Ab Fab fan. Whoopie Goldberg is halarious in this and Serge is finally seen and Eddie and Patsy tie the knot. What is best to look forward to is Season five already being filmed. 8 episodes, the first 5 have been taped already, ""Cleanin'"", ""Book Clubin'"", ""Birthin'"", ""Drinkin""' and ""Panic"". Saffy gives birth in the third ep. Enjoy!!!!",1057708800,9,701,4.661290322580645
1899612,5,B0000A02YE,"The girls from Ab fab are back!!! A new DVD containing the two Ab Fab movies sweetie...The New York Special and The Last Shout, with audio commentary and outtakes!!!
The New York Special entitle ""GAY""- Jennifer Saunders, in an homage to her gay fans, has brought Serge out of the closet and created a one-hour special around his reunion with his ridiculous mum, Edina Monsoon. Not only do we get to see Debbie Harry of Blondie perform the AbFab theme ""This Wheels on Fire"", Edie and Patsy get married by Whoopi Goldberg, we get to visit fashion week, location shots at many familiar gay landmarks in NYC and cameos by many gay icons. Also includes the rest of the ab fab gang, Buddle, Saffy, and grams
In ""The last Shout"" we see Edina floating with a dolphin in a pool located in her bedroom for spiritual cleansing. She contacts Patsy, who has been renting an apartment conveniently located above a liquor store, to get ready for her job interview. Patsy does get up, but only so far as to walk into a pub. And guess what...Saffy has a boy friends. Will she Marry him, and will Edina aprove of him?
A must buy for any ab fab fan",1055548800,16,1129,4.4326923076923075

1899753,5,B0000A02YE,"This DVD set features two specials that ""Absolutely Fabulous"" produced, the first being ""Absolutely Fabulous in New York"" (also known as ""Gay"") and the special entitled ""The Last Shout"" that originally ended the series back in 1996. In the first special Edina and Patsy fly to New York to visit Edina's son Serge who is gay. She is very unhappy, not because of her son's sexuality, but because in her mind he isn't gay enough! In ""The Last Shout"" (which was originally a two part episode) Saffy finds herself engaged to a millionaire hunk. The only other ""Ab Fab"" special the girls did was called ""White Box"" and it is not included on this collection, but in a separate DVD as well as on the ""Absolutely Fabulous"" boxset called ""Absolutely Everything"".

1899756,5,B0000A02YE,"I bought collection for my girlfriend.
She loves it, as does her niece (who borrowed it and has not given it back yet ... lol).
I used to watch the series on public broadcasting. It's no Faulty Towers but it's one of the funnier English comedies.",1220054400,,246,4.369565217391305
1899757,3,B0000A02YE,"I've been a huge ""Absolutely Fabulous"" fan since Comedy Central started airing in my area and luckily, at the time, ""Ab Fab"" still in it's first run here in the states.  Back then, it was very fun to watch ""Ab Fab"" because while it had frequent commercial breaks, they were also very short, sometimes often running only one ad!  That changed quickly.

Anyway, easily the first three seasons/""series"" of the show where the peak and everything else kind of pails in comparison, where slightly or greatly.  In the case of ""Absolutley Fabulous: Absolutely Special"", the distance each of the two specials has from those episodes affects their greatness.

""The Last Shout"" was meant to be that but it has no real satisfying ending.  It came rather shortly after ""Series 3"", which seemed to wrap up loose ends with a funny ending that shows a possible future.  In
""The Last Shout"",  the main stories have Edina and Patsy vacationing in a ski resort town in order to mingle with celebrities (the celebs aren't there, for whatever reason) while Saffy meets the possible man of her dreams.  Eddie and Patsy pack in the laughs (Eddie is wackier than ever with 60s music scenes that pop up anytime she is stressed while Patsy struggles to perform the simplest function by attending a meeting and saying one brief statement on pants).  The gags, side stories and behavior bring in the laughs even if the dominating Saffy storyline (which runs through two parts while the ski trip is only in the first) gets to be sort of annoying.  The overbearing Paolo is impossibly snarky and it almost gets to be a little bit dark even for Ab Fab (remember the way Patsy treated Saffy....this feels much worse and more serious).  Still, overall while the ""movie""/special (divided into two large episodes) would rank low among seasons one through three episodes, those episodes were so strong that it's still really good.  I personally loved it.  A great cameo here is made by Marianne Faithful who plays God (Marcella Detroit, a white soul singer, plays an angel who plays guitar and sings background on a stellar version of ""We Got To Get Out of This Place"" with the ageless Faithful).

Not working so well is ""In New York"" (the US title for this shorter special called ""Gay"" in the UK). It feels out of place in the ""Ab Fab"" catalog, even though it's the follow up to the 2002 ""Series 4"", which was kind of a modestly entertaining return (and that's being very kind).  What happened here?  What is this?  We finally get a chance to meet the often discussed Serge, Eddie's much loved but never seen son, but the build up leads to a major letdown not because he turns out to be lame but because we expected so much more with his return but there is no payoff in laughs (it doesn't work as drama, which I think it tries to be, either).  The story starts with Patsy going to New York (and begging apparently jobless Eddie to come) for a big fashion fiasco with a lot of designers presenting new things but of course the trip for Eddie becomes about finding the son she finally discovers has been living in New York for years while Saffy and Marshall made excuses for him.  It is a return to New York for the two and for my money, when they visited New York during the first run (not sure what season/series), which was basically a trip to take a picture of a door handle Eddie wanted for her kitchen, it was one of the funniest episodes ever!  Here, there just isn't much to do, even if they are in the middle of a fashion frenzy.  Two main stories but no payoff for either!  The chemistry between Patsy and Eddie seems to be lost and so are the ideas.  There are laughs (not as frequent and not as hard), but the story is awful.  I have no idea what the Saffy ""bit"" is with her hiding in a cupboard and watching people.  She's not even a character we root for anymore even a little like we used to becuase the tension isn't there.  Saffy is slightly happy that Eddie might find Serge and smother him in order to let her go, but does Eddie even care about having Saffy there in the house anymore.  That's very unclear.  This kind of shows a dead end for Saffy, if not the series.  And everything is very predictable and stale.  Yes, Eddie's son is gay and that's always been her dream.  But he works in a bookshop (I did like her being ""allergic"" to books) and for some reason Serge has a boyfriend who is the stereotype his mother always wanted but he never wanted to be (the boyfriend is not predictable, but just plain not logical).  Whoopi Goldberg makes a lame cameo as LBGT (although she can't even get the title right) counselor who makes her really money presiding over gay marriages.  She basically stumbles through this part and it's very disappointing for somebody so talented.  Debbie Harry makes a cameo for literally a second (the soundtrack seems to be made up of obscure Blondie tracks, probably because it's set in New York) AND it's a waste as Eddie basically pushes Serge up to say ""Debbie, meet your God son"" while she is singing (she seems surprised and doesn't say a word).  Debbie is an actual actress, too...she was probably capable of doing a good scene or two much the same way Faithful did in the prior special.  ""In New York"" is ""Ab Fab"" as it's laziest.  I can't imagine Jennifer Saunders (or Joanna Lumley's) heart is in this.  I recently went back and watched some episodes of ""Series 5"" and both the special and the series suffer from an unnecessary and baffling focus on secondary characters (but especially giving Marshall and Bo skits).  In this special, for some reason, now uber-Christian Bo tries to push Marshall into a homosexual date because he said something about everyone having gay feelings...it's the type of painful time filler that ends up being repeated when the show comes back.  ""Ab Fab"" is Eddie, Patsy, Saffy and sometimes Grandma with a good quip or two.  It doesn't need much.  The episode where the three characters are trapped in a room is one of the best!  ""In New York"" was the step in the wrong direction for ""Ab Fab"" that lead the series astray.  I kind of want to give Jennifer the benefit of the doubt here and think that maybe it was shortened for time and could have had a fuller more developed (more logical) story.  ""Ab Fab"" is ab absurd comedy but it never forced it's viewers to make stretches like this.  Remember how well paced the series last two episodes in ""Series 3"" where?  This is the total opposite.  While not much happens, for some reason after Eddie meets Serge, it's all rushed nonsense and excuses for mayhem with an eye rolling ending that thankfully did not effect even the weak ""Series 5"".

I have ""The Last Shout"" (which maybe should have been the last shout) on VHS and I think that's the way it's going to stay.  No need to get this just for ""In New York"" (also as noted, the video version actually has Marianne singing ""Wheel's On Fire"" in the title credits).  The fact that ""Absolutely Specials"" cost nearly as much as the stand alone early series is kind of crazy.  You are much better off with any one of those.  And if you still got a VCR, you can find ""The Last Shout"" on tape for nearly nothing used.  You're much better off.  For completest only.",1190937600,,7215,4.51617873651772
1899758,2,B0000A02YE,"First off, let me say that I LOVE AbFab. But, this isn't the best of it. 'The Last Shout' is the better of the two, I think, but neither really finds the old timing and freshness.

'In New York' was completely disappointing (except for the segment where Whoopi Goldberg ""Marries"" Edina and Patsy: one has the sense that THAT scene was inevitable.) Meeting Serge was a letdown. In the commentary on Season 4 for the program about Saffy writing a play about her life, Jennifer Saunders said we would never see the real Serge. I think she was right in that thought - and should not have produced him in this program. Of course, he turned out to be gay, and the exact opposite of his crazy mother. Saffron is Edina's opposite as well, but at least she gives as well as she gets. Serge, on the other hand, looked vulnerable, and didn't seem to have the self-esteem to stand his ground. Showing Serge wasn't funny and didn't advance the series. Probably should not have been done.

The best part of 'The Last Shout' was having Marianne Faithfull play God (a role she reprises in Season 4). Most of the rest of it seemed forced.

Sorry. I really wanted to like these programs more than I did.",1188864000,,1185,4.451612903225806

1899785,5,B0000A02YE,"This DVD comprises the 2 ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS 'specials', ""The Last Shout"" and ""Gay"".

""The Last Shout"" - In the AB-FAB timeline, this special takes place after Series 3, when Jennifer Saunders was adamant that this was to be be last-ever AB-FAB story. Eddy and Patsy take a trip to the snowfields of Val de Ser, leaving Saffy at home with her stuffy new boyfriend Paolo Carlo.

During their event-filled holiday, Eddy (Jennifer Saunders) becomes convinced that she is Christ returned after having a near-death experience on a mountaintop where she visited God (Marianne Faithful). Patsy (Joanna Lumley) is evicted from her flat above the Oddbins in the Kings Road, and Mother (June Whitfield) has shacked up with some old friends in a grotty caravan.

Saffy (Julia Sawalha) and Paolo decide to get married, leaving Eddy to plan the wedding of the century...

""Gay"" - In the AB-FAB timeline this story takes place after Series 4. Eddy discovers that her absent son Serge is gay and living in New York. Since she and Patsy are in town during Fashion Week anyway, she decides to seek him out. With the help of Goldie (Whoopi Goldberg), a lesbian marriage celebrant, Eddy and Serge are reunited...but for how long?

AB-FAB fans will relish adding these stories to their collections.",1132963200,10,1278,4.925581395348837
1899786,4,B0000A02YE,"ABFAB as some of us fans call it is quite possibly one of the zaniest, craziest, sickest shows to come out of Britain to date. The premise is simple. There's Edwina (Eddie), her friend Patsy and Eddie's daughter Saffron (Saffi). Eddie is an overweight, immature, compulsive, undersexed, selfish, fashion misfit who worships LaCroix and everything he designs. Patsy is a drunken, non-working, oversexed, chain smoking, spend thrift, fashionista, self-centered, alcoholic, leach. She's also Eddie's best friend. Saffi is the plain jane, level headed, smart, prudish, straight laced dauther of Eddie and her father who happens to be gay has left her mother for a gay black man.

Poor Saffi even though the child of the house more often than not has to be the adult of the house. She fixes her mom breakfast when she comes in from a hard night of boozing and partying with Patsy. Patsy and Saffi hate each other and continually snipe at each other.

Aside from storylines, ABFAB is very difficult to describe because many of the funniest bits are visual. You have to see and hear everything. One funny episode has Saffi off to college for the first time. Eddie tries to guilt her into staying home but it doesn't work. That morning Eddie drives to the college and barges her way into Saffi's class with a can of something and a can opener and asks Saffi to open the can for her because she doesn't know how to work the can opener. Madness. It's very funny.

You should watch all of the episodes because there's not a bit of sanity in any of them. You've got to have this!

Not suitable for young children though. It's barely suitable for grown ups!",1132185600,,1644,4.697916666666667
1899787,5,B0000A02YE,"Special edition episodes of Ab Fab DVD containing ""The Last Shout"", and ""In New York"".

""The Last Shout"" is my favorite Ab Fab episode. I love the breezy, sunny, renewed expression of the opening shots, with light commercial music filling the air, playing on radios in at least three seperate locations, that never would have sounded as good anywhere else, accompanying a cocaine fueled Patsy preparing for a job interview, a vacation planning Edina listening to upbeat, watered down hit music in therapeutic headphones, (she listens to ""Good Morning, Starshine"", and repeats phrases aloud like, ""think happy thoughts.""), and a starry-eyed Safron about to accept a marriage proposal. Reality busts through this complacency as Edina is devestated by news of her daughter's marriage, Patsy would rather party than work, and Safron falls victim to her fiance's patriarchal ways. It's a blueprint for some of Ab Fab's funniest moments, spearheaded by the show's unique brand of social relevance and poignant and outlandish humor. It just bubbles over with laughs.

Then there's ""In New York"". The first time I saw this on cable TV, I had to turn it off at the half way point. I always admired Ab Fab's ability to poke bold fun at guilt inducing, socially conscious agendas like eating disorders, substance abuse and disease, and the episode's immediate reference to 9-11, (Edina calls it 7-11, or is it 24-7?), is like relief from our stilted hushed post 9-11 atmosphere. But after a remarkably unfunny second half concerning Edina's attempt to locate her gay son in New York City, the program concludes with a bizarre finale as a New York bar explodes, causing burnt and charred people to spill out into the street, in a heavy reference to 9-11 that is simply disturbing. It's as if there is an inside word here, an attempt to lay blame and guilt on the causes of 9-11, that escapes me entirely. The final NYC shots of a smoke blackened Edina and Patsy being arrested while sirens wail and a building burns, as her son places a cell phone call and his lover shouts, ""Do something!"" seems an unhinged reference to the tragedy.

But as the character Bo would say, anyhoo. Jennifer Saunders is remarkable. I'm amazed by her ability to singularly write these scripts brimming with keen absorbed observations. Often looking gawky and ill-kept as Edina, she looks particularly radiant and beautiful upon reuniting with her son and feebly attempting to accept him as a 'book' worm in ""In New York"". Mo Gaffney, as Bo has some of her best Ab Fab moments in both episodes, especially her paranoid escape from the scary Christian Scientists in ""Ths Last Shout"", and her subsequent drunken Christian rants of her days in the ministry; ""...for the life of me, I could not remember the names of the four disciples, but I could remember every Osmond (brother)..."".

I received a very kind letter from Jon Plowman, executive producer of Ab Fab, with my last Amazon review of an Ab Fab DVD, and with all due respect, I'd like to remind producers of these packages that, at least here in America, we buy televsion series DVDs to insure an uncensored, unedited show. I hate reading in the credits that Marianne Faithful sings the title song, ""Wheels On Fire"", when there is no such vocal on the disc. Also, the blank space where the missing song, ""The First Cut Is The Deepest"" once was in ""The Last Shout"", is an insult to my regard for the program as a cultural icon. And, while it may be fast becoming the norm, I hate having to sit through, or fast foreword through, several minutes of BBC program promos every time I put the disc in.

But I'll take Ab Fab any way I can get it.",1127260800,8,3661,4.75
1899788,4,B0000A02YE,"Okay, first: the people who have complained about the actual DVD transfer have every right to be disappointed. ""Gay"" should be widescreen, but is not on this disc. The theme songs for both specials are removed. And, worst of all, the box takes the special name ""Gay"" and redubs it ""In New York."" Insulting. So there's that out of the way.

As everyone else has said, ""The Last Shout"" is great. It's nice to actually have this available in Region 1. Pretty much everything works in ""The Last Shout,"" even if the ending falls a bit flat.

I'd also like to say, though, that ""Gay"" is good as well. A lot of people (using phrases like ""recycled vomit"") have said otherwise. They say it's just jumping on the gay-TV bandwagon for easy laughs and ""fabulous"" atmosphere. And this is how it appears... until Eddy actually meets her son (spoiler alert). The real gag is that Serge, despite the gay stereotype, is possibly more boring than ""dull-as-dishwater"" Saffy. So Eddy's larger-than-life world view once again seems completely silly when compared with the pragmatism of her child... it's just the other one, this time.

No, ""Gay"" isn't as good as ""The Last Shout,"" but it's not bad. I'd say it's better than most of Series 4, which, in my opinion, was the most inconsistent. Then again, it's not up to the superb quality of Series 5, either.",1105315200,4,1337,4.680851063829787
1899789,3,B0000A02YE,"Absolutely Fabulous: The Last Shout is wonderful.

Absolutely Fabulous In New York is not.

So (and this is just a guess) marketing titans at BBC America, realising the depth of inferiority of the latter, have cut & pasted it onto a DVD mini-collection with the former, in the hopes that having-to-buy-one-with-the-other will see some sort of a return on the high-budget high-celebrity low-humour ""New York"" episode.

I'll handle each section separately.

""The Last Shout"" sees Eddy and Patsy off on another holiday, this time to Val D'esere, to ski and to escape Saffy's bombshell - she's getting married. Sick of ""bearing the burden of the Passive Destiny"", militant feminist Saff has decided to bow to peer pressure and accept her well-to-do society boyfriend Paolo's offer of marriage, and Eddy, upon realising his social standing, employs a sneaky Patsy and all the PR connections and money at her disposal to give her a wedding she'll never forget.

Along the way she learns to snowboard, meets God (a wonderfully perfect Marianne Faithfull), and finally comes face-to-face with another God - or is it Lacroix, sweetie?

The brilliance of ""The Last Shout"" is in the simplicity. It's not choc-full of celebrity cameos, nor does it rely on the glamorous locations and jet-set lifestyle for laughs. Saunders' script crackles and sparkles with the good old Ab-Fab brand of upper-class vulgarity and excessive sang-froid, and in places, is the best work she's ever done. Patsy meeting Paolo's Mother still makes me laugh out loud even now, and Eddy's scenes on the hunt for a church and a Lacroix frock for her daughter's big day have lost none of their comic value.

Performances are fantastic; Saunders and Lumley are far, far better here than in the disjointed Series 3, and we get to see a rare, 'girly' side to Saffron that Julia Sawalha must have relished playing.

All in all, ""Last Shout"" is a classic, timeless moment of Ab-Fabbery, and one that no fan should do without.

And now the bad news.

Do we remember in the episode ""New Year"" (Series 3), Eddy saying to Oliver ""If you'd said that when you arrived I might've been impressed.""? Well, that (excellent) line sort of sums up the ""New York"" special. Gay isn't a big deal anymore. Neither is Celebrity. So when you take 2 characters who hav kept their collective fingers nailed to the Zeitgeisty Pulse for the last 12 years and put them in a situation full of redundant ideas (the coolness of being Gay, the madcap and superficial world of the Celeb), then you have a recipie for disaster. Six or seven years ago this would have been cool, but now it's sadly lost in the stagnant mire of bilge-programming like ""Queer Eye"" and ""American Idol"".

Eddy finally discovers Serge's whereabouts, as well as his sexuality, and, thanks to a well-timed trip of Patsy's, decides to go to New york to see him and let him know she loves the fact that he's gay.

What we have here is a hodge-podge of redundant jokes (Bo's Tammy-Faye Baker drag is particularly annoying, Bubble seems pointless and Saffy's ote-taking is TOTALLY out of character), awkward celebrity cameos (Wooden Graham Norton, plainly unfunny Whoopi Goldberg) and a script that is as tired and maudlin as the storyline behind it. Laughs are few and far between: Patsy is now more a charicature of her former glorious self, and Eddy has become mere narrative for the antics of the rest of the crew.

The final reunion between Eddy & Serge is a wasted potential, and, much like the rest of the episode, is a few weak jokes mired in a sea of celebrities like Debbie Harry and predictable situations like Patsy fire-dancing.

A big disappointment, the nicest thing I can say about ""New York"" is that it's bundled here in the same collection as ""The Last Shout"".

Extras are poor, outtakes are run-of-the-mill fare, and audio/video quality is average.

Only to be considered for ""The Last Shout"" (which, thankfully, is twice as long as ""New York""), this collection really is a very mixed bag of laughs and snores.

One for the fans.",1091750400,4,4045,4.822254335260116

1899791,5,B0000A02YE,"This DVD comprises the 2 ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS 'specials', ""The Last Shout"" and ""Gay"".
""The Last Shout"" - In the AB-FAB timeline, this special takes place after Series 3, when Jennifer Saunders was adamant that this was to be be last-ever AB-FAB story.  Eddy and Patsy take a trip to the snowfields of Val de Ser, leaving Saffy at home with her stuffy new boyfriend Paolo Carlo.
During their event-filled holiday, Eddy becomes convinced that she is Christ returned after having a near-death experience on a mountaintop where she visited God (Marianne Faithful).  Patsy is evicted from her flat above the Oddbins in the Kings Road, and Mother has shacked up with some old friends in a grotty caravan.
Saffy and Paolo decide to get married, leaving Eddy to plan the wedding of the century...
""Gay"" - In the AB-FAB timeline this story takes place after Series 4.  Eddy discovers that her absent son Serge is gay and living in New York.  Since she and Patsy are in town during Fashion Week anyway, she decides to seek him out.  With the help of Goldie (Whoopi Goldberg), a lesbian marriage celebrant, Eddy and Serge are reunited...but for how long?
AB-FAB fans will relish adding these stories to their collections.  Always a fantastic show!",1082073600,50,1235,4.829383886255924
1899792,3,B0000A02YE,"I'm sad to say that ""Gay"" is just recycled jokes from previous Ab Fabs. With that said, it's still better than anything on American television. I just hold Jennifer Sauders on a higher level and when she starts to recycle the same lines it's time to let the series go. I've got my fingers, toes, and everything else crossed in hopes that she can bring back the ""Fabulous"" wit that we all look forward to.
For all you Ab Fab fans out there, don't buy the DVD. Just rent it from Netflix and keep it for a long week so you can watch it a few times. Unfortunately it's not a keeper.",1077580800,4,578,4.169642857142857
1899793,5,B0000A02YE,"Ignore the negative reviews, my boyfriend and I are diehard fans with all the tapes and dvds there are to have of this series and we loved it.  The Last Shout is priceless and In New York continues the quality of humour we have come to expect from this great series.  Worth every penny.",1073606400,5,286,4.277777777777778
1899794,5,B0000A02YE,"Both of these specials are fantastic.  I watch ABFAB all the time, it never gets old.  When I first saw ""Gay,"" I didn't think it was as great as the original episodes, but there are some very funny parts in it.  I think Whoopi is perfect in her part and I always crack up when Eddy and Pats are in the office with her.  The clubbing at the end is great.  And, the part where Pats is reading the designers' names in the hotel room... Timmy Holefinger, Ellis, D...KNY (LSD).  She's just clever in her own little way.  I think some of these things only come out after watching the episodes 5 or 500 times.  Anyhow, I will buy everything Saunders ever makes because she is a creative genius.",1073520000,2,687,4.271317829457364
1899795,1,B0000A02YE,"There are 2 problems with this disc. First, the commentary by Jennifer Saunders that was promised is missing, and second, ""Gay"" is presented in cropped format instead of the original widescreen as broadcast in the UK. This is stupid, as Season 4 was correctly released in widescreen, so why isn't this follow-up? If you want to see the entire picture, import the Uk disc which also includes the commentary. ""The Last Shout"" is fine as it was filmed before widescreen TV took over in the UK. Avoid the US DVD and get the UK one if you have a region free player.",1073260800,6,560,4.5
1899796,2,B0000A02YE,"The New York special ""Gay"" is extremely weak.  What makes it worse than just mediocre is the use of Whoopi Goldberg... the queen of unfunny comedians.  Who let her into this special?  They ought to be fired twice.
It was Ab Fab in search of actual gags... horrible.  Most everything flopped.  Like at least one reviewer mentioned, Mo Gaffney is actually funny in this special (which is a pleasant surprise).  Of course, Jane Horrocks as Bubble is fairly good, and she's just as good in her other appearance. ;)
To be fair, most people are going to get this for ""The Last Shout""... and that's worth the price BBC/WB asks for, but it's still not as good as the good old days.  Perhaps it's on par with series 4.
Buy it if you must, but shake your fist in complaint because ""In New York/Gay"" is some of the worst drivel produced for television.",1069200000,7,841,4.457516339869281
1899797,3,B0000A02YE,"I am an AbFab fanatic.  I wanted to see the episode where Edina finds Serge - especially after Jennifer Saunders said in the commentary on the Series 4 DVD that they never would do Serge because there was too much build up.  I didn't care if it sucked.  Seeing it was a need.
If you feel the way I did, then you should buy this DVD.  I definitely don't regret buying.  I don't plan on trying to sell it off.  I might even be very reluctant to loan it to a friend.  It is precious to me.
That being said, I gave this DVD 3 stars because only a fanatic would shell out money to buy it.  There isn't a whole lot of extra stuff, and it's obvious that it's supposed to be shown in wide screen format.  I don't know why they couldn't have done the little black bars thing, but whatever.  You pay whatever you pay for it because you want to see Eddy find Serge.  There's a brief section of outakes from AbFab in NYC after the outakes from the Last Shout, but it seems like a last minute addition and leaves you wanting much much more.",1068163200,2,1027,4.085
1899798,5,B0000A02YE,"I was so happy to learn that The Last Shout was getting a DVD release. I purchased the VHS version several years ago and practically wore the tape out. The entire show is non stop funny! The interactions between Patsy & Edina are in top form, especially when they are in the car discussing Saffy. Edina: ""I don't think they've ever done it you know"" Patsy: ""Darling, she is a virgin in a world where men will even turn to soft fruit for pleasure."" The second feature, Gay, is not up to par however. Eddie learns her son Serge is gay & living in NYC. You think it would be fun, but the only real laughs coem at the end when they all go bar hopping.",1067126400,,647,4.142857142857143
1899799,4,B0000A02YE,"Overall, this is still sublime comedy, but compared with other AbFab packages, this is at the bottom of the barrel.
Although I miss the commentary and letterboxing of Series 4, my biggest complaint is the lack of theme song.  One of the best things about ""The Last Shout"" is the theme-song version of ""This Wheel's on Fire"" sung by guest star Marianne Faithful.  Apparently, Warner is too cheap to pony up for the song rights for the DVD, so that version (along with the regular version on ""In New York"" a.k.a. ""Gay"") has been excised.  If you want to hear it, you can try to get ahold of a copy of the out-of-print VHS version of ""The Last Shout.""
Let's face it - in relation to the regular ""series"" episodes, these ""specials"" are not quite up to par.  ""The Last Shout"" was intended to be the series finale and/or a botched AbFab movie. While Part 1 of ""Last Shout"" rivals the early-series travel episodes for its French skiing adventures, ""Part 2"" is predictable melodrama - did anyone really believe Saffy would tie the knot with a character we'd never seen before?
As for ""In New York,"" this is perhaps the weakest of any AbFab production, down there with the awkward guest episode in ""Roseanne""'s disastrous final season.  This episode is actually titled ""Gay,"" but for whatever marketing reason, is called ""In New York,"" on this DVD.  It is a shameless shout-out to AbFab's gay fans, but also a completely clumsy and dishonest stunt.  First of all, Serge wasn't meant to be gay - in an early episode, Eddie, Pats, and Saffy discovered a stack of heterosexual adult magazines in Serge's American-Football-themed old bedroom (one issue featuring a young Patsy baring all).  Secondly, once Eddie and Patsy arrive in New York, this episode dissovles into comedic purgatory, with Whoopi Goldberg (!) poorly playing a PFLAG-like counselor and the ladies engaging in an unwitting gay wedding.  It's not funny or genuine to the characters or to the audience.  I doubt the gay community was hollering for an awknowledgement as unfunny and forced as this.
That being said, we are still talking about one of the best, most original comedies created in the last quarter century. Here's to hoping Series 5 will get the show back on track (although the idea of Saffy giving birth isn't sounding so promising, either).",1066521600,40,2309,4.793450881612091
1899800,3,B0000A02YE,"Of course I would have bought it even if it had a white cover and no ""extras"" but when I opened the dvd case and there was not even an inner sleeve I was so disappointed. I love the inner sleeves and I thought that for 20 bucks a pop they could have at least given us an inner sleeve detailing what we would find on the disc. Other than that the episodes are great and Im so glad to finally have them on DVD. Hopefully they'll do a better job when releasing the forthcoming season in the future. We can keep our fingers crossed, can't we?",1065484800,5,538,4.037383177570093
1899801,4,B0000A02YE,"Six years span the two 'special' episodes that are included on this Fab disc and they're finally here and almost worth the wait.
The material is hilarious, as usual, and the out-takes...most of which are from 'The Last Shout' are not only just out-takes but extended/alternate and deleted scenes.  The out-takes from 'Gay' are relegated to a mere few minutes....Damn!!!
Doesn't matter though...what is here is great.  And a welcome completion to anyones AFBAB dvd collection.  The aspect ratio isn't all that disturbing....as a matter of fact.....coming from someone who has been pro-widescreen since the early days of special VHS letterbox editions of films.....it didn't matter to me at all....but if you need something to be disappointed in....that would be it.
'The Last Shout' is broken down into its proper televised 2 parts...with part 1 running 42:56 and part 2....42:24.  'New York' or 'Gay' clock's in at 54:10. Both 'special' episodes include footage that for some reason failed to make air when BBC America ran them at their debut times.  And, of course, the bleeped language is intact.  You have the option of selecting which episode to view OR running the whole thing.  The out-takes run 13:43.  That's about it...No commentary...No optional language selection.  Bare bones....but anything ABFAB is hardly that!!!
The guests that appear on the 'Gay' episode range from the cute as hell Rufus Wainwright to Whoopi Goldberg.  Graham Norton gives a nod to Patsy's past and Debbie Harry/Blondie does most of the soundtrack culminating with an appearance at a New York club singing ""...if your memory serves you well...""  Hardly singing 'Wheels On Fire' as you may have read in previous reviews.  Josh Hamilton, who if you haven't seen in 'Urbania'...DO!!!, is perfect as 'not-at-all-fabulous' Serge.  The collection is complete...that is until Series 5, YAY!!!!, takes its bow later in the Fall.  If you love ABFAB....you need this disc.  So....go get it......load up your multi-disc player....pour some Boli....and have an Absolutely Fabulous Weekend chock full of laughs!!  Cheers, Sweeties!!!!",1064966400,5,2106,5.298192771084337
