8414748,3,B0043EFAJ0,SO happy to have more access to visual Bible movies. I've never seen an Acts one before so I purchased this. I like it but don't expect super great quality of production.,1364688000,,170,4.34375
8414749,4,B0043EFAJ0,"This DVD was good. I had this same product in VHS form but watching it in the digital format was much better. The dramatization of the movie was great. Dean Jones does a good job of telling the story. In the opening scene, I think, the director wanted to show Luke (Dean Jones) as a physician first then later as a companion of Paul as they traveled to many places proclaiming the Gospel. The script sticks closely to the scriptures in the Bible which is the greatest part. What I liked most about it was you can open your Bible to the Book of Acts and follow along as you watch.",1359936000,4,579,4.225225225225225
