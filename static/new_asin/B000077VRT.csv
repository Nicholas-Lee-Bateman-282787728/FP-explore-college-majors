1801731,3,B000077VRT,"Although the 1980 Kubrick classic is far superior to this one in may ways (acting, writing) this version of the novel was written by Stephen King himself, and is faithful to the novel in every way.
The only things that I had a problem with were as follows:
1. Some of the acting is extremely hokey...Courtland Mead was good, but they should have hired an acting coach to help him.
2. Some of the dialogue was laughable...""Kissin', kissin, that's what I been missin'!"" and (Danny speaking of his mother's drawings) ""Draw good fruit!"" - among other things.
Thats about it. Other than that, its a good adaptation of the book, and I enjoyed it. I actually watched this in one sitting-its LONG, clocking in at about four hours and thirty minutes, but its good.
Rent it.",1041811200,,764,4.625
1801732,5,B000077VRT,"Although I think Jack Nicholson is one of the finest actors ever and Kubrick was in the top ten of all directors, the original movie was an insult to the book. This how ever was true to form, by far one of the truest book to movie projects ever done.  I felt that it allowed you to see the true madness that Jack and family were a victim to as well as the power of the hotel with its' gruesome and painful history.  If you read the book, this is truly the movie for you.  Follow the story as Mr King intended it to be and enjoy the ride.",1041638400,5,537,3.908256880733945
1801733,2,B000077VRT,"Stanley Kubricks version of The Shining was 100 times better than this one. I mean lets look at it, Jack Nicholson vs. Stephen Weber, Nicholson who is a very scary man with an extensive filmography, and did and excellent job, or Stephen Weber, best know for his performance on Wings...Wings, one f the worst shows ever. Weber performance in this new version of The Shining was not even terrifying. But Nicholson, who brought chills to my spine, terrified the hearts of millions. Overall rating of The Shining (1997)...

1801734,5,B000077VRT,"After the Stanley Kubric version of ""The Shining"", I doubted that the miniseries would be nearly as good. Jack Nicholson was haunting and comical in the movie, and I didn't believe Steven Weber could even compare (although I thought Weber was a good actor). But, I decided to watch anyway, since I loved the book, and I was curious to see if it would be any good. I absolutely loved this version. It is a magnificent alternative version. In my opinion, it's much better than the movie. The miniseries explores the psychological problems that Jack Torrance endures, the alcohol addiction, and the gradual descent into madness. Plus, Wendy (played excellently by Rebecca De Mornay), was a far superior character than the one in the Kubric film. Wendy in this version is loving, caring, and strong, as opposed to the cigarette-smoking one in the miniseries who is simply a doormat. Danny is also a great character, showing what the child is really thinking and going through while he sadly watches his parents struggle and argue. The hotel is beautiful, but inside, the deadly evil awaits. The bath scene was haunting, and much more realistic than the one in the film. All in all, this miniseries made much more sense than the movie, although I still love the movie anyway. I wouldn't say that Jack using a roque malet is cooler than in the movie using an axe, but it's still almost just as scary. The miniseries is true to the book. Almost all the important scenes of the book are present in this version. It is really scary. A true horror. The ending is very sad, but it's also a sensible conclusion. I definately recommend this version for horror and psychological thriller fans! (However, It's ashame they didn't include the part with ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"", or ""Heeeeeeere's Johnny!"")",1041292800,6,1808,4.761146496815287
1801735,5,B000077VRT,"I read the Stephen King book when I was 14, and I loved it.  Then I saw the Stanley Kubrick film, and it was godawful.  Many key parts of the plot were deleted, while other stuff was just added for the hell of it.  For instance, Kubrick took out the scene with the hedge animals and the wasp nest, and while those weren't crucial to the plot, it was nice to see them in the miniseries.  Kubrick also added ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" which is a classic line.  Too bad it wasn't in the book.  Overall, if you read the book, you should have been waiting for years to see a version of The Shining as faithful as this one.  This is the best miniseries I've ever seen.",1039219200,39,680,4.029850746268656
1801736,4,B000077VRT,"The Good Things:
*Storyline is substantially closer to the original novel.  Contains many things that the older film (the Kubrick version) left out.
*Characters are fairly well-developed, and have greater backgrounds.
*Writing is good; some of it is from the book, some of it is original.
*Stephen King has a cameo.

The Bad Things:
*Very long.
*Some dialogue is a little cheesy (in true Stephen King fashion!).
*Some special effects are cheesy too (like the moving hedge animals, which are cool, but are not menacing).

Unlike the Stanley Kubrick version, this rendition of the ""Shining"" is not overwhelmingly stylish or visceral.  Instead, this miniseries focuses more on developing the story and characters in a realistic way.  This also means presenting the anomalies in the Overlook Hotel as actual supernatural presences, instead of simply showing the father going crazy.  Overall, this is a good adaptation of the book with good characters and plot, but not with the scary, intense style of Kubrick.

Incidentally, I think the perfect adaptation of the ""Shining"" should have this story combined with Kubrick's style.",1037923200,3,1123,5.275280898876405
1801737,5,B000077VRT,"I have been waiting for this one.  This mini-series is, by far, the best of the King epics.  A great story woven around very interesting, and very human, characters.  Slick Steven Webber proves to be much more than just cocky Brian Hackett from Wings, and really delivers the goods.  Whereas Nicholson was crazy from the get go (King's major objection to the Kubrick film version), Webber's incarnation of Jack Torrance runs the gambit of human emotions throughout.  Even in the depths of his psychosis, he is is a tragically compassionate figure, fighting evil and himself as best he can.  Also, the Overlook hotel never looked better.  This mini-series was actually filmed at the Stanley Hotel in Colorado, the much fabled place where King stayed one weekend with his family that inspired him to pen the Shining in the first place.  This is the Shining the way Stephen King wanted it made and, frankly, it puts the Nicholson version in it's place.",1036454400,61,949,4.850931677018633
1801738,5,B000077VRT,"This mini series was true to the book, which I loved.  I think it is way better than the movie on from the 70's.  If you read the book, you will love this one",1036281600,3,158,3.6176470588235294
1801739,4,B000077VRT,"This version was almost as good as the original. It stars Steven Weber, Rebecca De Mornay, and Courtland Mead. It is about a recovering alchoholic writer named Jack Torrance(Steven Weber) who applys for a job as a Winter caretaker for the isolated Overlook Hotel. He hears from the manager Mr. Ullman(Elliot Gould) that a man named Grady murdered his wife and two daughters with an ax and a shotgun. Jack takes his wife Wendy(Rebecca De Mornay) and his psychic son Danny(Courtland Mead) up to stay with him. When they get up there, Danny and the cook Dick Hallorann(Melvin Van Peebles) have a talk about a psychic ability called ""the shining"". He tells Danny that if danger strikes, call for help by using the shining. After everyone leaves, the family seems to get along great. Until, weird things start to happen to Jack and Danny. Jack runs into Delbert Grady(Stanley Anderson) and hotel legend Harry Derwent(John Durbin)! Danny, with the help of his psychic friend Tony(Wil Horneff), deciedes to shine Hallorann for help and that makes Hallorann is the only one who can help Danny and Wendy.
It is hard to compare this version to the Stanley Kubrick version. Jack Nicholson IS Jack Torrance, you can't argue with that, but I liked Steven Weber okay. Rebecca De Mornay was as good as Shelley Duvall, although I don't know how she could put up with all of Jack's nonsense. Courtland Mead was not as good as Danny Lloyd. It's too bad that he quit acting, I thought that he was pretty good for a little kid. Melvin Van Peebles was not as good as Scatman Crothers, although in the miniseries it is good to see more of Hallorann. They also change from the Hedge Maze to Hedge Animals.
Not a bad supporting cast: Melvin Van Peebles, Wil Horneff, Elliot Gould, Stanley Anderson, and John Durbin. This miniseries follows the book more. This is one of the best Stephen King miniseries!",1036108800,3,1879,4.7317073170731705
1801740,5,B000077VRT,"This is a ABC (I think) miniseries based on the shining.  It really does a great job of following the book, much better than the old Jack Nicholson movie (but then they also had 3-4 more hours to play with).
  Basically, if you've seen the Nicholson film, forget it! There are obviously a lot of similarities, but a different feel, in the old movie the villian mostly seems to be the father, in the book and this version it is obviously the hotel that is evil.
  This is the story of a truly loving family with problems.  A father who was a raving alcoholic, but who after losing his job and a family 'incident' gave up drinking, a wife who loves her husband enough to forgive, but can't forget, and a little boy, Danny, who is very physic, who knows where lost things are and what Daddy is doing miles away, while struggling to appear `normal.'  They have a LOT of issues, but they love each other deeply.
  In an attempt to turn their life around, the father takes a job at the Overlook, a hotel that is so remote, that it has to be shut down in the winter.  They will be snowed in with no contact with the outside world for most of winter, and Dad will have a chance to write a Play that will put his career back on track.  The only problem is the hotel has a long past....and a consciousness.  Over the years every accidental ...or not so accidental death that has occurred in the Overlook has fed that consciousness.  And Danny's gift would give it unbelievable power, but how to get him?
  You watch in tense anticipation as the hotel tries to seduce a loving father into become the tool to get his son.  It will be a long process, but it has all winter....
  An awesome movie based on an even better book.",1035763200,24,1712,4.280373831775701

1801742,4,B000077VRT,"My husband hated this movie, but I liked it a bit better than Stanley Kubrick's rendering. The parents were both more sympathetic in this one. There was a more redemptive ending, too.",1508630400,2,183,4.75
1801743,2,B000077VRT,"If only we could put the good qualities in both versions together and come out with something perfect.  Kubrick's version definitely delivered the level of suspense and terror required for a Stephen King film and the actors in that story were superior in that film to this one.  Of course, what he did to Shelly Duvall to get her performance was unforgivable.  His Shining is the only one of his films I actually can sit through.  The others, to me, seem like something only people on LSD would find appealing.

However, this version of the story is truer to the book and gave much more detail on the characters and their backstory, which I appreciated - although it didn't hit the level of terror its predecessor delivered.  That aside, the scene with the dead woman in the tub was positively spine tingling, albeit brief, in this one.  I haven't rooted for a kid that much since ""The Sixth Sense.""  Weber and DeMornay have delivered better acting jobs than this.  Their work here is less than their abilities, so I'm going to blame the director and assume that he didn't manage to pull their best performances.  Also, I think the budget for this might have been lower than it should have been.  The party scenes and such lacked the polish and elegance of the era at a luxury hotel.  It felt too much like a dinner party at someone's cabin.  If someone would remake this with a full blown budget and cover the book faithfully, we'd definitely line up at the box office.  Last but not least, the little boy did a good job acting and was more animated in his film than the child actor got to be in the other film.  However, that bowl haircut in this makes him look like a refugee from Hee Haw and was highly distracting from his performance.  It's worth watching once, but I wouldn't say it's worth buying.",1508112000,,1805,4.507692307692308

1801760,4,B000077VRT,"I remember really liking the book and how much I was disappointed later after seeing the movie.  Yes Nicholson was great but it wasn't the story I remembered from the book.  Just recently I found out there was another film closely based on the book.  The story grows a bit slower but it builds the suspense gradually instead trying to jump out at you all at once.  I honestly jumped when the dead woman grabbed Danny.

I'm impressed by the young actor that played Danny, he did a great job.

If you want to see Nicholson at his best see the Kubrick movie, but if you want to see Steven King's story then get this DVD.",1502841600,,617,4.275862068965517
1801761,4,B000077VRT,"I actually like this version better than the big screen version although the acting is often cheesy.  The storyline follows the book much more closely.  It always irritated me that the movie version never really covered how the hotel ""wanted"" Danny, not the father.  I believe Stephen King directed this and he overstates the obvious.",1501718400,,334,5.036363636363636
1801762,5,B000077VRT,"If you've read (and enjoyed) the book, then you'll probably like this.  The scenes were almost identical to how I imagined them in the book.  Do not go into this expecting it to be anything like the Kubrick film, which did not follow the book very well (intentional on Kubrick's part.)

To me, the most important difference is in the characters.  In this version, you get the characters as King described them.  Jack starts out like a normal guy (not insane from the get-go like Nicholson's version) and the hotel slowly drives him insane.  Wendy is a much stronger character... not a helpless waif like in Kubrick's version.  Danny is more interesting and his character is developed better.  The interaction between Danny and Dick Halloran is far more interesting and explained much better.

Kubrick's version was all about the visuals and the atmosphere without ever really explaining anything.  This version is all about the characters and the hotel and actually tells you a story.

The acting and effects are admittedly a bit more ""made for TV"" but the story is so much better that I can look past it.  The only thing in the story I really didn't like is the ending, which differs from the book and was pretty cheesy.

My recommendation:  Read the book.  If you like it, buy this DVD set.  You won't be disappointed.",1501459200,,1320,4.723684210526316
1801763,3,B000077VRT,"Not bad for a TV miniseries - overall, this movie was truer to the book.

1801776,5,B000077VRT,"We recently stayed at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park Colorado where portions of the Stephen King mini series (The Shining) was filmed.  We learned from the day tour that Stephen King had a bad case of writers block, Stephen and his wife Tabitha visited the Stanley Hotel on October 30, 1974, they were the only two guest to be staying at the hotel that night. When they arrived, the hotel was just getting ready to close for the season, Mr. King and his wife found themselves to be the only guests in the hotel, they checked in to room # 217 which is said to be haunted, (This is where room # 217 comes from the book). So later King and his wife have dinner that night in the grand dinning room, there was taped orchestral music playing in the room and theirs was the only table seated for dining. Except for their table all the chairs were up on the tables. So the music is echoing down the hall. After dinner, his wife decided to turn in, but King took a walk around the empty hotel. He ended up in the bar and was served drinks by a bartender named Grady. That night King had a dream of his three-year-old son running through the corridors, looking back over his shoulder, eyes wide, screaming. He was being chased by a fire-hose. King woke up with a tremendous jerk, sweating all over, within an inch of falling out of bed. King got up, sat in a chair looking out the window at the Rockies, and knew he had the bones of the book firmly set in his mind.
This was why Stephen King was so upset after viewing the Stanley Kubrick movie: The Shining; they just took the basic ideal from Stephen King's book and changed almost everything, as a result Stephen King bought back the movie rights and made this beautiful mini series: Stephen King's The Shining; which is the real Shining not the movie with Jack Nicholson. King's biggest problem with Jack Nicholson as the role of Jack Torrance is that Jack Nicholson's last movie back then was: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Stephen King hated the fact that they're casting a man that just played a crazy man to play a role of a man going crazy, this doesn't leave much to the audience's imagination before they see the movie.
I'm very happy with our visit to the Stanley Hotel, it gave us a greater appreciation for Stephen King's book and mini series: The Shining. If you're ever up and around the Denver Colorado area, then your close enough to go visit the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park. I highly recommend stopping in to The Stanley Hotel, you have to do a day tour and walk the grounds of this beautiful place. Thank you for reading my review.",1497225600,12,2596,4.385892116182573

I hate to say that about a child, but his mouth was constantly puckered open so strangely it was incredibly annoying and distracting.

The hotel(in Kubrick's) is extremely tacky, Shelly Duvall's motherly role is TOO much so, like a Kindergarten teacher almost, and there are things that are definitely not loyal to King's book, which annoys me.  A friend once told me of a non-Kubrick version that was more loyal to the book and I'd had my eye out for it until I found it on Amazon. HOORAY!
There is not much to NOT like about this version. The little boy(Doc) is almost too cute for his own good but he does well in the role.
It was a little unnerving that they went to the extreme opposite end of the spectrum with the mom in this one, played by Rebecca DeMornay.
Then again a lot of guys'd probably approve when I mention that one of the mom's first scenes(if not the first) has her in a white t-shirt and clearly no bra. Her wardrobe gets toned down in later scenes. The dad(played by Jack Nicholson in Kubrick's) is so mild-mannered that at first that I had doubts about how well he'd do once the Hotel got to him. Once again he removed all doubts later. Scary stuff!",1480377600,3,1077,4.305418719211823

1801820,1,B000077VRT,"Terrible CGI hedge animals. Check. Seeing a hornets nest and make a stupid decision to try and grab it. Check. Stupid, annoying characters. Check. This mini-series was utterly boring and stupid. I watched it as a freshman seven years ago. I decided to watch it again because all I remembered were the hedge animals, the hornets nest and the grotesque woman in the bathtub singing ""Old mac donald."" Danny is such an annoying brat and reminds me why I don't have kids yet. The way he speaks is annoying, his ugly hairstyle and his inability to follow simple orders and expects to be forgiven. AND his constantly repeating ""It's just pictures in a book"" make me cringe and adds to the sheer level of disgust I feel for that pustule. No wonder the father wants to beat the crap out of him, I was hoping to see it. And
the wife is just another stereotypical clueless house wife who tries to keep an otherwise disfunctioning family under control with ridiculous results. Give this garbage a pass. The effects are bad and the characters are unlikeable and you feel no sympathy for these stupid people. The characters and actors in the original 1980 Kubrick films may have been ugly but at least they had some charm and they weren't as unlikeable as the cast in this terrible remake.",1478304000,2,1275,4.621145374449339

1801858,1,B000077VRT,"Several issues consistently plague the myriad unsuccessful film adaptations of Stephen King's works; one of the principal ones is bad casting, nowhere more apparent than here.  Cute, charming, all-American Weber as Jack Torrance?  Are you kidding? That's an insurmountable handicap from the get-go. Jack is damaged, complicated, and rough around the edges, and should be at least somewhat intimidating physically. Rebecca de Mornay is wrong, just wrong. The hotel is bizarrely downsized and blandly intimate, exuding Toll Brothers, not menace - only the art deco bathroom seems in its correct time; the rest of the hotel is anachronistic in its entire lack of signs of age and appropriate grandeur.  That bathroom is also the site of the only good scene in the entire umpteen hours - the woman in the tub.  The rest of it is a series of crises culminating in a realization that ""the hotel wants me (or you or us) - we have GOT to get out of here!"" Then the action cuts to cheerful playing in the snow or something similar until the next attack leads to the same breathless realization.  The topiaries actually move (really badly - I mean, geez, there was no excuse for such bad special effects) here, as they do in the book, but that's all they do.  Jack lashes out at his damned ""pup"" of a son (not a term a contemporary type like this version of Jack would ever use), then melts into ""I'm so sorry...."" more times than can be counted, but the threat level doesn't really build.  The party guests don't do much of anything, no intensity builds, although the pressure in the boiler does, on command, as the release valve is comically turned, forward and reverse, several times in response to Jack's struggles with his higher power during the ""climax"" of the proceedings.  Awful, terrible failure. Stephen King wanted to accurately represent his great novel, and succeeded in totally neutralizing it.  Whether or not Kubrick's version reflects King's intent, his is at least a well-made movie.",1468800000,3,1992,4.852507374631268

1801870,1,B000077VRT,"King has decided to become a control-freak where movie adaptations are concerned. For those unfamiliar with the differences between the original Kubrick ""Shining"" and the King novel, the differences are quite dramatic. Unfortunately for King -- who has equaled George Lucas in losing touch with reality -- he decided that his same written ideas would translate well onto the screen. Stephen could not possibly have been MORE wrong and the ending of the film bares this out in a cringe-worthy, unintentional laugh-fest.

King used to do situational humor pretty effectively in his novels. Those days are done.
King used to effectively convey horror and suspense. Not only has this ability drained from his writing, but he now wants control over films adapted from his books, which came apart like a cheap suit in this remake.",1460332800,,824,5.103703703703704

After watching ""The Shining"" with Jack N about a thousand times I realize
even though it its a great movie, the music is the biggest star and not the way
Stephen King ment for his story to be portrayed.
So when I bought this version, after learning about the back story and all the drama
between the two versions I totally got it.
This movie has all the details that Stephen King wanted in it. It is his version of his story.
What a concept! Ok there are a few um silly parts.
But hey its Stephen King. Kool,Kreepy, and Krazy!",1452643200,,629,4.121951219512195
1801906,1,B000077VRT,"I watched this when it was on TV and was sadly disappointed. Fifteen years later, I thought I'd give it another chance and borrowed the DVD from a friend. If your sole reason for preferring this rests on the fact that it mimics the book, so be it. It mimics the book, but in such a way as to completely defang it. Absolutely nothing in this TV miniseries is scary, disturbing, or even well-acted. Oh, I suppose it's fine from a TV movie standpoint, and a decent way to kill six hours, but if you're looking for horror, this ain't the place. The Kubrick version was a major departure from the book, which apparently bothered King considerably. That's fine-he wrote the book-he can have a legitimate beef with the adaptation, but if he wanted to do it up the way he envisioned it, he could have taken it to HBO, or made another movie. Maybe the guy just doesn't know how to write a screenplay, but this isn't anything like the book as far as the horror content is concerned. Bad sets, by the numbers acting and directing, bad CGI (the hedge animals are funny, not scary) and a made for TV ending that was just ridiculous.
I won't compare this to the 1980 film, because there is no comparison. Kubrick's film was ominous, foreboding, creepy, disturbing, and scary. The acting was top flight across the board, the cinematography was stunning, the sets and the hotel itself were as much a part of the experience as the story and actors, and the choices Kubrick made have stood the test of time. This ""authorized"" version was forgotten ten minutes after it aired. If unimaginative plot devices that telegraph exactly how you should be reacting are your piece of cake, then you may enjoy this. Otherwise, read the book-it's much better than this over-cooked and toothless re-telling. If you haven't seen the 1980 film-it's not like the book, but it's so superior to this version, even if you'd like a closer adaptation, it beats this hands down.",1452038400,2,1938,4.620289855072464

I love how closely it sticks to the book, I love the actors that were chosen to play the characters and the way that the characters were portrayed. When I first went to look for it on DVD, I was worried I may not find it. Most people I knew personally didn't even remember the miniseries except one or two who remembered it only in a vague sense. I was excited when I found it and have no regrets about spending the money on it. The DVDs work great, the commentary is delicious, and everything is just as wonderful as I remembered it being from when I used to watch it on TV with my grandfather when I was a kid. Just as scary, too! I would definitely recommend this DVD set. Great characterization, great acting, great adaptation. Excellent everything!",1428710400,,822,4.379084967320262
1801938,4,B000077VRT,"I wanted to watch this after spending a night at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park in January (no supernatural experiences). It's common knowledge that Stephen King disliked the Kubrick film for assorted reasons. That film was made elsewhere. Stephen King was inspired to write the novel after staying in Room 217 himself--and also by his own battle with alcoholism. Kubrick's dropping this theme must have been like excising King from his own book. Of course, the topiaries also went, converted into a maze. I have not seen the Kubrick film for years and years--will have to revisit it. Kubrick is brilliant but not always for everyone's taste, and he made a film that was different from King's book in its very essence.

  Veteran actor Steven Weber is excellent as Jack. He is similar to Jack Torrance as I imagined him while reading the book the first time--a sane, serious, and newly sober family man who gradually ""loses his marbles"" (as described in the book). Melvin Van Peebles as Halloran is also excellent. Rebecca de Mornay is window dressing and doesn't infuse Wendy Torrance with any life. She looks flawless in every scene and every time I saw her I thought, ""Wow, she is extremely blonde!"" The child who played Danny Torrance (Courtland Mead) is the most annoying child actor I have ever seen. There are so many cameos (including King himself as the bandleader and Sam Raimi as a garage attendant) that you know everyone was having a blast.

  The real star of the miniseries is the Stanley. I'm glad it finally got to star in its own movie. There is a contest to design a maze for it; I hope it also gets some topiary dogs, rabbits, and lions.",1427760000,,1658,4.680412371134021

It is way closer to the book than Kubrick's film was, and for those of you who enjoyed the book, you will more than likely enjoy this film adaptation. The actors were pretty decent, not the best, but they get the point across. There was a bit of a twist on it with the character of Tony, it wasn't quite how I imagined he would have been in the book, but it was a nice little twist.

My personal two are Jaws and M.A.S.H. I would say the films are far superior to the books. And yes, I have read more than two books. Now the Stephen King's The Shining (1997). A play by play script of the book makes the mini-series fall far short. The things that had you turning the pages of the books came across as cheap thrills one has seen 100 times on screen. Did anyone else notice the actors consistent glances at cue-cards behind the camera? Or how rushed the performances where? It does not look like any rehearsal where done. The mini-series does have a lot of veteran actors whose talents are wasted. Rebecca De Mornay is the main reason for my high rating of two stars. She is a good actor as well as being very easy on the eyes. The best scene in the mini-series is when she tries to seduce Steven Weber, in a white teddy.",1423440000,4,1006,4.4728260869565215

He did the very good and scary 'It' with one the most nightmare inducing evil clowns of all time, 'Pennywise' played by Tim Curry and the wonderfully cast and executed 'The Stand' that introduced Gary Sinise to the world. Garris does another good job with 'The Shining' set at the Stanley Hotel, King's inspiration for the Overlook. It's unfair to compare this version to the Kubrick horror classic and in my mind the changes Kubrick made only added to the terror but this is a solid horror stuff and has it's own scary and surprising moments. The kid that plays Danny, Courtland Mead does a great job in the lead role.

They're a FILM version of the ideas put forth by the author and presented in such a way that they will make sense to a viewing audience. This mini-series abomination blows so many chunks in so many ways that I simply don't have time in my life to list them all. The Shining mini-series SUCKS plain and simple. I'm a life-long Stephen King fan and I love most of his books and movies, but I refuse to go searching and dredging for reasons to like something that is so uncannily bad. Kubrick made a masterpiece out of King's masterpiece. Who gives a flying frig at a rolling donut if it's exactly like the book? Are we supposed to shun One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and call it crap and do a horrid re-make of it because the film wasn't narrated by Chief like the novel is? If I were Stephen I would have been elated that such an amazing, legendary filmmaker had created a classic from my work. Instead he bitches and moans for reasons I still don't even get. It was as if now that Steve is on top of the world, he can criticize absolute greatness. Remember, This was only his third book published under his real name. He only recently acquired notoriety. So what's the best thing to do in this case? That's easy. Crap all over someone who was an established master while you were still creeping around the attic reading your father's Lovecraft books.

1801970,4,B000077VRT,"Comparisons to the Kubric film are inevitable, but where the film was pretty much Jack Nicholson tearing up the scenery, the TV miniseries stayed closer to the spirit of the novel.  Steven Weber does a fairly good job in playing Jack Torrence as a man who is beset by demons, both in his own mind and by the hotel.  But it is Rebecca De Mornay who really excels as the wife who is constantly worried about her husband, but is not going to let herself become a victim when he finally goes over the edge.  And although Melvin Van Peebles isn't as iconic of a portrayal of the head cook as Scatman Cruthers, he still does an excellent job of being the one to help rescue the family.  Finally, a hidden treat is Elliot Gould, who plays the hotel manager with a great deal of restrained smugness in the early scenes of the film.

Furthermore, the film is excellent in creating and maintaining the atmosphere of creepiness throughout the 4.5 hours or so.  Every shot has meaning, and the lighting is excellent, particularly in a scene in the middle where Jack is in shadow and light, which fully represents the dual nature of his character at this point.

The ending is also a treat as it is closer to the novel, but with a twist that demonstrates that even Jack could be saved by the madness of the hotel, even if he had to sacrifice his life to do it.  And there is a very emotional coda in which we see Danny a few years down the road.

That is not to say that this is perfect--far from it.  The miniseries accurately represents the novel, which itself is a bit overblown, and could easily stand to lose an hour or so.  Far too much of the film is building up suspense, without anything major happening.  And the actor playing Danny (Courtland Mead) was pretty mediocre.",1414108800,,1767,4.403076923076923

I had to turn away every time he was on screen. That kid's face is the scariest thing in the film. If you can get past that kid's horrific face and the silly Stephen King dialogue, the film is--as a whole--superior to the Kubrick film in the sense that the tension builds just as it did in the book. I'm not one of those who would say Kubrick's version is bad ... I don't think it was *meant* to be a faithful adaption to the book.

By contrast, ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" actress Rebecca DeMorney plays Jack's wife, who seemingly stands by helplessly as her alcoholic husband descends into madness.  Courtland Mead portrays Danny and, while he's innocent and cute to look at, I must admit that I thought that the young actor who portrayed Danny in the 1980 movie did a better, more convincing job in the role.

1801979,3,B000077VRT,"Many of the reviews here are about the audacity to film another version of THE SHINING thats not Kubrick and Nicholson.
Its been well documented that the Kubrick Shining is nothing like the book. So really there needed to be a version that followed the book and Mr King has done that here. This follows the book pretty much to the letter. The character of Wendy in the book/mini-series is nothing like the Shelley Duvall scared rabbit of the Kubrick version. This one in the book/mini-series is smart and resourceful. I suppose Jack Nicholson going bonkers is the stuff of legend now, but in the book/mini-series his insanity comes on progressively. The only real problem with this version..and its a big one...is the ""actor"" playing Danny. The most important chatacter in the story is Danny. How this kid got this part is absolutely mind-boggling. First off, his mouth never fully closes as if he has some sort of defect that keeps his mouth constantly open. Perhaps its his beaver like teeth,  i don't know. He speaks very poorly, like he's constantly gargling and cannot act at all. That bit of casting really brings the whole thing down. And every time the character of Tony appears one cannot help but laughing. For some reason he's a eyeglass wearing, sneakers wearing floating teen.

1801982,5,B000077VRT,"Arguably superior to the original Shining since the cast consisting of a troubled child and wife-abusing caretaking drunk of a father, a helpless, fearful and bored mother and a curious telepathic son are all more developed than in the original Shining.  That's because this particular version of the Shining is technically a mini series based on three different parts, each one an hour and a half long.  So these characters are unintentionally more developed.

Anyway if you've seen the original, this one is basically the same concept except more attention is given to each family member which perhaps unintentionally boosts the spookiness and atmosphere of the creepy haunted hotel setting since just like the character development, more time is devoted to it.  Either way, I actually do prefer this 1997 version more than the original *holds up shield from tossed tomatoes!*  Not that I hate Jack Nicholson's role in the original of course since I fully recognize Jack Nicholson's performance has become legendary and is the most notable aspect when people mention the Shining, but Steven Weber does a tremendous job teetering between ""A caring loving father"" and ""A complete psychopath planning to murder his family due to lack of alcohol"" just a little more convincingly I think.  It's close though.

Man this movie has so many spooky moments I truly don't know which one freaks me out the most!  How about the animal-shaped bushes that occupy the front part of the property?  They come to life or rather, they *appear* to come alive whenever one of the characters steps outside.  It's hard to say given the trickiness of the writing whether they really are coming to life, since whenever it appears one of the family members is on the verge of being attacked the camera does a tricky ""reset"" move and the bushes return to their original pose position like nothing ever happened and it was all part of our imagination (or part of the characters imagination).  I LOVE this effect!  It teases me really awesomely.  So one moment a lion-shaped bush appears to be sneaking behind the child innocently playing in the snow in one scene, only for the bush to suddenly go back to its original position when the child turns around or whenever the mother or father run outside!  However just before the conclusion we get the answer to this one...

Or perhaps the lady in the bathtub in room 217 attempting to lure the child (played by Courtland Mead if I haven't mentioned it yet- interesting name) into the bedroom/bathroom is another high point, since it seems the moment that door opens the evil presences lurking throughout the hotel seems to intensify to a dramatic extent.  Or when the supposedly empty beehive suddenly fills with hundreds of swarming bees in the middle of the night?  My worst nightmare since I HATE bees!  Actually my favorite moment is the sanity or rather insanity of the father.  You don't want to trust a man like this!  You're constantly sitting on the edge of your seat wondering whether he'll be able to keep his soberness and attitude in check to support his wife and child who are basically secluded (and defenseless) in the middle of nowhere without any outside help due to well... I won't spoil why help can't come.  It's probably not a big spoiler or anything, but I'd rather not mention it.  I don't want to mention ALL the details do I?  No siree!  Let's just say the biggest snowstorm in 10 years changes everything.

Anyway since the emphasis of the storytelling is mainly on Steven Weber's character trying to function normally despite desperately craving a nice cold alcoholic beverage, the father/husband is basically the reason this movie is so remarkable.  Not that I'm taking anything away from the animal bushes, the lady in the bathtub, the bar ghosts or ANYTHING else- I'm just pointing out that the father is the one who gets the most attention and deservedly so for his role.  While I don't think the son is a bad actor like many people do, he could have been replaced with someone else of the same age without any major differences (like say, that Thunder Alley/Sixth Sense boy who looks a lot like Courtland anyway) and the wife played by Rebecca De Mornay is a really talented actress too but her emotions are never quite as strong or memorable like Steven's because they're not supposed to be.  When HE goes crazy, look out!  He has the perfect personality and voice for his role.  You learn to fear Steven's uncontrollable behavior.

For a mini series that first appeared on TV, the acting is amazingly strong.  Arguably matching the original Shining's acting.  At least the son gets his share of attention in this mini series.  In fact whenever he closes his eyes and talks to his ""imaginary friend"" (there's a reason I'm putting that in quotation marks, hehe) we brace ourselves for a possible ghostly encounter.  I just love how the writing in this movie perfectly plays with our imagination and makes us guess whether the events are really occurring or not.  Oh and please pay close attention to the boiler dialogue in the very beginning of the movie since it's crucial.  I admit I forgot all about it a few hours later when the story was wrapping up.  Don't miss that part!

I really like the segment where the ghosts trapped inside the hotel suddenly come to life inside the bar because you're constantly guessing when these demonic figures are going to reveal their real identity.  Turns out they excel at manipulating the father VERY well and encourage him to drink because they know drinking escalates his desire to be angry.  Whenever the father yells at his son and says things like ""Little boys should be punished for going where they shouldn't"" as the son tries to defend himself, you just have to think to yourself as a viewer ""Well come on- he's a little kid. Of *course* he's going to be curious and go where he doesn't belong!"" but eh.. this is a horror movie so that kind of simple parenting logic isn't allowed here, hehe.  Anyway the son's telepathic abilities are never expressed in a cheesy or forgettable kind of way but rather enhances the plot even stronger and makes the movie even better since it adds another element to the storytelling.

Just imagine for a moment.  You're trapped in a haunted hotel in the middle of nowhere for several agonizing winter months and your very own father or husband gradually loses his mind and blames everything on you resulting in an escalation of tempers and uncontrollable behavior.  Yes my friends, that's why the Shining will always be a classic.  No this version doesn't contain the unforgettable blood pouring out of the elevator doors or the twin girls in the upper hallway, but what it does accomplish remarkably well is a proper building of atmosphere and often times delivers with just as many frightening ghostly situations as any one of the classic horror films out there.  If the ghosts don't get under your skin, the father will.  For that I say, this movie is totally worth owning.  5 stars whether it's the original or this version.

1801984,4,B000077VRT,"In this redo of The Shining, with screenplay by Stephen King himself, the viewer gets a clearer picture of the writer's original intent for his book, written back in the 1970s. The original, movie, produced in 1980 and directed by Stanley Kubrick, is probably more about Jack Nicholson playing himself, which he was always want to do as a crazy man. The unknowns in the newer version allow the viewer to see the true story without the distraction of too many great artists trying to tweak the same work. This version is clearer and a bit more logical--as logical as a horror movie can be--and a bit more believable as the actors do not distract from the story. The original is quite good, but it is more about sensationalism and creating the feeling of fear than following King's original story as this newer version does.",1409788800,,822,4.675862068965517

Almost exactly how I saw the characters in the book.  One of the biggest issues I had with the first movie was that Danny's character was never developed.  He was essentially mute through the entire thing.  This movie didn't make that mistake, however they should have gotten a more skilled actor to play this part.  With that aside, the movie is still amazing and captured well the weird and terrifying aspects of the book.  I think it's a solid effort for sure",1408752000,,770,4.554744525547445

The book is amazing and I still like the Kubrick version but I think I like the series better. When I read a King book, especially one as good as the shining, I expect the movie adaption to be at least halfway faithful to the book. The Kubrick version was barely even a quarter of the way faithful to the book. The series however is very faithful to the book and that is what I love about this series. Steven Weber does a good job of playing Jack and, unlike the Kubrick version where Jack was insane almost from the beginning, he is actually a sympathetic character and hero, sorry Jack Nicholson. Wendy in the series is also a much better version than the mousy and passive Wendy in the Kubrick version. The acting all together is very good. Yeah it's 4 hours but it's worth watching in my opinion and i'd rather see the faithful version. Hell, the stand was like what? 12 hours? Yeah enough with that excuse. The Kubrick version and this version are very different, almost different movies but the mini-series is much more faithful to the book and is the better version in my opinion.

Great performances from Weber and Van Peebles still can't save this tired, bland offering. There's no replacement for Duvall's amazing Wendy.
The scariest part is the woman in the tub but even she is a tad ""sexier"" than she ought to be.

No comparison to the original film cast.

Unlike Wendy/Shelly Duvall's love towards Danny/Danny Lloyd, Wendy/Rebecca De Mornay acted as if her child was a nuisance. 'Though I agree Danny 2 was annoyingly whiny.'

The second time around, Stephen King agreed to the remake on his terms, adding scenes Kubrick refused while producing/directing the orignial, such as pouncing animal topiaries, Danny's final communication with his father, Jack/Steven Weber, and Dick Hallorann's/Melvin Van Peebles survival.

1802042,5,B000077VRT,"First off, let me get this out of the way and say that Stanley Kubrick's film is brilliant for many reasons, and I understand and agree with all of them, and enjoy that film more and more each time I see it. HOWEVER... this miniseries CAPTURES everything The Shining (the novel) is really about. Here, The Overlook Hotel is fully realized as a complete world unto itself. The ghosts who inhabit it have substance and depth and the viewer really gets to understand that the hotel WANTS Danny, and will use Jack to get him. Steven Weber's Jack is incredible. While Jack Nicholson nailed the madness, Steven Weber gives us the loveable Jack Torrance at the beginning of the story, who is an amazing father and husband who (because of alcohol) has made some awful mistakes with his family. In this film, you SEE and FEEL the love between Jack and Wendy and Danny. Rebecca Demornay IS Wendy. She's EXACTLY the Wendy the novel created. And I think Courtland Mead's Danny is really nicely played. Just watch him break down and scream at a fighting Jack and Wendy to appreciate what he does here. The last thing I'll say is that while I adore Kubrick's Overlook (the colours, the angles, the way it's filmed), I fell immediately in love with this Overlook Hotel. This hotel (the one that actually inspired King's novel) has a life of its own on screen, and really is believably a place that a man like Jack could see as an opportunity to start fresh. Kubrick's Overlook, like Nicholson's Jack started out dark and wicked and sinister from the get-go. This Overlook changes, little by little. And that change (like the subtle character changes we see in the cast) are what make this one of the best adaptations of a King story I've ever seen, and - honestly - one of my favourite films.",1381881600,,1777,4.591194968553459

Worst of all,they give Jack a croquet mullet instead of a ax while it was faithful to the book,IT'S STILL NOT SCARY!

1802053,2,B000077VRT,"When you're bringing a book to the big screen you can't leave everything in it or it becomes tiresome. For some reason King likes to make his movies way too long and this is one of the setbacks of this particular mini.

 While Steven Weber did a good job no one could beat Jack Nicholson. While it is true that he acted crazy a bit too fast, his acting in the first version was excellent. Weber did a great job too and looked eerie as hell in the end but his personality wasn't as enjoyable. And his dialogue sucks!! ""Come take your medicine pup??!?!?""

 Rebecca DeMornay is a talented actress (loved her in the hand that rocks the cradle) but she wasn't right for this part. Her and the boy had no chemistry until about half way through. Her character was stronger than Shelley Duvalls' but they may have made her a bit too much, while having Jack a little too passive and whipped. Shelleys submissiveness was pretty extreme but it helped the plot and caused a bigger cheering when the timid rabbit whacked her hubby with the baseball bat.

 The little boy was awful - he overacted and overdramatized everything. I didn't find him well casted at all and the scenes with him were painful. I couldn't get into the movie when he was around because I was too busy being shocked out of my trance listening to him talk. Holloran is simply a plot device used to fill space.

 The ending was not in the original OR the book - and it was a little too happy-go-lucky. Cheesy and rivals Disney productions.

 From the VERY beginning we have the hotel doing wierd shit by moving objects, ect, everytime someone leaves the room. Boy does it get tiresome! The worst way to try and evoke fear in someone. By putting it straight in their face from the start and being so damned obvious. Like when they leave the old cash register pops up the no sale sign. WTF?? And how many doors need to close by themselves?

 The hedge animals were an awesome idea. Originally Kurbick wanted to use them but he couldn't get the effects to work so opted for the maze instead. I was stoked on finally seeing these hedge animals but was sorely dissapointed. They look like cheap CGI and are horribly unconvincing. After thought, I decided I prefered the maze. It was used to heighten tension in the original and mazes are pretty creative. I may have liked the hedge animals more if they had been made to appear more intense.

 Another problem was ""Tony"". In the Kubrick version he was in the boys mouth, and we didn't see him. We just saw the kid go into a wierd trance and use his finger to talk in a different voice. We didn't know if he was nuts, if someone *was* there, if this person was responsible for the shining, ect. In this movie they use an actual person - and a flat acting one at that. With glasses and short hair and no expression. He says obvious things just to insult the audiences intelligence even more. And he seems to have very little influence on Danny.

 Sometimes mystery is good. Here everything - every twist and turn - is explained way too much and in intricate detail. I felt like a 3rd grader learning about the history of haunted houses.

 And how could they butcher the significance of Redrum so horribly? In the movie during Dannys trances (the original) and the book it was said as a wierd word and at the end it is shown in the mirror to spell ""murder"". Here they just said it for the heck of it, because they thought people loved hearing the word, and it was overused and any significance lost.

 Since this was a TV mini the violence, any disturbing images, blood, anything is watered down so much it contains NOTHING serious for adult fans.

 Also in the original you can take Jacks madness from either the hotel causing it or the point of isolation and cabin fever. Here there's only one answer fed to us on a silver spoon: ITS ALL ABOUT THE HOTEL.

This is interesting, but it is way too loooooong and drawn out, because this is what Stephen King wanted. King didn't like the original film version and as soon as he had clout enough to make his version of the Shining, he did. This is the result.
I enjoyed the original film much better. For one thing, it is shorter in duration, is action packed and doesn't take several hours to view. Weber, DeMornay and Van Peebles do great acting jobs in this one, but the actors in the original film with Nicholson is way better.
If you want to see for yourself, rent them both and compare. If you only have time to watch one version, go with the original film by Stanley Kubrick with Nicholson and Duvall.

I read that King's main criticism of the first adaption was that Jack was clearly disturbed before going to the hotel.  In this version, he makes up for that by showing a happy Jack prior, and then following it up with multiple verbal acknowledgements that the problems stem from the hotel.  ""It's the hotel!"" says Danny multiple times.  Thanks, kid, for making that clear.

The real star of this movie is the Overlook Hotel.  There's some good camera work featuring the ornamentation, rooms, and such.

True, it's less spectacular than Kubrick's relatively glossy and hyper effort, but if you enjoyed the novel, definitely check out the miniseries.  Both films are worth viewing, but keep in mind that what Stephen King wrote is a very different thing from what Stanley Kubrick filmed, don't confuse them.

Note: This is a three episode anamorphic 16:9 widescreen presentation with commentary -- each episode occupying a single DVD side (side four being blank). Total duration is 273 minutes and although the picture is a little on the soft side, it's not excessively so.  The DD2.0 sound track quality is just fine.

EDIT: Corrected the spelling of Stephen King's name per follow up comment.

The hotel chef, Dick, appeared at the end of the original movie only to be killed before he could do anything, making one wonder why he was in the movie at all; in this version, he played his role in seeing the whole horror through.  On the whole, this was a good, fun watch.  King, as he often does in TV adaptations of his books, has a cameo role that's fun to look for...something like trying to spot Waldo!",1361664000,,895,4.367469879518072
1802120,2,B000077VRT,"It's well known that Stephen King hated the famous 1980 Kubrick version of his perhaps most beloved novel, The Shining. And for good reason too. The Kubrick version of The Shining is completely independent, changing character motivations, plot, themes, and many other points. So I understand why King would often say that Kubrick's version was like a brand new beautiful car that had no engine. It wasn't his novel and he was irritated by the fact that the theme of the dangers of alcoholism was ignored along with some family chemistry that made parts of the book work. That being said, it's well known that the 1980 film is one of the greatest horror films of all time and still is a powerfully chilling movie. So it sorta kinda came as a shock when, in 1997, King decided to direct his own version of The Shining, a three-part, four hour miniseries that, for a miniseries, actually had a large budget. And guess what? As soon as this thing came out, everyone decided that it was junk. Now, I love The Shining, for all it's faults, and I had high hopes for the miniseries. While I wasn't particularly annoyed with Kubrick's changes, I wanted to see how a more faithful adaptation would look on the screen. So I watched it.

And I hated it. And here's why.

King's books, like so many horror novels, are infamous for being unfilmable. They have weird, surreal scenes, goofy characters that come off as hammy on film and t.v, and sometimes, the imagination is scarier than anything Hollywood can make. And that is certainly true here.
I would be lying if I said that there weren't parts in this miniseries that I laughed loudly at. And I'd be lying if I said that there weren't parts in the book that I laughed loudly at. For example,in the book, the dogman scene was just stupid, silly, weird, or all three. And in the miniseries, it's certainly all three. Just watching that guy wear a dog mask and try to come out as threatening really makes you slap your head until it's numb. And that word came to me while I watched the scene unfold: lame.

And what about the hedge animals? My God, the CGI here makes the original Super Smash Bros. look amazing. It was absurd in the book, wasn't scary in the least, but when you watch it happen on t.v, it's just pathetic. Did Stephen really think that this was scary? In the Kubrick film, thank God, there was no hedge animals. Instead, it was replaced by a massive hedge maze, a much better idea. I wish that was in the book. That would have been much better than a bunch of shrubs attacking a little boy.

And speaking of Danny, man, was this where the miniseries got annoying. The Danny here is so bad, so irritating to look at, that every time his cute little face comes on I just want to deck him. And I'm not kidding. His gestures, facial expression, everything, is just off the mark. Compare that to the Kubrick version. The kid seems like a real kid. He gets scared, he's believable, he's a great child actor. But this kid is just plain bad and when your protagonist irritates you, that doesn't bode well for the other actors.

And, believe or not, that not true in the miniseries. Both Jack and Wendy are both passable. Sure, there's some hokey stuff in their lines and deliveries, but, overall, they're fine. Oh, and Hallorann's ok, too. He's the only one in the miniseries that comes close to being as good as the original actor. Scatman Crothers was a fine Hallorann but, to be honest, it's not a hard role to play. Just the stereotypical black guy with a big heart. It's a cliche, but we welcome it. Still, nothing beats Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. Their chemistry was great. And yeah, I know people complain about Nicholson's Torrance being crazy from the start but, isn't he already crazy in the book too? He broke his son's arm and nearly killed a student. Seems pretty nuts to me.

Also this version is closer to the original, and that works against it, I think. Like I said, the book had weird surreal and stupid moments. We still like it, but we wouldn't want to unfilmable moments to be filmed because they just don't work. And they don't work here. I'm sure King tried his best and I'm sure he liked his version more, as he should. But, as a moviegoer, it's undeniable that the superior version is the Kubrick film. It's got better acting, better scenes, and better changes. For example, remember the Grady bathroom scene? It's great, scary, and a masterpiece of suspense and tension. But they screwed it up in the movie by having Grady speak to Jack in front of a throng of people. I don't know, when those two were alone, it made the tension so much more real. But when they're trying to talk in between a big band, it loses scariness.

And that's about it. Am I glad I watched it? Yes, of course. Any Stephen King fan should. But please don't expect a superior film. There are moments where you will feel silly for watching such a thing (hedge animals scene, cough, cough, dogman), and you might even raise an eyebrow or both. But still, King tried his best and even though the finished product is, for lack of a better word, just plain lame, you like the fact that he's trying to give us something new.",1360713600,9,5176,4.488322717622081

In a lot of ways, I actually like it better than Kubrick's 1980 version. The characters are truer to the novel as is the trajectory of the story. Plus, King introduces the film audience to an aspect of Danny's ""shine"" that we certainly DON'T get from Kubrick.
Second, for something that aired on ABC, this is pretty darn scary. I think this succeeds where Kubrick failed in one or two places because King was forced to write and Garris was forced to direct in such a way that they had to bypass blood and gore and actually focus on the tension and suspense factor.

Also Stephen King wrote a haunted house story,Kubrick made a film that had very little to do with the Overlook Hotel. It's not that Kubrick's film is bad,it's just not the book Stephen wrote. I know Stephen took some stuff out,just so it wouldn't be too much like the film,esp Grady who isn't a main player like he is in the film or the two little girls (by far the scariest thing in Kubrick's film,which probably explains their absence here,Kubrick got those right!)but you get the scrapbooks and the hedge animals. You also get a real sense of Jack's coming apart at the seams which miscasting messed up in the film version.
To anybody who hasn't seen this version but likes the book,please rent this film,you won't be disappointed. Also do yourself a favor and rent ""Storm of the Century"",Stephen's extremely overlooked TV masterpiece!
Oh and one final thing,stay away from the awful ""Salem's Lot"" remake and stick with the original 70's version with David Soul and James Mason. Not sure why anyone felt that story needed to be remade but it didn't!
Sorry, but I have one more thing to say and it has nothing at all to do with anything but Stephen if you're out there,when are you going to write an episode of the Walking Dead????????????????????????????? You were born to do it,so don't make us wait anymore! :)",1358035200,,1830,4.721875
1802126,2,B000077VRT,"What in the world was Stephen King thinking when he made this 5 hour travesty? Or better yet, what wasn't he thinking? He threw everything and the kitchen sink in this, yet sadly nothing stuck. I know he openly detested Stanley Kubrick's 1980 masterpiece, a stunning classic of cerebral horror on a grand scale that has yet to ever be equaled. But, was that a reason to defile your own work, Stephen, and try to readapt it - and for television at that? The answer is a resounding no!

From the start, King and director Mick Garris do everything wrong, from the opening shot of Jack Torrance in the boiler room with Watson, to the horrendous outdoor scene of people still at the hotel playing croquet. WTF? So much for creating any sense of isolation. Yes, you can forget any kind of feeling of anyone being isolated, killing any further buildup of feelings of claustrophobia and doom.

Oh, and also let me mention how pretty much from the get-go, King butchers his own novel. Yes, he made changes that would even stump Stanley Kubrick, who performed plastic surgery on the novel in his awesome adaption; and rightly so. Number one, it is mentioned that Grady was at the Overlook ALONE when he killed himself. That's right. By himself. No wife. No twin girls. No family at all. Just him. Not the way I remember it from the book. And I've read the book so many times over the years, I've lost count. And King wanted to badmouth Kubrick for the changes HE made when adapting the novel. Ok, makes sense...NOT.

Then, if all that isn't bad enough, director Garrison keeps throwing in these senseless flashbacks that do nothing but dumb the story down to the umpteenth degree. You know, like they do on the ""CSI"" shows, you know, because they feel people are too stupid to follow what's been said, so they have to show you as well as tell you. And it robs the movie of any kind of suspense right off the bat.

One of the things I really liked in the novel, and oddly enough never thought about being changed in the Kubrick film was the way Danny talked to Tony. In the novel, he talked to an older version of himself, who hovered nearby and showed him visions of things to come. Neat idea. In the Kubrick film, Danny simply talked to his finger, his imaginary friend, the little boy who lives in his mouth. A great idea visually. Well, in this version, as another reviewer so well stated, Danny talks to a floating teenager. And it looks hokey as h*ll. Dreadful.

And, again, as if other things that dumbed down this version wasn't enough, they feel the need to remind you that Jack Torrance is/was an alcoholic, and he had a ""problem"", and he hurt Danny, and he lost his teaching job because of his drinking problem every chance they get. Which is like every five minutes. Telling the audience one time isn't enough. Oh no. They obviously felt the audience was too dumb to get that, so they felt the need to throw it in as many times as possible so you would, you know, get it. Dreadful.

And, speaking of that reminds me of something I had never questioned before until now: I've seen so many reviewers talk about how they didn't like Jack Nicholson in the Kubrick version because it was obvious from the beginning that he was insane. Well, I noticed in this that because of the way it keeps reminding the viewer that Jack Torrance is an alcoholic, and that he once hurt Danny, and has a history of violence, well, right there tells you that he is going to eventually lose it when he gets to the hotel and gets snowed in during the winter, killing any and all suspense. You know, now that I think about, the novel even did that. Heck, if King wanted his readers (and viewers in the film here) to be totally surprised when Jack gets possessed and starts to go after his family with a croquet mallet, well then why not make him a saintly person with a very good background in the beginning. Heck, make him a preacher or something with a pristine background. Someone who would never dream of going off on a mad binge and hurting someone. Now, that would be a surprise!

Anyways.

And, I will slightly mention since I'm talking about certain characters/cast members, another heavy criticism I've heard over the years against the Kubrick film I've never understood was against the great Shelley Duvall as Wendy Torrance, a role I feel she was simply brilliant in. Well, over the years, I've read negative reviews talk about how she was so wrong for the role, how she was too whiny and too weak, blah blah blah.
Well, here's the deal. Sure, Rebecca DeMornay is more like the novel Wendy, however, visually on film, I just don't buy that a woman that strong would be with a man like Jack. Nope. Never. Not in a million years. She would beat the h*ll out of him, set him on fire, cuss him until he cried, and make him her little b**ch. True story.

Thus, making her all wrong for the role filmwise. But she's the best actor in the whole thing. Yeah, I said it, and I meant it. I really liked Courtland Mead's small part in the movie ""Go"", but he is completely wasted here. I blame it on bad direction. And that goes for the performance of everyone else in this. Awful. Atrocious. And I blame it on bad direction from Garris. Watch anyone of them in something else. Heck, watch something else than this alltogether, and you will be better off.

Anyways, even though King made some other questionable changes from his novel in this, I will give it two stars for at least being somewhat as close as it can be. I still prefer the Kubrick version. Always have. Always will. Especially after seeing this stinker.

Thanks for reading.

I love Steven Weber, though, so this version is awesome and fairly true to the novel even though it has been updated to fit with a more current time period and culture.

1802131,5,B000077VRT,So I have seen both versions of The Shining.  Both versions sent a chill down my spine I thought they where both well done.  Stephen King's The Shining I remember watch in high school late at night on the TV.  Don't worry I went to boarding school What I liked about Stephen King's The Shining was how much it came to life.  The part I remember the most which made me jump of the sofa and hide was the women in the bath tube she was so scary.  Any bone who loves to jump off the chair and be scared to death then is the movie for you.,1352764800,,534,3.9074074074074074
1802132,3,B000077VRT,"Let's get one thing out of the way---this movie isn't in the same universe as Kubrick's masterpiece (also Nicholson's masterpiece), and I wouldn't expect a TV movie to measure up to such an acknowledged classic. Kubrick's reworking of King's The Shining is superior to the original in my opinion on a similar level as Hendrix's version of All Along the Watch Tower compared to Dylan's---no contest at all! But that doesn't mean this should be missed for fans of the story.  Fans of the book in particular are sure to be very interested in this version, which follows it closely and answers many questions left untouched by Kubrick's version. I am a fanatical fan of Kubrick's movie and have seen it many times over the years, but I must confess, I had not yet read the book at the time of my first viewing.  The TV version follows the book more closely, but frankly, I prefer Kubrick's vision for this story, at least when it comes to translating it to the silver screen.  Of course, he was greatly aided by the wonderfully maniacal Jack Nicholson at just the right time in his life to play this part, but Kubrick hit a grand slam that makes the TV version irrelevant for casual fans.  However, I am not a mere casual fan, so I knew I would have to view the TV version.  Overall, I came away somewhat disappointed, but I don't regret buying it and would do it again.  It's simply not something I will cherish over the years and watch again and again the way I do just about every winter with Kubrick's, a yearly ritual!

Although Stephen Weber did a very admirable job considering the challenge he was presented with and is the best part of the movie, face it, it is impossible to avoid comparing him to Jack Nicholson. And when you do that, Weber comes up very short. He is already typecast in my mind as the goofy younger brother from Wings and the direction was simply not at the same artistic level as Kubrick's.  I found the kid VERY annoying as well, which alone would have been the final nail in the coffin for this one. None of the other characters were particularly interesting, either. I think a very, very talented person/team could produce a movie that follows the book closely and is much more disturbing than this one, but the result here simply misses the mark. The moving hedge animals were absurd. If they had only appeared to move when a character looked away, maybe, but to actually show it happening? Again, the curse of CGI tempting movie makers to show things that are better implied.

I give bonus points for filming at the actual Stanley Hotel which inspired King to write The Shining. Very cool to see that. But again, I find Kubrick's Overlook Hotel even more interesting. And there is no comparing the musical scores either.  From the very first scene of Kubrick's version, you can feel chills as Jack Torrence's car makes its way into the gigantic mountains accompanied by utterly creepy music, which is a welcome companion throughout.  There are no equivalent chills in the entire TV movie. And the TV movie does not accomplish the sense of desolation....madness....Cabin Fever. These are really the most fascinating elements to me. The final slap to the face of the TV version is the mercilessly sappy ending, which unravels all of the tension of the final hours in a very weak fashion.

I'll put it this way, if Kubrick's movie had never existed, I think there would be very little discussion in popular culture at this point of either the book or the TV movie.",1348963200,2,3492,4.605475040257649
1802133,4,B000077VRT,"I used to love the original movie - that was before I read the book.  Once I did, I realized that the movie wasn't even remotely close to King's story and it became somewhat difficult to even watch.

I very much enjoyed it from start to finish.  I realize some of the effects were somewhat silly, but I also realize the limits of a made-for-tv budget.  That said, the movie followed the story King wrote almost to a ""T"".  I loved the atmosphere and I thought the actors did a decent job in their parts.  I'm pretty sure if I hadn't read the book first I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did, but if you have read the book, do yourself a favor and give this a watch.",1345248000,,695,4.141791044776119

1802137,4,B000077VRT,"I had rented this version of the movie and tried to be as Objective wathing it as I possibly can.  I have read several books of Kings, unfortunately not The Shining.  But I have watched and Loved the original Shining. So I compared both movies instead of Book to movie.  I did walk away really, really enjoying this mini series version, much more than anticipated.

This is all based on my opinion, and know that not all will agree.

For me, initially the miniseries was a little slow on the pick up.  I did like how they gave Jack a little more depth and background. to who he was.  The actor they chose as to play Jack did a very good job, but for me, I had a hard time picturing him being Crazy towards the end.  My opinion, I felt the actor did a very good job, I feel Hugh Laurie could have gotten more of the Crazy point across.

Since I didn't read the book, the only thing I had as a reference was the original.  The original was, of course, much shorter time wise, and had a lot to cram in and you ""Eluded"" to alot of things that happend"". I think that they led / gave the viewers more of the illusion of fright in the movie.  Due to this being a Mini Series, it gave more depth to the story. One of the things that I loved about the Original Version of this movie is their use of the Maze.  Seeing the ""Topiaries"" in the mini series, for me was a tad bit of a bummer - but I guess for a child it could be scary.

Wendy, I did like the reversion of her character.  For me it made it a little more down to earth, a little more real to me. I would have liked to see a little more of the past of the couple so I could see what she saw in her husband, but I loved how strong she was in the movie.  I think Rebecca did a great job.

The son was also well played out.  I feel the son was a very sensitive child and the kid played that very well.  Could have used a little more facial expresions when he ws scarried, but I couldn't help but feel scaried for him.

Some of the outcomes of the movie I did not expect.  I loved the Ending to the movie, wished there was more of the hystorical background of the Hotel, and what happend there and the accidental deaths, but I did like how they had the scrapbook of the hotel in the basement and how it tied in.  I think I enjoyed it so much because the miniseries did NOT have what I was expecting, but had a few new twists and turns that I wasn't expecting in a remake!  Good Job.",1330214400,,2428,3.9628865979381445
1802138,5,B000077VRT,I have read pros and cons between this version and Stanley Kubrick's version. Some people like one better than the other. Some like both. I like both versions equally. Stanley Kubrick's is scary and has atmosphere. I love the actors who were in it. Stephen King's version is also great. It maybe has more sensitivity in it. That's just my opinion. Both versions are different but both great.,1323302400,,391,4.764705882352941
1802139,4,B000077VRT,"Stephen King drew heavily from Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE for his 1977 novel THE SHINING; even so, the result was uniquely his own, and it remains one of his best works.  It was first filmed in 1980 by director Stanley Kubrick and starring Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall; although it was and is popular, it is not noticeably like King's novel in either detail or tone, and King himself is on record as greatly disliking it.  In 1997 King had the opportunity correct the situation: directed by Mick Garris; starring Steven Webber, Rebecca De Mornay, and Courtland Mead; and with a script by King himself, THE SHINING became a mini-series that is much more faithful to King's original vision than Kubrick ever was.

The story is very famous.  Jack Torrance (Steven Webber) is a recovering alcoholic whose drinking always seemed to bring out an underlying abusive nature.  With the help of wife Winifred (Rebecca de Mornay), he has kicked the habit and become a good father to his son Danny (Courtland Mead.)  But his reputation for the bottle has left him without job prospects, and the only thing that comes his way is an offer to act as caretaker of a famous hotel, The Overlook, which closes during the winter due to heavy snows that make the roads impassible.  It seems like a good opportunity for Jack to write and the family to grow closer.  Unfortunately, The Overlook is a hotel possessed by ghosts--and perhaps something more--and the little boy Danny has a telepathic gift, ""the shining.""  And the hotel wants him.

The hotel sets out to get at Danny through Jack's weaknesses, invading his mind, offering him intoxicating beverages, and pushing him to render his wife helpless (and if possible dead) and further pushing him to kill Danny, that his spirit might be consumed by the hotel.  But Danny senses the danger long before they arrive at the hotel, and over time Winnie comes to see it herself.  Jack, however, is blind to the hotel's evil, and he soon becomes a part of its horror show.  But Danny's gift and his father's love ultimately prove as dangerous to the hotel as they are desirable to it.

A good many people have damned this version of THE SHINING with faint praise, saying it is overlong, too literal, too talky, too melodramatic, too this and too that.  I would agree that the first third of this mini-series feels slightly slow and that some of the ""ghost effects"" are a bit much--we're treated to a few too many lamps that light themselves, jukeboxes that play themselves, swings that swing themselves and such.  But on the whole, I think it captures the covert ugliness and insanity of King's novel much better than the Kubrick film ever did.  If you're a die hard fan of Nicholson or Kubrick, you probably won't agree, but if you want to see King's novel faithfully translated to the screen, this is it.  The picture is good, the sound is good, and all three parts come with memorable audio commentary from King, actor Steven Webber, director Mick Garris, and others.  Recommended.

1802140,5,B000077VRT,"Having seen both versions of The Shining, I by far prefer this one.  The movie made by Kubrick was meant to be scary, but it's so over-the-top hysterical that it ends up being a gory comedy.  No one in their right mind would go with Nicholson's character to a deserted hotel for an entire winter, and Shelley Duval is so dysfunctional that you can predict what will happen from the beginning.  I actually found myself wishing it would hurry up just to put her out of her pathetic misery.

The mini-series develops suspense slowly, with the normal-seeming Jack Torrance slowly morphing into a monster, while still retaining love for his family buried inside him somewhere.

The difference in sets between the movie and the mini-series are also no comparison.  The movie sets are bland and modern, about as scary and with as much character as a hospital operating room.  The mini-series has the hotel in all its haunted glory, and as the movie progresses, the hotel turns into a character in its own right.",1320624000,2,1004,4.735632183908046

1802144,4,B000077VRT,"First, this movie is without a doubt better than its reputation.  Anytime a classic movie is remade, there will always be a faction that says it's sacrilege, and will hate the outcome no matter what its quality.  In some cases, that viewpoint is justified, but not with Stephen King's and Mick Garris's version of The Shining.  I'm not foolish enough to try and make the case that this movie is as good as Stanley Kubrick's because hardly anyone would agree with that.  The case I'm making is that it is mostly well-acted, convincingly told, more faithful to the novel, and entirely worth seeing if you like creepy ghost stories or are a fan of Stephen King.  Steven Weber is obviously not of the same caliber as Jack Nicholson, but he has some great moments and particularly stands out in the climax.  Rebecca De Mornay's Wendy is far less whiny and pathetic than Shelley Duvall's, and is actually blonde like the character in the book.  Mario Van Peebles is excellent as Dick Halloran, in my opinion as entertaining as Scatman Crothers.  And I think Courtland Mead does a great job as Danny.  His seizures are definitely scarier than the vibrating face employed by Danny Lloyd, and while he's not as strong an overall actor as Lloyd was, his performance is better than passable.

Another big difference from Kubrick's version is using an actor for the character Tony.  I do think his acting is one of the movie's weaknesses, but you don't have to sit through the talking finger from the old movie, so it kind of evens out.  This version uses details like the Overlook's boiler that are important to the book's plot but were left out of Kubrick's film.  Also, the original ending from the novel is intact and fairly well done, with no maze chase or frozen Jack Torrance, and even though people complain about Jack using the croquet mallet instead of the axe, it's how the story was originally written.  The movie even boldly includes Jack's vicious assault on Wendy near the end in a scene of graphic violence not typically shown on major networks.  I've seen all of the numerous TV adaptations and remakes that have been attempted of Stephen King material and I think The Shining is one of the best of them.  It's not as good as the original Salem's Lot or It, but it's better than The Tommyknockers, The Langoliers, and the Carrie remake, and about as good as The Stand, Sometimes They Come Back, and Desperation.  This movie deserves a very solid four stars.",1309824000,4,2462,4.675174013921113

Child actor Courtland Mead was amazing to watch; a young child actor who obviously is a natural.  Rebeca De Mornay was the perfect Wendy character.

1802147,5,B000077VRT,"Having been a huge Stephen King fan for years, I was so excited to see the original Kubrick version of the Shining.  I had never read the book up to that point, but knew it would be great as King is, imo, the master of horror.  When the movie started I was immediately confused, this did not ""seem"" like King, but it should get better.  By the end of the movie I stood up, looked at my husband and almost yelled, ""This is NOT Stephen King!!!""  Fortunately we lived in Vegas at the time and I left the house in search of the novel.  It took me several hours but I did get the novel that night, started it and finished it within 24 hours.  I love Stephen King and actually finished the Stand within 48 hours believe it or not.  At that point I began my wait for the Shining to come out truly as Stephen King had written it.  That was about 7 or so years as I saw Kubrick's version in '96 or '97.  I was delighted!  I've read the Shining several times and always wanted the movie on dvd but never had the chance to actually look to purchase it.  Now that I know it's available you can bet I'm ordering it immediately!  If you're a King fan, you should too.  If you've seen the Kubrick version, I encourage you to see this one.  Get it from Netflix (they have it) so you can see it how the author intended it.

I read the book when I was 10 or 11 and truly appreciated King's ability to send chills down a person's spine with a believable storyline and characters. When I saw the movie not long after I found some of the long stretches of the movie boring but thought Nicholson played the maniac father brilliantly. As many people have said before me it is not like the movie and also having been made in the 80s the special effects are not up to par with a mini series made in the late 90s. The newer version had the bonus of having King there to keep the story true to the book and adding his abilities as the King of Horror, also the length allowed few things to be cut. I saw the TV series at 17 when it aired and couldn't wait until the next part would come on. The mini-series makes you feel like you are right there with the family and wondering if you will survive long enough for help to come. I'm so glad that they offered it on DVD so that I can watch it again. No one has the ability to make Stephen King's books into movies but King himself, Needful Things, Storm of the Century and Stand By Me can all attest to that fact.",1300147200,,1210,4.045833333333333

I found out that Kubick basically took the premis from the book, but made enough changes that it was indeed a different version altogether.  That's not to say there was anything wrong with that version, but just different.  I think in the 80's it would have been so expensive to stay closer to the original story without CG that Kubic had to make adjustments.  This version made for TV was able to stick to the original story much better.  Kubic's is the masterpiece, but this is a really good version too.",1296086400,,657,4.3884297520661155
1802151,2,B000077VRT,"Over 3 discs and 273 minutes, we are told Stephen King's version of THE SHINING. But while a few scenes are well done, for the most part, this overly long adaption never achieves the ""madness"" of Kubrick's film.

Worst of all, the hotel never even seems to be snowed in or istolated! It's MUCH smaller than Kubricks' Overlook, so you never get to nervously wonder what ""else"" is going on in the hotel. And all of the ""set-ups"" go nowhere.

For example (SPOILER), the ""lawn animals"" come alive and threaten Danny at the end of disc 2--well, when you start disc 3 wondering how he will escape...the animals simply return to their ""non-alive"" state. And while the scene with the woman in the bathtub is very well shot...it too, goes nowhere. There is the idea that a real woman is living away in the hotel--a scary thought--but it's dropped and Wendy agrees that maybe Danny smeared lipstick on himself and choked himself.

While Kubrick's film also starts slowly, there is a sense of dread. The TV version starts slowly...but it's slow for 90 minutes! It's simply too long with flashbacks that are not needed (Jack hurting the school boy, etc.) and when things start happening (achieved best in the 2nd disk) you realize that there is STILL 90 mins left.

And that's where this version totally falls apart. Jack has 90 mins to kill his wife and son. But. He. Can't. Quite. Do. It.

I mean, half a dozen times he has his wife cornered, the mallet is raised...and he doesn't do it. And then, when he's READY to do it...the ghosts say, ""You should really kill the boy first.""  Just dreadful pacing and plotting (and King is to blame since he wrote it.) If this was a 2-night, 4 hour movie, it would have been MUCH better.

And what's the point of REDRUM? It appears on the wall and as we all know, it means MURDER. But the payoff here is just silly. Same with the ending---while I like King's idea of the boiler blowing up, having the ghosts come and help/fight Jack is a mistakes--um, ghosts can't die, and if they were so desperate for Jack to kill his son, why did they let him waste all that time ""trying"" to kill is wife?

Stick with Kubrick or King's book--skip this.",1292025600,14,2168,4.4987277353689565

It turned out to be a drawn out melodrama, full of gimmickry and with very little of the artistic panache of the original movie.  The hotel itself was attractive enough, but from there on, it went downhill.  Neither the malevolent, carnivorous topiaries in the garden, nor the two lame ghost plot participants did much to create a haunted atmosphere in the hotel.  The hotel's creaks and groans and auto-swinging doors were trite and none of the characters were truly convincing.  Rebecca de Mornay as Wendy is alright, Jack Torrance, played here by Steven Weber is an annoying exercise in waffling, being an aggressive boozer one minute, and a pathetic whimperer the next.  He never seems to be able to make up his mind who he is or what he wants,  an irritatingly disjointed character who himself seems to have no idea where he is going.  Consequently, the whole thing is ultimately a three hour bore. While the original movie may have had it's shortcomings in its abrupt structure of the progression of the story, it was nevertheless far more convincing than this mushy rendition which seemed to be nothing more than the product of the mercantile minds at Warner Brothers, doing their level best to wrest additional revenue from a classic story.",1248825600,4,1369,4.896103896103896
1802164,4,B000077VRT,"I feel that this remake may have been more like Steven King's original concept but fell short of Stanley Kubrick's screen vision.  I read the original story years before seeing the Kubrick version and agree it is almost a different story.  However, I really feel that Kubrick's film was superior.

After inspecting the Amazon votes for both films I noticed that out of a sample size of something like 800 for the Kubrick film, it received approximately 4.5 stars from the larger movie going public. This version received a significantly lower score from a much smaller sample size, despite the  fact that the majority were probably fans of Steven King.  I also felt that Jack Torrence was played by a very inferior actor in the King version of the film which may actually have ruined the film for me.

I generally find that the movies made for TV miniseries are a little slow moving because of the timing imposed by the format.  Although not terribly important, the make up and special effects in the King version of the film were also a bit inferior, but not too bad for a made for TV movie. If I had to be critical of one special effect in particular it would be the animated hedges omitted from the Kubric film.

1802168,4,B000077VRT,"Firsly, I can't stop laughing at some of these reviews concerning Courtland Mead (Danny Torrance) and his apparent inability to close his mouth.  I thought the same thing when I saw this mini-series of 'The Shining' and am glad others noticed how his barn door stayed open, as it were.  BUT ... that said, Stephen King's adaptaion of his own epic and wonderful novel 'The Shining' is a very good adaptation.  While Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance is iconic as far as horror films go, Steven Weber and Rebecca De Mornay are almost identical to what you picture of the Torrance family when you read King's 1977 novel.  In fact, Rebecca De Mornay is exactly the character King wrote about.  Her strong and proactive character is a nice change from Shelly Duvall's pop-eyed and hysterical Wendy Torrance (though in fairness, most of this was due to Stanley Kubrick's direction).  Watching Steven Weber slowly succumb to the Overlook's demonic hold is both sad and terrifying, the way it should be.  Nicholson was terrific, but he was unbolted from the start (again, probably a Kubrick directive).  'The Shining' is originally about a descent into madness, and this mini-series allows the time for madness to slowly descend.  It is creepier when we see the commonplace and friendly give over to murderous violence.  Comparisons to Kubrick's 'The Shining' are inevitable.  And both are great.  Kubrick made a fine movie.  Stephen King and crew made a fine adaptation.  Sadly, little Courtland Mead -- open mouth notwithstanding -- is the weaker of the comparisons.  The Kubrick movie Danny Torrance is a much stronger character.  But two out of three ain't bad, and Steven Weber and Rebecca De Mornay serve up 'The Shining' in intelligent high-style.  This is a very strong movie version of a classic horror novel.",1234310400,5,1807,4.97

Super scary - whichever version you get (heck, with the great prices on Amazon - why not purchase them both?) you won't be sorry.  Steve Weber does an awesome job in his portrayal of the slowly losing his grip on reality Jack Torrance.

1802170,5,B000077VRT,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the 1980 Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.  No one can ever top Jack Nicholson's ""Here's Johnny!""  Nor can anyone top his performance.

Naturally when I heard that a made for TV movie version was going to air on ABC over the course of three nights, a total of six hours, I was VERY interested.  I knew from the start that this was going to truly be based on the book, especially since the title is Stephen King's The Shining.  I'm really happy that he decided to not remake the movie (you really can't remake the 1980 version!) but instead give viewers who either haven't read the book a great story or viewers who have read the book a chance to 'see' what they read.  Sure not EVERYTHING from the book is here, but in order to do that, they'd have to broadcast this on cable, not ABC.

I was very happy with what I saw.  Not only was the acting great, but the story was excellent.  Instead of seeing Jack basically crazy throughout the entire movie (mini-series in this case), you see a loving father and husband who is battling alcoholism and who gradually, thanks to a haunted hotel, goes crazy.  That was probably one of the best plot points.  Jack Torrance in the book loved his son and his wife, even at the very end.

What is really interesting is the fact that this was filmed in Estes Park, Colorado which is where the Stanley Hotel is located.  King and his wife stayed at this hotel and it's where he got the inspiration to write The Shining and much of the filming was done there.  I'm not sure, but I think he may have stayed in room 217.  I've never been there but I bet that room is probably booked all the time.

Onto the acting.  Of course no one is going to 'replace' Jack Nicholson.  That's darn near impossible to do.  But I must give props to Steven Weber.  I was really skeptical at first when I heard he was going to be playing Jack.  I had really only seen him in the sitcom Wings.  But wow!  This guy was really able to do drama/horror/suspense.

Rebecca De Mornay was a great Wendy.  From the commentary by Stephen King, she is exactly who he had envisioned as Wendy on screen.  There were times where I thought she was a little boring and looked as though she was really trying a little to hard to bring her character's fear of the hotel to life.

The only person I didn't exactly care for was Courtland Mead who played Danny.  His acting was pretty good but what really irritated me was the fact that he very rarely closed his mouth!  The expressions on his face were sometimes bland and kind of expressionless, especially when he had his visions.  It almost looked as though he wasn't scared...you really couldn't tell what he was feeling until he actually said it.

All in all, I'm really happy with this version.  Even though the special effects are only so-so you have to remember that it was made for television and of course the effects aren't going to be as good as what you see in a movie theater.  And the acting was toned down compared to the 1980 version.  But I'm not comparing the two since you really can't; they are literally two separate movies, both very well done.  It would have been really neat to have Stephen King work with Stanley Kubrick in The Shining.  I would have really loved to see the two of them work on it or any other Stephen King novel.

If you're a Stephen King fan and you love the novel of The Shining, you will really appreciate this version.  I'm not saying that you won't like the Jack Nicholson version (hey, I loved it and I still get scared watching it!), but as far as book adaptations go, you'll like this one.",1228867200,6,3627,4.3343239227340264

The Nicholson version is Stanley Kubrick's interpretation of the story, and it deviates a great deal from the original novel.

This version of ""The Shining"" hews extremely close to the original Stephen King novel, which is one of King's best.  Further, the actors here are much closer to the characterizations in the novel.  In particular, Rebecca De Mornay is superb as Wendy Torrance, and she is gorgeous to boot.  I also thought that Stephen Weber did a very good job as Jack Torrance.  While no Jack Nicholson, he actually nails the Jack Torrance character much better than Nicholson did -- his slow descent to madness is the real story of the book, and he carries it off adroitly. (Nicholson was nuts from the onset.)  Weber also does a great job of portraying a struggling alchoholic.  In this respect I thought he did a better job than Nicholson.  Courtland Mead is pretty good as young Danny Torrance.  I disagree with those reviewers who don't like the lad -- I thought he came across as pretty much a typical nine year-old.  Melvin Van Peebles is a much better Dick Halloran in this film than the chap who plays the role in the original movie version.

1802175,4,B000077VRT,"Stephen King never liked Kubrick's adaptation of his eponymous novel. Granted. Then he finally did it himself in the form of a mini series for TV. He had two things to carefully avoid: direct similarities to the film and direct betrayal of his own book since he criticized Kubrick's film as not being faithful to the book. As for the first objective, he tries hard and succeeds on a few elements. Success with the animals carved from bushes in the garden. Success with the hotel that is not the one used by Kubrick, hence smaller and less spectacular.

But then the differentiation he is trying hard to introduce makes him change some elements that are directly from the book, hence he drops elements I personally consider essential in the book. The use of the radio: we directly jump to destroying it in a fit of furor. The sabotaging of the snow mobile is reduced to some kind of secondary element. He is not shown has becoming both haunted by the past of the hotel and impotent in his own intellectual work: he drops his playwright's project and delves into discovering the past thanks to old newspapers he finds in the cellar, research and reconstruction, that is intellectual potency.

The child does not connect with the killed twins and the man does not connect with the female victim. His going back to the past is reduced to some short sequences and only to two men, altogether. Why has this haunting been reduced? But the famous axe is gotten rid of in favor of a giant crocket hammer that reveals itself particularly sturdy when used as a killing weapon. But the worst is still to come. The end of the hotel is due to the explosion of the boiler. The hotel is not destroyed in the book and Torrance freezes to death in the labyrinth. This explosion is directly caused by Torrance himself in some kind of scuffle with the two ghosts from the past. Torrance hence remains sane at the end and kills himself, the culprit of all this tale, destroys the monstrous hotel, and even worse, a sequence is added ten years later when the boy graduates with honors mind you from his high school in the presence of the black cook who survived what should have been his death and the mother, and, betrayal of betrayals, the ghost of the father expressing his love to the son who receives it with gratitude.

This adaptation by Stephen King himself shows an evolution of the author both because of age probably, answering thus to the criticism that he is too cruel with his characters, and to the medium he is using here, television that requires some kind of curbing because of the wide audience it has. But the series, though the rhythm is slower than the film's and that is good, appears to be a pale version of the book and we do not capture the cold of the winter, the isolation of the place and the horror of the derangement of Torrance and also of his wife and his son.

We miss particularly the mechanism that brings total annihilation to anyone and anything that stands in the way of the planned vengeance of the past onto the present. There is only one answer to that situation SOS and escape if you can. That's the book. The series does not create that atmosphere and that urgency, not to speak of that fate, connected in the book to some kind of lore about Indians.

1802177,2,B000077VRT,"I'm a big fan of the TV mini-series work done by Mick Garris and Stephen King. ""The Stand"", ""It"", ""Tommyknockers"", ""The Langoliers"", ""Salems Lot"", ""Storm of the Century"", ""Rose Red"" etc. (I know Garris wasn't involved with all of them, but he's helmed the best of the lot so far and is synonymous with the King Mini-series niche)I was looking forward to ""The Shining"" when it was first broadcast, and recently re-watched the DVD presentation.

The Good: Steven Weber and Rebecca De Mornay do a really good job as Jack and Wendy Torrance. Weber specifically handles the job of playing an alcoholic struggling to remain sober very well. Melvin Van Peebles is also fantastic as Dick Holleran who first recognizes Danny's ability to shine. Outside of the acting, the setting is top notch, and creates a great sense of isolation. I love the way the ""Overlook Hotel"" becomes a formidable and frightening place as the movie plays out, and the soundtrack by Nicholas Pike is top notch, at times echoing ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Haunting"" scores.

The Bad: The special effects are fairly weak, while the ""lady in the bathtub"" looks pretty chilling, all suspension of disbelief is lost when the topiary begins moving onscreen. The initial topiary attack on Jack is done with sound and quick cuts to the various hedged wildlife, and is very effective. This is soon replaced with lousy CGI effects of the woodland critters moving through the snow, and it just looks awful. Courtland Mead as Danny Torrance is a tough call. It's such a HUGE and integral part of the story you need a really strong actor to carry the role, and Mead just isn't up to it. His lisping, baby-talk voice gets grating very quickly.

I thought this was a decent film, nowhere near the adaptations of ""It"" or ""The Stand"" though. And it's tough, because inevitably comparisons will be drawn to Kubrick's ""The Shining"". Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance in that film has become a horror icon. And while Weber is good, you can't help but draw comparisons to Nicholson's character. Still, if you are a fan of King's novel, and enjoy the various mini-series that have come out over the past few decades based on his work, you will probably like this version of ""The Shining"".",1222128000,25,2249,4.8062015503875966

In The Shining that was done by Stanley Kubrick, it was his ""interpretation"" of the book by Stephen King. And although it was a great movie on its own, it was not at all very true to the book. In this movie, which was a 3 night mini-series on ABC, Stephen King was allowed to make it almost exactly like the book he wrote, simply because there was enough time to! The book was amazing, and this movie will creep you out at times, and entertain you to the max! It is a great story. You will not regret buying this dvd!",1220054400,2,624,3.921259842519685
1802179,3,B000077VRT,"This TV miniseries is much closer to King's book than the Kubrick enigma.  The story is about a recovering alcoholic named Jack Torrance who is put in charge of a winter resort known as the Overlook Hotel.  The hotel was often a haven for severely immoral guests who now spiritually inhabit the hotel as ghosts in sort of a hotel purgatory.  Torrance's young son, Danny, has a sort of an ESP described as ""the shining"" by the hotel's chef who shares this mental gift.  The ghosts in the hotel manipulate the hot tempered and emotionally unstable Jack Torrance to get him to attempt to kill his son Danny beacause once dead, Danny would reside with the ghosts who would use his special ability to strengthen their manifestations.

Unlike the feature film, the story delves into the background of the characters more substantially.  We learn a lot about Jack's childhood, employment failures, struggles with alcohol and rocky marriage to his wife Wendy.  By fleshing out the character of Jack Torrance we can sympathize with his transformation from merely a man with major problems to a crazed man possessed by evil.  We also learn of the deep love for his wife and son which, though buried beneath his darker side, is still powerful enough to help him attempt to overcome the evil spirits.  In the end we view Jack as a tortured soul who we feel sorry for.

The movie is certainly not without faults and it can drag at times but it is worth seeing.",1219017600,3,1447,4.661417322834645
1802180,1,B000077VRT,"Stanley Kubrick was a film artist. I am not sure what Stephen King is when it comes to film, but I do not believe he is someone who respects it as an art form.

Kubrick's film is rich in themes and motifs: Doubling, repetition, lights, mazes, mirroring, Indians, Europeans, white settlers, the American flag. King's films, by comparison, are all what-you-see-is-what-you-get.

This one is no different. Everything is pointed out and spelled out as if the audience is too dumb to discern anything that isn't. To be sure, with Kubrick's version there have been connections made and meanings inferred that were merely the result of accident or continuity error, but I would rather watch a movie that gives me a reason to wonder about something that may or may not be there than a movie that leaves me with nothing to wonder about at all.

Kubrick's Shining is terrifying and a straight descent into madness. King's Shining is a soap opera. It's Leave It To Beaver meets Casper The Unfriendly Ghost.

The Timberline Lodge, which Kubrick used for the exterior of his hotel, looks like a place where a madman might dwell and seems remote and isolated long before the snow has begun to fall. King's pretty white hotel is a picture on a postcard.

Kubrick's elevator gushes a torrent of reddish-black blood. King's elevator gushes confetti and underwear.

217 v. 237. This scene scared me about as badly as taking my child shopping at the Halloween Superstore in October. And how hard is it to scare a child? Film Bathtub Woman scared the s--- out of an axe-murderer! Series Jack leaned against the wall and rattled an aspirin bottle. Did she give him a headache?

The hedge animals in King's movie could have been effective. Did they just move? Maybe they did or maybe they didn't. Maybe the hotel is starting to get to Jack and he imagined it all. But the scene is spoiled by playground objects that do come to life while you're watching them.

Assuming we live in a world where psychics exist, part of the intrigue for non-psychics is in imagining what it is like to experience psychic phenomenon, not knowing what it is like. Now I know; it's someone shouting inside your head. How original. Dick jumps around like he is being tasered, his nose bleeds, and bystanders fuss over him. Compare these antics with the look of sheer terror that spreads slowly over Crothers' face; it is the horror of the hotel that Crothers reacts to, not what Danny says or how loudly he says it.

Weber comes across like a bad comedian for most of the movie. It is painful to watch a B-actor trying to be scary and failing miserably at it. At times this looks more like a parody of a horror movie: i.e., Series Jack making ""bonking"" noises as he pretends to hit himself in the side of the head with the mallet and then joking about Dick being ""a publisher's clearing house winner.""

We are told that De Mornay's Wendy is a Strong Womyn of the 90s. So how does that help the movie? If she's tough and she can take care of herself and her son, then why I am supposed to be afraid for her? De Mornay said of her role that Wendy ""is a woman of power and intelligence."" The implication apparently being that Duvall's Wendy was weak and stupid. De Mornay broke a bottle on Jack's head, kicked him in the nuts, and sliced his hand with a razor blade. Duvall hit Jack in the head with a baseball bat, sent him tumbling head over heels down the stairs, sprained his ankle, and sliced his hand with a kitchen knife. I'd say they're even. To boot, Duvall found her son and got them both into the snow cat and away from the hotel to safety, and she did it without anyone's help. De Mornay had only a wooden mallet to worry about and she needed Dick O'Halloren to rescue her. So I don't get how De Mornay supposedly topped Duvall. Plus, Duvall actually looked SCARED during in her role whereas De Mornay did not.

De Mornay yells, threatens, accuses, and nags almost the entire length of the movie. ""Daddy finally got tired of her spiteful, cowardly nagging and decided to take her to school..."" Can you blame him?

King's Danny is also unsympathetic. Courtland Mead, despite being repeatedly hollered at by his dry-drunk father and warned by Tony who conveniently pops up in front of him, busts into Ullman's office, steals the keys and bullheadedly goes where he knows he is not supposed to go. ""I'll go in here if I want! Go away! Leave me alone!"" alternating with daddy-daddy-snivel-scenes thrown in to make Weber look like an ogre. (Why can't the college professor figure out to just put the passkeys somewhere where his son won't find them?)

What does movie Danny do after the bathtub lady tries to strangle him? He becomes catatonic. He retreats so far into himself that he can longer communicate except via Tony in his finger. And what does series Danny do right after receiving the worst horror of his young life? He dangles his legs off the kitchen table and smiles and tells his mommy and daddy how much he likes hot chocolate.

More reasons Mead is annoying:  This ""extraordinary"" child with ""the drive of a grad student"" is struggling to learn to read at any age (7) when most children already have, and he (oops!) breaks character when he thinks the camera is no longer filming him as he runs from the room.

And why is it that King takes one cheesy line and makes the actors repeat it over and over and over? Get down here and take your medicine! Damn nosey little pup! Kissin', kissin, that's what I've been missin'! Just like pictures in a book! In film Shining Danny Lloyd said ""just like pictures in a book"" one time. Once. And that was enough. Zero times would have been enough for others. And zero would have been enough times for this remake to be done.",1216684800,32,5739,4.551891367604267

I was happy when this version came out because it was truly like seeing the book come to life.  It is quite a long movie (approx 3 hrs, 2 discs) but I have watched multiple times and enjoy it every time.  I actually got to go to the hotel where it was filmed in Estes Park, CO and take the ghost tour and see where Stephen King thought up this chilling story.

The movie is about a recovering alcoholic that takes a job as a caretaker of the Outlook Hotel (truly known as The Stanley Hotel, Estes Park, CO) with his family over the winter.  The hotel has its secrets that the son has a intuition about and can ""see"" the visions of them.  They call the visions ""the shining"".  The resident ghosts start to make their presence known through the father as they prey on his weakness as a recovering alcoholic and sort of make him go crazy and want to kill his family.  Due to the fact that it is winter time the family cannot escape easily so it truly becomes a hide and seek game.

Even with the small screen/smaller budget, by far and away this is a much better version and is faithful to the book.  I also prefer the characterization in this miniseries to that of the movie, and just overall felt it was far stronger and creepier in the way it was supposed to be.",1209168000,3,671,4.483606557377049
1802188,5,B000077VRT,"I read the book, but have not seen the Kubrick version in its entirety.  Still, I think this is a great adaptation of the book and perhaps a landmark in made-for-television horror.  That may not float well with some, but TV sometimes does horror better than feature films since it doesn't over rely on gore for cheap thrills.
  Val Lewton who produced horror films in the '40s said that a good horror movie should have a worthy drama beyond the horror elements of the story and Stephen King I think knows that.  Feature films are practically in love with cheap thrills.  They have been since the late seventies.  So it is kind of interesting that Hollywood keeps going back to King for original horror material.  I think it is because of the human drama inside of the horror story that King continually delivers.
His characters are often alcoholics, writers, and vulnerable people visiting rural areas wrestling with their personal demons...and suddenly encountering very real ones.
The thing I notice most about King's stories is that they grip you with a sense of true dread.  A book doesn't scare you like a movie.  A book needs that sense of sustained dread.  A movie relies on guys jumping out of the shadows more, and once you get over that then a guy simply jumps out of another shadow.
So let's talk about The Shinning.  This was a three part mini-series on TV starring Steven Webber, Rebecca DeMornay, and the little boy Courtland Mead (and enough criticizing the kid's acting people.  He does a fine job).
As you probably know, Jack Torrance (Weber) is a recovering alchoholic hired as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, a huge remote vacation spot that closes in the winter.  He takes his wife and son with him thinking this job will help him rebuild his life after being fired from a teaching job.  But the deserted hotel is obviously not really deserted.  The ghosts of mob hitmen, bartenders, bitter lovers, and other dark entities are there.  When Jack's son, Danny (Mead), enters the hotel he's like a lightning rod because he has the Shinning.  He has an invisible friend named Tony who tells him the future and he can see the ghosts.  At first he is lead to believe they are like ""pictures in a book"" that cannot truly hurt him...but he finds out that his presence at the Overlook has changed that.
But Jack is the weak spot that the ghosts know they can use to get Danny.  He's vulnerable.  Wendy Torrance (DeMornay, still looking as hot as she did in Risky Business) wants Jack to succeed but he's hurt her emotionally, and their son Danny physically...once, when he was drinking and he's been remorseful about it ever since.
This dysfunctional family unit wins our sympathy immediately.  Something I think was a weakness of the Kubrick version (from what I've seen of it).  This is a likeable group, an attractive couple and their innocent son, facing that horrific King dread I was talking about and doing it all on their own.
  Perhaps the one dissapointment in this film (and it is a minor one) are the hedge animals that come to life.  I didn't find them the least bit scary.  Not nearly as scary as the ""217 lady.""  Certainly Steven Weber's performance is chilling as the ""manager"" of the Overlook gains more and more control over him.  I found the acting to be excellent across the board.  Actors in horror movies sell the scares even more than the special effects.
So there we have it.  An excellent horror mini-series that I think is one of (if not the best) King adaption I've seen on TV and can hold it's own against many a feature film.  Are you waiting for me to say it's better than Kubrick's?  If I get around to seeing Kubrick's version I'll let you know, but I like this one a whole lot and I can see how it is faithful to the original story.",1205020800,4,3777,4.581222056631892

Even when I LOVE Jack Nicholson as Jack in the 80's movie and NO ONE else could've played that roll at that time, I agree with King Jack Nicholson is just scare and looks insane even when he is normal.

1802198,1,B000077VRT,"What can I say about this film that is good? The acting is very shallow. The movie was cheesy and very very very long.
What interest me about Stanley Kubricks version was how real and to-the-point it was. This Jack reminds me of a couple people I had known, to have this spooky side to them. The wife is also someone I can relate with, knowing one wife who was married to a drunk. So to me, the acting in the original was quite real, which also added to its terror.
The new one apparently didn't do the research.

There are more flashbacks than I could care for in this movie. Hardly anything is left to the imagination, which is powerful; it makes books exciting.
We don't need flashbacks about his drinking problems, we don't need flashbacks of him hurting Danny's arm. Saying it is enough. And what is with this physic Danny anyways?
I couldn't believe it. The mother is going off, asking him these physic questions. In the original, he was a shiner, and was basically just between him and Tony, couple times with the cook.

This version has too many of those in-your-face scenes. People leave, and something moves. The original was done better, it was left more to the imagination.
Jack was crazy, a dry angry drunk that sees ghosts, people he was once with, Llyod the bartender and Grady. Wendy enters the Ball room and there he is alone, nothing to indicate a party or any drinking. That is spooky. He is imagining that he is really having a drink and talking with Llyod. That is spooky.
What happens with the new version? Other people see it, the drinks, the ghosts, etc. It doesn't make Jack crazy, like the way it should be. It makes the overlook haunted, but in poor taste. See The Haunting (1963), old and new (99 I think). There's a difference.
And if a mad man is going to go off and kill someone, he does it. The end.
What is with this guy talking to them for like a half an hour?!? He just goes on and on, with this mallet in his hand, just talking and giving his wife an occasional hit. Just kill her! You're a mad man. In the original version, when he was set to kill his wife, he tried exactly that. He didn't pause to go and have some ""conversation"" with her. He used an ""axe"" and chopped down the door to get to her, not a mallet.
And what is this ""A couple more hits, and I think you'll get that door down."" ""care to take a few hits yourself Grady?"" WHAT!!?!? Is this some spoof/comedy? I laughed to myself when I saw that. and the quick cut on his hand from Wendy in the bathroom. It went so fast and it was so sloppy, and wait, there's Grady.
""The cook is here. best to take care of him"". ""okay. um honey, you stay there. ill be right back"". I say what?! oh comedy? oh okay.

and what are these ghosts doing? Guding him to kill the family? a real killer doesn't need guidance. He/she simply just does the job. Jack in the old certainly didn't need Grady telling him left and right on what to do,
""Maybe you should take that bat away from Wendy"" ""Okay, I think I will."" ""she is currently reading your book, an excellent book by the way""
It's stupid. and I'm thankful that wasn't in the original, new as well. you see how dumb it is? right?
Do avoid this. It's done all wrong, it's way too long, too much in your face, shallow actors/actresses. Remember, I can relate to the other people. I have been with such people that had acted like Jack and who had been married to someone like Jack, a drinker. So I know it was well done; original that is; and the new was not good in any way. Again, avoid!

Finally. Remember ""All work and no play makes Jac a dull boy?"" Nothing in the new version about that, not a thing. The most horrific moment in the original, and not even in the new. Do do, please, do avoid.",1170115200,17,3726,4.258474576271187

The defenders of the Kubrick version certainly have some ammunition, but I feel this is mostly due to Kubrick's outstanding, as always, cinematography.  The ascent up the Overlook, the many disturbing images (the ghostly parti-goers in particular), will burn right into your memory.  But undermining that effort is Kubrick's misanthropy, which runs counter, despite all his love of horror, King's belief in the goodness of at least some people, the value of love (and family, however dysfunctional) in helping to overcome evil.  Director Mick Garris captured this element perfectly, and it's reflected in the fine cast.  Stephen Weber gives us a real Jack Torrance, and not the wildly overacted version that Nicholson provided.  Rebecca de Mornay is also a more rounded Wendy Torrance than the catatonic Shelly Duvall who feebly had to beat at the air while Nicholson made funny faces.  But it's child actor Courtland Mead as Danny Torrance that pulls the movie along.  This is his movie, and it's a shame he did not receive more recognition for his performance.

1802203,1,B000077VRT,"King's literary magnum opus should probably never have been translated to the screen at all; the book was a peculiarly psychological masterpiece. Now that we have the gift of perspective, we can see that Kubrick's eerie ""take"" on the story was likely the best ""shot"" possible.

  This TV-adaptation is an enormous disaster. Aside from the wretched miscasting (on every level!), this ""film"" literally rapes the book without ever capturing the slightest hint of the book's brilliance. The performances are grippingly awful and contrived (by Weber, especially). The ""special effects"" (all of the hotel phantoms are painted like cheesy dimestore Halloween ghouls?) are a joke--one is prompted to LAUGH at these ""touches.""

  King may have crammed more elements of his actual ""plot"" into this film adaptation, but the method was sheer madness. What's the point? An awful film. Poorly acted. Horrendously scripted. Despicable cinematography, too! A bracingly BAD and desperate piece of miscalculation. Cheap. Unconvincing. Ludicrous.

  Quite fortunately, King's book remains a classic. This ""vanity film"" is mind-bogglingly dismal, and an insult to the book. Kubrick really came the closest possible...in his adaptation of the wrenching psycho-piece. What possessed Stephen King to put forth this hacked-out mess is beyond me. (Mr. King, don't mess with stuff if it even comes REMOTELY close to your admirable work).

  Honestly...read the book. Stay far, far, far away from this failure. King is one of our true American treasures as a storyteller, but he has consistently failed to find film-makers with the unique vision required to ""screen"" his stories. Of course, 'Carrie,' 'Misery' and 'Dolores Claiborne' are some exceptions from this prolific and much loved genius, as is the rather watchable 'Storm of the Century.' Everything else has been brutal.

What's great about the miniseries (and one of the ways it tops the original) is that it builds tension and mystery slowly.  In the Kubrick version, Jack Nicholson is crazy from scene one.  In this miniseries, you get to watch Jack Torrance (played quite well in the miniseries by Steven Weber) slowly lose his mind.  I really got wrapped into the story, and the miniseries maintains the tragic tone that was so resonant in the book.

The problem with the miniseries, however, is that the climax (Jack Torrance attempting to kill his family) doesn't work as well as the Kubrick movie.  In fact, it pales in comparison.  The climax is too drawn out, and it doesn't have the excitement and sheer terror of the Kubrick movie.  Still, it is a good movie, and by TV standards, it's pretty good.

The DVD includes two main features--deleted scenes and a commentary (by Weber, Garris, and King himself).  The deleted scenes--like most other DVD deleted scenes--are nothing special.  The commentary is great though.  Weber is pretty good.  And Garris provides good insight and antecdotes.  The real treat though is King, who is funny, animated, extremely humble, and very smart.  The commentary is worth checking out if you buy the DVD.",1154476800,6,1484,4.852589641434263
1802205,1,B000077VRT,"The Shining. The TV version. Completely void of the menace that is Jack Torrance. The boy, Danny, is quite possibly the most annoying child actor ever filmed. His imaginary friend is a ridiculous and also incredibly annoying floating teen in hightops that speaks as though he's hosting sesame street.

While this version is the true to the novel in perfect chronological order, it's also accomplished the task of turning the best horror novel ever written into a cheesy, unbearable, TV safe movie.

Bravo King, another laughing stock TV ""Horror"" movie! With the results of 'Dreamcatcher' I think most fans would approve of you sticking strictly to the writing horror. Stop selling out and Stop selling your scripts to cheesy television networks. Please leave the production of your movies to visionaries and acclaimed directors like Krubrick. Bringing darkness to the screen is an entirely different affair than bringing it to paper. Bringing great novels onto film must be entrusted to the best producers and directors in the profession, not some B movie/TV made director clown. All of King's TV made movies have had shameful results. This piece of garbage is no different. The only reason I didn't shut it down early is that I enjoy the book so much I wanted to see how each sequence adapted to film. What I found was a lightened film completely void of anticipation and terror.

Even for the biggest Overlook/Stanley hotel horror fan this film is not worth watching. Not even once. It ruins the visions you had of the events and chapters and turns them into atrocious and  unintentional slapstick PG horror. If you prefer a ""lighter"" shade of Overlook and Jack T. than this is for you. If you prefer your perception of the novel untarnished than just read it again or enjoy Krubrick's dark, albiet somewhat liberal, adaptation of the story.",1153699200,18,1843,4.935483870967742

As opposed to most people, I believe that Steven Weber was an excellent choice for Jack Torrance. He was able to pull of a very human version of Jack. I really liked that. This was a major part of the original book that was missing in the Stanley Kubrick version. I don't care what anyone says, that was one of the most important elements of the book. Without it the story...feels empty and pointless. Besides Weber, the rest of the acting was so so, not great.

It's a very fun movie to watch. I actually find myself watching it every time it's on TV and when I need something fun to watch. Yeah it may not be as well made as the original Kubrick version, but that doesn't mean it's not as fun to watch.",1148947200,2,881,4.301204819277109
1802209,1,B000077VRT,"Ironically, this version of the Shining is more faithful to King's novel than the original movie was. However, this new version failed to capture the suspense and horror of the book. I heard that King was not happy with Kubric's version of the movie, particularly in Jack Nicholson's over-the-top portrayal of Jack Torrance. Yes, Nicholson took this character and made it his own, but it WORKED. The new movie features one-dimensional portrayals of these characters: where Nicholson was over the top, Webber was utterly devoid of personality. The actor who played Danny in the new version was really painful to watch as well, which did not bode well for this film.

Overall, when compared to the original movie, this remake is an inferior film. When compared with the book, this remake is true to the storyline, but the acting fails to bring these characters to life.",1148083200,11,867,4.938356164383562

One would naturally conclude ""Well, it came from the horse's mouth"" so to speak. Granted, the details are a lot more true to the book than the Stanley Kubrick film. But other than that, this is little more than a campy piece of crap that drags on far too long. Yes  I know, it was a mini-series, but it is still painfully long. I didn't find the actual book that frightening, and this was even less so. The part of Danny, played by Courtland Mead, was atrocious. This kid can not act, at least not at the time of the production. I was also disappointed by the performance of Steven Weber...I've seen him do a better job in other roles. Furthermore, I don't think he was right for the part of Jack Torrance. The least annoying character was probably Wendy played by Rebecca De Mornay, but even that was only marginal. Ullman played by Elliot Gould, while closer to the book's potrayal, came across like a flaming fruitcake. The ""attack"" by the animal topiary was just silly.

The Stanley Kubrick film with Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall...now THAT was frightening. Overall, this movie has no redeeming value for me and I don't recommend it. Shame on you, Stephen King.",1146355200,8,1281,4.541125541125541

Just do not expect something as great as Stanley Kubrick's legendary version of The Shining. I would call this being close to being a semi-great movie. Still, this is a very good movie that is definately worth viewings.

1802212,2,B000077VRT,"Whether this 1997 ABC television movie version was entirely faithful to Stephen King's original novel is almost irrelevant.  The film is doomed from the start for two reasons; the minor being that when you have the now-classic 1980 Stanley Kubrick/Jack Nicholson version (faithful or not!) looming in the shadows like a parasite, you can't possibly expect to come close.  The major reason being, simply put, it wasn't scary; not even a little bit.

If you're making a Stephen King TV movie out of a Stephen King book that's supposed to be scary, and it ISN'T, then it's project over!  Not that it can't be done on TV, though.  IT and THE STAND were effectively frightening in all the right places.

Too much detail in this case, is not a good thing, the scary factor isn't all that great eaither, compared to the level of horror people are used to with modern films, the antics presented by The Shining isn't scary, it's just fascinating on the aspect of paranormal sciences, you will see alot of psychic impressions, manifestations, telepathic infection, and the like...it has much more impact through imagination, not on screen.

If you're a collector of SK flicks, by all means, buy this, but if you're a fan of horror films, don't get this, this is the best cure for insomniacs.

1802217,1,B000077VRT,"When I read through the mixed reviews of King's TV mini-series 'The Shining', I keep seeing the comments 'True to the book' or 'Closer to the book than the Kubrick version'. Based on these inaccurate comments one can only come to the conclusion that these reviewers have never read fully the King novel or, if they have read it, retained nothing from it. The mini-series version of 'The Shining' is NOT true to the novel; and what is most surprising and appalling about this is that King himself wrote the screenplay for the mini-series, and brought this mini-series to the small screen for reasons of bringing justice to his story after the Kubrick version deviated from it.

Although the motivation of the characters and a skeletal representation of the story remain faithful to the book, 'The Shining' mini-series is full of plot changes and inconsistencies, as well as dialogue changes and even a few character changes -- none of which have/had anything to do with entertainment/artistic quality or the limiting factors of a made-for-TV horror movie. (I could make a very long list of all the things that deviate from the book, and none of them were necessary nor gave any more meaning to the story.) And -- with the exception of Rebecca De Mornay -- the casting and, hence, character credibility in this episodic version is outrageously bad. And as far as the direction of this travesty, either this director is a visionless hack or he is too easily wooed, manipulated and influenced by King's own direction and screenplay.

King's novel 'The Shining' is arguably one of, if not THE, most scariest books ever written. I've read it many times and it (just  like the Kubrick film) still scares the hell out of me and creeps me out every time I read it. This mini-series is about as scary as an episode of Goosebumps. It's a corny Saturday morning TV melodrama that DICTATES to the audience that it is scary and dramatic, using all the same hackneyed, trite horror movie sound effects, music, and gimmicks that have been used for far too long.

Because the best scare and the best horror is the kind that is brought out in the mind and imagination of the reader, King's literature works best as literature and not as a film adaption of literature. But regardless, despite the highly necessary deviations the Kubrick version makes, the Kubrick film captures the real feeling and the real horror of King's book, as well as achieves it in far less time. Despite the amount of time the mini-series is bestowed, it fails in every way to achieve what it sets out to accomplish.",1134950400,16,2573,4.749440715883669

1802224,2,B000077VRT,"Ever since 1980, when Stanley Kubrick's epic film version of his novel came out, Stephen King has gone out of his way to slam the late director for having taken so many liberties with ""The Shining.""  So in 1997, to make sure it was ""done right"", King adapted the novel as a three-part ABC-TV miniseries and put director Mick Garris in the driver's seat, as well putting Steven Weber and Rebecca DeMornay in the roles played by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall in Kubrick's version.

The end result, unfortunately, aside from showing why Kubrick's film remains so memorable, shows how insufficient a writer King is when he is not writing novels but writing for television or directly for the cinema.  What works in print will not necessarily translate to either the small or big screen, and that is a truth that King, as good a writer as he is (and he is one of my favorites), has never come to grips with.

The whole story is still the same, with the Overlook Hotel and its penchant for violence and murder, and young Danny Torrance and his alter-ego Tony, and, of course, his ""shining.""  The moving topiary animals of the novel, which Kubrick could not replicate because of special effects limitations, are in this version.  But there are also elements, such as the subplot involving Weber and Alcoholics Anonymous, and the trick ending, of the Overlook being ""rebuilt"" after it is consumed in a firestorm by its own aging boiler, that struck me as being peculiar at best and terrible at worst; it's almost as if King, seemingly so obsessed with ""getting back"" at Kubrick, had gone out of his way to trash his own novel.  It just didn't make any sense.  Nor did Garris' often slipshod direction of the proceedings, as the story never reached the chilling and disturbing heights of the 1980 film.  Weber does a good turn as Jack Torrance, given that he is forever in the shadow of Nicholson; and DeMornay is sufficient as Wendy, though there's no trace of the psychological hysteria of Duvall's performance in the Kubrick film.  But the actors who played, respectively, Lloyd the Bartender and the murderous caretaker Delbert Grady here categorically COULD NOT hold a candle to either Phillip Stone or Joe Turkel in Kubrick's opus.  Nor could Courtland Mead in the Danny Torrance role done by Danny Lloyd; here, he is just simply obnoxious.

Kubrick's film may have taken great liberties with its source material, but the end result was a film whose unsettling images have remained in the public's cinematic mindscape for the last quarter century.  This three-part miniseries simply can't stand up to scrutiny; and for that, Stephen King has no one to blame for this flick's failure but himself.",1126828800,14,2696,4.809523809523809
1802225,1,B000077VRT,"Stephen King is an author with a gift for capturing a mood with clear and concise writing.  He is not, however, brilliant at writing screenplays.  His dialogue is so bad sometimes that it makes it hard to tell if the actors (mostly the child who played Danny) were really that bad or if it was just the script.  Also, I realize that this was actually a mini-series and not a feature film, but King felt the need not only to include every detail from the book (including the unintentionally hilarious hedge animal scene) but even added more parts not included in the book.  In addition to this problem, there were countless times that Jack would have a character beaten and ready to kill only to stop and say ""It's time to take your medicine"" or ""you little pup"" as the person inevitably escaped.  These two factors served to drag the movie on for so long that all of the feeling of urgency is lost, leaving the climax pretty anti-climactic.  Many people will prefer ""Stephen King's the Shining"" to the original movie because it is more true to the book. I know it's not really fair to compare the two so I'll leave you with this- if you want a warm and fuzzy fairy tale Shining, go with the new.

1802231,4,B000077VRT,"There has been much landblasting when it comes to this version of Stephen King's work. While Kubrick obviously went barmy with King's work and made it more along the lines of a slasher film, the TV version works more on the pyschological aspects of Danny Torrence and his clairvoyant abilities to see the spirit world.

As for room 217, the scene was much better than the 1980 version. We get to see the woman as she was intended, more gruesome and evil than Kubrick managed to rush to the screen in his adaptation. It's in Danny's second trip to the room where he finally realizes that the evil can and will harm you if you mess with is enough - as he did, almost tempting the hotel's evil to hurt him. I can still hear the shrill voice of the dead woman as she tells Danny, ""You have teeth!""

I truly believe each version of the Shining has it's own pros and cons. For the original, Nicholson's character is more humorous than scary. Steven Weber's Jack Torrence is more aligned with the book and Rebecca DeMorney's Wendy character is more believable than Shelly Duvall's ghoulish portrayal of the woman. The frights aren't as frequent, but the one's that do strike, strike hard and leave an imprint that the 1980 version seems unable to achieve.

I personnally am the biggest fan of Steven King's novels on the planet, but how true a film is to a book has nothing to do with how good a film actually is.  Film and Literature are two completely different forms of media. Anyone can make a retread or carbon copy of a book, but it won't be very entertaining.  Stanley Kubrick's version of the Shining is better and I'll tell you why.  Kubrick(the greatest director/artist to ever live) felt no need to over explain every single detail(which is fine to do on the page) about what's going on, which made his film much more eerie.  Also, he used a lot of FILMAKING techniques such as sound, stunning and expansive camera shots and angles, and superb acting which all created a creepy feeling. He had an eye and saw things other people didn't.  This is called ""being a talented film-maker"".  This TV remake is the work of a director who simply wanted to tell the story, but who had no eye for how to do that his own way or how to do it visually.  The acting is also horrible compared to the original which tends to be distracring at times, not to mention the overuse of horrible special effects in this remake that Kubrick had no need for.

this story is so much more complex than the kubrick version. the kubrick version was so straight forward and simple. this one is easily scarrier. thats another thing id like to address is the scariness. the kubrick was, despite popular belief, not scary. this one actually was creepy and suspenseful and made me jump a couple times. this is the scarrier version.
dont get discouraged by the length, because i rented it and watched the whole thing and then watched it again with the commentary and didn't get bored. the commentary was so good too, with king in it i was all from the horse's mouth.
this one was really good. the people who say otherwise don't know any better than to follow the original movie and follow all the other sheep who say its ""one of the scariest movies of all time."" this one is so much better than kubricks. faithful to the book and the true shining.",1111104000,5,1289,4.512820512820513
1802238,4,B000077VRT,"As everyone has already said, this is a tv adaption of the book, etc.

The film is completely different to the Kubrick version of the same name. In my opinion Kubrick's version is so different it shouldn't really have been associated with the book. He was more obsessed with the native indian theme running through it than anything else.

Anyway, Pros first:

1) People who love the book will love the miniseries. It is very faithful to the novel, and the Stanley Hotel is exactly how i pictured the Overlook, not the huge, grotesque 1970s monstrosity used in Kubrick's version.

2) I thought the soundtrack of moody Big Band music was excellent and King managed the transition of the book's key scenes (room 217, the Ballroom party, the ending) very well (apart from the very end of the film)

3.) Rebecca DelMornay (apologise for spelling!) and Steven Weber are excellent in the lead roles of Wendy and Jack. I'm not the first reviewer to attest that the wimpering Wendy sap portrayed in the Kubrick version annoyed the hell out of me. This Jack's descent from a loving parent to a Roque (not crocket!) mallet weilding lunatic is very disturbing.

4.) The Grady and Derwent characters are excellently acted.

Cons:

1) Courtland Mead really cannot act, and his nasal voice and quivering upper lip soon get very old.

2) One of my favourite characters in the book was Mr Ullman, the hotel manager, and his apperances in the film have been scaled down considerably.

3) The topairy animals are very creepy until they start to 'move' with the help of 1997 era special effects. Then they just look silly. See the King miniseries 'The Langoliers' for a look at how a scary film is ruined by early computer effects.

In Conclusion, an excellent, faithful adaption of the book i prefer to Kubrick's insane version. As a sidenote, someone in a previous review mentioned the ommitance of the Clock spurting blood and gore. Without giving too much away, if you look closely at the end, we see the clock for a second and there are spots of blood inside the glass dome. I wonder if the TV Network got cold feet at the prospect of what would have been a very gory scene and cut the sequence?",1110844800,2,2180,4.636363636363637
1802239,5,B000077VRT,"I am a HUGE Stephen King fan so when I saw the 1980 version directed by Kubrick and with Nicholson, I absolutely hated it. Basically it was nothing like the novel. However, when I heard of a miniseries coming to TV of The Shining my hopes were risen. When I finally saw the miniseries I came away absolutely loving it. My only problem with it was that Delbert Grady in the miniseries version was a caretaker with no family like he was in the book. Like I said though that was my only problem with the newer version. With the exception of that everything else in the miniseries was almost exactly like the book (unlike Kubrick's butchery).

Weber was just phenomenal as Jack. Weber's performance of the madness and insanity Jack eventually succumbs to being more and more gradual was how Nicholson should have played Torrence in Kubrick's version. Not played it the way he did with Torrence seeming a little crazy in personality even from the beginning (of course than again this film was made right at the end of the 70's decade where all kinds of drugs were used and Kubrick used various neon lights towards the end of his 2001: A Space Odyssey movie). In addition to Weber's gradual insane performance, the way he touched upon his love for Danny and ultimately not willing to ever hurt Danny again (like he did when he broke Danny's arm) was just very moving and touching. That human aspect of the original movie was lost where Nicholson didn't even care that his Jack Torrance was trying to kill his son, Danny.

Demornay was so much better than DuVall. Demornay is such a talented actress. The fact that she was able to pull off a perfect balance of vulnerability as well as determination and courage for the life of her son just makes her an even better actress in my eyes. DuVall's Wendy on the other hand just made you want to reach in and strangle her for constantly being so weak and wimpy.

Melvin VanPeebles and Courtland Mead who play Dick Halloran and Danny Torrance added some nice touch up's to two of the three characters (three including/counting Jack) who possess the ""shining"" as Dick calls it. Mick Garris (who also directed King's miniseries of The Stand) nicely balances the human/character aspects of this more truer miniseries with the hotel as a character itself too/as well.

If you wish to see a truly good adapatation of a Stephen King novel (not to discredit Carrie, Shawshank and Greenmile cause those were just as good) than bypass Kubrick's Shining and just rent this miniseries version directed by Mick Garris and that had King's completel input in it.",1110758400,5,2585,4.674725274725275
1802240,2,B000077VRT,"Stephen Weber and Courtland Mead are truly awful, although it's tough to be so critical of a child actor.

The biggest problem with this miniseries is that, like most King tv movies, the film lacks atmosphere. In particular, the scenes are overlit. In addition, like most King production on which he's a part, the scenes jump to much. The film lack continuity. Just when it builds up, it quickly cuts to another scene.

The only redeeming quaility is Rebecca De Mornay, although it's hard to imagine how such a lovely wife would stick with such a loser husband.

Kubric might not have adapted King's book acurately, but it was a brilliant film nonetheless. Stephen Kind should have just accepted it and forgone this movie, for it's truly awful.",1110240000,9,744,4.796875

They call it brilliant, a work of art, Jack Nicholson is referred to as thespian,perfect,a lesson in filmmaking, etc. Don't get me wrong, I love the original. It's a great movie but it's flawed too. Jack Nicholson did not give a lesson in acting. He was fun to watch but he also took it too far. The film got so adrift in a land of fantasy and symbolism that it forgot any of the reality or humanity in the characters. This movie however focuses solely on that. It rarely goes for big scares much like the original, and decides to take a more dramatic turn. It,in turn,has flaws as well. The special effects are all the can be expected from a 1997 miniseries. THe acting(with the notable exception of a surprisingly good performance from Steven Weber as Jack)is terrible. Danny will get far up on your nerves and not let go. However it gets to a more effective point of characters. They're relatable, sometimes likable, for the most part believable.

It may even make you shed a tear or two at the end.  And the acting is not horrific as half of the reviewers would like you to believe.  Steven Weber does a fantastic job and the Courtland Mead is just a typical child horror movie actor.  All of the actors are perfectly fine.

Plus this kid couldn't seem to close his mouth, I think he had a harelip or something. Plus the family kept making a joke out of ""Donner Dinner"" it just sounded dorky and dumb and they didn't do that in the book so why put that in the movie if King is so concerned about staying true to the book. The hedge animals I thought were the lamest part in the book and they were worse in the movie with the bad special effects. Please, Land of the Lost has better special effects.

1802259,5,B000077VRT,"Many people I've come across have said that ""Stanley Kubrick's The Shining"" was much better than ""The Shining the miniseries"". I beg to differ, mostly because I've read the book (it's my favorite book) and that the miniseries made in 1997 followed the book almost perfectly. I understand how many would find Kubrick's film more horrific with Jack Nicholson's crazy attitude and Shelly Duvall's Bulgy eyes; that of course, people would find far more horrific. My argument is that the book, The Shining, written by Stephen King, wasn't just a horror novel, it was about a struggle between a loving father with alcoholism trying to love his son and be what he thought was the perfect father. ""Father knows best"" right?

  My interpretation of the Kubrick film was just that a crazy, abusive man is trapped in an isolated hotel with his son with a very strange idea on who ""Tony"" is, and with a bulgy eyed wife with no love for her husband at all. No wonder Nicholson went crazy and try and kill everyone with an ax!

  I admit, Kubrick had a great unique way to approach ""The Shining"", but I just don't see how he should even call it ""The Shining!""

  ""Stephen King's The Shining the Miniseries"" made in 1997 at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado had great actors/actresses! Rebecca De Mornay portrayed the perfect blonde, loving, scared, but strong Winifred ""Wendy"" Torrance while our favorite Wings actor Steven Weber played such a sad but angry, recovering alcoholic, and loving father as John ""Jack"" Torrance.

  I find the idea of using a wiggling finger to represent ""Tony"" as an alright idea but it just doesn't follow the book! Plus, I find the interaction between Jack and Danny in the Kubrick film just didn't seem close, plus, they just didn't really interact very much, when in the book, they were supposed to have a close loving relationship trying to get past Jack's alcohol problem, which is shown in the miniseries almost perfectly. What I probably loved the most about the miniseries was the end which made me almost cry, the miniseries and the book both showed that Jack got passed his alcohol problem , passed his demons, to be able to do one more wonderful, emotional sacrifice for his son.

  The main question is: ""Are you more loyal to King or Kubrick?"" When you simply answer that question, you'll see why it's open for interpretation.

1802281,4,B000077VRT,"A careful reading of Mr. King's books will show that a loving relationship is often at their center.  ""Cujo"" is one, but ""The Shining"" is the best example.

The heart of the book, and this adaptation, is a family.  What makes the horror all the worse is that this is a family in crisis.  This is their last desperate chance to make a ""go"" of it.  Jack MUST be sucessful as the caretaker of the Overbrook.  He MUST stay sober and finish the play.  If he doesn't, his family breaks up.  You empathize with he and his family's situation:  This is what makes it transcend the ""mad slasher"" genre, where the characters are pawns.

I think this is why most people of who have read King's book dislike Kubrick's movie.  Kubrick's movie is all cold, icy and frankly, nasty.  The book and this adaptation despite the blood and gore has a warm heart.

The engine that drives this plot and characters is the strong, fierce love that exists between Danny and his father.  Danny's psychic sense tells him that the Overlook is place of horrible danger (his 'imaginary friend' Tony keeps showing him signs of this.)  His psychic sense is also telling him how important this job is to his father and his family.  Danny and his father stay at the hotel because they must to keep the family going. There is a horrible reinforcing cycle developing here.  The hotel is using Danny's psychic ablity to energize itself and drive his father to homicidal mania.  Jack at least initially, is staying in danger for Danny and his wife's sake.

This is far clearer in the book, whose narrative is from Danny's POV much of the time.  Kubrick chose to throw all of this out to concentrate on Jack's growing homicidal madness.  In this adaptation, King makes a valiant attempt to dramatize Danny's courage and loyalty to his father as the hotel transforms him into a monster.  He mostly carries it off, but I think this would be impossible for just about any child actor. This child actor is just not up to the task. Steven Weber does an incredible job of showing the agony Jack is going through as he fights off the hotel's attempts to use him to kill the family he loves.

The climatic scene of Jack's (seeming) annihilation at his own hands to save his son's life is as effective for its sentimentality as it is for its horror.

However, this take is far closer to King's intentions, from Jack's initial normalacy to Wendy's strength and beauty, to Halloran's compassion.

Steven Weber does a great turn as Jack.  He isn't a Nicolson, but then again, how could he have been?  He grounds his character in reality, so when he finally snaps, its shocking.

Rebecca DeMorney was a surprising choice as Wendy, and she is brilliant at it, especially in the quieter scenes, when she is desperately trying to keep her family together.

Courtland Mead is OK as Danny.  I wouldn't say he was particularly noteworthy, but considering how young the actor and the character was, and how much he dominated the screen time, I won't be too harsh.

On the other hand, there are a few things where the Kubrick film was superior.  The Kubrick film definitely captured the creepiness, and the Delbert Grady character was chilling.  Here, the Grady character was almost too nice.

The length of the film allowed a very subtle and emotional display of Jack Torrance's descent in to madness. The acting is also very good, especially Steven Weber's performance.
 The only problem I had with it was the fact that King terminated any question as to how much of the hauntings were only in Jack's mind. This idea is what made both the novel and the Kubrick version more interesting.

1802290,3,B000077VRT,"I recently had the opportunity to view Stephan King's screenplay version of his classic horror novel. It is mostly true to the story line in the book; however, there are some disappointing aspects of the miniseries verson in comparison to Kubrick's 1980 classic.
The music in the original was more erie, and as the movie progressed it got all the more intense as you could get the feeling that things were begining to unravel at the Overlook. I didn't feel that same effect while viewing the King version.
When you compare the part of Jack Torrance first played by Jack Nicholson then later by Weber, I find that Jack Nicholson is a far more convincing Jack Torrance. Let's face it, after starring in ""One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest"" the part of Jack Torrance was perfect for him. Perhaps I expected too much from Steven Weber(he had some really big shoes to fill after Nicholson Play the part earlier), but give Weber his due. He did a great job late in the movie battling his demons.
Rebecca DeMornay does a fine job as Wendy, and compared to the Wendy played by Shelly Duvall in the original,she comes through with a strong performance. There is much more mother-son interaction in the King version, and DeMorney plays a quite forceful character in comparison.
The hedge animals coming to life just didn't hit it in this movie. In fact, I thought it to be quite cheesy.  When I read the novel many years ago, I imagined those hedge animals to be very scary, but even the special effects were ineffective and actually comical.
The scene at the end of the film was unnecessary. The spirit of Jack coming to Danny's graduation was an add-on, it was not in the novel. I appreciated the fact that they ended the movie true to the book (the boiler), where in the original it ended with Jack in the hedge maze.

This was a great version of the book and what was best is the fact that Stephen King was able to do the film the way he wanted to. So many film adaptations of books suck so it's good to see one being told how the writer intended it to be.  The first film was remarkable and a classic horror that's become the mold of many after it. But that's not to say this version wasn't remarkable in its own right. Stephen Weber may not have Jack Nicholson's finesse but he does a wonderful job as Jack Torrence. Stephen impressed me with this role. Since the sitcom "" Wings "" I didn't expect much from him.  He proved me wrong and he'll prove you wrong too if you've prejudged this film before seeing it.
Granted this film is not as scary as the first UNTIL the end. This one was made in 97' so it relies on special effects they didn't have in 80' when the original film was made. The effects didn't bring much to the film. If it hadn't been for Weber's wonderful acting this would have been a horrible remake. I love Rebecca DeMornay but didn't buy her as Wendy at all. She is a better actress than Shelley Devall on any day, but Rebecca just wasn't this character.  The little boy that played Doc was cute but unconvincing.  The first little boy was more charming and made the part of Danny his own.
I would definitely say give this a chance especially if you liked the first film. Watch it just to compare it to the other versions. This may not be in the calibur of the first but it is definitely not far behind.  Give it a chance and hold onto your seats for some hair-rising thrills and chills.",1082678400,4,1658,4.231012658227848
1802292,3,B000077VRT,"1980, Stanley Kubrick adapts Stephen King's novel ""The Shining"" and makes movie history. Although he changed it drastically, it was well recieved and remebered for it's slow and creepy pacing. Now, in 1997 we got an updated miniseries version of the same novel, this time screen-written by King himself and made for TV. The result, a different movie experience entirely. This version follows King's original story I am told to a hair. Its several hours longer providing enough time to cover every aspect of the book unlike Kubrick's version. It is strange watching the series and not seeing Nicholson as Jack but the new updated actor filled the part suprisingly well. By the third part he had truly grown into the part and was fully developed and dimensional unlike Nicholson who was just plain out crazy with no simpathy or remorse shown. The part in the miniseries when Jack tells Danny to run away from him always gives me chills. A few thigns however that brutally hurt the miniseries include the actor of Danny (who is a joke) and the poorly animated animal shrubs (it sounds stupid already.) Aside from those two flaws, the updated miniseries is an entertaining watch and should be viewed by any fan of the 1980 version. An intersting side note, writer Stephen King makes a small (and corny appearance) as an orchestra conductor and infamous writer/director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead trilogy, Spider-Man) makes a small cameo as a man who gives the cook directions to the Overlook Hotel in part 3. Well, thats it for now. Enjoy.",1082419200,,1529,4.8396946564885495
1802293,5,B000077VRT,"It isn't fair for critics to compare this version of Stephen King's ""The Shining"" to the Jack Nicholson film, because they're two completely different versions that are brilliant in their own ways.  This version of the movie is much longer than the Nicholson version, and for fans of King's novel, this will probably be the film adaptation that you prefer simply because it follows the book so closely.  Steven Weber plays the role of Jack much differently than Nicholson did: like in the novel, the character's maddness is slow to build, but when the film reaches its climax, Weber is absolutely terrifying.  Rebecca De Mornay gives the performance of her career as Wendy, a woman who is desperately trying to keep her family together and is slowly coming to realize the horror that has possessed her husband.  They young actor who plays Danny gives a chilling performance, and he always gives me the creeps when I watch the film (I can only assume that's because the kid's a great actor, hopefully not because he's a freak in real life).  The film builds and builds, and there are a lot of suspenseful moments.  The scene with Danny in the snow where the bushes come to life is probably my favorite scene in the film, and it's especially enjoyable because it was omitted from the Nicholson version entirely.

1802298,4,B000077VRT,"I recently bought this movie on DVD, just after finishing the great book. I had seen the Kubrick version long before I read the book, and always thought of it as a masterpiece. Although entirely altered from the book, Kubrick's version still stands as my all-time favorite horror film.
Apparently, Stephen King held a 17-year long grudge against the 1980 version because it was so much different than his book. So finally, he decided to do a faithful adaption of his book...this being the result. It was created as a miniseries for ABC, so most of the bad language and sex from the book was cut out, however, I was surprised at how much violence they allowed (especially considering that ABC is owned by Diney.) Overall, I was pleased by this 4 1/2 hour adaption of the book...the following are a list of things I liked and didn't like about the film:

PROS:
Very faithful adaptation of the book
Steven Weber did a great job
The hedge animals were included in the film
Gives much more background on the Overlook and the dead things that lurk inside
Gives more background on the Torrance family
It is very nicely updated
Jack's desent into insanity was much more gradual

CONS:
I felt that King was trying too hard to avoid connections to the Kubrick version
At times, the film felt too glossy
The man in the dog costume wasn't as odd and gruesome as he was in the book
Doesn't maintain the dreadful atmosphere of the Kubrick version
The hotel was better in the Kubrick version
The scene in which the clock begins to squirt bloody tissue and brains all over the glass was left out...which was very symbolic to me
At times, I found Courtland Mead's upper lip to be somewhat distracting
The special effetcs were over-used just a bit
The obvious ""commercial breaks"" became annoying

If someone asked me which version they should see, I would have to reccomend the Kubrick version because I believe that it is truly frightening (and a lot shorter running time to handle.) However, I would not hesitate to reccomend this version to those who love the book or just want to see a really good TV miniseries.",1070841600,4,2098,4.619302949061662

Steve ""Wings"" Weber is good as King's Jack, slowly losing control and getting more and more obsessed with the hotel. Rebecca De Mornay, that ageless goddess of an actress, is far and above Shelly Duvall's version of Wendy. And Melvin Van Peebles gives a slick Scatman-worthy performance as Dick Halloran (loved that suit). But the young actors who played Danny and Tony left a lot to be desired (like personality).
Overall it's a very good movie. I just wish Stephen King would stop giving all his miniseries to Mick ""Yawn"" Garris who's versions of King novels always seem slack.
By the way, what's with the widescreen bars. This was a full screen movie! It's like watching tv with partial blinders on.",1069459200,,936,4.8930817610062896

Like most King fans, I shrugged it off and hoped that one day somebody would do a King book as a film that worked...to me, this mini-series fulfilled that wish.
Most reviewers like to pit Kubrick vs. Mini-Series, but I think that is not the best approach to describe the difference between the two movies.  If you never read the book ""The Shining"" (or did not like it, which makes me wonder why you'd watch the movie), chances are the Kubrick movie will be an utterly satisfying experience.

The charactors in this version are so much more developed and believably realistic.
Steven Weber's Jack Torrence is a normal guy that is trying hard to deal with his alcoholism and anger, and also keep his family together, while at the same time being slowly consumed by the forces of the Overlook Hotel. He is much more that just a babbling Psycho.
Rebecca De Mornay's Wendy is a more believable, strong wife also struggling to maintain her marriage and protect her son. This is definitely not the whimpering and submissive Wendy of the Kubrick version.
I rcommend this film to any fan of Stephen King. This DVD makes a great addition to any good horror library.

1802304,5,B000077VRT,"The broad canvas of the mini-series has been good to King. Where a 90-minute theatrical run-time often proves confining, the extravagant length of a mini-series allows King to spread out, imparting the feel of one of his novels. Like guests at the Overlook Hotel on extended holiday, we get to stay for a while. We get to settle in. And the atmosphere...settles into us. The feel of a King novel has much to do with creating a good ""build"". King is king of the slow-burner. He takes his time. He creates a world. He ""peoples"" it. We get to know these folks, mostly through dialogue, and (in his better works) we take a shining to them, pardon the pun. And while King maintains that his process is just about telling a story, and that he's not consciously pushing themes, nevertheless, themes come out. In this one, we're treated to a haunted house story, and then...like the malevolence that inhabits The Overlook...the themes ooze out. Alcoholism. The suffering of a family. Duality. A man's need to prove and redeem himself. The cycle of violence - sins of the father, and all that. But also, in a moving way, the familial love that overcomes. It's all in there, and it makes what is on the surface level just an effective spook yarn, something more - a meditation on human relationships. Perhaps even a love story, in its own way.

Kubrik vs. Garris? Whatever. I don't like comparing these films, just like I don't like pitting Batman 1966 against Nolan's Dark Knight. We have the base material and two different filmic expressions. Get over it. If you can go along for this ride, good for you.

If anyone objects I shall cite Maximum Overdrive, Sleepwalkers and The Shining mini-series.  Although ostensibly an attempt to recreate the novel, SKTS ignores some vital aspects of the book for the sake of Hollywood appeal.
The series begins with Jack talking with acting has-been Elliot Gould, doing what amounts to an extended commercial for AA.  Now the Jack of the book was too stubborn to seek help, he tried to quit drinking on his own, a major factor in his breakdown.  But AA is politically correct, and in Hollywood PC is, ya know, good.
Soon we meet Jack's wife, Wendy.  Now the Wendy of the book was a plain Jane with self-esteem issues.  She stayed with Jack, even when she feared him, because she was afraid of being alone.  In SKTS, however, Wendy is a beautiful, strong woman who can take care of herself.  Why would such a woman stay with a man like Jack?  Who knows, but strong, beautiful women are politically correct, and Hollywood says if its PC it's, ya' know, good.
Soon we meet Danny, and Tony.  The kid who plays Danny doesn't just need acting lessons, but speech lessons.  His garbled lines are barely intelligeble.  As for Tony, he hovers over Danny giving lofty advice and directions like some kind of guardian angel.  In the book and the Kubrik film, Tony was an unseen presence, as fit his role.  Why was he made so ridiculously blatant in SKTS?  Because in 1997 angels were a fad, and as Hollywood knows, fads are, ya' know, good.
Some reviewers have lauded how SKTS crammed in every little bit of miutia from the book.  Yes this was done, from the important details (Jack's special relationship with Danny) to the extraneous (the hornet's nest) and the silly (the killer bushes).  But, so what?  The foundation of the movie was ruined, making everything that happened afterwards irrelavent!  The bottom line is SKTS is not a true work of King, it is a work of Hollywood, and as far as horror movies go, Hollywood is, ya' know, bad.",1059091200,20,2114,4.589333333333333
1802308,5,B000077VRT,"I was sorry to learn that folks in certain parts of the world had to wait so long for this version of The Shining to be released to VHS and DVD. And, I can't help but wonder just what Mr Kubrick was so worried about that he took so long to allow Stephen King the right do his own version of the book. Then, you only have to watch the two films (after reading the book), and all questions are answered.
Don't mistake me - I greatly enjoyed Kubrick's interpretation of The Shining. Particularly Danny's encounters with the ghosts of the previous caretaker's creepy daughters.
It's unfortunate in some ways that Kubrick's version was only minutely faithful to the original story. Most of it was pure fabrication on his part. Still, perhaps that's a blessing. It just emphasises even more how wonderful and refreshing it was to see Stephen King's adaption.
There are plenty of points for comparison to prove how much better the latter version is, and I'm not talking about special effects here. The wall of blood crashing down through the hallway well and truly scared me the first time I saw it, and I had to freeze-frame the VCR to get a good look at the massacred images of the two little girls.
However...Firstly, it was totally refreshing to see Tony portrayed as a proper character, rather than Danny Lloyd pretending that his finger was talking to him. And Courtland Mead's performances each time Danny went into a self-induced trance were riveting - especially the very first one of the movie. The revelation that Tony was really just a representation of Danny's older self was also a nice touch. It also makes sense - it would be far less threatening to Danny's sanity to think that the apparition appearing to him to warn him of danger was someone else entirely, rather than an older version of himself.
Further, Courtland Mead's all-round performance and portrayal of Danny Torrance was spot on. He is so convincing in the way he portrays a scared little boy who doesn't always know what is the right thing to do. His defiance in trying to prove he isn't frightened of the apparitions the hotel is producing is very believable, and his love for (and fear of) his father is even more so. And, his confusion about his awesome gifts is powerfully realistic.
For example, his reaction when Dick Halloran reassures him that, should there be any trouble, all he needs to do is call out with his mind, is highly emotional. He gives a strong impression of a child who, knowing he is in a potentially terrifying situation, has just seen the light at the end of a very black tunnel.
Rebecca DeMornay is wonderful as Wendy Torrance. She so accurately portrayed a loving wife and mother who is still recovering from the horror of living with a violent alcoholic. Her apprehension around Jack - particularly where Danny is involved - is all too real. She does a magnificent job of playing a woman who, while loving her husband dearly and trying to help him all she can, is still frightened of him, at least on a subconscious level.
Unlike Shelley Duvall in Kubrick's version, DeMornay does not present a Wendy Torrance who is feeble and pathetic, and to be pitied. Rather, her Wendy Torrance is a woman to be admired, and respected. The fight she puts up against Jack towards the end of the film is strongly indicative of this. Where I recall Duvall cowering in a corner and screaming hysterically (okay, I admit I'd probably do that myself in a similar situation), DeMornay's Wendy shows strength of character to put up a fight, even though physically harming her husband obviously galled her a great deal.
As for Steven Weber... Words fail to fully describe the incredible performance given by this actor. The whole story of The Shining was supposed to revolve around the family relationship of the Torrances, with focus primarily on Jack and Danny as the Overlook's main targets. Steven Weber was truly brilliant as a man constantly teetering on the brink of oblivion, struggling to maintain his dignity and self-respect as a husband and father in the wake of a life wasted on alcohol abuse.
It was chilling to watch Jack's gradual descent into madness, as portrayed by Weber. It was a stark contrast to the sulky, sullen presence of Jack Nicholson throughout Kubrick's version. Although I agree that Nicholson is brilliant as an actor, I also agree with another reviewer. Nicholson was the wrong choice for the role of Jack Torrance. Right from the start, he gave the impression that he'd already lost his mind, and was spending the entire film just waiting for the right moment to grab the axe and go beserk.
Weber's performance was far more subtle than that of Nicholson. Perhaps more time to explore the personality of Jack Torrance might have had something to do with this, but I also believe that King deserves much credit for producing a screenplay that allowed for it.
Although I knew exactly what was going to happen, I still sat through the entire thing hoping that Jack would come to his senses, realise what was going on, and get himself and his family out of there. Of course, that was never going to happen, but I think it was wonderful that the film was able to draw those sorts of emotions from the viewer.
I think that is the thing that really sets Stephen King's version apart from Stanley Kubrick's. With Kubrick's version, you are merely an observer. There's no effort to really draw the viewer in. It gives a few chills and thrills, but there is no real emotion. King's screenplay draws you in right from the beginning, and holds you right until the final scenes.
Though Stanley Kubrick's film was fine in its own right, it is not, and never will be a patch on Stephen King's magnificent adaption.
And, for the record, there was nothing corny about the ending. It was a nice touch that Jack was redeemed right at the end, and his brief appearance at Danny's graduation was nothing short of heartwarming. It was also a nice touch to add the image of the sign promising to rebuild the Overlook - though God-willing no one will ever commit the travesty of making a sequel.",1057449600,8,6087,4.67910447761194
1802309,5,B000077VRT,"I have long been a fan of Stephen King's work, and this version of The Shining is vastly superior to Stanley Kubrick's film.  Steven Weber is excellent as Jack Torrance, the recovering alcoholic who moves with his wife and son to the Overlook Hotel in Colorado for the winter, and who soon finds himself possessed by the hotel's ghosts.  Rebecca DeMornay's performance as Wendy Torrance was much better than that of Shelley Duvall in the Kubrick version; Duvall played Wendy as a much weaker character, while DeMornay played her as the strong, fiercely protective mother that she was in the book.  Courtland Mead as Danny Torrance was simply terrific--he was far less stiff and wooden than Danny Lloyd in Kubrick's version, and he showed far more range of emotion than Lloyd did.
The best surprise of this version was Melvin Van Peebles as Dick Hallorann, the Overlook's cook and the only other person who has any real understanding of ""the shining"" besides Danny himself.  I see his portrayal of Hallorann as a tribute to the late Scatman Crothers, who so ably portrayed the character in the Kubrick version, and whose death was a great loss to acting.  Melvin played Hallorann with the same charm and grace that Scatman Crothers did, but with a uniqueness that made the role all his own.
The extras on the DVD were pretty good, too; I got a kick out of hearing the commentary from King, Weber, and Mick Garris, and the deleted scenes with the Garris commentary were pretty interesting as well.  I was sort of disappointed that they didn't include a ""Making Of"" featurette like they did with The Stand, but I don't see that as a reason to give this DVD a lower rating than I did.

Not to say that Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining was bad, it's just that it's great to see different versions and a version that is true to the book. Kubrick's version was pure psychological horror, where this one is pure haunted house horror.
The movie is about a family that go up in the mountains of Colorado. The father is the caretaker for the Overlook Hotel for the winter season, which has a bad history of murder and corruption. As the movie progresses we see the hotel starting to take affect in Jack Torrance's life (played by Steven Weber, but not as good as Jack Nicholson), making him see the ghosts of the Overlook Hotel. The ghosts want Jack's son, Danny, who has The Shining. The ghosts are basically using Jack to gain support of this strong boy with his strong powers. The movie is not as scary as Kubrick's version, but you still get a sense of eerie hauntings. But, I have to admit, when Steven Weber wacks down the door with the croquet mallet, that would scare ...me if I was Wendy in that bathroom. So, if you read the novel then you will probably enjoy this version of The Shining and then compare the two. It's a fun movie with interesting sequences and material in it.

1802311,5,B000077VRT,"I enjoyed this miniseries immensely, largely due to the fact--as has been brought out in the reviews by at least one other individual--that it followed the original novel by Stephen King.  Now, I always enjoyed Kubrick's version of the story, but I could never help being disappointed by the fact that so much of the book just didn't figure in it.  Also, as much as I like and admire Jack Nicholson--and he is certainly entertaining to watch in the Kubrick film--he was wrong for the part of Jack Torrance.
I think that what made me enjoy this remake so much is the HEART and EMOTION that exists within it, as opposed to Kubrick's cold, intellectual take.  Many scenes between the three members of the family (played by Steven Weber, Rebecca DeMornay, and young Courtland Meade) actually brought tears to my eyes.  And no, the ending was not cheap--it was extremely moving.
As for the rest of the content--everything is extremely well-acted and well-done.  For me, of course, the standout performance was that of Steven Weber.  After seeing this, I am full of admiration for him, and Mr. Weber, if you ever read this review, I want you to know that you were BRILLIANT as Jack Torrance.  You played this role as it was written by Stephen King, both in the novel and in the screenplay.  You made him alternately touching, tragic, humorous, and likeable almost throughout, in spite of a few terrifying moments.  So, thanks for the great work--as a result of this, I will be looking up your other films and following your future performances.
As for potential viewers, don't, of course, discount the original version by Stanley Kubrick--it is most definitely worth seeing.  But for me, this is the definitive version of ""The Shining"".",1054512000,4,1730,4.8141891891891895
1802312,5,B000077VRT,"Anyone who blindly says Kubrick's version is ""better"", needs to take a couple days and read the book. Poor Stanley went for shocks as opposed to that whole road of characterization.
Is this version THE ""Shining"" to see? No. See them both. Kubrick's most memorable moments aren't found in the book or this version (although, I do prefer Stephen Weber's line in place of Jack's ""Here's Johnny""). No elevator blood, no twins (even though they were in the book; Grady is childless here), no ""All work and no play"".
What's present with the miniseries is the story. Suffice to say, Jack Torrance was not a weird little guy to begin with. He did not just have a mental breakdown, as Kubrick tried to hint. There's a lot of build up and foreshadowing (the wasp nest, for instance) that was lost in the film version. Jack is a tragic character, a pawn in a battle of supernatural forces. The infamous axe has been dropped in place of its rightful predecessor, the roque (Denver croquet here) mallet. And even with four hours to ""fill"", some bits and pieces were lost.
Jack Nicholson versus Stephen Weber: no contest, right? Wrong. Weber gives ol' Wolf-Grin a run for his money, but what brings Jack back to the top is that when Torrance does lose it, Nicholson is more convincing. The Dick Halloran here is great, but Scatman Crothers seemed more like Dick to me. The rest of the ""new"" cast is an improvement. Rebecca De Morney is a perfect Wendy, far better from Shelly Duvall's homely, helpless portrayal. The new Danny has a lisp, but it's better than hearing him croak around with his finger saying ""redrum"".
I again prefer this version for its ending. The Kubrick version is soulless and mundane. This ending is touching and has heart. I won't give anything away, but King has added a ""Ten Years Later"" epilogue not present in the book and it works beautifully. If only Dreamcatcher could've been adapted this well.",1053388800,4,1911,4.690476190476191
1802313,5,B000077VRT,"Alrighty folks... Let's make this clear right off the bat.  Kubrick's was an interpretation.  Nothing more.  It had a few moments, but other than that, it was a C film.  Period.  Every body says that Jack N's acting was amazing and over the top, and that's all fine and dandy, but it relied on sight scares.  King's rendition delves into the psychological terrors experienced inside the Overlook, and plays not on the fears of the eye, but the fears of the mind-the unseen.  It is not simply an excellent film because it follows the book, rather it unravels the characters and the history of the hotel as never before, giving motives and flaws to its characters, not simply being crazy.  It is more about the struggle to remain a family than a man going nuts and trying to kill that family.  In conclusion, best horror film ever (well, at least top 10).",1052352000,10,853,4.559210526315789
1802314,4,B000077VRT,"This version very closely follows King's intent and storyline.  In the novel, Jack Torrance DID NOT freeze to death in the maze like the Kubrick/Nicholson version but DID die when the boiler-room blew up, which is exactly what this newer version shows, correctly.  Plus, Jack Torrance DID carry around a croquet mallet towards the end, not an axe, like the Kubrick version falsely showed.  Finally, Jack Torrance DID NOT say ""Here's Johnny"", no matter how good Nicholson did it in the Kubrick version.
Whenever one tries to make a movie or mini-series out of a novel, they should keep as close to the original storyline, and thus, the author's intent, as possible.  Therefore, I'll take this 4 hour Stephen King certified version over the 2 hour 20 min Kubrick version any day.

It made me run out and purchase the book, because it had to be better than this lousy excuse for a movie. And I was right. It is, without question, the most terrifying novel I have ever read. No longer did I dismiss the film as just another bad Kubrick film (and let's face it, he made quite a few); I now saw it as an abomination.

Second the cast is second rate compared to the first, not to say they can't act becuase they are all fine actors, they just didn't fit the roles.

1802317,3,B000077VRT,"For a decade, Stephen King made absolutely no secret of his loathing for Stanley Kubrick's famous and controversial 1980 adaptation of King's now-classic third novel.  Yet all King could do throughout the 1980s was talk - Kubrick owned the rights to the story until the mid-1990s.  Around 1995, Kubrick's option expired, and he agreed to permit Stephen King to produce a new teleplay of The Shining if King would agree to (1) cease bad-mouthing Kubrick's film in public; and (2) delay the release of the finished product on video/DVD in North America for five years after the initial airdate - this explains why this miniseries was only just released in the United States even though it aired on the Sci-Fi network some years ago.  Well, Stephen King is listed as both the writer and executive producer of this excruciatingly long and boring miniseries, and he should accept the blame for its mediocrity.  King's chief objection to Kubrick's film was its significant departures from the novel's storyline.  Now, those of us who find King's tale of Jack, Danny and Wendy Torrance's suffering thanks to the Overlook Hotel to be deeply moving have a chance to compare the two versions ourselves.  I am afraid that Stanley Kubrick's film - flawed though it is - will remain the definitive production of the story.  Indeed, watching the Kubrick and King versions back-to-back is an enriching experience, as it allows viewers to really see for themselves the difference between a great masterpiece and derivative hackwork.  There are many positive elements in ""Stephen King's The Shining"" - chiefly the sensitive performance of Rebecca de Mornay as Wendy.  De Mornay earns her salary here, as she is the only member of the cast who brings any depth and emotion to her role.  Stephen Weber is no more than adequate as Jack Torrance, and by the final two hours of the film, he winds up giving quite a credible Jack Nicholson imitation, creating the eerie sensation that we are watching Weber playing Jack Torrance AS Jack-Nicholson.  Blaxploitation superstar Melvin Van Peebles turns Dick Hallorann into a sentimental cliche, and Elliot Gould's brief turn as the vacuous Mr. Ullmann cannot hold a candle to the unsung Barry Nelson's witty interpretation of the same part 17 years earlier.  The less said about the acting ""talents"" of young Courtland Mead (Danny Torrance), the better.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment in the miniseries is the Overlook Hotel itself.  In this small-screen Overlook, objects materialize, doors shut on their own, voices whisper at odd moments, and none of it is in the least bit frightening.  The overwhelming sense of dread and danger around every corner which creates such enormous tension in Kubrick's version is totally absent - this Overlook seems like a suburban house gone bad rather than a mysterious, malevolent time warp.  Director Mike Garris brings not even the hint of an original sensibility to the material, being content merely to film King's novel in a near-exact literal fashion.  Yet Garris' non-engagement with the story is not just a matter of script content - as a director, he has no sense whatsoever of dramatic pace or timing, nor is he capable of composing an interesting image.  Unlike Kubrick's Overlook (surely one of the great sets in the history of motion pictures), Garris' hotel is devoid of atmosphere, and all the ghostly shrieking and telekenetics in the world can't change the fact that we never believe for one second that the hotel is really haunted, because we have seen all of these tired Gothic shocks in a million lesser productions.  Also, the moving hedge animals (one of King's pet peeves about Kubrick's film was its substitution of a maze for the hedge animals) prove to be totally ridiculous when realized onscreen - nothing in the world can make a leafy bunny frightening!  Strangely, the miniseries contains several moments which seem to have been lifted straight from the Kubrick version rather than the novel - the experienced viewer will spot them here and there.  Garris' actors try mightily to overcome the glop and tedium around them, but with the exception of De Mornay and to some extent, Weber, they fail altogether.  In addition, King's teleplay ruins the entire story by adding a final sequence not found in either his own book or in Kubrick's film - Jack Torrance makes a ghostly appearance at Danny's high-school graduation years after the Overlook destroys him.  The scene is preposterous, self-indulgent, and reeks of cheap sentiment.  I give the entire production three stars because as a whole it isn't really bad - just mediocre.  Still, film buffs owe it to themselves to try and sit through the massive bulk of this thing, even if only to say - ""I thought so - Stanley Kubrick's version is much better after all!""",1050451200,8,4810,4.975031210986267

1802319,5,B000077VRT,"I bought this DVD out of sheer boredom and found it absolutely riveting, truly one of the best small screen films I've ever seen, genuinely frightening at a number of points, and a much more interesting story that the 1980 film. The Kubrick ""original"" was fine, great fun, and Jack Nicholson is, well, Jack Nicholson! But side by side this 1997 edition is superior in almost every way. First, Jack's performance was over the top and Shelly Duvall was horribly miscast, a cartoon character. Secondly, while Kubrick's cinematographic sense was as always exquisite and haunting, his storytelling abilities were often suspect. King's version of his own story draws you much, MUCH deeper into the tale. You quickly find yourself a silent guest in the hotel....
Weber's performance is perhaps less wildly entertaining but more effective in its subtle shift into madness. All the support cast are excellent, but the shining star (sorry) is Rebecca DeMornay, who plays a strong, intelligent, forceful woman who you really pull for when the going gets tough. A great, multi-layered performance - a sensual, bright woman who loves her husband but regrets the absence of passion in their relationship, a wife who struggles to maintain a positive attitude as she faces the dispair of a disfunctional mate and a bleak low rent future, and a mother who adores her child but is in awe and fear of his powers.... all played by a strikingly beautiful actress who is moving into more mature roles with grace and style.
Production values are just as high as in the Kubrick version. The look of the film is rich and textured, you can feel how empty this hotel is, you can hear floorboards creaking under your feet. Even the 11 deleted scenes are excellent.
Buy this DVD, turn out the lights on a rainy night, curl up with someone you love, take the phone off the hook and gently allow yourself to get creeped out. Really a fine, fine piece of work.",1049155200,5,1928,4.792792792792793
1802320,3,B000077VRT,"Stephen King is a genius. His imagination is so crystal clear, so vivid, so intense that most of us would probably agree, the guy is simply a genius.
This film version of The Shining made me realize more than any other movie I've ever watched that the medium of film is a living, breathing, collaborative form. I think Stephen King was stunned by Stanley Kubrick's original lack of reverence for his early horror masterpiece, and it festered in his mind for so many years he finally got enough money together (some 21 million dollars), hired a director *he* wanted (and had worked with on The Stand), executive produced, chose actors he liked, fought with ABC over what could and couldn't be shown on television, wrestled with censors, et cetera, et cetera. Essentially, King said to himself ""I know what I want to see in a movie version of The Shining. I know what audiences like. And I have the power to do it!""
Unfortunately, the medium of film is an entity in and of itself and it works at its peak form when it is a collaborative effort and when the people involved in the collaboration aren't all genuflecting to the will of one person. That's what creates tension behind the text, so to speak. And it's what really gives movies a pulse.
This version of The Shining lacks that tension. Steven Weber states very plainly in the commentary section ""I want to be superficially likable"" and goes on to say that he doesn't like to submerge himself in a character because it causes him to have panic attacks. He says he ""respects"" actors who *can* submerge themselves that way, but it is simply something he'd rather not do.
The problem is Weber is the lead actor in this movie. He kind'a sets the tone for the other actors on the set. And the result is a ho-hum version of The Shining -- which, ironically is *not* what Stephen King is all about; he's anything but a ho-hum writer!
I'm a young writer (see my ""about you"" area for a link to my web site) and Lord knows I have dreams about one of my novels being turned into a movie. Hell, I have dreams about them *being published* but the lesson I think I've learned from Kubrick's version, this version, and the original novel by Stephen King is that for a movie adaptation to really stand on its own, the original writer (like a parent letting a kid just be a kid) has to let the movie just be itself, for better or for worse, offering as much input as director and actors ask for, but to realize that like a kid, it has to grow up -- sometimes shaggy haired, sometimes too clean-cut, but ultimately at its best when the novelist stands back and lets the movie be just that. The movie.

STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING displays all of that and most of the memorable scenes from the novel as well.

Stephen King also has a guest appearance in the film as the conductor of the ghost band. I really didn't like Kubrick's version of THE SHINING, it strayed too far from the material it was based upon and even on its own merits as a film and story it was so bizarre that it didn't make much sense. STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING is the opposite, the story is clear and easy to follow. I also found Danny to be a much more believable child in this version than in Kubrick's.

Jack Nicholson did a great job in the 1980 version (worthy of an Academy Award) and so did Stephen Weber.  Stephen seemed to bring the story to life with his funny comments and great acting.

""The Shining,"" a 1997 ABC miniseries is no exception, and possibly one of the best King adaptations so far. If a 4 and a half hour movie is watched in one sitting and feels like 2 hours, then it must be good. And ""The Shining"" is definitely good. Steven Webber, Rebecca De Mornay and Courtland Mead are superb in their roles as the Torrance family, an Elliot Gould has a fun cameo as the manager of the Overlook Hotel. A more faithful adaptation of the King novel than the 1980 Kubrick film, I cannot say which is better because they both have their redeeming qualities, and they are both equally fascinating. Steven Webber is no Jack Nicholson, but he gives such a chilling performance. I believed him as Jack Torrance, and frankly, I was freaked out. Weber convincingly humanizes his character, and wonderfully conveys all of the conflicts that are brewing up inside him--his struggle with alcoholism, the desperate need to be a good father since he didn't have one, and his desire to succeed in life despite his father's criticism. De Mornay is perhaps a better Wendy than Shelley Duvall ever was, but Courtland Mead (although good) cannot compare to the performance of Danny Lloyd as the original Danny. I did like many aspects of this version better--the fleshed out characters, delving into the hotel's past (and its haunting), and of course, the hedge animals and wasp nest, which made great additions to the story (I'm sure they were in the book). Of course, the sappy ending to this version doesn't work very well, and the running time becomes a bit tedious toward the end, but overall, the movie is great, all the more due to Webber being so convincingly chilling when he starts to slowly go insane.

Yet, today, it's hailed as a hallmark of horror cinema and a Film Master's under-appreciated masterpiece.

That said, the Kubrick film is better in terms of sheer filmmaking - when Kubrick was on, he was really, really good, and it shows in his version of this story. Sadly, that fact is often missed by the legions of fans who get so caught up in ""it's not like the book""-itis that they don't enjoy the film for what it is. Jack Nicholson is a far better actor than Steven Weber, and it shows.
The miniseries, however, has one HUGE advantage - with a total of nearly 8 hours of ""movie"" to work with, they were able to keep the storyline virtually untouched. Although I am typically not a believer - there are just not very many movies made from novels that even remotely resemble their original source material ( ""Exit To Eden,"" originally an erotic novel by Anne Rice, turned into a Dan Aykroyd comedy, just LEAPS to mind for some reason...) - this movie is as close to a perfect conversion of a novel as I've seen.
The creepy moments are really, really creepy - the scene with topiary animals moving closer every time the camera pans away absolutely makes your skin crawl, even if you're prepared for it. Although Steven Weber isn't Jack Nicholson, the character he's playing isn't a ""Jack"" kind of guy - and Weber fills the role admirably, even though occasionally the touching family scenes teeter RIGHT on the edge of being maudlin.
If you have the patience for it, which I notice at least one other viewer didn't, this is in fact an excellent film. Just don't consider this and the Stanley Kubrick movie to be different versions of the same story - they're not, and the comparison will make both films suffer. You're better off to enjoy them both as distinct, separate entities, with very different agendas.
Oh, and do NOT turn your back on any hedge lions.

1802339,1,B000077VRT,"Uggh.  You've got to be kidding.  This movie more closely followed the original book... So what, it fails.  Kubrick's movie was written, directed and acted with the knowledge that S. King needs to be edited, A LOT, before he stuff is ready for the camera.  This movie, like The Stand, fails because the producers didn't have the sense to slice, pare, and whittle King's work down to a managable form that works.  Books are a great medium for authors like King because you can wind, meander, and stroll through concepts at your leisure and the fluff is not so obvious.  In a movie, you've got to cut out all the ancillary-related stuff and get to the point.  This movie fails to do just that.  Stick to the Kubrick movie or read the book for the ""purist"" view of this work, but, at all costs, avoid this bloated corpse of a flick.",1042502400,8,829,4.443708609271523
1802344,4,B000077VRT,"the woman in the tub scene is definitely one of the most frightening experiences i've ever been privy to while watching a film. it scared the living heck out of me! too disturbing..
overall, a greatly enjoyable flick, and highly scary at times. the main issue i have with this film is the kid. he's got to be one of the most annoying child actors out there, i'm sorry. and his acting was laughable. mainly the reason i give this 4 stars instead of 5, since they could have certainly cast a better suitor for the role. highly worth watching though....definitely recommend.",1042502400,2,571,4.607843137254902
1802345,5,B000077VRT,"When this first premeired on ABC I was captivated by it. I saw the Kubrick version after reading the book and I was disgusted with the way Kubrick had butchered one of Stephen King's best works. So naturally I was interested in the mini-series. It didn't disappoint. Like the book, this movie strives for more psychological horror as opposed to an all out gore-fest. There are no ridiculous scenes of blood rushing down the halls or a silly and contrived lawn maze as in Kubrick's version. Rather than weilding an axe, Jack instead uses an enlarged croquet mallet. His stalking through the hotel floors while slamming the bloody mallet against the walls is far more scary.
The most important difference and advantage that this version has over Kubrick's is the fact that it fully displays the struggle that Jack goes through throughout the movie and maintains that emotional hook that is so common in almost all of King's books. Jack loved his family. Thats what it all boils down to. Try and gather that from the Kubrick movie.
If you like a gorefilled shock-fest try the Kubrick version, but if you want a more psychological thriller with an emotional twist that stays true to it's roots then watch this one.",1042416000,7,1210,4.766666666666667
1802346,5,B000077VRT,"The only version of this miniseries I had was one I taped from its original TV broadcast back in 1997.  I missed parts of it because my new baby (at that time) was sick and fussy.  I caught these parts upon re-viewing, but I actually missed the last ten minutes of the movie, because my VCR ran out of tape!
  Anyway, I thought this was a far-superior version of the book and holds up better in every way than the Kubrick theatrical release.  I was surprised at the skill and depth that Steven Webber brought to the role of Jack Torrance.  I also feel (as a prior reviewer has mentioned) that the woman-in-the-bathtub scene is one of the scariest I've seen on any screen, in a theater or on TV.  Just the whole look and feel of this miniseries is far superior than the movie and clearly follows King's original vision much better.
  I was never able to see the last ten minutes (I don't think this was ever released on video; if so, I couldn't locate it).  I have hoped for a DVD version for quite some time.
  If you've never seen this miniseries, you've never seen a good, faithful adaptation of Stephen King's ""The Shining"".",1042416000,5,1127,4.391304347826087
1802347,5,B000077VRT,"Having been an avid Stephen King fan for as long as I could remember, I was thrilled to see a portrayal of ""The Shining"" that was true to the book.  Kubricks vision, while decent, was nothing like King had it in the novel.  It just seemed that Kubrick just added random bits and pieces in there to amuse himself.  The mini-series was far better than the Kubrick version as it follows the book.  The acting is great in the film and granted, there is no Jack, it's pretty unfair to compare Steven Weber with Nicholson as they are two totally different actors.  Jack did a good job with the character in the film (who i guess you could call Jack Torrance, but wasn't really like Jack in the book), but Weber does an amazing job as Jack Torrance.  You see him progressively get taken by the hotel whereas in the Kubrick version, you know Nicholson wasn't quite right before they even get to the Overlook.  In closing, there will always be that group of people who say that the Kubrick version is better, but those are obviously ones who haven't read the book.  If you enjoyed the novel, then you'll definately love this version of the film.  It's Stephen Kings' vision of what he wanted on screen.  Enjoy!  cheers!!",1042243200,13,1211,4.4840182648401825
1802348,4,B000077VRT,"To be honest, I loved both, King's and Kubrick's versions of this movie.  Ofcourse, King's version followed the story line of his book much closer than Kubrick, however, Kubrick didn't write the book, and in my opinion, he had every right to tell the story as he wanted. Jack Nicholson is perfect for the part, in Kubrick's version, the same as Steven Weber was great in the King version.  Nicholson was crazy from the start, and Webber was wacko after he drank and saw a few ghosts.  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat in both versions.. but this version is definately better than the first!",1041984000,3,599,4.477064220183486

Stale acting and unbelievable situations are all you'll get out of this movie, trust me, see Kubrick's or none.  This movie is STUPID.",1041897600,10,322,4.714285714285714
1802350,5,B000077VRT,"Anyone who would put this movie down over the Kubrick version should have their head examined, or at the very least read the book, for it is there that the truth comes out, Kubrick's version is a butchery of one of Stephen Kings most personal tales.  Stephen King finally did right by doing it himself.  Yes, Kubrick was a great director, and yes Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time, but the book was thrown out when they made that movie.",1041897600,3,454,4.392857142857143
1802351,2,B000077VRT,"This is direly hamstrung by the network's prurience over bad language or violence. Rebecca De Mornay's Wendy is more like a post-feminist 90s female crusader than a teacher's wife, a scripting decision patently done 'by the board'. Webber, an actor who I like, is inadequate for the Jack Torrance role - he simply hasn't got the depth.
A sugary confection best-avoided and by no means a definitive version of the excellent book.
That said the dead woman in the bath is one of the most frightening things I've ever seen rendered on screen, and knocks even Kubrick's creepy version of the scene into a cocked hat. Neither is faithful to the book.",1041897600,4,644,4.758928571428571

This version follows the book, unlike the Stanley Kubrick version, which was a MAJOR disappointment to me ""back in the day"". (I don't think I'll EVER get over Halloran's murder in his version).
Anyway, if you read the book, this is the DVD to watch. Everyone in it is fabulous, the Overlook looks like it should, and the plot is what you're expecting (or scarily anticipating!). I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1041897600,2,584,4.625

Once I started to watch it I was overcome with how superior Stanley Kubrick's take on this story was in the cinema.  This version had so much explanation of everything scary that happens that it lost its ability to scare anyone.  Kubrick's version is haunting and primal in the way that it taps into our fears.  The novel is great but when making a movie...please lay the book aside and start with scene one in cinema terms as Hitchcock used to say.",1041811200,8,553,4.612244897959184

I have seen all the major Stephen King novels turned movies.  Having seen the original Stanley Kubrick version of ""The Shining"" with Jack Nicholson it's hard to top Jack Nickolson's performance.  it is what it is.  When this TV mini-series version was made it was noted Stephen King was involved (and has a cameo role) and it followed closely to the novel.  I was a little suspect of how good it might be due to the cast.  Although widely known for other roles, they just didn't seem like they might be a good fit.  I haven't read the novel so not familiar with difference in the Kubrick version and the novel so the TV mini-series offered some surprising differences between the Kubrick version.  The performances were good and as mentioned tough to top Jack Nicholson but this version from how the story is told is much better.  This version is the version watched more frequently of the two now.  Originally only had the recording from the original televised version so it was great to hear this was coming to DVD.  Snatched it up right away.
