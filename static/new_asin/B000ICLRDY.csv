8144811,3,B000ICLRDY,This is good for primary school but does not delve into the civilizations. It's an overview which can peek your interest. I was disappointed & expected more.,1405468800,3,157,4.851851851851852

8144815,4,B000ICLRDY,"This DVD explores the transitional period between mankind as hunter-gatherer and as settled farmer-husbandman. This video is not about any particular civilization, but rather the first places where man gave up nomadic hunting and stayed in one place to till the soil, building progressively larger communities.

The DVD begins with a look at places like Jericho and another site in Anatolia where there is some of the earliest evidence of this transformation in man's lifestyle. It covers places such as Old Sumer, the Indus Valley, Egypt, China and the New World civilizations of the Olmec and Maya. Civilization arose independently in many places on the globe - which is a good point for the viewer to remember.

The DVD was fairly well made. The viewer gets an idea of how basic and small the first ""cities"" were. The interviews with experts were informative without seeming like a lecture. The cinematography was often quite good. This could even be used in a Jr. High or High School setting.

The only criticisms I have are that the narrator didn't seem to know his stuff and mispronounced several key terms (he pronounces Maya as MAY-ah instead of MY-Yuh) and also that the DVD is a little pricey for a 50-minute video.

On the whole, I recommend this DVD with four-stars.",1331856000,12,1278,4.875576036866359
