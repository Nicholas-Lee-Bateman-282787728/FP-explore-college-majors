8590036,3,B00D6I7EZW,It was okay and not too much exciting movie at all.  Except that it do show some nudity.  Really can't recommend it as much.,1438473600,,124,4.125
8590037,5,B00D6I7EZW,"Sean Weathers is one of the sickest, most twisted, awesome film makers to come along in a long time. This collection of lost works, plus the added in bonus of Night of the Living Dead (which I thought was hilarious that they added that) makes this a great addition to my collection. I became a Sean Weathers fan after seeing ""They All Must Die"" and he has not disappointed me yet. This is classic exploitation at its best. If sleaze is your thing then get this one. Rape, murder, and hell even zombies...priceless.",1411689600,,514,4.537634408602151
8590038,4,B00D6I7EZW,"I always like a bargain and multi film DVDs are always high on my list for that reason. 4 movies; 2 old,  2 new, no complaints.",1391472000,2,127,3.8846153846153846
8590039,5,B00D6I7EZW,"This, like most multi film sets comes with a few movies you've likely already seen or at least you're familiar with. I've seen Night of the Living Dead, but didn't own it and I've heard about Driller Killer but never saw it. Both were awesome and the audio commentary definitely added to my enjoyment them. There are also 2 other films that I couldn't find anywhere else so I think those were the ones that you were supposed to be buying this set for with the other 2 films as bonus material? Not sure. A Good Samaritan was really good but too short. As for, Maniac Too, I don't know if it was intended to be a sequel to the original 1980 version or not, but I feel that was the best part of the DVD. It wasn't as good as Night or Driller mind you, but those are films you can get in other collections. I felt Maniac on its own was good enough for the price I paid and the other 3 films were icing on the cake. That is the main reason for my 5 star review.",1391385600,4,956,4.036842105263158
8590040,3,B00D6I7EZW,"I gave this only three stars because most of this collection is two very well known tag for free on anything , horror films that are in about 15 horror collections i have, the remaining 2 films were mr Weathers and Jones, now those i did like, i would of like to have seen more new stuff maybe they should of waited and just put out a collection of 5 of there own films; but it did give me a chace to hear bits of there internet radio show as intros so that was a bit of a treat so for me it was an added plus, so basically i had no complaints with the original work its just i have seen the other two films a million times which is why i only gave a 3 star rating.",1389830400,2,665,3.79136690647482
