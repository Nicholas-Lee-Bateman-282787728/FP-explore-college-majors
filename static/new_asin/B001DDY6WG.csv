8292954,5,B001DDY6WG,"I was looking for something harder.  I found it.  I love this DVD even though I can't do all of it yet...yet.  But that's the beauty of it.  I will be doing this challenge until I can.  I had to adjust the setting on my TV for sound, but this DVD is awesome.  I am amazed at the weight this guy swings.  It's humbling when I look at my little 10 lb bell and think I'm doing something!!!  This is a true circuit, gym type style workout. One set complete.  And each set gets tougher and tougher.  Great stuff.",1275523200,2,507,4.03030303030303
8292955,5,B001DDY6WG,"This was my first kettlebell DVD and first real kettlebell work out. It was a little awkward and extremely exhausting at first but after a few consistent weeks I was keeping up pretty well. I have since purchased other Kettlebell DVD's (Steve Cotter) which are also excellent but this one from Phil Ross is the most complete, well rounded KB workout I've seen yet. The Cotter videos are more diverse and better explained, but with Ross I use just a fraction of the weight I use during the Cotter workouts and it takes absolutely everything out of me. I saw better physical results with two months of this video than with a year of free weights. Anybody who gives up just didn't give it enough of a chance. No pain, no gain.....",1252368000,5,727,4.515151515151516
8292956,2,B001DDY6WG,"This is a follow along kettlebell workout that consists of warm up taking some 17 minutes, actual workout that is about 19 minutes long, and a burnout section that takes less than three minutes. There is also a separate tutorial section, but the exercises are instructed only briefly.

In my opinion, the warm up takes way too much time considering the length of the workout; it's  almost the same length as the actual workout. Talk about time-efficiency that is usually associated with kettlebell training! Also, you need variety of equipment to go through the warmup, as you need at least a jump rope, a broomstick of some other long stick, and a kettlebell. Again, one is accustomed that with kettlebell training, you need a minimum amount of equipment. Even if a jump rope and a broomstick is not asking for much considering equipment, I'm used to getting a good warm up using kettlebells alone.

The actual workout consists of four combinations of exercises, each combination consisting of three exercises performed back to back with no rest in between. Actually, the transition to one exercise to the next is so quick that you really have to pay attention to keep up the pace. Each combination of exercises is gone through three times, with 30 seconds rest between the sets. There is no time counter, and the break actually lasts less than ten seconds, so you'll have to pause the DVD player (and do that very quickly, at that). It would have improved the user friendliness of the film if you just could keep the DVD running without need to pause the film.

Many of the exercises used in the workout are not your basic kettlebell exercises, and there are some interesting moves presented. However, the exercise selection and the rep ranges used force you to use several kettlebells of different weights, including double 'bells of the same weight - the instructor uses three different sized kettlebells (you'll need two for some exercises), and fourth in the warm up. So if you have only one kettlebell, this workout is not for you. Also, you'll need plenty of room as in one exercise you'll use a towel running through the kettlebell handle and swing the 'bell around your head holding the kettlebell from both ends of the towel.

As the previous reviewer wrote, the instructor does not count the reps during the workout (he does not even tell the target number of reps in each exercise), and he does not tell when to change to the next exercise. So, you'll have to pay close attention to the film during your own workout. This is not a very good thing, as the workout is challenging and the need to divide your attention between your own workout and the DVD makes it even more challenging. So, even if this is meant to be a follow along workout, you hardly can use it such. It's better to make notes of the exercises and reps used, and work out on your own pace. You'll just have to keep watch of the time during the rest periods - but hey, you'll have to do that even if you work out along the DVD.

The workout itself is quite good (provided you have the necessary kettlebells and enough room) but the production of the film leaves much to be desired. The reason I'm giving this film two stars instead of one is that you can use the workout on your own pace rather that training along the DVD. Also, the film is very reasonably priced.",1233273600,10,3345,4.604026845637584
8292957,1,B001DDY6WG,"This is my 3rd KettleBell DVD and if this one and the previous DVD's are all that are out there, I'm going to sell my new KettleBell and strike this off my ""Try and new workout"" resolution.
It is very apparent that the instructor is very well versed in KettleBells. He explains all the moves in the tutorial and has a very nice physique.
The big problem I have with this DVD is that it is not a viwer friendly DVD at all.  During the entire workout portion, you must ""watch"" the instructor do the exercises.  The only words that come out of his mouth are 'Set One Completed"" after the end of an entire set, and so on.  The rest of the exercise time he is inhaling strongly and exhaling strongly, so if your eyes are not glued to the TV set, you won't even know when he switches hands, lifts his leg, or bends down and stands again. This is very difficult (and probably dangerous) when he does push-ups and you have to bend your neck backwards to see what he's doing.  While he is in push-up position, he does one armed push-ups, lifts one leg at a time, and does two armed push-ups. He does not even count down so at least the viewer would know to look up at the end of the count to see a change.  I know it says advanced, but even an advanced person needs some type of count and what exercise is coming next. I'm perplexed at how this DVD made it out of a production house...poorly planned and executed.
I very, very rarely give a 1 star to an exercise DVD, but this one was totally useless. I'm going to swap it out for something more beneficial. A waste of money.",1232496000,23,1566,4.189368770764119
