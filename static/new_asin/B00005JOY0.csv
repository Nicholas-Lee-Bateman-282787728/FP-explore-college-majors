1567206,5,B00005JOY0,"Yes this show is probably best remembered as the birth place of The Simpsons, but Tracey is such a comic talent and the thing I remember best about the show was her ability to take a popular song such as the Rolling Stones ""Paint it Black"" and do a skit about it where she had her kitchen remodeled and in the end, everything was painted black.

I'll be one of the first in line to pick this DVD up if and when it is released.  I can see Tracey now in her closing monologe wearing that big pink robe and telling people to ""Go home, just go home.""",1188259200,18,546,4.046296296296297
1567207,5,B00005JOY0,"please...there's never been anything like this show. i've been waiting for years. release this on dvd! more people need to understand that julie kavner and dan castellaneta are so much more than simpsons (i don't even watch that show, though, yes, it was born of TTUS). this cast of players exhibited such chemistry and fluidity together. these were tracey's best characters. every facet of entertainment was at its peak: dance, song, comedy, dramatic pathos. the world needs to either learn or remember. this was a kooky, kinetic classic.",1174521600,28,539,5.136363636363637

7941773,5,B00005JOY0,"Any network that produces the schlock that is Fox News would naturally eliminate the genius that is the Tracy Ullman Show (which spawned the likes of Dan Castellana, the Simpsons, and included writer Heidi Perlman, etc.).I'd love to add this to my comedy collection. No  one comes close to her brand of complex humor. How can those of us find out if these shows ever become available?  Just keep trying to order them??",1366502400,,418,4.712328767123288
7941774,5,B00005JOY0,"So many incredibly awesome skits from this program...I am so bummed that the three video cassettes I had made back in the 90's were lost by a friend I lent them to.  Ullman and her troupe were brilliant...how I would love to see Kavner as the wheelchair-bound ballet instructor again, Isabella Rosselini and Tracey Ullman verbally sparring over the proctologist (Castallaneta) who is no longer married to Ullman and is dating Rosselini, Ullman as the male psychiatrist explaining to an interviewer how he cured the Dogman of Salzburg, ""Buzz"" (Mel Brooks) auditioning ""Miranda"" (Ullman) for the next film he hopes to direct...I have not seen these skits for over 20 years, but they and many others are so memorable.  Fox has made so much money off ""The Simpsons""...would be nice if they would take a sliver of that and produce the entire series' episodes on DVD.  So many would be so grateful!!!!!",1354320000,6,896,4.881578947368421
7941775,5,B00005JOY0,Loved this show. Would like to add to my DVD collection. Anyone know how we can get FOX to release it on DVD? Maybe a viewer petition?,1333238400,4,134,4.0
7941776,5,B00005JOY0,"Not too much to say, other than here's one more vote for putting this terrific show out on DVD. Please?",1331510400,,103,4.2
7941777,5,B00005JOY0,I have been wishing to see this great show come out on DVD for years! So much dreck is released and a truly original and influencial show as this is not. It's a shame.,1289088000,9,167,3.9411764705882355
7941778,5,B00005JOY0,"I remember when FOX first started broadcasting and this was one of it's anchor shows on Sunday nights.  I always hated Sunday night knowing I had to go back to work on Monday morning, but having this show on somehow made it a little bit better.  For me, this was my generations Carol Burnett.  Tracey could do it all - sing, dance and be funny.  And it wasn't humor that was dumb downed, it was intelligent and clever humor. It is sad that the biggest thing this series is remembered for is 'The Simpsons' because there was so much more to it.  The cast, the writing and the use of music were all woven together into one terrific show.",1286928000,8,635,4.302521008403361
7941779,5,B00005JOY0,"I remember how much I loved the ingenious skits in this series. It was a wonderful mix of comedy, music, and dance. If I had to guess why this show is not being released on DVD I would say it has everything to do with "" The Simpsons "" lawsuit , and the fact that Tracey came out with another show recentley. So the question is : Does Fox want us to just forget how much better her first series was and be resigned to never being able to enjoy those awesome characters again, because of a silly cartoon that got it's start on her show 20 years ago? Please Fox , and or Tracey, get the red tape worked out and give us your best work to enjoy again and again .",1213920000,18,657,3.9473684210526314
7941780,1,B00005JOY0,"No matter how hard I tried to like this show, it hardly made me smile.  Unfortunately you had to drone through it just to catch the flash of the Simpsons at the time.

Sketches were the same droll characters over and over, and included WAAAY too much choreographed, off-key singing (Dan Castellanetta and Julie Kavner singing... good!?!  Good God!!!)  Understand that they have talent, just not in the singing area.  Choreography belongs on Broadway instead of clogging up my valuable TV time.  Remember Cop Rock? There's a reason why that flopped...",1204761600,,550,4.989010989010989
7941781,5,B00005JOY0,"I don't recall The Tracey Ullman show ever being on DVD, but should be.  If it will never happen then I regret losing the tapes I had.  I remember sitting in front of the tv cracking up...you just never knew what Tracey was gonna do.  And I love how the Simpsons cartoons would come on halfway through the show.  Julie Kavner was clearly much more than Rhoda Morgenstern's little sister in the 70s (oops showing my age) and more than the voice behind Marge Simpson.  Of course there seems to be no limit on Tracey's talents  C'mon...let's get this on DVD already!!!!",1198972800,8,566,4.5
