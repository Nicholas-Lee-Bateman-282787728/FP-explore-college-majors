8272763,5,B001990LOG,"What's holding up the release of the television series 'The Others'?  Is there something the fans don't know?  Some creative accounting that requires no more money be made on it?  Or spent on making it available to the public?  Maybe the name got sold and the series cannot be marketed under its own title?  I`m feeling paranoid, but I`m hunting for a reason other than sloth behind keeping this show off the market.  Because I don`t understand for a second why this series wasn`t renewed, and I think it`s the best thing of its kind ever to run on network television.  The cast was interesting, each member of it engaging to watch, both for acting ability and for the intelligence in his or her face.  The premise was intriguing, and many of the characters had different abilities from the normal telepathy and mediumship usually found in more run-of-the-mill psychic-oriented stories.

The episodes portrayed people whose gifts might curse them, and who  had to bear with their trials and tribulations, needing the compassion and understanding of their friends, sometimes finding that seeking that compassion was the worst thing they could do.  Yes, they fought evil in various guises, but they also fought fear, passion, anger, jealousy -- oh, all the personal demons real people fight, whether they`ve got paranormal powers or not.

I only wish someone would pick up the rights to the series and recreate it now, perhaps having to recast the show, but keeping the characters and their individualities intact.  And hire back the writers.  Someone or someones with great cleverness and feeling for the `others` in this world, the ones who are different and don`t quite fit in, created and wrote 13 episodes which I still remember and want to see again long years later.  I`m prepared to pay for my pleasure in viewing it anew.

If there`s doubt that anyone values the series enough to put money out to buy it, just look at the reviews here.  Five stars, every one, as I write this -- the show garnered fans who have remained fans long after it collapsed and are clamouring for it.  Bring it out now and we`ll spread the word.  Think of it as a cult classic, or just classic, and classy, as it was and is.  It deserves better than to be locked up in a dusty vault somewhere. Put the show on two DVDs, please, and let us enjoy it again.",1333065600,8,2336,4.678921568627451

Just put it out already.",1323993600,,114,4.428571428571429
8272765,5,B001990LOG,"From what I remembered it was great, better than Ghost Whisperers, but reminiscent of Flatliners. It was unfortunate it lasted such as short time. I also heard that the episodes were not played in order either. Not sure why this isn't out, unless there are copyright issues. It would be nice to see them all or even look into redoing it for TV.",1309824000,3,344,4.476190476190476
8272766,5,B001990LOG,"Like everyone else here, I don't know why this show hasn't been released sooner.  Great storylines, enjoyed the actors/acting, this was a quality show, I was amazed it only had one season and very disappointed when it ended.  Glad to see there's a possibility it will be out soon--I only wish there had been many more seasons to watch!",1302998400,,335,4.661016949152542
8272767,5,B001990LOG,I have to agree with everyone else.  Where is the dvd and why did the show go off the air?  It is a great show that never got a chance.,1298678400,,135,3.466666666666667
8272768,5,B001990LOG,"I AM FROM  SYDNEY AUSTRALIA & LIKE MOST BUSY PEOPLE I COME HOME & WATCH TV TO RELAX.
BUT I AM SICK OF THE INFERIOR SO CALLED SCI FI TV SERIES THAT THE PRODUCERS ARE PUTTING OUT.  THIS SERIES WAS EXCELLENT & MY 2 CHILDREN, 17 & 22 AT THE TIME THE SHOW CAME OUT ON FOX IN AUSTRALIA,  THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.  VERY ORIGINAL & SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED.  MUCH BETTER THAN SANCTURY,  WHAREHOUSE 13 & THE OTHER SERIES THAT SEEM TO BE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME LIKE VAMPIRE DIARIES.
THE CHARACTERS WERE GOOD & THE 1ST SERIES WAS BUILDING UP TO BE VERY INTERESTING.  THEN THE SHOW WAS AXED.  WHAT A BUMMER.
THIS SHOULD BE ON D V D AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO I CAN KEEP IT.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1286755200,4,680,4.022388059701493
8272769,5,B001990LOG,"I love this show, caught a marathon on Chiller a few years ago and was hooked. This show was originally aired at least 10 years ago, why the delay in releasing a DVD set? Especially when other shows of lesser quality were released almost right away.

 It would have been nice to get a conclusion to the cliffhanger the show ended on but after so much time it's a lost cause.",1273536000,3,374,4.253521126760563
8272770,4,B001990LOG,"This is a great show. It had a late time-slot here in Australia but i stayed up to watch it. (cos i was still at school at the time) Its about a group of psychics with different abilities who help people fight evil. Ghosts, demons or whatever...........when is it released...?",1234742400,8,276,4.54
