There was so much (horrific) publicity surround the Dark knight, however, I enjoy this Batman and will surely be swiftly swepted away with the story and acting.",1367280000,,235,4.9

3616300,5,B001GMALGY,"Well I no that batman has always been an outstanding franchise from comics to video games.  Every movie (not including Batman Forever) deserves at least a four star rating.  This well...this is so much more.  I love both movies.  Batman Begins was one of those movies where you can watch it over and over.  The Dark Knight will last forever and go down as one of the best if not the best batman movie of all time.  In fact this whole batman series; depending on how good The Dark Knight Rises will be; will be forever remembered like Jaws, Star Wars, and Indiana Jones.  The only other series I know that can do that that is still making great movies is Harry Potter.  I think this set is good for the hard core batman fan or the casual person who wants to watch a movie on Saturday night this weekend.  The set itself is also very nice.  As always being in Blu-ray is a BIG plus.  Get this!  I know the movies alone are only $7.99 a piece but I still recommend this to everyone everywhere.

WATCH THE FIRST ONE FIRST!!! DON'T BE TEMPTED TO WATCH THE BETTER ONE!!!!",1325203200,,1065,4.291457286432161
3616301,5,B001GMALGY,"I will spare the reader reviews of the films because those are fantastic and not the issue!  What I will review is the packaging.  I was not aware that the product I order was packaged in Europe.  Upon opening the Blu-ray combo pack of Dark Knight and Batman Begins, which arrived quickly, I noticed that the Blu-ray labels where written in foreign language and the box covers had symbols not related to any US rating systems.  The text on the back was English yet the inserts in the Blu-ray were not.  Aside from this, the Blu-rays themselves were all in English which was a big relief.  Again the product/combo pack is great just be aware that the packaging is from Europe but the Blu-rays are 100% in English.

Side bar...I am really hoping for a great end with The Dark Knight Rises.  Don't know who will replace Bale/Nolan.  Those are some pretty big shoes to fill because surely the Batman movie franchise won't end.",1323388800,5,922,4.573170731707317
