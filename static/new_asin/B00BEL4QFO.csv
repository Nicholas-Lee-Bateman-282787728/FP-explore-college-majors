5608156,4,B00BEL4QFO,"This movie was not what I expected. Based off the previews I had my pre
conceived notions about how the film was going to be. I was pleasantly
surprised with all of the different messages throughout the film. I
enjoyed the fact that it had its comedic moments as well as ones where
I did not want to blink just in case I missed something. This film will
suck you in as if you are the main character and leave you with a
feeling of are you making the right choices in your own relationship.",1364515200,97,489,4.157894736842105

5608283,5,B00BEL4QFO,This was an eye opening when we marry too young and has not experienced life from a teenager or younger adult view. We think love from a school friend is all we need. Not so many times. Was a wake up call that participate in something with no knowledge. Listening to smooth talk and setting ourselves as though we know what we are doing. I give it a 10!!!,1482364800,,355,4.159420289855072

5608322,5,B00BEL4QFO,This movie is awesome. It is the kind of movie that should make anyone think twice before you think about having a affair out side of your marriage.

5608344,1,B00BEL4QFO,"this is one of the worst films Perry has ever  made.  the messages in the film are horrible.  i was truly disappointed with the messages about HIV/AIDS, religion, family, victim blaming, the lack of responsibility on the part of the person responsible for spreading the disease, and the husband asking his wife the put off her dreams so that he could achieve his.  the message is that if the wife stayed in her submissive, supportive role none of this would have happened.  in the end the wife is left alone, shattered, and a shell of a woman.  many people with HIV live vibrant lives and are not relegated to the dark corners of our world.",1459987200,2,640,4.521739130434782

5608569,5,B00BEL4QFO,"This movie is SOOOOOO good! There is a lesson showing us that we better obey God and follow the 7th Commandment and that is to ""Not commit Adultery."" Jehovah God knows what hes talking about when he says this because Adultery will DESTROY your life and it will send you straight to Hell! Jurnee Smollett-Bell played an excellent role showing us how Satan will fool your mind into believing that the grass is greener on the other side and it goes to show you to NEVER take your family for granted because you will be sorry in the end. This movie should be shown to all married couples and people who are about to get married because it is so easy to fall into the trap of deception of betraying your spouse which is your family and only hurting yourself in the end. When you commit Adultery you only DESTROY yourself because its only just an illusion. Just when you think you are getting away with someone trust me your not because you will eventually reap what you have sown....Adultery NEVER works out stay away from it!",1426032000,5,1021,4.46524064171123

5608628,5,B00BEL4QFO,"Another great and emotional movie Tyler Perry created.

It was about a 20-something woman (Jurnee Smollett) who was happily married at first but became bored with her marriage and job eventually. She met this rich, charismatic man who ""fell in love"" and gave her what she wanted. However, there were negative consequences for the actions/decisions she made.

This is a good movie for younger and older viewers alike.",1420329600,5,416,5.102941176470588
5608629,4,B00BEL4QFO,"I loved this movie. It was very interesting and touching cautionary tale that reminds you not to take your loved ones for granted.

5608667,5,B00BEL4QFO,Tyler Perry has done it again by producing another great movie.  This movie sends a message in regards to the bad things that can happen to somebody that commits adultery.  In this case the adulterer not only contracts AIDS during the process but also ends up losing a good husband.

However,not keen on Kim k's role and the suggestion that if u are not dolled up with the finest and most expensive clothes and attire everyday that a man will lose that complete interest. That i suppose is the world or lifestyle of a Kardashian. Regular folks cant afford things in Paris and official designer wear from countries around the world. This part in the movie was a bit very unrealistic. But that does not mean a woman should not keep herself looking her best for her man, so if that was the message in her role in the movie Point taken! it was a story that needed to be told..Sometimes the grass may look greener on the other side, and if it looks well kept that does not mean there are not some deep rooted issues insects and a few snakes in it.",1410480000,5,844,4.248447204968944

Eve was happy in the Garden of Eden with her husband and serving the Heavenly Father until one day, Satan (disguised as a serpent) suggested that something was missing in her life and caused her to make a tragic decision.  Similarly, Judith and Brice are happy until Harley plants seeds of doubt in Judith's head and causes her to question what is missing in her life.  It really opened my eyes and made me think about anything that could seduce us and lead us down a destructive path; we have to ask ourselves if it's worth it in the long run and would it be worth risking and losing everything we have.",1402617600,11,965,4.801204819277109

5608743,1,B00BEL4QFO,"This movie was just bad. The casting was terrible. When I see a movie, I like to escape from reality and get absorbed in the plot and acting. Unfortunately, the casting of a Reality TV star prevented me from doing that. I kept thinking, with all of the wonderfully talented professional actors and people who studied acting, why would they cast a Reality TV star without any acting talent in this move? It just diminished the movie and I could not watch any further.",1400976000,3,466,4.559523809523809

5608745,4,B00BEL4QFO,"This was my first viewing of a Tyler Perry production so I was expecting a romantic comedy.  Wow, was I surprised.  This film is true to the Black culture yet it also relates to eternal and universal qualities of the human psyche when it comes to dating, relationships, marriage and aging.  The characters could have lapsed into stereotypes, yet here, each also portrayed a deeper level of realism beyond the mask.  The husband was kind of boring and his game fell down, yet he was trying cuz the dude was tired from working hard day in, day out, after all.  His acting seemed kind of thin at times yet there really are guys like him.  The mother seemed like she was Bible thumping, yet the woman had lived a lot of life and could see what was going on with her keen eagle eye.  The wife didn't do anything wrong, she just needed attention and she was frustrated cuz she was busting her rear yet she wasn't realizing her dream fast enough.  Her transformation was intriguing to watch and yet it portrayed yearnings we harbor within, quite a range, and well done in her role.  One wonders what drives the billionaire player within his thought process, which is more implied than stated, the better to ponder, after the movie has ended.  The film raises some good questions about the existential quandary folks can find themselves in, doing the accepted things yet feeling so utterly unhappy and unfulfilled in their lives, hinting at the huge octopus of the system, as they go through their lives.  The director/creator has woven a cautionary tale that doesn't cop out in the end, not to sermonize or to endorse stereotypes, yet to show that as a community, there are some real dangers out there for which we are frail and naive to deal with if we stay in our comfort zones.",1399075200,,1773,4.579113924050633

5608762,4,B00BEL4QFO,"I'm a Tyler Perry and I like it when he steps away from what people consider the regular Tyler Perry movies/plays. This movie was good but it felt incomplete somehow. I felt the story could've been developed a little more and Harley's life after all of this should've been shown. Also, I think the jump from the current story to years later could've been expounded on some. Other than that, it was a pretty decent movie. I will watch it again. It does tell a great story about what can happen if you stray too far from your covering in God and stop communicating in your relationship(s).",1396742400,,587,4.4953271028037385

5608765,3,B00BEL4QFO,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this film! I actually went in thinking it would be one kind of movie, but it turned out to have a little more substance than I would have thought.

To be clear - the movie had a few flaws - it seemed to go over the top in helping the audience to understand where the characters were coming from, and also a couple of the key characters  seemed to be fairly one dimensional in my opinion.

Despite that, I found that I really did enjoy this movie very much. The lead actress did a fantastic job conveying the pull of a world that she knew was not right for her against the safe world of her youth and her husband. I thought that the story told overall was a good morality tale, although the tie in of two characters at the end seemed a little too convenient for me. It was intended to be a surprise, but you were almost expecting it.

Overall, I would watch this again and recommend it to others to enjoy. I liked that fact that the movie didn't compromise and provided an ending that reflects the cost that sometimes must be paid to be ""in the game"". And did so in a way that felt true, but not overly done. I'd pick this one up!",1396310400,3,1164,4.1371681415929205

Is 'too real' a bad thing? I thought the main characters did a fine job since I only knew two of them, but I felt that it could use a boost in the action. I think Brandy sings ten times better than she acts, but otherwise... It was predictable and I needed the rising action to be a little more intense.

5608784,5,B00BEL4QFO,"This is a cautionary tale. It was done so beautifully, that's it's heartbreaking. The kind of heartbreak you feel hours after the television has been shut off.

 I know many movie critics out there did dislike this movie because of the ending. But the ending is what makes this movie the heavy hitter that it is. It teaches you something, and it had to shock you to do that. Sadly, these situations do happen, and they do start with an innocent weakness we let get out of hand.

My heart went out to Judith and the devastating aftermath the implosion created. She was so innocent that she didn't see how a situation could get out of control so badly. She even had the warning signs right in front of her. It was just tragic.

While it was one of the darker Tyler Perry films, it was still a stunner. I loved it.",1394236800,,811,4.315789473684211

And the end sticks in my mind because it's not happy, it was sad and a shame. Cheating on my mate was and is never an option. You reap what you sow. Too bad people don't get it in life and in marriage. And kudos to Kim Kardashian.

They need to follow what the message of the film is and the main message is ""the grass in not greener on the other side"". I found this to be his best drama since ""Colored Girls"" which was more darker and intense but so was this. Thumbs up to Tyler Perry and God bless him!",1388361600,,608,4.075

The story was good and the cast for the characters of the film were on point in their dramatic performance. Once the passion for the illicit circumstance sets in, the pace increases intensity and the story becomes more engaging. It is worth the watch.",1388275200,,349,4.555555555555555

5608851,3,B00BEL4QFO,"The movie was great. It followed the concept of falling into temptation and its circumstances. I was disappointed because the film should have had more dramatics and a story line to follow. The movie was too rushed. Everything happened too fast instead of going at a normal speed. All of Tyler Perry's fans would applaud him for doing a great job because they are in love with Tyler Perry for his personality and what he stands for. They are not critically watching his films! As far as the film, it should have not included Kim Kardashian because she was very irrelevant to the story line. If he wanted to have her character remain in the film then she should have had stronger development. The boss, Vanessa Williams' character, should have been more of a mentor to Judith's character by advising her on how not to fall into temptation. There wasn't anyone in the film who could have warned Judith of not falling into Harley's trap. Vanessa Williams' character should have been the one who went through a situation of temptation and shared her wisdom with Judith instead of being some superficial character. Judith's husband should have had a man to man interaction with Harley to intensify the love triangle even more. Judith's husband should have further investigated his wife's infidelity and tried to understand why things were going sour. Judith's character should have been a little bit more stronger if she noticed the earrings and shoes in Harley's apartment then why would she still fall for him? Harley did things that Judith's husband forgot or was to busy to do, but I thought that Judith would have had more sense than that. The play was much better than the film. I feel like Tyler Perry takes his great concepts and try to ""Hollywood-ize"" his roles to give black actors/actresses a chance to work. Nothing is wrong with that, but he needs to do further character development rather than trying to become friends with his actors/actresses. I don't understand why he doesn't allow the actors in his plays to do the films as well. It's like he's only looking at Hollywood to make them more famous. Actors/Actresses who does plays are well crafted in their work. One last thing about the film, Harley's character came on too fast. It was already clear that he was a tempter, but if you are  crafty as the devil then you would have played a little bit more with your victim's mind. Tyler Perry is a great filmmaker, but he needs to craft his work a little bit better.",1385164800,10,2479,4.711981566820277

5608908,3,B00BEL4QFO,"Let me start by saying that this movie wasn't that bad but it was one of the worse films writing by Mr. Perry. Lately, his films and plays been a little off.

This fil wasn't to realistic for me. I don't know if it was the characters, the settings, the wardrobe or what but something wasn't right about this movie. The previews made this movie look good. The only characters who actually came to my liking was Brandy's and the guy who played the husband. However, Brandy was running from a guy who wasn't even paying her any attention. And it was blankly obvious who she was running from in the first place. Secondly, the husband didn't seem much like a realistic workaholic because no body works that hard to the point where they literally forget their Lover's birthday. They been together for how many years? If that's the case, wouldn't he possibly forget his own? Another issue was the 'villian'. When Tyler creates his enemies, they are usually what? Good looking right? You know the kind that would have you gazing in dessert store looking at some fresh Red Velvet when you just bought Carrot? He usually have models playing this roles not some skinny, small headed gremlin, who came on completely strong by complementing every 5 seconds. I mean come on, who is that gullable to where a guy complemments you 5 times in one sentence and its all you?

All the other actors, I didn't really care for. Including Kim Kardasian. Damn, I would have never thought she couldn't act as much personality she has on her show's previews. It was so obvious that she was wearing her clothing line, yet couldn't support it. Kick that career to the curb!

The fight scenes were short and overly dramatic. The fight between the gremlin and the cheating wife was pathedic. Not that I condone violence between man and women, but if your goal is to prove your message: Everything isn't green on the other Side,"" than I want you to put it on screen realistically. The fight between both the men were hyped up over nothing! I mean you just found out that this Gremlin has your wife and gave her HIV, and all you could do was toss him around?

I can understand, why he had this guy clearly go around having every unprotected sex with anyone, because people do tend to do such things but of all things, HIV? Really? I would expected a happy ending.

I don't know if Tyler had to Clip some things out, but the film seems about rushed and unfinished and unhappy. You don't even know what happened to the guy who caused all of this. He's losing his game and he should find it quick.",1378598400,3,2560,4.496774193548387

Most of Tyler Perry's films earn this rating from me except for Alex Cross (this film have one too many violent scenes for me.  A little out of the box for Tyler.)
I recommended this film to a couple who is happily married except for the last 7 years when her husband seek a temptation outside of the marriage.  He claimed that he doesn't know how to get out.  Does he want to get out?  Having both world is heaven to him, now.  I don't beleive that he realized what he have in his marriage.

5608986,1,B00BEL4QFO,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

With an extremely low score of '27' on Metacritic, Tyler Perry's Temptation was universally panned by the critics. On Metacritic, Perry managed only 1 positive review, 2 mixed and 11 negatives. Still, the first week the picture came out, it managed a #3 ranking at the box office. Based on his own stage play, Perry has been quoted as saying that the film version is the best thing he's ever written. In reality, Temptation is no different than most of the soap operas out there today. It's a cheap little story, with thin characters and an over-moralizing plot.

The protagonist is Judith, a marriage counselor, who provides a cautionary tale of infidelity to a client, pretending that the subject is her sister, but is actually her own life story. During the overlong narration at the beginning of the film, Judith's story is explained in a flashback that serves as most of the film's narrative. Judith married her childhood sweetheart, Brice, who works in a pharmacy. They supposedly have a picture book relationship but it appears Judith is a bit of a social climber, desiring to start her own match making business.

Meanwhile, Judith's actual job is working for Janice (Vanessa Williams), who runs a high-end match making agency, seeking clients of substantial means. I found it difficult to believe that Judith could have lasted more than a few days there, as she constantly makes it clear that she resents working at the tawdry agency. Kim Kardashian, plays her bitchy co-worker, Ava, who criticizes her for dressing too conservatively and the two exchange barbs until Judith's sudden about face at the midpoint, when she embraces a new world of 'depravity'.

For most of the film, Judith is a rigid, unlikeable character, egged on by her mother 'Miss Sarah', an old-fashioned, fire and brimstone Christian, who predicts her daughter's fall from grace. Perry can do little with Brice, a cookie-cutter 'nice guy', who exhibits few personality traits of interest. All Perry seems to know about Brice's involvement in the pharmacy business is that he must constantly toil, taking care of the 'inventory' which makes him tired, and less attentive to Judith when gets home. Note that it's really irrelevant what kind of work Brice does, as it could be any type of business. Perry is not concerned with fleshing out his characters by focusing on the idiosyncratic details of their lives--only the tawdry plot which will be discussed in a moment.

The main plot of Temptation involves Harley, a social media magnate, who is one of Janice's clients at her match making agency, and who she hopes will invest in her company. Harley hardly seems like a Bill Gates type but more like a slick player from the sports world (note again, the characters' professions are irrelevant and interchangeable). He ends up falling for Judith and two thirds of the movie seems more like a story ripped from a Harlequin Romance, with Harley courting Judith at such venues as his private jet, breaking her down and eventually seducing her.

From true romance, Perry shifts gears in the third act, attempting to turn his soap opera into a sordid thriller, a la Brian de Palma. Suddenly Harley has morphed into a drug-addicted monster and sucks Judith into the sleazy club world (not very good for his image as social media magnate but more believable as a superstar pro football player). Harley the monster throws Judith's mother to the ground while she's conducting a prayer service with her friends and then ends up beating Judith up, who Brice saves after his co-worker at the pharmacy reveals that Harley did the same thing to her and gave her HIV.

The worst part of Temptation is of course Mr. Perry's proclivity toward old-fashioned moralizing. An affair in Mr. Perry's mind can only result in the worst type of consequences. The woman ends up with the 'devil' himself (the repulsive Harley) and is then scarred for the rest of her life. As Judith hobbles down the street at film's end, the scene reminds me of the nightmare sequence from 'It's a Wonderful Life', where Mary Bailey ends up a spinster, working at the public library. Here too, Judith will remain a spinster, joining her boring mother, at church services. Perry takes the side of moralizing Christians, promoting the dictum: 'if you cheat, you pay'.

Like most melodramas of this ilk, Tyler Perry doesn't know how to create characters that resemble real people. They are only cheap cardboard cutouts, placed inside a narrative that's been done to death, for years. The fact that this film was financially successful, only goes to show that the tastes of the majority of film goers out there today, are on a very low, aesthetic level.",1376352000,5,4726,4.89875

While there is some profanity, there's very little.  This movie starts off very slow, but it depicts ""true life"" events, and has very interesting twists and turns.  It is a movie of deception where one beautiful young lady thought that the grass was greener on the other side and when all was said and done, this young lady's life was ruined.  She lost her husband, she lost her health to HIV virus, she lost her peace of mind of ever really knowing if she will experience true love again.  Was it all worth it?

Judith was dumb, her husband was crap, Judith's mom was an overbearing zealot,and I love Brandy but her role was kind of pointless, Harley was supposed to be tempting but other than money he really had nothing to offer. I just felt there was no good characters or real character development at all. If KIM K is the best character in the whole movie then you probably have a very bad movie lol. This movie was boring and predictable, before it even came on I already knew that the women speaking would be telling the story about her life, and that Brandy was obviously in hiding from Harley (who was never really shown looking for her anyway...), and of course that the husband wouldn't get hiv because he was the good guy, when in reality he would have since the majority of new hiv cases are ppl who thought they were in a monogamous relationship. But, I digress. Really I just think that TP can do better he just doesn't because he'll always have the older, black, good church folk audience for these unoriginal, and uninspiring, over the top morality tales.",1374105600,7,1388,4.511904761904762
5609053,5,B00BEL4QFO,"From all the trailers of this movie I expected to see a movie that was from the cheater's point of view, a view point that glorified cheating and explained why it is okay.  This movie was life changing for me.  I expected to see cheating from the side that I normally would judge harshly and thought I am going to come to see cheating as something that is accepted and understand it.  The movie starts out showing the building of a loving relationship, two people who marry young, they are first loves and come from church going moral families. The couple marry's young, get the needed education to pursue the careers they both want, all the while falling into a comfortable and predictable routine in which they start taking each other for granted, being less attentive and stop putting effort into the relationship.  I think it's important that the movie shows this as the lines between right and wrong start to get blurred. The audience is able to see how these patterns may be happening in there own lives and that if you continue on this path you can be prey to others who start up flirtations with you leading you into adultery.  In no way am I saying the one who gets cheated on is at fault, but you can see that they sometimes help play a part in it by how there relationship is with there spouse.
The movie shows adultery from the viewpoints of each person and even the church going mother in law. Adultery effects the couple and those around them, it can set off a chain of reaction that will connect you to others and forever change you.  Adultery does not always lead to fatal or dooms day events, maybe it won't lead to the end of your marriage or cost you the future you envisioned, but it will leave a stain on your soul that you will always know is there and will never be cleaned off no matter how much you repent.  Once you cross the line of right to wrong, you can never undo that choice.
This movie saved my marriage making me think about how divorce or cheating is a BIG deal and how much that alters your life and can't be undone.  If you want out, be sure and really give it your all and own up to your part of how you got where you are in order to turn things around.",1374019200,41,2191,4.288135593220339

5609069,1,B00BEL4QFO,"I usually like Tyler Perry movies, mostly his Madea films. I don't go to the actual theater to watch them but to rent or watch on cable, they're entertaining. Some of his work is kind of corny but I understand he wants to go for moral values. I'm not a religious person myself but I understand having values. However, this movie had to be his worst! I don't know what happened. He's done WAY better than this. I'm actually shocked by all these five star reviews. Maybe I'm not the films core Christian fanbase. This movie was low budget and it showed. Where do I begin? First of all:

This Harley(the other man) was not that attractive. His lines were extremely cheesy and he came on too strong. How did a well-educated 25 year old woman fall for that nonsense? He reminded me of one of those flashy, arrogant womanizers you see at the club every friday and saturday night like its a side job! Is this what happens when a woman is only with one man her whole life? Sure glad I didn't marry young! At least when I get married I won't be easily swooned by some dummy in a nice suit cause I peeped that game by the time I was 21.

I love Vanessa Williams but that french accent was awful. She would've been better off using her regular American dialect and her character would've been fine with me.

Kim Kardashians Oscar worthy performance has been pretty much explained in the other reviews so we'll just let sleeping dogs lye.

Brandy was running from this guy as if he was chasing her. He wasn't even checking for her not once throughout the whole movie and she's entering her apartment with a bat! Girl, please!

Brice(the husband)! Ugh, I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy as if he's this nice sweet husband who was victimized by his whoring wife? What kind of husband forgets his wife's birthday two years in a row? Did he even bother to mark it down on a calender? Did he really tell his wife that she can realize her dream in 10-15 years cause ""ain't nobody thinking about that right now""? The kicker for me was when she came in to the kitchen wanting to have spontaneous sex with him and he turns her down to go eat a sandwich!  He wanted to go in the bedroom and ""do this the right way"". So because they're a nice christian couple, they can't spice up their sex life? It has to be in the bed, missionary style and no way else? How can you be that clueless to your partner's unhappiness? The guy seemed like he was in his own little world and got so comfortable in his simple little marriage with his simple little Christian wife whom he married a virgin that he neglected to keep the spark in his relationship. The guy was boring, had no passion and no backbone!

Judith! Oh Judith! What was up with the awful clothes she had on in the beginning of the movie? You mean to tell me that she was so sheltered growing up that she never learned how to put together a conservative AND stylish outfit? The whole affair was so over the top. Why was she always limping out of the car? Was she on drugs? I didn't see any drug use! Was she drunk? I assume she didn't really drink much before. If she was unhappy she should've just separated from her husband and took some time to herself. The affair seemed exciting only because she was practically locked in the house or the church building growing up. She never dated and from the looks of it, had no friends either. She obviously needed to be alone and find out what SHE wanted.

Her mother had to be the most ridiculous character in this whole movie! What a heavy handed,judgemental and self-righteous woman she was. How are you going to come up in to your daughters house with a prayer group uninvited? That is just rude. That is not your house. This woman thought everyone was the devil! Goodness!

Why oh why did she have to get HIV? Why did Tyler feel that this was necessary? How was this guy carrying around HIV and still having sex with all these women and running a billion dollar business? Why was he dating these simple middle class local girls? A man of that caliber would be sailing the french riviera with a 20 year old supermodel, not stalking Brandy in Washington DC while trying to seduce  some modest homely married woman with no taste in style. Nothing about this film was realistic at all! It was advertised as a sexy drama but it wasn't sexy and you didn't see any love making, nudity or anything. It was all so dry and rushed! The affair went from 0 to 360 in like fifteen minutes. I'm also sick of this idea that the rich, successful person always has to be some immoral, spiritually lost, evil person because they have money, meanwhile the poor character with a dead end job is so sweet, humble and kind. Does Tyler Perry not have millions? Can you not have money, be well dressed and be a good person too?",1373760000,22,4784,4.359147025813693

5609071,1,B00BEL4QFO,"Don't waste your 2 hours and your money on this money.  The story had potential but fizzled in its execution.  The characters seemingly were written by one person.  The characters are very boring characters and the did not vary in personality as people. The strongest actor out of the movie was Vanessa Williams, albeit a very small part she had.  Kim Khardasian acting was like a horror movie - she was scarely awful!  The part was probably a good part for her to play since the character loves style, clothes, makeup, etc.  And you would think the part wouldn't be a stretch for her and she would be able to jump right in and make the part her own.  She failed.  Her caught-in-headlights doe-eyed stares and over botoxed eyebrows were a distraction and made her expressions appear flat and emotionless.

Tyler Perry is attempting to divest from his typical buffoonery movies and I applaud him for his ATTEMPT.  I enjoyed his movie ""Good Deeds"" and I was hoping the I-can-write-serious-stuff talent he showed in that movie, would also be in this movie...I was hoping to win the lottery, too, but that didn't happen either.

It comes down to this, if you are looking for characters with depth and a believable story, fast foward through this mess of a movie.  I felt like I was watching a horrible accident on the side of the road in slow motion and I couldn't make myself turn my head away.  Just like a police officer guarding an horrible car accident scene on the side of a road would say, ""There is nothing to see here, folks.  Keep moving.

5609082,1,B00BEL4QFO,"I am a Tyler Perry fan but even this movie missed the mark for me. It was low-budget and seems more like a made for TV drama than a theatrical release.

As with all of Perry's movies, this one has a great moral or theme that takes real-life situations and brings the most important points home. With the title ""Temptation"" there is no mystery as to what is going to happen in the movie. Girl and boy meet as children in a small, quaint town, fall in love, get married, move to the big city (Washington, DC), girl is educated and in what she thinks is a dead end job, an attractive, rich man starts working at her job and flirts with her, girl decides her husband is boring and falls in ""lust"" with the new man, the new man isn't what he seems, and everyone suffers the consequences. Old story and predictable but it could have been a terrific movie. If only the acting weren't horrible.

First, why in the world would anyone cast Kim Kardashian in a movie where she has to talk? That's just dumb from the start. Then as a double no-no, Perry put Brandi in a secondary role. Brandi can barely sing and she acts worse than she sings! Now, Vanessa Williams and Ella Joyce can actually act - but in other films. In this movie they don't have much screen time, which is a shame because all of the other actors need as much help as they can get. I really felt sorry for the leading man, Lance Gross, because he tried his best and did a halfway decent job. Too bad the movie fell down around him.

Then, Tyler Perry went overboard with the cliches in the script. The husband is a bit of a whimp and doesn't confront men who are gawking at his wife so of course the other man does confront someone who is oggling her. In addition, the husband has a job as a pharmacy clerk while the wife has her masters degree and graduated early from school. So she feels that she is out-growing him. The other man, Robbie Jones, flaunts his wealth in order to snag the leading lady (tries to seduce her on his private jet) but of course has a secret. The wife's mother is ultra religious and of course she comes to stay with her daughter and son-in-law and notices something is wrong and lectures her with lots of gospel laden advice. And on and on and on. It gets a bit tiring after a while.

I wasn't too upset that this movie was so painful to watch because I rented it from RedBox - so it only cost $1.27. That's the upper limit of what this movie is worth - even with the good theme.",1373414400,4,2466,4.218220338983051
5609083,1,B00BEL4QFO,"For a great many people, Tyler Perry is a household name associated with some of the greatest entertainment on the planet.  From stage work to television, and of course on the big screen, Perry has created a brand of entertainment all his own.  He's taken drag to a whole new level, creating the popular character Madea, whom he portrays in a handful of films, including Diary of a Mad Black Woman, Madea's Big Happy Family, and the upcoming film, A Madea Christmas.  However, when he's not portraying Madea (or doing a million other things), he occasionally stars in much more serious roles, like in Good Deeds or Alex Cross.  However, in his newest film - Perry does everything but act, staying behind the camera as writer, producer, and director, for the marriage drama, Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor.

Directed by Tyler Perry (Madea's Family Reunion), Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor stars Jurnee Smollett as Judith, a married woman that's frustrated with her position as a therapist for an online dating agency (strictly for the wealthy).  Her husband, Brice (Lance Gross), has been the love or her life since they were young children.  However, both Judith and Brice are highly devoted to their careers, and have settled in to a comfortable, ""boring"" marriage.  Meanwhile, Judith's job pairs her with an internet mogul as she attempts to sell him on the idea of investing in the company she works for - but at the same time, this internet mogul, Harley (Robbie Jones) is much more interested in stealing Judith from her husband.  As Harley and Judith grow closer, her ""temptation"" to cheat on her husband grows to the breaking point.  Vanessa Williams, Brandy Norwood, and Kim Kardashian also star in supporting roles.

In general, the theme of ""temptation"" has always made for interesting storytelling, so it's not too difficult to imagine what this film is all about:  characters being tempted.  The story focuses on a semi-happily married couple that is feeling the strains of marriage - both far too comfortable with each other, leaving the ability for them to do is grow apart.  The themes within this film are strong and to the point, so much so that if nothing else, this film will at least have you thinking about the choices you make by the time the credits role.  The main character, Judith, comes from a heavily religious upbringing, and for a woman that knew what she wanted in life, she finds herself being tempted fairly easily.  Her career is stuck in neutral and her marriage has gone stale, so she's easily tempted by the idea of someone new, and especially someone that has the ability to fast-track her career.  At one point, her mother even steps in to say she's being tempted by the devil, which will only lead her to pain and suffering.  In the end, Judith makes her own decisions and has to live with them.  However, if all Judith did was make the right decisions, it would make for a pretty uninteresting film.  And, unfortunately - the theme is the only plausible concept to take away from this poorly executed film.

To be honest, I couldn't tell where the plot of this film was headed, but that's mainly because I didn't really care.  These characters are far too full of themselves, worried too much about what they look like, and simply fail to make viewers care about what happens to them.  In the end, there is a pretty sad and significant twist to the direction of this film - but it's an unemotional twist that will simply make you shrug your shoulders.  It's not because the situation isn't sad (because it is), it's that the ""care"" factor is nonexistent by the time the climax comes to pass, leaving nothing more than borderline hate and mistrust for a character that should have made better choices.  At the same time, this film isn't called ""redemption,"" so that should clue you in to what these characters have to look forward to in this lengthy monstrosity.

There's no doubt about it - Temptation would be better suited for Lifetime instead of the big screen.  The film is completely devoid of a strong acting presence, and stars a bunch of actors/actresses that you've probably never heard of or will most likely end up on daytime television.  After all, the fact that Kim Kardashian is in the film should tip you off right away that the value of this film's cast is seriously lacking in quality.  Are you serious?  Kim Kardashian is the ""best"" actress (and I say that with complete sarcasm) available to play a role that served absolutely no point to begin with?  If a film begins with a clean slate (meaning an A+), and has to work to keep that grade (which very few films in the history of movie-making have ever achieved), a film will automatically drop 4 letter grades just for casting Kim Kardashian in a role.  It doesn't matter if it's for 15 minutes or 15 seconds, because she offers absolutely nothing to everything.  If there were ever a more worthless person to entertain you, I'm drawing a blank as to who would beat her.

The underlying message of this film is simply to think about your choices before you go and ruin your life.  However, for anyone that has an appreciation for the sanctity of marriage, this film will completely slap you in the face.  On the other hand, if you're into greedy, envious people that have no backbone or willpower, you'll probably dig this film.  Still, save yourself two hours and don't watch this movie.  It shouldn't take some pointless Lifetime knockoff drivel (or the money it costs to watch it) to make you think about your choices in life.  But, if you don't believe me - at least do yourself a favor and wait for this film to show up in the bargain bin before you go overspending on it.  If you pay $15 dollars to own it, odds are it will be the most expensive coaster you own.

Actually, all though this was mainly an all African-American cast, the story could be any woman's story no matter the financial standing or race.  Being swept off your feet by a billionaire or an everyday working man happens.  It addresses the root of something that is true for most women - we want to feel like our spouse, significant other ""sees"" us and values us.  While some women would have swooned over having a husband that idolizes you but doesn't express himself passionately towards you may not bother some it will others.  Being ""caught up"" with too much attention and falling into temptation is not a topic anyone wants to talk about.  If anything, I wish the movie developed the characters a little more and honestly I was wanting more.  I think the cast did wonderful, Kim played herself well because she was comfortable being herself :), but conversations weren't so off from believable as in some of Tyler's earlier productions.  The dialogue was better between characters.  I enjoyed this movie and I didn't think it came off preachy or anything.  It just told one woman's story - and to be truthful we don't always elaborate on the most hurtful of things - and she told a story that made you think at the end.  period.",1372377600,12,1371,4.643153526970955

Long Story Short: Judith (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) - a Christian- raised woman - and her husband Brice (Lance Gross) are trying to make it in the City of Washington after abandoning the country side. But when Judith starts working at a match-making company and has to deal with a new client who is not only charming but owns a billion dollar business, she gets trapped in a net of lust and temptation.

Review: I duck the concept of the movie and I thought the trailer looked very dramatic. But boy, was I fooled. First of all, I think making a PG-13 movie with this specific topic is just senseless, because there can't be any violence, swearing or nudity, and that's what this movie needs. I don't know where Tyler Perry tried to go with this story, it could have been so great, I mean there was definitely potential, but the first half was just a lot of talking, the second half was just over-the top, everything happened too fast, and suddenly it was over. The characters didn't get the chance to blossom or develop, which, sadly, didn't even make me feel sorry for any of the characters. This movie was advertising with relatively known actors like Kim Kardashian - which I know I didn't watch it for because she is completely talent- free, bless her little heart - Vanessa Williams or Brandy Norwood, and it was a commercial success, however, as a movie it failed in my opinion and is definitely one of Tyler Perry's weakest movies ever. I appreciated his movies in the past but his recent work is a huge disappointment.
Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor is a bad representation of Tyler Perry's work because he is a talented producer, but he doesn't show it recently.

5609098,2,B00BEL4QFO,"I've been a fan of Tyler Perry since his early staged plays featuring ""Madea"".  This film is poised and carried by great acting with the lead character played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell, however it is extremely cliche' to say the least. Great message, but the film's repetitive storyline dismisses the seemingly slow building plot. It takes an hour for the film to develop, and by that time it's over with. The plot is highly predictable. With a few changes, this could have been a 3-Star film. Great laughs, credible acting, and poignant story line makes it enough to actually finish watching the film. I wish he had developed his characters a little more and Lance Gross' acting was subpar.",1372377600,5,689,4.838983050847458
5609099,5,B00BEL4QFO,"A great movie that many people in this day and age should see, check where your life an relationship are at it may help you in the long run.",1372032000,,140,3.8620689655172415
5609100,5,B00BEL4QFO,"Absolutely amazing movie!!!  One of my favorite Tyler Perry films.  Dark at times, but a wonderful story with great actors.",1371945600,,123,5.1
5609101,5,B00BEL4QFO,This is a movie that the generation of women today should watch. This movie will show you how life can be in the long run for someone who is unappreciative and easy fooled by materialistic things.,1371686400,,196,4.472222222222222
5609102,4,B00BEL4QFO,"This movie caught me completely off guard. I was not expecting the movie to have such suspense and trailblazing acting. Honestly I was getting a little bored with Tyler Perry's predictable movie scripts and repetitive use of the same characters. Everything was well thought out from the very beginning. Tyler Perry stepped out the box on this one!

The storyline is based off of his play The Marriage Counselor. The movie starts out about a couple starting their lives together and learning how to live on their own. Life sends some unexpectant curves their way and they must learn to depend on each other or life will pull them a part. The wife is intrigued by this handsome man who promises to give her everything money can buy. Pretty soon she is caught up in a world full of sex, money, and drugs.",1371340800,,801,4.601398601398602
5609103,5,B00BEL4QFO,"This is an amazing movie with tons of twists and surprises. My FAVORITE Tyler Perry movie to date! At first I thought it would be horrible with a Kardashian in it, but her part is very little and everyone in the theatre made several ""WOW"" out loud comments because it is full of surprises. Cannot wait for it to come out on DVD.",1370304000,,328,4.222222222222222
5609104,5,B00BEL4QFO,"This movie is Tyler Perry's best production to date!  All of the actors and actresses, Robbie Jones, Lance Gross, Jurnee Smollett, were amazing in their performances!! Like most of Perry's movies, there is also a message and a moral.  A must see!!",1369872000,19,247,4.857142857142857
5609105,4,B00BEL4QFO,"This was my first Tyler Perry film and I made sure I was there on opening day since the previews looked amazing.  This movie brings something to light that happens on a daily basis in a lot of lives, maybe mine, maybe yours?  It makes you think about the decisions we all make on a daily basis when it comes to relationships.  While, it does outline many reasons transgressions happen, it throws you for a HUGE loop.  I cried through most of this film and cannot wait to buy it and loan it to my girlfriends so they have the same chance to examine their choices I did.",1369785600,24,568,4.231481481481482
5609116,5,B00BEL4QFO,"The best Tyler Perry movie with a message so deep you question yourself, relationship, & your choices. I saw this when it came out at the movies & cried through most of it. Cant wait for it to come out on dvd.",1369008000,,209,4.0
5609117,5,B00BEL4QFO,"This movie is an eye opener for women. It is inspirational, beautiful and teaches a lot about what happens in life. All that glitters is indeed not Gold. The devil tries to place the beautiful things of life in front of us when it obviously doesn't last..... It also teaches us patience and not to be carried away by material things.
As for Kim kardasian, I would say she did a very nice job, for someone who really isn't an actress professional, I was impressed.",1368921600,22,463,4.458823529411765
5609118,4,B00BEL4QFO,"I thought it would be predictable and everyone told me to wait, glad I saw it, very realistic and very message filled.  Makes you think about your decisions you make and to be led of God before making them.

5609119,5,B00BEL4QFO,The movie was well put together and EVERY couple should see it! Tyler Perry has done a great job putting this real-life senario on the big screen. The subject manner that was covered in the movie is one that can happen and often does happen due to neglect of seeking help for your relationship.,1365724800,6,294,4.462962962962963
5609120,4,B00BEL4QFO,"I understand what the detractors are saying about the negative potrayals of black men. But, I have learned that was as the viewers are a little more maturer than that and must give Tyler a pass. I must admit that I was impressed how entertaining and inspirational I CAN DO BAD ALL BY MYSELF was but disappointed at FOR COLOUR GIRLS...( not as much for the generally black male bashing but the forced and annoying poetic monologues ). Like many of his detractors, when I first noticed a trailer for ""another one of those Tyler Perry movies"" - initially I was reluctant. But, after viewing the trailer particularly with an all-star cast ( the chemistry, the real world situations, etc. ) - I was floored! Some detractors were even saying that Kim K. shouldn't be in it and that her acting seemed emotionless. I say cut both Tyler and Kim some slack. And, the core of Tyler's movies is about MORALITY. I can't wait to see a  Jurnee all grown up, Lance Gross, Robbie Jones, Ella Joyce, etc. in this  drama which is to date receiving a lot of great reviews!!!!",1365206400,,1055,4.518324607329843
5609121,2,B00BEL4QFO,"The characters in this slow-moving, drag-along drama where all derived from a cesspool of simplicity and naivet. Although the theme of the film is relatable, the execution of its poorly-written storyline leaves a lot to be desired for a big screen, well-promoted release like this.

Tyler Perry's ""Temptation"" is preachy and bland, unlike T.D. Jake's (STRAIGHT-TO-DVD release)""Woman Thou Art Loosed: On the 7th Day"", which is suspenseful with the wicked elements of deception and vengeance, along with the religion and faith-based commentary that both Perry and Jake's films often entails.  I use this comparison because after viewing the (wickedly-good) trailer for ""Temptation"" over the past 2 months, I expected at least the good-entertainment equivalence of the T.D. Jake's film that I watched in the comfort of my own home.....  (Besides, watching a film full of simple characters in a theater full of noisy, simple-minded folks is a challenge within itself!)

The lesson learned is PATIENCE!!!  My expectations for any of Tyler Perry's newer releases (post: ""A Family That Preys"" being my last purchase) should be low enough to wait until it's released on DVD... And then of course, I'd just borrow the DVD from a relative or friend.",1365206400,7,1239,5.237373737373737
5609122,3,B00BEL4QFO,"This is a story about modern lives, something most of us have experienced from one side of the coin or another. Bryce (Lance Gross) and Judith (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) have been together since childhood in a good Christian relationship. As work wears them down, they become content, if not boring as Bryce forgets her birthday...again. Bryce is very straight. Judith wants to experiment and grow. When Judith meets a man who listens to her and says all the right things she becomes tempted, hence the title of the film.

The film moves slow. It builds character. Since it is a Tyler Perry production, the dialouge is mildly humorous with Kim Kardashian giving Judith fashion advice. Perhaps the best way to describe it would be a Christian soap opera, light on the religion. At times the lines and situation appears stiff and forced as Judith comes out of character.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. Off screen implied sex. The thing missing from this film was The Free Movement's ""I've Found Someone Of My Own"" during the closing credits.",1365206400,,1043,4.887005649717514
5609123,5,B00BEL4QFO,"I went to see this movie ""Temptation"" on Friday opening day and this movie to me was ""Awesome"" Tyler Perry did a Awesome job and the cast in this movie was ""Awesome"" too, full of surprises make you think twice about things. ""Temptation"" is worth seeing and I can't wait to buy the movie.",1364601600,60,287,4.333333333333333
5609124,5,B00BEL4QFO,"This movie was awsume i was so excited to see the movie,cant wait to own this one it will add to my tyler perry collection that i have,im never diappointed with tyler perrys work,i especially love his plays,may God countinue to bless him,as long as he always keeps jesus first in jesus mighty name amen",1364601600,21,302,4.509090909090909
5609125,5,B00BEL4QFO,"his only other movie that can even be mentioned in the same sentence is Alex Cross. This movie is something that anyone who is in a relationship, thinking about being in a relationship, wanting more out of your current relationship, or even if you consider yourself to be a ""garden tool"", it was written especially for you. The ending is UNBELIEVEABLE! I would rate that ending as one that will be talked about for quite sometime.",1364601600,11,430,4.671052631578948
