8335132,5,B001Q7A8P8,"After enjoying their music for a few years now, it was great to finally see the Sons of the San Joaquin performing live - getting a feel for what they are like in person. Down here in New Zealand we are really starved of all kinds of Country & Western music, both on radio and in music stores. I stumbled onto the Songs of the Silver Screen CD in a second-hand music shop years ago and have been a big fan ever since. I have always enjoyed cowboy music, don't really know why but with every song I always seem to picture an image of the West with me in it - crazy really because down here in the South Pacific is nothing like the old Wild West, and I've never ridden a horse. Perhaps it was Rawhide and all the old western TV shows and movies I gre up on.

I guess the Sons will never come to perform in this part of the world, so this concert showing them live is the next best thing for me.

Outstanding - one of my favourites.",1245628800,10,929,4.0162162162162165
