4384052,5,B004I6KDJ0,the interaction between mark and his guest singers is fun and full of stories.  the songs are sung with emotion and draws you into the message each one has.  mark has a great teaching moment for believers and non-believers alike.  i am so glad i bought this c.d. !!,1315958400,7,265,4.36734693877551
4384053,4,B004I6KDJ0,I must not have read the Amazon description too closely so I was a little disappointed. Mark Lowry is a singer and a comedian. With the album title I thought it was going to be mostly comedy but it was mostly singing. Still it's very good. I was just really in the mood for some of his comedy.,1309737600,6,293,4.068965517241379
4384054,4,B004I6KDJ0,While this is a great DVD of mark singing. Most people might be turned off as mark doesn't tell any of his funny stories. But If you want to hear him singing at his best. This DVD is for you!,1309651200,8,191,3.8
4384055,5,B004I6KDJ0,"It's been 5 years since Mark's last solo video, Goes to Hollywood, so I was anxious to get this one. When I heard the details I looked forward to it even more. I've been to many of Mark's solo concerts over the last 5 years and this one captures the essence of what happens. No two of his concerts are the same, so the title fits his style perfectly! The simple style, sitting around the piano with the group that he toured with for so long gives the intimacy that makes the message and the music even more powerful. The teamwork with Stan Whitmire on piano, Kim & Michael Lord, Amber Baltzglier, and Kim's sisters Valerie and Heather can't be beat. Seeing the whole team back together again and hearing a few of the stories from the road was lots of fun. One of the most special moments is seeing Mark sing with his mother Beverly and some of the stories that he tells in the introduction.

My only complaint about the video is that it isn't long enough! I would have loved for it to be at least twice as long.

If anybody was looking to buy just one of Mark's videos I'd definitely say get this one. You won't regret getting it!",1295740800,24,1130,4.275700934579439

4384061,3,B004I6KDJ0,I thought it was going to be comedy because that's what I like best about Mark Lowery. I wanted to share it w/ my grandson who likes Marks comedy. I'm keeping it anyway to not bother w/ shipping it back.,1366416000,4,203,4.1

4384065,5,B004I6KDJ0,"If you have been patiently, anticipating a new DVD from Mark Lowry, then I can honestly say that ""unplugged and unplanned"" has been worth the wait! It is Mark at his best, and in his element! From the upbeat ""House of Gold"" to everyone's all time favorite hymns, ""In The Garden"", this DVD has something for everyone, from start to finish. If you love hearing Mark sing with his ""Mama"" then you will love the Dottie Rambo song, ""Promises"". Bev Lowry sings beautifully, and I can't forget Stan Whitmire's fantastic work on the piano. Stan does a great job on all the songs. I loved the message of the song ""Nothing To Prove"", and Mark's duet with Amber Balltzlier is wonderful, on the beautiful ""I've Never Been Out Of His Care"", as is Mark's duet with Kim Lord on ""Going Home"". Amber & Kim have beautiful voices that just make a song come alive, but I have to admit the most touching song for me on this DVD is The Sisters singing ""I'm Gonna Make It"". It will bring you to tears as it did me. I have to admit I wasn't expecting to be touched as much as I was, both by the music and by the interaction of all those in the studio. That interaction between the songs, and the songs themselves, bring a message of God's love to the listener. Then of course, that shouldn't be a surprise, being that you can't be around Mark very long, without hearing the message of God's love & grace!",1334448000,6,1380,4.332046332046332
