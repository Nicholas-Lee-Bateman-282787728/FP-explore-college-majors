8105170,5,B000E3K79M,"John Miller, not only a master guitar player is a fine instructer and as humble and unassuming as they come given that he IS a master and his recordings going back a long time when he was a younger man demonstrate this fully. As well his taste. He recognizes and plays good interesting and often complex tunes with  often delectable melodies and has unveiled the talent and feel of guitarists like Bo Carter and in this case Wilkins who otherwise suffer from some neglect in overall attention.
Miller is big on the role of timing (counting)in Country Blues Guitar as he himself says is probably the most important thing he derived from his interest in this genre on his DVD with Stefan Grossman and Buster B. Jones. Easily neglected, this discipline helps to expand competence in the genre. Wilkin's pieces can be built on if you pass by the voice accompanying. Miller's gift is that he can sing (and enjoys singing)to often complex guitar playing when the instrumental mastering is often enough to us mere mortals.
Stefan Grossman, who himself is a master and engaging instructer should be acknowledged for engaging such fine artists as Miller and others as part of the Guitar Workshop.",1314576000,,1187,4.818627450980392
