It's about older people in a nursing home who find a new independence when a doctor is ""sentenced"" to six months as the resident physician there after being arrested for insurance fraud. I had never heard of it until I flipped the channel while I was on my treadmill and there it was! I was working with Senior citizens at the time and since I could not find the movie at the library, I went to Amazon online and bought it. Great decision! It is funny, charming, and heartwarming, the kind of movie you can watch with your grandmother. Yes, it's a PG so you'll have to miss out on all the noise, cussing, violence, and gratuitous sex. But I think you'll like it anyway.",1362614400,,708,4.412213740458015
8292741,4,B001DD6A1Q,The show was nice. Not a blockbuster but it was a great find. We saw this on Netflix and I had to get the DVD of it for the family. My whole family liked it and Amazon almost always has items the cheapest. I would recommend it to everyone.,1361404800,,239,3.8979591836734695
8292742,1,B001DD6A1Q,"My wife and I gave it about 30 minutes and decided to give up on this stinker.  This movie had all the professional qualities of something a group of amateurs would produce with rented equipment in a garage.  Acting, dialogue, video production all stunk.  The story line had potential but the overall poor quality of every other aspect of this film made trying to watch it a total waste of time.  Very bad.",1235606400,2,406,4.52054794520548
8292743,4,B001DD6A1Q,"Overall a good film.  Emmanuelle Chriqui is gorgeous as usual.  It is a feel good movie with some very cute acting performances.  I purchased it as a gift for my grandparents, cuz I think they will appreciate the comedy and the message.  There were some predictable aspects in the plot, but I don't think it was trying to reinvent the wheel.  I give it a four out of five stars, and would reccomend it to anyone that enjoys light feel good comedies.",1224028800,4,449,4.426829268292683
8292744,5,B001DD6A1Q,"It was funny and yet true to life as we get old and how many seniors are treated by their own family members are cast aside. This movie showed that
love and caring and comedy goes a long way in this thing we call life.",1222732800,4,218,3.8666666666666667
8292745,5,B001DD6A1Q,"This is the first movie in along time that I can say I enjoyed watching  from start to finish.  It has a good story line and a cast that works well together. I look forward to seeing future works by the lead actor, Robert Capelli Jr, he has a genuine quality about him that is lacking in actors today.",1222646400,4,301,4.084745762711864
8292746,5,B001DD6A1Q,"I saw this movie when it was in the theatre, and I loved it.  Its about time it is available to the public.  It's a movie that makes you feel many emotions and keeps your interest through out,unlike alot of movies out now.  During the movie you experience happiness, saddness, anger and even suprise at times.  It is a good down to earth, original movie, and I highly recommend it.",1222300800,5,381,4.4
