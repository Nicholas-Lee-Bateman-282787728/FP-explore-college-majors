4327915,4,B004COGSAG,This video is a bit dry in its format but has some good insights and information. Not a video you want to watch with the family and popcorn. ;),1307232000,8,143,3.9655172413793105
4327916,5,B004COGSAG,"I got this DVD as a Mother's Day gift... LOVE IT!!  It was SO encouraging!  I'm already a better mother because of encouragement I got from this DVD.  There's basically three parts, 1) an interview time with Michelle Duggar where she answers questions about motherhood as well as practical things about how she homeschools, handles chores for her large family, etc.  The most profound part of this is the mothering advice she gives.  She even sings a little song saying ""The joy of the Lord is my strength"" and she sings so beautifully, it melts your heart.  She talks about praising your children, and her personal hurtful experience with the birth control pill.  2) Jim Bob Duggar is interviewed and answers questions about how he leads and protects his family.  3) Part three is a ceremony where they play a really neat video in honor of Michelle and present her with a ""Mother of the Year"" award for impacting millions of people with the JOY of motherhood.  Watching their tv show (which Michelle points out that it's not a ""show,"" it's their life) is a lot of FUN and I've learned different things just by seeing how they live, but this DVD goes deeper and you see more of their heart.  I've also read their book ""The Duggar's 20 and Counting"" and it is EXCELLENT as well!  Hope you buy this DVD!!  Husbands, BUY this for your wife!  Mommies need all the godly encouragement we can get!",1305158400,109,1391,4.582995951417004
4327917,5,B004COGSAG,Very nice to listen to the calming voice of Michelle Duggar.  Learned a lot from this dvd I would recommend this book for all to read.,1379116800,8,134,4.153846153846154
4327918,5,B004COGSAG,"I am always encouraged by watching any episode of 19 Kids and Counting, but this is just a wonderful addition and insight into the heart and transparency of Michelle Duggar. It's something great to have on hand to share with mothers, friends and family. Michelle offers so much wisdom, godly wisdom and I have greatly enjoyed this DVD and will for years to come.",1343347200,2,362,4.671875
4327919,5,B004COGSAG,"This video was very encouraging for mothers, especially when they're in the middle of raising children for the Kingdom of God. I bought it for my married daughter and she loved it.",1333756800,,180,4.65625
4327920,5,B004COGSAG,"This is a great gift! I have watched it several times, shared with a friend -who also loved it- and my only complaint is that I never want it to end! Wonderful, helpful and encouraging. A thousand stars!",1330214400,,203,4.368421052631579
4327921,5,B004COGSAG,This is a terrific DVD. Michelle is such an amazing person with so much wizdom. I strive to be more like her. I am always interested in anything she has to say. This is a great DVD for any fan of the Duggar family!,1329782400,,214,3.8863636363636362
4327922,5,B004COGSAG,"This DVD was/is very encouraging to me as a new mom! I have been a fan of the Duggars for a while now, and am so blessed and encouraged by Michelle Duggar's godly example! It is so refreshing! This DVD was a blessing!",1327708800,13,217,4.069767441860465
4327923,3,B004COGSAG,"I bought this because I have always respected the Duggar family. I think their parenting is good, and that they have tons of wisdom to share. I was hoping for a video that was a more fun and relaxed atmosphere, but this video is quite boring. There are some wonderful insights in it from Michelle, but overall it's not all that good. It is not something I would watch more then once.",1323734400,3,383,4.333333333333333
4327924,5,B004COGSAG,"I love the Duggars! They help me to keep my focus in raising my children. This video has lots of behind the scene info, but I do wish it was longer, but that is true with and thing Duggar, I always want more!!",1323043200,10,209,3.883720930232558
4327925,5,B004COGSAG,I enjoyed this DVD. I love hearing how different people live and this really gives some great insight into the decisions and lives of the Duggars on a more personal level than you see on the reality show.,1321488000,11,204,4.394736842105263
4327926,4,B004COGSAG,"This is a lovely little visit with Michelle.  As much as I do love her, the dvd is a little amateurish and has a lot of information that is already available on her show and in her books.  My favorite part of this is listening to her sing ""The Joy of Lord Is My Strength.""  Very pleasant.",1319068800,11,288,4.017543859649122

8423311,5,B004COGSAG,"Endearing and encouraging. Her singing voice has stayed with me since I first watched this movie. It is a quiet, calm video good for watching while cooking, or driving, or just doing chores. Children may enjoy it as well, as it is simply sweet to hear a joyful woman.",1482451200,,267,4.469387755102041
8423312,1,B004COGSAG,"This is pure ignorance at it's worst!  If there ever was proof of how dangerous religious fanaticism can be, this is it!",1476489600,,120,4.454545454545454
8423313,5,B004COGSAG,This was a DVD I hadn't known about. It was very interesting and I enjoyed an opportunity to listen to Michelle (and Jim Bob at the end of the DVD) talk and answer questions.,1436054400,,174,4.147058823529412
8423314,5,B004COGSAG,Would recommend.,1422144000,,16,7.5

8423317,5,B004COGSAG,"Given as a gift, my daughter has dreams of a large family and is inspired by the Duggars.
Four children is plenty for my daughter but Michelle has wonderful encouragement and ideas that keep my daughter encouraged.",1398384000,3,214,4.8108108108108105
8423318,5,B004COGSAG,This family is such an amazing inspiration. This actually had me chocking up which surprised me because I don't generally cry during shows. But it's not all sad! It's funny too and she gives great advice.,1390608000,5,204,4.694444444444445
8423319,5,B004COGSAG,What a blessing this video has been!  My family appreciates the Duggars and their Christ honoring testimony.  They are a good example/roll model for both mature and old Christians.,1389225600,,180,5.172413793103448
