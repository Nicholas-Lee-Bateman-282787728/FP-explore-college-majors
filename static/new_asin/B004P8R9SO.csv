4444038,2,B004P8R9SO,"Although I have promised myself that I do not buy cavalry versus Indian westerns I did it again. I blame those five stars given to this film. I am always at the side of the Indians which makes it difficult to find that the cavalry is on time again. The romantic triangles between the soldiers are not very interesting and took a lot of time. There was a lot of talk that did not get my interest. I do like Robert Taylor. He was the best thing in this film. At least in my DVD the night scenes were too dark. The locations were great and the final skirmishes were O.K., but when one is rooting for the Indians, one is going to be disappointed in the end. I can stand the Ford films, because they are so well made.",1335484800,4,712,4.0928571428571425

4444040,5,B004P8R9SO,"""Ambush"" is an excellent example of how a modest story can become an outstanding film with care and attention to it's casting, production values and direction. A small surveying party is wiped out by Apaches and one women in it is still presumed to be alive. The local U.S army post commander {Leon Ames} is ordered to try to rescue her with the captives sister Ann Duveral {Arlene Dahl} being the prime instigator in pushing forward the rescue effort - no matter what!

Robert Taylor plays Ward Kinsman - a pragmatic frontiersman and {sometime}army scout who wants no part of what he considers a hopeless effort will cost the lives of 15-20 troopers with small chance that the captive will found alive. He gradually [if reluctantly} comes around to accept the commission to scout for the rescue mission due to a growing attraction to Ms Duveral while in competition with a tough, ""by the book"" officer"" {John Hodiak} both who mutually loathe, yet respect one other.

There is an interesting subplot involving an junior officer {Don Taylor}and a enlisted man's wife {Jean Hagen} and also present as Kismen's grizzeled sidekick/buddy ""Holly"" is veteran character actor John McIntire. The performances by all the actors/actresses are uniformly excellent. Jean Hagen as the beaten down married laundress and John Hodiak as the ""too perfect officer"" are espiscally good. Robert Taylor is perfectly cast as the cynical weather beaten Kinsmen with Taylor downplaying his matinee/idol looks and in a brief ""fisticuff's"" with J.Hodiak has some of his self assurance speedily knocked out of him !!

The climamtic battles are well conceived and excellently presented. The movie was filmed almost entirely on location, not the backlot and the grit, dust and dirt of it is refeshingly opposite of the usual MGM polished production. One small critcism is the lack of grit/dirt for Ann Duveral character. Arlene Dahl is far too sleek, coffiured, made up, and drop dead gorgeous for this frontier backwater to be completly believable. That aside, she gives a nice performance and she does look spectacular !!

Sam Wood was {and is} a well regarded director from the silent films of 1920s thru movies of all genres thru the 1930s -40s and in his last directorial credit {he passed away in 1949} he wrings every last drop of entertainment value from the storyline. This is a really excellent film with the entire cast and director all giving of their best. I liked this film and I give it an enthusiastic 4 1/2 star rating.",1314403200,25,2506,4.945368171021378
4444041,5,B004P8R9SO,"This is one of the best westerns ever made.  Sadly, the coming 1950's witnessed a succession of dreamlike westerns in tune with the escapism of the time.  'Ambush' is excellent on all counts.  It is period accurate and follows nicely Luke Short story.  Of course, it is Sam Wood's genious. One of the few westerns from that era showing the unbelievable cruelty of the Apaches.  In my opinion, it rivals 'The Searchers'.",1306454400,44,419,4.763888888888889
4444042,4,B004P8R9SO,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) presents ""AMBUSH"" (1950) (89 min/B&W) -- Starring Robert Taylor, John Hodiak, Arlene Dahl, Don Taylor & Jean Hagen

Directed by Sam Wood

Ward Kinsman (Robert Taylor) is an Indian scout, who with Frank Holly (John McIntire) narrowly escapes from a savage band of Apaches. Arriving at the fort, Ward learns that the Army is about to set out on a recue mission: a young woman has been captured by the same Apache band. Even though he knows it will cost lives Ward agrees to scout for the mission. The woman's sister, Ann Duverall (Arlene Dahl) is also slated to join the rescue group - a situation which complicates matters since Ward has concerns for her safety but he definitely has eyes for her

Ambush is a tight, well-paced western, expertly assembled by veteran director Sam Wood.

From the novel by Luke Short - he also wrote Ramrod (1947), Blood on the Moon (1948), Station West (1948), Coroner Creek (1948), Albuquerque (1948), Ride the Man Down (1952) & Hell's Outpost (1954).

Special footnote: -- This was the last film of director Sam Wood who possibly because of his right wing political views is not as well remembered today as a lot of his contemporaries. He received three nominations for Best Director for Kitty Foyle, Goodbye Mr. Chips and King's Row. He did such other classics as Pride of the Yankees, A Day At the Races, A Night at the Opera and Our Town -- That's a pretty good track record.

4444052,2,B004P8R9SO,"Hey there, I am giving this 2 stars for the pricing policy and the fact these are DVD-Rs and not pressed,  but the quality of the film I give a 4 to 5 stars. This film is a really good movie, I think it was Robert Taylor's 2nd western and I really like Robert Taylor in a western. Now other folks on here have given good reviews on it and do a better job than I can, but don't you guys think the price of $19.95 is too high for a non-pressed dvd? At least Warner Archives runs theirs on sale on their site at $11 to $13.00 once in a while, but I have never seen MGM or 20th Cent. Fox discount theirs DVD-Rs more than 10%. I have collected movies for many years on VHS, Laser Discs and DVDs, but I think these should be in the $10 to $12 range before I will buy any more of them. If they were pressed, then the price point of $19.99 to $25 would be fair, but not for a copy that will not last, one small scratch and it is dead and done for and you will have to pay another $20 for it to be replaced.",1348704000,9,998,3.798076923076923

8437572,4,B004P8R9SO,"There is something arbitrary about how films are remembered.  This one mostly is not, but it is actually a good film that strives to weave a multi-faceted plotline that doesn't insult the intelligence of adults.  The B-movies were for kids and featured cowboys in pressed pants, but this one has beard stubble on the hero, and you first meet him in dirty clothing.  The action sequences are very well done, and the black-and-white photography runs from so-so when depicting things at night to excellent in scenery shots.  The best of those were from near Gallup, new Mexico.  The characters are out to retrieve a captive white woman from the Apache.  There are petty rivalries, stumbling romance (most are), and conflicted characters.  This one is not well remembered because Hollywood leftists carry grudges to the grave, and Robert Taylor was a staunch anti-Communist and chum of Ronald Reagan.  It's all I can figure.  Taylor oozes Alpha Male but doesn't strain credulity, as does much of John Wayne's material.  Don't let the not-so-great packaging fool you.  This one is right up there with Budd Boetticher / Randolph Scott's best, and better than many well known Westerns.  there is a reason for the Western fad in the fifties.  Films like this may be part of it.",1450396800,6,1269,4.901408450704225
