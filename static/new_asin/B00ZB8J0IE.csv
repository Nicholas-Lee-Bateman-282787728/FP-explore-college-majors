7275728,5,B00ZB8J0IE,"First of all I would like to mention the quality of the image and sound, is superb. This movie was made in 1962 and you will never notice that, what a great job doing the transfer.

The Villian of the movie get's killed by fire when the movie starts and swears to come back and kill the descendants of those who took his life, and no he is not Freddy Krueger ;)

Two hundred years later he comes back to fulfill his promise. Of course this time he can transform himself into a ""horrible"" monster, of course is a very cheesy one and it will make you laugh a lot, This classic has all the elements of a fun campy horror movie, cheesy monster and FX's, some bad acting, some not that bad acting and specially ""The Look"", you will understand it when you watch it :D",1158537600,11,761,4.170068027210885
7275729,4,B00ZB8J0IE,"CasaNegra continues it's top-notch quality preservation of old Mexican horror films with ""El Baron del Terror"" or ""Brainiac"". The film is absolutely ridiculous, cheaply made but beautifully shot in gorgeous b&w. And it's this wonderful quality that CasaNegra preserves. The print is immaculate, enabling you to see fine details like the unbelievably cheap sets and the unbelievably cheap ""comet"" that brings our monster ""el baron"" to earth 300 years after he was burned alive for heresy, debauchery, sorcery and so on. One thing must be said, though, the story is imaginative. But the baron (played by the producer Abel Salazar), in monster form, is one of the screen's most ludicrous looking things I've ever seen. He's hysterical. And likes brains, which we won't get into because he keeps them unrefridgerated and, well, nobody seemed to catch that they would SMELL after a while? Anyway, this is a fun film that's enjoyable to watch in such beautiful, sharp condition and to savor and share with your friends who also might enjoy hoots like this. The dialogue is not to be missed either. Says a detective, ""A maniac with knowledge is a threat.""  Hmmm...guess so.  Please enjoy!",1157068800,11,1181,5.051282051282051
7275730,5,B00ZB8J0IE,"FINALLY, an excellent-quality DVD of this ""so-bad-it's-good"" Mexican horror film!

  Previously available DVDs have been of HORRIBLE quality, so much so as to be nearly unwatchable.

  CasaNegra's new release is first-rate. I won't outline the plot here because other reviewers have done it already and probably much better than I could.

  In fact, that's one thing that bugs me about many DVD reviews, here and elsewhere; mainly, too much time spent recounting an already-familiar plot and not enough time devoted to commenting on the QUALITY of a particular DVD release. I don't need to hear a synopsis of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" for the millionth time, I want to know how the new, colorized version compares with previous releases on DVD.

  Back to the topic at hand. CasaNegra Entertainment scores on all fronts! So far I've purchased all 4 of their releases: ""Curse Of The Crying Woman,"" ""The Witch's Mirror,"" ""The Brainiac,"" and ""Black Pit Of Dr. M."" I've watched the first three, and they do not disappoint. The source prints are excellent. All include original Spanish soundtracks with optional English subtitles, and optional English-dubbed soundtracks as well as audio commentaries.

  The only reasons I didn't give this one 5 stars are:

1.) Given CasaNegra's obvious dedication to this genre, they should have caught the misspelling of ""bizarre"" as ""bizzare"" in the ""bonus"" essay on the film. But given that the author is listed as ""Casamiro Buenavista"" (if that is indeed the author's  real name), one might surmise that the individual is Hispanic, in which case I am virtually certain that his English far surpasses my Spanish, so perhaps I am being too picky on this detail. Still, if I were CasaNegra I would have corrected it.

and

2.) There is a segment during the dubbed English soundtrack where the dubbing inexplicably disappears and we are left to puzzle over the translation, at least until/unless we turn on the optional English subtitles. This occurs during a couple of the other CasaNegra titles as well.

  Come to think of it, that may be a little too picky also.

  So, never mind, I'm giving this one five stars! Buy it!

  And also check out Ultratumba Productions' model kit, ""El Baron Del Terror""! (GOOGLE ""Ultratumba Productions"" and ""El Baron Del Terror."")",1156982400,8,2297,4.989445910290238
7275731,5,B00ZB8J0IE,"Boy, do I remember this one! I was 9 years old and rabid for anything having to do with monsters / horror. I snuck downstairs every late-late friday / saturday night (while my unsuspecting parents slept) to catch the latest fright fest on the local creature feature show. One night, there it was, THE BRAINIAC! It had it all- Slackjawed dubbing, abominable ""acting"", and a monster that couldn't scare my great-granny! Yup, BRAINIAC is a true classic! I can see it's hilarious rubber claws wobbling! It's mask expanding and contracting w/ each breath of the poor guy trapped inside it! It's skull-piercing tongue, like a party favor of doom! If you've never seen BRAINIAC, you owe it to yourself to do so right away! You'll never forget it...",1156982400,2,741,4.796875

8719754,4,B00ZB8J0IE,"I saw this as a kid on a Spanish TV network. I watched the whole thing not understanding Spanish very well but still getting the basic gist of an evil warlock who comes to 50s Mexico to suck your brain out of your head with his demon tongue.

All joking aside, I know Spanish better now and thankfully the DVD has subtitles. It's still a pretty basic movie but it's also really good. Visually, they have striking images like a bowl full of brains and a man in a suit with a flame thrower walking through a castle. It sounds silly but it works well in practice.

The casting is kind of perfect in a visual sense. Once you see the villain, you'll immediately know. The hero and his love interest are in the same archetypal variety. Movies like this have a certain charm in that sense. You don't have to worry a joke is being played on you. It's probably for the best because like I said there's tons of whacky visual jokes like the Inquisition and men in suits with flame throwers.

Recommended to people who like old b-movies or movies with interesting visual moments",1408406400,,1066,4.401015228426396
8719755,4,B00ZB8J0IE,"Haven't seen this film in twenty-five years. It played on the USA Network on Commander USA's show. Anybody remember that one? Anyhow, I purchased the DVD and was not disappointed. Good fun. Abel Salazar was a handsome man who knew how to smooch. Got the usual horrible special effects and the comedy relief copper, but it's still good fun. Great fodder for a Friday afternoon at the movies.",1405641600,,390,4.75
8719756,5,B00ZB8J0IE,For horror buffs like me and fans of obscure gems such as this Mexican import I've got to say this - buy it! The price is worth it just for the bonus materials and packaging. This is no cheap release - it's quality and with crystal clear display on the film itself what else can I say. I highly recommend it.,1378684800,2,308,4.065573770491803
8719757,5,B00ZB8J0IE,"(Original title: El Baron del Terror) This low-budget Mexi-flick still isn't well-known in the ""B"" community, even after Sandra Bernard gave it the Reel Wild Cinema treatment - but I can't believe such superb badness has just one review! (Okay - Amazon is better, it has like 36 reviews...)

This brawny brain-sucker is not only the cheesy, sleazy equal of any American product from the same ilk and era, but the badly overdubbed Spanish gives it an especially weird look that actually contributes to the horror in parts... if you can be horrified while laughing yer head off. So naturally, Bookblaster has stopped carrying it. B fans, get busy! If you like schlock/drive-in horror, then LET THE FACE-PULSING BEGIN!",1341014400,,715,5.008403361344538
8719758,5,B00ZB8J0IE,"it's a dirty shane casanegra entertainment is no longer making these great mexican horror films on dvd.they were a great company who restored these movies to near perfection.this movie for example--the brainiac,made in 1962,has abel salazar for a change playing a real bad guy,who gets revenge on the judges who sentenced him to death back in 1661 by coming back to modern times and killing off one by one the descendants of the judges by sucking the brains out of,burning to death,and drowning in one case.i have all the casanegra dvds they made in 2006 and 2007 and unfortunately they are all out of print.they had scheduled 2 more great horror movies for release,""the living head"" and ""the world of the vampires"" but unfortunately this great company went out of business before they could be released.you can't go wrong with any of the casanegra dvds but to me this one is the most fun to watch.i hope one day casanegra entertainment will make a comeback--to have a company restore these lost classics to near perfection is rare nowadays,so let's keep our fingers crossed that someone purchases this great company and releases more great mexican horror movies the way they should be(and by the way they come with both english and spanish audio tracks).",1239753600,,1255,4.896713615023474

on such films like RE-ANIMATOR-EVIL DEAD-DEAD ALIVE and

films you have/have not seen. A executed sorcerer who returns
300 years after his death to seek revenge on the descendants
of his enemies by sucking their brains out with a foot-long
forked tongue while in form of a HIDEOUS MONSTER with inflatable
head!  I'm not making this up folks!  About as off-the-wall

8719760,3,B00ZB8J0IE,"The Brainiac is a movie so silly that Frank Zappa had to make references to it  in one of his songs!  And silly it is, in a kind of Mexican Plan 9 sort of way.  The plot is the whole heretic guy getting burned during the inquisition with the whole ""I curse you and your descendants"" thing.  Kinda like Bava's Black Sunday, but one thing Bava's film didn't have is a monster like this one.  Once the condemned Baron turns up again 300 years later, he basically looks normal until he decides to get down and dirty with revenge.  After hypnotizing his victims(an optical trick that makes his face blink like a vehicle's turn signal), he turns into...THE BRAINIAC.  The Brainiac looks like a kindergartener's attempt at making a troll mask complete with rubber forked tongue.  He's a hoot!  Unfortunately that's all the movie really has going for it.  The scenes in between have a few unintentional chuckles, but it's all rather boring.  The best scenes are when The Brainiac appears, and unfortunately, they go by a little too fast.  Regardless of it's shortcomings, I'd definitely recommend this movie to all fans of the schlocky and the bizarre.",1173139200,2,1144,4.722222222222222
8719761,5,B00ZB8J0IE,"This movie is absolutely incredible and styrange. In the 1987 many fans were introduced to this film when clips

from it were included on the home video release ""Zacherly's Horrable Horror'. At the time, the Brainiac had dissapeared from regular TV showings and, for many, this was all that could be seen. It was a revelation that blew our minds.  Clips showed a cone shaped rock drop from the sky and land flat. It then transformed into

a huge hairy headed creature with sucktion cup fingers who is depicted changing into a human and, incredibly,

sucking the brains out of victims with a probing tongue. All thw while his head is expanding and contracting like a Rob Bottin bladder effect. Amazing. Glad that I can now see the whole movie. Its mind blowing. Way ahead of its time. This creature was a radical departure from the standard vampires of the time. Its the Grandad of the Chupacabra.",1171670400,2,896,4.687898089171974
