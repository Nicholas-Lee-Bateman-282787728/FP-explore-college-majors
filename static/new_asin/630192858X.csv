7816869,5,630192858X,"This is a fascinating and well done movie. the innovative use of recreation, stock footage and interviews with the actual people  is well presented. The clash of cultures between the Judge who can't understand the ""young punk hippies"" as he might think of them and the young people who can't seem to understand how to act in court and only want to be able to express themselves.is quite clear throughout. I was riveted as the prosecution joined in with the attempt to have bobby seals gag removed. The attempt by the defendants to explain their opposition to the war certainly had my sympathy. Next moment you wanted to yell at them to act right so they don't get more jail time. I could sympathize with the judge who has never encountered such behavior in his life one minute. The next I was reminded that he seamed to have made up his mind against them from the beginning. I yelled many time he sustained that objection. As this is taken from the real trial transcript it would seem the defendants never had a fair trial",1519084800,,1022,4.554347826086956
7816870,5,630192858X,I had taped this movie when it showed on HBO years ago. I lost my VHS tape and was really upset because I think this movie shows a very inportant time in American history. I was very pleased to find it on DVD. The DVD is in excellent condition and the movie plays very well without any video or audio problems.,1461456000,,310,4.098360655737705

7816872,5,630192858X,"""CONSPIRACY:The Trial of The Chicago 8"" was an expertly made live TV drama,that told the true story of the 8 people,charged
with conspiracy to cause riots during the 1968 Chicago Democratic conventions,and the violent Police brutality that followed,which
was a true,but painful part of the Civil Rights era of the late 60s! director Jeremy Kagan used creative visual video effects,that gave
this made for Cable TV movie, a true look and feel,that reflected those unfortunate events! the expert use of the real ""Chicago 8""
defendants,and the talented actors who played them,showed an authentic and accurate realism that made this drama both realistic
and greatly superior,beyond the average! i was amazed that this work wasn't nominated for an Emmy,,but the preformance that the
cast of actors gave,was both a real treat,and a superior piece of work,that'll make this 1987 Cable drama a true and beloved classic!
Micheal Lembeck was fantastic,playing ""Abbie Hoffman"",totally believable and superior! Robert Loggia playing ""William Kunsler"" also
delivers a knockout preformance,too! but the actor who played ""Judge Hoffman"" also deserves high praise-David Opatoshu,may he rest in peace,was an amazing and talented man,who was well known on TV in the 50s and 60s,and as Judge Hoffman,he gave a stand-out preformance,as did Harris Yulin and Robert Carradine,,all great actors! i would highly recommend this DVD to those,who
appreciate great live TV drama,and expert directing,as well as outstanding acting,,it doesn't get any better then this!",1412726400,2,1539,5.553191489361702
7816873,3,630192858X,i remember watching this on tv. it went for a long time. the best bit is when they bind and gag the militant. good viewing.,1384128000,,123,3.96
7816874,5,630192858X,"While there have been several attempts to film the story of the Chicago 8/7, with a new one coming out any day now, this early HBO film remains the best & most compelling version. Its script drawn entirely from the court records, it benefits from its rather Brechtian approach: it not only pulls back to allow us to see the crew at work, but offers the actual defendants of the trial some 20 years afterward, watching the actors playing their younger selves, while those actual defendants comment on the action. Rather than being an uncertain combination of documentary & drama, with not enough of either to satisfy the viewer, it actually has the strengths of both. It can be viewed simply as gripping courtroom drama, made all the more powerful by the realization that it actually happened; but it also works as both documentary & reflective memoir as well. Its message of denying & defying the authority of the State -- political, military, corporate -- is all the more vital today. And it serves as a reminder of a time when Americans were willing & eager to question everything, rather than simply accepting the mass-produced, comforting illusions sold to them by the consumer society. If nothing else comes of the newest attempt to film this story, perhaps it'll allow for a new DVD release of this fine film at a reasonable price. it's certainly deserving of a new generation of viewers, who need to see it -- highly recommended!",1381017600,5,1436,4.771084337349397
7816875,5,630192858X,This is a powerful movie about the riots during the Democratic National Convention. What a story on how our country's mindset was during that time. It keeps you on edge and just shows you how the previous generation thinks about the current generation during that time frame. We learned a lot about ourselves during that time in history. It is well written and graphic depicting the court procedures during the trial. Both sides were out-of-control; the youth and the judicial system. Keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end of the movie.,1332547200,,547,4.768421052631579
7816876,5,630192858X,"I saw this documentary when it first came out and it made a huge impact on me. Imagine going on trial for a crime you really didn't commit and then to be bound and gagged when you don't ""play by the rules"" in a rigged courtroom!
This really is a must see DVD yet it has been discontinued! Strange, don't you think? All part of that ""freedom"" thing, I guess. Now if you want to buy it you need to fork over 4 to 5 times more than the going price for a old documentary. THE SYSTEM!",1262131200,2,479,3.948453608247423
7816877,5,630192858X,This is an amazing HBO production that re-enacts the trial of the Chicago 8 with running commentary by the actual defendants.  So when an actor portraying Bobby Seal is shown bound and gagged in the courtroom the movie stops and the real Bobby Seal comes on the screen and tells how he was feeling and what he was thinking at that moment.  Very moving and a vivid display of how far off track the legal system had gotten.  A cautionary tale for the current times.,1023926400,4,463,4.423529411764706
7816878,5,630192858X,A very well acted movie.  It combines dialogue from the actual trial transcripts with interviews with most of the main participants.  I highly recommend it.,1012608000,10,156,5.2
